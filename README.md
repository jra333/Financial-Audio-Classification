# Audio Sentiment Analysis and Classification within the Financial Domain 

Using the Binance cryptocurrency exchange API client BTC data were obtained and examined, culminating in the construction of five distinct regression models to predict next day's close price as a function of its inferred financial market indicator statistics. Three were built using linear regression algorithms: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Lasso, and Ridge. One was built using the Random Forest Regression (RFR) algorithm. Then last, one was built using a Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) recurrent neural network.

From our compiled audio files we aim to solve the lack of audio analysis surrounding the financial industry, more notably market sentiment. Traditional sentiment analysis usually utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) with text but it can sometimes lack in depth and practicality regarding its interpretability. One reason might be due to NLP being bound to only textual information thus disregarding the many other facets that contribute to an indivduals sentiment. By classifying audio segments extracted from over 11,0000 YouTube videos in three distinct classes ("bullish", "bearish" and "neutral"), we are able to identify commonalities parallel to their respective class. Initially, these shared attributes are found using two different approaches, one being from each audios spectral profile using *Mel Frequency Cepstral Co-efficients* (MFCC) and the other being its temporal profile (i.e. energy, amplitute, magnitude, zero crossing rate etc.), both of which contribute towards acquirig unique features. The derived features are then utilized by two deep learning neural networks, a CNN and RNN. The CNN is used on the spectral properties of the audios while the RNN is utilized for their temporal properties.
