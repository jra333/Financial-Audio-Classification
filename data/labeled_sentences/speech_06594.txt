NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this technical analysis video for Monday December 16th and the European market here the exam.com."
BEAR1|So looking at the daily chart European continues to face downside pressure despite reaching a three year low of 80 to 75 on Friday.
NEUT2|Are more interesting.
BEAR3|Lee, however, is the fact that the price is just around the base of its three year old range bound trading scene at 83 and all of the other size located below its 30 oversold mark.
BEAR4|The indicator has yet to show signs of reversing.
BEAR5|There are 10 concern over here continues to fall below the blue changes in line while the Mac D has resumed its negative momentum.
NEUT6|Below thread signal line.
BEAR7|Therefore, the short term bias current is currently viewed as a bearish and the focus is on the downside.
NEUT8|In case the 83 level fails to hold, then the next key support could come somewhere between 8160 and 81 where the price change direction several times before 2016.
NEUT9|This is also where the 50% fibo Nachi over the.
NEUT10|Public from all point 6935.
NEUT11|Twelve point 9323 is located so it should attract attention.
NEUT12|Closing below that area we oh point 80 level could be a psychological importance.
NEUT13|While deeper the 61.8% Fibonacci for 7836 could be the next target.
BULL14|Now looking for resistance levels and now we need to rally above all point 8470, which proved a restrictive for last week and also back in March to resume buying confidence.
BEAR15|But but the the 38.2% people natural, four point 8398 and the 20 day moving average could block their way up even more than the market managers to break above 480-770-8470 and the 20 day moving average.
NEUT16|Then we might see another retest of the 86.
NEUT17|And oh point, 8655 area are finally turning to the medium term picture.
BEAR18|The sentiment here remains strongly bearish as long as the price shows no signs of reversing its downtrend of the 10 year high of four point 9323 and the 50 day moving average keeps falling below the longer term 200 day moving average.
NEUT19|So that's all from me.
BULL20|Thanks for watching.
BULL21|"Have a great day."""
