BULL0|"""Every thank you for joining this is going to be quick TA #6."
NEUT1|The purpose is just really get you know everybody's heads around exactly the simple, easiest ways to trade.
NEUT2|I get a lot of request now for some TA and how identify opportunities.
NEUT3|So this is Amazon and if you've been tracking my stuff Amazon is a perfect range rider.
NEUT4|What I mean by that is it flows like a snake up and down, up and down, tops and bottoms.
NEUT5|So real quick.
NEUT6|I always had this trendline this green trendline here, and I get an alert on tradingview, if ever Amazon dips down and I just got that notification right here on when we broke through that support level of about 3200.
NEUT7|Amazon is now 3100 right now.
NEUT8|I build these lines.
NEUT9|Basically, over 6 to 9 month periods and I watched the range I get very familiar with it and then I use this tool here.
NEUT10|This tool on the left as well as my trendline here to identify exactly what that range looks like and it's incredible.
NEUT11|It's uncanny how it actually works.
NEUT12|So back in June 2020 you can see Amazon with 2675 rolled all the way up to 3500, dip down again.
BEAR13|Down to 3100 all the way up to 3450 down again to 3000 and then range range range range range dipped again here to the bottom 3100.
BULL14|Went up to 3425 and here we are now 3100 again so Amazon has really good fundamentals.
BULL15|It's a great long term hold.
BULL16|And we're getting close to a very good entry point, and this is where I would consider getting into a leap.
NEUT17|Option not yet.
NEUT18|Not investment advice.
NEUT19|Just saying the idea.
NEUT20|This video is for you at all to practice.
NEUT21|Identify your top ten stocks and use these tools to identify, entry and exit points.
NEUT22|And follow that range.
NEUT23|Now let's just verify this one more time with RSI.
NEUT24|See what the RSI tells us as you guys know.
NEUT25|I like RSI, always A10, not at 14.
BEAR26|It defaults to 14.
NEUT27|I like 10.
NEUT28|And here again, once again RSI.
NEUT29|It nailed once it hit 30 it nailed that bottom that entry point.
NEUT30|Say it missed it here.
NEUT31|Didn't hit 30 here and it didn't hit 30 all the way until now today 29.71.
NEUT32|So now I've got two affirmations.
BEAR33|One, it broke my trendline and the RSI is below 30, which normally is an entry signal.
BEAR34|But the market still very red.
NEUT35|Now, as always, I was very.
NEUT36|Not bearish, but uncertain, but two or three experiment started moving to hedging positions, but now this is the time where you can start making your lists of targets and wait for those good buying opportunities.
NEUT37|An Amazon might be one for those people to think long term.
NEUT38|Again, they are the biggest store on Earth.
BULL39|An one of the biggest companies on Earth and a good long term hold so hope everybody got that, remember?
NEUT40|Identify your top 10.
NEUT41|Map them out.
NEUT42|Build your trendlines.
NEUT43|Understand how they move.
NEUT44|I look at your RSI and identify your entry points.
BULL45|"Thanks all."""
