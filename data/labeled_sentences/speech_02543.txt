NEUT0|"""From the FT in London, here's the latest on markets."
BULL1|Last week we were all waiting for Friday afternoon pearls of wisdom from Janet Yellen, and that kept a little market moves.
NEUT2|This week.
NEUT3|We're all waiting for Friday afternoon, U.S. jobs data and that's keeping a little market moves.
NEUT4|It is, after all, still August.
NEUT5|Just still.
BEAR6|There are some movements out there.
BULL7|The dollar is still climbing, particularly against the yen, and that's given Japanese stocks.
BULL8|Another boost, but it's failed to continue in Europe, where stocks are roughly flat.
BEAR9|Oil continues to weaken.
BEAR10|My persistent chatter about freezing output with Iraq's Prime Minister supporting such a plan.
NEUT11|The market reaction in a nutshell.
NEUT12|Yeah right.
NEUT13|Meanwhile, the Fed Stan Fischer is still drawing attention.
NEUT14|Yesterday he made it clear that the Fed is willing to move if economic data justify it.
NEUT15|We can't assume the Fed is 1 and done.
NEUT16|He said no pressure payrolls.
BULL17|He also suggested that a strong dollar would not necessarily stop the Fed from pulling the trigger on another rate.
BEAR18|Rise that really challenges a key assumption in markets at the moment.
NEUT19|"New month, new formula let's see."""
