BULL0|"""Only Bitcoin has jumped around about 8.3% in the past few hours, and it's going to be very, very key to where the Bitcoin price goes next."
NEUT1|Couple different things going on #1 they're talking about like the supply of Bitcoin #2.
NEUT2|They're talking about whales coming in, so just watch out for the Bitcoin, you know.
NEUT3|Don't get caught when bitcoins like Sky rocketing downward, and you're just holding onto your money.
NEUT4|So just the heads up watch.
NEUT5|It's only Monday, right now.
NEUT6|We'll see what happens.
BEAR7|Stocks were shaky all last week.
NEUT8|There was an article published about three weeks ago from Columbia University indicating that as many as ten people have had kovid that never got tested, which means we have 10 times as many people in this country that are immune.
BULL9|You add that to the vaccinations that have been rolling out, and it's possible we could be approaching herd immunity.
NEUT10|We should know within the next two or three months I don't see at this point that there's enough evidence to say that it's not going to be the same.
NEUT11|For this coverage is we got five or six different strains going out and your flu vaccine is only good for one or two of them.
NEUT12|I don't see how we're going to get current immunity.
NEUT13|Herd immunity is not what we have with the common cold where everybody can get it every year regardless if they've been infected.
NEUT14|Infected by a Trump.
NEUT15|One of this out last year, right?
BEAR16|And the media freaked out.
NEUT17|I assume some lives were saved due to these different measures, but it really came down to a balance between.
NEUT18|The economy.
NEUT19|And public health right?
NEUT20|If you can substitute any other race, Creed, color or or whatever in that same position that you're making a reference to an, it sounds wrong.
NEUT21|It probably is wrong, but I really want to see the source of this.
NEUT22|You know, it's not that I don't think it's not true, but I think it's definitely.
NEUT23|You know, we need to get some good evidence behind it.
NEUT24|Thursday, CPAC one of the largest, most well known conservative conferences in the country.
NEUT25|We will kick off for the first time in Orlando.
NEUT26|Scheduled speakers include former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, as well as Florida Republicans Governor Ron DeSantis and Senator Rick Scott.
NEUT27|It'll be very, very interesting, though to see what he says.
NEUT28|What the conservative leadership says about the future of the movement, maybe in indications of potential running mates for 2024.
NEUT29|And you know how close they are going to get to Trump.
NEUT30|I think it's going to be very important.
NEUT31|The Republican Party doesn't have anything other than Trump.
NEUT32|That's the problem.
NEUT33|I mean, they don't have any morals, obviously.
NEUT34|'cause when they own the house, the Senate, technically the Supreme Court and the White House, they didn't do Jack squat.
NEUT35|You got a bunch of pansy's up there, you know.
NEUT36|Basically, saying, you know we're just fighting the Democrats for what?
NEUT37|What are you fighting him on?
NEUT38|Why are you fighting him on?
BEAR39|It's really in latest, Scott Morrison vowed to push ahead with laws to force Facebook to pay news outlets for content on Friday, world leaders and Australian politicians have blasted the social media giant.
BEAR40|And accused it of bullying after its drastic decision to block news content in Australia can understand where the news companies saying we drive traffic to Facebook because people want to read our news and Facebook saying, well, the only reason people want to read your news is we drive traffic to you right?
NEUT41|And for everybody else, that's normally a free service 'cause it's mutually agreeable for everybody.
BULL42|Hey, thanks for watching the red, white Matt show with Kenny.
