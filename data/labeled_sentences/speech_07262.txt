NEUT0|"""If there's one area where Donald Trump has really made a mark in the early days of his presidency, it's in the currency market, not so much making exchange rates volatile, but putting the world on."
NEUT1|Notice that he cares about them.
NEUT2|Why well, for years Mr. Trump has argued that in some cases the foreign exchange playing field is not exactly level.
BEAR3|He has claimed that competition between American companies.
BEAR4|And their rivals is unfair because other countries have been deliberately keeping their currencies lope.
BEAR5|A higher dollar is bad news for American exporters, and now that he is president, he intends to do something about it already.
BEAR6|He has accused China, Japan and Germany of currency manipulation and currency.
BULL7|Experts say he may have a point on some measures.
BEAR8|The dollar does look overvalued against some of its key trading.
NEUT9|Notably, the euro and the yen.
BEAR10|It's a hard accusation to level against Germany since it does not control the euro.
BULL11|While many argue that China, far from trying to weaken the renminbi, has been taking active measures to shore it up because of worries about capital fleeing the country, and when Mr. Trump met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abbe in February, not only did they appear to get on just fine, but Mr Arbeit returned home to claim.
NEUT12|That the US president accepted that Japanese monetary policy was geared not to manipulating the currency, but ending deflation.
NEUT13|So where does this get us?
NEUT14|We're not terribly far.
NEUT15|Mr. Trump has put the issue on the table, and there are plenty of ways for his accusations to be rebuffed.
NEUT16|But in the broader game, Mr. Trump wants to renegotiate U.S. trade on a bilateral basis, and so long as his currency manipulation card remains on the.
BEAR17|"Table America's competitors will be wary about how their currencies trade against the mighty dollar."""
