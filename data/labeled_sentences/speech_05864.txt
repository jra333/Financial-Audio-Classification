BULL0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the S&P 500 and you can see that we are starting to recover a bit after initially selling off during the session in Asia."
NEUT1|And really, what this tells me?
NEUT2|And less we get some type of news we're going to stay right in this range.
NEUT3|A little back and forth.
NEUT4|The range bound trading available 200 day MA will be the target to the outside.
NEUT5|I don't see us breaking above there anytime soon, but it's obvious that the market doesn't want to break down either.
NEUT6|I like fading rallies if you're a little bit more of a short term trader though you can go back and forth.
NEUT7|It's just you're going to have to be careful of any headline risks.
NEUT8|It won't be surprised at all to see Friday, maybe slightly positive, but basically write them at all.
NEUT9|"There's a range."""
