NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another episode of Bubble Trading."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|I'm gonna be doing some cryptocurrency technical analysis for the ticker BT, which is BitTorrent.
NEUT3|I'm going to look at it against tether US and it's going to be charted based off of the finance price.
NEUT4|So if you guys enjoy this video, go ahead and hit the like button and subscribe comment.
NEUT5|Let me know anything else you want to see.
NEUT6|And without, let's kick it off.
NEUT7|So as a disclaimer, I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT8|This video is not financial advice, nothing I talk about should be taken as financial advice.
NEUT9|This is all just my opinion and should be taken as such.
NEUT10|Just use it for entertainment, right?
NEUT11|Just speak to a financial advisor if you invest.
BEAR12|So looking at the chart here, I was talking about this one yesterday night, so this was on this green candle here on March 20th, so we have this huge upper Wick and we had a rather weak close on this one below the .003 cent mark.
NEUT13|So I'd kind of been talking.
NEUT14|I'll get today if you go back and watch the video.
BEAR15|I said if it had lost .033 we could potentially see .003 and then below that even lower.
NEUT16|So if you were patient.
BEAR17|After that video you could have potentially caught a dip around the .003 mark or lower.
BEAR18|'cause this did go as low as .002.
BULL19|About 0028, so I mean, this one did give a pretty good dip opportunity from the video that I had made.
NEUT20|So I think if you pull this up here, this is the four hour chart.
BEAR21|Now as you can see, it kind of pull back a little pop, but I really pulled back hard here.
NEUT22|So now that it's having a lot better today, today I just want to find some things that you can potentially expect in some levels to watch.
BEAR23|So again, this is a chart pattern I talked about so often the big move up high and tight consolidation of break of previous highs.
BEAR24|So on the four hour chart you can see here it broke and closed at its highest point on the four hour chart, which was around at 0035 Cent Mark.
NEUT25|And this level is now becoming a support level, so it broke through the resistance resistance and now turns into support.
NEUT26|So that's one level I'd be watching.
BEAR27|If that doesn't hold, most likely I would expect the price to dip somewhere in this .0033 or even 003 like 2 high 2 range.
NEUT28|So those are some of the levels I be watching at this point.
BULL29|This chart does look constructive once again, so if I pull up even closer to the one hour chart.
NEUT30|One of the big spots to watch, in my opinion at this point on the one hour is going to be this .0038 cent mark.
BULL31|This one's having a hard time closing above it on the one hour chart again, but like I said, big move up some sideways action.
NEUT32|It's approaching previous highs, so break of that if it has volume similar to this green volume.
NEUT33|When it gets through this price right here and starts to look strong, I don't see why this can't go up to the .004 or even higher range.
NEUT34|Obviously, the support levels kind of line up from chart to chart that .00 like.
NEUT35|3/5 level on the four hour and the one hour is the spot to watch for support and I'll show you right here.
NEUT36|Anything below that .003 to .00 like 325 ish is the next level of support.
BEAR37|If it starts to lose that.
BEAR38|I mean this chart won't look as healthy to me anymore and it would start to put in a really.
NEUT39|It was hard to put in a pretty wiki.
NEUT40|Candle here if it pulls back in the next couple of hours, or you know, just start to pull back and then maybe you have to reconstruct itself before another leg up or another leg down.
NEUT41|So that's just what I'm seeing on this chart.
NEUT42|If you agree with what I'm saying, let me know, and if you disagree and you think the price is going to do something else, let me know as well.
NEUT43|"And with that being said, guys, thank you very much for watching and just remember, go ahead and like, comment, subscribe and share, thanks."""
