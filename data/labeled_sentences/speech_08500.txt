NEUT0|"""It's clean this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Will Apple finally acted human here a little bit today with a bit of a pullback an in doing so has really offered up to cut and dry levels from the technical point of view, an you know these are levels where I don't want to come across that.
NEUT5|This is some sort of, you know, greatest cover on my part or special skill.
NEUT6|Quite the opposite, actually.
NEUT7|I assure you, people that use charts understand charts have taken notice of both these levels that I'm going to talk about.
NEUT8|And I make that comment because when lots of people are watching the same areas and wondering the same thing, called a cellphone prophecy card.
NEUT9|If you want the price can definitely create some very dynamic movements.
NEUT10|In the first level here that a lot of people watching, including the shorts, is this area right here, around 498 and nothing is guaranteed to happen, but it's a.
NEUT11|It's a rational thought to have, and that is that Apple is up a lot.
NEUT12|I mean, Apple has gone on a monster move, so the thought of you know there's not necessarily the price needs to crash, but at least a little bit more of a pullback.
NEUT13|And people are going to be watching that level again, a breakthrough.
BEAR14|That level could very well create downward side selling pressure.
BEAR15|When I say downside selling pressure again, I don't mean and therefore sending this thing down to $200.
NEUT16|I'm not saying that.
BULL17|But even if the price pulls back to, you know the 475 ish area from a training standpoint, you know that that could be a very, you know, profitable trade.
NEUT18|So that's going to be again a level that a whole lot of people are going to be watching.
NEUT19|On the flip side though, those people that love to play breakouts, those people that enjoy going long then that 508 mark is going to be.
NEUT20|It's a very fascinating level, 'cause that's as high as it could get.
BEAR21|Yet the price gapped up pulled back came back upwards and then tried several times to get through there and couldn't quite do it.
NEUT22|Now, is this a guarantee of anything?
NEUT23|No, again guarantees don't exist, but is it?
NEUT24|A valid is it?
NEUT25|Irrational thoughts have that if the price can work its way up to five white and then get the break of that, that could create some.
NEUT26|You know continuation of the trend?
NEUT27|Yeah, absolutely, that's valid.
NEUT28|But just because it's valid doesn't mean that it's guaranteed to happen, but those are going to be two months ago levels that I'm personally watching going forward, and I think a lot of other traders will be watching.
NEUT29|So let's see what happens with them.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird.
NEUT35|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT36|But in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT43|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT44|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
