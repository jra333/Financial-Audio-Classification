BULL0|"""Welcome back guys."
NEUT1|Today we're going to be looking at magnet stock, ticker, symbol, MG and I and I'm going to be discussing and explaining why I think the stock is about to absolutely rocket in the coming weeks.
NEUT2|We're going to look at its momentum and we're going to be looking at one of its competitors, the Trade Desk Company, which is valued around 45 billion.
NEUT3|It's too big company compared to Mag night, and we're going to do a little bit of analysis on its balance sheet compared to magnets.
NEUT4|Balance sheet.
NEUT5|Ann, why I think Magnus stock is on the burst.
NEUT6|So firstly, magnate was recommended by one of these big hedge funds and they actually called out Fubo TV earlier two months ago and now they've actually given it a high target, so this is fubo and it's trading at $62.00 now.
NEUT7|About like two months ago in November it was trading at $12.00 an as you can see on my momentum graph it has a lot of momentum right now.
BULL8|It's sitting at the 27 ranges and it's building up a lot of momentum, so with magnet that can be the case and it has got a bull rating and it's the stock pick of the year by the same firm.
NEUT9|I'm going to hit up the link for this firm down below in the description for you guys to check out.
NEUT10|An mag Nine has the.
BULL11|Momentum also pretty much maxed out over here so it can pull back, but it is trading right now.
NEUT12|15% up afterhours value gate at $3 billion, so the comparison between trade desk is that trade desk is valued at $45 billion and I just want to look at the revenue streams between the two companies.
NEUT13|We know that trade desk is quite profitable.
BULL14|Its earnings growth has been pretty good like 50% increase every single year.
BULL15|And it's been profitable for the past four years, with 20 million in earnings.
NEUT16|Then the year after 50 million, than 88 million.
NEUT17|And then you got 108 million guys.
NEUT18|On the other case, you go magnet, which is kind of taking its losses away.
NEUT19|It had a loss of 154 million and then a 61 million and then 25 million.
BULL20|And I do believe next year in May be in for a profit.
NEUT21|Its revenue is 156,000,000 versus.
NEUT22|Trade desk's revenue, which is 661 million in revenue.
BULL23|And they both add at online advertising companies, so they're both in the same sector, and I think this values magnet quite cheaply an if it can increase its sales and then next one to two years I can see the stock going up 10X with the valuation of three boon for this company.
NEUT24|That's it for this video.
BULL25|This stock is gaining a lot of momentum.
BULL26|I hope you guys can catch it.
NEUT27|I don't own any stock personally and I'm willing to buy this stock if it just doesn't go up like 50% tomorrow when the market opens.
BULL28|I'm going to try increasing position a little bit on this talk.
NEUT29|I'm sorry I forgot the firm's name that recommended this stock, but it wasn't CNBC.
NEUT30|After hours I've got CNBC pro and so I was watching alive.
NEUT31|I think I should make a tutorial of CNBC Pro and how to use it.
NEUT32|And if it's worth $30 a month.
NEUT33|But other than that, I think that's about eight guys.
BULL34|I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
