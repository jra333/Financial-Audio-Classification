BULL0|"""Hello everybody, good morning and thanks for watching this video on Alibaba stock."
NEUT1|This is part of the stock market and the stock market name is Ba BA so is this one by in front of us.
NEUT2|There is one hour candle stick chart showing the past movement and as usual the goal of this channel is guys to girls let you get confident with technical analysis.
NEUT3|So this is how the prices.
NEUT4|Look like right now in Alibaba on this one of our charter.
NEUT5|This is my interpretation.
NEUT6|This process since March 2 until now.
NEUT7|So this is yes, this is how the processor moving.
NEUT8|I just to help you out, just actually do it myself as well.
NEUT9|How to understand the past movement better?
NEUT10|I do.
NEUT11|Generally I I drove the blue line is the major tenets, black line is the minor trained for the secondary trained.
NEUT12|I found this trend line.
NEUT13|Discrete one etc.
NEUT14|Listen up train.
BEAR15|The soda prices are moving in Appleton condition.
BEAR16|Now there's been the prices have been.
NEUT17|Jump it down or do it to this tension between the US, China.
NEUT18|This is the information that you can find here.
NEUT19|This is based on the fundamental analysis, and as usual, always guys.
NEUT20|Please read a lot of news because fundamentalists is to break up the King analysis and by service so both of them have to be on the same page.
BEAR21|So the reason why the prices jumped down went down.
NEUT22|It's it's because it's newer to this US China tensions.
NEUT23|So now if these frictions between those two counts will keep going on, I think.
NEUT24|There isn't an option option.
BEAR25|See this target price can go down up to 108 U.S. dollar.
NEUT26|The target price is being found.
NEUT27|Just projecting that here the height.
NEUT28|The depth of this peak from the breakout point.
NEUT29|So this this distorted Brewer and just projected from this point down and we got to.
NEUT30|We've got almost 108 U.S. dollar.
NEUT31|These options is not mean depends on depends, again mainly fundamental realities, but that's why I give 10% only general.
NEUT32|What can happen at.
NEUT33|Perhaps the price came.
NEUT34|Break this down the line.
NEUT35|I can found the next resistance or support level so it can be this support level or it can be disrupted.
NEUT36|One one of those two so the classic my job, my go back up to one of these support and then jump up again.
NEUT37|Open up skipping this one jump up again and there is another option where the actually the price will keep following the uptrend.
NEUT38|Date it is these this green line at that you know.
NEUT39|Typically line is updating the, so perhaps he's going to work again as support for the next rally on the price.
NEUT40|So this is my interpretation of this stock right now, so I think we just wait right signal to buy to buy.
BULL41|So to go along, and let's hope that this tension between China US will go quite will will relax a little bit and it immediately buys.
NEUT42|Is is just.
NEUT43|Market is a bullish market so I would not go short on this market personally, so that's why I just let's wait the right signal to go along because both option 4540 fighting at the end.
NEUT44|At the end I think that they will go along.
NEUT45|So this is my understanding on this price.
NEUT46|Prices movement right now based mainly on technical analysis, while fundamental analysis just say say something different.
BEAR47|Perhaps if this frictions between those two counter will keep going on, the prices can keep my keep going down.
NEUT48|So this is my understanding again on this market.
BULL49|I hope you enjoy this video.
NEUT50|"Thanks bye."""
