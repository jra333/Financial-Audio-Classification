BULL0|"""Hello guys and girls, hope you're doing very well."
NEUT1|Just a quick update on gold prices at the moment.
NEUT2|As you can see currently gold is trading on 1731.60 yesterday.
NEUT3|I did say it because it was trying to make a junction between 1440 and 14626 and I did said in my yesterday analysis that it will try to break it.
NEUT4|One side it did try to break but it was a fact breakout which reached up to 1753 and it's it's starting to come down.
NEUT5|Calm down.
NEUT6|Currently it came down towards 1718, but retracement is happening at the moment and currently it's reading around 1731.
NEUT7|If it breaks the 20 moving average which I have set here, I will just show you the setting as well.
NEUT8|If you can see the setting.
NEUT9|These are my 20 moving average setting.
NEUT10|You can put in your system as well and the fibbonaci which I have set as well.
NEUT11|These are the setting and it's it's giving an exact bounced check.
NEUT12|Bounce back positions and I'm using trading view.
NEUT13|You can go to firetradewithassim.com and you can find the trade you charge there as well and you can.
NEUT14|You can set it for yourself from there.
BULL15|Now moving into the the stage, I would I would be expecting that it will try to break this level of around which is around 1735 F. It achieves to break 1735.
NEUT16|Once again it will track which in 1753 an above the maximum target to upwards direction.
NEUT17|If it breaks this level it is going to be around 1760, which is this level.
BULL18|But if it got bounced back from this level, which I'm expecting that it will bounce back.
NEUT19|I would expect that it will fall fall back, you know, hold down below the pivot and it will try to attend the support at 1690, but it will happen on Friday is so much movement had happened between around 50.
BEAR20|Sorry around 4:30 Dollar movement has happened and currently it's it's doing its retracement so it's going to be really early on.
NEUT21|Which side is going to go?
BEAR22|But I would expect that it might fall down.
NEUT23|Why I'm telling you guys?
NEUT24|Because if we give go to the daily chart?
BEAR25|Currently it's below the support and it's getting bounced back at the support level which is here, which is been a temporary support around 1740 area and if it goes below sea it is trying to go be about these lines and it's bouncing back and it's coming down to 1718 and it's trying to go back again and the buyers are pushing it up but it's not breaking these levels so it is going to be like a, you know an area whereby we do expect that.
NEUT26|Who attracts you can sell at the highest one and buy at the lowest one.
BULL27|And you guys can make some nice profits.
