NEUT0|"""Oh wait outside for a bike."
NEUT1|The first beautiful day of spring here in New York City and I got tons of messages.
NEUT2|People asking me what the heck is going on with MC?
BULL3|Well Ames is above $11.00 guys but the MCS holding the $11.00 mark even after market hours, Ames is going up well guys.
NEUT4|Obviously some people learn that they have to hold the stock when you hold the stock.
NEUT5|This is what you're going to see on the screen.
NEUT6|OK guys, let's go over the details.
NEUT7|It's not only about.
NEUT8|That some people just bought more shares, hold more shares, nobody sell or even the day traders or swing states were much less today.
NEUT9|But let's go over the details that actually boost the price on the next level.
NEUT10|We got confirmation from MC that the theaters in away will reopen next week rather than next month.
BULL11|This is a big big step.
BULL12|A big move that will boost the stock price during the next week, but as well, no, money never sleeps, so the money is not going to wait till next week.
BEAR13|People are already blank more and more this week.
NEUT14|I just visit Wallstreetbets think a lot of people sharing their screenshots, bought more shares from MC.
NEUT15|People are holding the line and the best of all guys is that people are coming with different sources, different researchers, someone shared that the newest prediction from Fidelity is that the potential for MC growing in the next 90 days each huge some numbers that we still cannot confirm as that in the next 90 days.
NEUT16|You can see me start going from 400 to 600 evil.
NEUT17|Some people predicted that.
BULL18|A message that can actually hit $900 in the next 90 days.
NEUT19|So guys, let's act very, very smart.
NEUT20|What we're seeing right now.
BULL21|It's same thing that we saw during the last two weeks when we got the news that aims theaters will reopen on 25 capacity here in New York City.
NEUT22|The same news is coming from away.
NEUT23|We already know that the two most profitable locations from AMC theatres are in New York City and LA.
NEUT24|The previous week we saw five different cinemas reopening.
BULL25|In San Francisco, so guys, little by little we will have all the AMC theatres reopening at the same time and we have the Q4 earnings report extremely high.
BEAR26|Another thing that I'm seeing on Wallstreetbets very important people are already dealing with the negative impact over the Q4 earnings report.
NEUT27|People are smart, people are realistic.
NEUT28|Nobody is saying that he, you know they might be positive.
NEUT29|Most likely they won't be positive.
NEUT30|They raced over $2 billion, so this means that they need more liquidy.
NEUT31|They need more cash.
NEUT32|This is why there is more capital.
NEUT33|So let's face it.
BEAR34|The Q4 earnings report won't be a good news, but people already people are not selling.
NEUT35|People will not fall under this bull trap.
NEUT36|And this is something that during the first short squeeze right after Robin Hood broke the fresh squeeze, we saw a lot of people selling a lot of people fall under the trap, thinking that the stock is done.
NEUT37|And now we're seeing people are already educated.
NEUT38|People already take notes.
NEUT39|From what happened during the first time, people are not selling.
NEUT40|People are saying that you know MC will bounce back.
BULL41|AMC will have amazing Q4 earnings report.
NEUT42|People are saying I'm not going to visit any other cinemas in the future.
NEUT43|I'm part of the family.
NEUT44|I love MC and I'll keep visiting MC forever.
NEUT45|The community guys.
NEUT46|The community is stronger than any other chart that you can look and something that we should always remember.
NEUT47|The community saved AMC before the 1st short squeeze and now the community.
NEUT48|Will get MC profitable.
