NEUT0|"""And now here's Myles with our chart of the day."
NEUT1|Well, today is the Chinese New Year, so we have to celebrate that the way we can, which is by gauging the Chinese economy.
NEUT2|How is that doing?
BULL3|Well, this chart would suggest is doing fine, but not all that great.
NEUT4|So this chart is showing China imports from the EU.
NEUT5|Now.
NEUT6|A couple of caveats here.
NEUT7|First, you'd note that China is mostly an export based economy and that the manufacturing goods that are manufactured in the EU going to China not a major part of that GDP calculation.
NEUT8|But if you want to get a sense of how much.
BEAR9|The economy has slowed down and kind of how sharp that deceleration has been just over the last year.
NEUT10|We are now almost seeing Chinese imports to the EU or excuse me from the EU declining on a year on year basis and this coming only a couple years after we had very negative comps going back to 2014 and 15 and what this dynamic sets up is really one thing for the PBOC to decide does it want to devalue China's currency and make it more competitive on importing basis or does it not want to do that now when we saw?
BEAR11|The Chinese currency devalued back in 2015 stock market financial markets around the world.
BEAR12|They didn't like that so much and I think that's something a lot of people have been wary of.
NEUT13|How much do you want to sacrifice strength in your home economy in order to make you more competitive in a global landscape?
NEUT14|And so, as we mentioned earlier in this program, 2019 is a year we're trying to figure out what exactly is this narrative going to be.
NEUT15|I think Disney, a company after the Bell, is going to have a big part of the US big cap equity talk, right Disney versus Netflix, but I think on a global macro level.
NEUT16|It is all about how fast or how slowly the Chinese economy grows.
NEUT17|What do those official data look like?
NEUT18|And then you look at China's relationship with the US, with the EU and you get kind of a more unvarnished look at how those economies are performing 'cause this is really.
NEUT19|This data comes from the EU right there, sending these goods to China if there's ghost consumption or some sort of smoothing of the data on the Chinese side.
NEUT20|This is not a data set where that is going to happen, and so again, I just think like we can't overstate kind of the change that's happening in the Chinese economy.
BEAR21|It's been so secondary.
NEUT22|What we've been focusing on in the US with lower taxes but the Trump presidency, everything that that entails.
NEUT23|But it does feel like we're setting up for a year when we are laser focused on what's happening over in Asia.
NEUT24|Is it weird that I'm more worried about the EU looking at this chart?
NEUT25|Well that's another way to spend it.
NEUT26|Yeah, sure, that's not.
NEUT27|That wouldn't be completely inappropriate to be worried about the EU.
BULL28|We certainly see a lot of concerning signs from the German economy right now.
NEUT29|You know, Germany is a proxy for how the EU is doing as a whole.
BULL30|Not looking too great there and I think.
NEUT31|You know you could probably move it forward and say, well, the whole global economy is slowing and member synchronized growth was the big theme, right?
NEUT32|As Trump was getting elected, that's really what helped.
BULL33|Markets go higher.
NEUT34|In addition to tax cuts.
BULL35|"So I think that whole story is coming together."""
