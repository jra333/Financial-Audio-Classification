NEUT0|"""Yeah, be TID this morning."
NEUT1|Jim says.
NEUT2|The guidance there is probably conservative, although physical comps, physical comps down 28, I want to talk to you a bit about them all.
NEUT3|Having I know you spoke to Macy's last night, but in the meantime there is the opening Bell on this Wednesday morning.
BULL4|Interesting day at the big board.
NEUT5|It's online education provider Coursera celebrating an IPO.
NEUT6|We're going to talk to the CEO later this morning on Squawk Alley at the NASDAQ.
NEUT7|It's hollow back, a grassroots initiative to end.
NEUT8|Harassment, So what about the mall?
BEAR9|At this point, Jim, having spoken to Gannett last night, put him really, really torn.
BULL10|I mean it, Jeff Jeff Bennett told a pretty good story at Macy's.
NEUT11|Now he he really wanted.
NEUT12|He took pains to distinguish between the A&B walls and the other models.
NEUT13|That is something that David Simon is explained to me over and over again, which is that there are malls that people go to and their most people don't.
NEUT14|And Macy's, I think, is emblematic of the of the customer.
NEUT15|That is middle range that is going back.
NEUT16|The blue means business is fantastic by the way, I always have to do more bloomies 'cause people like them.
BEAR17|They put some back stages within Macy's, but they've closed almost all the stores that they need to close.
NEUT18|And they're saying that if you have a Macy's they do two to three times the digital in that area.
NEUT19|Then if they don't, everyone saying they're leading with digital Carl and you get PVH leading with digitally, you have to say leading with digital, 'cause you look at Target stock where they actually live with digital and you're just kind of saying I want to target.
NEUT20|A lot of companies want to Brian Cornell, but there is only one Brian Cornell who was smart enough to buy shipped as at SHIPT, which those of us who use it or kind of blown away by how good it is.
BULL21|But the PVH is no longer man invented Trico, they they did a good job.
NEUT22|We look at that target.
NEUT23|I mean he Brian Cornell is a visionary and I think that when people use their their.com so to speak their ecom, they're kind of amazed at the ease of it.
NEUT24|But I think Macy's is no longer in the fight for its life.
BULL25|They had a decent quarter.
BULL26|They got good cash flow.
BULL27|They're taking the cost down.
NEUT28|So that is no longer on the.
NEUT29|I don't know the the critical missed Norse is Kohl's, obviously Norse Nordstrom, but look at these look at Target and Walmart.
NEUT30|By the way, it's my Chapel trust owns has been a real dog and I think one of the reasons been real.
BULL31|Dogs and other people are catching up to their great e-commerce but Macy's, I think in that told a pretty good story.
NEUT32|I know there there are people who are dollars and people who say you know what that is.
NEUT33|We're going to see the mall slink back to its lassitude of customers who aren't interested.
NEUT34|I don't think that's true.
BEAR35|I think that the empty malls are getting customers.
NEUT36|People like to shop again.
NEUT37|Remember we used and that was something we were very good at.
NEUT38|You know, was shopping.
NEUT39|And that was when like steel was like #480.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
