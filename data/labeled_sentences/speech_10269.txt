NEUT0|"""Yesterday during a virtual speaking event that I give to the 92nd St Y in Manhattan got issue."
NEUT1|Question is this the end of index investing?
NEUT2|My answer was yes.
NEUT3|While index funds will never really go away, I think we're looking at the end of the conventional wisdom that index funds are the smartest way to invest.
NEUT4|For many years, we've been told that savvy investors should stop trying to beat the market and Simply put their money in a cheap index fund that mirrors the SP 500 long time that was very solid advice, you know, I preach it.
NEUT5|But you know?
NEUT6|He that's not the world we live in anymore.
BEAR7|The pandemic is rendered vast.
BEAR8|Swaths of the market UN investable.
NEUT9|It's very obvious what's not working right now beyond a trade.
BEAR10|So when you buy an index fund that mirrors the S&P 500, you're getting a whole lot of bad with the good.
NEUT11|That's always been the case, it's just right now.
BEAR12|The band is incredibly bad.
NEUT13|By that.
NEUT14|Would you want to put your money in an index with airlines or oil producers?
NEUT15|Restaurants with half the seats taken out so they can pass muster?
NEUT16|Consider this when you zoom out beyond the SNP, and you look at all the major averages.
NEUT17|They each tell a vastly different story.
BEAR18|Yes please the middle the packets down 12% for the year at the end of last week down.
BEAR19|Joshua's are down 16.7 Russell 2000 small cap down 26% brutal on the other hand, the NASDAQ composite was only down 3.8% and get this the NASDAQ 100, the hundred largest non financial stocks.
NEUT20|And as think tech think about deck actually a .6% when you think about it these disparities make tons of sense.
NEUT21|The NASDAQ 100 is a lot of exposure to COVID-19.
NEUT22|Then the Dow, the SP in a positive way.
NEUT23|It's very tech heavy, only big companies so no small cap exposure like the hideous Russell 2000 is a tough time to be a small company.
