NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clearing this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will higher highs and higher lows an the Apple uptrend continues after spending last week?
NEUT5|I mean.
NEUT6|Pull back is even kind of a very lightly used word, but yeah, a very slight minor pullback.
BULL7|Nelson in the price is going up to new highs there.
NEUT8|So like I said the uptrend continues to let's map out some newest areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance so that one of the new levels of support in what I would call the ideal lovers Lane won't make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT9|Going forward.
NEUT10|That would be if the price can say up there above 135 now.
NEUT11|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 135.
NEUT12|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price.
BULL13|Could manage step above that area.
BULL14|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT15|Taking a step back and looking at all of this from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move.
NEUT18|This right here being defined as quote unquote, the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line.
BULL20|As line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT21|The Bulls are in full control, having best visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT22|Yes, staying above 135 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned, they just don't matter.
NEUT23|What do I mean by that?
NEUT24|What matters the most is what the price is already been doing, and that's just right here.
NEUT25|Just chipping away in building these higher lows, or if you want to envision these stair steps.
NEUT26|So in other words, as long as there are steps continue to construct themselves in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT27|So folks and healthy consolidations focus on chipping away and building those higher bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL31|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
