NEUT0|"""As we talk to consumers know they're looking for certainty around when is this virus going to be behind us?"
NEUT1|When will there be a vaccine?
NEUT2|What's going to happen with the economy when the kids go back to school and none of us today have that answer?
NEUT3|The bike in package of certainty would be the top selling item I sold at Target today.
NEUT4|So as we think the 2021, we've got to be really flexible and adapt to the current and changing environment.
NEUT5|As Brian Cornell, course CEO of Target and that is the focus of our Mad Dash, what do you think of the quarter wow?
BULL6|I mean, I think that this was so impressive that I think people are going to stay with target.
BULL7|It was magnificent and the digital comparable store sales 155%.
NEUT8|I don't know how you do that, I don't know, but that's 'cause of shipped like David.
NEUT9|One day I went to Dillon Reebok, who's a staff member of money and I have a belt symbol shipped.
NEUT10|Two hours later, really nice belt, really yes or you gotta you ship?
NEUT11|I mean, you can just wing it like we can get election ship together like Alexa.
NEUT12|Send David a new tie.
NEUT13|That's nicer than the one he's wearing.
NEUT14|That could be done.
NEUT15|I mean, pretty much any tie.
BEAR16|So I do think that people have to remember that Brian Cornell is pulled off.
NEUT17|Oh, stop it.
BEAR18|Brian Cornell is pulled off one of the great terms.
NEUT19|Yeah, he doesn't get enough credit to his point.
NEUT20|So no, certainly still not giving us any guidance.
NEUT21|Longer calling it highly fluid and uncertain outlook for consumer shopping patterns, I think he's going to crush the holiday season.
NEUT22|You do?
NEUT23|Yes, because it's fun.
NEUT24|You go in there.
NEUT25|I have fewer people going to be going in, though.
NEUT26|Well, it doesn't matter.
NEUT27|You shipped.
NEUT28|So right, I mean, you obviously they're going to be relying a lot on their digital strategy, as I don't go in anymore.
NEUT29|Every reason I don't go anymore.
NEUT30|You don't.
NEUT31|No, I don't.
NEUT32|I am a total shipped user.
NEUT33|Why am I going to go in?
NEUT34|But I'm going?
NEUT35|Will you go back in after the pandemic?
NEUT36|You will 'cause you love endemic?
NEUT37|Of course I'm going to go back.
NEUT38|Yeah, I'm gonna go, I'll buy I'll I love going I'll Bob it's like one of the greatest things.
BULL39|Hey, by the way I have to say the existential crisis of Kohl's has been solved by some great merchandise, coal.
NEUT40|Call what you were negative on Coles yesterday.
NEUT41|Let me did.
BULL42|They did better.
NEUT43|I mean come on what about?
