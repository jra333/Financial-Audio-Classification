NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Monday, February 1st and the market just closed.
NEUT2|In this video I'm going to be talking about sundial growers.
NEUT3|Ticker symbol SMDL.
BULL4|Today, Sundial had a great day were up 48.50% almost at 1.21.
BULL5|Even before the market opened were up free market 5th 40%.
BULL6|So overall it was a great day.
NEUT7|In the last video was talking about this upward trend line and I wanted to make sure we open above the .80, which we definitely did.
BULL8|We open almost at the point almost the $1.00 range looking at the RSI we could see here that we are in overbought territory and the Mac is also showing a very strong bullish movement which is normal for a 40 plus increase.
NEUT9|In the stock price.
NEUT10|Zooming into the hourly chart, one thing I'm watching here is this upper trendline, as you see that we were hovering around that, and today we had the breakout above that.
BULL11|On Friday we had the side wave movement around the support line of .75 and that helped very nicely.
NEUT12|Obviously what I'm watching for is this red line over here, which is the 20 Ma line.
NEUT13|Now I know Sundial always touches that line every time it wants to consolidate for a bit.
NEUT14|So it's one thing I'm watching out.
NEUT15|Weather are we going to see a sideway movement until the 20 Ma line catches up, or are we going to see an upward touch of this trend line, which I drew here?
NEUT16|A few days back.
NEUT17|Which is roughly around the 1.4.
NEUT18|Dollar range.
NEUT19|And then get it to catch up with the 20 email line.
NEUT20|So this is one thing to watch out for.
BULL21|If tomorrow we open up above the $1.00 range we could see easily a rally back up to the 1.4 and then we get that tested and see if that's going to break out or not.
NEUT22|And if that doesn't happen we could see possibly a day of sideway movement until we catch up to the 20 email line.
NEUT23|And then we could see a retest.
NEUT24|Of the 1.4 download.
NEUT25|A Priceline so watch for these two prices.
BULL26|"I hope you find this video helpful and as usual, thank you all for watching and see you in the next video."""
