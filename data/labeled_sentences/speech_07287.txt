BULL0|"""Bullish calls I mentioned them before on Disney."
NEUT1|A couple of them today.
NEUT2|Let's go through it guys because you've got initiated, overweight at KeyBank 177 is the price.
NEUT3|Target their upgraded to overweight at wells you gotta Street High 182 Farmer Jim you own Disney.
NEUT4|Yeah, and I think there's a very simple analysis here.
NEUT5|It's some of the parts these analysts most analysts are looking at Disney catching up with the subscriber count of Netflix in the next year or two.
NEUT6|That's pretty big.
NEUT7|Pretty big gains, but assuming it happens, Netflix market cap is about 2:25 billion.
NEUT8|Right now Disney's is 280 billion.
NEUT9|That means basically, you've got a Netflix in Disney and you've got every other business valued at 55 billion.
NEUT10|Well, those other businesses, studios, theme parks, etc.
NEUT11|Earned 17 billion.
NEUT12|In 2019, so you're talking a three times multiple on those businesses.
BULL13|Yes, I get we're in a pandemic, but we're going to come out of it.
NEUT14|It's a question of when and three times the rest of those businesses is way too cheap, so some of the parts completely supports being long Disney right now.
NEUT15|Yeah, new New 52 week high today the high today 157 and 46 P. You got out a while back.
NEUT16|What would get you back in?
NEUT17|You know, I've seen some options that that intrigued me.
NEUT18|Scott recently they were out there are going out to June.
NEUT19|This is very recently going out to June.
NEUT20|The 165 strike, but that stocks made an unbelievable move.
NEUT21|I think at the time of that by it was stock was 146 here you said.
NEUT22|157 today it's about 1:55.
NEUT23|Now you know I love this company.
NEUT24|I love just about everything about him.
NEUT25|The one aspect of it, and I know Jim looks at this stuff closer than I do every every single day.
NEUT26|But it feels like it's a little bit lofty to me.
NEUT27|And the reason I say that is look at where the PE is now.
NEUT28|Forward PE is for Disney and we see this in a lot of these great names and we all know that as as we get the vaccines as we come out of this, the rest of the portfolio of Disney will start to kick in and add to the streaming in the DTC all the rest of it.
NEUT29|So I understand it.
NEUT30|I guess I'm just waiting on any kind of a pullback.
BULL31|Scott, I love the move.
NEUT32|I was in the stock then I eventually got into just the options themselves.
BEAR33|Now I'm not in there and I'm kicking myself a little bit because I've missed at least the last 10 points or so on this run.
NEUT34|Is that a real backdrop?
NEUT35|Pete and they don't have palm trees on Lake Minne Tonka.
NEUT36|I know that.
NEUT37|You don't have to tell us where you are at work.
NEUT38|I'll tell you where I'm at.
NEUT39|I'm down in your neck of the Woods, in my neck of the Woods Man, Tampa, FL.
NEUT40|I'm actually in Saint Pete right now.
