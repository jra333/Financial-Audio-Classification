NEUT0|"""It's clearing this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, another very very impressive day here on Apple.
NEUT4|Although I will say that the last 30 minutes had a goofy print.
NEUT5|So I mean as far as practicality, yeah, the price didn't technically really go up there, so I'm just going to ignore that level and treat this more like you know the price was actually down here around the 137 mark, but that doesn't take away from the fact that especially when you consider that just a couple of days ago.
NEUT6|The price was all the way down here at 128 and other things all the way up here and the 1:37.
BULL7|So I mean definitely, definitely a very impressive move.
NEUT8|Over the past couple of days and updates.
NEUT9|Certainly need to be made in fact, so much so that I'm just going to get rid of both of those lines.
NEUT10|Sure, those levels pertain, but for, you know from a presentation standpoint where I step, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines area look, so let's try to keep this as clean as possible and focus on more so than the more relevant areas.
NEUT11|So one of the newest areas of support after today would call the ideal level.
NEUT12|We say you know what?
BULL13|Make this chart look the absolute best now going forward.
NEUT14|That would now be if the price can say above 135.
NEUT15|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 135.
NEUT16|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL17|That would certainly be an absolutely fantastic sign of power moving forward.
NEUT18|Taking a step back and looking at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT19|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT20|The 50.
NEUT21|Simple moving average keyword definitely moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move, that right there are being defined as.
NEUT22|The move just watch that Purple line.
NEUT23|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT24|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT25|Yeah, staying above 135 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance.
BULL26|Gotta squeeze things down here a bit.
NEUT27|Next, key battleground to watch very closely going to be right up here at one 3750.
NEUT28|So 137 fifty first key battleground and then after the one 3750.
NEUT29|Next, key level right up there at one 3875 in which the way Apple is going.
NEUT30|Who knows, maybe the price will be up at those levels just on Friday, but we have to see what happens with the But very impressive movement.
NEUT31|It'll be interesting to see how this one closes out the week on Friday 1st off.
BULL32|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL35|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
