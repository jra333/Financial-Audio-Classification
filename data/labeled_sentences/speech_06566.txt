NEUT0|"""Welcome back, we want to dig a little bit deeper into the big headline of the past hour and that of course, is that Jeff Bezos."
NEUT1|He's stepping down as CEO.
NEUT2|He's going to become executive chairman of Amazon.
NEUT3|Andy Jassy will be replacing Jeff Bezos.
NEUT4|We want to bring in Dan Hally for his reaction to all this.
NEUT5|And then this is something that Adam and I talked about earlier in the hour, but the one thing that stands out to me is this stock reaction.
BULL6|You would think that shares would be under pressure, yet shares are actually higher on the heels of this news.
NEUT7|Yeah, I think Brian Sozzi actually pointed this out earlier, but Andy is obviously someone who's better.
NEUT8|The company for some time and the big driver for Amazon is a WS.
BULL9|Amazon's web services and he helped get that off the ground and has been steering it to the growth that it's managed to reach.
NEUT10|It's the number one cloud provider in the world at this point.
NEUT11|Public cloud provider.
BULL12|So I think people look at that and they realized that a WS has much higher margin than the actual retail.
NEUT13|Site that Amazon operates.
BULL14|It's been the driver and so they're happy with that decision.
NEUT15|I think, you know, Bezos was is still going to be around.
BULL16|It's not like he's completely disappearing, but he's taking a step back and I think the fact that we're having or the company is going to have a new leader who has proven to operate well and managed to put a business like a WS out there and ensure that it's able to operate so well.
BULL17|I think investors are reacting positively to that.
NEUT18|Dan, in your tech journeys.
NEUT19|Have you ever met him?
NEUT20|Or at least I mean?
NEUT21|What kinds of things have you heard him say that you know, make your eyes open up what?
NEUT22|I I haven't had the pleasure of meeting him yet.
NEUT23|Hopefully that will change in his new role, but I think you know.
NEUT24|Obviously the big to do being that Amazon was able to basically take this service and make it a must have for so many different companies and as a result, we've seen other firms like Microsoft like Google like I mean older firms as well.
NEUT25|IBM, the Cisco, all of these different companies recognizing the power.
NEUT26|Of cloud computing as a result of Amazon really pushing it and recognizing that they need to get out there and have their own versions.
NEUT27|And so I think that that really is the big driver here.
BULL28|Now, at knowing that Andy is going to be taking this spot, it really will be an important turning point for Amazon.
BULL29|But it could also help the company innovate in different ways.
NEUT30|The fact that this was something that didn't exist and he was able to help push this into motion mean.
NEUT31|"Who knows what we'll see now."""
