NEUT0|"""Is skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|We are at #14 Monero erotica, XMR, it's 28th of October 2020 Wednesday at the day of the week for Monero.
BULL2|Against busy last week, we're saying that we're going to find some resistance at the noisy area, right?
BEAR3|There was a noisy area over here, and so we've identified it, and so we kind of hit the tip of the noisy area.
NEUT4|We didn't really break into it yet, and we hit the tip and we are seeing a retrace.
NEUT5|Small retrace.
NEUT6|How much snow we're going to retrace?
NEUT7|I have no idea.
BEAR8|I see a shooting star here due to another shooting star to are you going to drop much lower potentially if you see a mountain range here being formed Little boy, we could drop much, much lower for Monero against BTC.
BEAR9|So things are just not looking good for Monero at this point of time.
NEUT10|So I'd like to preach caution.
NEUT11|Yes, Monero has fundamental users.
NEUT12|Yes, because it is a privacy.
NEUT13|Coin is the largest privacy coin.
NEUT14|In the world.
NEUT15|Yes it is.
NEUT16|Yeah, I think I got it right, so it definitely hasn't use case because of the way that we are moving towards the future.
NEUT17|Everybody is going to be tracked because, you know, I can imagine if I were to fly to let's say for example.
NEUT18|NJM right now.
NEUT19|Very likely the government is going to want to know if I have taken the coronavirus vaccine or not, so there's going to be like a tracker kind of thing, either going to have to install.
BEAR20|And yeah, it is going to be very troublesome for awhile.
BEAR21|I think traveling is going to be very troublesome and so.
BEAR22|Cross Country traveling is going to be very troublesome even for right now.
BEAR23|If I wanted to leave the country, I have to take a test and I need to have a certificate before I land on another country and my God here it is very troublesome.
BULL24|So as things progress further and the tech catches up, I think eventually.
BULL25|Privacy is going to be an issue and so that is where Monero comes in right in the future, so I think that's why it is rising in value.
NEUT26|Maybe yeah, I'm not exactly sure, but yeah, there you go.
NEUT27|I see a few detention because you drop lower, right?
NEUT28|But I'm not exactly sure yet.
NEUT29|So yeah, it doesn't look like any tradeable shop then to me.
NEUT30|So be very, very careful about going to a trip to see.
NEUT31|Alright, let's move on to Monero against USD, but before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT32|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about Monero in the comments below for Monero against USD, we've been rising.
NEUT33|There's no clear bullish chart patterns and we continue to rise and rise and rise and rise and rise.
NEUT34|I can't, I can't count this is either 12345, yes?
NEUT35|Potentially I can't really count it, but there should be a retrace somewhere somewhere close by.
NEUT36|Somewhere over the rainbow's.
NEUT37|Bluebirds fly.
BEAR38|Said lyrics OK, I think I got it wrong.
BEAR39|Yeah, there's really a double bearish divergences higher high on the price, but a lower high on the lower high under RSI.
BEAR40|So potentially we could be seeing some sort of a reversal for Monero against USD.
NEUT41|Or we could still continue higher, right?
BEAR42|We saw a bearish divergent over here, right?
BEAR43|Higher high on the price, but lower than the lower high on the RSI.
BULL44|Yes, we did correct by eventually we continue rising higher, so I think the same thing could happen here.
NEUT45|We could correct.
NEUT46|You could continue higher, but I'm not entirely sure because there's just no tradeable shop items for Monero at this point of time, so be very careful about going to a trip to soon.
NEUT47|Alright, I guess you say from my Monero technical analysis.
BULL48|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL49|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT50|"I shall see you in the next video."""
