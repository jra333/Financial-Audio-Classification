NEUT0|"""Now the idea that your column lays out is that it is great."
NEUT1|It is empowering to have women make the first move on a dating app, but that might actually be market limiting.
NEUT2|How so?
BULL3|Hi Joe, thanks for having me.
NEUT4|Yeah, so the future of course is female and Bumble tells such a woke empowering story, but the bottom line is the vast majority of dating app users are men and that fact alone makes a platform like Bumble which is very female focus inherently market limiting.
NEUT5|Right and in a year, you know, actually the past year and another year starting where we're seeing some of these really anticipated IPO names go just gangbusters when they reach the public markets.
BULL6|You look at a bumble and what seems like really strong revenue growth of around 70% in 2019.
NEUT7|Now we have seen DoorDash and Airbnb.
NEUT8|Another surge on much lower rates of growth than that, but your column also argues that that actually isn't as good when you look at some of its peers.
BULL9|Right exactly so actually, I'll admit when I saw that 70% number and that's revenue growth in 2019 that was eye popping for me.
BULL10|But then when I compared it to Tinder for example, which is more popular with men, that company grew 138%.
NEUT11|So nearly double when you look at it at the age equivalent time.
BULL12|OK, so Laura great to have you.
NEUT13|It's John Fort.
BEAR14|This is going to be fun because I fundamentally disagree with your premise here.
NEUT15|And here's the beginning of why Android has more users than iOS.
BULL16|But Apple is the most valuable company in the world.
NEUT17|Apple made choices that are inherently market limiting, but they serve value and they have a premium.
NEUT18|And I think there's the potential, at least for Bumble to do exactly that if they super serve women.
NEUT19|Because I mean, you say.
NEUT20|Women don't want to be on the platform where the best women are.
NEUT21|They want to be on the platform where the best men are.
NEUT22|I disagree with that because if the best men are also on the platform with the worst men, I don't think women want to be there.
BULL23|OK thanks.
NEUT24|But look at it this way.
NEUT25|First of all, I think best is subjective, right?
NEUT26|Women want to be on the platform where the most men are an.
NEUT27|I don't want to be the person who comes out and says men are just totally not going to want to use bubble look.
NEUT28|I think there's some percentage in bend for which this could be a fantasy right?
NEUT29|Like upload a picture, put a swab note, send it out to the world, sit back, wait for women to contact you.
BEAR30|Some people are going to like that, but I think the vast majority of men it's going to be a tough sell.
NEUT31|Ask them to literally pay hopefully so the company can make money to go on a platform to get judged by women and.
NEUT32|Conceivably get approached by NASA.
NEUT33|I don't know.
NEUT34|I mean, we're being very gender normative in our language here, which I don't think is great.
NEUT35|So let me just put that out there, but I think you say the most men.
NEUT36|I've got some single friends who are women.
NEUT37|I think they would love to be on a platform with just 100 men if they were all great and there were no jerks, right?
NEUT38|I mean, and they would pay a premium for that experience.
NEUT39|Isn't that possible?
NEUT40|OK, but what percentage of men out there are all jerks, right?
NEUT41|OK, you're assuming that the mean you're going to go into Bumble are all wonderful men and that would be great if that were the case.
NEUT42|But also if you have millions of women on Bumble going after 100 men, that means that millions of women are inherently not going to sign any man on Bumble.
