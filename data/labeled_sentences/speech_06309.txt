NEUT0|"""Alright guys, this is Paul saying the market speculator with the Bulls on Wall Street stock of the week and this week the stock of the week is none other than Netflix."
BEAR1|Everybody's been talking about Netflix ever since Thursday when it had this breakout earnings reaction here.
BULL2|Huge move, jump from 475 all the way up to a high of 571.
NEUT3|So almost 100 points.
BEAR4|Looking really good here and generally Netflix has been a good trade post earnings and if we see last earnings here we see this big gap up here.
BULL5|This earnings breakout was good for for a for a nice move here.
NEUT6|Pull back so they've been multiple entries in here and that's what we're going to look for.
NEUT7|Going forward with the current current earnings here a couple of ways to play this.
NEUT8|A couple of levels can be hard to game, so we need to manage our risk properly.
NEUT9|What we're going to look for first is a pull back here to the bottom of the breakout bar an you know it's tough to predict when it would happen.
NEUT10|You know with the market the way it was on Friday for market starts to pull back.
NEUT11|We could get it really quick here, whereas last quarter it actually took a couple of months here to get that entry level at it.
NEUT12|Back to the bottom of the breakout bar.
NEUT13|But I am feeling, you know, depending on the market, but if we get that market pullback we could get it pretty quick.
NEUT14|Enter at the bottom of this breakout bar here.
NEUT15|Around 5:30 we're up at 571 right now, and what we want to do here is manage our risk closely.
NEUT16|You know, set that.
NEUT17|Stop below there.
BEAR18|If we get stopped out, we're going to be in this gap range here, and oftentimes once they get my gap range, they'll pull back down to the pre breakout area and then bounce.
NEUT19|So so those are the two key levels were going to look for.
NEUT20|You know, you know this pullback here we're calling it the stock.
NEUT21|Of the week, but it would most likely take longer to get to this level so you know this type of breakout.
NEUT22|We're watching this stock, you know, for weeks to months, but for the stock of the week, we're going to be looking for that to play at the first break.
NEUT23|Again, this post.
NEUT24|First pull back and again, if it breaks down here, we take a small loss.
NEUT25|No big deal, because if we do hit, you know we could get that.
NEUT26|Run up to 600 an if not, you know we take that loss and then we wait for that pull back.
NEUT27|To that gap filler range around will say 485, so that's it for the stock of the week.
NEUT28|It's Netflix.
