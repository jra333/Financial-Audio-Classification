NEUT0|"""Kevin, I listen I not gonna knock anybody in my industry."
NEUT1|You know, I heard some people talking last night about oh the the boycott.
NEUT2|Well let's forget the boycott wasn't in this that quarter.
NEUT3|The boycott is in this quarter it would have zero effect on the quarter that we just saw.
NEUT4|So I'll just jump ahead.
BEAR5|Are you worried that that could play havoc with this quarter?
NEUT6|Well, the answer is is not really.
NEUT7|We did get the disclosure around what the first few weeks of July have looked like.
NEUT8|That's plus 10% year on year.
NEUT9|The full 2 Q, which to your point was a massive blowout also plus 10%.
BEAR10|So despite you know, probably the worst macro backdrop in several decades despite comments around the brand boycott and what many people had feared was the largest advertisers in the world, perhaps leaving the platform for a period.
BULL11|We're still seeing double digit growth, and I mean.
NEUT12|Really, the quarter call we have this morning is if the question heading into the quarter and into the pandemic was the durability of social advertising in a challenge or slower growth environment?
NEUT13|Clearly we're in that right now.
NEUT14|You know, what would that look like?
BULL15|And Facebook delivered an absolute resounding confirmation that yes, it is durable.
BEAR16|Yes, it is defensible in a way that most investors, I think, underappreciated until until today and last night.
NEUT17|Yeah, and even this boycott which is this quarter, Kevin, you know I understand companies, they'll come out and saying, you know, we're pulling our ads from Facebook, but that doesn't mean that they're stopping using the back end advertising machinery that Facebook provides so well, does it?
NEUT18|It's it's.
NEUT19|They're two different businesses for Facebook and that that sort of back end mechanism.
BEAR20|From what I understand, is still ripping.
NEUT21|Well, I think the comment around you know being two separate businesses might might be a little bit off, but at the same time what what is clear is, you know Facebook moves product for marketers.
NEUT22|And if you're a marketer who's grown its business on Facebook, you're probably not in a position to say I'm going to stop my Facebook spend, I, I, you know, not to be too cynical about it.
NEUT23|But I think for many of the brands that that did come out with the boycott.
NEUT24|You know, some of that is PR for them.
BEAR25|You know, there's been enormous media coverage of the companies that have announced a boycott, so.
NEUT26|So some of that is is free media to them and you know, I think there's probably some some PR strategy and what we're seeing in the boycott as well.
NEUT27|Oh well, I little dark way to look at that very quickly there.
NEUT28|Then they added 4300 employees in the quarter.
BEAR29|Kevin, what I understand, their biggest quarterly hiring spree ever.
NEUT30|That does not say to me, a company that is afraid of the future.
NEUT31|Absolutely not.
NEUT32|I mean in terms of the the key growth initiatives, whether that be in sort of merging or converging with with E Commerce platforms by way of Facebook shops product by way of the things we're hearing about with the AR and VR development, you know all of the technical infrastructure that supports the entire business.
BULL33|"You know that growth remains, you know, very much on track, really, no deceleration from when we started the year and they do continue to invest for the future like you said."""
