BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|I'm back here with another video, and in today's video I'm going to be talking about draft Kings or dikhayengi.
NEUT2|This, I believe was my first ever video ever made on my YouTube channel.
NEUT3|It was about draft Kings and I did say that DraftKings will hit $55 by the end of the year.
BULL4|And it surpassed my target point.
BULL5|I hit a high of $64.75 and ever since then has been selling off massively.
BEAR6|From Ohio $64.75 it's now trading at $44.25, which is not good.
NEUT7|I believe it was over the weekend.
NEUT8|There was a news that came out.
BEAR9|The heavily impacted DraftKings.
BEAR10|I believe it was because there was many football games and just sports in general that were cancelled and it took a huge hit on DraftKings.
BEAR11|But I'm yeah, so it has been in a big big downtrend.
BEAR12|It did fall below my 200 ASM in line.
NEUT13|But if we look at the RSI is heavily heavily oversold, so here's my take on on DraftKings, right?
NEUT14|So it might take when I see the stock fan.
BULL15|Not tremendously.
NEUT16|I always wanna wait for the perfect time to buy.
NEUT17|We can see it's forming a little wedge if you connect.
BULL18|These are highs.
NEUT19|I mean the higher lows.
NEUT20|And these lower lows.
NEUT21|Uhm?
NEUT22|You do form a falling wedge.
NEUT23|So what I would like draft Kings to do is to break out of this wedge and somehow hopefully.
BULL24|It does find support around this $48.00 area.
BULL25|It does have support right down here on the $35 area, so I will be looking that and it has.
BULL26|Another support here around the $40 area.
BULL27|So right now it is looking for support.
NEUT28|I would like you to do is to break this wedge and then continue to be in an uptrend so we could have a nice setup for us right?
NEUT29|But other than that I will leave this talk alone so some positive catalyst comes out because right now Jeff Kings is taking a huge hit from the whole sports being cancelled and things like that.
NEUT30|So what I would recommend you guys to do is to a way for positive counters to come out that can lead us for draft Kings.
NEUT31|Take this wedge and then make a symmetrical triangle for us or any type of setup that we can find for DraftKings, but for now I would stay away from it unless that comes in because as we see the RSI it is extremely oversold so.
NEUT32|If it continues to fall.
BEAR33|All we can do really is to wait to see how happened because all we know is that draft Kings is in a downward direction.
NEUT34|It's in a downtrend, so if you guys do want to consider replacing puts, you actually go ahead and do it, but I'm going to keep my money and just wait to see how it sets up for us, right?
NEUT35|I'm always going to look for a set up if there's no setup then there's no trade for me.
NEUT36|I'll just move on to another stock, but yeah.
NEUT37|That's how I play DraftKings.
NEUT38|So yeah, that's pretty much it for this video.
NEUT39|Please do, the light comes scribers.
BULL40|"You did enjoy this video and I am."""
