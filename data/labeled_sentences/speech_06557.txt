BULL0|"""Welcome back everyone."
NEUT1|It's Monday, November 11th.
NEUT2|I'm Christina, Bethany investment analyst and today will be looking at what's happening in the euro dollar market.
BEAR3|So zooming into the four hour chart, we can see a clear bearish double top formation with the top around one point 1174 and an already broken neck line around one point 1072, which suggests that a bearish trend may be in progress.
NEUT4|Potential cross between the 20 and the 200.
BULL5|Moving averages would also would also strengthen the case, looking down to the momentum.
BULL6|Caterers are very site, has been around.
BEAR7|It's 30 oversold mark for awhile and is now looking ready to exit that area.
BEAR8|And the past acoustics are also in the same situation.
BULL9|Being ready to leave the 20 oversold mark while the Mac D has been somewhat improving recently though as long as all these indicators are hold deep in the bearish territory, heavy odds for a meaningful rebound in the price or remain minimal not to eliminate the negative sentiment we need to see her rally above the 38.2%.
NEUT10|Another one point.
BULL11|1064 Harvey Public from 1.08 seventy 8 to one point 1174, and more importantly, importantly above the one point 1072 neckline and move that could initially take us up to last week's high of one point 1092, and then near the 23.6% bonus of one point.
BEAR12|1007 further up resistance around one point.
NEUT13|1140 could also come into focus.
NEUT14|On the flip side.
NEUT15|Now if selling interest resumes.
BEAR16|The 61.8 percent 21.09 ninety two is expected to act as immediate support ahead of the 1.09 sixty six level are pulling lower 1.09 fourth two and one point.
NEUT17|Oh 925 had strongly rejected Downside corrections back in August and September and therefore should be kept in mind as well.
BEAR18|If one point, oh 925 fails to hold, then we may see an extension tours the 0.09 or three.
NEUT19|Barrier.
NEUT20|Finally, about the bigger picture, how the market is in a range trading between one point 1174 and 1.08 seventy 8.
NEUT21|So only a violation of these boundaries is our is expected to change the neutral outlook accordingly.
NEUT22|So that's all from me.
NEUT23|Thank you for watching.
BULL24|"Have a great day."""
