BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome to another episode of Star Talk."
NEUT1|Just going to talk about Facebook real quick because there's been some news over the weekend about it so they are getting into the video conferencing industry.
NEUT2|Like right now they have somehow put their heads in there because the competition with Zoom stood out so much that they realize that they have to just, you know, put forward and just like they realized they had the capacity to be more than they realized what the market is and with this virus they benefited from it.
NEUT3|They made the service, they and they're pushing it out there they're having.
NEUT4|Conference calls up to 50 people I believe, and they're going to do nothing more than push this further to like being an actual business platform possible for actual work.
BULL5|So with that being said, it wasn't until just after 2:00 PM that they started pushing up on Friday and I believe they still have room for growth.
BEAR6|I don't think the markets closed early enough on them where it froze it.
BULL7|I think it's still going to climb.
NEUT8|Probably another $20.
NEUT9|Just because like I said, this is a whole new industry to a degree that there pushing and we all saw how zooms stock climbed when they were showing how prominent they can be.
NEUT10|During this Facebook is about to do just the same thing and we're about to see it turn an even if it's not 30, we're about to see it rise $10 minimum.
NEUT11|So if you have the money to put towards it, go ahead, put it towards it.
NEUT12|Alright guys, hit that sub at the notifications.
NEUT13|"I'll see you around."""
