NEUT0|"""What's up, you guys welcome back to business buzz?"
NEUT1|Where we focus on business entrepreneurship and investing today.
NEUT2|I'm going to be talking about the recent Netflix News.
NEUT3|Why their stock is down in real life or see in the future for Netflix before we get into it makes you guys go down and leave a like down below to support our channel and let's get right into it.
BEAR4|Netflix has recently recorded its first subscriber loss in the USA.
BEAR5|This is significant because it means that more people quit their Netflix subscriptions.
NEUT6|Then people creating them this last quarter.
BULL7|This is a really big hit for Netflix, considering that the USA is their biggest market share.
BEAR8|However, it is important to keep in mind that they did gain over 2.7 million worldwide customers in the same quarter due to this big news Netflix dropped over 10% in after hours trading.
NEUT9|So your first question might be why did they even lose subscribers in the 1st place?
NEUT10|That's why I'm going to number one.
NEUT11|Alot of this may have to do with Netflix's recent price hike.
BEAR12|They went from a 1099 subscription to a 1299 subscription and that's a quarter where they lost all their subscribers.
BEAR13|Netflix is standing behind this as the reason that they lost so many subscribers.
BEAR14|#2 Netflix is losing content you may have heard lately that your favorite show on Netflix isn't going to be on there too much longer, and they're just losing good shows and programs left and right, which is why they're having to rely more and more on their own original shows produced by Netflix, for example.
NEUT15|Two of Netflix's most popular shows ever.
NEUT16|The Office and Parks and Recreation.
NEUT17|Or being taken off.
NEUT18|God.
NEUT19|No God please no no no.
NEUT20|No, an as an investor in Netflix, you might be thinking.
BULL21|Well, maybe this is good for Netflix.
NEUT22|Maybe then making their own original content might actually be a good thing for the future.
BEAR23|The only problem there is that Rotten Tomatoes has actually shown that Netflix original produce shows and movies actually get pretty low ratings on average, usually below 50%.
BEAR24|The final reason they may be losing subscribers is due to heavy competition streaming websites like Amazon Prime, HBO, and Hulu.
NEUT25|Or some of Netflix is current biggest competitors.
NEUT26|There's also a new one coming out called Disney Plus, which is going to be another huge competitor for Netflix.
NEUT27|Now let's delve into my opinions on the future of Netflix's stock.
BEAR28|Basically Netflix is trapped.
BEAR29|They are really over saturated in the market right now and they need to up their prices.
BEAR30|But obviously you saw what up in the prices did to some of their subscribers, so they're kind of in a rut right now.
NEUT31|It's also important to consider the Netflix is P ratio.
NEUT32|Is a whopping 125, which is really high in not great for a company like Netflix comparatively disease P ratio is 15 and with them about to come out with Disney.
BULL33|Plus it's not looking too good for Netflix.
NEUT34|Also Netflix is business model as a whole is pretty controversial.
BEAR35|Their debt to equity ratio is a bad 1.8 and they burn through over 3 1/2 billion dollars in 2018.
NEUT36|So long term wise we don't really see Netflix doing too well.
NEUT37|But who knows?
NEUT38|You just gotta do your own due diligence.
NEUT39|Find out if it's a company you want to invest in or stay away from.
