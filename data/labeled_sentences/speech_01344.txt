BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to stocks with Superman dude."
NEUT1|Oh yeah.
NEUT2|We got video OS.
NEUT3|Oh my God Video 12 right Yep.
NEUT4|Video #12 stock #12.
NEUT5|I think I messed up I'm I'm the last one but this is number 12 of 100 going through the 100 most popular stocks and rating them on a zero to 10 scale using nine major factors.
NEUT6|Don't forget of course as always to like and subscribe.
NEUT7|Let's first get into it this stat the next talk we got here is Bank of America.
NEUT8|BACS is the stock symbol first of all, taking a look at what do they do?
NEUT9|There a big bank.
NEUT10|It's a brick and mortar bank.
NEUT11|They have also their online stuff, but it's one of the most popular banks in the country.
NEUT12|It's also from what I see the chosen bank for unemployment and for the government.
NEUT13|So that's.
NEUT14|Something to be known, you know something to keep note of.
NEUT15|Bank of America now looking at the growth possibilities, growth estimates.
BULL16|We're looking over the next five years to earn about 23% per year.
BULL17|We saw excuse me last five years we saw about 23% increase over the next five years are expected to only increase about 1% per year.
NEUT18|Next year, 16% current year 30%.
NEUT19|Next quarter 73.
BULL20|These are positive numbers.
NEUT21|This one's a little rough, but I like what I see here.
NEUT22|Price target current 3731 average 3681.
NEUT23|So they're saying it's a whole Dora Ascentia Lee hold at these price next we're going to look at.
NEUT24|I gotta move my finger here PE ratio.
NEUT25|We did price target P ratio is 19.95.
BULL26|That's good.
BEAR27|We like to see that short interest on Bank of America has gone down 2%.
NEUT28|In the beta, let's look at the beta 1.55.
NEUT29|That's not bad at all.
NEUT30|Let's take a look at the chart here.
NEUT31|Recently, over the last several years, let's take a look at about 10 years worth.
BULL32|We've seen a nice upward trend taking a look a little shorter here.
BEAR33|It's recently just been running up.
BEAR34|It looks a little high and a lot of aspects on the chart things tend to correct.
BULL35|Of course, we may expect that, but it's also in my opinion, one of the best banks in the country.
NEUT36|So there's your stock chart.
BEAR37|This one is going to be a tough one.
NEUT38|Great, I like it, but I don't like the chart right now, so I'm going to give it a Bank of America.
NEUT39|I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 right now.
NEUT40|I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 even though I liked a lot of the stuff I see.
NEUT41|I think I'd like to see it come down a bit here.
NEUT42|All right, next one we're looking at is BB will see you then.
BULL43|"Thanks for watching and I hope you enjoy these videos."""
