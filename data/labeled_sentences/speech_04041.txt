NEUT0|"""What does this deal represent and what do you see?"
NEUT1|Customers in life Sciences demanding?
BULL2|OK, this deal is all about our partnership with the Cleveland Clinic to show how these technologies hybrid cloud artificial intelligence, high performance computing in the near term can all bring great benefits to health care.
BULL3|As we all know, I think over 19 and John has shown us that science can really help bend the curve and the advancements.
NEUT4|For example, in the vaccine have shown what computation applied to science can get done.
NEUT5|So using these technologies of artificial intelligence cloud.
NEUT6|And and high performance computing.
NEUT7|We definitely hope that what used to take 10 years can be done in one year and what used to take hundreds of millions of dollars can be done with perhaps one to 10 million.
NEUT8|And these advances then, which we work on together with the Cleveland Clinic.
NEUT9|We do the computation and the computer science.
NEUT10|They do, the medicine we hope to take those learnings and go into other clients and be able to apply those.
NEUT11|That's that's the whole goal here John.
NEUT12|And that's what we believe we're going to get done.
BULL13|Doctor Maravich the partnership overall with IBM, has been long long term.
BULL14|You have been working together for a long time.
NEUT15|Talk to me about Watson and what you learn from that.
NEUT16|The degree to which you're still using it and how that plays into this new phase of partnership.
NEUT17|We have a longstanding partnership with IBM that is true, a number of different levels.
BULL18|They are trusted partner when it comes to our information infrastructure.
BULL19|Across the entire Cleveland Clinic, both here in the United States and abroad, we partnered in initial phases with Watson and there were many, many learning experiences.
NEUT20|From from using Watson.
NEUT21|But this isn't a completely different than a separate deal.
NEUT22|We're naming it Discovery Accelerator, as in Arvind appropriately described it.
NEUT23|But we're going to be using is a high performance computing cloud infrastructure, AI, knowledge that.
BULL24|IBM will bring in partnership over Cleveland Clinic so that we can aggregate, analyze and put the data.
NEUT25|Did we?
BULL26|We'll see as important here and in clinical research so we can advance the medical field in healthcare in general faster.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
