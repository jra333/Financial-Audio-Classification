NEUT0|"""Age play in this via video chart on ticker symbol TL GT."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first area of support is what I would call the ideal of a weekly one.
NEUT8|Make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward and that will be the price.
BULL9|Could say up above $0.68.
NEUT10|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 68.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL12|We have the price could manage stay above that level.
BULL13|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword definitely moving understand the prices way.
NEUT18|A pair of that line is way down there, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move, that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health the Bulls run.
NEUT20|Oil control rings visualize that that is what has been being represented again.
NEUT21|Sure, stand up 68 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT22|Main battleground to watch all about that pink line up there, that 200.
NEUT23|Moving average you can see it's already rejected the price couple of times their rejected it right there.
NEUT24|Current value of that.
NEUT25|Is at $0.75, so keep a close eye on that moving forward as that main battleground.
NEUT26|But All in all, any angle you look at it, great movement today, great volume and not just the question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward, let's see what happens.

NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL30|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
