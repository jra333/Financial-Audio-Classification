BEAR0|"""The dramatic fall in the Chinese stock market last week immediately pushed down prices of almost all commodities, especially those most tides of the country such as copper, which had a new six year low."
BULL1|When the government stepped in to rescue stocks, engineering a rebound prices came right back up.
NEUT2|Interesting, Lee, this wasn't so much to do with fears that the stock market was suddenly affect real demand in China.
NEUT3|The world's largest consumer of most commodities.
NEUT4|Instead, what is happening is that traders within China are increasingly influencing global prices.
NEUT5|This is a big change from the past when trying to dictate a global commodity prices only via economic data will buy its growth rate and how much it consumed.
BEAR6|What we saw last week was that as the stock market tumbled volumes in copper futures contracts in Shanghai rocked it up and doubled in the space of a few days to record levels that was driven by funds scrambling to make equity.
NEUT7|Margin calls cover positions or put on new bearish bets to take advantage of the turmoil.
NEUT8|In the larger picture, this means that global commodity prices could increasingly be dictated from China.
NEUT9|The fact the commodity and metals prices followed the Chinese stock market back up in a move engineered by the government shows how much control they now have.
NEUT10|Of course, it is fair that the world's largest consumer and producer of many metals and other commodities should have a greater say in global pricing of products they mostly consume.
BEAR11|"But what we found out this week is that that has happened maybe quicker than they wanted and perhaps not in the way they intended."""
