NEUT0|"""Hi guys, how you guys doing back end of the video it is your boy will today will be talking about Disney ticker symbol DIS and will be going over some key support levels and resistance levels and I have been getting a lot of requests for Patreon and how it works."
NEUT1|So I'm gonna do your prime example today 'cause today I sent out an alert on my Patreon about Disney before this run up.
NEUT2|I told them my Patreon people to watch it an hour before market opened.
NEUT3|An also gave them in place and we ran up.
NEUT4|Then we exit out.
NEUT5|Here I'll show you that in a minute.
NEUT6|But for Disney.
NEUT7|I'll give you awesome levels to watch.
NEUT8|Or move this.
NEUT9|This.
NEUT10|For me to still be bullish on Disney, I wanted to hold.
NEUT11|Above 180.2.
NEUT12|Like right here.
NEUT13|Will make this blue so you don't just support.
BULL14|OK, so we wanted to hold above this level tomorrow and if it does hold above like we want something like this, the bounce off and then go up OK.
NEUT15|If it does get something like this that we can get in on a quick call option, a quick scout maybe like a 20 minute play on Disney tomorrow as we might see higher prices on Disney, but if it falls below this line this is my last defense to still stay bullish on the stock tomorrow.
NEUT16|But if it falls below that line.
NEUT17|Then I would not be playing Disney, I'll just wait for next week.
BEAR18|'cause again this is a short week.
NEUT19|Tomorrow is the last day of trading this week.
NEUT20|So have these key support levels on your chart.
NEUT21|This support level is 180.21 and this one is 179.45 and like for my Patreon, let me zoom in.
NEUT22|OK, this is a 15 minute chart by the way, so this candle is 8:35 to 8:45 and this candle starts at 8:45.
NEUT23|As you can see.
NEUT24|OK, so right here as you can see 747 hour before market open I sent out this notification so start watching Disney's Disney stock potential play.
NEUT25|This thing has had to support at the ones that are sent for three level that had that.
NEUT26|I have previously said in a video before, so looking for a nice play.
NEUT27|We might see higher prices right?
NEUT28|This is an hour before market, even openness then.
NEUT29|I sent this out at 8:41 AM.
NEUT30|When that move will start in I told them the strike price, how much I bought it for, how many I bought and also what I sold them for.
NEUT31|So this was a quick $300 play.
BULL32|My Patreon people would they sent me thank yous and stuff which I appreciate.
NEUT33|I like seeing that like seeing you guys make money.
NEUT34|But that is how I start sending out alerts and you can catch them plays early.
NEUT35|So.
NEUT36|Back to this.
NEUT37|Like I said, it was.
NEUT38|I sent alert at 841 so I sent the alert and this candle right here.
NEUT39|I sent the first solar before market.
NEUT40|I sent the 2nd right here.
NEUT41|We ran up and then we sold out right at the top for a quick profit game.
NEUT42|So that is the Disney that you can look out for tomorrow and also how my Patreon for the alerts work.
NEUT43|So make sure you guys check that out.
NEUT44|'cause I'm only accepting a certain number of people so hope you guys like this video.
NEUT45|Remember is not a recommendation of our so anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT46|"So do not try anything you see or hear in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
