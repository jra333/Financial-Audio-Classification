NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Dan Charles with simpletrades.net."
NEUT1|It is Wednesday June 12th and I'm looking at the stock Fox.
NEUT2|That's the Fox News Corporation, so the scanner got 600 stocks in this right now, and it's going through my indicators.
NEUT3|It scanned this list of 600 stocks in 4 minutes.
NEUT4|And told me to look at Fox.
NEUT5|These green first up two green plus and bull.
NEUT6|Those are things you will learn once you sign up to use the scanner, and once you learn those, you're going to be able to pick stocks at a high level like this one.
NEUT7|So what we're going to do is we're going to see.
NEUT8|Where this stock goes in the coming?
BULL9|One to three days will check back because everything is telling me this is bottomed out and it's going to break out alright.
NEUT10|Will check in in a day or two or three.
NEUT11|OK, it's a few days later and we're looking at Fox.
BEAR12|So on the 12th this looked to me like it was bottomed out.
BULL13|And I thought it was going to go up and it definitely did do that.
NEUT14|So I got out of this one today.
BEAR15|It looked like there might be resistance at 36.
BEAR16|Plus, my overextended indicators have been popping.
BULL17|An I'm in I'm into a lot of other trades right now, so I was very happy with the profit on this.
NEUT18|This little move.
NEUT19|I do think this could go higher, but I'm a short term trader.
NEUT20|Definitely looking at the monthly in the weekly there's this.
NEUT21|Could definitely go.
NEUT22|Go higher, but I'm out of it with the profit I move on I get in, I get out, move on.
NEUT23|So that's that.
