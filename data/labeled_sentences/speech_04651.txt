NEUT0|"""Matt Maurer wrote David and fools."
NEUT1|My question is this.
BEAR2|Are buybacks counterproductive to the market at large when many companies are doing them?
BEAR3|I often hear the 17 price to earnings ratio cited as an average, and when that average creeps above 17 to 19, pundits point to that indication saying it's an expensive market.
NEUT4|Expensive market Mac goes on to write, in turn, becomes fodder for all of the top colors.
BEAR5|The fear mongers seems like most repurchase plans are poorly executed.
NEUT6|ETC.
BULL7|Matts note very understandable.
NEUT8|Very good question.
NEUT9|So yeah, let's be clear on this.
NEUT10|Companies can buy back their stock.
NEUT11|It happens all the time.
NEUT12|Just like you can buy a stock.
NEUT13|Or you can sell.
NEUT14|These companies do that with their own stock and a lot of companies sometimes fall in love with their own stock.
NEUT15|They purchased their stock at the top.
NEUT16|They make all the mistakes that you and I might make and do sometimes make as investors.
NEUT17|A lot of companies are buying back shares merely to retire shares that they're going to be giving to their employees.
NEUT18|And others do it as a matter of a more efficient use of capital.
NEUT19|For example, if you are a slower growth, more mature company and you have a ton of cash, 'cause you're making a lot of cash flow.
NEUT20|But you can't reinvest that in your own business at a good enough rate of return, maybe your business just isn't growing that fast.
NEUT21|Instead, you can buy back shares, and when you buy back shares, if you and I are shareholders in the company, is buying back their shares, it's reducing the number of shares, right?
NEUT22|So when the company reports earnings per share?
NEUT23|All of a sudden that goes up right?
BULL24|'cause there are fewer shares and so the EPS or earnings per share of that company is higher and that will cause the stock usually do to do better.
BULL25|Thanks to a good trading multiple off of that rising earnings per share.
NEUT26|So companies are doing it they could.
NEUT27|They could have paid dividends with that money they could have reinvested in their business, but some companies just buy back shares.
NEUT28|So overall Matt, my view of this is it's a perfectly fair use of capital when done properly.
NEUT29|The two key conditions we're looking for here are.
NEUT30|Number one, if companies are egregiously giving away lots of options and shares to employees, this is a way just to keep things under control.
NEUT31|By buying back shares in the open market.
NEUT32|But #2, especially if it's a more mature companies I just mentioned it's an OK way to use capital, assuming that the management team is making good decisions on when to buy and sell stock, you and I can see.
NEUT33|What this kind of activity looks like?
NEUT34|For example, I just saw the earnings report for Texas Roadhouse, a Motley Fool stock advisor pick this week, and the company listed the number of shares it had bought in the market over the last quarter and paid.
NEUT35|I did the math about $35, about 35 and a half for those shares the stock as I do.
NEUT36|The podcast is about 41, so I guess you and I would say that was smart, right?
NEUT37|The company bought low and the current share price is higher today, but of course that's a short term measure, but I want you to know that I don't use buybacks overall, as a big indicator of where the market is headed.
NEUT38|There's no magic price to earnings ratio.
NEUT39|I'm foreshadowing a later mailbag item.
NEUT40|Will be speaking to, but there's no magic price to earnings ratio that I'm looking for to see when companies do the most kinds of buybacks.
NEUT41|I do think it could be interesting if you have a overall market view of the number of buybacks, and you have a historical appreciation for that.
NEUT42|I think that can be fruitful, not part of my own approach, but I think it's I think it's legit.
BULL43|Thanks for good question.
NEUT44|As always, people on this program may have interest in the stocks they talk about, and The Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for.
NEUT45|Or against so don't buy or sell stocks based solely on what you hear.
