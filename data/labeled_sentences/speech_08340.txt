BULL0|"""Well, good morning traders."
NEUT1|My name is Mark and today we're looking at workhorse.
BULL2|Well yesterday was intensive.
BEAR3|In premarket trading we actually broke above this continuing resistance line.
BEAR4|And since then, we haven't turned back and it looks like this morning were gapping up again quite considerably considering we closed at around 1780 and we're currently looking at opening at 1920.
NEUT5|This guy is running and if I had to look at any type of like a price target for the short term, I would look at around 21.
NEUT6|So from its current spot you're looking at roughly a $2.00 move.
NEUT7|As of right now.
BULL8|But yeah, we we definitely took off yesterday.
NEUT9|Basically if you.
NEUT10|When we looked at the when the market opened basically came down and did basically a what's called a back test of this resistance line slash support and once we did that.
NEUT11|Troy ran up, that's that's traditional, but I've seen a lot of stocks is that you'll have some type of just to verify.
NEUT12|Hey, you know we did break through the support and then at that point that's when you start going.
NEUT13|A lot of speculative plays out are moving in this general direction.
NEUT14|Neo is just continuing to run.
NEUT15|In terms of risk tolerance, you know it's.
NEUT16|It's up to you what you wanna do.
NEUT17|I mean, if I was looking at some form of pullback within this before it came back up.
NEUT18|I mean, you may get it work to run.
NEUT19|This guy, like in the morning you got some form of pullback.
NEUT20|So if I was going to look at trying to get into this stock, you know maybe.
NEUT21|I mean, you could potentially argue 1880 ISH, maybe 1885 really.
NEUT22|You could potentially.
NEUT23|For lower you know 1840.
NEUT24|Or I could come all the way down here to test this.
NEUT25|I'm at 18 even.
NEUT26|Yeah, that's this.
BEAR27|And a lot of other plays right now are all gapping up and I think the whole overall markets gapping up.
NEUT28|Just a lot of people think that the election is not going to be.
NEUT29|Like it should be ended by the week.
NEUT30|We'll see what happens.
BULL31|Definitely markets moving in a direction.
BULL32|You guys have a good one.
NEUT33|"Let me know what you think."""
