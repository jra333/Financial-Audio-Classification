BULL0|"""Hello guys, welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|So today we were kind of looking at Artel so I tell basically had.
BULL2|Pretty good day today.
NEUT3|It had a huge volume.
BULL4|And it went to a high of.
NEUT5|367 and then can I dropped off.
NEUT6|This may actually continue tomorrow because the last time it kind of went over.
NEUT7|There was on really no volume.
NEUT8|You kind of had that kind of a spike and then it kind of came back all the way down, but this time it actually seemed to have held that level and the volume seem to be actually picking up on this one.
NEUT9|So.
NEUT10|Let's see where it actually.
NEUT11|The best candles.
NEUT12|So it kind of opened at the at this low here, which is around a dollar and 17.
NEUT13|Wait, am I looking at a week?
BEAR14|Yes, I'm looking at a week so that's gonna mess it up.
NEUT15|OK so if we looked at the dailies?
BEAR16|Then yeah, we did go to $3.67 at the high of the day, but still it kind of shows up as a red candle because it closed at a price which is lower than what it opened at.
BEAR17|So it opened at around $2.88 and it does have like an inverted hammer, which is actually a bearish signal.
BEAR18|So this might actually fall and trade down.
NEUT19|That's what I'm gonna expecting from it.
NEUT20|Based on this scandal set up, but it did kind of try to it did break about the $3 level, but it couldn't go over three, 89438 and 6:32.
NEUT21|So let's see how this kind of trades going into Tuesday because Monday is a holiday.
NEUT22|So let's see if it can take support at this level, and then maybe bounce back up here.
NEUT23|So that's all I had for Artel.
NEUT24|"So if you like this video then do like and subscribe to my channel, thanks."""
