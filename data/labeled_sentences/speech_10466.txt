NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take the Apple stock we can see here today it got another red candle after the gap down here to read can already so here the dodgy means, indecision and hit."
NEUT1|This third year my life.
BEAR2|But today it has dropped down again.
BEAR3|So this Skype shows the very bearish sentiment in the market.
BEAR4|Here is already formed a death cross so it's very bearish for Apple stock in short term.
BEAR5|In midterm vacancy we already got a frying pan, top nearly short term, so it's very likely to drop down back again.
BULL6|"So thank you."""
