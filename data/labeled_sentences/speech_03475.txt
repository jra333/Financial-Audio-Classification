NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead."
BEAR1|America's small businesses badly need help, but Washington is not doing nearly enough.
NEUT2|Yes, Congress may put another $250 billion into the Paycheck Protection Program, but that is not enough.
NEUT3|The Federal Reserve has what it calls the main streak expanded facility program that's supposed to provide $600 billion.
BEAR4|For small and mid sized businesses, but incredibly, the Fed has been dragging its feet.
NEUT5|It's still not up and running probably won't be up and running until May.
BEAR6|Even worse, the Treasury Department and the Fed have concocted very onerous conditions for businesses to get these loans.
NEUT7|President Trump should tell the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to stop this foot.
NEUT8|Dragging this bureaucratic foot dragging and get that money out.
NEUT9|Now the Fed reserve should tell small banks especially.
BEAR10|It will backstop every dollar of loans that makes the small businesses.
NEUT11|These small banks know who is creditworthy, who was good for these loans before the crisis?
NEUT12|Get that money out now.
BEAR13|That way we'll have a small business community that can be revived as the American economy opens up, but right now too much foot dragging businesses are going down.
NEUT14|Washington must get off.
NEUT15|It's tough right away.
NEUT16|Now Major League Baseball has come up with a plan coming this July of perhaps having the baseball season played in empty stadiums in Arizona.
NEUT17|That's ridiculous, you can play without a crowd with tennis golf, but not baseball.
NEUT18|Not to mention football, hockey, or basketball fans energized the game.
NEUT19|Here's what MLB should do.
NEUT20|What it should do is play baseball games in the regular stadiums before you can go in.
NEUT21|You'll have to have your temperature taken.
NEUT22|You'd have to wear mask, perhaps with the team logo gloves.
NEUT23|You'd have social distancing, perhaps half the stadium would be filled up.
NEUT24|You would have to sign a waiver of legal liability, but fans would be glad to put up with it.
NEUT25|Obviously the games would have to be played in the evening.
NEUT26|You wouldn't want to sit in the hot afternoon sun with those masks and those gloves.
NEUT27|All that can be worked out what the American people want is live action.
NEUT28|So use the stadiums around the country play ball.
NEUT29|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL30|Thank you so much for listening.
BULL31|"Looking forward to talking to you soon again."""
