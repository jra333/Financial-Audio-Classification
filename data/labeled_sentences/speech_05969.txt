NEUT0|"""Hey fools Brandon Matthews here, joined by Jason Moser and this is our ask a full segment."
NEUT1|We've got a great question that comes from business Brad on Twitter.
NEUT2|Brad ***.
NEUT3|I've been slowly adding stocks to My Portfolio but I'm still heavily weighted in 401K mutual funds.
NEUT4|Should I continue to buy stocks in order to diversify My Portfolio?
NEUT5|Jason, we talk about diversification a lot.
NEUT6|That's a common question.
NEUT7|What do you think in this situation?
NEUT8|Yeah, I mean from what it sounds like.
NEUT9|I mean, it sounds like it.
NEUT10|Sounds like business.
BULL11|Brad has a, you know, a well established position with some mutual funds in his 401K mutual funds are OK.
NEUT12|I mean we, I think we all own at least some here there with the retirement plan or whatever.
NEUT13|The thing that keep in mind that with mutual funds they typically are more costly.
NEUT14|You know they just they don't really out there very, very rarely outperform the market because of the frictional costs involved with high churn rates and always sort of turning those portfolios over.
BULL15|But still, by the same token, they're nice to have as part of a greater diversified portfolio.
NEUT16|So with that said, it sounds like he was looking to get into the direction of adding some more individual stocks in there to be able to sort of expand, grow that portfolio and I don't see any reason to stop doing that.
BULL17|I think that right now is a great time to just slowly, methodically add individual stocks in the portfolio, and I don't know if business Brad is a member of any or premium services, but you know, we have stock recommendations every month that come out, and I think they all make for excellent opportunities to continue to build out that diversified portfolio because you could be 2B2 overweight in mutual funds.
BEAR18|And really hurt yourself from a cost perspective, right?
NEUT19|So I think that I agree with everything you said.
NEUT20|I would just add a lot of it comes down to Brad's personal preferences.
NEUT21|So if Brad you're the kind of person who likes to pick individual stocks, you've shown some aptitude you don't mind putting in the time you don't mind following companies, then yeah, you could buy more stocks.
NEUT22|Potentially beat the market, know what you're buying, study businesses if you're the kind of person who just doesn't want to put in the time who just wants to set it and forget it, then I would say you should just stick to index.
NEUT23|Low cost index mutual funds.
NEUT24|Yeah, an even another opportunity out there might be to throw in like in like an S&P ETF or something like that where you could get exposure to that broad market of all 500 Holdings out there in the SNP while getting the best kind of cost structure.
NEUT25|Therefore we need to give you something that will at least match the markets returns out there without hitting you on the cost side, right?
BULL26|Thanks Jason.
