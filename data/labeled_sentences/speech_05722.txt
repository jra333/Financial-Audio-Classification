NEUT4|I guarantee you're going to find anyone else putting this kind of analysis out on a more frequent basis.
NEUT5|'cause I don't mind put my neck out there 'cause then it can alesys is just something we use as a tool to see where we possibly can get in and make a good swing trade.
BULL6|I'm so gas looking at Facebook has been a ****** couple days as we are all aware that we have with following here.
BULL7|Everything has touched out.
BEAR8|180 market has been falling ever since just due to some noise in the in the media.
NEUT9|So I like to trade what I see not what I hear.
BULL10|However the media is definitely got the investors running for the Hills currently.
BEAR11|So there was another Red Day and volume continues to increase as it goes down, which is not a good sign.
NEUT12|You want to see this kind of decreasing, just telling you the seller to drying up.
NEUT13|The only positive is this trend line we spoke about in last couple of videos.
NEUT14|Miss touched here and now has came down and touched here again and it moved up and closed about around that line.
BULL15|So that is a positive thing.
NEUT16|If you want to find any positives at all this old trend line here which is usually some type of support.
NEUT17|It didn't check up at all so I'm gonna go ahead and erase this now and these older lines of support and resistance.
BEAR18|They were held up yesterday, but then again it broke it this morning fell completely out of it.
NEUT19|So where are we going to go in the near future?
NEUT20|You like this line for definitely some kind of some type of bounce.
NEUT21|I don't know if it's going to happen tomorrow or not.
NEUT22|I could see tomorrow being more of a sideways day.
NEUT23|Same with Twitter.
NEUT24|Take part would be sad way to sit around 1:30.
NEUT25|Levels of support.
NEUT26|Really you have this area here and see how these candle sticks are so if you want to kind of put it in this ballpark.
NEUT27|There around 156.
NEUT28|Or if you want to go in further in that, let's see if I can't.
NEUT29|Just move it down here.
NEUT30|So you're looking at around 1:50 Ranger 151, so and if Venice StockTwits there has been some: 150 and I just did never.
NEUT31|I've never seen this coming, just for the fact that how strong a company Facebook is.
BEAR32|It just seems that a bunch of investors are spooked off now with decreasing users and plus Congress kind of stepping in.
NEUT33|And you know bringing some things to light.
NEUT34|About you know social media and the way they use your data.
NEUT35|So guys, let's look at the hourly savaging other telltale signs.
BEAR36|There's not, it just continues to bump up here against the nine YMA, and this continues to fall.
NEUT37|So it's about to get there again.
NEUT38|That's why I think it may open up bread more, but.
NEUT39|Hard to tell if you're in a long.
NEUT40|I'm not sure how you doing how you trade put on being a Facebook for a long time.
NEUT41|It could be a time to buy in an average down if you're looking to get into make quick swing.
NEUT42|Let's wait on some type of confirmation.
NEUT43|That is my advice.
NEUT44|'cause right now in doesn't seem to be inside but tomorrow could spell this thing.
NEUT45|Kind of sitting still and we can make it run back up to 170 or so.
NEUT46|So guys, if you are interested, follow along with Facebook.
