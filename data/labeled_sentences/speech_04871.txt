NEUT0|"""It it's interesting with the your your transition Kevin though, because like I definitely remember you a few years ago, you were definitely, you know all real estate train and you were definitely, you know, real estate better than stocks and it's interesting."
NEUT1|Now you're making this argument that stocks are better than real estate.
NEUT2|It's just funny to see kind of things.
NEUT3|Circle it's yeah and you're right.
NEUT4|It's where you are, though it with net worth it in my opinion.
NEUT5|If I have 5,000,000 in the markets and I make a 10% return, why am I going to leave my house?
NEUT6|That's 500 grand a year and I'm doing Jack nothing right?
NEUT7|Whereas if I have $10,000 and that's my net worth is $10,000 cash, let's say, am I going to use that $10,000 and try to go Yolo wallstreetbets stocks and maybe double, but then on the next one I lose half my money or more.
BEAR8|In half my money I lose 70% of my money, then I'm down.
NEUT9|Then I'm like, Oh my gosh, this was my life savings.
NEUT10|Or do I take that ten, $20,000?
NEUT11|Whatever it is, go buy a little fixer upper.
NEUT12|Now I control A3 or $400,000 house and I can create $100,000 of equity for sure rather than speculate with $10,000 stock portfolio.
NEUT13|And so I think that's where that transition came from is going from like me going from literally zero working at 9 bucks an hour at Robin Hood or Red Robin?
NEUT14|Working no issues.
NEUT15|You're paying your 9 bucks.
NEUT16|No wonder it has so many.
NEUT17|But I mean, you get the idea right like so you like going from that?
NEUT18|That was, that's what gave me my ability to invest in stocks is all the real estate.
NEUT19|Well, I don't know.
BEAR20|I owe so much to that, but now I'm looking at it like thanks, but I've kind of feel like in some sense I've kind of graduated that and it sounds horrible because I love it so much.
NEUT21|But no, that makes sense.
NEUT22|Literally all of us.
NEUT23|I feel like I've graduated from from something because of our circumstances, like with me, with dividends to focusing more on growth just because of YouTube to you doing more stocks to.
NEUT24|Graham, focusing also more on YouTube rather than real estate.
NEUT25|So kind of all have gone through this evolution process.
NEUT26|Uhm?
NEUT27|That's really all it is.
NEUT28|When I had all the free time in the world, I just loaded it up with real estate.
NEUT29|I was at those properties twice a day.
NEUT30|I remember I wake up early, go to the property, check it out, go to the office after six, after 7, go to the gym, go back to the property, see what they've done.
NEUT31|I did that for months, but and that's what it took to really do well at the beginning.
BEAR32|"But when you have no free time and your time is so valuable going and you know spending even 30 minutes, the car, that opportunity that you lose to do anything else that has a higher yield starts adding up."""
