NEUT0|"""Hi this is Samir from investexcel.net."
NEUT1|In this video, I'll demonstrate how you can get regularly updated dollar spot prices straight into Excel spreadsheets.
NEUT2|This technique uses excel's web query functionality.
NEUT3|I'll stop against the date tab.
NEUT4|And taking on from web.
NEUT5|This brings me to the new blood Prairie window.
NEUT6|In the address bar, I'll paste in the URL and click on go.
NEUT7|This brings me to this page from the Yahoo Finance websites.
NEUT8|This page lists gold spot prices.
NEUT9|In this table I have the previous close the open as well as the bid and ask prices.
NEUT10|If I click on this arrow on the top left corner of this table.
NEUT11|This table gets highlighted.
NEUT12|Online click on imports.
NEUT13|Excel now asks me where I want the date to be located in my spreadsheets.
NEUT14|Let's say I'll have it filled in himself, A1.
NEUT15|Let's click on properties.
NEUT16|I cannot edit the properties of that query.
NEUT17|This option lets me change the refresh rate of the web query.
NEUT18|Let's say I want this web query updated every minute.
NEUT19|I'll check on OK and OK again.
BULL20|Excel when connecting Yahoo Finance and brings him my gold spot prices.
NEUT21|As specified in the right query properties, this data will update every minute.
NEUT22|If I want to change the refresh rates, all I need to do is drag select this range of cells.
NEUT23|Right click.
NEUT24|And select data range properties.
NEUT25|And then go back to the Web Pro Properties menu.
BULL26|"Thank you for listening."""
