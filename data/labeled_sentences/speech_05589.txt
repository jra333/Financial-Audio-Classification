NEUT2|Is a freaking weekend?
NEUT3|Is a 50 every week.
NEUT4|So have yourself security cannot hear of you.
NEUT5|We are #5 polka dots with vertical dots was giving would what's up Robert Heber, Meyer, so for picking out against busy OK. That's one thing I notice, which I think is very scary, what I notice is steady.
NEUT6|There's a double bearish divergance in the charts right if you look at poker games BC.
BULL7|We have a higher high just marginally higher high.
BEAR8|However, on the main D it is a lower high on the RSI is a lower high.
BEAR9|This means that potentially there could be a reversal coming on.
NEUT10|There could be a correction, so you need to be very, very careful about going to a trade too soon.
BEAR11|No guarantees, we could still just spike out from here, but more likely than not, once you see weakness right in the median RSI more likely than not that there could be a correction coming on 4th, especially against BTC, so you need to be very, very careful about going to a trade too soon, right?
NEUT12|Normally you make moves.
NEUT13|When things are low and you sell it, when is high, right?
BEAR14|Right now things are very high, so I don't think it's a good idea to be making purchases.
NEUT15|So be very careful about going to a trade too soon, right?
NEUT16|Let's move on to put out against USD T, but before that please close video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about polka dot in the comments below for Dot against USD T we have in or near Rampage have been rising higher and higher and higher and higher.
NEUT17|And yeah it's just in the same brightness, just crazy insane where overbought we've been over before very long time and we continue to stay over but just because we are Overwatch.
NEUT18|Doesn't mean we are going to reverse.
NEUT19|We can stay overbought longer than you could expect and so from the very lows of every $1.00, about $2.00.
BULL20|We're up at $31 right now.
NEUT21|Do I see any bearish reversal?
NEUT22|Not at all.
NEUT23|Not today.
NEUT24|And not at this point of time, maybe.
NEUT25|Maybe in the next few days, maybe by the end of February, maybe by the end of March beginning of March.
NEUT26|I don't know.
NEUT27|I can't say for sure, but right now things are still looking pretty bullish for polka Dot bikini.
BULL28|And while things are remaining bullish, our bias remains bullish as well.
NEUT29|We will follow the trend.
BEAR30|Trend is showing bullishness.
NEUT31|We will remain bias bullish as the saying goes.
NEUT32|The trend is your friend and so there you go.
NEUT33|Is is that in terms of our tradability there just no clear tradeable patterns for polka dot at this point of time?
NEUT34|Not against BTC, not against USD.
NEUT35|So you need to be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT36|I'm not saying we're going higher, I'm just saying I can't really gauge how much higher we're going to go.
NEUT37|Maybe we might just go slightly higher right before we see a big correction come on, so you need to be very, very careful about going to a trick too soon.
NEUT38|Alright, I guess I see from my pocket out technical analysis.
BULL39|Thank you very much for watching.
