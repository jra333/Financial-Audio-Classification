NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol, an XSD."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a weekly one.
NEUT8|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT9|Can sample above $3 now.
NEUT10|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL12|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword.
BULL17|Definitely moving.
NEUT18|I get the price is way up there that lines way down there, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control period.
NEUT20|Visualize that that is what is being presented against your saying above.
BULL21|$3 would be great.
NEUT22|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|Let's actually just change this.
NEUT24|To the daily time frame here and as you can see from this point of view, I mean it has been quite literally years.
NEUT25|There we go since the price of an up this high.
NEUT26|So the next key area of resistance is going to be right up here at $3.85 an again that's coming from you know, back here and let's see what 2017 actually.
NEUT27|So yeah, Ben along time.
NEUT28|More of the story here though.
NEUT29|Monster volume today Monster Price movement, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT32|But it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
