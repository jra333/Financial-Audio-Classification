BULL0|"""In the former chief economist to Vice President Joe Biden joins us right now on where things stand and Jerrod, it's good to see you."
NEUT1|I love first to get your comments on this $432 million in cash on hand.
NEUT2|How far can that go in less than three weeks?
NEUT3|Well, you know when I think of millions and trillions, it's always from the perspective of an economic adviser.
NEUT4|And so I'm not in the in the in the room where those meetings are taking place.
NEUT5|I don't think that the president or vice president going to have any trouble making their closing argument here, which is really a very straightforward argument about, you know you could.
NEUT6|You could begin by asking the old Ronald Reagan question.
BEAR7|Are you better off than you were four years ago?
BEAR8|Not if you're one of the 10s of millions of unemployed, or the folks who've lost.
BULL9|Enhanced unemployed benefits.
BEAR10|Families facing hunger and eviction, or the farmers and the manufacturers or people with school age kids who've been hurt by the president's epic fail on both trade and and covid.
NEUT11|But there's an equally pressing question that's going to be pressed in these coming weeks, which is not just are you better off than you were four years ago, but can America survive four more years of Trump?
NEUT12|Ian, Economic and social chaos?
NEUT13|Not to mention encouragement.
NEUT14|2 white supremacism, purveyors of racial hatred, so there is a lot to be said in these last few weeks.
BEAR15|You Jerrod, there are so many public workers though that have pensions that are exposed to the stock market market.
BULL16|Certainly they have seen gains under President Trump and the White House as we heard from the Treasury Secretary this morning is trying to get a stimulus deal.
NEUT17|They are going uphill for this, but they've put $1.8 trillion on the table.
NEUT18|It's been rejected, and they're both progressive Democrats and moderate Democrats who are privately urging Speaker Pelosi to take this if.
NEUT19|Vice President Biden were president.
NEUT20|Would he tell Pelosi to take this deal?
NEUT21|Well, he's certainly not going to get into negotiating with the in between Fellowship Pelosi and Schumer and the White House.
NEUT22|I think the way to think about this from my perspective, and I suspect the campaigns as well, is that these folks are are closing in on a on a reasonable number in terms of the bottom line.
NEUT23|But really, what really matters a lot, and here Biden would definitely have had something to say about it is what's inside the bill?
NEUT24|What's inside the stimulus bill, and.
NEUT25|You know you will recall when he was the implementer in Chief of the Recovery Act.
NEUT26|Not only was he very focused on getting the the highest multiplier components in there, which in this case would be state and local fiscal relief.
NEUT27|Of course, the kinds of health measures that Pelosi is fighting hard for, and that I've heard today.
BEAR28|Maybe the White House is bending a little.
NEUT29|I mean, the idea that they're fighting back on that is kind of otherworldly to me, but also enhanced unemployment benefits, state and local.
NEUT30|Very important something that the Republicans have been down.
NEUT31|So you know I'm not going to second guess they negotiated with the skills of Nancy Pelosi, but I think right now with their arguing about is probably less bottom line and more composition.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
