BULL0|"""Good morning, welcome to Goodwill."
NEUT1|In this video presentation we will see how we can trade in nifty index features and options today.
NEUT2|Let us see what happened yesterday.
BEAR3|The market open somewhere near 14,600 right after the opening, there was some short buying that pushed the price towards 14,840 again.
BEAR4|The price found some resistance came down and tested 14,650.
NEUT5|Finally the price close near 14,760.
BULL6|So initially in yesterday's trading session we had some buying but finally the market form some resistance.
NEUT7|But today it's expected open Semenya 14,800 price opening is subjected to changes since we are recording.
NEUT8|And posting this video presentation much earlier.
NEUT9|So what does that mean?
NEUT10|If the price is opening near 14800 or so?
BULL11|If you see the yesterday's price action, the market form some support near 14,720 and 760 on the previous on on 1st of April.
NEUT12|Also the price form some support need 14,760 and we could constantly witness some sort of buying happening around 14760 since the price closed near footings around 60 and it is opening near 14,800.
BULL13|We can expect some sort of momentum on the buying side, so probably it can push the price towards the next next resistance.
NEUT14|So let us see what's going to happen during the training session.
NEUT15|You can go for buying till 14,760 by placing stupid 14,740, expecting the market to move up on how you can put that in the options market you can see that 14,800.
NEUT16|Maybe there are many option now so select but select foot in those 900 strike Call option which close around.
NEUT17|So maybe whatever price you get right over the opening, you can wait for the market to drop a bit and then you can go for by by placing some 2530 points Topper.
NEUT18|So let's see what's going to happen during the trading session.
