BULL0|"""Hi everyone, welcome back to another video."
BEAR1|In this video we are going to take a look at NEO stock and try to predict what will happen in the next couple of days now last day to stock went down 9% and that was huge and the reason why that happened was because they had their earnings results and they disappointed the analysts an they were below the expectations so they didn't deliver as many vehicles as people thought and they didn't make as much money as people thought so the stock just limited.
BEAR2|9% nine point 10% an during today it was down even to negative 15% and I was actually thinking about buying at that negative 15%.
NEUT3|An I didn't.
BULL4|I probably should have, but anyway move on and if you look at the graph this company has been growing a ton over the last couple of months an I do think this is a trend that will keep seeing an.
BEAR5|I definitely think that at the price that it is now after the stock being down 9%.
NEUT6|I definitely think this next trading day will be a great opportunity to write new stock if you are interested now in my opinion.
NEUT7|Do I think there are better options out there?
NEUT8|I definitely do.
NEUT9|I don't think Neo is one of the top five best stocks to buy right now.
BULL10|If I had to pick five to buy tomorrow, I definitely wouldn't pick this stock, but I definitely think that because of the sector that the stock is inserted in that it can have a lot of hype and it can definitely drive up the stock price.
NEUT11|So mostly by relatively new investors, an in general do I think this trend will keep.
BULL12|Going up, I definitely think so, and I definitely think that in a couple of months and in a couple of years, this stock will absolutely be way, way better than the S&P 500 and the market average.
BULL13|However, are there much better options out there that will give you a way bigger return and make you way more money?
BULL14|I definitely think so.
NEUT15|And even if you go take a look at the PR ratio, it's almost 120 so it's relatively overpriced.
NEUT16|Now.
NEUT17|Yes, Tesla is.
BEAR18|10 times more overpriced.
NEUT19|When you compare to PR ratio of 1 to the other.
NEUT20|However, this one is relatively overpriced for a company that doesn't have some sort of monopoly in an industry now, they do sell a lot of vehicles.
BEAR21|They do make a lot of money, but their numbers and their deliveries definitely didn't meet the expectations and the stock limited an.
BEAR22|Now it's probably a great time to buy if you are interested in buying now even with the stock being down 9%, I still think you have better options if you want to buy it.
NEUT23|Today or tomorrow, depending on when you are listening to this, but whenever the market opens, I definitely think you will have better options than this one.
BULL24|Will this go back up at least another 5% in a few days probably?
NEUT25|I think it almost definitely will, but do I think you have way better options out there.
NEUT26|I definitely think you do 0.
NEUT27|In my opinion, do I think you should buy this stock?
NEUT28|No, but if you are going to buy the stock anyways, then now it's a great time to do it.
NEUT29|So that was it for this video that was just a quick update on new stock.
