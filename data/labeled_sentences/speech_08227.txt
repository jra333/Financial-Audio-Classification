NEUT1|Better wait for the results of those Georgia Senate races.
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world.
BULL3|The stock market is booming.
BULL4|Markets are anticipating a good economy for 2021 as anti COVID-19 vaccines become more widely available and lockdowns are ended once and for all.
NEUT5|But investors should remember the title of a famous song called George.
BEAR6|On my mind the economy will face Savage headwinds if the Democrats win those two US Senate.
NEUT7|Phrases in Georgia coming January 5th.
NEUT8|Democrats would then control both houses of Congress.
NEUT9|There will be no holding back.
NEUT10|The radical agenda of the Democrat Party's far left.
BEAR11|And that would be bad news for the economy and for stocks.
BEAR12|For starters, Joe Biden will feel no hesitation in mandating mask wearing and imposing so-called targeted lockdowns, even though vaccines will be available, this will slow recovery, especially for small, battered businesses.
BULL13|The new president will be able to fill this promise.
BULL14|A big tax increases, including a 33% rise in business taxes, boosting the capital gains levy to a stock market, crushing 44% and hiking top income tax rates.
NEUT15|Middle class earners may not be immune as those extra taxes will not begin to pay for Biden.
BEAR16|Spending promises they will be squeezed as well.
NEUT17|Federal debt tax liabilities will go up for people of moderate means and this next administration will be eyeing ways to loot your 401K's and IR A's.
BEAR18|The Obama Biden government made disturbing noises about putting a lid on how much you'd be allowed to accumulate in these plans with Uncle Sam helping himself to part or all of the alleged overages.
NEUT19|There will be no restraints and more government control of health care which will lead to less medical care for everyone, particularly elderly health care.
BEAR20|Stocks will be hit hard financially.
BEAR21|Reckless states such as New York, California, New Jersey, Illinois or receive bailouts at the expense of more responsible state and local governments.
NEUT22|The White House will not have to worry about Senate confirmation of pro regulation and anti free market appointees to critical agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission.
NEUT23|When Obama and Biden were in office, the FCC was smothering the Internet with old style pre digital era rules.
BEAR24|Innovation crucial to our future will be damaged.
BULL25|Expect moves to pack the Supreme Court by expanding the number of justices from the current 9 to perhaps 15 to make sure new constitutionally dubious laws regarding free speech.
NEUT26|How businesses must be run, including national rather than state charters, gun ownership and much else, are upheld.
NEUT27|Not a good future.
NEUT28|Keep a watch out for Georgia.
NEUT29|I'm Steve Forbes.
