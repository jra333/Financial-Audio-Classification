NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol FRO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|So if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT4|Very eventful day today, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one going forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal governor say claim one, make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward and that would be the price can say up there above $9.25 and don't get me wrong if the price falls below 925.
NEUT8|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL9|That would definitely be in a very impressive sign of strength going forward.
NEUT10|Next level of support after that would be this former consolidation area.
NEUT11|From earlier on in the day, which sits down there at the $8.50 mark, so nine 25852 of the near term areas looking at things from a bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average, as the name implies, that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT15|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT16|That right there, I'm defining as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|Everyone must visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what is being represented again.
BULL21|Yes and above 925 would be great.
NEUT22|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart.
NEUT23|What about areas of resistance moving forward?
NEUT24|Initial level, nothing fancy behind it all in the fact of where the party stopped today and that's it's right up there at that round Number of $10 and then of $10 can be broken as you're seeing here.
NEUT25|It's been a long time since the price of an up is high, so things are harder to see, but that's a good problem to have.
NEUT26|But again, after the $10 mark next key level up there right around $10.35 on.
NEUT27|Although Monster movement today, monster volume.
BULL28|So let's see if the price can continue to build on this momentum going forward.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird.
NEUT34|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT35|But in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
