NEUT0|"""Welcome back is the 23rd of June 2020, Tuesday, the 2nd day after week."
NEUT1|So we're just done.
BULL2|Task amenable 12 chaining stellar and now we're going to be at #15 so far.
BEAR3|OK against BTC he last week we were here and now we've dropped lower.
BEAR4|Things are about to turn bearish for OK be against BTC.
NEUT5|Bike you not OK, he's doing then Boo Boo Trent.
NEUT6|Yeah, which means that we have yet to touch this.
NEUT7|Keep in mind everything is breaking it on julai the.
NEUT8|July 2019 and we broke it with proper volume boom, proper candle sticks and we have real estate above it ever since.
BULL9|Right ever since then we have been in a move towards the upside.
BEAR10|We have yet to see any moves towards the downside however, this looks like a potential descending triangle in the making.
NEUT11|This is like mountain one.
NEUT12|We could see a very gigantic mountain.
NEUT13|Two, you can see a mountain tree and we could be dropping back down under the skinny pink line.
NEUT14|Absolutely it could happen.
NEUT15|So I got to be very, very careful because OK has yet to form.
NEUT16|Any proper correction ever since breaking back up, it has yet to form any sort of a correction back down, so at least one time we're still not entirely sure what's happening and we're not going to be rushing into a trick for OK be until we are absolutely sure, but I feel that we could be in a descending triangle and things could be getting better for OK be against BTC.
NEUT17|So yeah, we really have two touches over here.
NEUT18|I think there should be another third or fourth touch first before we drop.
NEUT19|It is going to take several months ago.
NEUT20|Several weeks, several months, but at the same time things could also start to turn bullish.
NEUT21|Right now, this isn't a this could be.
NEUT22|This could be an easy peasy, right?
NEUT23|ABC?
NEUT24|We could go for a D. We could get an E and pull things.
NEUT25|Could just out of nowhere start to turn bullish.
NEUT26|So be very, very careful about.
NEUT27|Opening a short here if you want to short it, you have to be very careful because there's just no guarantees that we're going to drop here, and we could still turn bullish from here as well.
NEUT28|So we would like to see the final set of the move coming for OK be wherever it's going to be bullish, or whether it's going to be bearish.
NEUT29|We will have to wait and see how it goes all right, as we want to be against USD T, But before that please video like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT30|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about maybe in the comments below.
BULL31|4 KB against USD T yeah, we've been slicing through the skin.
NEUT32|Normally when you slice shooters, can you think like you should be coming back down?
BEAR33|Yeah, there should be a bear season waiting for OK be against USD T. More likely than not we should be punching back down under this skinny pink line and we should be spending some time under the skinny pink line, which means that we are expecting a potential move to drop down under the skinny pink line.
BULL34|We might bounce back up and after that so we form continuation pattern.
NEUT35|We go lower and lower for a bear trend for OK. Against USC, Dennis keeping Thanksgiving will start curving back down and after that, once he is finished you will start basing out before it goes back up.
NEUT36|So yeah, it feels like that to me.
NEUT37|It's just that not entirely sure it is just not tradeable.
NEUT38|OK, it's just not tradeable coin.
NEUT39|Not at this point of time so we're not going to do anything until we are absolutely sure.
NEUT40|Alright, I guess you see from my OK be technical analysis.
BULL41|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL42|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT43|"I shall see you in the next video."""
