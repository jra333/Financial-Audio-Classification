NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, this is Paul language discipline trading strategies."
NEUT1|With this week's trade of the week video.
NEUT2|This is for the week ending 1111 2018.
NEUT3|This happened just on Friday the 9th.
NEUT4|The stock was Facebook.
NEUT5|The strategy was based on a 60 minute DTS breakdown play with the entry on a one minute DTS sell side up.
NEUT6|Plus meaning there's something special about that entry besides just the cell setup management advance and reward to risk 1.7 to one.
NEUT7|Let's take a look at the play and how it's set up and how it played out.
NEUT8|First of all, I'd like to remind you as always about the free stuff coming this week to DTS.
NEUT9|There's not a lot of free stuff this week or this month really, but the next event is going to be a presentation by me.
NEUT10|Paul Wednesday, November 28th at 5:00 o'clock.
NEUT11|If your DTS member you will receive login instructions that day.
NEUT12|If you're watching this on YouTube and you're not a member, make sure to get over the site and become a member so you get your invites to this and all the other fun things.
NEUT13|The quote I put up there was.
NEUT14|I've been collecting thoughts since the last presentation and this is going to be my favorite and most informative presentation of the year, so save that date Wednesday at 5:00 o'clock.
NEUT15|Let's get.
NEUT16|I want today's discussion about.
NEUT17|Facebook this is the daily chart of Facebook before the market opened the day of the trade, and the stock was about to open right there.
NEUT18|The daily chart was not terribly informative on this one.
NEUT19|It wasn't really the crux of the trade, it simply agreed with the trade because it was still in a downtrend at kind of a novice gap up and had been fading ever since.
NEUT20|The hourly chart is where I saw this and really love this set up.
NEUT21|This is what I saw in the morning before open and I was scanning and looking for setups.
NEUT22|This is my favorite setup.
NEUT23|I actually described this trade to the room as my.
NEUT24|Bread and butter.
NEUT25|This is my favorite thing that I would do all the time if I found this all the time.
NEUT26|You don't find it every day, but I do find it a few times a week.
NEUT27|This is the breakdown area through here and of course, not only do I have to have this set up, but then I have to have the stock do what I want that morning and it did.
BEAR28|In this case, it gapped down a little bit below that area and then gave an entry and then fell the whole day.
NEUT29|I only had it for the morning and left about half the profits on the table, but that's the breakdown that I was looking at right there.
NEUT30|Let's take a look at a 5 minute chart and see how it's set up a little better.
NEUT31|'cause this is my favorite type of entry.
NEUT32|This was taken at about 934 approximately on that first five minute bar.
NEUT33|That sort of stock opened and my intro is right off there.
BEAR34|Coming off of that topping tail one 4749 Stop 148 thirty one, the site began to fall.
NEUT35|I took an initial quick profit on it.
NEUT36|Half of it one 4642, and then let the rest play out and took the risk about 11:30 ish at one 4576 on their trail stop.
BEAR37|Note it did fall the rest today and could have had about twice the profits had you sat with it.
NEUT38|Into 230 on this Friday.
NEUT39|This, like all the other plays you see in these trade of the week.
NEUT40|Videos are done in the DTS trading.
NEUT41|When we take the time to look for in, find and execute these plays in a very disciplined way.
NEUT42|Generally these plays are done on stocks that are well discussed and also generally good volume stocks, so that is easy to play along without having to worry about slippage most of the time.
NEUT43|This is Paul for DTZ.
NEUT44|"Until next time good trading everybody."""
