NEUT0|"""Max is in Saint Louis."
BULL1|Hey Max, how are you?
BULL2|I'm good.
BULL3|How are you better than I deserve?
NEUT4|What's up?
NEUT5|I, my grandparents, set aside investments for all their grandkids.
NEUT6|They purchased me 100 shares of Facebook years ago.
NEUT7|$32 a share today, that investment is worth right around 28,000 and so my question is, should I just leave it there or should I invest best it elsewhere so that it is more diversified?
NEUT8|OK, somewhere else where it's more diversified, yeah?
NEUT9|I don't own any.
NEUT10|I don't own any single stocks.
NEUT11|I don't play the market.
NEUT12|Ann, you are betting $28,000 on one set of nerds.
NEUT13|I mean you are an I don't know what Facebook is going to do.
NEUT14|Yeah, truthfully, social media team has got.
NEUT15|I mean it are the tech World's got some real targets on there, but right now.
BEAR16|They've been misbehaving and I don't know what that's going to result in.
BEAR17|But Facebook has been screwing with us in business for a long time.
NEUT18|We work with them, but about the time we figure out some way to utilize that stuff, they figure out some way to charge double for it showed it, and you know, it's.
BEAR19|And truthfully, there's a fatigue out there on social media.
BEAR20|In general, people are just sick of it, so I don't know.
NEUT21|I'm not saying that Facebook is going to fail, I'm just not betting $28,000 on their success.
NEUT22|I would rather have that 28,000 in mutual funds, and if they're, if those mutual funds own some Facebook well, so be it.
NEUT23|Yeah, if they own some, Google will, so be it.
NEUT24|But I don't buy single stocks personally.
NEUT25|'cause I don't like the risk Anthony Davis said it best, you know.
NEUT26|And I think listening to Max, it sounds really young.
NEUT27|And he's like, man, you know that's Facebook though.
NEUT28|Dave, you know, and I like what you said.
NEUT29|It's you're putting all your money into not just Facebook, but into one group of people.
NEUT30|And I think I would rather be diversified now if you can get it into Facebook and Google and diversifying it, then great.
NEUT31|So when a company first issue stock for the first time, it's called an IPO.
NEUT32|Yep, an initial public offering an IRA's on the air when Facebook first farms the stock and it was so hyped.
NEUT33|That it went through the roof was like a gold rush.
NEUT34|Wow, it went straight up and then six weeks later it went straight down because it was overhyped.
BEAR35|It was not based on valuation, it was just based on people were just freaking out because it Facebook was cutting edge.
NEUT36|It was so cool.
NEUT37|In those days everybody was believing it was the big deal and it is a big deal.
NEUT38|Obviously there are have become a world player without a doubt yeah but the but I mean I think people should you buy in on the IPO.
NEUT39|Nope, I did not.
NEUT40|I did not.
NEUT41|'cause I know a hype when I see one and single stocks will get you bit, so that's what that's what we wouldn't do.
BULL42|"And hey, thank you for the call."""
