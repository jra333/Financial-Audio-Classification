NEUT0|"""WIN wasn't a hot streak."
NEUT1|And like all things that good St had to eventually end.
NEUT2|At least for the moment and this video, I'll give you my opinion on what's next.
NEUT3|I will also be giving you my updated price prediction as well.

NEUT5|I also make videos on stocks and other cool investments, and to my regular viewers.
NEUT6|What's up?
BULL7|Welcome back.
NEUT8|With that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT9|Let's talk money.
NEUT10|Remember that wink is a gaming platform.
NEUT11|Winks goal is to build an ecosystem that provides high quality, decentralized gaming experience to enable developers to build decentralized apps.
NEUT12|The Wii in Token is a utility token that was built on the Trump blockchain, and this token is then used to incentivize active participation.
NEUT13|WIN.
BULL14|Just hit a new all time high on April 5th, 2021 when they reached the prize of 0.29 cents.
BEAR15|Since then, WIN has taken a 30% dip, which sounds bad.
NEUT16|But once we dig deeper, it's not, and I'll explain why later.
NEUT17|In the video the current market cap is at approximately $1.5 billion, making WIN the 17th largest coin of the crypto world in terms of market cap.
NEUT18|Quick reminder that I am not a financial advisor, nor ever will be, should always be doing your own due diligence.
NEUT19|Let's take the recent price fluctuation of WIN.
BEAR20|Despite the crazy volatility of the past 24 hours, WIN is only down 2%.
BULL21|Have you had Bob WIN 7 days ago would still be up 450%?
BULL22|And how do you bought Wii in 30 days ago would be up 900%.
NEUT23|Let's put things in perspective.
BULL24|It would probably take the S&P 525 to 30 years to match Wis 900% gain of the past 30 days.
BEAR25|Over the past 24 hours, the price of WIN has fluctuated between zero point 18 and 0.29 cents.
NEUT26|At the time of recording WIN is train around 0.21 cents.
BEAR27|In my opinion, the significant dip is mostly attributed to two things.
NEUT28|For one, early investors are locking in their profits.
NEUT29|This naturally happens every time an asset increases his value dramatically in such a short span of time.
NEUT30|Second, one surprise starts.
BEAR31|Dipping this thing causes nervous investors to get scared.
NEUT32|And sell up as they think their investment will free fall all the way down to $0.00.
NEUT33|In my opinion, if you believe in a project long term in the fundamentals of that project haven't changed and you shouldn't be selling after a significant price drop.
NEUT34|This is actually an opportunity for investors to start or increase their positions at a discount.
BULL35|On a video that I posted on March 31st, I predicted WN would at least hit zero point $0.25 by the end of the year.
NEUT36|"Clearly that already happened, so for my updated price prediction, I think WIN will end 2021 at the price of 1 cent on the lower end, or 1.5 cents on the higher end."""
