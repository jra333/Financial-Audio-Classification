NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Monday, February 8th and the market just closed.
NEUT2|In this video I'm going to be talking about sundial growers.
NEUT3|Ticker symbol SMDL.
BULL4|Today's sundial had a great day.
NEUT5|We closed at 13.27% at 1.28 dollars.
NEUT6|Looking at the chart here, you could see that we held the support level around the one point 10.
BULL7|And we bounced right back up.
BULL8|There are site we're almost entering into an overbought territory, but we should still be good.
BULL9|The volume is looking good, you see here, the green bar is much bigger than yesterday's cell volume.
NEUT10|Zooming into the hourly chart in the last video I did on Friday I was talking about the price of around one 13114 that it needs to hold if we're going to have a rally back up to the $1.25.
BULL11|We could see that held nicely.
NEUT12|We were hovering around that price for the day.
NEUT13|As you see here, around the 2:30 mark, we had a major buying going on.
BULL14|It jumped almost 9% in one hour and then it continued till the market closed and we closed at 1.27.
NEUT15|Now one thing I want to watch out for to see here is, is this an actual breakout an are we going to rally all the way up to the dollar forty plus or is this just the big purchase order that occurs in the last two hours and then tomorrow we should see a continuation of this consolidation.
NEUT16|So the determined that then one price level I'm watching for is around the dollar $20.19.
BULL17|So if we open up above that and we stay above that throughout the day, then we could see a continuation of the rally back up.
NEUT18|And that could be a confirmation of this breakout.
NEUT19|If that doesn't hold, then that means this was just.
NEUT20|I would call it Spike, Hiccup and then we go back and we consolidate.
NEUT21|Continue consolidating around.
NEUT22|Above the $1.00 thirteen, $1.14 range, and of course, always keep an eye on the big support levels, which is the one we have.
NEUT23|Here is a dollar and dollar and 10 which is aligned with the 50 moving average.
NEUT24|The yellow line over here.
NEUT25|So it's something to watch out for and also look at the volume in the last two hours.
BEAR26|How high it was compared to the rest of the day.
NEUT27|I'd be a bit cautious on this price and see if it's actually going to hold.
BEAR28|As you see here, we're now trading post market at 1.24, so it went below the $1.25.
NEUT29|So keep an eye around the $1.20 an let's see if that holds tomorrow.
NEUT30|If it is, then we could continue the rally if not.
NEUT31|Will continue the consolidation period.
BULL32|Hope you find this video helpful, as usual.
NEUT33|"Thank you all for watching and see in the next video."""
