NEUT0|"""Hey Trader, Keen CEO and President of alphashark.com."
BEAR1|So we saw a signal today in empty institutional order flow in the option market and trade.
NEUT2|It brought the October 33 calls for 9389 cents.
NEUT3|They actually worth 85 right now.
NEUT4|So I call that a signal in stock to buy empty stack.
NEUT5|This is a steel stock Archer.
NEUT6|Midland at 3230 is that I have proprietary based targets in the course.
NEUT7|When it teacher how you guys get this target, they're not randomly selected guys there's a reason we select these targets.
NEUT8|And these exits.
NEUT9|So by empty 3230 every tradesman 1000 hours rest stop losses 2930, and then at the 150 shares is based on a certain number.
NEUT10|We're going to teach you, and then target number one is 3080 and Target 2 is 30.
NEUT11|Should be 30, target one is 3280.
NEUT12|Well hello 3380.
NEUT13|Let's change it.
NEUT14|3318 Target 2 is.
NEUT15|"3530 thanks and will run it back tomorrow, so by an empty 3230."""
