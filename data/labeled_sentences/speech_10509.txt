NEUT0|"""So how do the numbers look like?"
BULL1|Look the growth here is extraordinary.
BULL2|Last year, DoorDash total orders increased by.
BULL3|It's hard to believe these numbers 217% gross order volume is up 186%.
BULL4|Revenue grew at an astounding 204% clip in the first time.
NEUT5|Lots of 2020.
BULL6|Those figures are holding up total orders, decelerated, tiny bit 290% gross margin order, volume accelerated to 200% revenue growth accelerated to 226% Wow, share an growth, fantastic.
NEUT7|What can I say about a company with 20% revenue growth?
BULL8|Well that's even better than Snowflake, and they've done it in two years in a row.
BEAR9|And when you drill down quarter by quarter, the numbers have been accelerating traumatically over the course of 2020.
NEUT10|But and this is a big bite, obviously.
NEUT11|2020 is a unique moment.
NEUT12|Remember late last year DoorDash acquired Caviar, meaning not all the growth is organic.
NEUT13|Snowflake is organic muscle.
BULL14|Top of that they're getting a major boost from the pandemic.
NEUT15|That makes it tough to figure out how quickly they'll be able to grow in the future.
NEUT16|If and when the pandemic is finally, say, under control, how about profitability?
BEAR17|Well, DoorDash is still far from profitable.
BULL18|Their margins are headed in the right direction and fast to the point where they actually generating positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation.
NEUT19|I did not think that was possible this fast.
NEUT20|These gig economy plays also like to talk about what's called their contribution margin.
NEUT21|What they make after you subtract all sorts of variable costs like marketing and stock based compensation.
BULL22|And in the case of DoorDash the contribution margin swung from negative 2% last year, top 3% in the first nine months of the year and that's about what we'd expect given that the on demand delivery business has become a lot less competitive.
BULL23|In the past 12 months, because of all of the agglomeration the it's been incredible, you should be able to pick these guys against each other.
NEUT24|Remember, I own restaurant and bar.
NEUT25|I know these things.
BEAR26|My big concern here is that door Dash is coming in hot.
BEAR27|The numbers are fabulous right now, but we don't know how much of that is sustainable.
BEAR28|So I expect the IPO to catch fire right out of Gate even as I worry that it's destined for a pullback when the growth slows in 2021 and the company is up against some very tough comparisons.
NEUT29|We know DoorDash plans to come public at a 90 to $95 price range.
NEUT30|Final price should be announced tomorrow at the midpoint.
NEUT31|We're talking about a $30 billion valuation and you know what?
NEUT32|Based on the estimates from DA Davidson, the stock will be trading at less than seven times.
NEUT33|Next year's sales estimates.
NEUT34|I know people say, oh, come on Jim, we care about earnings, fast growth, you do it by sales, right?
BULL35|It's pretty cheap for a company with 200% growth, although it's more expensive than it.
NEUT36|Slower growing peers like Grubhub give that door.
BEAR37|Dash is growth is expected to slow to 56% next year.
NEUT38|I'd be asking to give it a cloud style valuation.
NEUT39|I think $100 reason prices, but I doubt you'll be able to get that look.
NEUT40|Here's the bottom line.
NEUT41|Door Dash is a terrific story, but it's business.
BEAR42|Could slow substantially next year, so I recommend being careful with it.
NEUT43|You can get it for $100 less.
NEUT44|You got my bussing.
NEUT45|Otherwise sorry you had to get in on the deal because you can't chase these.
NEUT46|You just can't.
