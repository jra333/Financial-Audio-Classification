BULL0|"""Hey guys."
NEUT1|This is Jeff good here, just wanted to go over my trade quickly for today.
NEUT2|It's October 30 and I took one trade today GE and had earnings today.
NEUT3|Premarket and I was just reviewing the NEWS UPDATE.
BEAR4|It looks like they missed.
NEUT5|Earnings per share and revvs.
NEUT6|And.
NEUT7|Specifically, I was reading the statements by.
NEUT8|The CEO didn't have anything there solid that sounded.
NEUT9|Very interesting to keep investors aroused.
BULL10|It was a lot of we're going to be better, do better.
NEUT11|Kind of statements here, for example, says after my first few weeks on the job, it's clear to me that G is fundamentally strong.
BEAR12|However, we are far from our full potential.
NEUT13|And then he goes on to talk about.
BULL14|We can deliver better results.
NEUT15|And so he because he didn't have any specific.
NEUT16|Information about how that would happen.
NEUT17|You and you look at the free market you see here.
BULL18|It's selling off here today.
NEUT19|Free market.
NEUT20|And.
BULL21|It starts to go up in the opening.
NEUT22|My idea was.
NEUT23|Be patient, let it do its thing in between.
NEUT24|10 and 11.
NEUT25|You if it starts to make lower highs.
NEUT26|Yeah, it may be one of those.
NEUT27|The buyers get exhausted and so I started looking at this area here.
NEUT28|Anne didn't really pay attention till after 10:00 o'clock.
NEUT29|And then I I see it as seen it I really wanted to wait halfway towards 11, but.
BEAR30|He started it looked like it was starting to go down, so I got in here short and was reaching high of day and so I closed out my position here.
NEUT31|And.
NEUT32|Got back in here.
NEUT33|Anne.
NEUT34|My initial thoughts was I'm going to let it ride, however it start pulling back faster than I thought and at this point it looked like.
BEAR35|Over extension on the downside, and in hindsight I was wrong.
NEUT36|And I could have definitely been more.
BEAR37|Patients are covered half here.
NEUT38|You know I covered half here.
NEUT39|Eating my time came down here started holding for awhile I was thinking OK, this might be reversal get out so I got all out and then ride the rest.
NEUT40|Of that there on the downside.
NEUT41|So how's my trade today?
NEUT42|"And if you have any questions, please let me know, thank you."""
