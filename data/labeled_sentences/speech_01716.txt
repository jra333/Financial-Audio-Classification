BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|We're going to be doing some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency BT which is BitTorrent against tether US based on Binance crisis.
NEUT2|This is just a follow up from the last videos I made so I'd kind of mentioned that this one could break a penny.
BULL3|It would have a lot bigger run ahead so after that kind of an I'll show you the daily chart had cracked that high that we had been talking about.
NEUT4|This one had a huge run up extra like 3540% from there kind of put in the shooting star candle on the daily Now starting to put in the hammer or even like.
NEUT5|A little bit more of a doje, so this kind of signifies that there might be a pullback, which if you were waiting, you could have got a huge dip opportunity.
BEAR6|Now this candles kind of representing some indecision.
NEUT7|So if we put the four hour chart, this will just be a lot easier to talk about.
BULL8|We had a big move up, a pull back.
BEAR9|The price is still hanging out above the prior breakout spot depending where you draw out like your trendlines or where you draw your support and resistance.
NEUT10|You could argue like that 007 like 8 ish level was kind of the big breakout spot.
NEUT11|It's almost perfectly backtested, that so as long as it can consolidate kind of above that level.
NEUT12|This one still has a pretty good look to it.
NEUT13|I mean you could see that this one is starting to put in this like micro downtrend so in the shorter term this level these levels need to be broken.
NEUT14|And I'll draw this up for you guys so you can see a little bit better, but I mean you have one to the upside and one kind of like.
NEUT15|Yeah, you have it to the upside and the lower part of here.
NEUT16|So like would I be looking for at this point is a break of this upside.
NEUT17|Kind of.
NEUT18|Part of the channel and you don't really want to see it lose the downside of the channel, because in this one's gonna start to look pretty bearish to me.
BEAR19|Especially after such a big run up, if it starts to lose loses like 0077 level, I think this one could potentially go back to anywhere from like the high Sixes to the low 70s.
NEUT20|I mean definitely possible.
NEUT21|So what I want to see happen is a break to the upside with some volume.
BULL22|Again, a big spot that this one needs to recapture at this point is a penny and it needs to start to hold above that on the four hour 'cause I would hope.
NEUT23|And with the next candle you know opening up in about 30 minutes, you're going to want to see this one now.
NEUT24|Continue to be upside.
BULL25|If it starts to pull back and consolidate though again, as long as it hangs out above this like 0078 ish level and consolidate somewhere in this range, this one still looks fine to me.
NEUT26|So ultimately turn this one really bullish.
NEUT27|A break of a penny, but really more of like that 1.05 kind of scent range is a big spot.
BULL28|And then obviously the top of this week here around that like 1.1 cent level could potentially send this one back up to highs.
NEUT29|But you also need to like I said, monitor the downside of this channel along with this support level around that 0078 Mark.
