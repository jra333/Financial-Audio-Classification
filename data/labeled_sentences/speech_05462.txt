BULL0|"""Something that has been a little bit off the radar screen, but a few weeks ago the big out of growth into value, rotation, trade, but you're still seeing signs of it."
NEUT1|In fact, we have a terminal here that sort of interesting.
BULL2|Showing that value is starting to try to outperform growth.
NEUT3|Yeah, it's interesting.
NEUT4|We definitely saw this in September and then kind of went radio silent for a couple of weeks and you could see that it's really kind of picked up the last couple of days, so I think what's interesting here is not only are you seeing this right now, but it's also a little bit seasonal, so we're also seeing this.
NEUT5|We saw this at the end of 2018.
BULL6|You know we saw move up and as well as 2016 you could see a really big move up.
NEUT7|What drives that?
NEUT8|What season?
NEUT9|Why do investors go?
NEUT10|Is it because they've had a good year and they want to kind of lock in gains so they go toward the quote unquote, safer stocks, or what?
NEUT11|Beyond that, yeah, I I don't actually have the reasoning behind it other than I think it's just really gotten cheap, especially this time.
NEUT12|If you kind of look, go back to that chart.
BEAR13|You'll see that over the last couple of years it's really gotten stretched, and it's been overcrowded.
NEUT14|And I think part of that is also to do with the trade war.
BEAR15|There's been a lot of hiding places people flocked to software.
NEUT16|Now they're coming out of software, got it, and they want something that will perhaps be quote unquote, safe in a time of uncertainty.
NEUT17|Or what are you seeing beneath the surface and options land that suggests that either this rotation will continue.
NEUT18|Duration of it?
NEUT19|Or maybe it's not going to.
BULL20|Yeah, and I think you know right now we're in the heart of earning season, so it's a little bit noisy with with option flows, but we are seeing positioning an.
NEUT21|We've been seeing the banks we saw that even before earnings, but we're seeing that continued, so it's not huge block type type trades, but just smaller trades and a lot of industrial.
NEUT22|A lot of the banks and a lot of energy names too.
NEUT23|OK, so that does sound.
NEUT24|I don't want to say cautious, but it certainly doesn't sound aggressive, so it would support if that's what you're seeing.
NEUT25|You know with underlying calls and puts and that sort of thing support this idea that investors are still going into valuan in terms of value.
NEUT26|The biggest name out there, Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT27|And that is your trade idea.
NEUT28|Talk to us about what you like here.
NEUT29|Yeah, I like this trade a lot.
NEUT30|I called birds.
NEUT31|Are Berkshire Hathaway the King of all value?
NEUT32|And I think you know it sets up really well here.
NEUT33|I think it's actually it hasn't LED in terms of you know the value starting to move.
NEUT34|I think it's one of those that will kind of start to move now.
NEUT35|And I think right now you have a triangle pattern.
NEUT36|That it needs to get out in front of so you don't have to get into this trade right?
NEUT37|"This second, I think you can wait for a little bit of confirmation, but I do like the December 215 calls to play this theme."""
