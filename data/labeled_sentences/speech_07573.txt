NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX empire."
BULL1|Walt Disney broke out in April of 2019 after announcing the release date of this new Disney Plus streaming service that came online in November, triggering one big last spike up above the 150 level stock, then pulled back from that level in plunge during the pandemic and spent many months working its way back up the prior high finally completely 100% retracement.
NEUT2|Just about two days ago now, the stock broke out today after a Wells Fargo upgrade and now it's trading at all time high now.
BEAR3|The problem is the stock.
BEAR4|The company reported a 30% revenue decline in the last quarter, highlighting its dependence on big blockbusters, which have been stopped dead in their tracks due to the pandemic.
NEUT5|Now the Disney Plus streaming service is taken over the helm, but is producing near not nearly the amount of income produced by movie production.
NEUT6|So until movie production gets back online, Disney is not going to be booking the revenues that it has in the past.
NEUT7|In prior years.
NEUT8|Now, this is a great rally to an all time high, but take a look at accumulation reading through obv.
BULL9|If only come back up to about the halfway point of this big decline.
BEAR10|In fact, Obv is still trading below the September peak when the stock was trading down the one 30s.
BEAR11|Now this is setting off a huge bearish divergent which predicts that this up breakout is going to fail.
BEAR12|It could add some points before felling, but the odds are high that it's going to fail.
NEUT13|Perhaps come all the way down to fill this gap.
BULL14|Now this area right here between in the high one 20s and low one 30s looks like an excellent place.
BULL15|"They got on board sometime in 2021 for a more sustained rally that get Disney back up and over 200."""
