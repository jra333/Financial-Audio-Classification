NEUT14|McDonald's, you have Cisco PNG which is Procter and Gamble, Clorox, Coca Cola, Pepsi.
NEUT15|I actually mentioned Pepsi not too long ago in one of my videos.
NEUT16|Federal Realty Investment trust.
NEUT17|This is a I'm actually thinking of getting some shares from this company because they are extremely reputable.
NEUT18|Company Reit's are on the more risky side sometimes because just it fluctuates so much that.
NEUT19|It makes it a risky investment, but regardless, this is actually something really good to have on your portfolio just to balance everything out for the healthcare we have.
NEUT20|Abby Ann.
NEUT21|We have Johnson and Johnson.
