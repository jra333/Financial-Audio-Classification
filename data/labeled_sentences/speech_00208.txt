NEUT1|Investment idea of the day, which is a buy call on Pfizer.
NEUT2|So what's behind that bullish outlook?
NEUT3|Well, let's take a look.
NEUT4|This comes by way of Argus Research.
NEUT5|This is a fundamental report on Pfizer and you can see there the stock really hasn't done much over the last year.
BEAR6|It's done down about 5%.
NEUT7|But let's take a look at some of their reasoning here.
NEUT8|So they're saying they're maintaining their $55 price target with the reasoning that Pfizer is scaling up manufacturing to meet its commitment to deliver 2 billion doses of its coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year.
NEUT9|Management projects approximately $15 billion in 2021.
NEUT10|Revenue from the vaccine.
BULL11|Making it by far the largest product in their portfolio.
BEAR12|However, we think the market is underestimating the sustainability of the COVID-19 vaccine franchise and its revenue contribution beyond 2021.
BULL13|We believe that this revenue will prove sustainable based on the company's ability to use the M RNA platform to develop vaccine booster shots and address new virus variants as well as to create treatments for other conditions.
NEUT14|"So there you have it there, Kristen."""
