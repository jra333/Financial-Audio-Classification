BEAR0|"""However, last night, the iPod dock in weekly chart we can see even though we got a red candle and closed below the first year, my line we're still in the midst."
BULL1|It's a bullish trend because we can see it's not the first time it has penetrated this first year.
NEUT2|My life here.
BEAR3|Here we all drop down below this line and then we all bounced back from here.
NEUT4|Especially we can see here a lower shadow means the buyer already stepped in.
NEUT5|So in my opinion, emitter Apple is still in the option.
NEUT6|But The thing is that the initial.
NEUT7|Gas that here is a Cup and here should be a handle has been invited.
NEUT8|But sometimes we know the handle should have the first stage of lower price action.
BEAR9|Lower than the height has mean at the beginning of the handle.
NEUT10|That means here is still reasonable.
NEUT11|So as long as we keep it above the yummy line.
NEUT12|"There's still possibility for Apple to make a Cup and handle pattern, so just wait, thank you."""
