NEUT0|"""I know Donald Trump."
BULL1|He's a great guy.
NEUT2|He he doesn't do everything he says, but he sure tries and I'm a big fan of Donald Trump saying he's going to run.
NEUT3|I have no idea.
NEUT4|You'll have to ask Donald Trump, everybody, everybody share this video so your liberal friends, your Democrat friends, see that Bloomberg was a Trump dude for particular amount of time.
NEUT5|Let me play one more time.
NEUT6|I know Donald Trump.
BULL7|He's a great guy.
NEUT8|He he doesn't do everything he says but he sure tries.
NEUT9|And I'm a big fan of Donald Trump saying he's going to run.
NEUT10|I have no idea what happened.
NEUT11|Why did Bloomberg flip the switch on Trump?
NEUT12|Why did he say I love Trump?
NEUT13|I'm a big fan of his and then now he's saying Trump's a sexist whatever.
BEAR14|Go on going on the whole Trump's terrible bad for the country hold rent.
NEUT15|You want to know why?
NEUT16|Because probably deep down Bloomberg, he doesn't really have an allegiance.
NEUT17|I think he's a radical leftist, but also.
NEUT18|At the same, we know for his own billionaire personal game, but at the same time, Bloomberg is somebody that just wants to get power.
NEUT19|So he sees Trump's president.
NEUT20|He's probably jealous.
NEUT21|He wants to get that power.
NEUT22|How can you do it?
NEUT23|Let me just start bashing on Trump.
NEUT24|Let me start bashing on Trump.
NEUT25|This way I can come into the election and try to take him out.
NEUT26|That's probably what he's thinking.
NEUT27|If he was smart, he would wait until Trump's out of office and then run as a Republican after him and go full blown Republican because Republicans will respect billionaires who are also Republicans.
NEUT28|Democrats won't.
NEUT29|They'll take your money, that's for sure.
NEUT30|You could probably buy him off and pay them off for votes, but.
NEUT31|You're not going to get that respect from people in the Democrat Party if you're a billionaire because their whole party is based on destroying you.
NEUT32|So.
BEAR33|That's why he got destroyed during the debates.
NEUT34|That's why he's getting destroyed by the left on all over the Internet.
BEAR35|I'm seeing that's why he's getting destroyed by the left in person as well.
BEAR36|Where there are people on the left who hate Bloomberg just as much as they hate Trump and they would not concede into voting for Bloomberg.
NEUT37|So if Bloomberg thinks about or he's actively, he's definitely actively going to try to rig the DNC and steal the primary.
NEUT38|No, he's trying to do that.
NEUT39|You can see he's investing using probably spend up to two to $3 billion to try to.
NEUT40|When this election, I personally think you could only spend so much money before you're just repeating Lee.
NEUT41|Putting your ad in front of the same people over and over again.
NEUT42|I mean, we've all seen Bloomberg ads at this point.
NEUT43|I bet you there was one probably planned before this video.
NEUT44|Who knows if it's not demonetized but.
NEUT45|It's.
NEUT46|Let him waste all of his money.
NEUT47|I'll probably make some of that just because it is.
NEUT48|Ads are going to be running on my content, so I'm joking about that, but yet complicated your thoughts.
NEUT49|Do you think he's trying to steal the show this week?
NEUT50|We're Democrat friends, that's for sure.
NEUT51|Make them really ****** at him and guys watch it like scribe notifications on.
NEUT52|I post every single day and text me if you want to stay updated.
NEUT53|My numbers up on screen.
BULL54|Thanks guys for watching.
NEUT55|"Peace out."""
