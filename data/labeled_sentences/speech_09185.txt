BULL0|"""So there is already at least one prediction of Bitcoin soaring to 50,000 this year."
NEUT1|At least one.
NEUT2|And there are people that think it could go much higher than that.
BULL3|Now Bitcoin is entering the new year in Full Bull mode, briefly exceeding that 34,000 milestone as the recent eye popping rally continues now as we look at the Bloomberg, you can see Bitcoin now.
BEAR4|The white line on the right showing the rise since 2018 has literally blown away the prior rallies from 2015 to 2017, and the latest jump comes on the heels of bitcoins.
BULL5|Huge jump in December where it surpassed the $20,000 milestone and registered to jump up about 50% in that month alone.
BULL6|What many were calling us Santa rally now that's leading Anthony trenches.
NEUT7|Who is the co-founder of Nexo in London?
NEUT8|It's a company that built itself is the biggest Bitcoin lender.
NEUT9|He's the one predicting that Bitcoin could well be on the road to 50,000 this year, probably, and this is his prediction in the first quarter of 2021.
BULL10|And Bitcoin has increasingly been embraced by many institutional investors.
NEUT11|It's clearly on the radar of many banks, and what many have really realized in late December of 2020 is that Bitcoin is moved out of the arena of speculators and techniques, and it's starting to get really contraction in real tension late last month.
NEUT12|As you may know, the first NFL football player here in the US had a written into his contract that he would collect.
NEUT13|Top of his pay in Bitcoin.
NEUT14|Kathleen will Sue and of course it was Scott Minerd here on Bloomberg Television famously said that Bitcoin could go over $400,000, and I think it's wanting a lot of us would never look at Bitcoin or looking at it now.
NEUT15|What are the other issues for digital currencies in 2021 that we need to be aware of before we think about diving in?
NEUT16|Yeah, volatility.
NEUT17|Certainly a very big issue.
BEAR18|I mean if you look at where Bitcoin has come to where it is now, there certainly been a lot of glitches along the way.
BEAR19|The Santa Claus Rally is one that we've talked a lot about, but if you can recall it tripped in November 26 we saw Bitcoin slump as much as 14%.
BEAR20|It's had major declines before then, and so volatility in fact is a major issue.
NEUT21|Yes, God mitred did say and he's Guggenheim investments that he thinks.
NEUT22|He could see Bitcoin at 400,000 again.
NEUT23|It just shows you there's an increasing embracing of Bitcoin by many institutional investors.
BEAR24|"However, it remains a thinly traded asset and so many are concerned with it can continue the very bullish run we've seen in the past few months, and that is clearly going to be a big question for 2021."""
