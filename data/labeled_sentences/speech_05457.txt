NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol PT."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will a very, very wild ride today price all over the place and some updates certainly need to be done first update that actually played out perfectly as far as you know.
NEUT5|Could you throw this into an example of a textbook and you absolutely could.
NEUT6|But first update comes out based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance and like I said, that is exactly what happened here.
NEUT7|So going another day $0.22.
BEAR8|Was that level of support, but the price broke down below it and you can see right there.
BEAR9|Bounce back and got rejected right there.
BEAR10|Got rejected right there again got rejected so well.
NEUT11|I'm not saying that $0.22 can never ever be broken up above my core point here is that moving forward.
NEUT12|It's become very clear that if there is going to be any sort of attempted, you know momentum and you know price movements getting back up to that $0.25 mark and it all starts and ends with.
NEUT13|Can the price at least break above $0.22?
BULL14|'cause as of right now it's been a struggle, which again doesn't mean that it will continue to always be a struggle.
NEUT15|But that's just kind of the lesson learned today.
BULL16|Is that there does seem to be some sellers around that 22 cent mark, so that'll certainly be Public Enemy number one resistance wise as far as levels of support or concern.
NEUT17|First, the level of support that you're going to want to keep an eye on in the near term, and this would be the preferable level.
NEUT18|Weekly you know what make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
NEUT19|And that would be the price could say up there above $0.19 and then of $0.19 can't quite hold up next key.
NEUT20|Overall level would be that bigger picture level down there around 15 and 15 cents.
NEUT21|So keep writing these subtle levels moving forward and we'll see what happens with that.
NEUT22|But yeah, no doubt about it.
BULL23|A lot of volatility here, but the overall trend is still up.
BULL24|The price does still have the opportunity to build, and you know, big picture, higher base.
NEUT25|So we'll see if the price can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT26|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.

NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR34|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
