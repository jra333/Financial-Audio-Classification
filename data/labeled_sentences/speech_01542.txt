NEUT4|OK, let's go to the daily charts.
NEUT5|And let's take a look at what he's doing so we can see that we have here.
NEUT6|Destroy that we have apparel channel that the that beyond meat has been doing since since March 2020.
NEUT7|You can see that the price founder resistance right here need to $120.00 worth the price touched the upper side of the channel and it went down so that day the price.
NEUT8|Ice gave us a Berry butter about candle.
NEUT9|OK, we can see right here.
NEUT10|This red candle.
NEUT11|The future scandals about signal.
BEAR12|OK, the price they didn't even struggle a little bit with the with the upper side of the channel it just went down in the price open there and it went all the way down so we can see that now the price is trying to fill the gap that it left.
NEUT13|That day so I can speak the price to try to visit the the lower side of the channel.
NEUT14|OK.
BEAR15|However, if we see the price are active here in the 200 moving average, it could give us a signal that the price is trying to to go up again.
NEUT16|So this is an important level right now where we have the different moving average because it's a square where we have this $140.00 range that we have seen that this level worked as a support and as a resistance in the past.
NEUT17|We can see right here.
NEUT18|OK, we can see that it worked as as as a resistance were here in December.
NEUT19|Has a resistance hearing also into any on in several occasions.
NEUT20|OK, this is an important area between the $130 thirty, $50 and $140.00.
NEUT21|So let's see what the price does.
NEUT22|If it eventually goes there.
NEUT23|So another level levels to watch.
NEUT24|If we draw the fever Nachi levels right here of all these these movements since March 2020, we can see that the.
NEUT25|61.8 level is right here.
BEAR26|Exactly in the $113 where the price fell to supporting the lower side of the channel in generation 21.
NEUT27|Aren't unimportant level to watch, would be, of course yes the 38.2, but this world 50% because the price could meet this 50% in the lower side of the channel and this could be an important range that could make the price react upward because these areas as well the the support and resistance that we mentioned before.
NEUT28|Important levels of 130 five $140.00.
NEUT29|So if we assume in a little bit we go to the hourly chart.
BEAR30|You can see that the price is currently struggling.
NEUT31|We did 200 moving average to the hourly one.
NEUT32|So let's see if the price reacts there.
BULL33|Let's see if the price is able to find the support there and make its way back up again.
NEUT34|But as it looks right now, I believe that the price could visit the lower side of the channel.
