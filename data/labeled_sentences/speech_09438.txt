BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want talk about Clorox today.
NEUT2|So what Clorox does is Clorox and fun fact.
NEUT3|Bleach is not even really a thing in Germany.
NEUT4|So you have bleach for clothes like as additive to detergent.
NEUT5|But beyond that it's not a thing like no one uses bleach to clean their floors or bathrooms or whatever.
NEUT6|So very American company, obviously.
NEUT7|Current price $224.25, which gives the market cap of $28 billion.
BULL8|Dividend yield is just under 2% with the payout ratio of 57%, which is pretty decent.
NEUT9|Revenue $6.7 billion earnings $939 million and they have a PE of 30 with a four P of 32.
NEUT10|So it's currently almost 30.5 and the forward PE is.
NEUT11|Just over 31.5 so obviously not a huge deal there, like the difference between this year and next year is fairly minor.
NEUT12|Obviously that was.
NEUT13|Actually, it wasn't.
NEUT14|Their earnings report was 6:30, so obviously they do include the current situation in their numbers, so I would actually assume that that's fairly accurate.
NEUT15|Total assets $6.2 billion total liabilities $5.3 billion, which gives them total stockholders equity of $908 million.
NEUT16|So overall.
NEUT17|First of all, as far as risk factors go.
BULL18|They are well established.
BULL19|The competitors are well established.
NEUT20|There's really no surprises there.
NEUT21|They kind of develop new stuff here and there, but it's mostly just.
NEUT22|It's it's never anything big.
NEUT23|It's never anything that is going to be a huge success.
NEUT24|It's just kind of a convenient.
NEUT25|In advance, inconvenience or something like that.
NEUT26|So obviously for growth, investor growth of almost 10% is obviously fairly significant, but I don't think that you can rely on that long term.
NEUT27|And I really don't think that the company is going to, you know, quintuple their market cap anytime soon, so I don't think growth investors are going to be interested in this for a dividend investor, I think the dividend yield is pretty low even though the payout ratio is also relatively low and.
NEUT28|I wouldn't mind diversifying into this, but as a main stock I think that you kind of want a higher interest rate than this.
BULL29|This is a pretty solid stock though, and it's a pretty steady stock, so if safety is your number one concern, this is actually going to be pretty decent, but even for that there's probably better candidates out there for a value investor.
BULL30|The P is pretty high.
BULL31|Both revenue and earnings are growing pretty nicely.
BEAR32|The balance sheet doesn't look great.
BULL33|The dividend is a nice bonus though, so overall I think that a value investor is going to have a problem with the balance sheet and a problem with the PE, but everything else looks pretty solid, so again, I wouldn't mind to diversify into this really, but I really don't think it's it should be a big investment for anyone.
NEUT34|That's it for me for today.
