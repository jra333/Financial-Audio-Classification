NEUT0|"""Hello Friends, welcome to episode 12 or stock market technical analysis."
NEUT1|I'm other there from mostly bearish so as of now in the playlist stock market technical analysis we have covered these topics in the previous episode we spoke about engulfment candle.
NEUT2|So today we're going to be talking about harami pattern.
NEUT3|Is a Japanese name which means pregnant and this is not the meaning in Hindi.
NEUT4|So let's get to it.
NEUT5|You'll understand why it is called that.
NEUT6|Let's take a look at how the pattern looks, why it is called that.
NEUT7|An on chart.
NEUT8|What are the effects of the pattern?
NEUT9|So what you see right now on your screen?
NEUT10|So this pattern is called a harami pattern.
NEUT11|OK, So what you see here is a bullish harami and what you see here is a bearish harami.
NEUT12|So for a bullish harami, the prior candle should be big.
NEUT13|An off red color where there is selling pressure whereas the next scandal is a small candle and it is of the opposite color that will be green.
NEUT14|So this might show that interest of buyers in this scandal.
NEUT15|So if the trend is downwards and you see this, there might be.
BULL16|An interest in buying an you can see a reversal in the trend, whereas bearish harami pattern.
BEAR17|If you see this the trend was upwards.
NEUT18|There is a big green candle where the buyers are pushing the prices up and then there is some kind of a gap and then sellers push.
BEAR19|The price is a little down.
NEUT20|This is called the bearish harami and harami being a Japanese word which means pregnant.
NEUT21|The main reason is because of the shape of the candle how it looks.
NEUT22|So I hope this is clear.
BEAR23|This can indicate a reversal in the trend for the specific time frame that you're watching.
NEUT24|So now let's take a look at the charts to understand better.
NEUT25|So on this chart you can observe how bullish harami pattern looks.
BEAR26|So if you look here, there's a selling pressure.
NEUT27|There is a big red candle followed by this buying candle.
NEUT28|So this whole setup can be assumed to be a bullish harami.
BULL29|The prices from here in short term frame did go up.
NEUT30|Now let's take a look at bearish army pattern.
NEUT31|So if you see these prices the prices were moving up and then after that there is a red candle.
BEAR32|If you see here this can be considered to be a bearish harami pattern and if you see the prices started dropping from there.
NEUT33|So I hope today's candle stick pattern is clear.
NEUT34|We saw the candle how it looks, why it is given the name like that and even on charts.
