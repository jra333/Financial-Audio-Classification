BEAR0|"""We are smack dab in the middle of a big sell off on Wall Street."
BEAR1|In fact, the selling is intensifying as we near the closing Bell.
BEAR2|I want to bring Jerrod Blicker E for a look at what is sending us lower as I look at the numbers now, Jaradat were off our worst levels of the day.
BEAR3|The Dow was down much more than 600 points earlier, starting to come back a little bit.
NEUT4|We had been.
BEAR5|I'll tell you what if you blink, you miss these moves because we are now hitting session lows in the NASDAQ.
NEUT6|So here's a here's a four day look, actually, uh, basically what's happened this week.
BEAR7|You can see we're off more than four percent 3% of that coming today alone.
NEUT8|And I'll tell you what, it's all about the bond market and Powell right now, and I'm going to walk us through this.
NEUT9|So here is the VIX.
BULL10|We can see the VIX now on this two months chart, the highest level in over a month.
BEAR11|You have to go back to early February, so that's indicating stress in the markets.
NEUT12|You look at the 10 year.
NEUT13|Five year T note yield.
BULL14|That's up five basis points here, the tenures up.
BULL15|Even more.
NEUT16|It's up 7 basis points and all of this comes from Powell really not giving any assurance that the Fed is concerned about what's happening with rising yields.
NEUT17|And there are a couple of there's a lot of wonky stuff here at play, but suffice to say that there is a covid era program that allowed banks to basically re leverage or up their leverage and buy more securities that set to extend or etcetc to set to expire at the end of the month here.
BEAR18|And if it does expire, we're probably going to see more turmoil in the bond markets, because banks would have to deleverage now also saying the US dollar at the highest levels, almost taking out this February peak here.
BEAR19|This is very important too, because when we have funding stress in the US as we do right now in this turmoil in the bond market, the dollar tends to spike and this puts further pressure on risk markets.
NEUT20|So here's the six month look and you can see very clearly that we are about to take out these highs here, and if this is a new uptrend.
BEAR21|This is going to cause more problems for the bond market.
NEUT22|There are a few things the Fed could do, Powell indicated none of it today, so maybe we have to wait until March 17th for the FOMC meeting.
NEUT23|But I suspect Paul is going to be forced to take action sooner rather than later.
NEUT24|Alexis.
BULL25|"Alright, thanks a lot for the wrap up Jerrod."""
