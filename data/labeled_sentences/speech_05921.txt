NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is DJ and welcome to my channel so let's go ahead and review what's happening with Facebook stock and should we keep it or it's time to go out of Facebook stock."
BEAR1|So if you can see last week it fell all the way from 244.
NEUT2|2.
NEUT3|$210 and it's around 8% change, so if you can see on the left side.
NEUT4|It's around 8:00.
NEUT5|8 degrees in a total stock within like two to three days, but since June 29 it's been going up, so if if I zoom in and see what's going on from June 29 and it's been going up and.
NEUT6|It's.
NEUT7|Going up to 226.
NEUT8|Let's go to one day.
BEAR9|Which was on Friday is still still volatile.
NEUT10|It's still not at the price where it was.
NEUT11|But as far as the market share, it's 35 billion market cap, so it's a huge company.
NEUT12|They don't have only give a space, or you ask users it's all over the world.
NEUT13|So thing is happening with the ad picot on Facebook.
NEUT14|It's going to impact Facebook in the short term, but if you can see past month.
NEUT15|And zoom out from here.
NEUT16|Even when the COVID-19 happened.
BULL17|It it went down, but it was back up.
NEUT18|So if you see it's one one year average.
BULL19|It's pretty good.
NEUT20|It's been going up and it's not only a social media company, I would say it has a huge.
NEUT21|Influence on the Internet and Information Technologies company.
NEUT22|So most of your major mutual fund and index fund if you see.
NEUT23|Even the ETF does contain this Facebook stock, so for the short term.
NEUT24|Gators, I would say.
BULL25|It's it's a good time to buy because it's going to go up within a month or so.
NEUT26|That's what my.
BULL27|Idea is and for the long term I would definitely recommend.
NEUT28|This is the very good time to.
NEUT29|Jump in and buy the stock 'cause it's going to go up.
NEUT30|Within few months, regardless of the ad by court so.
NEUT31|Yeah, I'm I'm I'm buying it.
NEUT32|As well.
BULL33|This is a good time this dip I think gives lauzier opportunity to other people as well.
NEUT34|So I would recommend people to buy it.
NEUT35|And who are holding them?
NEUT36|Don't sell it as of right now.
BULL37|It's going to go up as you can see.
BULL38|It's been rising since.
NEUT39|The code would happen.
BULL40|And it's going to stay strong, so.
NEUT41|I would recommend this.
NEUT42|And thank you for watching the video.
NEUT43|I'll show you and talk to you about the next video.
NEUT44|"Keep watching and please subscribe to my channel, thanks."""
