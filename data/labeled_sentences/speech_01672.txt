NEUT0|"""Well, that leads nicely to my next question, which is about a subset of exchange traded funds."
NEUT1|The strategic beta funds and they're not necessarily ETF 's in fact yesterday.
NEUT2|You said that in some ways, the Vanguard growth and value indexes were the first strategic beta or smart beta products so what's your take on those products useful not so useful?
NEUT3|Well, that's a complicated question, but let me just say this.
NEUT4|For the record, Morningstar.
NEUT5|Counts them as as.
NEUT6|Factor funds or strategic beta funds, and they happen to be these funds I created in 1993 happened to be.
NEUT7|The oldest and largest strategic beta funds.
NEUT8|So how can that be since I don't believe in factor investing, the answer is pretty easy.
NEUT9|I didn't create them to be traded with one with one another.
NEUT10|I created them to be.
BEAR11|With the Growth Fund to be bought during your accumulation phase, we have less taxable income and maybe a little more volatility.
NEUT12|And then when you get to the distribution phase of your retirement account, he got more in common, a little less volatility, not very complicated, and I warned investors in two consecutive annual reports don't trade them and then I said, you know, the most likely thing is that in the long term both growth and value will have the same return.
NEUT13|Well, 25 years later, growth and value funds.
BULL14|Both had a nine point 1% return.
NEUT15|You can't get an awful lot closer than that, right?
BULL16|And yet the average investor got, I think a 7% return.
NEUT17|The investor.
NEUT18|Now.
NEUT19|Not the fun in the Growth Fund and a 5% in the OR 7%.
NEUT20|Growth fund I think in 5% in the value of something like that I made the numbers a little bit off so investors lagged and then you cumulate that over 25 years.
NEUT21|That lag is enormous so investors did when I told him not to do I told him not to do it Christine and trade it and to their own disadvantage.
NEUT22|So I feel so funny.
NEUT23|And as I don't believe in factor funds I believe factors come and go.
NEUT24|I believe that that the coming and going and a factor cycle is unpredictable and.
BULL25|"The record, I think pretty much bears me out."""
