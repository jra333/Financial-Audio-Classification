NEUT0|"""I came into finance, kind of a little bit by accident."
NEUT1|I was meant to be an engineer at Engineering High School and I was very interested in it.
NEUT2|But then at one point I I thought why not follow my passion.
NEUT3|I started trading when I was 16.
NEUT4|Now manage portfolios for friends and family.
NEUT5|I started studying business and now finance at UCL.
NEUT6|Also following my passion.

NEUT8|Investing money is an intellectual game.
NEUT9|It's about risk management issue equity research.
NEUT10|It's about networking as well as it's very competitive nature.
NEUT11|It's like a professional football player.
NEUT12|He is to perform every day, every week.
NEUT13|I basically back at the same time for a digital asset hedge fund in the US, So these are quite long conference calls at night, so I have to catch up on sleep on the weekends.
NEUT14|Later at night on the weekends, we go out smoking a cigar.
NEUT15|It's very relaxing.
NEUT16|You know, it's kind of meditative and one of the hedonistic parts of my life.
NEUT17|I got into cigars when I was in Hong Kong.
NEUT18|I met the Austrian ambassadors there and Austrian students, Austrian business guys they used to smoke a lot of cigars and I joined them and then I lost it.
NEUT19|So there's no single job or not sitting single city.
