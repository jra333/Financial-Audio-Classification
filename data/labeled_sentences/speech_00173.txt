NEUT0|"""Let's talk about Palantir guys."
NEUT1|PLT or is the name what they do they do AI and data, meaning they can take your data sets.
NEUT2|They can take whatever you have and use their systems to make you make more money.
NEUT3|Pretty much that simple as that.
NEUT4|As a matter fact, the last 17 years they've been helping governments all over the world take data sets that they have and make predictive analysis help them better update their systems.
NEUT5|Be more efficient, supply chain, etc etc.
NEUT6|For the last 17 years they've been working for the government sector and now they're taking all that knowledge.
NEUT7|All that data they've built up, and the techniques that they've been using, and now helping major companies get to where they need to be.
NEUT8|For example, IBM, combining with Watson, doing some of the CRM help, or worked in the background just on a 5 year contract with BP, and they're helping 3M with their supply chain.
BULL9|But three companies a lot more you're expecting to grow themselves at 30% per year from now for the next 5 to 10 years.
BULL10|That's a big growth in this company.
NEUT11|There are industry agnostic, meaning it doesn't matter what company you're working for, no matter what company you are.
NEUT12|They can help you get better results, but they will supply chain, your customer base or working anything in the middle.
NEUT13|So industry agnostic doesn't mean if your Navy or Shell Corporation, they have something for you.
NEUT14|Personal price target.
NEUT15|Now this is the technical and fundamental analysis.
NEUT16|We're looking for $100 price target in the next 12 months.
NEUT17|A lot of people out there have it for 150 or more, but I'm comfortable with $100.
NEUT18|Because I really like pollentier and of course we do have a position.
