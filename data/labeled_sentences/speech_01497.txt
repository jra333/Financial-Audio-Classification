BULL0|"""We do have some breaking news on Occidental's bid to buy Anadarko."
NEUT1|You can add another name to this list of people who are competing in this Berkshire Hathaway committing to invest $10 billion in Occidental.
NEUT2|This is contingent on Oxy going ahead and buying Anadarko.
NEUT3|Here's the terms of the deal.
NEUT4|100,000 shares of perpetual preferred preferred stock that preferred stock comes with an 8% annual dividend.
NEUT5|Also, the warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of Oxy Common shares at 6250.
NEUT6|If you look at the last bid on Occidental, shares their trading at 63.
BULL7|43 It's up five and a half percent, I think, as this news is hitting 'cause it's higher than those shares were trading just a moment ago.
BULL8|Now the stock is up by about 6 1/2 percent.
BEAR9|There have been all sorts of concerns about whether Occidentals deal was for real, whether they were going to get the financing.
NEUT10|This makes it real.
NEUT11|It's expensive capital, though it is expensive capital very.
NEUT12|It's kind of out of the Berkshire playbook, though.
NEUT13|A preferred.
NEUT14|That's what they delivered a 15 right like this genius Bank of America.
NEUT15|Nothing that you got less for more.
NEUT16|You know we did have Dwight Scott on for Blackstone earlier this morning.
BEAR17|He was saying in the energy sector in particular, people have run from the credit there because they have not wanted to get involved in those things.
NEUT18|But this is $10 billion that would go straight towards that.
NEUT19|Let's take a look at how the other stocks are reacting as a result.
NEUT20|Anadarko look like it was up on this news too.
NEUT21|I guess the question remains, will Chevron come back in with a higher offer now or is this going to be something that Occidental walks away with it?
BEAR22|This blocks Chevron shares up by about 2% and we talked about that yesterday.
NEUT23|That's for losing.
BEAR24|That's for losing Chevron.
BEAR25|Shareholders did not like this.
BEAR26|The stock was down when they first made the announcement on this Berry.
NEUT27|So when you see chevrat up, I guess kind of solidifying the idea that they don't think Michael Worth will come back when Michael Wirth was on set with us here.
NEUT28|He said they weren't going to pay more for this.
NEUT29|I think the question remains though, how much do they want these assets?
BULL30|Because in the Permian Basin they have already been able to do a lot of scale Chevron has and it would be important to them, but obviously accidental thinks it would be very important to them as well, and a darco shares right now up by about $0.07 an again.
NEUT31|Breaking news on this is that Berkshire Hathaway is committed to investing $10 billion in Occidental, contingent on Oxy and going ahead and closing that deal with Anadarko.
NEUT32|Let's get down to the New York Stock Exchange, get to Jim Cramer and see what he thinks about this deal and McDonald's earnings this morning, Jim.
NEUT33|Let's start with breaking news first, though.
NEUT34|This battle continues game over game over.
NEUT35|Chevron walks way.
NEUT36|That's the end chevrons all play.
NEUT37|This is 2 V. Hub gets it very hard, can do alot, she's Occidental CEO and it's got a lot of property already in the Permian and I. Sluter may be expensive capital, but she obviously knows what she's doing in terms of return.
NEUT38|I know that worth love those properties, but I know he's not going to pay up so you can just say this one is finished.
BULL39|An either Chevron is going to look for another player, or Chevron is going to say OK, there's better growth away from the permit, but that's amazing.
BULL40|It's an amazing thing and I think it's noteworthy about how undervalued ox IAS.
NEUT41|Because who knows?
NEUT42|Value Becky better than Warren, right?
NEUT43|Although you know the deal he's getting is the preferred stock, but then also the common shares that have warrants on but.
NEUT44|Yeah, he thinks it's there.
NEUT45|He thinks that for a lot of persons around Vicky's paying too much you don't want to give her preferred.
NEUT46|You don't give her anything right?
BEAR47|And I think that it's there are a lot of people who felt that she was paying too much.
NEUT48|And obviously if you think that there are good enough credit risk, you given that deal cheap capital.
NEUT49|But the same time capital an endorsement.
BULL50|"I just think that it's a sign that that Hub is a lot better than a lot of people think."""
