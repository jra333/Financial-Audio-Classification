NEUT1|Jim Kramer joins us.
NEUT2|Now, let's talk big tech.
NEUT3|Which ones do you like?
NEUT4|Which ones don't you like?
NEUT5|We're going to be talking to the CFO of Twitter in just a moment.
BEAR6|I think net is being sold short here.
NEUT7|I think that yes, they didn't have the right number of daily average user.
BEAR8|I wasn't happy with the users that nobody else was.
BULL9|However, I mean the franchise is intact.
NEUT10|I don't know how they did 20 million and one that's kind of strange.
NEUT11|You have to ask him that, but I do think that they.
NEUT12|That the second half could be better, but it's not my favorite.
NEUT13|My favorite alphabet where they they really hit it out of the park and they gave you a lot more guidance.
NEUT14|They give you a sense of how great YouTube is.
BULL15|I really feel like that that company is finally coming in on the cloud.
BULL16|Thomas Curry and doing amazing job search is so good that once again I think going to be in front of the government.
NEUT17|I liked Apple.
NEUT18|Call me a dreamer.
NEUT19|I think that this was not the quarter that you're going to have 5G at snacks.
NEUT20|If you sell Apple you don't believe in 5G.
BULL21|Facebook was awesome.
NEUT22|I don't know what the problem was in Amazon.
NEUT23|Yes, they hired a lot of people in Oh my.
NEUT24|They decide to spend one safety.
NEUT25|Should we blast them?
BULL26|I think it was a great thing.
BULL27|So I guess in some I like them if they're taking down the market then we got a chance.
NEUT28|I think it's Kovid and the election that's taking down the market and that all these were actually pretty good except for we have to find out about Twitter and maybe Ned's got a better story.
BULL29|He's a great guy.
NEUT30|I didn't really get even after speaking with him.
BULL31|It's hard to rationalize, but it's a great franchise.
NEUT32|We're going to talk about Jim if you could only own one stock.
NEUT33|One of the ones we just mentioned.
NEUT34|Which one do you own?
NEUT35|Alphabet OK. Shepard Smith here.
