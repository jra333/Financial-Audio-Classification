BULL0|"""The pound is moving on up."
BULL1|No real surprise why the EU referendum is less than a month away, and opinion polls are showing a clear lead for the Remain campaign that's having an instant impact on Sterling.
BEAR2|The pound has been volatile all year and not just because of the Brexit debate.
NEUT3|Other factors such as economic data, the dollars direction and rate rise expectations have influenced.
NEUT4|Its moves both against the dollar.
NEUT5|And the euro.
NEUT6|But up until June the 23rd, it's going to be all about Brexit and those polls.
NEUT7|So is the market more bullish about the Remain camp prevailing on June 23rd?
BEAR8|Far from it all year, the Sterling options market has been in a state of flux, as investors worry about being on the wrong side of a steep fall in the pound.
BEAR9|If the UK votes to leave the EU, the latest data shows investors continuing to take.
BEAR10|Out options to protect themselves from the kind of big fall many economists predict Sterling will suffer if the UK does vote to leave the EU.
NEUT11|Do these investors know something?
NEUT12|Others don't?
NEUT13|That's doubtful.
NEUT14|What it does show is how nervous the next few weeks are likely to be.
NEUT15|"You have to have total trust in those opinion polls to be confident about the outcome and the market clearly does not."""
