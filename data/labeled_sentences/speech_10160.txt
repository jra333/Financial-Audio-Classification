NEUT0|"""What's up everybody."
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
NEUT2|Hope you guys are having a fantastic day and before I could start with this one they quickly mention once again they have the link to my discord in the scription where I have over 900 members and we have a great community in there so feel free to join and check that out if you haven't already, but other than that let's get right into this video from today's video only going over Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.
BEAR3|Their ticker symbol is Baba and as you can see they're selling off against either down negative, 4.32% or $10.79 down to a total of $229.40.
NEUT4|They have been in the news a lot recently.
BEAR5|Guys if you take a look at the three month chart you can see there down pretty badly over 20% or about $58 in just the past three months.
BULL6|Back in October, on October 27th they did reach a high of $317.14.
BEAR7|Ever since that high they did receive a bunch of negative news.
BEAR8|They had some bad news come out about their IPO, an IPL that they had a 33% stake and the Chinese regulators investigating them.
NEUT9|They had the listing rumors they had their CEO Jack MA just recently not making a public appearance and things like that.
NEUT10|So just lots of uncertainty.
NEUT11|Lots of lots of things to be worried about.
NEUT12|If you're an Alibaba investor particularly.
BEAR13|The reason behind this massive drop that we just had for about $236.00 or way down to about 2:28, it's because this article came out stating that the US is considering adding Alibaba to Chinese stock ban has been developing for some time, but as you can see, U.S. officials are considering prohibiting Americans from investing in Alibaba, so obviously not great news there.
NEUT14|They are going to be selling off.
BULL15|I do expect them to sell off even more tomorrow, and if we go to break them down here on the daily chart on thinkorswim.
NEUT16|You can see what I mean.
BEAR17|They're pretty flat right here on the view up, and then they just had this massive one minute candle that brought them all way down from about 235 all way down to 229.
BEAR18|They reached a low down here at two 2586 our site at that time was about 6:00 or 8, which is pretty ridiculous.
BEAR19|You could have bought calls right there even though it was risky just to play this small bounce back to the Ma, you can see the Mackie has crossed back up so they could be seeing a lower relief rally right here, but I do expect them to be pushed back down to this lower view at $227.00.
BEAR20|And $0.24 if you break them down on 180 day chart right here you can see that they do look pretty bad if I go ahead and zoom in on this section you can see they have just gotten rejected off the 50 MA, which is this white line right here.
BEAR21|The Mac D looks like it's going to cross down, which does indicate a bearish reversal and expect them pull back even more.
NEUT22|Maybe retest the lows.
BULL23|About $216.82, particularly chart.
NEUT24|You can see pretty much the same thing.
BULL25|A strong rejection and a downtrend.
NEUT26|I'll go ahead and zoom in on this section.
NEUT27|You can see we can reject it on the 9 ma right here.
BULL28|Mcdee does look a little bit better.
NEUT29|On this time frame, and this isn't really all this delisting news obviously isn't good, but this isn't really something that's going to be effective immediately, so this isn't really a huge concern.
NEUT30|I mean, it is obviously something to be worried about as an investor, and I wouldn't recommend buying shares or things like that despite the bargain at $231, because this is a Chinese company in the government does back then, so I don't really expect them to just to go to zero or anything crazy like that.
BEAR31|And if they aren't available on US exchanges, obviously that's just not good news.
NEUT32|So like any like I said guys.
NEUT33|If anything, maybe just trade some puts.
NEUT34|Some long term puts.
NEUT35|I recommend doing or maybe the January 29th puts.
NEUT36|Take a look at these you can see here on this option change the tuition $30 put right here is going to cost you $963 up front.
BULL37|Obviously this is now up 63 1/2% on a day or $378 has a Delta 46 at 8 of 21.
BULL38|So pretty good ratio here.
NEUT39|There isn't the most volume or open interest, so you probably could find some more of that if you go closer closer expiration.
NEUT40|Other than that guys that is about it for this video.
NEUT41|If you're new here, please do subscribe to my channel and as I mentioned I have the link to my discord in description.
NEUT42|As well as my Robin Hood for Lincoln is always guys.
BULL43|"Thank you so much for watching and I will see you all in the next one."""
