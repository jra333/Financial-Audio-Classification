NEUT13|So let's take a look at UC.
NEUT14|Oh yes, I know what you see.
NEUT15|Oh, it's basically like the crude oil ETF.
NEUT16|Yes, can read about it.
NEUT17|I actually own one share.
NEUT18|You can see that I bought it when it was like around $12.50 and I've made a profit of $16.57, which is not that bad.
NEUT19|But if we look at this, how did this one go from being 2000?
BEAR20|Almost $2200 to as low as literally well within $11.00.
NEUT21|How is that even possible?
NEUT22|Please understand this guys.
NEUT23|First of all, this had a reverse split because I know it's a reverse split.
BEAR24|I personally find them a little annoying.
NEUT25|OK if you're a beginner you don't know what this is, that's great.
NEUT26|Let me explain to you what they are so you don't get confused like I did when I was a beginner.
NEUT27|So Iris plate is basically when.
NEUT28|The Founders company, whatever you want to call it, they decide you know what we're going to make, the value of our stock, but this is an ETF.
NEUT29|OK, whatever it is, let's use stock for example.
NEUT30|When they say look, our stock is, let's say it's $5 OK and they don't like it.
NEUT31|You know what we're going to increase it to $20.
NEUT32|OK, so now the reverse split is going to be a ratio of 12144 if that makes any sense.
NEUT33|So you're not going to make money.
BULL34|You're not going to lose money, but now the value just went up, even though you bought it at $5.
NEUT35|Now you only own 1/4 of that, if that makes any sense.
NEUT36|OK, just keep in mind you don't make any money.
NEUT37|You don't profit.
BEAR38|You don't lose money from this, and that's one of the main reasons why you see, oh, it went from $2000 all the way to as low as $11.00.
NEUT39|So if you look at it right now, you might be thinking, wow, this is great, but actually no.
NEUT40|OK, so in 2011 they actually had a ratio of 1 for four, so they changed it.
NEUT41|In May 20th, 2015, they also had another reverse split of a ratio of 1 for five and back in 2017 they had another 1142 and it wasn't until literally a couple months ago, April 21st, 2020.
NEUT42|They did a reverse split of one for 25, so that's one of the main reasons why you see.
NEUT43|It's like what it used to be.
NEUT44|$2000 now is just $29.00.
NEUT45|Don't get mixed up with that guys.
NEUT46|OK, it can get a little confusing, but just keep in mind that.
NEUT47|That's not how much it really is, you know.
NEUT48|They they move the numbers here and there, but let me know down in the comments section below.
NEUT49|If you guys think this is definitely your by, but I hope you guys enjoy.
