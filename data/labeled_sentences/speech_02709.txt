NEUT0|"""Person how you modeling the second quarter GDP hit."
NEUT1|Yeah, so this is of course incredibly complicated, but in terms of the impact for the labor market, I mean, we've been looking at some of the daily data from Homebase.
BEAR2|Homebase is a service that provides scheduling and payroll services to small businesses, and they have a survey of over all the companies that they work with, which is about 60,000 companies and that shows the day by day that we've seen gradual layoffs.
BEAR3|If hourly workers and in fact if you look at the numbers today, the amount of hourly workers that are working red since January is 50% lower.
NEUT4|So at the nationwide level is about 80 million hourly workers.
BULL5|So overall, the impact on GDP is going to be very similar and very significant.
BEAR6|And what this could overall imply is that you could see the unemployment rate in the worst case jump as much as 10 percentage points in the US, which of course would be a very bad scenario.
NEUT7|And what does that do to GDP Torsten?
BEAR8|So that of course pushes GDP down quite hard here in the second quarter.
BEAR9|The numbers, of course, that we've been looking at have been fuselier function of with the lock down last one month with a large found last two months in China you saw in Q1 GDP go down 50% from quarter over quarter.
NEUT10|So now we expand.
BEAR11|The lockdown lasted roughly in Wuhan about 50 days.
NEUT12|So if you do that simple modeling exercise and go back to your spreadsheet and ask what does that mean for US GDP and for European GDP?
NEUT13|If we were a little bit later in terms in European euros in terms of responding and if the lock down also lasts about.
BEAR14|"Between one and two months you also get to that the impact on GDP quarter or quarter in Q1 and not annualized rate, but just qo Q could be down as much as 2030%, which of course is enormous."""
