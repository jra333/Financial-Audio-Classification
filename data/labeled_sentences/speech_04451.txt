NEUT0|"""I mean, when you get these theme parks open, they remember they did restructuring this company."
NEUT1|During this.
BULL2|I think the profitability of this is going to be remarkable.
NEUT3|Happy birthday, but I played birthday Bob Eiger yesterday and I think that when you're going to see is it just going to make so much more money per person that you're going to be staggered at how of what this company is going to be able to do.
NEUT4|They have taken advantage of a very difficult time for them and really reinvented the company called.
BULL5|I think it's going to be remarkable.
NEUT6|I remember we used to send your account number of ESPN.
NEUT7|You know they can get really amazing.
NEUT8|That's not part of the conversation any longer.
NEUT9|I don't think they will get rid of ESPN, at least in the near term.
NEUT10|There may be some moves they make in terms of the Ono's or something like that, or even ABC Network.
NEUT11|I don't know.
NEUT12|But Jim, you're right, it's all about direct to consumer.
NEUT13|It's all about the focus of the company.
NEUT14|Although when the parks reopen and people actually start going to movie theaters again, that won't be a bad thing, for this is going to be huge now, but now at $345 billion, market value is the reopening already taken.
NEUT15|Count up in that stock price, but not if you have a roaring 20s feud.
NEUT16|It's going to be years where the bookings, so I think it's not a quarter.
NEUT17|I think it's you know people are going to be booking for 2023.
BULL18|I think that's what's going to happen if you hadn't told anybody at the beginning of this horrible pandemic that Disney stock would be up 100% or whatever.
NEUT19|The number is from the low.
BEAR20|Their theme parks have been operating at far less the capacity, if in fact they do.
NEUT21|They allowed to be open right?
NEUT22|Californians?
NEUT23|Metal globe.
NEUT24|It's amazing and nobody would be what going to movies in your world that people work with.
BULL25|Brilliant Disney Plus ended up.
NEUT26|Yes it's considered.
NEUT27|I mean, it's Netflix and obviously you know for a while we were looking at the two in terms of market value, just as awake as Netflix was larger than Disney for some period of time and they were very close.
NEUT28|"Now Disney is $100 billion larger than Netflix, but they are the two dominant providers when it."""
