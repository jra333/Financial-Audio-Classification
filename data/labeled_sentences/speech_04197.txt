NEUT0|"""Hey fools, Mike Fenaroli here with the incredibly handsome mark wreath of consumer goods and so Mark Rite Aid shares Goldman Sachs."
NEUT1|Basically the last couple of days.
BULL2|Upgraded Rite Aid raised the target price.
NEUT3|Tell us a little bit more about what's going on.
BULL4|So like you said, Goldman Sachs gave Brighton upgrade.
BULL5|They boost it from neutral to buy and they upped the price target to $8.00 and a lot of this was predicated on Rite Aid's turn around.
NEUT6|Specifically, they're cleaning up their balance sheet a little bit of history lesson for you.
NEUT7|From 2010 to about 2012, or Rite Aid really, really suffering.
BULL8|I've got a great number here.
BEAR9|They suffered a total net loss of $1.4 billion.
NEUT10|Ouch, very big.
NEUT11|Ouch, but last year they actually kind of turned that around a bit.
BULL12|They made $118 million, which is not a huge amount, but it's a good sign of a turn around.
NEUT13|And Goldman Sachs is saying that the turn around is going to continue, right?
BEAR14|So in light of this upgrade, though, these numbers, even though I get the turn around happening, they don't look very strong.
NEUT15|What's your take, right?
NEUT16|So Rite Aid released its February.
BEAR17|Sales figures and they didn't look great.
BEAR18|Their front end retail sales, their comps were down about 1.8%, so there's an easy argument for the Bears out there that the turn around isn't quite here yet, right?
BEAR19|I think that front end retail decline is actually offset though by their pharmacy sales, which were up something like 3.1% year over year.
NEUT20|That was another thing that Goldman Sachs cited in this research.
NEUT21|Note that the pharmacy is where Rite Aid strengths really going to lie, especially as new reforms to health care laws come out.
NEUT22|One of the things Goldman Sachs specifically said is that Rite Aid stores, I believe 65% of Rite Aid locations are in states where Medicaid is going to be drastically improved.
BULL23|Medicare excuse me compared to 54% for Walgreen and 47% for CVS, so they have a bit of an edge on the competition there.
BULL24|As far as being able to profit from these changes in health care, right?
BULL25|Might might provide a little bit of a tailwind.
NEUT26|Absolutely all important question.
NEUT27|Now, are you buying Rite Aid shares?
NEUT28|I am buying Rite Aid shares.
NEUT29|I think that as more people come to Rite Aid pharmacies like I said, there's reason for that more people will start to pick up their groceries while they're there.
BULL30|So I think the front end is going to be improved at the end of the day, that growth, combined with widespread store revamping and they're still cleaning up their balance sheet, still closing underperforming stores.
NEUT31|I think all of that really adds up for Rite Aid.
BULL32|It makes it a very positive by for me, right?
BULL33|OK, well, thank you very much.
