NEUT0|"""Let's go on to the next company, but this one is a rare company you've never heard of them."
NEUT1|It's called Apple L. Well, here we go, market cap of two point 1 gajillion.
NEUT2|And what is the PE ratio?
NEUT3|But now it's expensive.
NEUT4|It's 38 and this does matter with Apple 'cause they've always been making a lot of money, so it's not.
NEUT5|I don't look at this thing to myself.
BEAR6|Well, maybe they had a big write off.
NEUT7|No?
NEUT8|This is Apple.
NEUT9|They make a ton of money.
BULL10|Profit margin for Apple, 19.6% Check Mark.
NEUT11|Pillar #3 is revenue growth over the past five years.
NEUT12|I'm guessing it's always awesome.

BEAR15|275 Massive check profit growth is pulled #445.7 to.
NEUT16|57 Check mark their kids do member shares outstanding shares outstanding Pillar #5 so guys.
NEUT17|My guess is Apple is going to use a lot of their free cash flow to buy a lot of buy.
NEUT18|A lot of shares back instead of paying a dividend own.
NEUT19|By the way 'cause that's it is a better way.
NEUT20|It's a more tax effective way for Apple to give money back to their investors.
NEUT21|It's a check mark here on shares outstanding school current assets greater than current liabilities, which is pillar number 6.0 My Lord one $44 billion.
BEAR22|In cash in 105 and current liabilities, that's $40 billion less, or $40 billion.
NEUT23|More current assets and current liabilities assets.
NEUT24|A check mark there massive check mark.
BULL25|Free cash flow growth pull over the past five years right peanut you're ready.
NEUT26|So 54 fifty 260-459-7273 point 73 at the check mark there.
NEUT27|What's the average 60 times?
NEUT28|Let's keep it in 20.
NEUT29|If it's 21.2 trillion, it's currently at 2.1 trillion.
BEAR30|He's a drop by 4540% call.
NEUT31|It's actually 45% in the stocks currently at 1:35, so we need to stock it.
NEUT32|But what?
NEUT33|80 bucks?
NEUT34|I'm a buyer of the stock around 8 hours or that's what I think the value is for the company.
NEUT35|But $8.00 a share?
NEUT36|You look at minimum.
NEUT37|Yeah, where did crossover baby so across back at the end of 2019 at around $60.00 a share.
NEUT38|If you bought them goodbye double your money right now.
NEUT39|Well over double your money right now so it works in and sometimes it doesn't work.
NEUT40|'cause look right here, if you sold right here when it went below you sold at 50 and then you bought back up at 60.
NEUT41|So you've been waiting here.
NEUT42|And then yeah, so it still depends.
BULL43|I mean going back further, you've been more money, but Apple's also been on a clip.
NEUT44|Complete a prize.
NEUT45|I don't like using Apple.
NEUT46|Very rarely.
NEUT47|"The companies do this kind of growth."""
