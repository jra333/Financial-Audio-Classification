BULL0|"""The gold prices had a nice run, but it has not been smooth, having risen to 1350 per oz."
BEAR1|In April 2018, gold sunk below 1200 by August 2018, then go prices rose above 1300.
NEUT2|By March 2019, took a breather and pressed onward to pass through 1400.
NEUT3|In the summer of 2019.
NEUT4|There is plenty of controversy about what drives the gold price, global tensions, portfolio diversification, production costs, demand from China or central banks, etc.
NEUT5|All these factors matter.
NEUT6|However, our research suggests that currently the one most important factor is the direction of interest rates in the United States.
BULL7|Having risen to 1350 in April 2018, the realization that the Fed was on a path to keep raising rates, possibly through 2019.
BEAR8|That's what sunk goal to below 1200 in August of 2018.
NEUT9|It was not until the Fed let it be known that it was going to halt its relentless stepwise rate rise program back in late 2018.
NEUT10|The goal moved from 1200 to 1300.
BULL11|And again in the spring and summer of 2019, it was the Fed signal that it was willing to cut rates that ignited the rally that brought gold over 1400 pounds.
NEUT12|This interpretation that gold is now predominantly rate driven comes with some interesting suggestions.
BULL13|First, for gold prices to head to 1600 or higher, it will take a few more rate cuts from the Fed.
BEAR14|Two global tensions still matter for gold, but with the trade war in play, global tensions are now correlated with economic expectations and thus rates.
BULL15|That is, a worsening of tensions leads to a decelerating growth, and then the rate cuts, which is good for gold prices.
BULL16|Well, it's unlikely anytime soon despite continued US China trade talks and into the trade war would raise global growth expectations bring back the possibility of rate hikes and that wouldn't be so good for gold.
NEUT17|3rd, If you buy the first two points, then gold is probably not nearly as beneficial for portfolio diversification as it once was.
