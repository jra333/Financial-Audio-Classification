NEUT0|"""Alright, well now to our last real real deal."
NEUT1|Facebook is hiring social networking company looking for nearly 1200 new employees based on the available jobs, it appears the company is trying to become more than just a social networking site.
NEUT2|Last year, Facebook acquiring Oculus Rift, that is the maker of the virtual reality headsets.
NEUT3|$2 billion is what they pay for that company.
BEAR4|According to the company's website, it wants to hire more than 50 jobs in that particular unit.
NEUT5|Not all Facebook trying to build its own satellites, its own drones capable of delivering Internet service to remote regions.
NEUT6|Around the world.
NEUT7|So Hillary will Facebook become the go to.
NEUT8|In other words, you get social and then you get everything that Google is off right now.
NEUT9|Well, Facebook is certainly trying to do that, but it's difficult.
NEUT10|The good news for Facebook though, is these kinds of investments are really insignificant in comparison to their advertising revenue and their core business, right?
NEUT11|So what do you think Matt would buy or not?
NEUT12|I like it.
NEUT13|You look at how much they get a revenue per employee.
NEUT14|Facebook right now.
NEUT15|384 thousand Google 183 thousand.
NEUT16|So they get a lot out of each employee.
BULL17|Great if you had more workforce.
BULL18|That number dropped, but I think they're doing the right thing.
NEUT19|I mean I it took them a while to get moving.
NEUT20|Once there publicly traded companies now realize any diversify a bit there.
NEUT21|Almost a Google of 10 years ago 'cause Google related.
NEUT22|Diversify Facebook's doing the same thing to bring on smart people.
NEUT23|This much rather own Facebook stock today versus Google.
NEUT24|You know, at any point I very much agree with very bad on that point.
NEUT25|And also I think what they did with Instagram back in 2012 they paid a billion dollars which everybody at the time it was crazy.
BULL26|And by any by certain analysts expectations, Instagram now is worth probably 12 to 14 times that number and it's allowing them to keep customers.
NEUT27|Keep users that Facebook either wouldn't have lost or wouldn't attracted, so their acquisition strategy.
NEUT28|They really using their stock value to their to their advantage in the Holy Grail for them seems to be we want to be your homepage.
NEUT29|We want to be just that go through spot.
NEUT30|So we got, I think through acquisitions I. I'm a big believer right now.
NEUT31|What Facebook is doing well and let's take a page from Joanie Courtney's playbook.
BULL32|But when you see a company growing at this level and hiring at the level that they're growing at that means growth for the company.
NEUT33|So I mean and you're going to see again this sector if Facebook is growing at this level, hiring all these people, other social media stocks are probably going to get on board as well, and as far as this virtual reality hotter and hotter, right?
NEUT34|Facebook is not the only one investing, so that says something for surgeons.
NEUT35|There's gaming usage is.
NEUT36|I mean, there's a lot of different applications.
NEUT37|Yeah, I think they went without less about the glass glass hole and more about the gaming, which I think has a probably a little bit more applicability.
NEUT38|For the virtual reality also their I guess their Internet access is a project that they are very passionate about and they will benefit throughout again there.
NEUT39|So it's pretty cool, right?
NEUT40|So they can grow Rd here that people don't have Internet.
NEUT41|They need more.
NEUT42|"They would put the satellites up and beam into place with Internet and we're going to log into Facebook, get more users, get more users right from the pool."""
