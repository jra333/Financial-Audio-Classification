NEUT0|"""Age claim this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR3|Well, a rough day on this one as the price rolled back over after attempting to make a move to the upside.
NEUT4|But as I talked about in the previous video, you always gotta be careful.
NEUT5|Those dead cat bounces were, you know, just because something starts to go back up does not mean that the prices reversing or anything like that.
BEAR6|And at this point I'm it's looking like the action from the past couple of days was just simply a dead cat bounce.
NEUT7|So let's get some key levels mapped out now here as we head into Friday first.
NEUT8|Key dynamic here and update is just based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below.
NEUT9|They tend to act as resistance, so we're going another day.
NEUT10|That 122 mark wasn't area of support with the price now breaking down blow up that would be considered an area of resistance.
BEAR11|In fact, you can see that a couple of times this afternoon the price tried to get up above it right there.
NEUT12|And both those times that is right where the price was rejected.
NEUT13|So at this point I'm not saying that at 122 can never be broken or anything like that.
NEUT14|I'm just saying, you know, it makes sense why the price is struggling at that area.
NEUT15|So keep a close eye on that.
NEUT16|If the price can get up there and breakthrough the 122 mark next key area of resistance after that would then be that purple line right there.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Moving average which is actually right where the price got rejected from this morning.
NEUT19|So want to keep a close eye on that, but also don't get too far ahead of yourselves.
NEUT20|Let's just first see if the price can even break up above that 122 mark.
NEUT21|Now if the price decides it wants to keep on moving downwards.
NEUT22|First, the area of support to watch closely going to be right there at the 1:20 fifty mark, and then after that next level, not until down there around 1:18.
BULL23|Fifty so overall.
NEUT24|Yeah the downtrend continues, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around and not moving forward.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL28|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT34|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT37|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT38|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT39|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
