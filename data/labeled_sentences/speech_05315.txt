BULL0|"""Let's take a look at NIO because over the last two days the stock price is up over 25%."
NEUT1|Can this continue?
NEUT2|What's causing this?
NEUT3|Let's take a look at their chart and use some technical analysis tools to determine what is next.
NEUT4|Jumping right in here.
NEUT5|As you can see, the last few days kind of just jumped up to big jumps.
NEUT6|Let's take a look.
NEUT7|In place some lines of resistance here and support.
NEUT8|So we know.
BEAR9|Here some support here and resistance pretty much all these are going to be supports because the stock price is above these levels.
NEUT10|But just to make sure the stock price is not going to go down.
NEUT11|Place them here.
NEUT12|Mark, this is all green.
NEUT13|Here.
NEUT14|And I'm going to skip around here.
NEUT15|OK, I don't want to use another tool called the Fibonacci extension.
NEUT16|To map out to see if we have any extra.
NEUT17|Learnings we can have.
NEUT18|What's need is this one.
NEUT19|We see this at the top here.
NEUT20|So we we did Swing Lotus when I try to swing low actually generates this propagates.
NEUT21|Use these levels.
NEUT22|We actually see this is actually pretty very pretty close to overseeing at this resistance here.
NEUT23|Let's see if we see anything else with.
NEUT24|This tax when load is in high position between load swing high because.
NEUT25|Could you see some more here?
NEUT26|Potential resistance?
NEUT27|No.
NEUT28|Switch this here.
NEUT29|Lips.
NEUT30|Properties.
NEUT31|You don't need all these levels really, it's just extra.
NEUT32|Extra stuff.
BULL33|So potentially we can see two big resistance is going forward here.
BULL34|Pretty much 21 and a half dollars and $21 pretty much knew that we're going to have resistance at this top also.
BEAR35|2097 because its all time high and it got rejected off of that.
BULL36|So potentially tomorrow maybe we see another bounce.
BULL37|'cause we do see this resistant or support getting bounced back over it.
BEAR38|Got kind of bounced off of this twice, so potentially on the open will see a move upwards.
NEUT39|Obviously if we move keep moving up.
BULL40|See if we have any additional ones, but we do have some some room to run potentially, although it's getting all the way up to 24 1/2 and 20 almost 2475.
BULL41|Before we have some more resistance, so it'll be interesting and IO had a quite a big run kind of fueled by this battery on demand services, so you know test is doing pretty hot right now, and so this is kind of getting piggybacked onto their success, but.
NEUT42|You know, obviously they have their right of their own, so potentially this game should be a big stock in the future with with all the battery services that they're going to offer.
NEUT43|Thanks guys for watching but remember to like and subscribe for any more technical stock analysis.
