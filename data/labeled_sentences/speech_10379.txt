NEUT0|"""And Jim, you know some of the high frequency numbers that we track have been rolling over in September, chase card spending, open table diners airline traffic."
NEUT1|As you said, hotel occupancy Apple Mobility data and then you top that off with what Bostick said this morning.
NEUT2|And that is that there are signs of the economy slowing as the summer boom sort of wanes, Jim again leading back to that discussion of what Congress should or needs to do.
NEUT3|I, I totally agree that these are very big issues and I gotta tell you if your.
NEUT4|Lever to international and in the airline business is as United is.
NEUT5|There's a tremendous amount of business they have, and you know there's a lot of countries that won't take us.
NEUT6|Maybe I don't know if people realize.
NEUT7|If you're going to go to Spain your visa.
NEUT8|OK, we're going to go to Italy.
NEUT9|Forget about it.
NEUT10|Even if you have a business there, a wine business in olive oil business, you can't do it.
NEUT11|And then you know when you have a lot of business.
NEUT12|Travel will like Delta, has an American.
BEAR13|It's not coming back.
NEUT14|That's why people like Southwest Air now, 'cause they feel it's.
NEUT15|You know better as a leisure play, but I'm not.
NEUT16|I'm not particularly sanguine about how the airlines are doing here.
BEAR17|It's not coming back the way I thought it would.
NEUT18|Just not.
NEUT19|Are you concerned Jim as well?
NEUT20|This discussion yesterday?
BEAR21|Yeah, go ahead Carl, sorry as we watch the no.
NEUT22|I'm just saying as the executives were, hat in hand at the White House 24 hours ago.
NEUT23|They need help.
NEUT24|I think that they should go back to the old deal that they had.
NEUT25|You know, I spoke yesterday at Grant.
NEUT26|Seems to be no go but I really do feel that we have to be careful of a second wave.
NEUT27|We have to be careful of what I look at the colleges numbers every single day in New York Times and this business travel.
NEUT28|If your if your company was based on business travel.
BEAR29|Your company is going to miss the numbers big and I really feel that way, and it's something we've got to watch.
NEUT30|Yeah, that was going to be my question, Jim.
NEUT31|I think there is.
BEAR32|There's got to be some concern about a second wave to a certain extent, we've been low for a long time.
NEUT33|For example here in this part of the country, but it doesn't mean you stay that way.
NEUT34|Just you know, again, as temperatures start to cool, people are indoors more.
NEUT35|Perhaps you have to.
NEUT36|"You have to worry about that, I would assume."""
