NEUT0|"""Guys, if you guys still don't understand the SLR, the supplemental leverage ratio, it's also known as the tier one leverage ratio."
NEUT1|I wanted to explain it in 60 seconds.
NEUT2|Let's say that you own things.
NEUT3|Let's say you own your house on Stonks, right?
NEUT4|You might own bonds.
NEUT5|And of course you own cash, right?
NEUT6|This cash is the most liquid out of your assets.
NEUT7|Let's assume that there's also cash like assets that you have.
NEUT8|Those are all tier one assets that you have.
NEUT9|The tier one ratio there is.
NEUT10|Comparing how well would you handle a financial crisis, right?
NEUT11|Let's if you had cash, you would be able to turn that around and put it into places like debts and liabilities that you need to cover for.
BEAR12|However, if he didn't have enough of this and had too much of this, you are now under leveraged in our dangerous position to get screwed over by a financial crisis.
NEUT13|Now this rule originally had temporarily before the pandemic knocked out pieces of the denominator, trillions of dollars from the denominator, and if you guys know anything about ratios, this number gets bigger.
NEUT14|That means that this number doesn't have to be as big, so people didn't need as much cash on hand.
NEUT15|This gave people the opportunity to lend and find other people who wanted to borrow homes and stuff like that, right?
BULL16|This gave the economy a boost.
NEUT17|However, that is ending on March 31st today and now these are back on the denominator.
BEAR18|Trillions of dollars are going to have to be added here in order to keep the ratio the same, and we're likely going to see some sell offs coming on soon.
