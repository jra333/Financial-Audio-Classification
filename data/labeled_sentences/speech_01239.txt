BULL0|"""Shares of Zoom meeting a new high in this session that stock up about 4% with just about an hour left to go in the trading day after a bullish call from Bernstein, raising its price target from two $611.00 from 228."
NEUT1|Let's bring in Dan Hally for the very latest on that analyst report and and this comes is Zoom introduces some new features for users.
BULL2|Yeah, that's right, this price target increase again of lopping from.
BEAR3|$228.00 to $611.00.
NEUT4|This is obviously on that news from zooms investor conference.
NEUT5|Basically talked about the new features that they're going to roll out, including finally end to end encryption.
NEUT6|That's a huge deal, but really, you know, this price target initially, that $220 was far lower than what the stock is actually trading at, and there still is, according to Zane Crain over at Brownstein, more runway basically talking about how there's those 12,000 companies that are customers of zoom but don't pay.
NEUT7|That $10,000 limit for having a certain number of employees using the service.
NEUT8|So it's obvious that this is going to continue to be a service that's important, especially as we don't see any end to these kind of stay at home orders or office is not opening up for some time.
NEUT9|It will continue to be an issue and zoom will be at the forefront of this for some time.
NEUT10|OK, and I know you'll be watching that very very closely for us.
BULL11|"Thanks so much for that, Dan."""
