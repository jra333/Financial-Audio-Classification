NEUT0|"""All told, there's a price I'd be willing to pay for an well, but it's nowhere near the IPO."
NEUT1|What happened?
BEAR2|It's just nowhere near the IPO price of 18, which I liked.
NEUT3|There was a $4.15 billion company, but when it finally opened at 1:00 PM was trading North of 25.
NEUT4|At those levels, it was really a $6 billion company.
NEUT5|Different animal if we assume the company ends up going into 70% clip this year, then right now animals trading at roughly 21 times this year's sales member, there's like 25 of those companies, and I think they're too expensive.
BULL6|Just similar valuation to highfliers like Twilio, DocuSign Fiber and a lot more expensive than Teladoc.
NEUT7|The closest comparison which trades at 16 times sales.
NEUT8|The way I see it at 21 times sales animals trading like you can keep putting up COVID-19 style number revenues forever.
NEUT9|But maybe that could be true, but if so, it's already baked in at these levels so it's too rich for me.
NEUT10|The bottom line I like him well the company.
NEUT11|But if you buy the stock right here, you're betting that the pandemic is going to stick around for a lot longer than many think.
NEUT12|Or the digital reimbursement rates won't be lowered again when the virus goes away.
NEUT13|My view if you want to own this one, you have to let it come in because it's too hot right now.
NEUT14|I would be more bullish if you gotta pull back to the mid to high teens, watch where it came it was it was offered, but for the moment though, you know what you gotta do.
NEUT15|You gotta keep your bat on your shoulder until we get better prices.
