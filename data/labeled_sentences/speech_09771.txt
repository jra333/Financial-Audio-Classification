BULL0|"""Is full of TV co-founder and CEO David Gandler David Good Morning and wow I mean the stock is up 21% today at the moment what's been driving this."
NEUT1|Is this the stay at home void this sports and I can get them on on Fubo TV.
NEUT2|Yeah well look I think Fubo sits at the intersection of three megatrends.
BEAR3|The first is the secular decline of television viewership.
NEUT4|II is the shift of TV ad dollars to connected devices.
NEUT5|And third, the fact that Fubo has over 50,000 sporting events in this platform.
NEUT6|We also sit at the intersection of wagering as well.
BULL7|So we have 3 mega trends and clearly we're excited about it.
BULL8|And you know, we're happy to see investors notice it.
NEUT9|Which one of those trends is the most critical for you right now?
NEUT10|And to what extent are people asking you about whether you run headlong into ESPN at some point, or if you're just an entirely different animal?
NEUT11|No look we are or virtual me PD.
NEUT12|You know our job right now is to really focus on video.
BULL13|No, it's a dual revenue stream of video and advertising and you know, we've done a great job.
NEUT14|Third quarter monetizing our sub base.
BULL15|We grow market share significantly and you know, we've raised guidance higher so I don't.
NEUT16|I don't foresee any issues.
BULL17|We were strong partners with all of our media partners with Disney and NB C as well as Fox and others so.
NEUT18|We monetize their content.
NEUT19|We give them access to data on the platform.
NEUT20|We think it's a.
BULL21|It's a very solid relationship.
NEUT22|It's one that we think will continue going forward and talk again about which of those trends and drivers you mentioned is the most important.
NEUT23|I know that you mentioned the wagering gambling market that in a way makes me think about Robin Hood and its impact on the financial markets.
NEUT24|Is there sort of a wagering and financial stake impact on sports viewing?
NEUT25|Along the same vein?
BULL26|Yeah, look what we've said to investors during our Roadshow was that you know we're going to be focused on enhancing our our video experience and you know, clearly you've seen companies trying step in and use interactivity to create more engagement.
NEUT27|We think wagering obviously for a group like ours, which skews so heavily towards sports viewers that it makes sense.
BULL28|And we think that's an angle that that will drive more engagement, which ultimately will drive more viewership which will result in more monetization.
BULL29|Through advertising, so for us it's really the core business of video and advertising, and again we've done a pretty good job upselling customers.
BULL30|We sold roughly 800,000 attachments in the third quarter and so wagering is it one more revenue stream that we think will be able to add to our poor service to really enhance that and also obviously drive profitability.
NEUT31|Well, David, it's quite a chart.
NEUT32|Quite a story.
NEUT33|A lot of people trying to figure out if this might be the next Netflix in a way, but we hope you'll come back and tell that story more.
BULL34|Thank you for having me and happy Holidays.
NEUT35|Happy Holidays.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
