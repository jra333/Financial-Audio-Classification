NEUT0|"""During the Saturday just gone, Warren Buffet released his much anticipated annual review."
NEUT1|Buffet has been one of the pinnacles of the investment world for the last 50 years, and he shared his wisdom for everyone to learn from over his lifetime.
BULL2|He has built one of the largest conglomerates, Berkshire Hathaway, which has averaged a 20% rate of compounding, nearly doubled the rate of the S&P 500.
BEAR3|Now over the last few years, the company's rate of growth has been relatively weaker compared to its Heights a couple decades ago.
BEAR4|During the latter, while Buffet hinted at the slight underperformance, he seemed to believe that the market was vastly underestimating Berkshires future potential and believed the stock to be quite cheap at the moment.
NEUT5|In the letter, buffet highlighted 4 main points.
NEUT6|Firstly the principles of the Berkshire Hathaway system.
NEUT7|Secondly, their largest acquisition of the year.
BEAR8|Thirdly, that Berkshire Hathaway he believed, was underappreciated.
NEUT9|And Lastly the call for investments that the company owned.
NEUT10|Firstly, Buffet explained how the types of investments it made and risk aversion it takes will not be influenced by changes in the composition of the stock market.
NEUT11|He said that the company would remain as a value based company and maintain the famous Berkshire Hathaway process that has been going on for so many years.
BULL12|Next, Berkshire Hathaway hit an all time record for the amount of repurchases reacquiring shares worth nearly $24.7 billion, making up five point 2% of the total shares public for the company.
NEUT13|This was easily Berkshire's largest acquisition in 2020, the next largest being the $8.6 billion investment in Verizon.
BEAR14|The Third Point that Buffet wrote was he believed investors underappreciated.
BEAR15|Berkshire, as a result of the negative view that conglomerates hold?
NEUT16|But they said that his firm was fine with owning non controlling stakes as opposed to other conglomerates who wanted to hold controlling positions.
BEAR17|Plus he acknowledged the dislike that occurs when similar companies to his own act to overvalue their own stock prices to achieve cheaper acquisitions.
NEUT18|He assured that his company would never.
NEUT19|Following these footsteps and why his firm should be seen in a different light.
NEUT20|Finally, his last point in the letter.
NEUT21|He goes through lots of effort to explain the strong benefits and competitive advantages that his big for assets hold.
NEUT22|These four include Berkshire's insurance Operations B NSF, which stands for Burlington, Northern Santa Fe Railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Apple.
BULL23|So the letter created a sense that the company was ready for a successful future, with now being the start for something even greater while the world begins to heal from the effects of the virus.
BULL24|But they believe that he can use it as a platform to grow even bigger.
BULL25|I hope you enjoyed this video.
NEUT26|"My name is Andy and thanks for watching."""
