NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another episode of Bubble Trading."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|I'm gonna be doing some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency BNB or Binance coin.
NEUT3|Not going to be looking at it against USD from Binance US.
NEUT4|As a disclaimer, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT5|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT6|If you're going to do any investing go speak to a certified financial advisor or without.
BEAR7|Let's kick this one right off so anyone watching Bitcoin right now knows that it's kind of starting to pull back and Bitcoin itself is starting to look a little bit weak and this has been bringing down a lot of the altcoins with it.
NEUT8|So with that being said, as far as finance goes.
NEUT9|It's hard to be super bullish on this one had Bitcoin been looking a bit stronger, I would have totally been bullish on this pattern.
BEAR10|So right now I'm a little bit more neutral 'cause at this point we had a huge run up about a month of sideways consolidation.
NEUT11|So this is something I always talk about after a big move up you get a little pullback, then start setting higher lows.
NEUT12|You go sideways for like a month, then you start to test some breakout spots.
NEUT13|So all outlined the bullish and bearish scenario for this crypto and it's pretty simple break to the upside on volume.
NEUT14|Potentially retest.
NEUT15|It doesn't necessarily have to, but it could retest it on some of the lower time frames so that that happens pretty often when you have a break out of like a wedge pattern like this, it will retest on one of the timeframes as long as we start to get some volume similar to this breakout or this break out when we start to break out of this wedge.
NEUT16|The upside?
NEUT17|Maybe a retest, I think.
NEUT18|After that, the next level to watch would be about that $300 range.
NEUT19|A close on the daily above that probably sends this to like 335, three, forty wherever this previous high was, and then a break of that with volume would send this, probably in the price discovery and pretty close to 350 to 400.
NEUT20|Plus in my opinion.
BEAR21|So for the bearish scenario this starts to breakdown on volume, potentially retest.
BEAR22|This wedge breaks down even further then at that point your support levels are going to be pretty much wherever the lows were set.
NEUT23|So I'd say like a breakdown retest first flow is going to be probably 240 right here from this week on this candle below that probably 220 below that.
NEUT24|Probably pretty close to 200, so those would be like the three support levels I'd want to see hold.
NEUT25|If it breaks down from this wedge, retest pulls back with volume or it just comes straight down with volume.
NEUT26|So those are my two bullish and bearish scenarios, so bullish breakout levels to watch are like the 290, two, 95300 ish kind of range and then the 335 range above that price discovery.
NEUT27|We're looking at 3:50 to 400 plus.
NEUT28|Breakdown retest possibly will again like 240 two 2200.
NEUT29|Pretty simple.
NEUT30|That would be my game plan.
NEUT31|I don't have a position, but I'm looking to take one.
NEUT32|I'm just going to wait and see.
NEUT33|You know what kind of opportunity pops up?
NEUT34|So if you guys kind of agree, go ahead and let me know down in the comments if you want me to start anything else let me know down in the comments and again, if you're going to do any investing speech was certified Financial Advisor.
NEUT35|I just wanted to outline both scenarios so you guys can have a better plan.
NEUT36|Potentially if you are taking positions in this or you're watching it, that's just what I'm watching for.
NEUT37|So if you found this video valuable, go ahead and like comment and subscribe and share.
