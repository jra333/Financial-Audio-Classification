NEUT0|"""Davids Best Buy now."
NEUT1|Activision Blizzard.
NEUT2|David most recently made Activision Blizzard a Best Buy now in October of last year.
BULL3|Back then he called out Activision as a company that had probably found increased popularity during the pandemic.
NEUT4|Within person entertainment outside the home difficult if not impossible to pursue.
NEUT5|People were spending more time playing video games.
BULL6|We were impressed with the more than 400,000,000 active monthly users.
BULL7|The company reported in the third quarter of last year, and we're looking forward to seeing how it would continue to grow its business as the world emerged from lockdown.
BULL8|Well, Activision has bold plans for a post pandemic world.
BULL9|Management has a long-term goal of 1 billion monthly active users, as it reiterated in the Q4 2020 earnings report.
BULL10|That would be a 150% increase from the current number.
BULL11|For context, there are about 8 billion or so people on the planet right now, so hitting that Mark would represent some serious market penetration for Activision.
NEUT12|We love to see ambitious goals from our companies.
BULL13|Activision ended 2020 on a great financial note, beating management's own expectations.
BULL14|The company generated $2.41 billion in revenue and $3.05 billion in net bookings in the fourth quarter versus the expected $2 billion and $2.73 billion forecast, respectively.
BULL15|We expect this solid performance to continue in 2021 and beyond.
BULL16|Three of Activision's franchises generated more than $1 billion in net bookings in 2020, and management expects at least two more to approach that scale in the next few years.
BULL17|In the near term, Overwatch two and Diablo four are set to launch soon, which should provide a nice boost to those two popular franchises.
BULL18|Activision Blizzard has done well for investors this past year, but it's not too late to jump in now.
BULL19|We believe even better things are yet to come.
NEUT20|Even if you already own shares, don't be afraid to add a little bit to this clear, proven winner.
NEUT21|I am going to place orders of 2% of My Portfolio an add a little at a time.
