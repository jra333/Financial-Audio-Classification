NEUT0|"""Everyone is welcome to a lot of things that are special."
NEUT1|In this video we will be talking about the TCO or Carnival Corp stock and before we start like always would like to kindly invite you to go ahead and join our family in a community by subscribing to our channel and also hitting the notification Bell button.
NEUT2|In order to make sure that you receive all the latest information.
NEUT3|As we see that absolutely the current situation.
NEUT4|Basically brings a real time news that they're changing the markets so quickly, and we saw yesterday this crazy move about what happened with the travel sector because of the information from Pfizer and we can see here what it says.
BEAR5|Several travel stocks skyrocket on yesterday's we've seen news.
NEUT6|Some prominent examples include airline EasyJet, Chris Company, Carnival Corp. Well yes, but basically with the Carnival Corporation, these guys definitely don't have anything else.
NEUT7|And the reason why we definitely believe that the Carnival Corp.
NEUT8|Uh.
BEAR9|Stock will go down is be 'cause there in loss and there in be close and we saw the report from October and their losses in billions compared to last year where they hit $1.78 billion in profits and stock price was much lower.
NEUT10|So this is absolutely abnormal.
NEUT11|And keep in mind that what Pfizer set is that.
NEUT12|They have to continue testing until the end of the month.
NEUT13|And then potentially if everything is OK, then it's going to go through the FDA.
NEUT14|And if it goes through there, the process will be faster.
NEUT15|Of course, because obviously everyone wants to get a vaccine, but no one is sure whether this is going to work the proper way or not.
NEUT16|And these guys are not opening before the end of the year in any kind of way, so having this.
BULL17|On free market, continue to going up is absolutely not normal and we do believe that the Wall Street is playing there again in order to make quite a lot of money at the moment Becaused.
NEUT18|We go from zero to hero.
NEUT19|Basically we have here the stock on $12.00 and within one day it basically reached like 20.
NEUT20|And did it.
NEUT21|This is not cryptocurrency.
NEUT22|These are stocks.
NEUT23|These are real stocks and billion dollar companies and we can see the market cap of close to $17 billion.
BEAR24|And there potentially in like crazy losses you can see one year return minus 57% so.
NEUT25|This doesn't make any sense.
BEAR26|That is why we definitely believe that this talk, if not this week, then the coming up weeks will definitely go back down to probably 12 or 13.
NEUT27|But this is our prediction.
NEUT28|This is not a financial advice in any kind of way.
NEUT29|You have to understand this.
NEUT30|And this is based on our own research information that we gather and our own due diligence.
NEUT31|Everyone invested their money the way they want to.
NEUT32|What we did this.
BEAR33|We placed two orders with our own money, and we're currently in losses.
NEUT34|Obviously, however, we gonna keep on going with this.
NEUT35|Until we actually get into profits because the potential is really good and you can make 25 to 50% at least on what our expectations are for our own positions as we put skin in the game.
NEUT36|And we gonna see how this is gonna play out over the next couple of hours and days as well.
NEUT37|"If you have your own opinion and you would like to share it with this, please make sure to do it in the comments section down below and we'll see in the next one by."""
