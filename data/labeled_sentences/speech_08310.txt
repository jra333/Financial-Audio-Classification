NEUT8|It's a specific in detail how to cap guide for the Yeezy 350V2 bred.
BULL9|Now the fact that stock is pretty high for this upcoming restock.
BEAR10|These are going to drop quite a bit.
BULL11|Estimated resale prediction for a size 4 and US izingane in U.S. dollars 300 will be our estimated resale prediction after the drop for a four and a half 320 size five 335 we will see increased value for the sizes that were bout to mention.
NEUT12|Five point Bob would expect estimated resale prediction of.
NEUT13|350 size six 346 point.
BEAR14|Five 350 size seven 347 and a half 340 size 8 three forty then we will see slightly decreased value once we get to the larger sizes.
NEUT15|8.5 three 130, size nine 320 and then once we get the sizes, you know nine through 13 and a half would expect those to typically be around 320 U.S. dollars, excluding the 12 and a half because 12 1/2 is a pretty rare size.
BULL16|Would expect that want to do a little better.
NEUT17|It could potentially be around 3:20, but it does have a little more upside than the others in this range.
NEUT18|It could potentially be around 3:40.
NEUT19|It could be hit or miss, and once we get to a size 14310 and 15 or 16, those two sizes are complete hits or misses.
BEAR20|Sometimes these shoes sell for increased value and sometimes they're below market value, so when it comes to 15 or 16 dependent on stock, they are hit or miss.
NEUT21|And please keep in mind these resale predictions are.
BULL22|If stock is higher like we are expecting it and the fact that demand is going to be so, so so high for this upcoming sneaker.
