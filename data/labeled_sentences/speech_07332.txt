BULL0|"""CEO confidence has remained very, very high, supposedly all waiting for clarity on tax reform, and that would spur lots of M&A activity while joining us."
NEUT1|Now.
NEUT2|Jim Forbes of UBS Investment Bank does it absolutely.
NEUT3|Let's think about lowering tax rates from 35% to 20%.
BEAR4|What that does to corporate profits and cash flow, obviously, but also don't forget the repatriation of almost it's over $2 trillion of profits trapped overseas by U.S. companies at the end of the day.
NEUT5|Even at a 14 or 14% tax rate, which is what the House and Senate bills are talking about.
BULL6|It's not all going to be repatriated once, but we're going to have a huge influx of cash back in to the United States.
NEUT7|Some of it obviously be used for share buybacks, some for new capital equipment, etc.
NEUT8|But some of it will be used for M&A, so I think it's another spur for M&A.
NEUT9|But how?
NEUT10|'cause if they go to cash is going to be dilutive if you always shares will be diluted if you go a dead.
NEUT11|The era of, like the big elbows has to be done when you have introduct ability in a question mark.
NEUT12|I don't.
NEUT13|I don't think the the big LBO is over.
NEUT14|I mean, I think if you talk to private equity professionals and I do a lot of work with private equity firms, I think what you're saying is OK if you cap the deductibility at 30% of 80 or.
NEUT15|Just a taxable income.
NEUT16|It's almost like EBIT.
NEUT17|Ah at the end of the day it's not that significant impact what they will do in terms of capital structures have perhaps more preferred equity versus debt, so the days of seeing deals levered 7X may not happen anymore, but will it be 6 and a half with some preferred equity or six with preferred equity at the end of the day, you know if you think about it, reducing that corporate tax rate, whether it's a company owned by private equity or a public company, is dramatic.
NEUT18|At the other day, in terms of the cash flow of the company, so Jim take us into the psychology of the C-Suite.
BEAR19|Because skeptics of the tax overhaul bill would say wait a second, corporations have record amounts of cash on their balance sheet.
BULL20|Already they have the ability to access money through loans at record low levels.
NEUT21|So if there is a good deal out there to be done, they do it.
NEUT22|They don't need the tax bill to persuade them to do a good deal.
NEUT23|I think it's David.
NEUT24|I think it's the last piece of the puzzle we've had.
NEUT25|Some regulatory refirm reform which is positive out of Washington.
NEUT26|But I think CEO's and boards this was sort of the last piece they wanted to see.
NEUT27|To really push forward.
NEUT28|I mean, I've talked about the recipe that.
BULL29|CEO confidence.
NEUT30|Activism.
NEUT31|You know divestitures, carve outs and private equity really being the formula for increased M&A activity.
BULL32|"This is why we're forecasting, you know, substantial activity next year, increasing activity as well as more elephant deals, which are the 10 billion, $20 billion plus deals?"""
