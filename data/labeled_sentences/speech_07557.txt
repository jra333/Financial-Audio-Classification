NEUT0|"""Journal House is, I think, the probably the most holistic manifestation of at least the Wall Street Journal brand in an event."
NEUT1|So this is the second iteration of Journal House.
NEUT2|The first one was in Davos, where we built similarly a two story structure, sort of right in the middle of everything, and it was an opportunity for us to bring together our CEO members, our sponsors and our editors, and in some ways bring the Journal to life.
BULL3|It was incredibly successful for us there, and so the decision that was made to expand and extend the franchise, the Journal House franchise, and this is the Journal House number 2 and can.
NEUT4|Where we're effectively doing the same thing but for the CMO community, this is really more, you know, if the if the newspaper if the brand were a place in a space, sort of how would it feel and what would it look like?
NEUT5|And I think this doesn't really elegant job of that events are important for a number of reasons.
BULL6|For US number one it's a growing revenue stream, both in terms of consumer revenue and advertising revenue.
BULL7|Through sponsorship I would argue you know our digital ad business which is growing.
NEUT8|Is in part predicated on the equity and the sort of authority that we have because we have also physical manifestations of brands.
NEUT9|You see it in it, you know, with retailers to where most of their sales are coming online, but they have the store on 5th Ave because it's sort of it makes them.
NEUT10|Resonant, and I think events can serve a similar purpose to what sort of physical media has done in the past.
NEUT11|It's a way for our brand to be tangible overtime.
NEUT12|They're going to be fewer people who read a physical newspaper.
NEUT13|"It's important to maintain tangibility."""
