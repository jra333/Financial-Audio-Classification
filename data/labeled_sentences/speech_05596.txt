NEUT0|"""Hi Larry, gains power cycle trading.com and in this video I'm going to show you a pairs trade setup for kind of what I call it."
NEUT1|Post earnings, trend trade and this is on Disney now.
NEUT2|Disney just had its earnings release today and they were good so it's going to be up tomorrow in the open, but a way to play Disney is to do it as a pairs trade so it's within the communication sector.
NEUT3|Excelsi as far as the ETF sector, Disney is in that sector.
NEUT4|So if you look at this green line here, this is Disney and you can see how it exploded to the upside, this was back in in about.
NEUT5|April of this past year 2019, so it exploded to the upside and looked.
NEUT6|It just kept going right Mount.
NEUT7|Here's here's the thing that it did come off, but look what came off faster so you can see Excel.
NEUT8|See the purple that came up much faster.
NEUT9|So if you had spread this trade where your long Disney short excelsi even with Disney coming off right here, it still made money.
NEUT10|And then when it turned up it accelerated to the upside a lot faster than excelsi or even SP Y so it's very correlated to excelsi as you'll see in this next slide.
NEUT11|So the correlation is.
NEUT12|Very close .66.
NEUT13|You know we'd like to keep it about .65 Point 7.
NEUT14|So you see Disney here is about .66 X else, so that's a very good correlated security to pair with Disney, so this would be looking at Disney long short excelsi.
NEUT15|So here's Disney on the daily Time frame in a weekly, so it looks really good.
NEUT16|You can see how Disney had sold off real Hard, came back, sold down.
NEUT17|It's been basing at this bottom area here, so it's going to open up tomorrow.
NEUT18|Will see how much it opens, but you can see on the weekly it still looks good.
NEUT19|Now let's compare the two Disney too.
NEUT20|Excel see on charge and then I'll show you what the spread chart looks like.
NEUT21|So this is Disney on a weekly long term chart to the left an Excel see on the right weekly now excelsi looks real good.
NEUT22|Here you can see it's already had a huge move.
BULL23|It's been consolidating, so potentially going to move to the upside so it will probably move to the upside here.
BULL24|Off of Disney being a big chunk of this ETF, what we're looking at here is that Disney has more potential to catch up and more potential upside based on going to those prior highs and then even exceeding that.
NEUT25|So here's a pairs trade idea that you could look at versus just going along Disney or whatever you can look to go along Disney and then.
NEUT26|Pair it by shorting Excelsi against it, so this is the spread charter Paris trade chart of Disney Long excelsi short so you can see it came down here currently today at the close, Disney was trading at $81.45 per share above the ETF excelsi.
NEUT27|Now tomorrow we'll see where it comes in, but you can see it has a big huge potential back to the upside, you can see where it topped out here on the long term chart was 9350 or so.
BULL28|And so today went out at about, let's call it 82 so if you could get back up here to 93 or even exceed that.
NEUT29|93 and 82.
NEUT30|That's going to be, you know, $11.00 per share or on 100 shares.
NEUT31|If you did this 100 by 100, that's $1100 in there.
NEUT32|Really.
NEUT33|Beauty of spread trading pairs trading is that if we do have a pull back, some kind of overnight systemic event happens or whatever, we're not just tide for Disney to make money for it to go up by itself.
NEUT34|It could go sideways to down, but Excelsi could go down a lot harder.
NEUT35|So again, it could go.
BEAR36|Disney could come off, but we could see the ETF excelsi come off a lot harder than Disney.
NEUT37|Our turn sideways, so they're basically did five different ways that you could make money off of this parish trade.
NEUT38|Being long Disney short Excel, see if you'd like to learn more about these types of trades.
BULL39|Will be doing a really good in depth workshop on pairs trading spread trading.
NEUT40|There will be this Saturday the 9th of November, so use the link & up and check it out and we're seeing you.
NEUT41|Hopefully this Saturday.
BULL42|"Good luck trading."""
