NEUT0|"""Today we're going to show you how to value a company from a financial point of view, so you can have some quick tools to analyze if a company is currently trading at a low or expensive price."
NEUT1|The most common method used among investors is using the P ratio.
NEUT2|This ratio compares the market price of the stock versus its earnings.
NEUT3|You can divide a company's market cap by the earnings or taking the current stock price divided by earnings per share.
NEUT4|Let's see an easy example.
NEUT5|Imagine that we have a company and its stock trade at $100 and has an earning per share of $5.
NEUT6|We get as a result, AP ratio of 20.
NEUT7|Normally you can find this ratio in two ways TTM, which is the current P taking the income of the last 12 months or P forwards, which estimates future earnings.
BULL8|This is an amazing tool for companies that have already reported earnings.
NEUT9|But maybe you wonder how you can evaluate a company if the earnings are still negative.
NEUT10|In this case, we will use the price to sales ratio.
NEUT11|We used the market cap divide this time by the company's sales or the current price divided by the revenue per share.
NEUT12|Generally speaking, growth companies will have high ratios because of the company's investors expectations.
BULL13|People think that the company will have a good performance in the future for several reasons and buy the stock pushing the price higher than the earnings or sales.
NEUT14|Each sector has a different P&PS average ratios.
NEUT15|Usually we can say that P ratios over 20 or 25 are expensive and P ratios lower than 20 are cheap ones.
NEUT16|A way to have a better perspective is comparing its historical PE ratio or comparing different PE ratios of different companies in the same sector to see which ones are trading at a lower price and which ones are trading at a higher price.
NEUT17|Another way of evaluating the company is to compare its PE ratio with its year over year growth rate so you can see if the company is going fast enough compared with the price per earnings.
NEUT18|Let's see an example.
NEUT19|Assume that this company has a PE of 10, so it looks that is cheap.
NEUT20|But now let's say that its growth over the year is just 5%.
NEUT21|Can we say that the company is really cheap?
NEUT22|If the company has apigee over one, it is expensive compared with its growth and if it is below, it is cheap compared to its growth.
NEUT23|These are good guidelines to get an idea of the real price you are paying for a stock.
NEUT24|After these calculations, we recommend researching deeper into the company, because these equations cover only the price and valuation side.
NEUT25|It does not consider the liquidity their returns on the investment, the performance itself, or the rest of the market conditions.
NEUT26|Deeper research will lead you to a point where you know it.
NEUT27|It's a good or a bad company.
NEUT28|So also look at the business model innovation and the rest of the financial statements.
BEAR29|Keep in mind that growth companies with high ratios are only expectations, so if the company does not fulfill that hype in the market will decrease drastically in the future.
NEUT30|You decide what kind of investor you are.
NEUT31|Do you like expensive companies with high ratios?
NEUT32|Then maybe you are closer to a profile like a growth investor or you like more cheap companies that produce good earning and cash.
NEUT33|So probably are closer to a value investor profile.
NEUT34|I hope this will give you an idea of where to start evaluating a company.
