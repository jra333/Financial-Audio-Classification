NEUT0|"""Nova VAX, with some trial data."
NEUT1|Meg Tyrell has the results.
NEUT2|Meg.
BULL3|Hi Sarah, well Nova Vax ran some large trials in the UK and in South Africa and we're getting the 1st results from those studies and guys.
NEUT4|This is really the first look we're seeing on the ground of the vaccine's efficacy against these new variants circulating in those countries.
BULL5|Now the overall effectiveness in the UK Phase three trial of 15,000 people was 89%.
NEUT6|That included about half the cases in the trial that were that new variant B117 when they actually broke down the efficacy against the different variants, the.
BULL7|Older one, the vaccine was 95.6% effective against that.
BULL8|That is up there comparable with what we saw from Pfizer and Moderna.
BULL9|But when they isolated the B117 variants the efficacy was 85.6%.
BULL10|So overall you're seeing 89.89 point 3% efficacy in that UK trial.
NEUT11|Now the more concerning results come from South Africa.
NEUT12|A much smaller trial of about 4400 people where they saw 90% of the cases in the trial where that B1351 variant that we know.
BEAR13|Was likely to evade some of the protection from the vaccines and it does appear that is the case.
NEUT14|60% efficacy among people in the South Africa trial, mostly driven by this new variant that was when they included only people who are HIV negative when they included people who are also HIV positive, the efficacy was only 49% in that South African trial.
NEUT15|That doesn't sound great guys, especially when you're comparing two vaccines that are 95% effective against the old strain.
NEUT16|However, they do note that in the trial.
NEUT17|They you know, saw some patients who had already been infected with the original strain of the coronavirus and just looking at the data, they note that prior infection with Covid may not provide protection against subsequent infection by the SA Escape variant.
BULL18|However, vaccination with their vaccine provided significant protection 49 to 60%.
NEUT19|Now guys this is a press release.
NEUT20|These have not been peer reviewed.
NEUT21|The company also announcing in this press release they are working on new vaccines targeting emerging strains.
NEUT22|They're going to select those in the coming days.
NEUT23|And plan to start clinical testing of them in the second quarter of this year.
NEUT24|Meanwhile, they're running a large trial in the US and Mexico as well.
NEUT25|They expect to have that fully enrolled with 30,000 people in the first half of February.
NEUT26|Doctor found she said this week they're expecting those results in March, but guys, you know this is the first time we've seen efficacy against these strains, and we should see more from the J&J trial within a few days.
NEUT27|Guys back to you.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
