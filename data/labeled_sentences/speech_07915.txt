NEUT0|"""Welcome to Andrew Labor show where we talk about investing in the stock market."
NEUT1|Anything from analyzing a company to see if it's a good investment or not, how much money one can make every year in dividends, if they invested in a dividend paying company of course, and now this new playlist we're going to use to determine if a company's share price.
NEUT2|Is it a fair fair price?
NEUT3|Is it overvalued?
BULL4|Is undervalued.
NEUT5|Which is it?
NEUT6|So?
NEUT7|The first company we're going to use in this playlist is going to be Best Buy current.
NEUT8|Share price $118 in 19 cents as of March 19th at the close of March 19th.
NEUT9|Before I move on to courage, everyone hit that like button hit the subscribe button, and don't forget that notification Bell.
NEUT10|I post new videos at least every Monday and Friday more often if I can.
NEUT11|So current share price $118.19.
NEUT12|Overvalued, undervalued or fair.
NEUT13|Let's take a look.
NEUT14|Now it's very, very simple.
NEUT15|What I do is very quick to what I do is I figure out what the dividend yield was on a series of dates and always January 1st, 2007 and I'll do June 1st, 2007.
NEUT16|Assuming I always go back to 2007, assuming a company has a long enough dividend history to go back that far.
NEUT17|But Daniel January 1st, 2007 June 1st, 2007 and then I keep doing January 1st, June 1st, over and over again each year.
NEUT18|Until you can see here at the bottom, I get to January 1st, 2021.
NEUT19|And then what I'll do is I figure out what the yearly dividend was on on all these dates and then with the closing share price was on those dates as well.
NEUT20|And then from that I was able I'm able to determine what the dividend yield was on those dates and then I take.
NEUT21|I just figure out what the average is.
NEUT22|And on here going down you can see I averaging all them together.
BULL23|In this case, for Best Buy had come on coming up with 2.31% is the average.
NEUT24|So what I will do is.
NEUT25|Take the current dividends paid actual dollar amount in, which happens to be $2.80 per year per share, and I divide that by the average dividend yield of .0231 an.
NEUT26|I'm coming up with the share price of $121.21, so that is what I believe to be a fair share price for Best Buy $121.21.
NEUT27|You can see here the current share price right?
NEUT28|This slightly below that, not by much.
NEUT29|So overall I would say a fair value, but slightly undervalued, so a little bit of a bargain.
NEUT30|I would say given given the current dividend yield, that they're at right now, but the reason why I do it this way and the reason why I use the average is because looking at all these dividend yields right here and I've done it with other companies as well that the dividend yield always seems to stay around the average.
NEUT31|Sometimes it's below, sometimes it's above.
NEUT32|It is somewhere around the average and always stays to always stays around there.
NEUT33|So if you know the average dividend yield is, you should be able to determine if relatively relatively good estimate of what the fair share price should be based on the based on the dividend yield.
NEUT34|So that's what I got for everyone right here, remember?
NEUT35|$121.21 is what I think for Best Buy.
BULL36|Just my opinion but thanks so much for tuning in everybody.
NEUT37|Remember hit that like Button hit subscribe button.
NEUT38|I post new videos at least every Monday and Friday more often if I can.
BULL39|"Thanks so much everybody."""
