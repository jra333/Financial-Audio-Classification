BEAR0|"""Watch out while attention is focused on impeachment, the incoming Biden administration will soon face other crises and potential global trouble spots that could adversely affect the economy."
NEUT1|The stock market on our security.
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times.
NEUT3|Our new president will have his hands full with foreign policy problems when he takes office on January 20th.
BEAR4|One flare up is coming to our southern border via Central America and Mexico.
NEUT5|President elect Biden is seen as a dove on immigration.
BEAR6|Moreover, the damage wrought on Central American economies by both COVID-19 and natural disasters is prompting people to consider trekking North to the US.
BULL7|During the campaign, Democrats promised to immediately revoke Trump measures.
NEUT8|Aimed at stopping waves of people flocking to our borders.
BEAR9|Biden officials are now backtracking on those promised for appeals, but it looks like a humanitarian border crisis is looming.
NEUT10|Another hot spot is Iraq.
BEAR11|The country is going bust because of low oil prices and sheer government ineptitude and corruption.
BULL12|A crisis here will give Iran an opening to are malicious and gained sway over this oil producing nation.
BULL13|A triumph of the outgoing administration has been curbing Iran's imperils designs in the Middle East.
NEUT14|What will president like Biden, previously in Appeaser of Iran's terrorist regime do now?
BEAR15|Serious unrest in a country few people have ever heard of.
BEAR16|Belarus could trigger an major crisis for NATO.
NEUT17|The linchpin of our post World War Two security arrangements.
BEAR18|People in Belarus want to be rid of, their longtime dictator, who last year rigged presidential election, thereby sparking riots.
BEAR19|Harsh crackdowns aided by secret Russian agents have kept the dictator installed for now, but nicer weather in spring could well lead to mass rights again and possible Russian.
NEUT20|Intervention.
BEAR21|What if Putin in attempt to thoroughly humiliate NATO temporarily send Russian forces in neighboring Lithuania to deal with below Russian bandits?
NEUT22|Under NATO we would be obliged to send in armed forces.
BEAR23|Would Biden back down in return for vague promises of withdrawal thereby discrediting NATO?
BEAR24|Europe is already split on how to deal with Russia.
NEUT25|Germany wants appeasement.
NEUT26|By contrast.
BULL27|Sweden's political parties both left and right have agreed on a major expansion of the country's armed forces.
BULL28|In response to Russia's truculent actions.
NEUT29|An even bigger challenge will be how President Biden deals with increasingly aggressive actions by Beijing regarding Taiwan.
NEUT30|Well, we stand by if China attempts to do to Taiwan what it did to Hong Kong.
BEAR31|Such passivity would have devastating repercussions in Asia and the world.
BEAR32|It would undermine any US credibility to curb global ambitions of both China and Russia.
NEUT33|Our next president will not be lacking for extremely serious difficulties.
NEUT34|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT35|Thank you for listening.
BULL36|"Do send in comments and suggestions and I look forward to being with you soon again."""
