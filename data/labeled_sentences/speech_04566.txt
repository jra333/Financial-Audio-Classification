NEUT0|"""Joining me now is Sean Mccalmont."
NEUT1|He's president of Career learning solutions at K12, showing it's great to have you.
BEAR2|I mean, what an insane year.
NEUT3|How much business have you picked up so far?
BULL4|Yeah, thanks for having me Kelly, you know K12 has been the leader in virtual education in K through 12 grades for a number of years.
BULL5|This year will have about 170,000 students plus on our platforms that's about 40% growth over prior year and I'll just say that the covid pandemic has really sent more families to K12 and our various all learning solutions.
NEUT6|But it's also sent a number of school districts are always seeking a solution for literally.
BEAR7|Hundreds of thousands of students that are at home.
NEUT8|So what would you tell investors who are concerned about this Miami decision today to end into agreement with my school online?
NEUT9|Well, you know, Miami Dade is one of those large school districts.
NEUT10|It's looking for a covid solution, and it was a complex solution with a very short time frame, which really became a Herculean task to solve.
BEAR11|And so we weren't able to meet that complexity in the time that we had.
NEUT12|But I will say that that particular installation won't have an impact on our financial position.
NEUT13|I think it was a special project that was more about creating something new and innovative, not about the bottom line.
NEUT14|So so again, no financial impact on the company.
BULL15|And by the way we share Superintendent Carvalho's vision for an innovative and blended learning solution.
NEUT16|This is going to take time to develop, but that said also.
NEUT17|I mean, we've got a number of other school district relationships we've managed over the years.
NEUT18|That number that we're adding during code.
NEUT19|Yeah, and kind of on that.
NEUT20|In that vein, where do you see on line learning going in the next couple of years because?
NEUT21|You know, if we all get a vaccine or a pandemic solution, we can go back to normal.
NEUT22|Is it going to look like it used to look, or is the genie out of the bottle now with online learning?
BULL23|Yeah, I think online learning is is picking up steam.
NEUT24|It's becoming more normal and I believe that most school districts school districts around the country will have an online learning solution that essentially, you know, insures against what's happened now with the pandemic.
NEUT25|"So so I think it's moving in the direction of more normal than not."""
