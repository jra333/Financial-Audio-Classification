NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well the downtrend continues an really any signs of bullishness right now.
NEUT5|I would say you need to be very very skeptical of until OK Clay until what well.
NEUT6|Very straightforward way to engage this chart going forward.
NEUT7|Has everything to do with that purple line there and if you watched my past videos and you've heard me talk about this time and time again but it continues to hold true but that purple and there on my chart is denoting the very well known.
NEUT8|The very famous 50.
NEUT9|Moving average and my point here is this.
NEUT10|Any sort of bullishness I don't care be sceptical until the price can at least break above it and close above that purple line.
NEUT11|What do I mean?
NEUT12|Well, let's go through a quick history lesson.
NEUT13|There is some great bullish movement.
BEAR14|Problem is it was below that purple line the whole time.
NEUT15|Totally rolled back over.
BEAR16|For some great bullish movement, problem is rolled back over 'cause again, it was below that purple line right there.
NEUT17|Look at that nice bounce rolled back over even right here.
NEUT18|Little miniature bounds rolled back over you.
NEUT19|Look at from where it was at these lows up to the highs from this morning.
NEUT20|All I mean, nice move, nice bounce.
NEUT21|But the problem is still stayed below that purple line and then back down it went zero and then you look at right here last 30 minutes of the day.
NEUT22|Nice little green candle so who knows?
NEUT23|Maybe this is filing the start of some sort of truly bullish move.
NEUT24|But my point here is that I would be very skeptical of.
NEUT25|Any sort of bullishness until the price can actually get above that purple line and stay up above it for those reasons, just displayed over the past couple of weeks.
NEUT26|It has been one false bounce after another, so keep an eye on that dynamic.
BULL27|As far as always supported concern now.
NEUT28|Key level of support.
NEUT29|Keep an eye on now moving forward can be right here.
NEUT30|I think it basically where the price bonds today.
NEUT31|Yeah, right around the 114 mark.
NEUT32|If 114 cannot hold up then no such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT33|But I don't think anybody would be shocked to see the price then drift down to right around the one 1275 Mark Piazza.
NEUT34|Right now.
NEUT35|Pretty brutal downtrend, but it's all about that purple line.
NEUT36|Let's see if the price can maybe get a break up next week.
NEUT37|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT38|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL40|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird.
NEUT42|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT43|But in a cruel way.
BEAR44|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT47|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT48|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT49|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
