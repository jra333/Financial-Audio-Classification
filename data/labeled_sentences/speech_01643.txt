NEUT3|To my regular viewers, what's up?
NEUT4|Welcome back with that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT5|Let's talk.
NEUT6|Money will start off with a quick background.
NEUT7|BitTorrent has been around for the last 20 years and I'm sure at least know what it is.
NEUT8|Unless you've truly been living under a rock.
NEUT9|While most people don't know that lately, BitTorrent has become more decentralized.
NEUT10|Tron is a popular blockchain, has been discussed in this channel before.
NEUT11|1 July of 2018.
NEUT12|Tron Purchase BitTorrent that will later lead to the creation of the BT token Inferia 2019.
NEUT13|The BitTorrent token is a TRC Dash 10 token.
NEUT14|Those create on top of the Trump blockchain as a way to extend the capabilities of BitTorrent.
NEUT15|Some of these decentralized applications that BT powers are BitTorrent speed, BitTorrent, file system and the life.
NEUT16|Quick disclosure.
NEUT17|I'm not a financial advisor, never will be.
NEUT18|Always be doing your own due diligence.
NEUT19|Let us briefly look at the recent price fluctuation of BT.
BULL20|On April 4, 2021, BT finally reached the psychologically appealing price of 1 cent.
BULL21|The next day, BT set a new all time high of 1.4 cents.
NEUT22|If we dig deeper, the stats aren't even crazier.
BULL23|For the past 24 hours, BT is up 43%.
BULL24|It's up 218% in the past seven days and up 880% for the past 30 days.
NEUT25|Back on March 25th I posted a video when the price of BT was around 0.3 cents.
NEUT26|I gave him a price prediction that BT Wheat ran over one sent by the end of the year.
NEUT27|I'll be honest and I didn't think it would happen this soon.
NEUT28|So in this video I'll give you my updated price prediction.
NEUT29|So what's my opinion on BT more specifically moving forward?
BULL30|Well, I definitely expect this coin to continue to increase in value.
NEUT31|BitTorrent is the go to when it comes to peer to peer sharing.
NEUT32|This means that BT is backed up by a legit entity.
NEUT33|It's also been around for a couple years and BT really has no red flags of a scam coin.
BULL34|I think it's a great long term project.
BEAR35|Right now that it's near, its all time high can feel cautious that there might be a significant dip in the near future.
NEUT36|However, though, when or how much is anyone's guess.
NEUT37|If you believe in a project, in my opinion should just be buying consistently the highs and the lows.
NEUT38|History has shown us that what brings investors the biggest returns is holding for the long term.
NEUT39|It's possible that BT continues to occur in the next few weeks and runs up to two or three cents.
NEUT40|So now buying at the current price is also a risk.
NEUT41|So where do you buy BT?
NEUT42|BT is available on many crypto exchanges, but the most popular ways to purchase BT or through the following exchanges finance WABI and kucoin for my updated price prediction.
BEAR43|"I think this insane growth will slow down, but this one still has a lot of room to run I think by the end of 2021 BT will be trained at four cents on the lower end, or seven cents on the higher end."""
