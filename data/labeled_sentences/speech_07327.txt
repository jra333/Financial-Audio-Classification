NEUT0|"""We can talk about the data that we got from from Uber as well as their marketing campaign behind it."
NEUT1|These full page ads in the Journal at least talking about not just the numbers, but the efforts that they're doing to remedy it.
NEUT2|Joanna, how impressive is it?
NEUT3|I think it's impressive when you look at the entire gig economy and all of the tech companies across the board which have just had issues controlling their platforms, right?
NEUT4|The problem is not necessarily been the technology of these companies.
BEAR5|It's been the people, the bad actors that have come on to their their platforms and started to abuse it.
BULL6|And so I think this is a huge step in the right direction for all of the tech companies because luebbers being transparent about it.
BULL7|Farhad, I'm impressed and I will give Uber a hard time when I believe they deserve it.
NEUT8|But this is an 84 page report if you count the appendix and then the cover page goes into a lot of depth on this and I would argue gives a lot of context and be sure they don't have other peoples data but they have the overall data on ****** assaults on homicides.
NEUT9|Things like that and they put into context the degree to which they've made progress that the small number of incidents those still concerning.
NEUT10|That occur on these rides and what their policies are, what they've been doing to try to address this?
NEUT11|I mean, it does set the bar for a lot of other companies, I would argue.
BULL12|Yeah, I think you're right.
NEUT13|I mean if you think about it, what Uber does is sort of when it started.
BEAR14|It was a crazy idea.
NEUT15|You'd have strangers giving other people a ride and they have struggled for a long time.
NEUT16|To, you know, convince lawmakers the public and others that this is kind of a fundamentally safe idea.
NEUT17|And I think this report does it.
BEAR18|I mean, the only thing I would fault them for is is doing it.
NEUT19|You know, many years too late I would have done this several years ago, but I think that you know and the numbers are the headline numbers seem.
NEUT20|Bad, I mean the sort of number of bad incidents.
NEUT21|But if you compare it to the scale of you know of the platform, billions of rides, it's a very very tiny number and you know they are committed to improving it.
NEUT22|I think that doing this also sets them apart from the competition.
NEUT23|I am eager to see lifts numbers now you know and ride hailing platforms around around the world.
NEUT24|And I'm not sure if you know if those companies will be better.
BEAR25|They may be worse than that would be bad for them and would be.
NEUT26|You know it be assigned that Uber is you know a more mature platform.
NEUT27|In doing something doing something you know positive an effective to maintain safety on its platform.
NEUT28|It is an interesting calculus, Joanna whether or not.
NEUT29|This kind of disclosure will make users feel safer or not.
BEAR30|I mean, the data on its face, is disturbing.
NEUT31|But the fact that they're willing to admit it is not yeah.
NEUT32|I mean, I think it makes users feel safer when this comes from the company itself, then versus the press and that they were trying to cover this up for many years.
NEUT33|So that's where I think exactly what John was saying before.
BULL34|This should set precedent for other companies.
NEUT35|I would love to see this kind of report come from Amazon about how many unsafe products they know they've sold this year.
NEUT36|Certainly Amazon would know better than many of the other investigations that have been happening about it.
NEUT37|Air BNB.
NEUT38|Tons of companies could could use this as an example and say we're going to go forward.
NEUT39|We don't know yet quite what we're going to do next after this, but at least we're going to be honest with you and say we know this is a problem and we're looking at it.
NEUT40|We're going to.
NEUT41|It's going to.
NEUT42|"We'll see what let follows up if in fact they do."""
