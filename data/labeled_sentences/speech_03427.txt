NEUT0|"""Joe, if if this is a stock that is moving detached the fundamentals right now, what continues to push it?"
NEUT1|I mean, is this still the epic short squeeze of short squeezes as it has been suggested over the last couple of days?
NEUT2|Yeah, it seems to be the short squeeze of all short squeezes.
NEUT3|I can't really see what's driving it at this point.
NEUT4|I understand we have a new gaming cycle.
BULL5|The consoles are coming out and this year should be a very good year for them.
BULL6|They're going to get back to profitability.
BULL7|Sales are going to be very strong.
NEUT8|But at the same time, I mean, you could just this this price level.
NEUT9|Understand how you can justify it, where we are today.
NEUT10|Yeah, and go ahead, yeah.
NEUT11|No, that's why you know, even we were trying to show that even with our bullish outlook on the fundamentals, you're still only at a $330 price target $33.34.
NEUT12|Somewhere in that area is what we're thinking.
BULL13|Yeah, and to that point.
BEAR14|I mean, we're at $78 a share right now, so 33 would be what more more than 50% drop.
NEUT15|But you are still a street high in terms of that price target.
NEUT16|So how do you get there?
NEUT17|Yeah, well we were thinking we're using 2022 when things are a little bit more normalized.
BULL18|We're thinking the company has been doing a lot of things right.
BULL19|They've been controlling expenses, their operating more efficiently there driving profitability.
BULL20|So we're assuming let's say they get back to a 3% operating profit margin in 2022.
NEUT21|And what is evadale look like and put an 8 times even though multiple on 255 or so million Aviva to?
NEUT22|And that gets you to $33.
NEUT23|So that's really what we're doing.
NEUT24|And I know I'm more bullish than a lot of the rest of the street right now.
BULL25|But I do believe that they can get there that they can operate better at Once Upon a time.
BULL26|They did have a 7% operating margin.
BULL27|So even with this game cycle coming, we should see better profitability and that supports the stock to go a little bit higher, but not at $70.00 or even $160.00 like there was at one point today.
NEUT28|But I just wonder when the crowd seizes control of an asset like this as an investor who's trying to be smart, what are you supposed to do?
NEUT29|And this could apply to Tesla.
NEUT30|One could argue.
NEUT31|I mean, I remember Elon Musk saying that that stock was expensive along time ago when it was in a whole different stratosphere than it is now.
NEUT32|It could apply to Bitcoin.
NEUT33|How do you think about that?
NEUT34|So we're trying to stay disciplined and with the investors that I've spoken to on GameStop or just in general.
BULL35|You know, I think if you take a disciplined approach it the stock hit your price target.
NEUT36|You just move on, or at least pare back some of your position.
NEUT37|Maybe you keep a little bit just in case the stock keeps running higher, but you have to have benchmarks and price points where you want to buy it or sell it.
BULL38|You know today, bed Bath and Beyond was another one that's been gotten moving a lot higher player today because of a short squeeze.
NEUT39|You know, talking to investors.
NEUT40|Some people said you know what it's doubled in two weeks.
NEUT41|I'm ready to pull off of that and I'll buy it back when it gets back down to 30 or so, which happened all in one day.
NEUT42|So I think that's what you have to think about.
NEUT43|You have to have discipline.
NEUT44|Prices for entry in for exit.
