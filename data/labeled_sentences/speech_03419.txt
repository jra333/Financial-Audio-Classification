NEUT0|"""Hey traders, Ragy here an in this free video we're going to do a deep dive into the energy markets crude oil heating well."
NEUT1|Are Bob Gas and Natty gas?
NEUT2|So let's kick this off with crude.
NEUT3|Now, one of the questions I've been getting a lot of is Rocky is crude.
NEUT4|Still potentially a buy set up and I'll be looking for a very similar setup to the long side, mostly with crude oil calls down near these lows, despite the fact that we've broken $50 before, that's not some sort of hard and fast floor that's impenetrable, nor is it something that we can't come back from.
NEUT5|And we've been down here before.
BEAR6|In fact, the low that kicked off a reversal pattern that I've been watching actually triggered a low at 4931.
NEUT7|We have yet to take that low out, so if we take that low out, my next target down is near 46 1/2.
NEUT8|But as long as 4931 remains intact, I'll be looking for calls again and looking to get long in the CLO market now.
NEUT9|Does that necessarily set up our Bob?
NEUT10|Are Bob is in an as is crude and heating all there in their mid February to June seasonal bullish cycles?
NEUT11|Now a seasonal bullish cycle is not as set up, it's a tendency you couple that tendency with an uptrend or the technicals, right?
NEUT12|You take a technical, you take a tendency and now you've got.
NEUT13|I think a higher probability setup.
NEUT14|So I do want to focus on the long side, most especially with OPEC still scheduled to be meeting on the 6th.
BEAR15|There is a higher expectation that they are not going to be increasing.
NEUT16|The production cuts, but we'll see what happens between now and then.
NEUT17|I don't anticipate that meeting to do anything to weaken energy.
NEUT18|So yes, I'm looking for different long positions in our Bob and encourage and we'll talk more about that in the premium video.
NEUT19|But remember, we have the seasonal tendency, and I do believe we have the technicals to justify a long position that brings us to heating oil.
BEAR20|Zero heating oil has put in a lower low, likely because we have had a milder winter.
NEUT21|Now I live in Florida so I'm not discussing winter.
NEUT22|I have no place to do so, but let me say this.
NEUT23|Unless the EIA starts increasing the heating degree days and and we hear about different cold snaps coming through and the demand for heating oil and natural gas for that matter increases, this is then generally considered a mild winter from the energy perspective I'm going to leave heating well on the.
BEAR24|The shelf for now because it is punching down to a lower low.
NEUT25|In fact, if anything, I might start treating this ever so slightly like natural gas, where I think we have bearish structure to start shorting into bounces.
NEUT26|I don't want to do that in our Bob or in crude, but I might be open to doing it in heating oil and that brings us to natural gas.
BEAR27|We've been short this market now for about 6-7 days.
BULL28|It's been a nice drop.
NEUT29|We're looking for the 1.8 level.
NEUT30|One point.
BULL31|8550 could be an optional target, but I am looking for more weakness at a natural gas and this has been a really nice move from.
NEUT32|The the wave here from the 34 AM a wave so I'm bullish are Bob.
NEUT33|I'm bullish, crude.
BEAR34|I'm bearish heating well.
NEUT35|Bearish natural gas will talk about from where and when that timing might be right in the premium video.
NEUT36|But put those on your watchlist.
NEUT37|"Long crude long are Bob short heating oil and definitely short natural gas and I'll see you in the next update."""
