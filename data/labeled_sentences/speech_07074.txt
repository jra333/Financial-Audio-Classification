NEUT0|"""Up next, we're looking at Facebook."
BEAR1|Obviously it's taken over headlines.
BEAR2|Today the security is down a little, about half a percent, joining me on set is David Benoit, lead writer for our Wonderful Deal Journal blog, David Peter Thiel, Big famed Investor in Facebook, is cashing out.
NEUT3|It looks like he said, you know what I've had enough.
NEUT4|I'm gone.
NEUT5|What can you tell me about Peter?
NEUT6|Well, so Peter Thiel had a pretty good deal here.
NEUT7|He got in 2004, put in $500,000.
NEUT8|So where it's our mistake that we didn't see this in 2004?
NEUT9|We could be sitting on, you might have.
NEUT10|You might have been signing up for Facebook in 2004, but not giving Mark Zuckerberg.
NEUT11|Your money, and so Peter Thiel, is essentially cashed out.
NEUT12|A billion dollars plus this year.
NEUT13|That's over the course of this year that is the IPO he sold a whole bunch in that.
NEUT14|And now he's all 20 million shares.
NEUT15|Last week after the lockup ended, which should remember.
BEAR16|'cause Facebook shares to fall apart again follow the new lows is kind of people got all worried about who was selling what?
NEUT17|It looks like this deal is.
NEUT18|So far the only one that's filed to say I sold.
NEUT19|So I mean, is that the positive here that I mean if you look at all of the big name investors who are in on the ground floor feels really the only one who said alright, I'm out, that's enough I'm.
NEUT20|I am enjoying my huge rewards and is that?
NEUT21|Is that a positive?
NEUT22|That's really only been here.
NEUT23|I mean, I think I think that probably some people are taking some kind of solace in that fact and he still himself still holds around 7,000,000.
NEUT24|Shares so it's not like he sold everything, and certainly there was an opportunity last week to sell and some people decided not to.
NEUT25|Even people that had been in you know, like feel early and are still standing to gain a lot of money.
BEAR26|Even with Facebook off about half of its IPO price.
BEAR27|I mean, given how much it has four minutes IPO that things went from bad to worse.
NEUT28|I mean it is a situation we are seeing.
NEUT29|Some investors will call bottom fish.
BEAR30|They're looking at the decline in the price.
NEUT31|They're saying you know, what?
NEUT32|If I look at the cover, this may be a good time to get in or we seeing some of that.
NEUT33|Yeah, there's been kind of a lot of chatter about, you know.
NEUT34|Below $20 is start getting North by we saw George Soros and Steve Cohen a couple of big name investors take stakes in the second quarter.
NEUT35|We found out.
NEUT36|When it was still more than 20, we had an analyst upgrade it yesterday.
BULL37|The stock rally 5% yesterday to close above 20 bucks.
NEUT38|Certainly I think I think there are still very clear divisions on what you think about Facebook.
NEUT39|It is either a screaming buy or a screaming self and I guess the screaming cell is purely evaluation thing.
NEUT40|If you look at where Facebook's trading given they sold a lot more shares of people expected.
NEUT41|If you look at the price, if you just look for market capitalization and what their forward earnings are, there's a lot of people that you do the math and it just says.
BEAR42|I don't like it at this level.
NEUT43|Is that the argument against?
NEUT44|Yeah, I think I think a lot of people say.
NEUT45|I mean it's still North of $40 billion company and.
NEUT46|Why I think it's the question I think I think the story the entire time.
BEAR47|I think there's been people just aren't sure what to make of this company in Facebook hasn't cleared up any answers really.
BULL48|There's still, you know, there's a lot of hype about its ability to sell ads on mobile.
NEUT49|There's a lot of hype about a lot of stuff, but I mean, what about the relationship that could potentially be created between through the Board and Zuckerberg and the people that run this company?
NEUT50|Ultimately, a following stock price is something that they have to.
NEUT51|They all large shareholders in this company that continues to fall.
NEUT52|I mean, that's.
NEUT53|The risk here is that there's some shakeup to fix, a market that is saying, you know about a lot of things that Facebook does, right?
NEUT54|Well, the other thing to keep in mind with Facebook always is that Mark Zuckerberg controls this company.
NEUT55|There's really no, whatever he wants is going to happen by both the agreement he has with other shareholders to vote their shares with him by his substantial ownership, which he isn't selling at all.
NEUT56|He's going, he's going to side and he's made it very clear that he doesn't necessarily care about being a public company.
NEUT57|Zuckerberg decided, and that's the way it is.
BULL58|"Well, David, thank you so much for joining us."""
