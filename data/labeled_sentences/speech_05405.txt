BEAR0|"""The New Zealand dollar has experienced a sharp drop against the US dollar as the new week started."
BEAR1|The price started to trade around the level of 7167 and drop the one point by almost 200 pips and the week has mainly just started now.
NEUT2|Some people say that we're dealing with a head and shoulders.
NEUT3|With this being, the head is being the left and this being the right shoulder.
NEUT4|Now.
BEAR5|If that is correct then the price is going to be lower and potentially 6727 now I wouldn't go.
NEUT6|In short, this currency pair right now right here because the market has already moved quite aggressively, but it wouldn't be surprising to see people potentially short selling on a balance, so I've just taken a Fibonacci from.
NEUT7|It's very high, just very low here, and it tells us that people are probably going to be quite keen on short selling between 1753 all the way up to 7105.
NEUT8|This is today's short market update.
