NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol, PFE."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL2|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but look down here at the volume an well above average volume on the day.
NEUT3|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT4|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT5|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT6|You never say, hey, you know what make this chart look.
NEUT7|The absolute strongest moving forward, and that would be the price could say up there above 3560.
NEUT8|Now don't get me wrong.
BEAR9|The price falls below 3560.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage to stay above that level.
BULL11|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT15|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to just gauging the health of the overall move, that right there would be defined as the overall move.
NEUT16|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT17|As a line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT18|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT19|Yeah, staying above 3560 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT20|The big battleground right now that the price continues to struggle with right there at.
NEUT21|Let's see what is at 3585.
BULL22|Now, to be fair, that last 30 minutes the price actually got up above it.
BEAR23|Problem is, the price couldn't stay up above it, so therefore that's going to still be considered at main area of resistance.
BEAR24|That's been certainly very stubborn.
NEUT25|Over the past couple of days, but the good news is the price is still well within striking distance of it, so it'll be interesting to see if the price can break up above there or not.
NEUT26|But All in all, very nice uptrend right now and as long as the price keeps on putting in those higher bases, that is by far what matters most.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT29|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT30|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR35|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
