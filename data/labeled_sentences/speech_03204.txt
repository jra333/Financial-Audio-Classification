NEUT0|"""Alright, let's do final trades carry your first."
NEUT1|American Express combines financials and travel.
BULL2|Higher interest rates, help and people going places and spending their money is very good for American Express.
BULL3|OK, thank you for that joti.
NEUT4|The value proposition on Pinterest is the positive comment platform that it provides.
BULL5|Engagement is high, the stock is going to continue to push higher.
NEUT6|I own it will see it North of 90 and probably North of 100 in the near future.
BULL7|Alright, thank you Steve Weiss.
BULL8|Ericsson stock I've owned for a long time, 45 billion market cap earnings growing 50%'s been restructured, continue to pick up share from waway.
NEUT9|If you like the 5G story at all, you gotta like this because they're only two companies that make the infrastructure and Erickson is by far the better one.
NEUT10|OK and farmer Jim.
NEUT11|OK, Kinder Morgan.
NEUT12|We haven't talked about this in awhile.
BULL13|In two weeks they should raise their dividend.
BULL14|I think they'll raise it to $1.25.
NEUT15|Should have a dividend yield of 6%, which means the stock at 1680 should go to 2080.
NEUT16|There I've given you and Steve a lot of rope with which to hang me.
NEUT17|If I'm wrong.
BULL18|Yeah, alright, thank you guys.
BULL19|Good to see everybody.
BULL20|"Thanks for watching as well."""
