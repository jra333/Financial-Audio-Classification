NEUT0|"""One, and we're doing a live video right now on Amazon Weekly Chart."
NEUT1|Alright, back to the weekly chart.
NEUT2|What we're going to do with SMF Pro Traders is we get video one and Video 2.
NEUT3|This is Google Weekly.
NEUT4|This is Amazon Weekly.
BEAR5|Both had their pullbacks and both had declining weekly moving averages and the difference between the two is is that they had characteristics of a rising 20 week during their pullbacks and because of the Rising 20 week moving average.
NEUT6|That's why their four week.
NEUT7|Both had four week consolidations right here.
BEAR8|Both had weekly breakouts.
NEUT9|And why was one stronger than the other?
BULL10|Amazon was stronger than the other because the tenwek flattened out here.
BEAR11|And whereas during that double week breakout on Google, the ten week kept declining in price.
NEUT12|And both.
NEUT13|Why did that weekly moving average told was because of the Rising 20 week on both except Amazon's Rising 20 week was much more stronger than that.
NEUT14|20 week on Google?
NEUT15|Why?
BEAR16|Because Google dropped $109.
NEUT17|That's why off of the high and create short people.
NEUT18|I just want you to know that on these weekly SMF bear and bull trends is that Amazon 20 week, even though that we pull back and we shorted it.
NEUT19|Both is that the weekly moving averages the weekly consolidations here held because that even though the ten week was going down, but twenty week is much more prompted because there's ten weeks between the two.
BULL20|But you kept rising in the ten week moving average.
BEAR21|And Google's ten week moving average was rising slightly and that kind of flattened out.
BULL22|But it wasn't rising nearly as much as the Amazon.
NEUT23|And even though that that was still rising, the ten week is where we really put.
BEAR24|Our emphasis is on it was declining.
BEAR25|That's why that double Week had to pull back to support where Amazon's weekly breakout.
BULL26|Held the highs here and consolidated that one.
BEAR27|And Google because of those declining 10 week pullback to test happen.
NEUT28|The SMF Weekly Pro trader bar.
BULL29|And as it flattens out and turns around, that means that it will get stronger like the Amazon trade.
NEUT30|And every shakedown drop down to support is to be aggressively bought because the difference between the two trends right now in the weekly is that this one is stronger and this one is working on getting stronger.
NEUT31|And you need to know the characteristics of these trends.
NEUT32|And basically I'm not going to go into all of the other indicators.
NEUT33|They already know that the SMF Pro trading students.
NEUT34|So I just want you to know that as we flatten out here like this, one is going upward slightly when that one does.
NEUT35|It were very aggressive and that this is a weekly doji.
NEUT36|That means that we would gap up.
BULL37|We would break out that high there.
BULL38|If we break that high out, that means that ten week is going to flatten out and we're going to be big time buyers.
NEUT39|Say I've been given a gift.
NEUT40|That's the difference between the two weekly trends.
NEUT41|"Add once again stock market funding.com home to the professional home to the investor and home to everyone alike."""
