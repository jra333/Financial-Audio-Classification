NEUT0|"""It's clear and I'm going to try to get a short here on HIMX."
NEUT1|I have an order in for 2500 shares at 12:11.
NEUT2|I believe that's where that white line is.
NEUT3|Yep, white line.
NEUT4|So that will be where my order entry is at to try to short obviously been bearish starting to bottom out here and come back up, but the overall chart you know is bare so I'd like to think that I'm shorting into some strength that's just going to be end up being a dead cat bounce that can at least roll over a little bit.
NEUT5|I won't go for a huge killing or anything like that, but.
BULL6|You know, so I'd like my odds up here of being able to get at least a little micro move to the downside that allow me to score profit so you can see it's heading up here.
NEUT7|Make it a nice move.
NEUT8|Let's see if it can come up.
NEUT9|The rest of the way, actually, I'm going to change that, 'cause usually have 1210 is broken.
NEUT10|Then stocks have the tendency to pop, so I'm going to change that to 12:14.
NEUT11|And let's see how high did it go?
NEUT12|Did I just?
BULL13|Went up to 1212 and now it's pulling back so it looks like I just psyched myself out of my own trade here.
NEUT14|Let's see if it wants to head back up there or not.
NEUT15|Or let's see if this is the move that I was hoping to get and I just like I said, psych myself out of it.
NEUT16|It's looking like this is the move that I wanted to see happen, especially if it goes down there and hits the $12.00 mark, since that's where I would have liked to have covered.
NEUT17|So let's see what happens, there's 1202's.
NEUT18|There's 12 ones.
NEUT19|And there are so alright, I'm going to post this video anyways, be just as a great example of.
NEUT20|I mean, you saw what I wanted to do.
NEUT21|I wanted to get in at 12:11.
BULL22|It went up and hit as high as 1212 so I nailed the entry point within a penny.
NEUT23|Except then I psych myself out, change my order and now you can see that it's rolling over very nicely.
NEUT24|I would have been out at 12, but still you can see pulled back just like I wanted it too.
NEUT25|So I'm going to leave it at that.
NEUT26|I will post this as just a educational example of me psyching myself out of the trade.
NEUT27|So yeah, lesson learned.
NEUT28|You know, when you know charts, you gotta trust the charts.
BEAR29|Obviously I didn't trust it there and you can see it costs me a very nice entry point and trade.
NEUT30|So kind of is what it is.
NEUT31|If you don't know how to use charts or interested in learning, you know I'd encourage you to check out my blog at claytrader.com.
NEUT32|Lots of free stuff there, video charts.
NEUT33|And then I also do offer some educational courses along with a trading group you can hang out with me and other traders during the day.
NEUT34|Stay on top of markets, market movers, stocks that are bouncing, breaking out, all that good stuff in real time so.
NEUT35|Check it out.
NEUT36|Very cost effective, less than a Cup of coffee a week.
NEUT37|You know, $99.00 for the whole year, which breaks down to, I think, $1.90 cents per week.
NEUT38|So super affordable and I guess I'm just talking and rambling on, 'cause I'm still watching this and saying well, that would have been such a nice little trade, but it is what it is.
NEUT39|You know I'm not going to print sit here and pretend like I'm a flawless trader so I will post this 'cause sometimes the best ways to learn are from mistakes like I just made so hopefully learn something.
NEUT40|"Remember, just trust the chart."""
