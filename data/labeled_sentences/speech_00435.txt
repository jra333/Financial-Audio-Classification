NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol SKLZ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but very nice move today and this one.
NEUT5|I mean, I've been think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down there, but ultimately close all the way up there.
BULL6|Granted did pull back from its size, but still relatively speaking from where the price was to was able to battle back up to good solid move.
NEUT7|But that does not bring about the valid question.
NEUT8|Is there any sort of true power behind this woman?
NEUT9|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat bounce that move and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind or one single area.
NEUT12|In that area is right down here at 25.
NEUT13|Why is 25 so important?
NEUT14|And I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation.
NEUT15|Saying if the price were to come down in 25, behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT16|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where the price just was.
NEUT17|I mean not to insult your intelligence but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly a sign of true power, true strength, or anything like that.
NEUT18|However, to be fair, no pricing just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner.
NEUT19|Then start to work to way back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden what you have well.
NEUT21|You have a set of those right there.
NEUT22|You would have those lows down there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps where you go now, you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT23|And that's the name of the game.
BULL24|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT25|And in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $25 as far as areas of resistance are concerned main battleground to watch moving forward all about that purple line there, the 50.
NEUT26|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT27|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself lower and lower.
NEUT28|But as of right now it is valued at 2763.
NEUT29|But like I said.
BEAR30|That is a moving average, so that value is going to decrease as time goes by, so keep a close eye on that.
NEUT31|But All in all, any angle you look at it very impressive bounds today, not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this balance moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL35|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT41|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT44|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
