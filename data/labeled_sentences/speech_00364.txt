BULL2|Stop touching an all time high today and now they're out with earnings that Miles Adlin is the numbers first mouse and the stock up another 6%.
BULL3|Here's John, another company reporting better than expected results on the top and the bottom line so the bottom line adjusted earnings per share for sales force in its most recent quarter.
BULL4|Dollar and 44th St was looking for something closer to $0.67 so basically double the expected per share profit their revenues 5.15 billion in the most recent quarter.
NEUT5|.9 billion is what the street was looking for.
NEUT6|An really.
BULL7|The guidance seems to be the most positive part of a very positive overall.
BULL8|Report 20.7 to $20.8 billion for the full fiscal years with sales force now expects the company had seen revenues closer to $20 billion for the full year.
BULL9|So again, 29% growth in the second quarter.

BULL11|Now more than 6% now six and a half percent 230 bucks a share the day after it was added to the Dow and enjoyed a 3% rally during the session to a record high.
BULL12|So again, as you mentioned, good 24 hours here from Marc Benioff and the team at Salesforce.
BULL13|Yeah Kiko, it's been a very strong 24 hours here for Salesforce, but taking a look at some of those numbers, I mean we've seen so many companies pulled their guidance, but this is a company that has had as performed very well over the last several months and confident enough to give at these to give guidance here, that's.
BULL14|Better than what the street was expecting on many fronts.
NEUT15|Yeah it.
NEUT16|It's easy to see why right?
NEUT17|When you think about some of these stocks that have benefited the cells, is Salesforce certainly one of them?
NEUT18|Especially given just the migration to the cloud?
BULL19|We've talked so much about companies that are accelerating their digitization.
NEUT20|This is the kind of company that will only benefit from the back of that.
NEUT21|And certainly there is a lot of competition, and I think increasingly in this space.
NEUT22|You know, we've talked about other cloud players as well from the likes of Google.
NEUT23|Obviously a WS, but there's enough what we've seen over the last few months.
BULL24|There is enough demand to Goa.
NEUT25|Around and really, if you think about just the demand alone.
NEUT26|I mean that right now it seems like the Sky is the limit right?
BULL27|Because we have just seen the kind of growth over the last few months and even before that we saw strength in this space.
BULL28|So you know, sales for certainly coming off of another really strong quarter, and I think it's just interesting to see how these stocks have performed throughout the pandemic because they have really become through the safe havens that we have seen.
NEUT29|Sort of investors crowd into when everything else is uncertain because that growth story, no matter what you say about the valuation of tech.
BULL30|Rose story still remains intact.
NEUT31|You know, Kiko, I would just add to that Salesforce is not a.
BULL32|It's not a zoom it it has not massively benefited from the shift to remote work.
NEUT33|And obviously it's it serves other businesses.
NEUT34|So these outstanding results on the surface.
