BULL0|"""Alright Matt, as as we do every week, we're going to wrap up here with one to watch again."
NEUT1|Earning season is in full throttle now.
NEUT2|What is your one to watch for the coming week?
NEUT3|I'm watching New York Community Bancorp ticker symbol NYSE be their regional lender based in New York.
NEUT4|Their primary business is loaning out on rent controlled New York apartment buildings.
NEUT5|The reason that I'm really interested in what they have to say.
NEUT6|They are a business that does not react well to.
NEUT7|Rate higher interest rates.
NEUT8|In contrast to many banks, they have a higher cost of capital.
NEUT9|Most of their deposits.
NEUT10|Our interests are interest paying and their model.
NEUT11|Just because their loan portfolio is mostly these loans on rent controlled buildings.
NEUT12|There's not much demand for those when interest rates start to rise, so they're stuck with this portfolio of loans that were made when interest rates are really low, their cost of capital starts rising.
BEAR13|Excuse me, so their stocks just been pummeled lately.
NEUT14|Now it pays almost a 7% dividend.
NEUT15|It should be a big big beneficiary of the bank reform bill because they're right in that $50 billion as asset range that got deregulated so.
NEUT16|I was a shareholder.
NEUT17|I got rid of it a little while ago, but I might jump back in depending depending on when things look like they're going to start to turn around.
BULL18|OK, great.
NEUT19|I'm going to take a look at Markel Insurance ticker MCL.
NEUT20|They're slated to release earnings on Wednesday the 24th.
NEUT21|I'm sure most listeners are familiar with the name Markel.
NEUT22|It's what we commonly refer to as our baby, Berkshire, an insurance company built very much in that same mold.
NEUT23|I own shares very happy to own more if I get the opportunity to buy a compelling valuation.
NEUT24|And it too is a member of that small business.
NEUT25|Big investment back basket that I put out a little while back.
NEUT26|"So be interested to see what Tom, Gaynor and Company have to say on Wednesday."""
