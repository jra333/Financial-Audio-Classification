NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead when we give you the insights you need to stay on top of this ever changing world.
BEAR3|The surge in new coronavirus cases, especially in the South and Southwest, has observers worried that the nascent economic revival will be disrupted or stopped altogether.
BEAR4|Several states have slowed or reversed 3 opening of their economies.
BEAR5|If the economy is seriously disrupted, that will hit the stock market, which has been booming in anticipation.
BULL6|That overall things are on a very positive upswing.
BEAR7|The concerns are genuine, but the swelling and reported cases won't halt the recovery.
NEUT8|Nationwide.
NEUT9|It will slow it in places, but it won't stop it.
BULL10|There have been major movements in easing restrictions such that economic activity is on the upswing.
BEAR11|We see it in growing manufacturing activity, for instance, and in the unexpectedly rapid decline and.
BEAR12|Unemployment.
BULL13|Obviously sectors like restaurants, bars, theaters, theme parks and air travel will painfully lag, but the general economy will continue to expand.
BEAR14|The surprising bulge in new COVID-19 cases comes primarily for more extensive testing and from people, especially younger ones, who think there are mortal crowding together socially without wearing masks.
NEUT15|The far wider testing shows that the death rate from COVID-19 is about one out of 400 and no surprise.
BULL16|Concentrated among the elderly and those with serious, pre-existing conditions, the stock market has been positive because of the belief that the economic recovery won't be seriously disrupted.
BULL17|It is helped to bike progress in battling this dread disease.
NEUT18|For example, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals announced yesterday that is beginning later stage testing of a COVID-19 drug.
NEUT19|Overall, there are 260 treatments being studied now, and 179 vaccines are in development.
NEUT20|And 17 are now in clinical testing.
NEUT21|What is more likely to impact stocks as the election campaign heats up is the question of what kind of economic environment we will have next January.
