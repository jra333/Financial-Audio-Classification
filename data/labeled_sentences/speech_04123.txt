NEUT2|But before that I'll show you the stock of the week.
NEUT3|This week I picked Intel for you.
NEUT4|As you can see, Intel has an average growth rate of 10% and a dividend of 2.5%.
BULL5|The risk analysis shows us that Intel is a solidly growing company over the last five years I am now buying Intel in three batches.
NEUT6|The first batch now and the next batch.
BEAR7|If Intel falls 10% more once Intel returns to its fair value, you can expect a 46% increase in the share price.
NEUT8|OK, now we come to the mentioned competition.
NEUT9|I am currently planning another series of videos.
