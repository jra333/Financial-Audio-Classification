NEUT0|"""So we want to bring in RBCS lead Internet analyst Mark Mahaney on Netflix this morning."
BULL1|Good to see a mark.
BULL2|Good morning, Carl.
NEUT3|You like to say your long and strong on this name.
NEUT4|It's been trading sideways and we see the action today.
NEUT5|What what do you?
NEUT6|What do you put as the primary reason?
NEUT7|Is this about content or is this about price churning?
NEUT8|I think it has to be both of those.
NEUT9|It sounds like he was more about content not having a strong content slate in Q2.
NEUT10|Maybe a really good question for management in hindsight, is why do a price increase in in the teeth of a weak content quarter?
NEUT11|But that's the that's that's looking less looking backwards.
NEUT12|It seems like both of those are issues.
NEUT13|You have to think about near term.
NEUT14|What that means is that I think the market is going to be deeply skeptical of this company's ability to reach its sub numbers.
NEUT15|That's implied in their guide about 7,000,000 Subs.
NEUT16|New Subs paid Subs in the September quarter.
BEAR17|9 million in the December quarter, the market is going to be sceptical on their ability to do that, especially with the Disney launch.
NEUT18|So our guess is near term the stock probably is dead money.
NEUT19|I'm going to step back and make two points.
NEUT20|Medium term.
BULL21|The revenue growth for this year is going to be the same as it was for the last five years.
BULL22|You have six years in a row of 35% revenue growth and long term we think the thesis is well intact.
NEUT23|Obviously streaming is where the growth is, or else you wouldn't have these other competitive launches, and Netflix will always have this scale advantage over anybody else.
NEUT24|For how long would you expect it to be dead money?
NEUT25|I don't think I think it's I think you get maybe a small, really friendly on them just making the sub numbers in the September quarter because that's still going to be printed prior to the Disney launch.
NEUT26|And then I think the stock could still be range bound through the December quarter and possibly through the March quarter because the concern is if if we want to know what's going to, what's the impact of the Disney launch on the Netflix sub.
BULL27|So I think there's modest upside.
NEUT28|I don't think there's a big boom move up in the stock until possibly the off the March quarter results in both of that.
NEUT29|That does require them to be able to hit these sub numbers.
NEUT30|The next two quarters.
BEAR31|Mark, you mentioned being sceptical, or at least the market potentially being sceptical of their ability to hit their subscriber projections.
BEAR32|Are you given they didn't even face competition in this quarter and we saw Subs actually declined domestically.
NEUT33|I just wonder what the world is really going to look like when they actually are, and when conceivably, a consumer we thought had elasticity in terms of their ability to pay price or the company did.
NEUT34|Perhaps the consumer not as quite willing to to continue to watch prices go up and or more and more of their wallet dedicated to streaming.
NEUT35|You know you look.
NEUT36|We temper our enthusiasm a little bit, but there are some of the facts that we know about for the back half of this year.
NEUT37|What we just learned is that original content, big hits, drive Subs.
NEUT38|So what's coming in the back half of this year?
NEUT39|There are three most popular shows are being renewed in the back half of this year or the re launches are coming out.
NEUT40|Stranger Things, Orange is the new Black and 13th reasons why that's in the English language in the Spanish language you have possibly poppell that money Heist show an elite a those are the two most popular Spanish language shows.
NEUT41|In the back half of the year, and then finally their biggest Indian show show in India.
NEUT42|Sacred Games is being relaunched in the second half of this year.
BULL43|"So in terms of if content is what drives Subs contents coming in the second half of the year, this is going to be the strongest contents like they've had in a long time."""
