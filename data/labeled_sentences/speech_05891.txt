NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up everybody?"
NEUT1|Welcome back with December coming around the corner everyone is talking about the Christmas rally are we going to have a Christmas rally?
NEUT2|How many times in the past have we had a Christmas rally?
NEUT3|Exactly how predictable is this?
NEUT4|So in this video I'm going to be going back in history and I've mapped out all Christmas is in the past ten years with the green line being a Christmas uptrend which is not always the case.
NEUT5|Sometimes it starts off with a big blood bath which is usually followed by an uptrend.
NEUT6|So I'm just going to change the line graph.
NEUT7|So like I said, every green.
NEUT8|Or red line I've put in here represents the period from December into January.
NEUT9|Last Christmas was a straight up front and the year before that absolutely obliterated when I'm pointing these out guys.
NEUT10|Keep in mind of what's going on before the crash.
BEAR11|You know, as you can see here, we went into December, extremely bearish and then as December hits, the trend continued hard.
BULL12|The year before that solid uptrend went, so parabolic into February that it got.
NEUT13|Absolutely flawed.
NEUT14|The year before that, we started with a bang, ended with a bang.
BEAR15|So the year before that that looks nasty.
NEUT16|Man that does not look pretty same thing.
NEUT17|Look how we built up to this moment around mid August.
BEAR18|We had a solid drop 11% on the S&P 500 which is crazy met with impenetrable resistance.
NEUT19|Yeah, before that we started December with the dump and then around mid December followed up with major pump the year before that.
NEUT20|Pretty much the exact same thing until around mid December.
NEUT21|And then we pumped the year before that, we pumped into December and then during Christmas we dumped.
NEUT22|It seems to me from looking at all this data like that is kind of rare right here the year before we start December with a little dump.
NEUT23|But as we get closer and closer to Christmas, the pump continues.
NEUT24|So I don't need to go over.
NEUT25|All of these is pretty obvious guys.
BEAR26|The year before that we had an uptrend.
NEUT27|The year before that we had an uptrend and yeah that goes back ten years and I'm going to do a calculation.
NEUT28|Just for fun, take it as you will.
NEUT29|I'm going to calculate the average ROI return on investments over the past ten years when considering the Christmas rally.
NEUT30|OK, the moment of truth bomb the average medium over the past 10 Christmases, from December to January is about 2.3% on the S&P 500, which, if you factor that into you, know more volatile stocks.
NEUT31|It's going to be a lot more than two point 3%, but this was just for fun.
NEUT32|Obviously, anything can happen.
NEUT33|Every Christmas is its own certain situation.
NEUT34|If you want my honest opinion, I say we're going into Christmas with a nice setup.
BEAR35|As I showed you before in all, the like negative return Christmas months leading up to December the charts always seemed very unhealthy.
NEUT36|Look if I didn't know anything about this pandemic in this entire year 2020 and I just saw this chart.
NEUT37|My bet would be that we're going to end Christmas with a bang.
NEUT38|Don't take my word for it.
NEUT39|Do your own research.
NEUT40|But I hope this brings more clarity to you in case you know you haven't experienced the holiday season.
NEUT41|Sometimes I would say most of the time it works out, but sometimes it's a **** show at the end of the day you all need to decide what you're going to do with your money.
BULL42|"Thanks guys, for watching peace up."""
