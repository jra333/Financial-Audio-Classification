NEUT0|"""What's up guys, it's your boy will back with another video today."
NEUT1|Not to give you guys some key levels to look forward to on ticker symbol, CHD K and where I see this start going in the future.
NEUT2|And also I did get in on this play today that I sent out on my Patreon team.
NEUT3|So make sure you guys check that link out and down below if you want buy sell alerts to know when I'm buying and selling stocks.
NEUT4|And also makes you like the video with the subscriber internal post notifications so you don't miss any updates.
NEUT5|OK, so this resistance I still have here at 2.4.
NEUT6|This is where I think when price comes up.
NEUT7|This is why I think we might see some selling pressure Now if we don't see any selling pressure right here and it just runs through it, I think we will for sure see prices go above $3 absolutely if it runs through this level.
NEUT8|But officials some resistance and start coming back down then we will have to wait to see whenever he wants to come above.
NEUT9|This level is when we can get Ultra bullish and see about $3.
NEUT10|But right now it hasn't really been doing anything.
BULL11|We did get in today to try to catch up movement.
NEUT12|That I sent out to my Patreon page.
NEUT13|So I'm trying to see if we get that movement tomorrow or next week, but if it does fall below.
NEUT14|154 then I would just get out the play, right?
NEUT15|Like I said, I only do by one percent 2% of my whole portfolio and penny stocks.
NEUT16|So say it does fall below here it won't bother me.
NEUT17|I'll just get out and find another opportunity.
NEUT18|Right?
NEUT19|'cause there are thousands of stocks you can play it.
NEUT20|You don't want to get hung up on one stock and you don't want to get caught up in hype.
NEUT21|OK, you want to get caught up in a healthy uptrend.
BEAR22|This was not healthy as you can see it needed to pull back and now it's just trading sideways so.
NEUT23|Have this support level 159 and isupport Lowell 154.
NEUT24|It is holding these levels as you can see came down here.
BEAR25|This low was 157.
BEAR26|So .02 cents off.
NEUT27|That's almost perfect.
BEAR28|The support boom came down close again.
NEUT29|Reject it came down right here.
BEAR30|Reject it came down here rejected.
BULL31|So these are key support levels so I'm watching it closely and hopefully we do get up movement past $2.00.
NEUT32|'cause that is my exit price on the shares that we got today.
NEUT33|But this is my ultimate entry exit price right here.
NEUT34|I want to see how I reacted this level.
NEUT35|OK and I want to see if it breaks through this level and starts going lower.
NEUT36|So these are my two key points.
BULL37|I'm really looking forward to.
NEUT38|As you can see is kind of just trading.
NEUT39|In between there, so we have to watch this thought closely.
NEUT40|'cause I do think they move is coming.
NEUT41|So this is it for this video.
BULL42|Hope you guys liked it.
NEUT43|Remember another recommendation bar.
NEUT44|So anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT45|"So do not trade anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
