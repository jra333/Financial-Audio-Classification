BEAR0|"""Bitcoin, my bad boyfriend."
NEUT1|Are you still a big believer in crypto?
NEUT2|Yeah, you know, Hadley, you're right.
BEAR3|It is a bad boyfriend and and I'll tell you what's really emerging as a bit of an issue problem challenge.
NEUT4|Institutions have not yet really engaged in Bitcoin as a property.
NEUT5|You can believe it as an asset, property, currency, whatever it is.
BEAR6|It's still really nowhere in the institutional portfolio and the problem we're having with it.
BEAR7|And since I last talked to, it's only gotten worse.
NEUT8|You know we have compliance on large institutions.
NEUT9|We have covenants around how assets are made, whether carbon is burned, whether it's human rights involved, whether it's made in China, all these issues that have now come to the fore on Bitcoin institutions will not buy coin minded China coin mined using coal to burn for electricity, coin minded countries and sanctions on them and all of a sudden there's this huge demand.
NEUT10|Are Virgin coin with the Providence known?
NEUT11|This is a really interesting problem and I see over the next year or two, two kinds of coin blood coins with China clean coin mined sustainably.
NEUT12|In countries that use hydroelectricity, not cool.
NEUT13|I'm going on the side of clean coin.
NEUT14|I'm buying assets inside of minors.
NEUT15|They can do that.
BULL16|I'm working very hard to make sure every coin I own is compliant because after I declared my interest in getting a 3% waiting I got.
NEUT17|Inundated from institutions saying wait a second.
NEUT18|Are you buying blood coin from China?
NEUT19|Who knew that was a problem?
NEUT20|So is it a national security issue in your view?
NEUT21|No, I I just think that people have just getting into this asset class, watching an increase in value so much over the last year.
NEUT22|Everybody just you know, said it's not real and all of a sudden you know regulators in Canada and Germany and Switzerland and Japan and Australia New Zealand started to open up as an asset class and now the US is looking at it more seriously.
NEUT23|I think the cats out of the bag.
NEUT24|I think it's a real asset class and now you've gotta differentiate what you own.
BEAR25|I mean, it's rather remarkable because we're in a bit of a trade war still, even in the by administration with China.
NEUT26|China mines most of the coin and institutions don't want to own it, not just for the carbon issue, but also human rights issues.
NEUT27|Do they want to support a regime that you know has issues with human rights or Muslims and all that?
NEUT28|Say we don't want we don't endorse this.
NEUT29|You've got this asset class held in Limbo in a remarkable struggle and remarkable situation.
NEUT30|Every day.
NEUT31|I deal with it.
NEUT32|I I say to myself, look, I I bought some coin and they everybody asked me where did come from.
NEUT33|So now I'm not buying coin unless I know where was mine when it was mine.
NEUT34|The Providence of it.
NEUT35|"Not in China, no blood coin for me."""
