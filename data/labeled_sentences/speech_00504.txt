NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Keurig doctor pepper is range between $0.20 per share and $8.87 per share."
NEUT1|How are those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $0.20 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $0.20 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $8.87 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings, a price of $8.87 per share represents the fractional payment.
NEUT4|We would all pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT5|The conservative way to value company this is different now than calculating Keurig Doctor Pepper's price to earnings ratio.
NEUT6|So the next question becomes, well, I have two questions for this company.
NEUT7|What do they do and what are they trading at?
NEUT8|So let's answer the last question, so Keurig doctor Pepper is a conglomerate with headquarters in Burlington, MA.
NEUT9|They sell coffee and they're responsible for the Green Mountain brand, which is interesting.
NEUT10|Now what are they trading at?
NEUT11|$27.73 per share.
NEUT12|Most recently.
NEUT13|With APE ratio of $30.25, which is really high, we you know a threshold for that is the upper threshold is.
BEAR14|20 So $27.73 per share is much higher than our high end that we've calculated for intrinsic value, which means the only reasonable conclusion is that they're overpriced.
NEUT15|So now the alternative one that offers safety of principle with an ample margin of safety, similar return with an even lower risk well.
NEUT16|None other than our Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT17|Now reason I like this index fund is because it will help make you money as opposed to just hoarding or keeping your money in a savings account in some greedy bank.
NEUT18|So over the 10 years over the last 10 years, folks have made 12.98% which is huge.
NEUT19|Look at this low variance low beta.
NEUT20|There isn't that much volatility in this in this fund, it's just a tracking tracker fund for the for the top 500 performing companies, most of them in the United States.
NEUT21|So put your money here.
NEUT22|Until this price becomes more reasonable, specifically until the share price starts trading below a price of $8.87, folks.
NEUT23|It's really that simple, guys.
