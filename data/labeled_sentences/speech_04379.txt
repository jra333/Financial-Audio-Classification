NEUT0|"""A big thing about."
NEUT1|A business is recognized and change.
NEUT2|You know, you know that the the variables are not the same.
NEUT3|You know there's a big thing called the Internet, so it changes the landscape.
NEUT4|Everything.
NEUT5|I think the consumption of music as is at all time high.
BEAR6|But as we see the music business is down.
NEUT7|So something has to be done there.
NEUT8|You know it was a time in music where a hit solved everything.
NEUT9|You just had a hit.
NEUT10|It didn't matter what was going on, you know.
NEUT11|Get ahead an you know it solve everyone's problem for a lot of stuff you know that's that's that's no longer true.
NEUT12|Not today, Ann.
NEUT13|I think you know just having that mentality for so long.
NEUT14|I think it's the music business still stuck in that place because you know.
NEUT15|We haven't figured that.
BEAR16|We haven't figured it out that knappster they made a huge mistake on Napster.
NEUT17|Yeah, well Maps that came along and it was this power sharing thing.
NEUT18|You know at the time we had we had the opportunity to embrace it and this way you can control it.
NEUT19|It was one place but when you stop one nap when you stop Napster we shut down Napster.
NEUT20|Just the arrogance that we had, it made a million apps this now it's impossible to control.
NEUT21|Just just that sort of thinking.
NEUT22|You know, I think in business one, one in the biggest thing is open yourself up for change.
NEUT23|You don't have to change who you are and how you operate, but just you know.
NEUT24|You know, at the landscape is changed and the way we do business has to change somewhat.
NEUT25|Don't have to change who we are.
NEUT26|"We have to change the way we go about it."""
