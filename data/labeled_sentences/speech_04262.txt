NEUT0|"""I mean, I'll tell you a little bit about the company teach you how they make their money."
NEUT1|Get into some fundamentals, and then let you know if I think it's a buy quickly.
NEUT2|Guys, don't forget to subscribe to expand your knowledge on the stock market and personal finance, or at least pretend that we have no idea of what Coca Cola the company is.
NEUT3|But to be honest, if you don't know what cocoas I didn't even know what part of the world you have from somewhere in the middle of the Himalayas or something so Coca Cola is the world's largest beverage company and also one of the most well known brands.
NEUT4|They own 500 different brands that sell over 3500 different beverages.
NEUT5|This includes four of the top five soft drinks in the world.
NEUT6|Coca Cola, Diet Coke, FTA and Sprite.
NEUT7|If you drinking a soft drink right now, chances are it's probably owned by Coca Cola, so port.
NEUT8|In simple terms, it's a gigantic beverage company, so there are two main ways that Coca Cola generates its revenue.
NEUT9|The obvious way is that they make the product say a Coca Cola.
NEUT10|Can Felicia say $0.20 and then they sell it for a high margin?
NEUT11|I'd say just a dollar.
NEUT12|Pretty simple.
NEUT13|This is called the finished product way of generating revenue and accounts for 60% of Coke's total revenue.
NEUT14|The other way, Coke makes his money is selling syrup to soda fountain operators like Burger King.
NEUT15|This accounts for 40% of the revenue, so a pretty simple business model.
NEUT16|Let's get into Coca Cola's numbers.
NEUT17|Once you have Coke is currently selling for price of 44.53 dollars an for this one.
BULL18|Sure, you're gonna get $0.29 of earnings year.
NEUT19|Not a lot.
BULL20|And this gives it a very high PE ratio of 152.5 on the odd occasion.
BULL21|I wouldn't mind investing in a company like this as long as their earnings and revenue expected to grow by a lot.
NEUT22|Let's look at the earnings.
BEAR23|Yep, all I can see is a massive decrease in earnings.
BEAR24|In 2015, cokehead earnings, or 7.35 billion and in 2017 is decreased to 1.25 billion.
NEUT25|That is crazy, hence why they've got a pig ratio of 2.81.
NEUT26|About the only thing going for the stock is as pretty.
NEUT27|High dividends of $1.56, but even then we must question whether they can afford to pay their dividend with the only earning $0.29 per share and we all know this stock is the company that made Warren Buffett a lot of money.
NEUT28|But he purchased the back in 1988 when I was still growing and the price was a lot cheaper to Paula Knorr.
NEUT29|Guys Coke for me is a stock that I'm going to stay far away from.
NEUT30|If you're a value investor growth, investor momentum investor or any type of investor.
NEUT31|I don't see why you would want to buy it, but hey, who knows if you are buying the stock, let me know in the comments.
NEUT32|I would love to hear why.
BULL33|I hope this video is helpful.
NEUT34|Guys, if you do like it don't forget to leave a like on the video.
BULL35|I always appreciate it.
NEUT36|I'll catch you next time you've run.
NEUT37|"See you later."""
