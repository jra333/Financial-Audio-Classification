NEUT0|"""Sending us for more."
NEUT1|Paul Mcculley, former PIMCO chief economist senior Fellow at Cornell University, Paul, always good to see.
BULL2|Thanks for for joining us.
NEUT3|I guess we've had sort of almost 24 hours to digest this now.
NEUT4|Is is the bigger part of this story, the sort of way that this spat kind of became public as opposed to the decision itself.
BEAR5|Yes, I think it's very unfortunate how it unfolded because I think both Treasury Secretary Manoosh and as well as Fed Chair Powell are right.
NEUT6|It's the issue is the matter of timing.
BEAR7|I think it was really terrible timing for Mr Mnuchin to do what he did yesterday, and I don't buy the argument that it didn't have a political favor to it.
NEUT8|At the same time, I agree with him that ultimately it's Congress that should be in the.
NEUT9|Grant making business and that the emergency.
NEUT10|Where the Fed and the Treasury had to work together in the lending business will come to an end.
BEAR11|So I think it's a very unfortunate spat, but looking out six months I don't think it's a big deal.
NEUT12|You said you don't buy the fact that there wasn't a political flavor here.
NEUT13|What do you mean by that policy?
NEUT14|If you think this was a deliberate attempt to sabotage President, elect Biden's economic tools.
NEUT15|I don't think it was a deliberate attempt to do so, but certainly they didn't have to do it now.
NEUT16|Actually, they limit it to a degree.
NEUT17|The optionality or flexibility that the new Treasury Secretary would have.
NEUT18|So that's what I mean by political, because a good, peaceful, smooth transition shouldn't be throwing sand into your successors job, and I think that's what he did.
NEUT19|So that's why I mean it had a flavor of a political action.
NEUT20|Subsequently, I don't disagree with the notion that.
NEUT21|Congress needs to be in the business of spending money because the feds in the lending business, not the spending business.
NEUT22|If we look at the economy right now, pulled, does it need more fiscal spending or more monetary policy stimulus in the short term?
NEUT23|And which is more likely?
NEUT24|And does this latest spat actually slightly increase the likelihood that the Fed will act at the next meeting?
NEUT25|Actually, I think what the economy needs foremost is fiscal policy.
NEUT26|Monetary policy is all in doing everything that it can and what this economy needs is fiscal transfers actually grants from Congress to Main Street.
NEUT27|It doesn't need sophisticated lending facilities to support Wall Street.
NEUT28|So what we need right now is Congress to act now.
NEUT29|You ask, you know what what the odds are on Congress?
NEUT30|Acting in the short run, I don't know, but as an economic matter that is unambiguously the imperative, and I don't think necessarily at all that it puts pressure on the Fed to do more in December.
NEUT31|In fact, if anything, I would argue the opposite, because essentially Mr. Mnuchin just took away some of the feds ammo which he asked the right to do because he has the equity in the special purpose.
NEUT32|Lending facilities.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
