NEUT0|"""Yo when Christine, what's going on?"
NEUT1|It is February 26, 2021.
NEUT2|Market is officially closed.
NEUT3|How do you do?
NEUT4|How to do this week?
BULL5|Hopefully you did alright 2 weeks ago.
NEUT6|I gave you the warning that the market could start going through some turmoil and we could be just on the tips of what could happen.
NEUT7|So let's check out how to market.
BEAR8|It could potentially go down for the future.
NEUT9|Today.
NEUT10|The SMP closed at 3811.
NEUT11|15 alright, 3811 and 15 cents is what the market closed at record high is 39 fifty 43.
NEUT12|Let's check out how it closed, what we're looking at is the year chart on SMP an we have a nice little rounded top that could potentially happen.
NEUT13|We need to obviously see if we test this level here at that 3700 area.
NEUT14|I think we'll get back to that 3700.
BULL15|We probably will bounce from there, and if we do, we may have the humble beginnings of a head and shoulder pattern.
BEAR16|And if we have that pattern we are likely going to move lower and a price target from there is 37.
NEUT17|Let's see, that's going to be.
NEUT18|About 34, so let's check out the 3400 level.
BULL19|We got some solid support around there at this area.
NEUT20|Slice through a couple of times, but that will be the level that it would likely move to.
NEUT21|If that head and shoulder pattern form.
NEUT22|So that's the SMP.
NEUT23|Let's go ahead and check out the Russell.
NEUT24|Ticker IWM this is the one that I use as my gauge for the market trend and what we have is our very first close beneath the 20 day moving average.
NEUT25|This typically will signal that we are in at least a pause state for the trend and what I had mentioned about two weeks ago is that I'm looking for the market to actually start to test out this strength.
NEUT26|It hasn't done so.
BULL27|Yet an we're maybe in the stages of doing that, so if this does continue to move lower, we see that a test it out as old highs here and bounced, I think, will at least have a chance next week to start to retrace this level in tesseron at 2:15.
NEUT28|So we're going to watch that level next week to see how it breaks down.
BULL29|If it holds up, that's a good sign.
NEUT30|If it doesn't.
NEUT31|Then we know we have a good chance of moving lower and with chances are we're going to move down to 200, so that is SMP that is IWM and that is a Rep so hope you checked out the new episode of Stocks and Boss teach you all the steps on how to get a raise.
