BULL0|"""Welcome back to fast money."
BULL1|Apple shares rallying today on the back of an upgrade at UBS are called the day.
BULL2|The firm slapping a buy rating on the stock, upping the price target by 27 bucks to 115 a share.
BEAR3|Shares are 122 right now.
NEUT4|Analysts noting apples EV car ambitions haven't been priced into the stock, so let's let's try this one.
BULL5|What struck me here is that big cap tech overall had a very good day.
BULL6|We saw the NASDAQ really make some pretty strong advances.
BEAR7|This in the face of a 10 year yield, the top 1.74% Tim.
NEUT8|Yeah, you know, look if you look at the triple Q.
BEAR9|So the NASDAQ 100 against the SNP.
NEUT10|A lot of that, you know.
NEUT11|Call it destruction.
NEUT12|Relative value wise was put in.
NEUT13|I think the you know through about two weeks ago since that point especially.
BEAR14|Also if you look at semiconductors they performed the SNP by almost 8% over the last couple weeks in terms of Apple on the charts it's trading below the 50 for the longest period it's had since the middle part of 2019 to the extent that you need a catalyst you need another story to talk about outside of 5G.
NEUT15|And refresh, you know, maybe this is the story, but I I just don't think we're ready to ascribe a particular value.
NEUT16|I think this story with Apple is 1 where this is going to be a longer refresh cycle and 5G is a gift that will keep giving for a couple years.
NEUT17|I want to make a correction here.
NEUT18|UBS raises price target to 142, which makes a whole lot more sense than 115, that's for sure.
NEUT19|20 bucks above where it closed guy.
NEUT20|Where do you send an Apple at these levels?
NEUT21|There's never listen.
NEUT22|Analysts are never going to get fricasseed for upgrading Apple, so 142.
NEUT23|I mean, if you get there on the $6 are going to earn your talking about a name with a 26 multiple, which people seem to be comfortable with, the market seems to be comfortable with.
NEUT24|I don't think the 10 year yield story is that.
BEAR25|Is that detrimental to Apple?
NEUT26|But in terms of NASDAQ overall, I think it's acclimatising that's getting used to these lofty levels, and as long as it continues to sort of get used to the 20,000 foot level.
NEUT27|It'll be easy to get to the summit, which, by the way happens, I think in May.
NEUT28|For Mount Everest, you get to a certain level, though I'd ever swear you're in the death zone and we're getting precariously close to it.
BEAR29|I think in terms of yields, so I'm still of the belief yields go higher, and I do think it's going to be very negative for the NASDAQ.
NEUT30|At a certain point, some people see climatization, some people see frog in boiling water, but we'll have to see on that.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
