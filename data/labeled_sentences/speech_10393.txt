BEAR0|"""From the volatility peaked through the end of 2008, the VIX moves steadily lower."
BULL1|Well, the S&P 500 made a nice pop.
NEUT2|And then spent two months turning sideways.
NEUT3|So that was like, yeah, OK, there back then the feared Pete.
NEUT4|We process the payment from Lehman going under.
NEUT5|We are.
NEUT6|The banks are being bailed out, but we still had no idea how long the crisis would be and when it would end.
NEUT7|Sebastian points out that we're seeing a very similar pattern right now.
BEAR8|Back then, as we gradually realized, the extent of the carnage and the SNP moved lower again.
BEAR9|This time more slowly without a big spike in the VIX, we already braced ourselves for more weakness, so the winter 2009 meltdown didn't freak people out the way the fall 2008 meltdown did.
NEUT10|So you can see the VIX kind of didn't react.
NEUT11|As Sebastian says it, we're going through the same thing right now, only faster he thinks we're now in the December to January may time frame.
NEUT12|OK, so if you want to December January time frame, then we know that we're looking at a pretty decent time.
NEUT13|OK, we're going to get up there.
NEUT14|We start going up.
BEAR15|But remember, this was this was down, I'm sorry we're headed into.
BEAR16|I don't want to say this was good.
BEAR17|This was horrible.
NEUT18|This was the fabled bottom.
BULL19|Alright, that's where the market is no longer scared, but also not yet ready to sustain a rally.
BEAR20|If the financial crisis is any guide, Sebastian is expecting choppy action for the next month.
BEAR21|And by the way, choppy action is not good.
BEAR22|OK, choppy action for the next months as we start to see more hard data about the economy, the layoffs, the baggage is, he thinks we're gonna get hit again.
NEUT23|That's my thesis, people, that's exactly my thesis, I said at the top of the show.
NEUT24|But this big.
NEUT25|But if the VIX doesn't spike the next time the market rolls over, special recommends to be some.
NEUT26|Buying the weakness.
BULL27|In other words, there's no need to chase stocks after this week's rally, Amen, you can afford to be patient and buy the dips, and we saw a lot of tips in this.
NEUT28|20 and you're investing for the long haul.
BULL29|You may get some much better entry points than today.
NEUT30|No need to feel any FOMO here.
NEUT31|I couldn't agree more.
NEUT32|Remember, we could be here all right?
BULL33|'cause the VIX is steady.
NEUT34|And at any given time, you're going to get a little blip up, and that was a fake.
NEUT35|Yep, this was a fake yet get me.
NEUT36|These were all fake outs.
NEUT37|I don't want you to buy a fake out.
NEUT38|I want you to get right here, or at least as close.
NEUT39|Whatever the bottom line, the charts as interpreted by marks about almost put my fist through that.
NEUT40|Do you know that?
NEUT41|But because I'm Jimmy chill, I didn't do that.
NEUT42|The old Jim Cramer would have put his fists right through that and then I would have just gone gotten stitches anyway.
NEUT43|The charges just by Mark Sebastian, the big Fear total collapse, the economy, the stock market.
BEAR44|I think it's been taken off the table.
NEUT45|That's what he says.
NEUT46|That doesn't mean we're ready to roar.
BEAR47|Instead, he's respected choppy market that may give you another leg down as the ugly economic data keeps rolling in.
NEUT48|I think he's got a point.
