BEAR1|Elrond is among the biggest losers in the cryptocurrency market.
BEAR2|A bearish wave has seen both small and large coins correct from their recent highs.
BEAR3|Elron's massive upswing ran into a strong barrier at $225, paving the way to a 60% breakdown below $100.
BULL4|Meanwhile, Bulls seem to be working on a recovery mission as long the primary support holds firmly.
BEAR5|The breakdown from the all time high failed to secure support at the 61.8% for the Nachi retracement level taken between the last swing high at $225 to a swing of $96.20.
BEAR6|The bearish leg progressed under $100 before Elron bounced off the 23.6% fibo.
BEAR7|At the time of writing, Elrond is dancing at $140.00 after reclaiming the lost ground above the 100 simple moving average on the four hour chart.
BEAR8|Elron must close the day above this key moving average to sustain the ongoing recovery, notably Massive Buy orders will be triggered if the token steps above either the 61.8% fibo or the 50 simple moving average.
BULL9|The relative strength index on the four hour chart has validated the rebound after bouncing off the oversold area.
BULL10|A continued movement toward the midline will cement the bull's influence over the price.
NEUT11|Elrond is not out of the Woods yet, and therefore it is essential to tread with caution if the uptrend cannot be sustained above the 100 simple moving average on the four hour chart, another retracement will take precedence.
BULL12|The support at the 23.6% Fibo near $95 would also be retested.
NEUT13|A break under this stone may open the Pandora boxes.
BEAR14|Bears rushed to push for losses toward the.
BEAR15|Zelinka price saw a breakdown of the critical level at 0.125 dollars on the four hour chart due to a sudden spike in selling pressure caused by a market wide correction zelinka slice through the 0.125 dollars support barrier provided by the Bollinger bands.
NEUT16|Middle line triggering the Super Trend Indicators cell signal.
BEAR17|Now Zil continues to drop towards the Bollinger bands lower end, which is the next demand level.
BEAR18|The one hour chart presents an additional bearish outlook for Zelinka price due to the breach of the 101 hour Ma.
BEAR19|Moreover, a breakout from the descending triangle pattern suggests a 20% drop, which is the distance from the prices highest point inside the triangle to the flat support.
BEAR20|In this case, Zills 20% correction from the patterns X axis projects $0.10 as the target.
BEAR21|It is worth noting that those illegal price correction towards the said target can be mitigated due to the presence of the 201 hour in May around the 0.107 dollars level.
BEAR22|Therefore, if buyers continue to accumulate zelinka at 0.107 dollars, the resulting spike in buying pressure could push the price higher.
BEAR23|Only have one hour candle stick close above the 101 hour ma at 12 Cent coinciding with the triangle's base will invalidate Silicas bearish thesis.
BEAR24|Subsequent buying pressure projects and retest of the 51 hour ma around a 14 cents level.
