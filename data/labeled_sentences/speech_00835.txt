NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know that she would behave we back with another one."
NEUT1|That's gonna get right into it, you know.
NEUT2|Want to waste nobody time before we do that, let's get this video.
NEUT3|Thumbs up so we can reach more people that they will be touching base on T Alright let's take this thing with TL or why we talked about this stock a few times on the channel so we go too much in deal we're going to just give you are some reassurance that you know we do expect the long term short term and let's see what's going on with this baby.
BEAR4|So Boom theory we down 2.8% today.
NEUT5|Another one point 1% in after hours we open at 2352 the House 2467.
BEAR6|The low was 2228, the 52 week high was $67 and 52 below was 3/25.
NEUT7|So right here we had a crucial point today when we had deal down when we dip down with such that $2.28 level, but right before that that that 2:20 at $22.42 was a crucial level.
BULL8|If we broke through that, that indicates we can follow down and retest is $21.63 that we hit on March 5th during the creation.
NEUT9|Basically the the market is having a recreation from when it had it on March field when it had that correction it took off.
NEUT10|Like it regained itself pretty quickly and Larry the market lower to shake the tree, shaking hands out.
NEUT11|And what's the best way to do that?
NEUT12|Then pull the market our way back to where it was previously on Marshfield and let people don't know where to expect it to go next.
BEAR13|It could be the balance out that's previous support from last creation, or we could go lower.
BEAR14|So I feel we could possibly bounce off this previous creation around this thing could pull back around $21.50.
BEAR15|Twenty $1.60 that that should be the lowest but worst case scenario with rebirth.
BEAR16|Through that 2150 we could pull all the way back to $1718 range and then we could bounce off that and now resistance.
NEUT17|Once we start bouncing up, interior is going to bounce quickly.
BULL18|He's going to recover in a blink of an eye.
NEUT19|So you want to be you want to be loading the boat, adding to your position right about now.
BULL20|So we recover.
NEUT21|I refers to existing point will be around $24.37 soon as we boost the $24.37 will quickly see 25 ninety $26.25 ninety.
NEUT22|Once you reach that level will quickly go up to $2930 range and I last resistance after we hit the 30 range would be around $34.30.
NEUT23|Once we Bush 234 thirty this thing can fly straight.
BULL24|Into the 40s to 50s and probably retest that high of $60.00.
NEUT25|Plus that we hear.
NEUT26|So I also want to bring the attention.
BEAR27|I'm down until right now.
NEUT28|You know, I want to show my losses which are just in which is actually my wings, which all I was down 602 great but I sold about $2000 worth of shares so I can buy more genius brands.
NEUT29|I'm letting you know keeping updating.
NEUT30|So now I got a total cost of 6400 with the average price of $24.66 a share.
BEAR31|The last price for 2298 and I'm down 444.
NEUT32|I'm at 4:42 right now, so that's all I got for this video.
NEUT33|I just want to give you a quick update on Tilray later.
BULL34|I know not dependent this is still a strong strong buy right now and they will recover quickly, so you want to be accumulating shares right now this.
NEUT35|I like that if you like this video.
NEUT36|We post this type stuff every single day.
NEUT37|Consider joining the family.
NEUT38|You should would behave love.
BULL39|"You God bless."""
