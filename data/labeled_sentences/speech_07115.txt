BULL0|"""Hey everyone, and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about sundial growers and we're also going to talk about this very hot.
NEUT2|You know, pretty much cannabis stocks as well.
NEUT3|Tilray ticker TLRY, so one thing is easy to understand about these.
BULL4|They actually were performing absolutely amazing.
BEAR5|If we look at sundial growers for the past month, the instance that it literally went up to as high as $3, which is insane.
NEUT6|If you guys don't know this was a meme stock, OK, when it comes to cannabis stocks.
NEUT7|This was the number one stock that a lot of people basically think of it as a domino effect.
NEUT8|One person hopped in and then the other ones, and it just it wasn't a domino effect where people were just hopping in and you know, it just started going up and then you guys saw the huge pull back and then current.
BEAR9|Right now it is dropping into continues to drop.
BEAR10|Reason why is because the market itself is dropping OK you guys look at the big companies penny stocks.
BEAR11|Everything is dropping a lot of people are buying the dips.
NEUT12|You know it's a great time to buy but sundial growers at the moment it is a dollar.
NEUT13|Even my time making this video obviously it changed by the time you're watching this video before I continue as if yes, enjoy short video straight to the point like this dropping like subscribe and most importantly turn on those post if you guys do not miss out on any of these videos.

BULL18|On Friday and then bouncing back up.
BULL19|So I personally believe that somehow growers is still definitely a really good company to invest in our this.
NEUT20|That's what I'm doing.
NEUT21|OK, I'm buying shares.
NEUT22|Obviously I don't have, you know, a lot here, mostly.
NEUT23|Mostly I buy more of my shares on Weible.
NEUT24|OK, so always keep that in mind that right now a lot of people buying the dips and when it comes to the other one which is going to be until the same thing since he over here, absolutely crazy how fast it was going up and up to a size like 60.
BEAR25|$7.00, which is crazy in the instance of the same pattern that it dropped.
NEUT26|Obviously.
BEAR27|Once again the market dropping as well.
NEUT28|So let me know if you guys think it's definitely a buy for both of these companies, or guessing you guys want to wait and my crashing or my continues to crash, but I hope you guys enjoy.
