NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is your boy will today will be talking about tattoos, Chef ticker symbol TTCF.
NEUT2|I'd like to keep this video short.
BULL3|I'll show you guys some support levels you guys can watch out for as you know it had this good run up would run us.
NEUT4|We'd like to see a pullback and then have this medium pull back right here.
BULL5|This was a good price to get in and had to pull back again so now we're looking for.
BEAR6|I mean they had to run up so now we're looking for that pull back.
NEUT7|Now this one you have to watch for it did have to pull back, but as you can see prices not going higher has been trained in this range.
NEUT8|So you want to be careful for this site stuff like this little chop you up and you'll get caught in this play just waiting, just waiting.
NEUT9|You want to see directional movement like this?
NEUT10|This right here makes the easiest place and this right here.
NEUT11|Just as you waiting and you might as well just wait for a direction either down or up to get into that play.
BEAR12|'cause right here you just really be wasting your time.
BULL13|So they just support levels that I have that I'm looking forward to.
NEUT14|If it drops below this support level, let's make this red.
BEAR15|If it drops below this support level then I see price going all the way down here to around 2150 area.
BEAR16|This level is 2139 but I think prices will come down here.
BEAR17|This tested this as support a lot so I'm thinking it might break this level and come down to this support lower right here.
NEUT18|More definitely, I do want it to come between this area between this 2139 and 20.31 I wanted to trade in this area and also remember make sure you guys like the video subscribe, turn on post notifications.
NEUT19|Then help your boy out.
NEUT20|So the possibility this I will wait right now I'm just waiting to see which direction the stock wants to go.
NEUT21|If it does start making new higher highs then I'll look for some support levels for it to come back down into, and then we can get in on the call option.
BEAR22|But right now I think it's going to break this level.
NEUT23|I want to see how it acts at this price level.
NEUT24|See if it supports it.
BEAR25|Then we maybe can get into see new highs, but ultimately I want to come between these levels and if it falls below this level of 19.6, then I will ultimately turn bearish on the stock and I would just wait to see what price gives me.
NEUT26|But these are my two really amazing support levels that I want to come out down into it.
NEUT27|If it does then I'll start looking for some call options and give us some shares on the stock.
NEUT28|So that's why I'm playing this.
