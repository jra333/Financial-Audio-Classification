BULL2|Thanks for joining.
BULL3|Thanks for watching.
BULL4|Hope you're having a great day.
NEUT5|I want to show you how I made quick $85 and 18 minutes scalp and more importantly it was a benefit to being in the black box stocks trading room with anywhere from between.
NEUT6|3 two 600 trading members at the same time and everybody is allowed to interact and talk.
NEUT7|And it's a great world.
NEUT8|But here check this out.
NEUT9|I have a 49 inch screen where I watch about 12 to 15 stocks at the same time.
NEUT10|Netflix is one of them, but I was doing a few other things.
NEUT11|Help with some members out.
NEUT12|One of the great memories of gang matches.
NEUT13|Hey, keep an eye out on keeping on Netflix.
NEUT14|Downside so I'm showing you the conference here at 2:19 PM I got in.
NEUT15|At 535 bucks or 370, put at two.
NEUT16|3718 minutes later we get out of 620.
BEAR17|That's a $85 profit.
NEUT18|Nothing, nothing great, but hey, it's almost 20% and check it out, though at 2:10 and when he actually mentioned I saw that 9:00 AM across town, the 21 I waited for that confirmation Banger 219 I'm in.
NEUT19|I'm in.
NEUT20|I'm in I'm dropping here, we see, we get a bouncer at the time in real time.
BULL21|I draw support here and on this next candle is 235 #237 I'm out I see some shakiness.
NEUT22|"I just get out and I cover black box stocks baby."""
