NEUT0|"""Well, I think we're still not out of the Woods yet, and it's going to take some time."
BEAR1|Schools haven't fully reopened.
NEUT2|Businesses haven't all gone back to work, and we've seen a number of companies decide to continue providing either the option of working from home for the long term, or plan to work from home on a continuous basis because they realized they were able to continue functioning that way.
BULL3|And all of that has led to a lot of demand for zoom.
NEUT4|The product is very easy to use, and people seem to have really, you know.
BEAR5|Gandanta this technology and that momentum has continued, but there are some signs of this slowing after this fourth quarter.
NEUT6|So what do you think is the biggest obstacle?
NEUT7|Is it the return to the workplace or is it competitors like Cisco and Google and Microsoft?
BULL8|I think Zoom has both, so the company enjoyed some exponential growth in the beginning because one the solution is very easy to use.
NEUT9|People enjoy it.
NEUT10|The pricing was competitive.
BULL11|The freemium model works very well, but we saw Cisco, Microsoft, and Google all really up level their offerings.

NEUT14|Google is of course formidable, and so is Cisco, so that's one side of it.

NEUT16|And with the J&J news, we now have three vaccines in the market.
NEUT17|You do have schools reopening and kids going back to class.
NEUT18|That means less use of zoom and of course, as work does reopen.
NEUT19|Not every company has the luxury to continue.
NEUT20|Working from home, nor the desire, so we're going to have to sort of watch that momentum, and that's why we're seeing from 300 plus percent growth, which is what's expected this quarter, all the way down to potential single and low double digit growth being forecasted by some.
NEUT21|And if that happens, I think there's going to be some concern, but we also have to look at that exponential growth and say some of it got accelerated and now zoom has to find its new legs and how to keep growing going forward.
