NEUT0|"""Bloomberg as a candidate, so this is very interesting."
NEUT1|I'm glad you actually asked that way.
NEUT2|I've met him a couple of times.
NEUT3|He wasn't warm when I met him and I think he needs to warm up.
NEUT4|Personally, I think that people don't vote for pocketbooks or brains.
NEUT5|They vote for hearts and minds.
NEUT6|President Bill Clinton once told me that that America would prefer a leader who strong in wrong.
BULL7|Then we can write so used to be strong, but also likable.
NEUT8|That's it.
NEUT9|If I want to pack a room in the inner city, I've got 4,000,000 clients at Operation Hope for the Packer room, the inner city.
NEUT10|I tell my billionaires coming when Oprah Winfrey came to Atlanta and she came up to to Morehouse.
NEUT11|And gave a lot of money back.
NEUT12|They didn't introduce her as a talk show host, right?
BULL13|They introduced her as the first black billionaire and got a standing ovation.
NEUT14|I think it's the intent of we're talking about here, so I think the one I like that he's an adult in the room.
NEUT15|I think he's going to force the left to come back, sit right there, forced the right to come back and have a rational conversation.
NEUT16|I think that if you can become likable if you can warm up because my population needs to feel you had 12 years to warm up, well, maybe maybe will maybe won't.
NEUT17|You ask me, a question.
NEUT18|Was giving you an answer right?
NEUT19|I think that that I wrote an Article 10 years ago.
NEUT20|If Bill Gates were black.
NEUT21|And I said, basically, Bill Gates were black.
NEUT22|It would be 100 times more important.
BULL23|Respectfully stated that having a black president and I think Obama is fantastic.
NEUT24|By the way.
NEUT25|I mean, fantastic is not the point.
BEAR26|Bill Gates creates 10s of thousands of jobs.
NEUT27|Thousands and thousands of millionaires, a few billionaires, all of which have they look like me?
NEUT28|Well guess what?
NEUT29|Give back where where they came from.
NEUT30|So we need I go the opposite way.
NEUT31|We need 100 billionaires who are black.
NEUT32|100 billionaires were Latino 100 billionaires who are Indian and Asian women so that they can give back massively and create internship set up tuning their communities.
NEUT33|Is it positive positive that he's in the race?
NEUT34|I think it is a net positive if he's about to get it done party, not the Republican Party, not the Democratic Party to get it done.
NEUT35|Party Americans don't think that people.
BEAR36|That they can get it done anymore and that's the problem.
BEAR37|The ladder is broken, so this whole concept that we hate billionaires is actually wrong.
BEAR38|People say, oh, I hate rich people know you.
NEUT39|Don't you hate rich people.
NEUT40|"You become rich."""
