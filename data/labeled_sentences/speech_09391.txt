NEUT0|"""Well, it's it's most egregious in the."
BULL1|Momentum trading by novice investors lured in by.
NEUT2|New types of.
NEUT3|Brokerage operation like Robin Hood.
BEAR4|And I think all of this activity is regrettable.
NEUT5|I think civilization would do better without it.
NEUT6|You'll remember that when the first big bubble came, which was the South Sea bubble in England back in the 1700s, it created such havoc eventually when it blew up.
NEUT7|That England didn't allow.
NEUT8|Hardly any public trading and securities of any companies for decades thereafter.
BEAR9|It just created the most unholy mess.
NEUT10|So human greed and the.
NEUT11|Aggression of the brokerage community creates these bubbles from time to time and I think wise people just stay out of them.
NEUT12|Our next question comes from a chip Patel.
NEUT13|He says Charlie in your past speeches, you have mentioned the term functional equivalent of embezzlement to describe situations where bubbles can form.
NEUT14|Because both parties involved in a bubble believe the asset to be worth more than it truly is, can U.S. Treasury bonds be such a case today and what are the implications since Treasury assets?
NEUT15|Underpin the value of every other asset.
BULL16|Thank you for all you do to educate us.
NEUT17|Well, no, I don't think we have a bubble in Treasury securities.
BEAR18|I think they're a bad investment.
NEUT19|When interest rates are this low and I didn't, I never buy any other than the Daily Journal.
NEUT20|But no, I don't.
NEUT21|I don't think Treasury securities or.
BEAR22|A big problem.
NEUT23|I do think that we don't know what these artificial low interest rates are going to do or how the economy is going to work in the future.
NEUT24|As governments print all this extra money.
NEUT25|And I have the only opinion I have there is that I don't think anybody knows what's going to happen for sure.
BEAR26|Larry Summers has recently been quoted as being worried that we have too much stimulus.
BEAR27|"And I don't know whether he's right or not."""
