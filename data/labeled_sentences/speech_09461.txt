NEUT0|"""It's time for charting futures."
NEUT1|Here's Abigail Doolittle and today, well, you're going in the direction of Commodity Futures.
NEUT2|We are indeed Caroline, but first, let's take a look at the dollar index, 'cause this of course is a big driver of the commodity market.
BEAR3|Commodities being denominated in dollars, and you can see over the last five days down more than 1%, the worst stretch since June, as a handful of emerging market currencies do well.
NEUT4|Of course, the great British pound right now, down five days in a row, be interesting to see whether or not this continues, and if we put this into the context as dollar declined.
NEUT5|The context of a chart that we've been looking at more recently.
BULL6|Once again, we see a beautiful uptrend over the last two years for the dollar index with the 200 day moving average in yellow rising, we also have what's called an ascending triangle here, which has bullish higher lows that tells you that the buyers are more enthusiastic each time it dips down.
BEAR7|Well, it is dipping down right now on to that 200 day moving average still below it.
NEUT8|Right now it looks like this chart could go right back toward the bottom of that range.
NEUT9|Let's call it around 97 or so.
NEUT10|Somewhere in there.
NEUT11|Whether or not that holds will be crucial.
NEUT12|If that were to break, it could really get.
BEAR13|Pretty bearish for the dollar, but to talk more about what the dollar could mean for commodities, I'd like to bring in Tom Thorn hedge fund telemetry and one reason that dollar is down is the pound.
NEUT14|You know, I just want to give you a shout out for your great call the last time you were in charting futures in August.
NEUT15|That actually wasn't the last time, but you've had two great calls in the British pound saying to buy it for $1.25 a dollar 27.
NEUT16|So it's worked.
BULL17|Yeah, I right now I think that we're going to probably see the pound come back down.
NEUT18|Maybe 1:25 we talked about it, I think just a bit of a cooling off.
NEUT19|After all this news.
NEUT20|Yeah, that's what the chart looks like, but overall longer term it looks like that pound could be bullish.
NEUT21|And you also think coffee could be bullish.
NEUT22|Let's get to commodities now of a dollar.
NEUT23|Yeah, coffee talk.
NEUT24|Yeah, so let's have a little coffee talk.
NEUT25|I like that so you're bullish on this chart of coffee.
BEAR26|13 year lows.
NEUT27|Talk to us about why right?
NEUT28|Well, this is what's brewing here in coffee.
NEUT29|These yellow boxes are areas where there are some demark exhaustion signals happening on the top.
NEUT30|One is the price of coffee and there is a combo, Anna sequential.
NEUT31|On a daily and weekly now, I think it's really important that when you have both getting him together In Sync adds to the conviction.
NEUT32|Now on the bottom, this shows the bearishness of the commitment of traders and you also have a weekly Demark sequential, an combo exhaustion signals.
BEAR33|So people are very very bearish and I think the price of it is trying to hold down here.
NEUT34|OK, so you have a target of 110.
NEUT35|Even 130, let's talk about how you can play that via options, right?
NEUT36|We're always trying to educate our viewers that you can buy options on future.
NEUT37|So here we have your coffee futures option straight.
NEUT38|Well, I think the $100 or $100 strike is a very important place.
NEUT39|I think the shorts will have to start covering if we get above that level there.
NEUT40|So I like that way.
NEUT41|Yeah, so I like the December in February 100 calls it near term.
NEUT42|If that starts going in the next week or two, I think you can see this around 1:05 maybe 106.
BEAR43|And if the February, this really starts to move, it's down 30% for the year.
NEUT44|And why not?
NEUT45|"Let's see it go."""
