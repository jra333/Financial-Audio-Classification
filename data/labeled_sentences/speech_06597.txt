NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|Today will be looking at Euro GBP on the daily chart so zooming in we can see that euro GBP is confronting the firm support foundation of Zero Point 8670 to zero point, 8690 after deteriorating below the McLeod and the simple moving averages more than a month ago, the bearish mocha lines are feeding negative price action while the falling 50 and 100 days amazar nurturing the descent.
BULL2|More over the short term oscillators are demonstrating persisting downwards momentum.
BEAR3|To the downside, immediate stern support arises at the zero point 8670 to Zero Point 8690 base should the near 2 month decline from Zero Point 9210 managed to extend below the severe border, the price may sink to challenge another formidable limiting zone from Zero Point 8620 until Zero Point 8595 and the less traders need to realize that profound negative moves would be required to overcome these boundaries.
BEAR4|If the pair struggles to extend losses below the base and buying interest picks up the price, may encounter initial resistance at the zoo 2746 level.
NEUT5|That being, the 61.8% fewer natural placement of the upper leg from Zero Point 8281 until Zero point 9498 overstepping the red tickets in line that pair could hit the zero point 88 hurdle before meeting the blue Quinjets in line, and the zero point 8839 high.
NEUT6|If the client persists, the Bulls may then target the 50% fib of zero point 8890.
BULL7|Summarizing, in order to cement euro GBP's bearish demeanor, the price would be required to clearly breach the durable zero point 8670 to zero point 8690 obstacle.
BULL8|However, a shift back above the zero point 88 mark could feel more buying interest.
NEUT9|That's it from me.
BULL10|"Have a great trading day."""
