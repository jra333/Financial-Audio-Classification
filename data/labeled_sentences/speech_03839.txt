NEUT0|"""When when you when I hear you saying this thing, what really comes to my mind is what Warren Buffett probably most famous sayings right is you want to be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy."
NEUT1|Above it is talking really in the context of either buying whole companies like Berkshire Hathaway does, or in the context of stocks you want to act counter cyclically.
NEUT2|So I guess what's interesting is that you're saying that you or see you see as both a broker and an owner of commercial real estate.
NEUT3|That same exact type of behavior in the real estate market that we see in the stock market.
NEUT4|Oh yeah, I think without question.
NEUT5|I mean, you know.
NEUT6|Good realist, I mean at a high level good real estate is sold by, you know a call for offers you know which is kind of a pretty interesting concept as opposed to a stock resistance, a free for all and you know you want to try and buy it at the market but.
NEUT7|You know, to really get the you know kind of what we do.
NEUT8|That's maybe different than than what a lot of folks.
NEUT9|Might think of commercial real estate brokerages to do is we have a real market orientation so we don't chase after large institutional real estate as an investment.
NEUT10|What we do is the stuff that the every man could do, and so we work in what I like to call the bottom 80% of the market and we look for value opportunity.
NEUT11|And there's a lot of that out there.
NEUT12|But you've gotta really, you know, pay attention to what's going on in the overall economy and so, like you know, the implication might be.
BEAR13|For example, the China market melts off like it did last week.
NEUT14|And so then that causes some person in Colorado Springs to get scared and decide to sell a building and maybe at a discount.
NEUT15|We come along.
NEUT16|And we're not so afraid of what's going on in China, 'cause we understand what's going on.
NEUT17|And we said we will buy that property because it looks like a real.
BULL18|It's going to be able to buy it below.
NEUT19|You know, prevailing markets and create some value for ourselves.
NEUT20|Anne and we work in, you know again what I call the bottom 80% of the market, which is where the typical maybe investor is is that you know.
NEUT21|I mean, the top 20% is the large institutions and you know that's a whole different conversation.
NEUT22|"So we're kind of like blue collar, lunch, pail, commercial real estate brokers that quote into local markets and find you know, we figure to be really good real estate investments."""
