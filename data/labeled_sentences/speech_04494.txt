BULL0|"""If you look at the results and delivery, the growth continues unabated."
BULL1|We've got gross bookings growth of 128% year on year.
BULL2|Our revenue growth was over 200% in a delivery segment an losses are coming down.
NEUT3|We're investing, but actually in 15 countries now we're profitable generating $100 million in eBay.
NEUT4|DOB on 2 1/2 billion of bookings.
NEUT5|So the question is to like everyone agrees delivery can be big, but can it be profitable?
NEUT6|The answer there is yes.
NEUT7|On the mobility side, ask things.
NEUT8|Open up our business comes back and mobility.
BULL9|We proven profitability for some purchase on.
BEAR10|As Doctor Shahe of Uber on squawk earlier this morning, stocks go up and down about 1%, obviously as the quarter was, I guess a gym, a little mixed.
NEUT11|Although Morgan Stanley this morning reiterates topic, target is 70.
NEUT12|Well, it's hard to resist because you've got that dynamic where if the market economy stays closed, they do great and delivery.
NEUT13|If the economy stays open, they'll keep delivery and then obviously the new mobility was there.
BULL14|Excellent conference call.
NEUT15|They're talking about owning the next hour, David, that's a new one there saying maybe the next hours pharmacy.
NEUT16|Obviously, they liked this drizzly acquisition very much to do alcohol, but the one thing David that's missing here is they're not making a lot of money.
NEUT17|No, they're not.
BEAR18|In fact, they're losing a lot.
NEUT19|I feared you would bring that up.
NEUT20|I know you would just go right there, you know.
NEUT21|I mean, we keep talking about the ride businesses though.
BEAR22|It's an afterthought were bookings were down 47% year over year.
BULL23|Versus 50% in the third quarter, so I guess sequentially it's improved a bit and we all know while being in it, but it is.
NEUT24|Is this a reopening trade or not?
NEUT25|I mean well, yeah, I think it is, but this is it's very glaring to me that delivery is is the emphasis, but if you don't ultimately have autonomous driving if you don't get that down, then I think you have a business that's just a good business, but it's not.
NEUT26|It's a taxi business and a delivery business.
NEUT27|That's not Amazon.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
