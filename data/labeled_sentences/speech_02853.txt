BEAR0|"""So basically anybody who holds this bond throughout its full life is guaranteed to lose money, and they're guaranteed to lose money over a period of 30 years."
BEAR1|Now, what this is telling us really is that anybody who thinks that this is a good investment is factoring in an extremely bleak economic outlook.
NEUT2|You're talking about no growth, no inflation for the next three decades, right?
NEUT3|That's you know, that's.
BEAR4|But that's a pretty a pretty poor outlook.
NEUT5|The market currently pricing in.
NEUT6|I also wonder how many people are just buying these to flip them because Tommy, the price, appreciation and bonds this year has been incredible.
NEUT7|You could've made a ton of money just owning bonds and flipping them, maybe flipping him back to the central bank.
NEUT8|So is the European Central Bank in part to blame for this?
NEUT9|Because they're doing so much bond buying and they told us last week in September they're going to announce even more.
NEUT10|Absolutely.
NEUT11|The European Central Bank is really at the heart of this trade at the moment.
BEAR12|They're not buying bonds at the moment, they've they've wound down their QE program because inflation in the eurozone is so persistently low, because growth stubbornly refuses to pick up.
NEUT13|They basically basically signaled that a new package of easing is on the way in September, and investors really are assuming that means more QE.
NEUT14|More bond buying by a central bank.
BEAR15|So you're absolutely right, if you buy this bond today, yes, it might look like a poor investment if you hold it on.
NEUT16|Hold onto it for 30 years, but if you can you can sell it onto the European Central Bank for a higher price, right?
NEUT17|Possibly as soon as next month, then that doesn't look so bad after all.
BULL18|And bear in mind these bonds have returned something like 30% in price terms already this year.
NEUT19|Yeah, they're like it's the hottest market in the world.
NEUT20|One of the hottest we've seen in the past decade.
NEUT21|So another way.
NEUT22|Obviously, if you're looking for growth and we know Germany is really slowing, it sounds like its exposure to China.
NEUT23|That's a big reason there is fiscal stimulus.
NEUT24|Why are we not hearing more from Europe?
NEUT25|Whether it's Germany or other countries?
NEUT26|About fiscal stimulus.
NEUT27|I mean, it makes sense, doesn't it?
NEUT28|If you can get paid by investors to borrow, surely you should be borrowing more.
BEAR29|Now we are hearing early rumblings from inside Germany that they're kind of their refusal to countenance running, running any sort of budget deficit may be beginning to shift.
NEUT30|I mean, it's early days, yet it's it's.
NEUT31|It's really, it's.
NEUT32|It's something that's hardwired into German politics that are you run, you run a budget surplus you you govern in a fiscally responsible way that may now have to start to change.
BEAR33|'cause, as you say, the German economy is really suffering.
NEUT34|We're talking about an economy that is geared to World Trade.
NEUT35|The where exports are an extremely important part of the economy, and you know when there's a global trade war going on.
NEUT36|"An economy like that is going to be first in the firing line."""
