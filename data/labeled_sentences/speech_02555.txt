NEUT0|"""Tim, what kind of a landmark moment is this?"
NEUT1|I can't help but notice that the market cap of Tesla right now is about where apples was when President Trump was elected.
BULL2|Yeah, and Elon has talked about how he thinks Tesla Sunday might be equal in value to Apple, but for now and in the Today, we've really seen the benefit in the last few months.
BULL3|And the exuberance in the marketplace on the anticipation that would get in the S&P 500, we saw the stock really sore and Tesla was able to go to market and raise capital with issuing just a few.
NEUT4|And you know, a lot of shares so really cheaply for them to raise a lot of money, which gives them a treasure chest toward chest to pay for all of that growth that they're anticipating in the future.
NEUT5|Which investors are in turn super excited about?
NEUT6|Is it all upside Tim?
NEUT7|For Tesla here I mean, in one sense, they're becoming more of an establishment company, but at the same time we've seen Apple is sort of maintain that underdog culture and mindset, despite the fact that it's the biggest dog out there.
NEUT8|Any risks here that analysts are talking about?
NEUT9|Well, you know you bring us something interesting here.
NEUT10|I mean, Elon Musk has built this company bucking tradition.
NEUT11|He doesn't do what people say he should do, right?
NEUT12|So the idea that he's somehow going to change that Tesla is somehow going to become a stodgy companies probably very unrealistic at this point.
BULL13|In fact, it probably emboldened him going forward.
NEUT14|The challenge maybe?
NEUT15|Are there even more attention?
BEAR16|Will be on Tesla that it'll be even harder for the company to make mistakes or to miss goals in the future.
NEUT17|And that's something that Tesla has struggled with in the past, but it was always kind of shrugged off in part because, well, it was a startup.
NEUT18|It was trying something that was unheard of impossible.
NEUT19|But now the largest automaker in the world, by market value, part of the S&P 500 to be here's a company that he's got a huge target on it, tell me.
NEUT20|You say don't expect Elon Musk to change.
NEUT21|I'm not sure he hasn't already changed a bit.
NEUT22|I mean, it seems like maybe since the latest baby or something, he hasn't been quite as volatile on Twitter.
NEUT23|At least he's not breaking as many rules that are raising regulatory issues.
NEUT24|You think that's going to happen again?
NEUT25|Or are we entering a new kind of calmer, gentler Elon Musk era?
NEUT26|Well, I think if you look at the company overtime, what we've seen is some ups and downs, and that's usually around when they're trying to take on something really hard for the first time we saw him to be most volatile during the Model 3 ramp up production issues in 2018, when.
NEUT27|Really, the company was on the line.
BEAR28|It's it's been ability to go forward was really challenged it similarly when they the the company struggled in late 2008 and then 2000 early 2013.
BEAR29|Now these were periods of high stress for Elon and he suffered personally during those periods and the company suffered.
NEUT30|With what was different in 2018.
NEUT31|Was that just so much attention in the steaks were just so much higher that people kind of noticed in the world that you know sometimes he does some erratic things, yeah?
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
