NEUT0|"""Before I give you any specific advice here, I want to make a few more changes to the Camera covered index."
NEUT1|Typically we're adding VM Ware, Sanjay Poonen really helping us on that fastly Woo and Newmont Mining will take the place is 300 performers.
NEUT2|Baxter International, Glaxo Smith, Kline and Kellogg.
NEUT3|While these three first back to the medical supplies play at last time around, we removed back in dates of the index arguing that we didn't need both.
NEUT4|It Baxter there in the same business, but now that the pandemic truly here to stay for the next few months, I don't pass her either.
NEUT5|They simply have too much exposure to surgeries that will be delayed.
NEUT6|As hospitals all over the country focus on treating covid patients, there are plenty of healthcare stocks that work here.
NEUT7|Baxter is not one of them.
BEAR8|Speaking of health care, we could have dumped Glaxo Smith Kline.
NEUT9|I know high quality drug company traffic yield.
NEUT10|I think it would be safer than other big Pharma office, but it's clearly not enticing.
NEUT11|Many investors here, which is surprising me.
NEUT12|Glasses working on a covid vaccine with Sanofi, but Sanofi's in the index.
NEUT13|We don't need both.
NEUT14|3rd, there's Kellogg.
BEAR15|We have eight packaged food companies in this index, and half of them are negative territory.
BEAR16|We gotta cut one General Mills and James Smoker.
NEUT17|Both have pet food kickers, Mongolian, Camel, super better snacking, ConAgra Zone, Fire wow, kellum.
BEAR18|They really have not kept up.
BEAR19|They are disappointing alright.
NEUT20|What about the three new additions?
NEUT21|VM Ware is obvious.
NEUT22|This is one of the Cloud Kings.
BULL23|Cloud stocks have been some of the most consistent winners in the covid economy.
NEUT24|Remember, VM Ware virtualization software is what makes the clouds possible by letting you run multiple virtual machines on a single server.
NEUT25|Even better, VM Ware is the rare cloud stock that's actually cheap on earnings basis.
NEUT26|Bestival VM Ware is a subsidiary of Dell.
NEUT27|Last week Dell floated the idea of spinning it off modular PayPal before responded by eBay member that opportunity OK, the second new addition these guys.
NEUT28|Fastly, I mean it's a next generation content delivery network.
NEUT29|I don't even feel like calling in CDN.
NEUT30|It's so much better than that it, but it means that they help ensure everything works smoothly over the web.
NEUT31|I wish I'd included new original index 'cause it's becoming the hottest stocks in the market.
NEUT32|But to be fair, I didn't realize how good the story really was into it.
BULL33|Brought the CEO on a month ago, Wowza since then the stock surged 81% even for big pullback today.
NEUT34|I think it may need to cool down some more.
NEUT35|Maybe that was the cool down this afternoon, but it's too important to be left out of the crane recovered index.
NEUT36|They power Shopify the New York Times stripe among some other great customers.
NEUT37|Really good reading.
NEUT38|By the way, if you go to see some of the stuff they're up to third with the virus for Sergeant.
NEUT39|Many states going back into partial lockdown, we need some more insurance, economic chaos and the best insurance policy is gold.
NEUT40|Which brings me to Newmont, the minor created by the merger of Goldcorp with the old Newmont.
NEUT41|We just spoke to CEO Tom Palmer two weeks ago.
NEUT42|You had a conservative strategy that should allow Newmont to keep winning whether or not gold prices keep roaring.
