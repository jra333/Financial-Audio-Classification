BULL0|"""Hey Dan Fitzpatrick."
NEUT1|Here stock market mentor.com real quick video here.
NEUT2|I like Facebook.
BEAR3|As a short look, the stock nice move up here fell below the 50 day moving average as it did here.
BULL4|And as it did here, both of these times, the stock recovered and kept going higher here fell down here, ultimately climbed back above the 50 day moving average along with the rest of the market one.
BEAR5|Slightly below it, but you know who look who's counting closed out the 51 day above the 50 day moving average and then it fell back down so the stocks down for one 2-3 days in a row back below the 50.
NEUT6|And so I like this as a short not in a big way.
NEUT7|I'm not shorting the company I'm shorting this pattern and there is a difference.
NEUT8|And so the way that I, the way that I do this, this is my.
NEUT9|This is the way I look at it.
NEUT10|You know, I see a sell off and then an attempted recovery up above there and then a failure boom.
NEUT11|So this sucked in.
NEUT12|All the buyers, people who were looking at Facebook and saying oh this is my opportunity to buy.
NEUT13|So they bought the stock here now as the stocks rolling over they are in the red.
BEAR14|They're not happy they thought that they were getting a great deal but they got on the wrong side of the move.
BEAR15|And now Facebook's coming back down so they're going to go ahead and sell their stock.
NEUT16|They're going to go ahead and sell that and get out of the trade before they lose more.
NEUT17|That's the thesis for why this stock is probably going lower.
NEUT18|However.
NEUT19|You need to keep a protective stop right above this level.
NEUT20|Here, right above this last high, wherever it is right here, you need to keep a protective stop above there and This is why.
BEAR21|Because if the stock takes off an it could very well could if it takes off, you don't want to get caught in this short squeeze your choking off your trade right here you're cutting it for a small loss.
NEUT22|OK, whether or not you'd buy it on the other side, I can tell you bout that.
NEUT23|That's nine steps ahead.
NEUT24|Nobody knows that though they'll tell you that they do.
BEAR25|You're looking at the stock to continue down now if it falls to 250, maybe a little bit lower.
NEUT26|Fine, I'm not looking for a lot out of these short things.
NEUT27|There's a buy side of the market.
NEUT28|You know there has been, you know, for 150 years there's always a buy side, a bias to the market.
NEUT29|So when we take these shorts, we take him for a very short period of time and then we cover.
NEUT30|But I do think this short will work.
NEUT31|I'm just saying you want to make sure you keep it fairly tight by stop on there so that the trade doesn't get away from you if the stock reverses.
NEUT32|So anyway, that's all I got Members.
NEUT33|I got a unique video for you.
NEUT34|I have something I have an idea that will really, really help you.
NEUT35|Ascentia Lee Conquer the biggest goon that you're dealing with in this market will just put it that way.
NEUT36|"And no, it's not me."""
