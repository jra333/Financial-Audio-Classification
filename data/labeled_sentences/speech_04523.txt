NEUT0|"""What are you?"
NEUT1|What are you recommending to your client?
NEUT2|Seems like all of a sudden a world of volatility has now popped in upon us.
NEUT3|Yeah, when we speak to clients at the moment we're talking about getting risk a little bit closer to neutral.
BULL4|So whereas last year it made sense to be positioned relatively aggressively overweight in risk at the moment we think it makes more sense to be closer to neutral and we're just looking at various different ways of doing that, so getting closer to neutral in terms of a size bias within portfolios to not being overweight, mid and small cap stocks and likewise getting close to neutral from a style perspective, so not being overweight growth as much as would have been sensible over the last few years.
NEUT5|OK Paul, you know what I love?
NEUT6|I love your latest note because it's like, you know, we think of the children, right?
NEUT7|Think of the economist.
NEUT8|How do you guys do your job?
NEUT9|How do you model anything about US growth or global growth or whatever with all these variables and unknowns that are floating around?
NEUT10|I mean big ones.
NEUT11|Well, I mean the the bottom line is economist shouldn't make forecasts, at least not point forecasts.
NEUT12|What we've got to look at here are the trends hold.
NEUT13|That's like, you know, it's not the job.
NEUT14|This is.
NEUT15|This is a fallacy created by CNBC.
NEUT16|My job is to predict trends and direction.
NEUT17|Whether growth is 3.2 or 3.1.
NEUT18|You know who cares?
NEUT19|It's going to be revised anyway.
NEUT20|We gotta get the broad story right.
NEUT21|And the broad story this year.
NEUT22|You know what economists have been right all year.
NEUT23|This shouldn't be a surprise to anybody.
BULL24|We've got a stable, slightly above trend growth number.
BULL25|For the global economy this year, the numbers have come in exactly as predicted.
NEUT26|We're going to slow down a bit next year, but nothing too serious.
NEUT27|The economics is fine.
NEUT28|The problem is politicians keep interfering.
NEUT29|I'm going to add fallacy creator to my Twitter bio when this segment is over.
NEUT30|Mike Bell, you heard that you have to rely on growth estimates though, right?
NEUT31|Do you not?
NEUT32|I mean, how do you when you look around the world?
NEUT33|Where do I invest our money where our clients money?
NEUT34|Where should we go?
NEUT35|You have to be able to make some assumptions about where growth will be.
BULL36|Yeah, I think growth at the moment for this.
BULL37|The rest of this year and actually probably for most of next year still should hold up OK, but I think the issue is it's about starting to get a bit more balanced in portfolios because I think the risks for the economy in the US are starting to rise once you look beyond the end of 2019.
NEUT38|So as monetary policy continues to tighten in the US and you've got this potential for a fiscal fade unless something changes thereby by the time we look ahead to 2020, I think it's just about.
NEUT39|Adding some resilience to portfolios, so looking at fixed income for example, and the potential for Treasurys acting as a bit of a hedge to the equity exposure, but also looking at absolute return vehicles as well.
NEUT40|OK, Paul, here's the I guess that that $1 trillion question about our Federal Reserve, which is, we know our president has been applying pressure indirectly to the maybe even directly to the Federal Reserve.
BEAR41|Do you think that Jay Powell and Company are going to waver?
NEUT42|Do you think that this pressure will work and they will become a little less hawkish with regard to interest rates?
NEUT43|Will they bend?
NEUT44|No, nor should they.
NEUT45|I mean, if we look at where real Fed funds are today, they are pretty much where they were in 2016.
BEAR46|When then candidate Trump was complaining that the Fed funds were far too low.
BULL47|the US economy is at full employment.
BULL48|It's had a deficit financed tax cut.
NEUT49|You do not need zero real rates in this environment.
BULL50|"You need positive real rates and the Federal Reserve will take us there."""
