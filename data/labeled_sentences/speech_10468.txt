NEUT0|"""Which brings me to the bookcase on January 3rd, Bank of America kick things off a pretty L Brands to buy and raising the price target from 21 to 25 their argument, they say bath and body works is the best in class asset and they believe management has a lot of different opportunities to unlock value."
NEUT1|I totally agree with that in particular.
NEUT2|Hoping for a bath and body works spinoff.
NEUT3|I agree with that.
BULL4|As for Victoria's Secret, that could be a very positive.
NEUT5|Be positive channels to have.
BEAR6|It gets so bad that management has to completely rethink the brand.
NEUT7|Next, on January 10, Deutsche Bank.
BULL8|They took our brains from hold to buy even as they cut their earnest message in the wake of a not so high Holidays.
NEUT9|Sales work.
BEAR10|Now this was one of those outright in is so bad that it's good call as they see it.
NEUT11|The week was also make a breakup more likely.
NEUT12|You also pointed out that the distance agreement with that activist firm I mentioned, Barrington expires next month, so they can start pushing for a split.
NEUT13|I think that that's very important to the site guys of the analysts.
BULL14|This past Tuesday, Keybanc upgraded L Brands from equal weight to overweight.
BULL15|Their argument may sound familiar quote, we believe that the stark differential in performance between Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body works and lack of any discernible turn around at Victoria's Secret, make some value, creating transaction.
NEUT16|More likely.
NEUT17|End Quote finally, and this was the one that I just said.
NEUT18|Alright, alright, alright, come on, let's do a business.
BULL19|Barclays came out with a coveted double upgrade yesterday.
NEUT20|That's when you get to sell directly to buy don't go to hold do not pass go and they're making the same case as everybody else.
NEUT21|I mean here's how we they put it and I'm going to quote.
BULL22|We believe change is afoot.
NEUT23|While we cannot be certain what form change will take, what we can say is the status quo is not an option in quote and look, I get where they're coming from.
NEUT24|L Brands appears to be cheap.
NEUT25|Trading at 9 times earnings, they don't need to get much right for the stock filter or higher Anna spinoff to unlock the value of bath and body works would be a home run.
NEUT26|I do think someone is in something is in the works.
NEUT27|Or you wouldn't get such a flurry of upgrades.
NEUT28|It just doesn't happen.
NEUT29|But here's the problem.
BEAR30|Turnarounds take time and you can lose a fortune while you're waiting for an intractable management to do the right thing.
BEAR31|Even then, I don't think it'll happen overnight, and I wouldn't be surprised if there's another dividend cut because the pain from Victoria's Secret is so severe.
BEAR32|If it gets any worse, I think the business will be losing L Brands money.
NEUT33|Of course, if you're going to bet on a turn around, you have to get in early before there's any significant evidence that things are getting better.
BEAR34|But considering the recent track record albums at this point, after all these upgrades, I'm a tad wary.
NEUT35|I'm not jumping on the Bush bandwagon.
