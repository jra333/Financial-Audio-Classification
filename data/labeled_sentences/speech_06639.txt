NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Friday, July 21st among graduate U.
NEUT2|Current salaries are exempted from today.
NEUT3|Will be looking at the dollar versus Swiss franc on the daily chart.
BEAR4|So USD CHF recorded a 14 1/2 month low of point 9492 during yesterday's trading.
BEAR5|The pair is currently slightly down on the day while it reveals your yesterday's low earlier in the session.
BEAR6|The bias is clearly tilted to the downside.
NEUT7|They make these negative as well as below.
BEAR8|The red signal line, while RSI is willing to bearish territory at 33 and keeps getting lower.
BEAR9|Also notice that RSI is close to oversold levels.
BEAR10|If the price reverses course and moves higher, resistance could be made around .96.
BEAR11|A potential psychological level further up the area around Point 9650 was a rather congested one in there is in past and my doctors a barrier to the outside as well.
BULL12|On the downside point 9492 to 14 1/2 month low seems to be providing immediate support.
BULL13|Should the price cross below additional support could come around the point 94 handle.
BEAR14|Another potential psychological mark regarding the medium term price action taking place below both the 50 and 200 day moving averages supports their negative medium term signal given by the bearish cross that was recorded in late May when the 50 day moving average moved below the 200 day one.
BEAR15|Overall, the pair is bearish in the short and medium term.
NEUT16|That's it for today.
BULL17|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
