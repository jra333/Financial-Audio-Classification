BEAR0|"""The front page of the Wall Street Journal Territory hedge fund star dims investors both."
NEUT1|This is story in today's Wall Street Journal outlining the hard times for a.
BEAR2|Along time, guest of Squawk Box actually David Einhorn Green, Light Capital, the paper reporting greenlights assets have shrunk to about $5.5 billion in assets from reported 12 billion back in 2014.
BEAR3|They spoke to more than a dozen former investors and employees and other sources who they say are threatening to exit if the funds results don't rebound.
BEAR4|People familiar with the fund attribute Einhorn's troubles to sticking to value stocks over high growth stocks and keeping clients at a distance.
NEUT5|One of us to raise concerns about his divorce and his sleeping habits.
NEUT6|Einhorn.
NEUT7|Told investors earlier this year that he'd been shorting stocks like Amazon and Tina Health and Netflix.
NEUT8|Obviously all of them went up, we should say.
NEUT9|The story says he has a sleeping disorder which keeps him, which hasn't wake up at 3:00 o'clock in the morning.
NEUT10|Apps in the middle of the afternoon.
NEUT11|You can't stay awake for meetings in the afternoon, but what's so remarkable about it?
BEAR12|I mean, they have people on the record saying my patience is wearing thin.
NEUT13|This is unbelievable.
NEUT14|Others who say all sorts of things.
NEUT15|The 5.5 billion by the way.
NEUT16|And by the way, we should say Gregory Zuckerman wrote this piece.
NEUT17|We've had him on the show many times.
NEUT18|Really, it sounds like there's maybe only about $3.5 billion outside money of outside money because it's about a billion of his own money.
NEUT19|Another billion from the reinsurance right fund, which he controls.
NEUT20|So wait a minute he.
NEUT21|Wakes up at 3:00 in the morning at work and naps in the afternoon.
NEUT22|You know somebody like that.
NEUT23|I'm not saying that are really.
NEUT24|What does it say that that happens to a person who happens to do that?
NEUT25|I don't know their performance and I'm gonna say that.
NEUT26|OK, here's the thing Andrew.
NEUT27|I remember when he was hot and this was like five years ago and I remember reading some of the stuff into 58% of them.
NEUT28|But some of the stuff that he was doing.
NEUT29|He was like love gold at like 1800 after he loved Sun Edison.
NEUT30|I mean which and you know.
NEUT31|I don't.
NEUT32|I don't try to, you know.
NEUT33|I don't manage money.
NEUT34|I mean I used.
NEUT35|I was a broker for awhile, but they some of these trades look really stupid to me back then, so I don't.
NEUT36|I don't know.
BEAR37|So probably the fun dropped 7.7% in June is down 18.7% for the year.
NEUT38|Of course S&P 500.
NEUT39|We've got 2%.
NEUT40|We know where that is relative to what's going.
NEUT41|You know what past performances but never any guarantees this guy Peter Weiss is a Boston investor says he's stubborn, will never admit he's made a mistake, just makes me crazy.
NEUT42|That exactly the reason why you should invest with him then then I'm Horn says in a statement.
BEAR43|When we recognize the mistake, we exit position and own up to our quarter in our quarterly.
NEUT44|I mean, it's a lot of back and forth, and people know it may be rare where you get people who go on the record.
NEUT45|There were articles written about Ackman and then he came back.
BEAR46|Who knows, maybe this is the bottom for this guy.
NEUT47|This one was fascinating.
NEUT48|This is a another investor says if someone usually goes through divorce, I usually get out.
BEAR49|I made an exception with David, but I made a mistake.
NEUT50|He has to be distracted.
BEAR51|I'm convinced that's 30 to 40% of why the stock is down, not the stock, but the performance is down.
NEUT52|But let's say, by the way we should say, David Einhorn says that he is completely, utterly focused.
