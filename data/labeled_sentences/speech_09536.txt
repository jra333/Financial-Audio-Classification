NEUT0|"""We want to look at CVS."
NEUT1|You have a young 10 year old in the other room who's dying.
NEUT2|For some reason in love with CVS, go ahead.
NEUT3|Ball CVS.
NEUT4|Look at CVS.
NEUT5|It was $112.00 back in 2015.
NEUT6|Now it's $68 a share almost half, so it's a $90 billion company.
NEUT7|Wow PE is only 11 guys so check mark their profit margin.
NEUT8|Not so good guys.
NEUT9|So #3 Paul is the revenue growth over the past five years revenue growth last five years one 53178 one 85195 to 56.
NEUT10|Definite check mark.
NEUT11|Phone number for profit growth for CVS.
NEUT12|5.25 point 36.6 random loss 6.6 So check Mark there how about Pillar #5 number of shares outstanding palmour 1.1 to 1.3 they probably issued shares in order to buy.
NEUT13|Aetna is my guess that's probably what they did.
NEUT14|OK, how about Pillar #6 current assets greater than current liabilities ball?
BEAR15|I imagine this is not gonna be good 59 billion in current assets.
NEUT16|62 billion in current liabilities.
NEUT17|You know it's a retail store that's low margin.
NEUT18|They're going to have.
NEUT19|They're not going to be able to cover that very easy.
BULL20|Pillar #7 free cash flow growth 6.27 point 96.16 point 810.4 so the check mark on growth.
NEUT21|What's the average?
NEUT22|Uncle Seth 7 1/2 hours so they're selling for about 12 times, not even 12 times free cash flow.
NEUT23|Not bad at this sheet that I use to determine what I want to pay for a stock.
NEUT24|It goes based on revenue growth.
NEUT25|The revenue growth here is big as you remember because of the Aetna acquisition, so we don't know now.
NEUT26|The other thing though is there were years of free cash flow, which into acquisition wasn't accounted for.
NEUT27|Actually might not be a bad play.
NEUT28|We have Walgreens.
NEUT29|We might want to look at CVS.
NEUT30|So the big thing here is, how is Aetna going to help them generate more cash flow?
NEUT31|Bring people more in the store?
NEUT32|I'm sure a big part of it has to do with bringing people historic when they're there.
NEUT33|They're buying pop.
NEUT34|They're buying chips, they're buying a small gift or buying candy, etc.
NEUT35|If they're getting their film developed.
NEUT36|So either way this isn't bad guys.
NEUT37|the PE is low and they can definitely easy afford the dividend being the market by over 1%, so I'm not opposed to this one.
NEUT38|This is something to do more research on and and get some more information on.
BULL39|"This is good."""
