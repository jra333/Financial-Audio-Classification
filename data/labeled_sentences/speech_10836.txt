NEUT0|"""What's up, you guys."
NEUT1|Welcome to the iconic.
NEUT2|So it's your host Inam Khan.
NEUT3|If you're new to this channel, we talked all things stuck and just improving your personal financial situation.
NEUT4|If you're into that stuff, go ahead and like and subscribe to this channel.
NEUT5|We don't always talk about cryptocurrency, but today I just could not resist.
NEUT6|Let's talk about Bitcoin.
BULL7|So Bitcoin broke his previous record of 2017 earlier this month.
BULL8|Just this month, on December 1st by hitting $19,920.
NEUT9|Well, folks last night, not only did it break $20,000.
NEUT10|It did not stop at 21,000 or 22,000 or even 23,000.
NEUT11|As of making this video, it's currently sitting at $23,800 and keep in mind, just earlier this year during when the pandemic was at its peak, Bitcoin was at $4800.
NEUT12|This is like a 500% increase, so that brings up the question, why is Bitcoin going up so high?
NEUT13|So randomly?
NEUT14|I mean, keep in mind if you guys are around in 2017, there was a lot of hype around Bitcoin, whereas this time around.
NEUT15|I feel like no one's even talking about it that much and boom, it just broke the previous record of 20,000.
NEUT16|So what's going on?
NEUT17|So there's two main reasons I found so.
NEUT18|One is that institutional investors are flying to Bitcoin.
NEUT19|This was definitely not the case in 2017.
BEAR20|A lot of institutional investors kind of blew it off site.
NEUT21|It's all fake and bootleg, whereas this time around a lot of people are investing into it.
NEUT22|A lot of the big institutions are investing into it.
BEAR23|Another big reason I found is that because of all of the money that's being printed by the US Fed, people are worried that there's going to be increased inflation in the coming years.
NEUT24|And because of that they are flying off to Bitcoin to hedge against inflation.
NEUT25|And finally there is another reason where there's a limited amount of Bitcoin, and I believe the last Bitcoin is going to be mined soon.
NEUT26|I know that's coming up as well.
NEUT27|I don't know the exact date, but I know that is another reason why the prices are skyrocketing.
NEUT28|But that being said, let's talk about this new $400,000 price prediction of Bitcoin so Scott Minard from Guggenheim Global.
NEUT29|I don't even know if I said that right.
NEUT30|He was on Bloomberg last night or this morning I believe and he basically said that his firm believes.
NEUT31|That Bitcoin will hit a price of $400,000 per coin.
NEUT32|They even put their money where their mouth is by saying that their fund, which currently sits at around $5.3 billion.
NEUT33|They will invest up to 10% of it into cryptocurrencies.
NEUT34|They said there's just last month now.
NEUT35|Why do they believe it's going to hit $400,000?
NEUT36|Well, first of all, it's a scarcity that I mentioned earlier.
NEUT37|As I mentioned, there's only a limited number of Bitcoin available.
NEUT38|It's not like money where you can print more of it.
NEUT39|There's only a limited number available, and once that's all mine did, the price of Bitcoin will go up most like the other reason for why they're saying it's going to be around $400,000 is because.
NEUT40|Is there comparing it primarily to gold goldran in terms of its value and in terms of its percentage to total GDP?
NEUT41|They're kind of super imposing that on to Bitcoin, and that's where they're coming up with their $400,000 price prediction.
NEUT42|Now guys, keep in mind I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just some random guy on YouTube.
NEUT43|This is for entertainment purposes only.
NEUT44|I'm not telling you guys to go out, spend all their money on Bitcoin, but I want to hear from you guys.
NEUT45|What do you guys think about this?
NEUT46|Are you guys investing in Bitcoin or not?
NEUT47|And where do you guys think it's going to land by the end of this year?
