NEUT0|"""If you look at the list Stephanie of the new highs today, besides Apple, it's you know a lot of the usual suspects."
NEUT1|Electronic Arts, Chipotle, Best Buy.
NEUT2|Kimberly Clark, Kansas City.
NEUT3|I mean, these are stocks that hit new highs almost everyday.
NEUT4|So is that what you're doing?
NEUT5|Are you adding to to winners?
NEUT6|Well, no, I'm actually trimming an.
NEUT7|I'm sorry that I sold Facebook, but I think it was the right thing to do.
BULL8|Taking a 47% gain, I trimmed a little bit of Amazon.
NEUT9|I still am involved.
NEUT10|The problem is, is that some of these companies that are going vertical, especially the fangs plus Microsoft, they're huge.
NEUT11|They're huge percentages in my benchmark in the S&P 500.
NEUT12|So you have to own a lot of it if you believe that you know if you think that they're still going to go up, you don't want to caught right?
NEUT13|And I certainly don't want to short these things, not right now, so.
BULL14|Look, I think you guys we've had a good week, the economy, the economic data in the USA and in Europe in the eurozone has actually been pretty good.
BULL15|I mean, we've had expansion numbers in the PM eyes, the isma's in the United States, new orders, which is a leading indicator, is the highest level since November 2018 in the eurozone.
BULL16|Well, if you see this retail sales, Spain and Italy up double digits in factory orders in Germany of 27%, these are real numbers.
BULL17|A stimulus is certainly in the fiscal and monetary stimulus around the world is kicking in.
BEAR18|It's encouraging, but that said you can't have 1.2 A 2,000,000 weekly initial jobless claims each week even though it was a better number.
BULL19|And that's why we're going to get more stimulus.
NEUT20|So I think you have to just hold on 'cause because the liquidity is here to stay and it's not going away.
BULL21|"And that's what's fueling the market higher."""
