BULL0|"""NVIDIA reporting record sales."
BULL1|Amid the pandemic, driven by strong demand for its online gaming and data center chips, it's outlook also better than expected.
BEAR2|But the stock came under pressure after a more than 170% run over the past year.
BULL3|Semiconductor stocks, Meanwhile, have been a big part of the market rally, outperforming the broader market, joining us now to talk more about what's working, Vicaria senior semiconductor analyst at Bank of America Securities, and Vivek this does not.
BEAR4|From what I can tell, dampen your enthusiasm for the sector or for NVIDIA.
BULL5|In fact, you are raising your price target.
NEUT6|Yes, Sir, good morning too.
BULL7|Thanks for having me so NVIDIA is our top sector pick in the sector.
NEUT8|I think it's one of the most unique companies in semiconductors.
NEUT9|You know, maybe perhaps in technology, and we think it's on its way to become the first half a trillion market cap or even higher company in semiconductors.
BEAR10|And you know, we're going to go through these variations and noise where the stock runs up a lot.
BULL11|Into earnings, but the key is they reported very solid results.
BULL12|30% organic sales growth including 80% in their data center business.
NEUT13|And think about that.
BULL14|80% that compares to cloud spending that is only growing 15% this year, so they're clearly executing extremely well.
BULL15|They're gaining market share and their position, or where technology is going.
NEUT16|And one other very important point I want to mention is that this is not just a company that is growing.
BULL17|Extremely well, it's executing extremely well.
NEUT18|You know we focus just on top line growth, but invidious turning $0.40 out of every dollar in sales into free cash flow, which I think is over twice or what we see from a lot of other software and Internet companies, so it's not just growing extremely well.
BULL19|It's an extremely profitable company.
NEUT20|So you go to 600.
NEUT21|You were at 5:20.
NEUT22|For that's right, and you know what I've seen with NVIDIA and you know we have followed it for almost a decade now is it's?
NEUT23|It's less about the price, target percent, and I think it's more about the megatrends.
NEUT24|You know what is important in technology and how the company is exposed to it.
NEUT25|So when I look at some of the largest and fastest growing markets in technology, artificial intelligence, gaming, healthcare, robotics, automation, autonomous cars, you need.
NEUT26|A very strong architecture software developer portfolio to go after those megatrends in a very consistent manner, and I think that is what NVIDIA has managed to achieve and This is why the company over the last few years has gone from under a 5 billion market cap to a 300 billion market CAP II in very important thing over the companies that it's not just selling chips, it's actually selling complete systems for $200,000.
NEUT27|So we think of it as a chip company, but it's actually providing.
BEAR28|Integrated systems and that really reduces the time to market for a lot of its customers.
BULL29|So a number of advantages.
BULL30|"And we we think it's in still in very early stages of its growth."""
