NEUT0|"""In the real estate world, as more people are buying and selling homes with the cryptocurrency, our Diana Olick is taking a closer look."
NEUT1|This Manhattan Beach CA home recently sold for Bitcoin, one of a growing number of mostly high end properties now being listed and purchased in cryptocurrency.
NEUT2|I would say we're just at the beginning.
NEUT3|We met real estate agent Dan Crypto expert Tony Giordano three years ago when he listed this massive Malibu home for sale in Bitcoin.
NEUT4|It ended up selling in dollars, but that was then what's happened since that last is it's become more.
NEUT5|Popular where people are asking more often.
NEUT6|How do I go about buying a home using Bitcoin or cryptocurrency as the form of currency for buying real estate, which is why his company now has a crypto management division designed to help agents and consumers through the process and he shared some advice with us.
NEUT7|First you'll need to find a real estate agent who knows how to work with Bitcoin.
NEUT8|Someone who's already facilitated a transaction.
NEUT9|If you're a buyer or a seller, paid off properties with no mortgage.
NEUT10|Make the transaction much easier.
NEUT11|You'll also need a crypto real estate attorney, someone who specializes in the paperwork and liability aspects.
NEUT12|And finally, you'll need a third party escrow that is a Bitcoin mover who can both transfer and hold the token.
NEUT13|I've been accepting Bitcoin since 2013 when I owned and managed coffee shops up here in upstate New York, which is why Paul Paterakis decided to list his Troy, NY home for both Bitcoin and dollars.
NEUT14|I just put it up in January.
NEUT15|As a Bitcoin listing and then a few days later I did have an offer in U.S. dollars so that was pending, so I did not see.
NEUT16|What Bitcoin could offer?
NEUT17|And that may be the biggest issue for Bitcoin in today's Ultra competitive real estate market.
BULL18|Demand is so high that sellers are likely to get multiple offers in dollars before Bitcoin ever enters the picture.
BULL19|That said, on the Ultra high end, which is less competitive and where international buyers play, listing in Bitcoin will garner more attention and more buzz about the property and could ultimately lead to a faster sale back to you guys.
NEUT20|Yeah Diana, this to me feels like a lot of hype and marketing.
NEUT21|I mean, we talk about Bitcoin as a store value.
BULL22|We've seen it's, you know, humongous rise over the last year and last few months.
NEUT23|If you really think you know Bitcoin is going to the moon and you want to hold, why would someone want to spend money?
NEUT24|Spend that you know, as a transfer of value, so have any homes.
NEUT25|How many homes do you know have actually been sold using Bitcoin?
NEUT26|Have anyone gotten to that point?
NEUT27|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT28|There have been a couple of dozen being sold in California, Giordano said.
BEAR29|You're right about people perhaps wanting to hold on to Bitcoin now, but have you seen home prices lately?
NEUT30|'cause they're going up pretty quickly too.
NEUT31|So if you're trading Litecoin now for a house and you may see you may see great returns on the House as well.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
