BEAR0|"""Today I'm going to talk about Disney and why I think Disney is a good stock to invest in because of covid the stock fell and went down."
BEAR1|Because people stopped going to theme parks and they didn't realize that they would make the online business.
NEUT2|But now.
NEUT3|Disney has two businesses, one.
NEUT4|That is in person and one that is on line.
BULL5|Until now Netflix was winning.
NEUT6|But Disney caught up on that.
BULL7|An I think they improved a lot.
NEUT8|I was watching soul by Pixar and they made you hafting to subscribe.
NEUT9|Right now, if you want to buy the app, it is $6 and $95 a month, $0.95 a month.
NEUT10|If I realized if they raise the price $1.00 they will make $300 million.
NEUT11|Each month.
NEUT12|Parents will still subscribe to keep their kids quiet.
BEAR13|Disney will make a lot of money I think, but the risks are that Covid might continue and the stock will fall because people won't go to theme parks anymore and they use a lot of money to make those things happen to the competition with Netflix.
BEAR14|Which Netflix compete Disney 3 the economy goes down and Disney doesn't have that much money to continue doing their business.
NEUT15|For, the stock is also not cheap.
NEUT16|It is $170 my.
NEUT17|"Projection for the end of 2021 will be that they'll make $250 a share."""
