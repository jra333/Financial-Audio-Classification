BULL0|"""Coke and every big Corporation in America gets a big benefit because of the tax law that was passed."
NEUT1|You've talked about $22 billion overseas.
NEUT2|That code could tap if the president path you know if Congress and the President fast this tax reform, it happened.
NEUT3|What has the net result been for Coca Cola so far?
BULL4|Well, we're still working.
NEUT5|We're still working through a lot of a lot of the numbers are.
BULL6|I'm not sure will benefit on the top line number as much as some of the more domestically focused companies 'cause our tax rate last year was 24% on average, so there's not as bigger gappers some of the more domestic companies we got a lot of cash overseas so to speak.
NEUT7|Almost half of it is actually invested in other operations overseas so that the we're working through the numbers on what to do with it all.
NEUT8|It's not that we were short of capital to invest, but we're working through the details in November.
NEUT9|You said quote, it's not a short term change.
NEUT10|It's not like there's a big box of money out there that suddenly comes back and is reinvested in 2018 for us for you.
NEUT11|You saw what Apple did, bringing $200 billion back and announcing in tandem with it.
BULL12|Thousands of jobs being created.
NEUT13|What do you see Coke doing a let's just start with an on the job front.
BULL14|Do you think that this tax reform will allow Coke to create more jobs in America so well?
BULL15|I've talked about is how this credit will create jobs from our point of view is if this reform lifts economic growth rate, it will indirectly create extra demand for us.
NEUT16|Why that way?
NEUT17|Rather than some of the other companies because we virtually everything we make is local.
NEUT18|Virtually everything that sold in the US is made in the US.
NEUT19|Virtually everything they sold in.
NEUT20|France is made in France, everything so you have 22 billion overseas but we weren't sure money so it was it was a technicality and that's why I think it needed the territorial system reform.
BULL21|There's a slight reduction in that we're still working through how to think about allocating that between investments and the shareholders, but we've been investing all the way through so we will continue to create jobs in the US and elsewhere.
NEUT22|'cause it's fundamentally a local business.
BEAR23|You're not saying this will make us create thousands of new jobs.
NEUT24|It's not like we go.
NEUT25|We moved all these jobs to another country and now we're going to back again.
NEUT26|The jobs were always here.
BULL27|Great blue collar jobs in the Coke system and they're still here and they're going to be here.
NEUT28|What about wages?
BULL29|Wage increases.
BULL30|We've seen some wage increase announcements from big corporations.
BULL31|We've seen some bonuses from big corporations.
NEUT32|What does it mean for you guys in terms of wages, we're in the mix of deciding what to do.
NEUT33|"OK, taking it all forward."""
