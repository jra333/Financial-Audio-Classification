NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol IPWR."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT2|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT3|In case maybe new charts instead of Wendy's candle sticks here representing one days worth of price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT4|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT5|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT6|It's actually today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT7|I'll let you this time frame is a good job of telling the quote unquote story of the price, and then makes mapping out where levels of support and resistance a bit easier to see.
NEUT8|I'm in the state the obvious, but I will anyways.
NEUT9|Very nice movement today, not only from the price action perspective, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT10|So a lot of eyeballs on this one, so let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT11|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
BULL12|We say Clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be with the price and stay up there above the $0.50 mark.
NEUT13|Now.
NEUT14|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 50.
BEAR15|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage to stay up above $0.50.
BULL16|That would certainly be a huge sign of strength going forward.
NEUT17|Taking a step back and looking at things for more so the big picture point of view.
NEUT18|That is where the purple line here comes into play.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT21|So a very basic, yet highly effective way to judge the health of the move.
NEUT22|This right here being defined as the move.
NEUT23|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT24|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT25|How we can best visualize that.
NEUT26|That is what is being represented again.
BULL27|Yes, staying above $0.50 would be great.
NEUT28|However, from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart.
NEUT29|What about levels of resistance in terms of where the cells are hanging out at in the near term?
NEUT30|Right here at $0.57 you can see a whole bunch of times right there price try to get up through that level and couldn't quite do it, so that'll be the initial level.
NEUT31|If the price can push through there, then nothing complicated about this one other than the fact that you know this is where the party stopped today, up there at $0.63.
NEUT32|But as of right now you're getting too far ahead of yourself if you're talking about doing battle with $0.63 until the price can first prove itself in the shorter run, and again quote unquote prove itself being defined as getting up above that 57 cent mark.
BULL33|So on, although very nice movement today, it'll be interesting to see if the Bulls can build upon this momentum or not next week.
NEUT34|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT35|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT36|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT37|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT38|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT39|It's completely free.
NEUT40|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT41|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
