NEUT0|"""Is gold now passe no longer relevant in this age of cryptocurrencies?"
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL2|Will you get the insights you need to help navigate these turbulent times?
BULL3|Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have rocketed to the moon.
BEAR4|Commodities are rising sharply and stuck into see Set records day after day, but gold it has been dead in the water for months, leading a lot of observers to declare that the yellow metal is no longer a shield against excess money.
BEAR5|Printing a victim of high tech currencies.
NEUT6|The skeptics are wrong.
NEUT7|There are sound reasons why gold has been the best store of value for 4000 years.
BULL8|More reliable than any other commodity, including the new electronic varieties.
NEUT9|Here's why gold is rare, but not too rare.
BULL10|The gold supply grows, averaging an increase of nearly 2% a year despite advances in mining technology, that average is held, which is not true of other metals such as silver or copper.
NEUT11|The supply Bitcoin, in fact, is fixed.
NEUT12|It can't be destroyed.
NEUT13|It can't be consumed.
NEUT14|Every oz that's been mind is still in existence, which means you don't have supply shocks as you would say with wheat.
BEAR15|If there's a drought that sends the price up sharply.
NEUT16|Gold is easy to store and transport, unlike oil, it can't be hacked.
NEUT17|For centuries countless attempts were made to replicate the yellow metal in the laboratory, which was called alchemy.
NEUT18|The alchemists always failed, which is a contrast to diamonds which can be artificially created.
NEUT19|So why hasn't the price of gold surged recently?
BULL20|Critics overlooked that the yellow metal went up around 50% between summer 2019 and the summer of 2020.
NEUT21|Since then, banks have been holding lots of cash, as have consumers, but that is about to change big time.
BULL22|The Biden administration is determined to shovel out the $1 trillion from previous pandemic relief measures that remains unspent.
NEUT23|It'll soon try to ram through Congress.
NEUT24|Another COVID-19 bill of almost $2 trillion.
BULL25|Now that number might be trimmed, but it will still be a whopper.
NEUT26|The White House wants to follow that with an additional $3 trillion for infrastructure, and it wants the Federal Reserve to print the money to pay for all of this, which the Fed seems all too willing to do.
BEAR27|As this tsunami of cash floods through the economy in the second half of this year and going into next year, inflation will surge and so will the price of gold.
NEUT28|Of course, Washington may try to prevent a serious inflation by, say, jawboning banks to reduce the volume of new loans by the Fed paying high interest rates on banks excess reserves, but don't count on it.
NEUT29|Washington seems oblivious to the coming danger.
NEUT30|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL31|Thanks for listening.
BULL32|"Do send in your comments and suggestions and look forward to being with you soon again."""
