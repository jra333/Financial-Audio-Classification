BULL0|"""In this video I will show you a cryptocurrency that has been skyrocketing, with the hope that this upturn will continue."

NEUT4|I also make videos on stocks and other investments.
NEUT5|And to my regular viewers, what's up?
BULL6|Welcome back with that being said.
NEUT7|Let's jump right into the video.
NEUT8|Let's talk money.
NEUT9|The quick I want to start by warning my community.
NEUT10|Well, what's been going on in the comment section.
BEAR11|There have been several fake accounts they're trying to impersonate me.
NEUT12|They reply back to comments telling others to contact them for training advice.
NEUT13|Do not contact them, ignore them, and if you want to be extra mile, click on their portfolio and report them.
NEUT14|I will never ask anyone who contact me for training advice or to send me bitcoins.
NEUT15|Anyways, back to the video data.
NEUT16|Is a video streaming platform.
NEUT17|So imagine a decentralized version of YouTube that will rely on blockchain technology.
NEUT18|They'd's mission is to improve video streaming.
BEAR19|Quality Streaming HD is very expensive and inaccessible in some parts of the world.
NEUT20|Also, content creators have to give up a cut of their revenue to a third party for using the streaming platform.
BEAR21|Data, however, is decentralized and will eliminate that middleman corner coin market cap.
NEUT22|Data holds the 11th largest market cap in the crypto world with a market cap will approximately $10 billion have a maximum supply of 1 billion coins, with all coins being presented at the time of launch.
NEUT23|I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT24|You should always be doing your own due diligence, but in my opinion this is a pretty revolutionary idea.
NEUT25|Video streaming is not going anywhere now.
BULL26|We're just looking for ways to improve its efficiency.
NEUT27|Let's take a look at the price fluctuation of data.
NEUT28|We had bought data back in 2018 or 2019.
NEUT29|You have likely paid under $0.20 for each coin.
BULL30|In 2020, data began to gain some traction and close 2020.
BEAR31|Around $2.00 2020 one this uptrend continued.
NEUT32|March 22nd, 2021.
BULL33|Just a few hours before this video was released, data reached an all time high of $10.74.
NEUT34|This corn has been really volatile lately and especially today, so by the time you watch this video, it's likely the price of this coin will be significantly different.
NEUT35|So where do you invite data?
NEUT36|The following are a few crypto exchanges where you are able to purchase data, finance, WABI and kucoin.
NEUT37|This coin is growing exponentially, so eventually there will be a big correction when that will happen, it's almost impossible to predict, but in my opinion, if you're going to be on display, it's best to go in for the long run.
NEUT38|I think this one has a ton of room to run, but I'm going to say a big conservative.
NEUT39|"My price prediction for Theta is that by the end of 2021 there will be trading at $50 on the lower end or $70.00 on the higher end."""
