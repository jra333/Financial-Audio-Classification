BULL0|"""Hello everyone in welcome back to market craze."
NEUT1|My name is Steven in I'm going to be telling you guys all about AMC an my price predictions on AMC.
NEUT2|Alright so I'm sure we have all heard about the news in everything going around.
NEUT3|AMC, GameStop, BlackBerry etc etc.
NEUT4|I'm sure we've all heard about it by now.
NEUT5|I mean it's been absolutely crazy.
NEUT6|There's been news articles after news articles, Twitter trends, a lot of people joining the Wallstreetbets, Reddit and Discord Server.
NEUT7|So there's been a lot of attention towards AMC and GameStop, of course, and I've been seeing a lot of people on social media asking if they should get into AMC and GameStop.
BEAR8|Come Monday morning, there is a thing called the fear of missing out, which is a very real problem that a lot of people have, and they think that hey, if they don't get in now, they could miss out on hundreds if not millions of dollars.
NEUT9|And do I think AMC is going to go to the moon?
NEUT10|This is a question that I have been asked a lot and the question that I honestly ask myself a lot look.
NEUT11|I will always give you real with you guys and I don't want to just pump something up.
NEUT12|You know, for my own gain, you know bring some attention to something for my own personal gain, I do think AMC could have a possibility of hitting 52, possibly 100.
NEUT13|A lot of people out there think it's going to be exactly like GameStop an I just think that is kind of a claim that is not easily backed.
NEUT14|You know, I think that that is a claim that is not easily obtainable and don't don't even think that that's just me shooting down AMC so that I can get in or whatever.
NEUT15|I don't even have very many subscribers, so I can't even do that, but plus I really do want AMC to succeed, but I just don't see it going above 100 an.
NEUT16|Honestly, I would advise a lot of people to take some profits at $50.
NEUT17|Do I think that you should get an AMC right now?
NEUT18|It is a possibility an you could honestly take some profit getting into AMC right now, but you have to really know that this could be a huge risk in my opinion.
NEUT19|A lot of people just don't understand that and they're just like, yeah, AMC to the moon.
BEAR20|And while that's all fine and dandy, AMC could definitely take a huge crash Monday morning.
NEUT21|I do think that it will jump back up Monday morning if it does take crash, so if it does start taking a crash, you might want to get in there.
NEUT22|And I don't know.
BEAR23|Drop like $1020.00 on it.
NEUT24|You don't really have to go too crazy.
NEUT25|Like if it's $7.00 a share an you really want to see.
NEUT26|Maybe you can make some money.
BEAR27|Go ahead and drop like 14 to you know.
NEUT28|$21 on it.
NEUT29|Get through two to three shares but hey I am not a financial advisor so please do not take.
NEUT30|Any of this as financial advice, please do your own due diligence and do your own research.
NEUT31|I love to see what you guys think AMC could reach by Monday morning.
NEUT32|You guys saying it's going to $100?
NEUT33|You're saying it might even go to 500 or 1000.
NEUT34|I would love to see what you guys have to think about AMC and what you guys think about AMC an I love to see what you guys think about Wall Street bets.
NEUT35|I thought that it was awesome and I think that it's hilarious that were screwing over Wall Street.
BEAR36|But anyway guys this was TH even with market craze trading.
BULL37|Anne, I hope you guys have a great rest your day in.
BULL38|"I'm signing out peace."""
