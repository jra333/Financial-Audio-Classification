NEUT0|"""His claim this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link also from disclosure standpoint I do own Apple in my retirement account from the long side, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
NEUT3|Well, we got a couple of bits of confirmation here.
NEUT4|First bit of confirmation is that, yeah, this level appear right around 1:17 fifty, which is the red line, right?
NEUT5|There is not impossible to break.
NEUT6|Problem is actually maintaining the breakout.
NEUT7|What I mean?
NEUT8|Well, right there you can see the price actually broke up above it, but when it came to maintaining that stain above the level failed once again.
BULL9|Got up above that level.
NEUT10|But once it came to actually staying above that level, maintaining the break failed.
NEUT11|So one 1750 going to be one of, you know, it's one of those annoying levels, apparently, where.
NEUT12|It's not a matter of getting up above that level, but it's almost one of those tricky levels that likes to let the price get up above it and then almost just said just kidding and then the price goes right back down below it.
NEUT13|So keep a close eye on that moving forward.
NEUT14|As you know the main area of resistance.
NEUT15|But just because the price does get above it again, be warned that I'd be.
NEUT16|I'd still be a little sceptical until the price can first prove that it's then they able to actually stay up above it.
NEUT17|So watch that level closely from the resistance out of things.
NEUT18|As far as areas of support and concern.
NEUT19|Good news here is that 112 fifty was that key level for the reasons discussed in previous videos and you know.
NEUT20|Just because the price isn't really down there low, I'm not going to go into all those reasons.
NEUT21|You can just go back on the video archive if you want to watch why that level is important.
BULL22|So good to see that the price not only did that level hold, but it's not like it was even test or anything like that in the near term.
NEUT23|Actually got a little miniature area of support right here at right around the one 1350 Mark so that level could hold.
BULL24|That would be even better going forward.
NEUT25|But really, from the overarching standpoint, the level that matters most is going to be.
NEUT26|The one 1250 mark.
NEUT27|So let's see how this one continues to play out, but overall, those are the main levels of support going forward.
NEUT28|Crazy day in the markets and once again one of those situations where Apple looking like it's building those higher base is looking like it maybe wants to make another move to the upside, but we'll see how things play out on Wednesday.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL32|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT37|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
