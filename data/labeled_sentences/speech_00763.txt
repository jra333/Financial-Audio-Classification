NEUT0|"""What is the significance of the sedan ET72 Neo going forward?"
NEUT1|Do one less so it is 7CET7 is Neo's first self-driving car?
BULL2|It sufficiently shows Neos capability in autonomous driving and it's also our first sedan in mass production.
NEUT3|The pricing of the sedan.
BULL4|It's close to about 70,000 U.S. dollars before subsidy's, so almost twice the price of a Tesla Model 3.
NEUT5|Are you concerned at all about the pricing?
NEUT6|Are you comfortable with the pricing at this level?
NEUT7|So warm laid down with me is the 5th unteachable.
NEUT8|We're always very clear about our target user groups.
NEUT9|For example, the price of RET seven is similar to the ones of the best selling midsize or full size sedans in China.
NEUT10|Like BMWs, five class, Audi A6, Mercedes-Benz E Class, their sales numbers are at around 10,000 cars per month.
BULL11|Our strategy for the Chinese market is to provide better products.
NEUT12|In service at a similar price of gasoline cars.
NEUT13|You tabbed or use her the junk we of course believe as an autonomous car.
BULL14|It's worth the price as the best vehicle in the premium market in any aspect from every detail of its design, internal space to service.
NEUT15|Agent Adalah so premium delicious honey.
BEAR16|And in fact after the launch, many from our user, community and media think the pricing is probably a little low.
BEAR17|Hudson native finding control and general manager Tina Turner had deleted the competition.
BULL18|Obviously with Tesla continues to heat up.
NEUT19|Do you see the ET7's putting you and Neo in a different class?
NEUT20|She's a tongue more than someone with a client, so the size the ET 7 is not a car competing with Tesla's Model 3.
NEUT21|If comparisons are to be made, it is more of a rival to the Model S. The 87 is very competitive.
NEUT22|Based on this market position.
BULL23|In terms of deliveries that we see more broadly for Neo, yeah, December, the numbers were very good.
BULL24|Again, more than 100% increase year on year in terms of deliveries.
BULL25|Yeah, so you see that pace of sales at pace of growth continuing this year downward sounds in Tigne and I of course believe China's EV market will keep growing this year.
BULL26|Neo is prepared for such growth.
NEUT27|China's EV market had a big change last year.
BULL28|The percentage of personal purchase has been increasing.
BULL29|Which means EV has become a rational choice for many Chinese consumers.
NEUT30|Yourself, it's all there you go.
NEUT31|Face hungry Cindy Goshen.
BULL32|So now we think it's very positive.
BULL33|We are very confident that Neo has room for growth in terms of our market segment.
NEUT34|Engine or missing interface?
NEUT35|Ever since I met William, can you update us on your international expansion plans?
NEUT36|What are your priority markets and what is the time frame that we're looking at?
NEUT37|Ourmedia Armin trilogy.
BULL38|While darling, we have clear plans to enter the European market this year.
NEUT39|We will gain experience from a specific country and region to understand how to meet the needs of local users, how to introduce Neos community culture to different countries.
NEUT40|Communities and one far from this perspective, we still have work to do.
NEUT41|"Then go along tattoo symbols on the young who."""
