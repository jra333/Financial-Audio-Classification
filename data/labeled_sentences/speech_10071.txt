NEUT8|& up for that.
NEUT9|So let's get into the video.
BULL10|This was a key resistance level.
NEUT11|As you can see it came as resistance.
BEAR12|It tried to come back down to support it, but that fell went back through.
NEUT13|Try to get up here again, resisted, resistant, resistant and fall every time to get up here has a deep fall deep fall default.
NEUT14|So this is a key resistance level you could put in your chart.
NEUT15|This level is 1893.
NEUT16|So just in case, prices go back up here, you want to watch that price and if it does go up here and test is a support and see confirmation here that it wants to go back up then that would be a good key entry to buy on to look for higher prices to around the 25 area up there.
NEUT17|So about right now this is our support level right now at 1623.
NEUT18|We want price to hold this level.
BULL19|As you can see it kinda is doing it this a little bit and comes back up kind of holding support even right here.
NEUT20|It drove through but it came right back up.
NEUT21|So it's kind of trading in this range right now, but you wanted to hold this price level at 1623.
NEUT22|To still stay kind of neutral to bullish now but not bearish, but if it breaks this level, this is the last defense before I turn very bearish.
BEAR23|And I think price will go down to around $9 and this will be $15.00 right here at Broadway down to 9 'cause.
BEAR24|That is when I see around the last support.
NEUT25|So hold here we can still stay neutral.
NEUT26|Probably won't be playing it too much, or you could just play it in this range, right?
NEUT27|You can just play it in the training range.
NEUT28|But right now we plan it too much until it either breaks this level, so I know it wants to get bullish or it breaks this level, so I know it wants to get bearish, but just watch these support levels.
NEUT29|It will let you know what the stock is going to do.
NEUT30|And I'll update you guys in the future, but just make sure you have these three levels on your chart.
BULL31|Alright, so hope you guys like the video.
