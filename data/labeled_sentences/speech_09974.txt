NEUT0|"""If you were in charge right now, Bill, maybe even the President of United States."
NEUT1|What would you do?
NEUT2|Well, you know trying to denigrate Doctor Fouchy probably isn't the best approach.
NEUT3|You want the experts to get the airtime.
NEUT4|Let them talk about you know what drug trials have worked, which ones haven't.
NEUT5|Don't mislead people on those things, and you know the USC DC is a very capable organization.
NEUT6|The best in the world.
NEUT7|You know, Doctor Fouchy and I talk.
NEUT8|On a regular basis about this innovation pipeline and how our foundation and NHR funding both the first wave of vaccines and then a second wave of vaccines.
NEUT9|And so the capacity to do this right exists in the country.
NEUT10|You just build a website.
NEUT11|But the CDC's name on it, and it will prioritize who who should get tested.
NEUT12|You get the message about masks to be a, you know, kind of bar bipartisan.
NEUT13|Let's protect.
NEUT14|Other people type message and then you engage in the complex discussion about which things it's beneficial to reopen.
NEUT15|Like you know, perhaps kids under 15, whereas schools for older kids in communities with lots of infection.
NEUT16|Sadly, you probably aren't going to be able to do in person.
NEUT17|Should you mention mass?
NEUT18|Should mass be nationally mandated bill?
NEUT19|Well, the downside to wearing a mask is so low that I mean, I don't.
NEUT20|I can't understand why you know it's.
NEUT21|It's even a controversy at all.
NEUT22|The mask is cheap.
NEUT23|It's easy to wear, has no negative effects if you're going outside your house, you put on a mask because you'll end up getting close to people.
NEUT24|And we know this is not a copying disease.
NEUT25|Just talking can expel the virus.
NEUT26|Do you think about things like the bills in Congress in terms of the relief, the stimulus package?
NEUT27|Or is that kind of the stuff that you you weigh in on?
NEUT28|Or have you thought about how that should go?
NEUT29|But the expertise of our foundation is more.
NEUT30|Around.
NEUT31|The disease tools themselves, and so yes, there are elements of these supplemental allocations that are very, very important to us.
NEUT32|How we fund the therapeutics in the vaccines, including not just the United States we're trying to get 1% of the bill that's under discussion now to go to buy vaccines for the developing countries, because not only would that save lives and have this great humanitarian and strategic.
BULL33|Benefit in terms of US leadership.
NEUT34|It's also the only thing that will stop the disease from coming back to our country.
NEUT35|And so the idea that you know 1%.
NEUT36|You know gives you shows that the US cares.
NEUT37|Yes, we funded a lot of R&D, but we haven't funded the procurement for these poor countries, which historically in every global health thing, whether it's smallpox or polio or HIV or Ebola, the US is there not just in a selfish way.
BULL38|Funding its own factories but also helping out the entire world, and so that's a very compelling case.
NEUT39|And so I am every day talking to people in government.
NEUT40|"People at drug companies trying to make sure that we get money for the entire world."""
