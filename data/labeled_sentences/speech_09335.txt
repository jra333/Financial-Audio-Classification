NEUT0|"""Like a black hole in movie production, isn't it among the big days?"
NEUT1|It's almost more like a deer in headlights, right?
NEUT2|I mean you've got movies that are done.
NEUT3|I mean, there's plenty of movies that are shot and done and ready to be released.
NEUT4|The theaters say there you know I saw Mookie on CNBC yesterday.
NEUT5|I think Julia was interviewing him.
NEUT6|The CEO of Cineworld, and he's talking about theaters, or quote unquote safe.
NEUT7|The reality is, it doesn't really matter.
NEUT8|The consumer spoken.
NEUT9|The consumer isn't comfortable going back and sitting in indoor movie theaters.
NEUT10|The numbers on tenant with no competition around the world.
NEUT11|Forget about New York being closed.
NEUT12|The number of people that went to see this movie relative to what needs to see a movie to make it profitable.
NEUT13|The theater.
NEUT14|The theater goes.
NEUT15|We're just not there yet.
NEUT16|Like the consumer is just not comfortable with indoor movie theaters yet.
NEUT17|And it's just going to take time and I think that's why Hollywood is shutting down because they don't really have an outlet.
NEUT18|They can't put them out directly.
BULL19|I mean, NBC Universal did an amazing job with trolls going direct to consumer in the height of the pandemic.
NEUT20|Making it available for $20.
NEUT21|That worked well for a relatively small movie, but billion dollar type movies.
NEUT22|That is not a solution and so you can't do what you know you can't do the premium video on demand at 20 to $30 move on certainly didn't work.
NEUT23|You can't put him out in theaters and So what you've sort of run into is, unless you're willing to embrace the Netflix model, which nobody seems to, you're basically in a waiting game.
NEUT24|So it's not that.
NEUT25|That movie sets are dangerous, and at that they're not making him.
NEUT26|It's that there's no reason to make it because no one is going to see it.
NEUT27|It's it's.
NEUT28|It's got to be a combination of all those things though, right?
NEUT29|Actually, Joe, I would say what's interesting is movie production is starting again.
NEUT30|I mean, you know, Tom Cruise is filming Mission Impossible.
NEUT31|Avatar two just wrapped in, I think New Zealand.
BEAR32|The crazy part about this in many ways is that movie production is restarting it slow, and it's very cumbersome and more expensive and more time consuming.
BEAR33|But you're actually like it's like a pile up.
NEUT34|I mean, if you think about like on the high woman you got like a.
BEAR35|13 car pileup.
BEAR36|Like the pileup is building right now because you can't release these films.
NEUT37|There's no outlet for them in theaters and so it's sort of this oddity where Hollywood's making more movies but doesn't really have an outlet to distribute them right now.
NEUT38|And that's going to be a really interesting event for, you know, as you move into 21, I mean, I don't think many movies are coming out until sort of summer.
NEUT39|21.
NEUT40|Is it over or is it going to be like sports?
NEUT41|Where when, when?
NEUT42|If there's a vaccine?
NEUT43|Or if the if this finally lifts?
NEUT44|Are there going to be a lot of pent up demand to get back in there or?
BEAR45|For all these theaters you know half of them are going to be closed and the employees are never coming back.
NEUT46|Well, I mean look the longer this goes two things.
BEAR47|One I don't think most of these theater companies are prepared for this financially, and I think most likely scenario is that most of them file for bankruptcy protection.
NEUT48|Remember we've seen the theaters.
NEUT49|This is not a new thing.
NEUT50|The theaters have gone bankrupt before they were, you know, over levered.
BULL51|They expanded too fast once before.
NEUT52|I think what probably needs to happen.
BEAR53|Joe is that you probably need, you know the theaters to go bankrupt, shrink their footprints.
NEUT54|We don't need 40,000 movie screens in the US.
NEUT55|We might need 10,000.
NEUT56|We need to make it more of an event may view.
BULL57|I know you've had rich Gelfond on from IMAX.
NEUT58|The experience of going to a movie needs to feel more IMAX like more event like to get you out of the home and I think the longer the pandemic lasts, the longer theaters are vacant with movies, the more likely the consumer behavior starts to shift.
NEUT59|I mean in the month of October alone, there's 20 plus movies on Netflix, so Netflix is Gunning Direct to consumer movies on the streaming platform.
BEAR60|That's going to start to alter behavior.
NEUT61|I mean the number 5 movie or the number five title on Netflix right now is a movie called.
NEUT62|Post war movie, so there's a lot of movies coming out or just not workers.
NEUT63|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT64|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
