NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Erin."
NEUT1|I am a professional astrologer, current philosophy graduate student, an entrepreneur.
NEUT2|When is the right time to trade Bitcoin?
NEUT3|Could the answers be in the Sky, the cryptocurrencies, mysterious movements baffle many financial analysts.
NEUT4|Enter Marron Altman.
NEUT5|Bitcoin investor and astrologia.
NEUT6|I'm skipping plastic illness right now because I felt like getting this out instead of going to.
NEUT7|A philosophy class.
NEUT8|The 22 year old has been following the movements of celestial objects to predict price fluctuations since last summer.
BULL9|And while many people may mock her methods, she's built up a 1,000,000 strong following on Tik T.O.K.
BEAR10|My tick tock on this absolutely blew up a few months ago.
NEUT11|In my readings when I see this coming up, I know there was a huge scale breakthrough.
NEUT12|If you're excited to look at the upcoming astrology for Bitcoin for 2021, make sure that you like subscribe, hit that notification Bell so you never miss with the stars.
NEUT13|Have in store for you.
BEAR14|Financially or otherwise, earlier this year, The New Yorker told her followers to watch for a price correction.
NEUT15|On January the 11th.
NEUT16|Why?
NEUT17|Because Saturn was going to cross Mercury.
NEUT18|Exactly, I agree will be on the big coin.
BEAR19|Indeed, Bitcoin fell 21% on that day before recovering most of its losses, slamming the brakes on a meteoric rally that seen the cryptocurrency double from early December to a record $42,000 at the beginning of January.
NEUT20|You might have doubted me, but it looks like the atomic expansion energy is here.
NEUT21|I get a lot of people as a joke, saying things like I trust you with my life or like things like that, and I think that a lot of it is satire because I think a lot of people do understand that I'm not in Oracle.
NEUT22|I'm just someone who studies patterns and I'm good at studying patterns.
NEUT23|I don't feel comfortable making any financial advice like I don't tell people when to buy your cell.
NEUT24|I'm looking at price trends, but that depends on you.
NEUT25|Like I dollar cost average, I do you buy based on my own predictive data, but I also just buying on a regular basis and investing and whatnot.
NEUT26|But how does it work?
NEUT27|For the uninitiated Mercury, the planet represents bitcoins price data and Saturn is a restricting indicator.
NEUT28|So astrology can be thought of like a giant mirror or a symbolic language where certain signifiers of planetary alignments are archetypes and they represent themes in the world like growth or restriction or aggression or peace.
NEUT29|And when we look how that is interplaying with the chart of the given moment.
NEUT30|Whether that is a human life or a company, when we look at how the current Sky is overlaying on top of something that's already created, we can see how current events are impacting on something that's already happened.
NEUT31|So what do the stars have in store for Bitcoin in the coming months?
BULL32|"Morin says she sees favorable indicators in February and early March, but a big price correction mid March and that May will be bullish."""
