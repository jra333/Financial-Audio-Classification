NEUT0|"""Welcome back, it's a 22nd of July 2020, Wednesday or Thursday after week, so we have just done you coming in over 22 New York Cosmos Theorem, Classic Dash, inaugural 1/2 Z cash."
NEUT1|Coming in about 28 with the ticker ZECT.
BEAR2|So for the cash against BTC I feel like the cash is actually in a rising wage here.
NEUT3|I feel like when arising which yes we have targets towards the top but I don't know if you're going to be rising towards the top line because previously we've identified a potential.
NEUT4|Abcd.
BEAR5|Kind of a chop it down here, but at the same time we've also identified a rising which so the signals are mixed for Z cash at a point.
NEUT6|That is my point in time.
NEUT7|It all depends upon BTC.
BULL8|If BDC decides to go higher than more likely than not, Zika should be touching its target.
BEAR9|If PDC starts to collapse, then very likely see cash is going to collapse as well.
NEUT10|So there we go.
NEUT11|There's our thoughts for this situation will be very careful about.
NEUT12|Going shot going long because we're still not entirely sure we actually broke out of the ABCD right?
BULL13|Boom, we retested the support men we rally, but this is quite a I don't know this is this is looking to me like a potential.
NEUT14|Shooting star here and shooting stars are reversal chemist icsan.
BEAR15|We could actually drop back down under the.
NEUT16|Driving under the ABCD chocolate and the support line here over here.
NEUT17|Yeah we could drop back down South.
NEUT18|The danger is is there because to go lower.
BULL19|Of course at the same time we could also go higher.
NEUT20|So be very very careful about going to a trip to soon.
NEUT21|Alright tell us we want to see cash against USD, but before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT22|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about the cash in the comments below.
BULL23|So we catch against USD again.
NEUT24|We're not particularly overbought, right, and we're not particularly over salt for a very long time.
NEUT25|We have been in the purple area.
NEUT26|Nothing much has been happening, except we've been forming higher highs, higher highs, right?
NEUT27|Yeah, it's just like never ending higher highs.
NEUT28|Very, very incremental pushes.
NEUT29|Towards the upside we correct.
NEUT30|We push, we correctly push, we correct, we push, we quietly push, correct we push your correct we push are we going to correct and push higher incorrect and she refused to me like we are?
NEUT31|Kind of curving back down, you know.
NEUT32|Potentially we could be coming coming back down, so be very careful about going to a trade too soon, but at the same time we could also go higher.
NEUT33|We could form an inverse head and shoulders over here for the cash right shoulder, right shoulder animal could be blasting off.
NEUT34|It could absolutely happen, so watch out for that.
BEAR35|The potential is there, but at the same time we could also be dropping lower.
NEUT36|So be very careful about going to a trip to suit all right.
NEUT37|So I guess that's it for my vacation.
BULL38|Alloces, thank you very much for watching.
BULL39|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT40|I shall see you in the.
NEUT41|"Next video."""
