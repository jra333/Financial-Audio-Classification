NEUT0|"""It's clear in this video chart on ticker symbol NAK, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well another day, higher highs and higher lows.
BULL4|So from a trend building perspective everything is humming along just fine.
NEUT5|An from the analysis standpoint and presentation standpoint, certainly some updates here need to be made so one of the newest levels of support that needs to be put in place is what I would call the newest ideal level of support.
NEUT6|Ideal meaning Rascal, you know won't make this chart look the absolute best going forward, and ideally Speaking of price can now stay above $0.75.
BULL7|That would certainly be a great sign of power.
NEUT8|Now don't get me wrong if the price falls below 75, does that mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that?
NEUT9|Absolutely not, but yeah.
NEUT10|The price can manager actually stay above that level.
BULL11|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move.
NEUT17|That right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT18|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT19|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control and best visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yes and above 75 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT21|They just really don't matter.
NEUT22|What do I mean by that?
NEUT23|What matters the most is what the price has been doing and continues to do, and that's this, right here just chipping away and building those higher loads.
NEUT24|Or if you want to visit their steps.
NEUT25|So in other words, as long as the stair steps continue to construct themselves in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT26|So folks, unhealthy consolidations, folks on chipping away, and those higher bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL30|To being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT36|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
