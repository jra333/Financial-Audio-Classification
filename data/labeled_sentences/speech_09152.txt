BULL0|"""Alright, well from other things that might make your mom not proud or shifting from cannabis to crypto, Bitcoin is continuing its 2019 rally now more than 100% on the year, topping $8000 for the first time since July."
BULL1|Reasons as to why we've seen a 50% rally in the crypto for the month of May range.
NEUT2|From brokerages like TD Ameritrade, and Fidelity signaling, they were toying with the idea of adding crypto currency trading to their platforms to stock markets, selling off to tech companies like Microsoft announcing they would be building off the Bitcoin blockchain.
NEUT3|And then of course, guys.
NEUT4|Conveniently, it is New York Blockchain Week where the lambos at.
NEUT5|Yeah, people say that that hype normally drives bitcoins price hiring.
NEUT6|I just landed here like you gotta tell me how big they say blockchain week.
NEUT7|Yeah, the big big crypto chain people for Bitcoin people.
NEUT8|Yeah, so they gather you have a convention during the day.
NEUT9|Then they go out and party at night.
NEUT10|Last year it was really ridiculous.
NEUT11|There were Lamborghinis parked outside.
NEUT12|They were really than you finance Bros.
NEUT13|Essentially they were the Crypto Bros. Ethereally consensus all these conventions with all these crypto fans coming out and as well as businesses.
NEUT14|I mean, that's where we kind of mentioned here.
NEUT15|I mean, we're seeing Microsoft building Bitcoin Blockchain, Facebook introducing their own cryptocurrency plans as well, so tech companies getting increasingly interested in the space and that somehow normally drives the price higher just historically.
NEUT16|From what we've seen, right?
BEAR17|Because the Bulls have been saying institutional love is going to drive up the price of Bitcoin, but that has always confused me.
NEUT18|Always seems ironic because a lot of the people that were interested in Bitcoin in the beginning that got into it.
NEUT19|It was because they didn't believe in the banks, right?
NEUT20|They didn't believe in the large banks and they wanted a separate currency of sorts to kind of use an on the black market or whatever reason it might have been, but now the Bulls are saying we need the institutional investors to get into it.
BULL21|We need their love in order for the Bitcoin price to go up.
BEAR22|It just seems very contradictory to me and it just seems like a I don't know what they need.
NEUT23|Is their money really is what they need?
BEAR24|They need the money to be flowing in and as we're seeing Bitcoins, price continues to creep higher.
NEUT25|Although right now it's slightly below 8000.
BULL26|It did surpass that level.
BEAR27|Again, a big strong running from, but that 6000 level had been support for awhile.
BEAR28|It broke below that, but that was serving as resistance shot back above it.
NEUT29|Right now it looks like it's going to stay up there but we have to wait and see.
NEUT30|I think it's too soon to tell.
NEUT31|I spoke to our very own Jerrod Blicker who broke down the charts for me and that's what he had informed us to watch.
NEUT32|So the charts and specifically his resistance and support levels in Bitcoin.
NEUT33|No different than any other.
NEUT34|"Any other thing that we look at."""
