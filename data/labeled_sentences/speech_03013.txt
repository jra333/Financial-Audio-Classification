BULL0|"""Hey there everyone."
NEUT1|Tonsil Basecamp trading it is.
NEUT2|Monday, June 22nd and we're going to look here at Facebook and talk a little bit about what's going on with this market and what we see happening here over the next few days.
NEUT3|But before we dive in here, make sure you like and subscribe to the YouTube channel if you haven't already done so.
NEUT4|That way you can stay up to date on any new setups or developments that we talk about here on a daily basis now.
NEUT5|With that being said, let's dive in here with Facebook and talk a little about the pending setup here.
BEAR6|So what we're watching Facebook's been compressing sideways now since the end of May here.
NEUT7|As for the nice channel and we have well defined resistance right back here from the two pivot highs up at about 2241 in a quarter or we tagged at once here and then tag it again couple weeks ago and now we're up testing it for the third time.
NEUT8|So what we're watching for with Facebook is for a break above that 241 and a quarter level now.
BULL9|One thing I want you to notice is our upside swings here on our incrementum histograms are actually strengthening a little bit, so we are picking up a little bit upside strength leading into this resistance test.
NEUT10|So I am anticipating.
BULL11|Facebook breaking out to the upside here over the next couple of days.
NEUT12|So that's one of the things I'm I'm watching for in position for here on long shares in calls in Facebook.
NEUT13|Binlong shares for years, but.
NEUT14|Call since Friday.
NEUT15|So I'm looking for this thing to move higher on their resistance break.
BULL16|But the trigger here to really build the position and I'll add to my existing position is we need to get above 241 in 1/4, so that's why I'm watching for everything.
BULL17|Looks good.
BULL18|I like that we have a higher low here.
BULL19|We've maintained higher pivot lows on this way up, which is good.
BULL20|We have well defined resistance at the highs, which is good.
NEUT21|Now we're just looking forward to break out of compression once it breaks out of compression.
NEUT22|Above that 241 quarter level then we should be clear for Facebook to continue to run.
NEUT23|To the upside, over two or three day.
NEUT24|Look for something similar to what we had back with Spotify or Salesforce until recently, but that's going to be it for today.
BULL25|Hope it helps.
NEUT26|I will see you in that room bright and early tomorrow morning.
NEUT27|Good luck and so next time everybody.
NEUT28|"Happy trading."""
