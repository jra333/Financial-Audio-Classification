NEUT0|"""Hey Ryan, here today let's take a deeper look at Walt Disney and see why it was up today."
NEUT1|Part of this was due to the fact that they release news stating that they are in the next stage of the reopening process.
NEUT2|This includes opening Magic Kingdom and Disney's Hollywood Studios.
NEUT3|This is big considering this is a significant amount of their revenue.
NEUT4|Let's take a look at the technical analysis and their chart to see what we can expect going forward.
BULL5|Can they make it back up to the pre coronavirus levels?
NEUT6|Let's take a deeper look.
NEUT7|Let's look at the one day chart for Disney.
NEUT8|As you can see, I drew in lines of resistance.
NEUT9|But these have been occurring prior to the coronavirus.
NEUT10|As you can see the dip here.
BULL11|However, working pretty close back up to those same levels, historical levels to that of prior to the corners.
BULL12|So potentially we're going to start hitting these resistance is going up to potentially an all time high.
NEUT13|So the ones that we had to lookout for really are the 135 level.
NEUT14|138 142 and then the all time high is.
NEUT15|Right there about 1:50 looks like.
NEUT16|Taking a look at the 30 minute time frame now I labeled 2 levels of support that we can see going forward, one at 131, which it hit a couple days ago and the other one we kind of ended the day on was the 135 five.
NEUT17|We saw this can get rejected after this a couple days ago, but it did break through it today and then.
NEUT18|It kind of stayed above it.
NEUT19|So it is a support.
NEUT20|So let's see if it can continue its uptrend.
NEUT21|One other tool we can use is the Fibonacci extension here on the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT22|We use this intraday value to have a swing low position to the swing high and it did propagate some other levels of resistance so we have that one at 137 and another one at 139.
NEUT23|So these are in between.
BULL24|Historical values that we saw previously, but they could still be useful because these are pretty wide and there's probably going to be some resistance levels in between here and so.
BULL25|This is a good indicator that we potentially will have these going forward.
BEAR26|Does these really been hurting because of its park closures?
BULL27|And so any news of reopening is really going to bolster the stock price, so I think.
BULL28|In the future, once coronavirus related Reopenings start to occur, the stock price should really head up North, considering it's already back up to almost where it was before the coronavirus, I'd recommend investing in Disney whenever possible.
NEUT29|It's it's been around for a long time and it's it's pretty much a staple.
