NEUT7|I am not a financial advisor an please do your own due diligence when investing Shopify's valuation, Shopify's forward PE ratio of about 476 speaks to how expensive the stock has become.
BULL8|Moreover, the fact that Shopify Stock sells for almost 61 times sales confirms this Sky high valuation.
