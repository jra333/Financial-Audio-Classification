BEAR0|"""Hey guys, what's up?"
NEUT1|It's today it's your regular Robin Hood Wrangler here.
NEUT2|Fact added today again with another stock review.
NEUT3|Today is June 25th, 2020 and actually I'm going to show you how I did today.
BEAR4|As you can see in the past week, it's actually been pretty rough for me dropping down nearly 9% in one week, but you know, we bounced back a little today and I'm only down 6%.
BULL5|So today we rose nearly 2%.
BEAR6|I would say it's a pretty good start, as you can see the big jump was at the pre market today and it's been a little up and down throughout the day.
BEAR7|But I ended up around up like $24.00, not tearable, better days, worse days.
NEUT8|It's alright.
NEUT9|But today we're going to take a look at the allegiance stock.
NEUT10|Now for all of you who don't know, Alegent is this large airline.
NEUT11|They fly airbuses to run the fastest growing airlines in America.
BULL12|Pretty good stock to get into.
NEUT13|You go and check out the one week.
BEAR14|Well, actually this is a bad example, but overall they've been.
BEAR15|It's been a slow climb back up.
BEAR16|They kind of went above their actual value and that's why this week they're going back down.
NEUT17|I personally think this is a pretty good stock to get into, because as you can see coronavirus hit them hard.
BULL18|You can see before it their stock was over 161 seventy doing pretty good.
BULL19|So for it to be 106 right now, not bad at all.
BEAR20|Past five years down 40%.
NEUT21|You're looking at a 40% return if they return to their current or their previous value.
NEUT22|I only have one share in this.
NEUT23|But I've had it for a couple months now.
NEUT24|Come to return $33.
BULL25|Not bad.
BULL26|46% growth in my investment alone and I still think there's room to grow.
NEUT27|Arm, they just they do a good job.
BULL28|It's a good company.
NEUT29|Go ahead and look into it yourself.
BULL30|And as you can see, 70% still say by they did a lot better in the quarterly earnings than predicted.
NEUT31|And they're also a dividend stock legionnaire.
NEUT32|Everyone excellent stock to get into.
