NEUT0|"""We want to talk about something that is very important, especially to car lovers, and then it has to do with the IPO of Tesla."
NEUT1|Today is the 10 year anniversary, so Bill forgive me.
NEUT2|I gotta let Rick Newman have first dibs on this because he's a car nut.
NEUT3|So the question is what has Tesla accomplished into my mind?
NEUT4|This is a couple of things, so Tesla was not the first car company to develop electric vehicle technology.
NEUT5|General Motors develop this in the 1990s and Toyota came out with with the hybrids in the early 2000s.
NEUT6|That's partly electrification.
BULL7|Tesla got all the big players attention, though, when it proved that it could actually sell electric only cars.
NEUT8|As a startup.
NEUT9|I interviewed the Vice Chairman of General Motors, probably back.
NEUT10|2008 or 2009 and he told me they were looking at this little startup in California and Santa themselves.
BULL11|Wow, if these guys can launch a car, we certainly ought to be able to do it so they get credit for pushing the big automakers in that direction.
NEUT12|And then I think, put aside for a minute self driving cars.
NEUT13|The other thing I think Tesla has done that's truly revolutionary is the over the air software updates.
NEUT14|The way you get your the way your phone gets updated so you cannot still cut.
NEUT15|Cannot do that in most other cars.
NEUT16|If there's a software.
NEUT17|Our issue, or just the new version of the software you have to go to the dealership.
NEUT18|I had to do this recently with my Subaru and I'm thinking to myself why am I going to the dealership to get a new software update?
NEUT19|Why can't they just beam this to me the way Tesla does?
NEUT20|So I think all the automakers will be doing that eventually.
NEUT21|And Tesla's, the one that is pushing them to do it.
NEUT22|There is definitely a lot of drama going on with Tesla, Elon Musk and we cover every single instance of it at Yahoo Finance.
NEUT23|But you really have to celebrate the fact that you know the IPO.
BULL24|10 years ago, the value of their stock has blossomed since then, second largest car maker by market cap.
NEUT25|They sort out when the IPO that 17 bucks a share.
NEUT26|It's now about 967 bucks a share and also just the story.
NEUT27|The progression of the company they started out in Fremont, CA.
NEUT28|He bought an old plant.
NEUT29|Transformed it became a headquarters.
NEUT30|Now they have a headquarters.
NEUT31|Another plant near Shanghai.
NEUT32|Plus they're building another one near Berlin, so just a tremendous story about and also the fact that he's pushed electric cars at the forefront of other automakers who are reluctant to even approach that yeah, and I'll tell you, I'm one of the people who thinks Tesla's valuation is crazy because they just don't have the scale about of all the big automakers and all the automakers have this technology at this point.
NEUT33|Tesla is ahead on some things, but not on everything, and it's behind on some things.
NEUT34|So Tesla as it builds out, Tesla has to hit.
NEUT35|They have to be able to capture the mass market.
NEUT36|They're getting there with the Model 3, which is cheaper than the Model S, but still around $50,000 for most buyers will see what happens when they try to claim turf in pickup trucks real SUV's.
BULL37|And if they can ever get down to vehicles for 25 or 30,000, the most ordinary people can buy if they can crack that market, that's great, but I think the company is overvalued at this point, but that doesn't take away from what they've accomplished.
NEUT38|It's extraordinarily hard to build cars.
BULL39|And especially to make up ago make ago of a company competing with all the companies that have been out there for 100 years.
NEUT40|Alright, Rick Newman sabeel.
NEUT41|We're going to leave Tesla there, although nobody will ever top there launching one of their roadsters into space.
NEUT42|It's actually on Musk's Roadster when they did that.
