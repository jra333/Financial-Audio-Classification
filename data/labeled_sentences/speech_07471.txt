NEUT0|"""Hi, in this video chart on ticker symbol UXIN, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, quite the eventful day in this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level musically would make this chart look the absolute best.
NEUT7|Going forward and moving in the next.
NEUT8|We can remember the markets are closed tomorrow on Friday for Good Friday, so friendly reminder, but would be $1.70.
BULL9|Meaning if the price could say above $1.70, that would be a very very impressive sign of strength.
NEUT10|Now if the price drops below Dollar 70.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage step above that level.
BULL12|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword definitely moving understand the price is way up here.
NEUT17|This line is way down here, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT18|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT19|As long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT20|As the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls and full health, the Bulls are in full health or control.
NEUT21|However, you must visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT22|Yeah, stand above $1.70 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT23|Gotta squeeze things down here quite a bit just to offer a perspective to show you that it's basically a Blue Sky breakout at this point as I continue to squeeze things down.
NEUT24|In fact, let's just do this out of curiosity.
NEUT25|Now, let's go to the daily time frame here.
NEUT26|And you can see that we're still even on the daily timeframe.
NEUT27|Heaven will go way back on the charts history, but looking at the daily next key overarching level to keep a close eye on going to be right up there at $2.25 and then after 2:25 next key level after that right up there, around $2.50.
NEUT28|So two 25250 next couple of key battlegrounds moving forward.
NEUT29|But on all absolutely monster volume.
NEUT30|So let's see how this one continues to play out next week.
NEUT31|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT33|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT34|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR39|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
