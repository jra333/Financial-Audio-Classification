BULL0|"""Add to this morning's fabulous vaccine news from Pfizer and Biontech."
BULL1|Rocket stocks to record highs while the stay at Home Economy place.
BEAR2|Last week slammed head first into a concrete retaining wall.
BEAR3|Even as the rest of the market caught fire, although Boyle tell you something by the end of the day, the ones that were the NASDAQ was crushing the listed stocks, also known as the Dow Jones.
BEAR4|Look, I think many of the top Covin 19 winners could have even more short term downside.
NEUT5|Alright, you hear that because I know a lot of you have asked me that on Twitter 'cause the very real prospect of an effective vaccine, one.
NEUT6|It's 90% when we're hoping 5060 like a flu.
BEAR7|That is a huge deal was a shocker.
NEUT8|However, it's going to take time to produce.
NEUT9|It's going to take time to distribute.
NEUT10|You can't just roll it out overnight, so we're stuck with the stay at home economy.
NEUT11|For the moment.
NEUT12|I know it's just for the moment, but that will matter.
NEUT13|More importantly, even once everybody's fascinated, some of the changes from the last eight months could be.
NEUT14|A lot more permanent than others, and we're going to highlight them all week 'cause I know you want to know which ones need to be sold, which can be kept.
NEUT15|So let's take cord cutting.
NEUT16|Now last week got a pair blowout quarters from Roku in the Trade desk, who my favorite cord cutting places, you know.
NEUT17|Rochas Technology is the preferred way to stream video from the Internet directly to your TV.
NEUT18|Not going away, people.
NEUT19|The trade desk is a digital advertising firm that specializes in video.
BEAR20|Oh boy, they got crushed today.
BEAR21|Roku tumbling more than 12% trade desk 47% after great quarter last week.
NEUT22|But I gotta admit they were due for some profiting.
BULL23|Despite today's slacking, Roku's still up 10% from November trade, this is up more than 30%.
NEUT24|Not over the last year, none of the past six months over the last six trading days last week, I told you away from pull back.
NEUT25|And that's what we're getting.
NEUT26|I think you should buy them into gradually into the weakest and not aggressively at all.
NEUT27|Then why bother?
NEUT28|Why bother?
NEUT29|Even with my look at him, why not dump all the state home place now that we have workable covid vaccine?
NEUT30|Well, because cord cutting is a powerful long term themes and that's what we call a secular trend.
NEUT31|OK, always people there cyclical and there's secular meaning it doesn't need the economy to do well.
BEAR32|People were dumping their cable subscriptions for web based video services long before the pandemic.
BULL33|In other words, cover is not giving these companies temporary boosts.
NEUT34|See they were already headed in the right direction.
NEUT35|The virus simply stepped on the accelerator.
BEAR36|The workers aren't going to go back once they get vaccinated.
