NEUT0|"""You think the next four years could be fairly positive?"
NEUT1|Can you talk about why?
NEUT2|Sure I do.
BULL3|I think what Covid is done in the pandemic is done is actually enhanced.
NEUT4|The installed base of Apple, specifically through its tablets and through its Max.
NEUT5|As people learn from home and work from home.
BULL6|In the case of Amazon, I think we've seen an acceleration by two years of adoption of E Commerce and out of bricks and mortar, and that that usage that consumer usage in new forms gets more and more cemented.
BEAR7|The long like these covid lockdowns persist on the social side.
NEUT8|I agree with Julia that Google and Facebook are which is Google.
BEAR9|YouTube are better off after elections because a lot of the scrutiny on them for election fraud lifts after the election.
BEAR10|So I think they will be less in the spotlight post election than they were last week.
NEUT11|Chris, I wonder to what degree do you agree?
NEUT12|What happens?
NEUT13|I mean, why are they no longer?
NEUT14|Would they be in the crosshairs?
NEUT15|Still, if there were the change administration and with the vaccine if work from home were to dissipate, largely, does that not leave these names liable somehow?
NEUT16|Sure, car leaves the name somewhat liable.
NEUT17|I mean, in our general views and aspects, in a bubble is a fed fuel bubble and you know bubbles need fuel to keep moving along and building and higher and higher.
NEUT18|And I think the next stage of the bubble.
NEUT19|Once the market gets through the election is going to be the Fed is going to come back into focus and be a lot more vocal about monetizing the deficits and the stimulus that we do and that favors some of these Internet and says software stocks over the coming years.
NEUT20|I think the big next leg of the bubble.
NEUT21|Will be M&A activity aggressively.
BULL22|Picking up once we get through the vaccine.
NEUT23|Once we're on this path renormalization.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
