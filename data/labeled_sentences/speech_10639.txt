BEAR0|"""We are now in the grips of an inflation scare that is put a chokehold on the growth stocks and it's been a nightmare for TAC."
BEAR1|This morning I felt like we have still get another ugly session for tech.
NEUT2|Then we got this reprieve when interest rates took a breather for an ugly clothes.
BEAR3|With the Dow only finishing down 470 points as in Peter climbing .48%, NASDAQ did manage to rebound .56% and that is important.
BEAR4|Not not everything can rally when rates tumble like today, the big industrials lose their momentum, hence the decline of doubt.
NEUT5|But at least the cloud.
NEUT6|This semis.
NEUT7|The cyber security stocks who climb out of the hole that during and leave the nastec into a rare Patch of green, in other words.
BULL8|We rolled back the reflation trade for another day, however, after crazy year full of unprecedented action, we're finally dealing with something normal here.
NEUT9|I've gone over the last half dozen of these inflation scarce, and I think the closest analogue is the one we got from December 2015 through February 2016.
NEUT10|Back then, the economy was heating up, our economy is heating up.
NEUT11|Our previous Fed chief, now Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, let us know that it was time economy was too strong, had to raise rates, had to raise the federal funds rate, then is now the most highly valued stocks, the ones that trade on their sales, not on there.
BEAR12|Earnings got absolutely annihilate it for weeks on end.
NEUT13|Emphasis on weeks and remember we're only likely to.
NEUT14|Of course, there's a big difference.
NEUT15|Our current Fed Chief Jay Palace decided to up in more than 40 years of monetary policy.
NEUT16|Ever since the late 70s, the Fed has been ruthless about crushing inflation, even if they have to cause the occasional recession in the process.
BEAR17|But Jay Pal believes we're underestimating the risks of high unemployment and overestimating the risks of inflation.
NEUT18|That was true even before the pandemic, and it's doubly true now to a lot of people on Wall Street.
BEAR19|So that's just heresy.
NEUT20|They don't trust the man, so you got bond sellers all over the place, betting that Powell had to change his mind because the economy is going to get strong as they see it.
BULL21|We're bout to get a huge stimulus package that will hit right as America reopens for business.
BEAR22|'cause of the vaccines so they think the economy must overheat.
BEAR23|Therefore we must have inflation, serious inflation and inflation is a nightmare for people who own bonds.
NEUT24|I mean, who wants a piece of paper that says 1.5% and inflation could break 2%?
BEAR25|You're losing every day and that's why these people been dumping bonds and their wholesale selling.
NEUT26|Always smashes the stock market.
NEUT27|Remember stocks are valued based on their future earnings streams and inflation erodes the value of these future earnings.
