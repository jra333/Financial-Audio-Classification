NEUT0|"""Let's take them one by one, starting with the daily chart of Amazon."
NEUT1|See the red line at the bottom here.
NEUT2|That's the seasonal pattern.
BEAR3|The way Amazon tends to trade at this time of year, Williams points out that historically, the period from September through late November has not been friendly for Amazon.
NEUT4|Well, is not been the case.
NEUT5|The exactly like this now.
NEUT6|And everyones Freddie and giving up on it.
NEUT7|Amazon will hold it.
BULL8|It's been able to rally in spite of the week seasonal pattern.
NEUT9|Didn't go all the way down, so you gotta imagine what happens when this pattern turns positive later in the week.
BULL10|I think it's going to be pretty amazing.
NEUT11|Next up, there's Walmart, the number two player in the E Commerce space.
NEUT12|Here's a company that's been making a fortune thanks to the pandemic.
BEAR13|Not only is Walmart and essential retailer mean they'll get a ton of business of covid cases, keep spiking, and governors are forced to shut down stores or do something to alleviate this incredible pressure.
BULL14|Walmart gets to stay open no matter what, which is why the stock was such a great performer during the first wave in the spring.
NEUT15|On top of that, the company spent billions building up its digital business.
NEUT16|Over the years there are great omnichannel operator now.
NEUT17|So what is this charge?
NEUT18|Kelly?
NEUT19|Well, the stock is routed in tandem with a strong seasonal pattern.
BULL20|Although even when the seasonals turned negative through July through September, Walmart kept climbing higher waves.
BEAR21|The seasonal forecast levels off for the next few months.
NEUT22|Normally one marks not to go to play on the Holidays, but I'm betting this year could be different.
BULL23|As far as the chart goes, the stock rallied when the seasons were bad.
BULL24|It rallied when the seasons were good.
NEUT25|I bet it keeps rolling when the seasons are just OK.
NEUT26|I know we should probably sub target for that, but we're going to use Larry cases large bins so right and I talked about target at the top of the show.
NEUT27|How about the daily chart of another one that's suddenly fallen out of favor?
NEUT28|Apple?
NEUT29|Well, this was a ton of its own merchandise online these days, apples.
NEUT30|More about the booming service revenue stream, though all the money they make selling you backup data, music descriptions and 30% cut, they take for the app stores then it is about hardware.
NEUT31|Remember the the smaller developers under million are getting a break in that App Store for cut in half.
BEAR32|This year most consumers are flush because so many of the things we normally spend money on have been shut down.
NEUT33|It's not an experiential economy anymore if you're not going to vacation, go out to dinner, go to the movies were going to bowl game.
BULL34|The savings really do add up.
NEUT35|That leaves you with a lot of extra cash so you can only really spend on stuff and Apple makes some of the best stuff in the universe.
NEUT36|Now history doesn't give us a ton of guidance here, right?
NEUT37|Apple?
BEAR38|Seasonal pattern is pretty much flat for the next few months, meaning it could go either way.
NEUT39|But between the air pods, the watch, the new 5G enabled iPhone.
NEUT40|12 I'm willing to bet that Apple is a huge holiday season.
NEUT41|Still, you know, my view on this one.
BULL42|Apples are great long term story, especially with the more China friendly Biden administration taking office in January.
NEUT43|So there's no need to get cute here.
NEUT44|Just own it.
NEUT45|Don't trade it as always.
NEUT46|And how do I know about Biden?
NEUT47|Biden is 18 player teamed with the rest of our allies.
NEUT48|He doesn't want to go it alone, so I think that the Chinese would respect that.
NEUT49|Like it or not.
NEUT50|OK, now how about Home Depot?
NEUT51|When you look at Williams, a seasonal pattern here, it's a lot more cut.
BULL52|Home Depot's had a fabulous year because when millions of people are stuck at home.
NEUT53|They have every reason to renovate.
NEUT54|It's the only way to stay sane.
NEUT55|Frankly, we're doing it.
NEUT56|I mean, I told my wife is what's the matter with cesium?
NEUT57|What's matter with my daughters?
NEUT58|Don't cabbage, she's older.
NEUT59|We gotta get rid of.
NEUT60|We have to renovate.
NEUT61|And you know, we had to.
NEUT62|I guess we have to more important.
NEUT63|The seasonal forecast suggests that the stocks do for big Run.
NEUT64|Jacqueline Williams tells us that retail tends to catch fire.
