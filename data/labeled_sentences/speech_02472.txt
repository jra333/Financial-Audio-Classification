NEUT0|"""Alright, so Disney is at $187.67 with a market cap of 340.48 billion and we had a nice run up so a month ago we were at around 170 and then we hit around 190 and that's due to Disney releasing their earnings report an anytime they do this."
NEUT1|Disney shoots up and now we're starting to see the sell off so let's take a look at what I believe was the most important part of their earnings report.
NEUT2|And that is this.
BULL3|Disney smashed subscriber expectations Thursday when it reported bringing in nearly 95 million paid subscribers to Disney.
NEUT4|Plus across the other platforms, including Hulu, ESPN, the number of subscribers came in at 146,000,000.
BEAR5|That is an insane number.
NEUT6|That is why Disney keeps raging like we.
BULL7|We've seen quite a bit of movement in Disney.
NEUT8|We just keep creeping up slowly an this is.
BULL9|This is amazing.
NEUT10|This is why hold Disney because of the Disney plus slip slash subscriber platform that they have and I believe that once they beat Netflix is subscriber count which is around 190,000,000.
BULL11|I think we're going to see money flow out of Netflix and into Disney.
NEUT12|That would be the ideal scenario, but that's.
BULL13|That's my hope, and I think we are just going to keep going up.
NEUT14|Eventually.
BULL15|We're going to hit the $200 range.
NEUT16|That'll be our, you know, steady line.
NEUT17|Then we'll hit the next notch, which will be like 220 and we'll just keep going up slowly but surely in my opinion.
NEUT18|So stay on top of this.
NEUT19|Do your own research.
NEUT20|Have some fun, make some money.
