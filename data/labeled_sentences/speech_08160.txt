BEAR2|As you can see it on Coca Cola stock graph and we're looking at wireless stock is tanked in the first bit of 2021.
BEAR3|If you go back to the end of 2020 we can see the stock ended the year trading at almost 55 U.S. dollars, but since then it has dropped almost 11%.
BEAR4|This is a bit better than the end of January to where the stock was down 12.2% compared to the S&P 500.
BEAR5|That was down only percent in January.
NEUT6|So why is this?
BEAR7|Well, Coca Cola also had a terrible 2020 and if we go look at their stock graph for the last year, we can see that it began 2020 training that almost 60 U.S. dollars.
BEAR8|However, it took a massive drop dropping down to about 37 U.S. dollars in March 2020.
NEUT9|But we know this is because the coronavirus pandemic, most SMB 500 stocks did this.
BEAR10|Coca Cola didn't recover and through the whole year it was down from its $60.00 high at the beginning of the year and in the year.
BULL11|However, only $5 off the beginning of the year.
BEAR12|While the S&P 500 was up nearly 10% in 2020, so why is this while Coca Cola has been here especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with them having to implement strict social distancing measures in the EU and USA factories, this is hammered their production rates and as a result reduced their revenue as well as this Coca Cola haven't been able to sell as many drinks they normally would.
NEUT13|A lot of Coca Cola's drinks, including their water brands like to Sarnia, sold at theme Parks, music, concerts, bars and restaurants.
NEUT14|And as these haven't been open worldwide, there hasn't been as many sales for the company.
BEAR15|This is hampers Coca Cola's revenue, and it's expected that the Q4 performance is going to be 5% down on the previous time in 2019.
NEUT16|So Coke isn't having a great time here.
BULL17|However, I do think Coca Cola will recover as their issues look to be resolved when the coronavirus pandemic ends.
NEUT18|It doesn't look like there's some systemic issue in the company, it just looks like they're not even a great time during the pandemic.
NEUT19|So I do believe keeping on Coca Cola.
BEAR20|If they do drop a little bit, then maybe it's a buy.
NEUT21|But I'd say stay away at the moment.
NEUT22|Don't forget though, I'm not a financial advisor to make your own decisions when trading, and that's it for today's video.
