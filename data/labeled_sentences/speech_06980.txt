BULL0|"""Hello and welcome to another foolish investing video from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I'm not Rogers, I'm joined today by Nathan Parmley, the lead advisor for Champions Pro pay Nathan America.
NEUT2|Great to be here so today I want to talk about a company that is making the news a lot recently, but maybe isn't one that everyone will Hurd of companies quindell anything.
NEUT3|Could you tell us a bit about what Quinn Deltas?
NEUT4|Sure mark.
NEUT5|Basically there are business process outsourcing company which means other companies use them so they don't have to do some work internally.
NEUT6|A lot of the work that they do is focused on insurance claims and they have a lot of software and consulting services that they offer around that.
NEUT7|That sounds like quite a quite a few things going on there, but the country the company's origins were slightly odd.
NEUT8|They used to be a Country Club, right?
BULL9|Yeah, I believe so.
NEUT10|I actually, I didn't dig that far back.
NEUT11|I've tried to stay just in the last two years or recent history of the business.
NEUT12|Yeah, OK, well, the big question I guess is would you ever invest personally in window?
NEUT13|We had a member in Championship Pro ask us a little over a year about this company, so I took a look at that time and recently again and I see the same issue with the company.
BEAR14|Now that I saw a year ago and it's why I wouldn't ultimately invest in the company, they really have an issue with cash flow.
NEUT15|They're doing a lot of acquisitions, they spend a lot of money on working capital and they're continually having to go back to the market to raise additional capital to support what they're doing.
NEUT16|But as they pour more money into the business, there's there's no sign that they're actually generating more cash from all this activity.
NEUT17|OK, so they have it guys Quidel maybe not on Nathans watch list at the moment too.
NEUT18|"Next time full on."""
