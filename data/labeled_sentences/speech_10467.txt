NEUT0|"""How about Tesla?"
NEUT1|Much tougher for years I called Tesla called stock that I could make a judgment on.
NEUT2|Then I have what you might call religious conversion after series of events, everything from seeing my wife and daughter happily behind the wheel, loving it to the balance sheet going from worst to first.
NEUT3|Got me to recommend the stock at $260.00.
NEUT4|Of course, at the time I was attacked as a Johnny come lately, but if you listen to me last, remember, you're now up to 1700 points.
NEUT5|Call me anything you want, but don't call me late for dinner.
NEUT6|Still should've core company be worth nearly 400 billion.
NEUT7|Of course.
NEUT8|God then again Teslas.
NEUT9|Not a car company's technology company.
NEUT10|Just like this fear in $13 billion.
NEUT11|NVIDIA or the seven $70 billion Facebook card.
NEUT12|Simply one manifestation.
NEUT13|The truck will be another the solar business, the 3rd and finally the battery business could end up being the most important piece of the puzzle.
NEUT14|I think we'll take it far more seriously when Tesla holds its battery dance.
NEUT15|Remember, 22nd, and that's when you might see the battery that can go for ages without charging with Elon Musk, who knows?
NEUT16|Belk.
BEAR17|I know the Bears think it's ridiculous that a car company with a couple of factors in US, another in China turned away in Berlin.
NEUT18|Command such a gigantic market capitalization.
NEUT19|Famous saying that forever again though, if you look at Tesla as a tech company, that just so happens to make cars, well, the valuation can make more sense, can we?
NEUT20|What I'd be a buyer?
NEUT21|Pier 2000 Bullets run a lot.
BULL22|I think it's got some vulnerability to after this might give us a move but the company could have $3535 of earnings power in 2025, according to today's report from Solomon.
NEUT23|Also Wedbush, so it's not insane to pay 40 or 50 times that number given the spectacular growth rate.
NEUT24|And that's how people determine stock prices.
NEUT25|Not whether it's worth more or less than Toyota or Ford.
NEUT26|Full disclosure, my Chapel Trust is a very big position Apple, but we've already told members of the action alerts plus.com club that will keep on you and we're not going to trade it.
NEUT27|As for Tesla, I fear that Battery Day might be somewhat down, but you got my bus and buy it in any split related weakness next week.
NEUT28|Then you can ring the register and part of your position before battery damn September 22nd, just in case that whatever you wanna have some long term now even after 1700 point game, I know.
NEUT29|Must Scott more magic in the in the tank.
