BEAR1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, Nile haters will be poor.
NEUT2|Let's get started.
NEUT3|Recently.
BEAR4|There have been many Nile haters commenting on my videos that my Nile stock price predictions are too high.
NEUT5|I disagree with this because the electric vehicle manufacturer Neo is a leader in electric vehicles.
BEAR6|My hate comments on Neo are bull crap.
BULL7|Now is, according to analysts, their best electric vehicles stock to purchase.
NEUT8|And in this video we will explain why Annihilators will be poor.
BULL9|First of all, Nios delivery numbers are growing at a higher percentage than Tesla.
BEAR10|This completely proves Neo haters are wrong and now just needs to keep increasing their delivery numbers at this percentage every month.
BULL11|If Neo can achieve this, it will turn its investors rich.
BULL12|Just last month, Nio produced record breaking deliveries with over 7000 of them in December.
NEUT13|Second, China likes Neo over Tesla.
NEUT14|According to trusted analyst surveys, Neo car purchasers are more likely to recommend their product than Tesla.
NEUT15|Second part of this is the Chinese government will never allow Iota fail.
NEUT16|They invested a lot of money in the electric vehicle manufacturer and they can't afford Neo to fail.
NEUT17|Next, we have an obvious point on how electric vehicles will take over the world by 2030.
NEUT18|Analysts say that by 2030 at least, 50% of electric vehicles worldwide will be electric.
NEUT19|Even more will be in China and there not after up to 50% of the whole electric vehicle market.
BULL20|Last but not least, NIO is expanding to Europe and to be exact they are expanding to Norway.
NEUT21|There have been linked job interviews on LinkedIn proving that Neo is starting a factory there.
NEUT22|But you might be working.
NEUT23|Whine IO will go to Norway.
BULL24|Neo will go to Norway first because it is the only country in the world where over 50% of all vehicles are electric NIO Founder, CEO and Chairman William Lee also said in an interview that Europe is more friendly to electric vehicles.
BULL25|Now because of this and the financials, Neo will become an electric vehicle winner.
BEAR26|Analysts say that Neo haters will be poor.
BULL27|They proved this with the fast that Neo is expected to grow to as much as possibly $300 per share this year.
BEAR28|However, now bears that leave hate comments will have money in their bank and they will lose all of it over inflation.
NEUT29|Now what you have all been waiting for?
NEUT30|Let's compare how much Nile Bulls will have in five years and how much Nile haters will have.
NEUT31|Let's say both of them have $100,000.
NEUT32|Nail build invested in Niles stock today and waits for five years, let's say as a conservative estimate that Neo will grow by only 100% per year for the next five years.
NEUT33|After five years, Neo Bulls will have over $3 million.
NEUT34|However, looking at past inflation is $100,000.
NEUT35|Will in five years be worth at most $90,000?
NEUT36|This proves Niall Bulls will be rich and haters of Neo will be poor.
BULL37|Hold long and strong blue skies are coming.
BULL38|Thanks for watching.
