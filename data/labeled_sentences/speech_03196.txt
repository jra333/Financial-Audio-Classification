BULL0|"""Now on to the final trader talk of the day we saved the best for last year's Doctor Jay with his stock of the day."
NEUT1|Hello and good morning for business.
NEUT2|First am I am John Najarian and I thought we'd talk a little bit about the Peter Lynch theory.
NEUT3|Now if you don't know him, he's of course the legendary money manager for Fidelity, and Peter Lynch always said invest in what you know.
NEUT4|In other words, if it was a mom and she was going to the supermarket and she was buying a lot of General Mills products.
NEUT5|Maybe she wanted to buy some General Mills stock.
NEUT6|The same applies during this COVID-19 shutter in place order that we are all living through right now.
NEUT7|What are we all doing?
NEUT8|We're spending a lot more time online and we're spending a lot more time watching streaming media.
BULL9|The big winner here has been Netflix NFLX.
NEUT10|Why's that well number one?
NEUT11|They already had a huge base.
NEUT12|100,000,000 people already had Netflix.
BULL13|Before this got started and they are growing at 100% in just a two week.
NEUT14|Can you imagine that if you go from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000 unique users hitting your site, that's what Netflix did folks.
BULL15|That's why the stock jumped from $350.00 to $450 in four trading days.
NEUT16|So Peter Lynch theory if you're watching a lot of Netflix, maybe you want to own some of that stock.
NEUT17|I am John Najarian from business, first am from our business.
NEUT18|First AM check it out on social media.
NEUT19|"We're on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter and go to businessfirstam.com for where to see our show on TV."""
