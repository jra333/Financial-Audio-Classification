NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol you see, oh, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Did this analysis on Thursday, so let us where the green line here is coming from and then the red line right there an updates.
NEUT4|Probably not the right word.
NEUT5|Confirmation would be more of an accurate term and we definitely have a very very interesting setup here headed into next week.
NEUT6|So the first bit of confirmation would be in regards to this green line here, which again this will mean a little bit more of those you that watch video from Thursday.
NEUT7|But even if you did it on Thursdays video, I talked about $1.50, four being a key level of support and you can see that with the pullback that occurred today.
NEUT8|It found some surprise, surprise support right there at $1.54, so the power of charts and why.
NEUT9|Firmly believe now.
NEUT10|Charge perfect.
NEUT11|No, nothing's perfect, but should you?
NEUT12|At least you know, learn charts.
NEUT13|Should you at least have a man?
NEUT14|Your trader tool belt?
NEUT15|Absolutely in.
BULL16|Here is a great example of it, but point here being that as far as supports are concerned, Dollar 54 still remains very important and it did indeed hold as support here.
NEUT17|Now why is that level so important?
NEUT18|I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole for time sake, but if you're interested you can just go watch a video from April 16th.
NEUT19|That I did an I talk about.
NEUT20|You know why that level is so important, but the idea here is that it's important and it did ultimately hold as the day or on the day.
NEUT21|Now.
NEUT22|On the flip side, what's very interesting is yesterday's video.
NEUT23|I drew this red line.
NEUT24|And you can see that this trend line played a vital role this morning.
BEAR25|The price actually try to make move upwards and once again the power of charts right there price got rejected.
NEUT26|But the most interesting thing is look at this.
BULL27|Assuming there's no gap downs, the price is very, very close to potentially getting a break out of that red line.
NEUT28|Now just because it's close, does that mean it's guaranteed to happen?
NEUT29|Of course not.
NEUT30|No such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT31|My point is, it's at least the rational thought to have that you know what.
NEUT32|Maybe that.
BULL33|Maybe things are prepping for a potential break to the upside that can gather that much more momentum so.
NEUT34|We'll see what happens with the next week, but there's definitely some very interesting dynamics here.
NEUT35|From the technical point of view going on, so we'll see what happens with that.
NEUT36|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT38|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL39|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you.
NEUT46|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT47|That is again totally live.
NEUT48|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT49|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT50|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT51|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
