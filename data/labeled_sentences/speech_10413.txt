BEAR0|"""How ugly could this one get?"
NEUT1|As long as Caterpillar can hold above 130 something I don't think is that likely, but at the end the week constant should be in the clear, but the stock gives you a weekly close below 130 and close at 120 nineteen, and he says his dog has serious teeth.
BEAR2|Where Wildcats had a bad year so far in 2020, the full stochastic oscillator still hasn't reached oversold territory.
NEUT3|Again, my theme?
NEUT4|OK, we're not oversold yet.
NEUT5|It's got a slowing slowly descending down slope.
NEUT6|That's not a good sign, but the heart of the bear thesis lies in the price action.
BEAR7|If Caterpillar doesn't get any bounce from these levels, then it's ten week.
BEAR8|Moving average will be on track to close below the 21 week moving average.
NEUT9|When that same crossover happened last summer, this stock got pulverized.
BEAR10|It's going to be worse this time, I think.
BEAR11|Even worse, if Cat closes below 1:30 on Friday, that will trigger a bearish head and shoulders pattern in boys that ever the most reliably negative patterns out there.
BEAR12|Based on that head and shoulders cause believes that this stock could fall another 10%.
NEUT13|Please levels below 130.
NEUT14|The Bears are firmly in control.
BEAR15|This one caterpillars three days to rebound back above that level, or it is in real trouble is bottom on this markets been put through the meat grinder, but the charts of Intel and Caterpillar as interpreted by Tim Collins suggested some major stocks could still have a lot more downside.
NEUT16|He, and so many others we could have done were not oversold enough yet people were not.
