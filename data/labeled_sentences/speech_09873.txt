NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on that video?
NEUT2|Today it is.
NEUT3|Your boy will in this video it will be about GameStop stock ticker symbol G me, OK?
NEUT4|Now in this video I'm going over a key level that I want to buy it, but we did get shares today.
NEUT5|So if you're going to score croup, you know we got shares today.
NEUT6|It was more of a Yolo play just in case for earnings.
NEUT7|That is today after hours so we don't know right this time can go up or down.
NEUT8|But I do think the stock will be crazy tomorrow.
BULL9|OK, it will all be off earnings so hopefully the shares that we got would do good and it will go up on the upside.
BEAR10|But if it does go down on the downside.
NEUT11|Then that's why we didn't really put more than 1% of our portfolio in.
NEUT12|So I'll go over those key levels right now.
NEUT13|Makes you guys smash that like button.
NEUT14|Turn those post on vacations and subscribe.
NEUT15|Subscribe.
NEUT16|Subscribe now.
NEUT17|Resistance level.
NEUT18|You still want to have?
NEUT19|This is not changed at 232.60, so just in case we get that pop up it might run up all the way up to hear you know GMM can be very volatile like this.
NEUT20|Try not to get shares in here because because of selling pressure, you could probably get a shares off the selling pressure and then get shares when it falls and then go higher to a new resistance level around 270.
NEUT21|OK, so if it comes down here sells off right?
NEUT22|Maybe you get shares around that area and then you can exit around 270 which is about 20%.
NEUT23|But I'll go over that play after this.
BEAR24|See selling pressure.
NEUT25|OK so that is a future play that I have in mind but this needs to hit first and at first need to sell off.
NEUT26|And then I'll have that play OK, but for right now this level right here around 170.4 if it hits this level tomorrow.
NEUT27|I will be looking to get some more shares of Jimmy.
NEUT28|OK, I've been waiting for this level to hit is not hit yet.
BEAR29|It's been over a week but it has beginning close, but you've been seeing a lot of buying pressure from this level without it even hitting.
NEUT30|So I'm trying to see once it does hit I want to see some buying pressure OK, and once I see that buying pressure to confirm then I will get in sherzan.
NEUT31|I'll hold those shares.
NEUT32|Two extra prize.
NEUT33|Preferably it probably.
NEUT34|Let's see was 10%.
NEUT35|10% is 187.
NEUT36|So I probably hold this about 15%.
NEUT37|Two around at 200 level.
NEUT38|OK, so if I enter around here on 170 I probably holds around that 200 level and that's when I'll probably exit out shares OK.
NEUT39|So that's the type of play I'm looking forward.
NEUT40|Tomorrow I'm looking at this level and then I'm also waiting for this to hit sell off and then now be another play.
NEUT41|OK, so this was quick and easy.
NEUT42|Got straight to the point.
