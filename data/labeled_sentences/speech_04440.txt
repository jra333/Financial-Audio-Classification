BEAR0|"""As I said last night, these crazy moves smack of frothiness, meaning their parts of this market that are on the highway to the danger zone because Frost doesn't last."
NEUT1|I just want to get back to the house in days of the research revolution, so I'm gonna show how it can work, because maybe we've forgotten.
NEUT2|Let's start with the powerful observation you may have seen on Saturday night.
NEUT3|Lot about how Zillow has replaced more prurient behaviors because millennials want to search for homes.
NEUT4|It's hilarious skit.
NEUT5|There's a reason Zillow's always been known as House Point in the real estate industry.
NEUT6|But now, 15 years into existence, so it has gone to a whole new level.
NEUT7|This kit was amazing, hilarious, but if you were using the Peter Lynch method you could Godzilla head of one of the biggest part quarters of the year.
BULL8|The quarter the sent to stock up 17% today.
NEUT9|If you saw this kitten did the homework you have discovered that still is benefiting from what they called the great reshuffling people, leaving cities because of covid they've come up with new tools where you can literally sell your house on Zillow with a click, then fix it up and resell to someone they'll sell it.
NEUT10|Someone else you get to check you move whatever.
NEUT11|Listen to what CEO Richard Barton had to say on the conference call last night.
NEUT12|Customers want simplicity.
NEUT13|In one click, when it is something they don't care a ton about, they just need to get it done.
NEUT14|He goes on to cite the Amazon prime model is inspiration saying quote what people want to do is get into their new house.
NEUT15|Everything else is an obstacle.
NEUT16|Yes, he's talking one.
NEUT17|Click homebody you imagine.
NEUT18|Of course, many things can go wrong.
NEUT19|What if the housing market acts like we saw from 2007, 2009?
NEUT20|What happens then?
NEUT21|What if interest rates spike in the left holding the bag of your house making more expensive?
NEUT22|What happens if you can't get him, which isn't?
NEUT23|So taking a huge risk here, sure.
NEUT24|But you know what these are stocks is risky.
NEUT25|That's the nature of the game.
NEUT26|You probably won't want to nzila with the housing market slows down.
NEUT27|It sure isn't right now, but for the moment this is the hottest housing market in Asia.
BULL28|Is home values are appreciated.
BULL29|Double digits the feds telling us they're going to keep rates low in order to generate job growth.
NEUT30|To me it sounds like the perfect tone.
NEUT31|The Amazon of Housing in that silver.
