BEAR0|"""The hypothetical risk return profile for gold has turned conflicted."
NEUT1|According to analysis of CME Group market data.
NEUT2|The conflicted Cinnamond state is detecting the presence of two distinctly different potential scenarios being debated by market participants.
BULL3|Specifically, there is a positive scenario which we interpret as the potential for gold to rally if inflation were to return, and certainly we're seeing the inflation expectations embedded in the US Treasury inflation protected securities, AKA tips.
BULL4|The tips are starting to signal the probability of inflation heading above 2 1/2% in the years ahead.
BULL5|Rising inflation expectations reflect the economic optimism associated with the acceleration of vaccine distribution as well as the likely impact of the recent fiscal stimulus package on the US economy.
BEAR6|But the conflicted sentiment state also signals the presence of a competing and more negative scenario.
BEAR7|In this case, our interpretation is, the goal is suffering from the competition that has come from the rally in Bitcoin.
NEUT8|Now, while not always the case, a conflicted cinemat state often resolves within a month or two into a more typical balanced risk date.
NEUT9|Once one or the other scenario gains control of the market narrative.
NEUT10|A sentiment analysis does not predict which way the market might go.
NEUT11|It's just a risk metric based on market activity in terms of option prices, volumes, intraday Futures Trading ranges and the metrics suggests that we are entering a period when a sharp price move one way or the other might occur in this tug of war of different scenarios.
