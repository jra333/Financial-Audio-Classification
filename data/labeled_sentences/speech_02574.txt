BULL0|"""Welcome to FT markets."
NEUT1|For the traditional post, ECB conference analysis.
NEUT2|Speaking with me today is Ralph Atkins, the FT's capital market editor.
NEUT3|Now you know, gorgeous Nicosia, lots of questions about Greece, but really, the big news is about QE, which is starting on Monday, absolutely are hoping for some more details about actually how they're going to implement the program.
NEUT4|What we do know is they're going to start on Monday.
NEUT5|There going to be fairly flexible in how they go about it, but Mr. Dragon talks about being the determined implementation of his 60 billion a month purchases.
NEUT6|Now if we go to your first chart, we see that some of the effects of QE have already happened with Italian and Spanish.
BEAR7|10 year bond yields coming down really sharply over the last few months they have come down quite a lot already this year.
BEAR8|In anticipation of them starting and actually since the first conference, they've come down a little bit further.
NEUT9|The big question now is, of course whether they start going back up again on expectations of higher inflation and higher growth.
NEUT10|1 interesting detail from the press conference we got today was that, Draghi said.
NEUT11|They will not buy anything that's yielding less than minus, not .2%, which is where they had the interest rate on their deposit facility.
BEAR12|Of course, 10 year Italian and Spanish bonds are very low, but nowhere near that level.
BEAR13|But some bonds, including two year German bonds are actually below that level, so there is some limit to how much they gotta pay for bonds.
BEAR14|Now the other big news today was about the ECB on forecasts on where they see inflation, and they've downgraded the revision for this year down to 0.
NEUT15|Inflation, but they're very bullish about 2016.
NEUT16|They expect 1.5%.
BULL17|That's a jump of 1.5 percentage points, expecting that their program is going to work then it's going to boost inflation.
NEUT18|Consider you almost an back by 2017 back to within the below, but close to 2% target.
NEUT19|And as you can see, what we have here is this is what markets are pricing in for inflation.
BULL20|Five year inflation rate over five years starting in five years, and what we've seen even today is quite a sharp jump back up.
NEUT21|In what markets are expecting inflation rates to be so sons for now?
NEUT22|For now, as you say, the sun is shining on Mr. Draghi, but now the other questions about growth, which is what, certainly governments and lots of voters in the eurozone want to return and also an upward revision.
NEUT23|But a lot of it will depend on your next chart, which is what happens to the euro.
BULL24|Will this sharp depreciation against the dollar which we're seeing boost experts and really help too?
NEUT25|To drag, it argues it is already in that explained there more optimistic forecasts along with, of course a low oil price and also the effects of QE as well.
BULL26|He sees as boosting the eurozone economy, getting back to sort 2% growth by 27, which will be quite strong FI eurozone standards.
NEUT27|So in a way this could be really sees the Japan scenario as avoided at the moment because Q will work absolutely.
BULL28|Mr Draghi very confident today has to be really if QE is going to work alright.
BULL29|Thank you very much for being with us today.
BULL30|Mr Draghi is certainly very confident that QE is going to work.
NEUT31|"Only time will tell whether it is indeed right."""
