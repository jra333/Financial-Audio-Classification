BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about until today.
NEUT2|So what they do is they make processors.
NEUT3|They make other chips too, but it's many processors.
NEUT4|Their main earnings come from server processors, but you know they make things from well you would think tablet, but they're not really in the tablet market, but anything bigger than that they have product for.
NEUT5|They also do have products for the tablet.
NEUT6|Market for the tablet sector, but they they don't sell too well.
NEUT7|Current price $50 which gives the market cap of $213 billion dividend yield currently 2.62% with a payout ratio of 24%.
BULL8|Obviously not bad.
BULL9|Not bad at all.
NEUT10|Current revenue $72 billion.
BEAR11|Earnings of $21 billion and I just left it the same because the numbers were different but there was only $5 million separating them and that's very insignificant.
NEUT12|So just basically even PE of nine, which is again amazing forward P of 11.
BEAR13|Always a bad sign when the PE goes up.
NEUT14|But you know going from 9 to 11 is not terrible at all.
NEUT15|Total assets $137 billion.
NEUT16|Total liabilities $59 billion, which gives them total stockholders equity of $77.7 billion.
BULL17|And that is one of the nicest balance sheets that I've seen.
NEUT18|I've I've had one a couple days ago that was pretty decent, but.
BEAR19|Much lower numbers obviously, so overall for growth.
NEUT20|Investor Intel is really not the company for a huge growth, especially with market cap of $213 billion.
BEAR21|Really not going to see this 10X anytime soon, especially with the renewed competition that they have from AMD, so they're not in as greater position as they used to be, and somehow AMD is price actually exceeds.
NEUT22|Intel's at this point.
NEUT23|Very surprising that one.
NEUT24|I don't understand it either, but you know.
BEAR25|So revenue growing slightly not enough for a growth investor.
NEUT26|Obviously that's besides the 213 billion market cap for dividend investor.
NEUT27|I think this is a very solid stock, so definitely look into it.
BULL28|2.62% is reasonably low for a dividend stock, but payout ratio of 24 percent is obviously amazing.
BULL29|PE of Nine is obviously amazing.
BULL30|Balance sheet is also pretty amazing, so for dividend investor I think this is pretty good stock to even put a fairly large amount into for a value investor.
NEUT31|I think the the same goes.
BULL32|The P is amazing, the earnings growth revenue growth not quite there.
BULL33|Dividend is nice bonus and the balance sheet is pretty nice, so I think this is definitely a good stock to look into for a value investor, and I think this is a fairly stable stock and I can see them being around and with similar numbers in even a decade so.
NEUT34|Definitely recommend anyone to look into the stock.
NEUT35|Nothing for a growth investor, but everyone else probably finds this very interesting.
NEUT36|That's it for me.
NEUT37|For today.
