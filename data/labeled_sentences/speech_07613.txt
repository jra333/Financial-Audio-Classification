NEUT0|"""Lucas writes in he said, did Justin son change your mind on crypto currencies or anybody who doesn't know?"
NEUT1|Justin Son bought the dinner or the lunch that you just had from the last Glide Foundation fundraiser.
NEUT2|He is actively involved in Bitcoin.
NEUT3|After that meeting his PR people put out some notes saying that, you know you kind of listen to cryptocurrency and maybe you're a little more in tune with the idea of Bitcoin now.
NEUT4|Well, I would say this when Justin and four friends came, they behave perfectly and we had a good three and a half hour dinner and the whole thing.
NEUT5|Was a very friendly exchange of ideas, but.
NEUT6|Cryptocurrencies basically have no value and they don't produce anything, so you can look at your little Ledger item for the next 20 years and it says you've got Exodus cryptocurrency or that it doesn't reproduce it doesn't.
NEUT7|It doesn't deliver it, it can't Mail you a check, it can't do anything.
NEUT8|And what you hope is that somebody else comes along and pays you more money for it later on, But then that person's got the problem.
NEUT9|But in terms of value.
NEUT10|Zero, so it sounds like he did not change your puzzle, but I didn't change his either and I had a very pleasant dinner and those people were.
BULL11|They behave more than well, and they gave four points or Justin gave 4.6 million to Glidden.
BULL12|That will buy a lot of meals and provide a lot of beds for people in San Francisco.
BULL13|So I thank him.
NEUT14|He gave you some Bitcoin.
NEUT15|What's it feel like to be a Bitcoin?
NEUT16|I don't have any Bitcoin.
NEUT17|You don't know, OK?
NEUT18|Now you don't own Bitcoin.
NEUT19|I will know I do not own one.
NEUT20|I don't know any cryptocurrency, I never will and.
NEUT21|You know, in the end I may start a war and currency.
NEUT22|You know, maybe I can create one and I'll say there's only gonna be 21 million of Em.
NEUT23|And you could have a little Ledger sheet from him.
NEUT24|Everything that says you have it and and you're going to have it after I die.
NEUT25|And but you can't do anything with it except solid for somebody else.
NEUT26|And the interesting thing of course, is that.
NEUT27|Bitcoin's been out there a long time, and people talked about how it would be used and in various kinds of exchange, but none of our companies are doing business in in Bitcoin or anything.
NEUT28|Yeah.
NEUT29|Point has been used, I think to move around a fair amount of money illegally so the the people in countries where, yeah, so the logical move from the introduction of Bitcoin is to go short suitcases because the money that was taken in two cases from one country to another.
BEAR30|Suitcases are probably fall off in demand.
NEUT31|"I mean so you can look at that as the economic contribution of Bitcoin to the society is."""
