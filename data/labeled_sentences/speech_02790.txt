NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol ENZC."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well put in, not quite higher highs, but it definitely put in a higher low here, so technically speaking I guess it didn't complete everything that you would want to see when it comes to an uptrend, but overall still a very nice looking chart.
BULL5|So much so I'm going to just this newest level of support up to that level.
NEUT6|At $0.50 fifty cents now being the ideal level meter F If you would ask them what make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
BULL7|Well, ideally speaking up the price and say about $0.50, that would be a very impressive sign of power.
BEAR8|Now with that being said, don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 50, that does not mean that the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL9|We have the price, could manage the above that area that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT10|Taking a step back though and looking at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT11|As I've been talking about over the past videos but will also continue to talk about 'cause you know.
NEUT12|It just makes things the easiest is that purple line right there?
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Moving average.
NEUT15|So assuming you care about the big picture of things and just want to gauge the health of the overall move.
NEUT16|Just watch that Purple Line because that line is going to move itself higher and higher, hence its name moving average.
NEUT17|So when it comes to engaging the health of the overall price movement, as long as the price stays above that purple line as align itself moves higher and higher.
NEUT18|Then the Bulls are in full health.
BULL19|Bulls are in full control hardness.
NEUT20|Visualize that that is what has been represented again, you're saying about $0.50 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT21|They don't matter.
NEUT22|As I've said in the past and will continue to say what matters the most is what the price has been doing and continues to do and that's this right here.
NEUT23|Just chipping away and building those higher bases.
NEUT24|Or if you want envision those stair steps.
NEUT25|So in other words, along the stair steps continue to construct themselves in the upward direction.
NEUT26|Then, given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance, so folks and healthy consolidations folks on chipping away and build our bases and sit back.
NEUT27|And with the overall trend do its thing First off.
BULL28|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT30|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR36|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
