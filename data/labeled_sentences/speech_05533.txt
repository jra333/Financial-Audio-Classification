NEUT0|"""All everyone analytics age 9th of Feb 2021."
NEUT1|Time is 1:28 PM UK time.
BEAR2|So regarding the Amazon my last video I published on Amazon it was an uptrend trade setup which I ended up getting break even 'cause I bought the market somewhere around here market.
BEAR3|They came down and kicked me out up and down South.
NEUT4|What is happening?
NEUT5|It seems that the triangle is not over yet, but soon we should see the end of it, so there might be a possibility that we might even come down to touch the trend channel, but whatever happens if this level gets broken.
NEUT6|The D wave gets broken.
NEUT7|You can be the buyer.
NEUT8|34 three, two.
BEAR9|If this level gets broken, then I'm expecting the Amazon to go up.
NEUT10|So let me delete the old things and this will be the new trade.
NEUT11|Set up.
NEUT12|Your stop loss should be at the bottom here.
NEUT13|This should be there, stop loss.
NEUT14|This is the stop loss 3084.
BEAR15|This is the stop loss for Amazon as well.
BEAR16|If the market doesn't break this level and comes down and breaks 3084 then the wave count will change.
BULL17|"Thanks for watching and have a good day."""
