NEUT0|"""MOL operates a Simon Property Group Mail as well, possibly reportedly in talks with Amazon, to use the empty spaces that were once occupied by basically anchor tenants such as Sears, JCPenney, to use them for fulfillment centers."
NEUT1|According to Dow Jones, we could see also the big turned into big grocery stores as well.
NEUT2|This is a fascinating story Alex.
NEUT3|Basically, this is the shift writ large.
NEUT4|You're basically turning a bricks and mortar store into an online fulfillment center.
NEUT5|There's a number of implications.
NEUT6|Kind of.
NEUT7|Of this though, what does it do to local wages?
BEAR8|Because Amazon has a huge effect on local wages and does it just accelerate the process in terms of stores like this going out of business?
NEUT9|It could also change the property, sort of valuations quite quite dramatically out of thought as well 100%.
NEUT10|I mean, I think that the story too, is that we're still overmold like, no matter how many malls have closed up, we're still over malls, so we need to find something that really.
NEUT11|Overmold it's a thing.
NEUT12|Yeah, I mean, I can tell you we live in in different areas, like when you just go through a mall and literally it's just a target, and then you have.
NEUT13|At least, I mean three blocks of a mall that's just empty.
NEUT14|The idea was maybe you could do like experiential stuff with it, but that's kind of out the window because of covid.
NEUT15|You're not going to go to like a big gym or something now that has daycare because of it.
NEUT16|Also, I wonder how much of this is through the Amazon Walmart saying, like, how fast can you get something to my door?
NEUT17|And if you have fulfillment center, that's close.
NEUT18|Then that's how you get a leg up.
NEUT19|Walmart in some ways has a leg up 'cause they have physical stores close to you, and maybe this is Amazon's kind of solution to that.
NEUT20|Yeah, and that all makes sense.
NEUT21|And the other thing as well.
NEUT22|I coming from Europe, which we don't really have.
NEUT23|This phenomenon is that I guess most of these malls are operated by sort of operating near large scale roads, which is usually a pre sort of pre requirement for having these.
NEUT24|They call them sheds over here these big fulfillment centers.
NEUT25|There's a huge market and it's one of the only sort of place within the commercial property market that has been operating quite strongly, but they need to be big near sort of near big roads.
NEUT26|I guess some of these sites are as well true.
NEUT27|I mean literally there all over right off the highway 150%.
NEUT28|The questions you do them in the middle of Manhattan.
NEUT29|That'll be terrifying.
BEAR30|"Talk about the traffic build up."""
