NEUT0|"""Good evening I'm Dan Fitzpatrick."
NEUT1|Stock market mentor.com.
NEUT2|Before I get started here, just going to take a quick look at Netflix, I'm going to be trading live tomorrow morning for members.
NEUT3|This is something I've mentioned this before.
NEUT4|My goal on this is to certainly teach and show some some good day trading techniques that are low risk and high reward.
NEUT5|Starting with which stocks to trade.
NEUT6|But my main goal on these is to help you make some money like.
NEUT7|Let's make some money today, so anyway, hopefully if you remember you will.
NEUT8|You will show up.
NEUT9|It's all I was enjoying even though I have to get up hell of early.
NEUT10|But also, if you're not a member, if you sign up for a free trial then you can get in on that.
NEUT11|You can get in on that class.
NEUT12|I have to be as a trial member.
NEUT13|So anyway with Netflix.
NEUT14|So the company reported earnings right after the market yesterday and it was whipping all over the place.
NEUT15|First it sold off then.
NEUT16|Was actually up and then finally by this morning people figured it out.
NEUT17|That maybe they're not doing that great after all, so the stocks down what I would suggest doing is this.
NEUT18|I wouldn't really be watching the stock at the 200 day moving average right here.
NEUT19|I would be watching to see more how the stock trades at the 50 day moving average, because that's the real trend indicator that we're looking here.
BEAR20|You can see after this ultimate low we get higher lows here.
NEUT21|And then higher highs, higher lows, higher and so.
BEAR22|Right now this stock is close to the 50 day moving average, but it's still asked to pull back about 3% or so.
NEUT23|So what I would do stocks at 326 now I would look for 3:20, look for 320 before you even consider buying the stock, and even then you're really probably going to be a little bit early.
NEUT24|I will say this if the stock gets down to 320.
NEUT25|And holds there for a bit.
NEUT26|Then maybe if you're listening to this video Wednesday night, then maybe by Thursday afternoon might be something that you could buy.
NEUT27|You know tomorrow afternoon, maybe Friday or most likely even the 1st and next week, because when this stock pulls back like it did here, it kind of takes a couple days to gather to gather itself.
NEUT28|And what I think you don't want to do is expect this kind of move.
NEUT29|That's just not the way.
NEUT30|This stock should trade with this big sell off so near and in time, so let the stock kind of settle in a little bit and as long as it holds above 320 you're good on the uptrending stock and you just keep a fairly tight stop on this like that.
NEUT31|Alright, and that's how you can trade this stock.
NEUT32|It's not a super out performer with respect to the overall market, but a lot of times people just kind of get their stocks that they are their favourites and.
NEUT33|You can make a ton of money if you're just trading the swings correctly on this, so anyway, that's all I got to say about Netflix.
NEUT34|"Hope to see you tomorrow morning at 9:15 Eastern 615 Jan Pacific."""
