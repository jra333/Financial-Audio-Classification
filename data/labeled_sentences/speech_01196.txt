BULL0|"""Joe, this is pretty amazing."
NEUT1|The run that gold's been on and coronavirus is just the latest catalyst for the buying.
NEUT2|Will it stop anytime soon?
NEUT3|Market risk and uncertainty is a key factor when you look at the drivers of gold.
NEUT4|Strategically.
NEUT5|Economic expansion, an market risk and uncertainty are the long term drivers with the price of gold, our expectation is that on the long term you're going to continue to face one of those two factors.
NEUT6|When you look at the gold price and its trajectory, you're going to have shorter tactical drivers as well.
NEUT7|Opportunity cost and also momentum.
NEUT8|That's what we're feeling right now.
NEUT9|Two days of a down market, a day of market up in terms of the gold price, these are things that play on the short term in tactically longer term, we're going to find is those market risks, so we have a crisis today, which is coronavirus when that starts to settle down.
NEUT10|Don't forget we've got an election year.
BEAR11|We've got negative real rates in 90% of the developed markets, we've got geopolitical risks.
NEUT12|We've gotta China tariff deal that still needs dealing.
NEUT13|We've got Brexit.
NEUT14|These are all things that are out there that are going to continue to people thinking about.
NEUT15|What's on the risk horizon?
NEUT16|What's the next risk for me to be concerned about now?
NEUT17|There's no doubt.
NEUT18|I mean, first of all, you have an axe to grind.
NEUT19|We're at the World Gold Council.
NEUT20|We understand that take us through some of the risks that we have in the gold market right now.
BEAR21|It's been a very staggering run.
NEUT22|It can't keep going on that pace though.
NEUT23|To be seen as I've mentioned, everyone wants to know about gold.
NEUT24|When there are crises, so it becomes very popular and it becomes very much a topic for discussion around the coffee table in our living rooms and in the news.
NEUT25|But what people need to really focus are those key drivers of the gold market, demand and supply.
NEUT26|When you think about demand again, it is long term driven by economic expansion.
NEUT27|People get wealthy, they save money.
NEUT28|They invest in consumables as well as safe haven assets.
NEUT29|And they also worry about market risk and uncertainty.
NEUT30|A long term driver.
NEUT31|So thinking about gold.
NEUT32|That way those drivers is key and we've addressed this issue by rolling out a tool on our website.
