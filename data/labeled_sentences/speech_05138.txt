NEUT0|"""Welcome to Fortune tech debate where we debate the issues of the day in two minutes."
BEAR1|Today we're discussing Netflix stocks are down across the board on fears of a potential trade war.
BEAR2|And yet Netflix is crushing it.
NEUT3|Alex, what's the deal?
NEUT4|So I actually cancelled my Netflix subscription a few weeks ago and I think that I will not be alone.
NEUT5|Overtime, I think not just a cord cutter.
BEAR6|You're cutting the subscription.
NEUT7|I didn't find myself watching it enough.
NEUT8|Now there's a lot of addictive programming on Netflix.
BULL9|But I think that it will be incredibly competitive over time for more and more of those types of programs.
NEUT10|Because Disney's coming in with more things like that going to have its own streaming network in the not so distant future.
NEUT11|Probably priced below Netflix.
BULL12|You also have cable channels or cable production channels like AMC looking to have better distribution across multiple platforms.
NEUT13|Nobody wants to be tide into Netflix.
NEUT14|That makes Netflix more and more of a hit driven business.
NEUT15|And if it's a hit driven business, those always have ups and downs.
BEAR16|It may be hit driven business.
BULL17|And yet, the fact that Netflix has managed to amass so many subscribers to its platform, and once you get those subscribers on the hook, they continue to pay, you know, quarter after quarter, it's still adding millions of people every quarter.
NEUT18|You know, it seems like this thing has a long runway to go.
NEUT19|Shares are trading at about $400 right now, and yet some analysts say it can go up to $500.
NEUT20|That's their price target for it.
BULL21|It's already up over 100% this year.
NEUT22|I am not saying that Reed Hastings is modeling its doubling.
NEUT23|Its huge.
NEUT24|And then it means double again or another 100 on top would be huge.
NEUT25|I'm not saying Reed Hastings isn't a great CEO isn't a genius.
NEUT26|I'm just not sure she is yes, to me it looks a lot like AOL Time Warner, where it's not like AOL was a bad business.
NEUT27|It just wasn't worth what people thought it was.
NEUT28|This is what it feels like to me.
BULL29|Well, hey, AOL is still getting money from those subscribers.
NEUT30|Two day as we speak there giving money to Verizon.
NEUT31|Now the owner of AOL at a much lower level.
NEUT32|It's now an $800 million company or so for sure.
NEUT33|But Netflix, you know, you said it's a hit driven business.
BULL34|They are trying so hard to get all of these new hit TV shows an.
NEUT35|You know TV shows, movies, they've got stranger things, they're inking, a deal with Dark, the German language TV show that's been all the rage.
BULL36|It seems like they've got enough in their stable to keep moving forward.
NEUT37|I'm not signing up again.
NEUT38|Well, that's all we have time for today.
