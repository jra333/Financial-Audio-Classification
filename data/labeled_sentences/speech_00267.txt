BULL0|"""How are you?"
NEUT1|How are you doing this whole year at large right?
NEUT2|Because 2020 has compressed a lot of decades.
NEUT3|In two months we've had learnings of which we could have learned over a decade in probably a month, month, and a half.
NEUT4|And now we have this US elections as well, which is going on.
NEUT5|How do you view this year thus far?
BEAR6|Yeah, so love still this year is on is not over so we have seen the all time high an all time low I mean additional high end digital low in last six months so.
NEUT7|I'm in this Healthcare is scared and, uh I mean anything getting better stock market so you know the kind of panic which is all in intensity of fuel.
NEUT8|I mean actually it played out right in front of me that intensity of fewer of fear of weight then the code itself.
NEUT9|Little girl was very small when market crashed and actually the day on which the market made a bottom.
NEUT10|That was a day one of the lockdown.
NEUT11|Can you believe this on 23rd March we went day, one of the oldest lockdown is the 23rd March and that is the day on which market.
NEUT12|But on the bottom.
BEAR13|So, uh, and the cases were less than 100 cases on that day.
NEUT14|So what I mean I read in a book it is there only two emotions in their market, didn't fear.
NEUT15|And I saw the field playing out.
NEUT16|And at that time it was not the event.
NEUT17|It was the fear of that event.
BEAR18|Fear of what could happen to the world economy, Indian economy to the lives of the people.
NEUT19|I mean as if the whole world is going to breakdown so that fear intensity of your led to the collapse.
NEUT20|And now the greatest.
NEUT21|Slowly slipping it.
NEUT22|You know now Grid is like a sector by sector like yesterday in banking or so.
NEUT23|Now the greedy is taking over that what is possible on other side an?
NEUT24|To see both greed and fear playing out in 12 months is quite a fun to watch.
NEUT25|I mean, it is completely up.
BULL26|What I would say, amazing experience.
NEUT27|I mean those who are keen observer, the market I think.
NEUT28|I mean this a lot because of my experience it allowed me to not being impacted first timers.
BEAR29|And you know those who entered right at the top said too much two years back and first time there seemed decline.
NEUT30|I'm I'm.
BEAR31|I'm telling you they have never had a terrible time.
BEAR32|They're not able to explain what hit them, and they're blaming the managers and also for their losses.
NEUT33|But this is the nature of the market.
NEUT34|So let's talk about what I was saying was that I remember that I don't remember the date, but I do remember that somewhere around April 1st week or thereabouts, or maybe March last week, you had said the be that you know who knows this 7500 could be a bottom, so those were famous words, right?
NEUT35|The famous last words in an opposite way, because it didn't turn out that way.
NEUT36|I heard you mention that now you're seeing greed seeping in.
NEUT37|I'm not asking you to make a prediction, but does that worry you at all?
NEUT38|There's nothing to worry in the market.
NEUT39|Is like a delicate season.
NEUT40|I mean, how good is the bowler?
NEUT41|How good is the pitch?
NEUT42|It doesn't matter.
NEUT43|You just go out there and play.
NEUT44|You know it's all given in the sense that the weather, it is a Biden or Trump, or whether it's China or Pakistan.
NEUT45|Whether it is a bull market or bear market, you have to go and play.
NEUT46|You can't.
NEUT47|You don't have a choice of not owning a stock or those kind of things.
NEUT48|So I I have seen all the all kinds of things.
NEUT49|This is fun.
NEUT50|"I mean whatever constraint you give will play."""
