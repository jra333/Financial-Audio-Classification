BULL0|"""Hello everyone boys and girls in welcome to market craze trading."
NEUT1|If you are new here my name is Steven.
NEUT2|If you are returning viewer welcome back.
NEUT3|Alright people were not just going to not talk about AMC in what AMC did today so we're definitely going to sit down and talk about AMC.
BEAR4|AMC really did start off the morning extremely strong but it did start to dip pretty hard earlier in the day.
BULL5|AMC Open the market up with a very nice almost 30% gain an it gained $3.
BEAR6|$0.75 that's pretty good, but then it dipped extremely hard.
BEAR7|OK, it dipped all the way into the negatives.
BEAR8|At some point it was, I think down like .25% much.
BEAR9|I mean isn't a huge negative, but it still did dip into the negatives.
NEUT10|I'm not a financial advisor by any means, but in my opinion, that is whenever people are supposed to pick up the dip switches.
NEUT11|What I did personally.
NEUT12|So yeah, MC was not looking too hot.
BULL13|Today we're back in the green, which is great.
NEUT14|An what do I think about AMC and what do I think?
NEUT15|AMC is going to look like tomorrow, so a lot of people think AMC is just going to hit 100 overnight, maybe even 203 hundred overnight.
NEUT16|I genuinely think that you guys that think that are stupid and not very bright.
NEUT17|If you look at AMC's graph compared to Gamestop's graph over the last couple weeks, AMC is having a similar graph to a GameStop was having at the beginning of its run up a stock like GameStop.
NEUT18|Going up in price like that like an insane increase in price does not just happen overnight, guys.
NEUT19|There is patience with the stock market.
NEUT20|I really hope you guys know that at this point a lot of people are getting their hopes up and don't have very much patience and think that hey, AMC is going to hit $50 by tomorrow, guys $50 by Wednesday $50 by Thursday.
NEUT21|I don't really know how confident I am that GameStop or AMC sorry is going to hit $50 by even this week.
NEUT22|I think I see it hitting $50 eventually, but this week, no, that's why.
NEUT23|It's smart to hold this out guys.
BULL24|The stock is not going to go up 10X, maybe even 20X in a matter of a couple of days.
NEUT25|Are you insane?
NEUT26|Like seriously, are you insane?
BULL27|GameStop started picking up momentum around $19.00 in January 5th and it took about almost 20 days for GameStop to actually go anywhere crazy.
BULL28|So the fact that AMC is already kind of ahead of that gives me a lot of good signs.
NEUT29|But hey, I would love to know what you guys think about this in the comment section below.
NEUT30|Are you guys still holding him?
NEUT31|See are you watching from the sidelines?
NEUT32|Maybe this got you interested in investing in general.
NEUT33|That would really be awesome if you guys would leave a comment, maybe leave a like and subscribe with post notifications.
NEUT34|Turn on.
NEUT35|I post videos like this every single day.
BULL36|But anyway, I hope you guys have a great rest of your day.
BULL37|Stay blessed and make sure you guys stay on top of these hot stocks and keep growing your money guys.
BULL38|"Hope you guys have a good one piece."""
