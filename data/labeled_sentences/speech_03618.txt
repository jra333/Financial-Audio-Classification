NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to a second note for today."
BEAR1|Coming to you twice because unfortunately I have to report that world stock markets are in their first bear market in some five years.
NEUT2|This is the Footsie all world index.
BEAR3|It's now down at the close here in Wall Street.
BEAR4|It's down more than 20% from its recent high.
NEUT5|You do see if you look at it in broader context that it's actually not that long since the last bear market that was when fears over the US credit limit the debt ceiling.
BULL6|Collided with worries about the eurozone too to give us a slightly greater bear market back in 2011.
BEAR7|Obviously it still doesn't compare with the fallout from the.com bust or the credit crisis, so there's still a lot further we could fall.
NEUT8|Or Alternatively, this is still not really such a deep market recession.
BULL9|Now if we want to go through the guts of today, we did actually see the S&P rise quite significantly after.
BULL10|In the afternoon, largely thanks to market rumors that OPEC is about to get its act together and coordinate to try to push up oil prices.
BULL11|Obviously, if it turns out to be true, that would help many risk assets, even if it is not exactly the panacea.
NEUT12|That to all that worries them, plainly the greatest concerns at this point about banks.
BEAR13|Beyond that, you saw a continued full in the dollar you saw very dramatic sell offs in Europe and in Asia.
NEUT14|And you saw.
BEAR15|Further pressure on banks.
BEAR16|While gold continued to prospect, the other very important trends, I think we need to look at briefly, if we take a look at this chart, the 10 year bond yield at this point is now almost back to as low as it has been in the last three years, and once it gets through that point, it doesn't wouldn't take much to do that.
BULL17|We would be very close to the Post War low that was hit in 2012.
NEUT18|Certainly many people assumed even.
BEAR19|Six months ago that that was going to be an enduring low that would last for a matter of years if not decades.
BULL20|Now we again seem to see weight of money moving back into the bond market.
NEUT21|It's very difficult to see how this can go on much further, but there it is quite remarkable.
BULL22|"Resurgence in the bond market while we see the bear market in world stocks."""
