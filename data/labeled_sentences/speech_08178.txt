NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, a nice overall day here on Apple.
BEAR4|I definitely started off shaky.
NEUT5|I mean the price.
NEUT6|Gap down came all the way down there, but I mean not to Pat myself on the back but they definitely Patch arts and touch.
NEUT7|One else is on the back look right where the price basically bonds off of right at that green line of support which I've talked about in past videos at the 122 mark and then from 122 back up at Wamp.
NEUT8|Now there's still a whole lot of work that needs to be done in the main bit of work that still kind of just sticking out like a sore thumb is all about that purple line there, which I know I've talked on past videos, the purple and my chart representing that very well known that very famous 50.
BEAR9|Moving average and you can see that right now the price is still struggling.
NEUT10|I mean really even approach right there.
NEUT11|You can see kind of got close kind of got close, kind of got closed and then even right here kind of got close.
NEUT12|But it can't even be in the price.
NEUT13|Can't even quite hit that area.
NEUT14|But the point here being that stuff is going to be the main area of resistance to keep an eye on very closely moving forward, not necessarily just on Thursday but over the next few days.
NEUT15|So if there is going to be any sort of chance at a bigger type reversal, 'cause right now you can't use the word reversal, you can use the word bounce.
NEUT16|There's no doubt about this.
NEUT17|Price is bouncing 100% true, but it's a reversal in my opinion that vocabulary should not be used.
BEAR18|Because the price is still down below that trendline there.
NEUT19|Now, if the price can break above that 50 per moving average and start to stay above it all right.
NEUT20|At that point, it makes more sense to start to have a conversation.
NEUT21|That, yeah, maybe the price is actually reversing, but in my opinion, at least right now, all the price is doing is balancing 'cause this could very well be a dead cat bounce with price heads back up and then totally rolls back over.
NEUT22|So I think the next couple of days will be very revealing.
NEUT23|In that situation, as far as where the main areas of support are already talked about that, but that's where 122 comes into play.
NEUT24|As long as the price stays above the 122 mark.
NEUT25|You know, then that does imply that the price of putting in an overall higher low, and that's what you want to see.
NEUT26|So main area of support, 122 main area of resistance at 50.
NEUT27|Moving average, let's the other one continues to play out.
NEUT28|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT30|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR34|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
