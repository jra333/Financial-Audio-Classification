BULL1|Palantir stock was up 10% today.
NEUT2|Alright, let's get started.
NEUT3|Shares of government data analytics company, Palantir NYSE PLT.
BULL4|Our stock shot up to close nine point, 8% higher Monday after the company announced that the US Army will be exercising an option to extend its partnership on the Army Vantage data analytics platform and for even a bit more money than the original contract was worth.
BULL5|One year ago, the Army Hyatt Palantir to work on Vantage under a potential four year contract awarding the company a $110 million contract for the first or base year, with the potential for contract renewals at one year intervals for three years afterwards.
BULL6|Today, the defense contractor confirmed that the Army is exercising at least the first of these options and awarding Palantir an additional $113.8 million for the work the Army has been using Vantage to make data driven decisions in the fight against COVID-19 notes.
BULL7|Palantir with the pandemic still ongoing.
NEUT8|It makes sense that the army would re up its contract at least for 2020.
BULL9|If the software continues to prove useful, the company could be awarded at least two more option renewals, bringing the total value of the four year contract to as much as $458 million.
NEUT10|Further renewals after the four year term would also not be out of the question.
NEUT11|All that would require is a new contract award.
BULL12|So Palantir could theoretically be looking at an even longer revenue stream, but even absent such an extension, today's news secures for Palantir, a significant chunk of its total revenue stream.
NEUT13|$1 billion over the past 12 months, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.
NEUT14|That could have ended at the end of this year.
BULL15|Now investors can rest certain that it will at least continue if not grow through the new year.
