BULL0|"""Thanks for joining everyone today."
BEAR1|We're talking about a potential breakout on ticker symbol in AKD.
NEUT2|The platform I'm using is Weibel.
NEUT3|I'll leave a link in the description below.
NEUT4|Sign up, get a couple of free stocks.
NEUT5|OK, let's get right into it.
NEUT6|I'm currently viewing that Red line on a four hour chart.
NEUT7|Moving average lines are set at 50 and 1:20.
BEAR8|Analyzing this chart, we can see there has been downtrending most of the year.
NEUT9|Until the beginning of November and AKD found the bottom at six cents.
BULL10|At that point, we were able to confirm a reversal.
NEUT11|As we zoom in.
BEAR12|We can see support levels at six cents with a nice spike to $0.33, then trending back down to support levels at $0.14.
NEUT13|Today we're currently trading at.
BULL14|$0.20 as we work our way closer to $0.33.
NEUT15|This will be the challenge.
NEUT16|As it is resistance.
NEUT17|This is where the breakout happens.
BULL18|If we gain enough momentum and break $0.33 the resistance level we can run above and beyond $0.50 based on analyzing the chart.
BEAR19|If you're a trader, then you'll want to sell as volume starts to slow on the breakout above $0.33.
NEUT20|If you're an investor, you want to hold this until May 2021.
NEUT21|This is because in AKD received 180 day extension from NASDAQ, which means this cannot have a reverse split until May 2021.
BULL22|Allowing them to gain compliance trading above a dollar for ten consecutive trading days.
NEUT23|Analyzing this chart, I see multiple breakouts happening from now until May.
BULL24|We could see significant gains.
NEUT25|We could see this move into the three to $5 range by May.
NEUT26|I always tell my students to look at stocks that are currently trading between 5:00 and $10 right now, as most of them you will see.
BEAR27|They were trading well below a dollar 6 to 12 months ago.
NEUT28|I love to teach patience.
NEUT29|I can't say it enough.
NEUT30|Patience is everything when it comes to profiting large on stocks.
BULL31|I hope this helps understand the analyst point of view on ticker symbol NAKDI.
