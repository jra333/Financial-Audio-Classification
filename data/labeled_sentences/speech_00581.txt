NEUT0|"""Everyone Steve here from the turtlefollower.com and in this video we're going to take a look at a short trade setup in host hotels and resorts, simp symbol HST and you can see here on the weekly chart."
NEUT1|First thing, we always want to look at is the weekly chart that we have broken below.
NEUT2|That's the daily chart.
BEAR3|Sorry bout that.
BEAR4|Here's the weekly chart so you can see that we have broken below the 200 day moving average.
BEAR5|Alright, So what was support now is going to become resistance and you can see that we are just trading lower.
BEAR6|OK, we're making a series of now lower lows and lower highs instead of where we were before making higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT7|So now that we know we want to be short and not long HST as you can see here, we also did break.
NEUT8|A pretty important trend line.
NEUT9|When you came back so we broke the trend line came back.
NEUT10|Tested the bottom side the trend line.
BEAR11|I have now broken down so now that we know we want to be long I'm sorry.
NEUT12|Short HST more than we want to belong it.
NEUT13|Now you look at the daily chart and you figure out where exactly do you want to be short and today presented a great opportunity to do so on the close below.
NEUT14|This level here at $20.
NEUT15|OK, so we were.
NEUT16|Kind of holding in this box and now again we're looking at.
NEUT17|A trade somewhere along this trendline could even tweak it just a little bit to make it hit.
NEUT18|Three points.
NEUT19|Instead of two.
NEUT20|Alright, so you could see there's your trendline.
NEUT21|Your breakdown now is below $20.
BULL22|It broke down today, volume increased so I would say if you're going to want to go ahead, you want to sell this tomorrow at the open.
NEUT23|Alright, and you're going to set a buy stop.
NEUT24|It's a little different.
NEUT25|OK, it's just the exact opposite of what we would do it for a long trade, but you're going to buy stop here at 2076.
NEUT26|So basically, you're risking from 2076.
NEUT27|Call it 21.
NEUT28|Just give yourself a little bit of room called 21 to 1950 so you're risking a dollar and a half.
NEUT29|On the trade size, the positions accordingly, and this one you know, just let it run.
NEUT30|Same thing you're going to continue to trail your stop slower as it continues to move lower.
NEUT31|It may come back.
NEUT32|Test the trend line and then you just continue to trail your stop lower.
NEUT33|So that's the trade.
NEUT34|The short trade and HST host hotels and resorts.
