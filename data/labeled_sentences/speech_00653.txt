NEUT0|"""For watching this quick video on sandal growers stock we are in stock market and this is one hour candle stick showing the price movement of these stock."
NEUT1|So first of all just get a lot of news and information regarding this stock and always compare this company with other companies in the same business of the cannabis delegates products or just.
NEUT2|Kind of bees.
NEUT3|So there are lots of so many other companies in the same businesses and it's always good to compare to have a better understanding of this be a of this talk on this market currently of the cannabis.
NEUT4|So if all the theoretically all of them they should perform, they should perform in the same way so or at least the majority of them as it's happening right now for electric cars or perhaps 3D printers or other businesses like hydrogen as well I drogen.
NEUT5|And engines as well, etc etc.
NEUT6|So just all these companies in the same business theoretically should perform in the same way as always.
NEUT7|Good to do a comparison, it's gone, I'll pass, I give confidence in our choices.
BULL8|So again, read a lot of news and compare with other companies in the same business.
BEAR9|In front of us, it seems that this stock has been performing bearish way since coronavirus came in an hour since since the beginning of November.
BULL10|Active going up again.
NEUT11|It's a very cheap stock.
NEUT12|It's worth to invest into it.
NEUT13|A lot of people's already invested into it, so that's why it has been.
NEUT14|It has been one of the most traded stock ever, so the idea is based on my technical analysis.
NEUT15|Interpretation is just to go longer, be 'cause it seems.
NEUT16|This one can be seen as possible.
BULL17|Trendline has been tested 123 times to be tested properly.
NEUT18|It will be sure that this one has been a third time that has been tested over on this one.
NEUT19|Or this point?
NEUT20|There we just need to wait for a new peak.
NEUT21|There should be higher than the previous one, so the idea is most likely the first target price would be open 95 U.S. dollar and while the next one can be 1.25 U.S. dollars.
NEUT22|So the idea is just to go longer.
NEUT23|Yes for this company and and yes just to go along with first target price of open.
NEUT24|And if I use stolen second target price or 1.25 U.S. dollar.
NEUT25|Following the major, the major trend that is a bullish trend.
BULL26|Just quick comparison with Arora Arora is performing well as well.
NEUT27|Just start going up in.
NEUT28|Maybe that's maybe you know we need to check if it's proper one because it might be neutral in the line because you know this peak is bill slower than this one, But anyway the other option is that those prices are moving inside the channel between 20 U.S. dollar and this one is almost 2.5 or three U.S. dollar and now we are at the bottom of this channel so that is to go.
NEUT29|Longer up to this 20 U.S. dollar again, so theoretically and you can keep keep comparing with other companies that you will see a you will see that all of them again they should behave in the same way.
NEUT30|So for Aurora that is to go along as well As for Sonia Grover's, this is my understanding of this stock and just Please remember that technical analysis it's not under percent.
NEUT31|Sure this is just my interpretation of this stock, so this is a new bullish trend bullish market.
BULL32|New peak higher than the previous one and hopefully this one is going to be higher than the previous one, just to give a confirmation that this is a really bullish trend.
NEUT33|Thank you.
NEUT34|That's all from my side.
NEUT35|"Thanks, bye."""
