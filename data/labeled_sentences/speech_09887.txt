NEUT0|"""So Goldman would be joining a string of prominent names, thinking about heading to the Sunshine State."
BEAR1|Absolutely, we're seeing a major trend of companies heading South leaving the trading floors in the New York City area where we've got covid.
NEUT2|We also have a high tax rate.
NEUT3|We also have a high cost of living and the pandemic, which is moved so many New York financial firms rapidly into the work from Home mode, has played a role here.
NEUT4|Bloomberg has learned the Goldman success in operating remotely during the pandemic.
BULL5|Has persuaded members of its leadership team that they can move more rolls out of the New York area to save money.
NEUT6|As you may recall, Goldman said a very ambitious goal of saving approximately 1.3 billion in costs.
NEUT7|Now, according to people close to the matter, Goldman may still decide to keep their asset management division in New York.
BULL8|It could also decide to relocate more jobs to Dallas.
NEUT9|Another warm winter city where it is been.
BULL10|Accelerating expanding its role, its asset management unit is the key division.
NEUT11|As mentioned, the firm made 8 billion in annual revenue from this division in recent years and again the lure of Florida is well known.
NEUT12|It is a warm weather state.
NEUT13|There is zero state income tax for employees.
NEUT14|That is a very big luhr.
NEUT15|There's also a much lower cost for office space for living space.
NEUT16|And yes, that has been part of the draw.
BEAR17|The deliberations that Goldman, which is often a consider on Wall Street, is adding to the cloud over New York's future.
BEAR18|As we know, this city has been seeing a steady exodus, not just a residence to surrounding states, but also of white collar jobs to other areas where there are lower operational costs.
NEUT19|Juliet.
NEUT20|Yeah, you're talking there about how this could all hurt New York City, so I guess what's next?
NEUT21|And do you think we see more firms you know?
NEUT22|Follow suit here and head to Florida?
NEUT23|Well, let's talk about the ones we already know about, and there are some major names.
NEUT24|Major hedge funds, major financial firms.
NEUT25|You have.
NEUT26|Paul Singer's Elliott management.
NEUT27|That's an activist firm planning to move the headquarters for its $41 billion hedge fund, a West Palm Beach.
NEUT28|That's right around the Miami area.
NEUT29|You also have Ken Griffin Citadel, a widely followed major hedge fund, and Blacks there also moving their firms and increasing their present.
BULL30|Blackstone, I should say, increasing their presence.
NEUT31|In the Miami area, it's also important to mention that Goldman tops are rival.
NEUT32|JP Morgan Chase had flirted with the idea back in 2013 of moving to Florida.
NEUT33|Its CEO famously praised Florida's business friendly environment and joked aloud about why not move the whole bank down there.
NEUT34|I mean the weather is gorgeous.
NEUT35|An again the cost of living is clearly cheaper and the cost of operation.
NEUT36|And that's a key concern for so many financial firms.
BEAR37|In this post, covid environment for New York City, by the way, it is seeing more empty office buildings, or at least the same amount that it saw in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.
BEAR38|"And that's a serious concern not only for the tax base, but what it means for New York City as a financial center."""
