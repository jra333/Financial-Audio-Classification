NEUT1|So most recently we're seeing the National Black Justice Coalition calling on the famed Masters Tournament.
NEUT2|Of course, it's held every year at the Augusta National.
NEUT3|Well, they're calling on it to move this year, essentially saying the Professional Golf should not award the removal or the attack on democracy and the voting process with the millions of dollars that this tournament will bring into the Peach State.
BEAR4|We're also seeing from the Major League Baseball Players Association concern among players.
NEUT5|About the All Star game, that's set to be played here in Atlanta in July.
BEAR6|Some players calling on that to be moved and then across social media and from some very big names there are calls for boycotts on companies like Coca Cola, Home Depot, Delta Airlines, all of which of course are Georgia based Giants giant companies.
NEUT7|So there's also question about what this means for the film industry, and there are some raising their voices saying that that should also be looked at as well here in Georgia too.
NEUT8|So certainly some big questions.
NEUT9|Some advocates say that yes, these big companies have a responsibility.
BEAR10|To raise their voices and speak out against legislation that critics are calling blatant voter suppression chat.
