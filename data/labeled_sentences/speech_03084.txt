BULL0|"""So Steve, there's a lot of buzz out there about an imminent Facebook IPO."
NEUT1|What what's going on out there?
NEUT2|Well, word is a filing could come as soon as this week.
NEUT3|Now what that means is they'll file documents with the SEC declaring their intent to go public.
NEUT4|There will be a letter from the CEO from the management team.
NEUT5|What that doesn't mean is that they're going to go public this week.
NEUT6|You can't buy Facebook shares on Friday if they file in this one on Wednesday.
NEUT7|What happens after this one is filed?
NEUT8|Is the SEC and regulators will review what Facebook is offering.
NEUT9|Then there's negotiations in terms of which exchange they list on which ticker they'll list on there.
NEUT10|Then after a period of usually three to six months at a minimum, the company will go public and they'll go on their roadshow and pitch the offering to investors.
NEUT11|Very few companies get out in less than say, three or four months, so we have a little bit of a runway before we actually see how big.
NEUT12|How big is this Facebook IPO going to be?
NEUT13|Well, the word is that you know it could be anywhere at a valuation from 75 million to $100 billion.
NEUT14|Facebook shares have traded on private markets that have been private deals.
NEUT15|Private investments in the company that have given the company valuations.
NEUT16|It remains to be seen what the public market will value it at, but it's a safe bet to say it's going to be one of the biggest IPO's that we've seen across the market.
NEUT17|And certainly one of the biggest, if not the biggest in the technology space.
NEUT18|And So what is this?
NEUT19|What does this mean for the market?
NEUT20|Should we be bullish because Facebook is planning to come public?
NEUT21|Well, getting a big deal like this.
NEUT22|Price is always a good sign.
BULL23|It means the market is healthy and ready to receive an offering of this size.
NEUT24|It's also hard to extract too much broad based knowledge from a deal like this, which is a hugely popular company, one that a lot of people know about it.
NEUT25|Let's face it, they have hundreds of millions of members.
NEUT26|So even if just those Members want to buy shares, that's enormous demand for a stock like this.
NEUT27|So it's hard to extrapolate that this is a bullish signal for the market in general.
NEUT28|But there's a lot of folks with a vested interest in getting a deal like this done, including their underwriters, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are talked about as the most likely to be leading this offering.
BEAR29|It was a rough 2000 to 2011 for investment banking companies.
NEUT30|They certainly want to get a deal like this out.
BULL31|They want to get into the market and they wanted to do well.
NEUT32|What about social media as a sector to be invested in?
NEUT33|Is it a good sector for investors?
NEUT34|It's hard to say that it's a sector that is one way or the other across the board.
NEUT35|We've seen a number of high profile social media offerings over the last year.
NEUT36|Just a few examples are Groupon, Zynga, Pandora and LinkedIn.
BEAR37|Only two of those four, LinkedIn and Zynga are trading above their offering price.
NEUT38|The other two are trading below.
NEUT39|"So to say that social media companies are a home run on the public market a little early for that, but we'll see what happens with Facebook."""
