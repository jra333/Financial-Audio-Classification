BEAR1|Zelica price has seen an excellent run up since its breakout, but now the rally could reverse if demand barriers fail.
BULL2|Zelica Price rose 165% between mid January and February, creating a flagpole.
BEAR3|However, after this initial Spike, Zilla developed a Pennant as it formed lower highs and higher lows.
NEUT4|Together.
NEUT5|The setup is known as a bullish Pennant.
BULL6|The technical formation forecasted a 62% upswing to 21 cents, determined by measuring the flagpoles height and adding it to the breakout point at $0.13.
BULL7|Since its breakout on March 11th, Zelinka Price has rallied 50% and needs another spike in bullish momentum to complete its last leg up.
BEAR8|However, the breakout line at 19 cents has proven to be a stiff barrier that has prevented silica from crossing over.
BULL9|If buyers managed to gather steam that could shatter this supply, barrier's illegal price will complete its 62% rally and hit its intended target.
BULL10|Supporting this outlook is the persistence of the recently flashed by signal from the Super Trend indicator, hence the likely course of action for silica is to slice through the MRI's breakout line after a minor retracement to $0.16.
BEAR11|While things seem to be evolving when it comes to zelica price, investors should note that a breakdown of the 15 cents level will create a lower low.
BEAR12|In such a case, a 25% down trend to the demand barrier at 11 cents seems likely.
BEAR13|A buildup in bearish momentum here.
BULL14|Mites easily retraced to 0.095 dollars.
BULL15|In the interest of brevity, zelica price broke out of a bullish Pennant formation and is on track to hit its target at $0.21.
NEUT16|Momentum reversal indicators.
BULL17|Breakout line at 19 cents has stopped Silicas run up.
BEAR18|The bull rally could reverse if the 15 cents level is breached, as it would create a lower low.
