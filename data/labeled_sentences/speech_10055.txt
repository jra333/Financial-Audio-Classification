BULL0|"""Disney has seen its value doubled since the end of March 2020, despite the effects of the pandemic."
NEUT1|But it's not too late to buy into the stock with the company having not yet benefited from Disney.
NEUT2|Plus, the streaming service and their theme parks operating at the same time.
NEUT3|The full operation of their parks depends on the vaccine rollout and consumer confidence.
NEUT4|The theme park sector of Disney's business accounted for the largest proportion of their revenue in 2019.
BULL5|While the parks were closed last year, the company was able to adapt their business, creating a more personalized and frictionless experience.
BULL6|Investments such as contactless screening, keyless check-in and mobile ordering for food have improved the park sufficiency, expanding their profit margins.
NEUT7|Once Disneyland's open worldwide.
BULL8|So as Disney moves to a more digital model of business with a consistently growing streaming service and upgraded theme parks, their potential has been building up to let loose once the pandemic ends.
BULL9|This makes it a good buy and one that is being under estimated by the market as a whole.
BULL10|I hope you enjoyed this video, found it useful.
