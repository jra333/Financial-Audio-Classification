BULL0|"""Hello and welcome to Tripoli treats."
NEUT1|Fundamental analysis.
NEUT2|In the past few days there's been increasing focus on Apple stocks as we are in the lead up to the unveiling of the iPhone 8 on the 12th of September.
BULL3|We've seen since the beginning of July, a trend of ever increasing prices in Apple stocks, and this comes essentially as a result of a positive buzz in the media surrounding the release of the iPhone 8 and overall positive sales figures.
NEUT4|So investors in Apple are going to be watching carefully what happens on the 12th of September, and what extent the positive buzz that has been going on recently is going to continue after the iPhone 8 itself is unveiled.
BEAR5|More generally, in the markets, it appears that North Korea's recent nuclear test has been discounted as gold, as declined somewhat in price today.
NEUT6|In addition to the other conventional safe havens of the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen.
BULL7|Mainly as a result of the perception of increased confidence in the UK, in particularly the possibility that the Bank of England might raise interest rates, the pound Sterling has been doing significantly better, especially today, against the dollar.
BULL8|We expect that these trends are likely to continue in the next few days.
NEUT9|However, it is very important to watch the European Central Bank's policy meeting on the 7th of September.
NEUT10|This has been Tripoli trees.
NEUT11|Fundamental analysis.
BULL12|"We're watching and we hope to see you again soon."""
