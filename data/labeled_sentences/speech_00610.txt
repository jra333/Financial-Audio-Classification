NEUT0|"""Let's take a look at some areas standing out to us this morning with some of the Fang names we haven't talked about."
BEAR1|The big cap tech stocks and we were talking earlier in the program about how a number of these names have kind of been flat over the last few months.
NEUT2|A stealth, not rally.
NEUT3|I guess we could call it not at decline, but certainly not a ton of enthusiasm around what had been obviously huge winners.
NEUT4|Real leaders coming out of that market low in March of 2020.
BEAR5|We see here Apple shares there under pressure off about 3%.
NEUT6|Facebook is actually in the green this morning.
BEAR7|Facebook's been the real laggard of this group in the last few months.
NEUT8|So back to that theme of whatever had been working isn't whatever hasn't been working now is seeing that play out just a bit today.
NEUT9|Let's also take a look at shares of Tesla.
NEUT10|Obviously a star of the show just about every day the market is open.
BEAR11|Tesla shares here off some 6% in early trading.
BEAR12|We see they are again off of their session lows.
BEAR13|We saw the stock down more than 8%.
BEAR14|Wiping out its gains for 2021, the stock is trading right now.
BEAR15|It is also trading below the level at which it traded when it came into the S&P 500, though it is, I believe, slightly positive for the year.
BEAR16|But again, stock with a lot of volatility just in the last couple of sessions off some 14% and also part of the market story now is Bitcoin what's happening with the digital currency?
NEUT17|I think you know, maybe some people would wish it isn't, but sorry, Bitcoin is now a major part of what's going to be moving.
NEUT18|The major US averages and so is certainly a part of this picture.
BEAR19|Earlier this morning, Bitcoin was down around 46,000, the second straight day that we've seen big early morning.
NEUT20|Call it like predawn hours here on the East Coast of the United States.
BEAR21|Sell offs is where we sort of bottomed out that we kind of see three tests of that bottom just within the last couple of hours.
NEUT22|Again in the mid 46 thousands we came into the year Bitcoin was trading around 20,000.
NEUT23|I don't think the ardent bulls are really all that worried about.
NEUT24|This price action, we know that Bitcoin goes up and down for all kinds of reasons.
NEUT25|Sometimes no reason at all, and certainly some volatility in the price today.
NEUT26|But it is definitely a part of the broader risk picture, and I think the procyclicality of Bitcoin not as a hedge but as something to play momentum and and kind of broad sentiment within the market.
NEUT27|"That idea has certainly become more mainstream and so certainly something that we watch on a day like."""
