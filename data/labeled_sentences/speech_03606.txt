BULL0|"""There's no doubt the economy is on the upswing."
BULL1|Stocks have responded.
NEUT2|I guess the big question is how much of the stock move the last six to nine months is already pricing in the kind of economic moves we're starting to see now.
NEUT3|Good morning, Brian.
BULL4|Thank you for having me.
BEAR5|I will argue that it's pricing in a lot of it, but look the market has been stretched for years.
BULL6|OK Market was up in 20, nineteen, 30%, 2020, 18%.
NEUT7|This is with a pandemic with all the things going on.
NEUT8|So growth stocks value stocks.
NEUT9|The market is not low.
NEUT10|Not OK, very nice choice of words, not load.
NEUT11|Does that mean too high or kind of like the middle porridge Catherine?
BEAR12|Well, you know my crystal ball broke on the way here.
NEUT13|I would argue on the high side, but what do I know?
BEAR14|But I've been saying this for a while and it just seems to keep going up.
NEUT15|Look at look what happened with IPOs.
BULL16|It's but very healthy even with a little bit of NASDAQ meltdown the past few weeks still had very healthy IPO, so there's a lot going on.
NEUT17|Alright, we have a uh, by the way Catherine, throw and throw this out there, we have a quarterly survey at CNBC where we like to, you know, survey, a contributor strategist.
NEUT18|Folks like yourself that are running money.
NEUT19|We ask them what the most crowded trade might be in the market's 41%, said Bitcoin.
NEUT20|32% said big tech.
NEUT21|Obviously the numbers don't add up to 121 cyclicals and 6% small caps.
NEUT22|Would you agree?
NEUT23|I mean, big tech Bitcoin just.
NEUT24|I don't know if most crowded means too crowded, but there you go.
NEUT25|I would agree with Bitcoin, no question big tech.
NEUT26|I am not sure about.
BULL27|I think to say that the overall market overall market is high.
BULL28|Big tech at least has growth characteristics.
NEUT29|These are, you know, we're using more and more of technology.
NEUT30|Everything you use, you have to go in and pay Silicon Valley there little tax.
NEUT31|OK, I'm talking.
NEUT32|Getting on Google using your phone, your the cloud everything.
BULL33|Everyone working remotely, you're using big tech, so at the very least I think big tech you're seeing growth to go with it.
NEUT34|The rest of the market, materials, financials, energy.
NEUT35|I'm not so sure.
NEUT36|Alright Catherine, I want to ask you about the big market story the last few days archegos and I'm only asking because a little Birdy, IE might.
NEUT37|My notes on the interview tell me that you and your fund own discovery.
BEAR38|Obviously Friday, not a good day for you.
NEUT39|Your take on the macro situation and maybe are you buying discovery on the weakness of 27% drop in one day on Friday?
BULL40|We added a little bit to the discovery position again.
BEAR41|The backdrop is, it was brutal.
NEUT42|What happened on Friday.
NEUT43|It was absolutely.
NEUT44|Did not really know what was going on.
NEUT45|There was no news or calling the company saying what is going on.
NEUT46|Same thing happened with Viacom eventually find out it's 'cause of Archegos.
BEAR47|That's a nightmare.
NEUT48|I mean I don't know where else it's legal to put eight different mortgages on the same house.
NEUT49|That's what you have with the swaps market investment banks got nailed on it, no more a.
BEAR50|It looks like no more is gonna lose half of their years profits from this Credit Suisse.
NEUT51|Yep sax.
BEAR52|So it's it's been a disaster.
NEUT53|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT54|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
