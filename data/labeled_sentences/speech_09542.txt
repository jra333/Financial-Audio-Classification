BEAR1|We're using the dashboard by Eminem trading platform, so first thing is we had a PFH which is a bearish signal provided by the dashboard and once that signal actually fired in right here, we were able to ride it all the way down so far and we had this huge gap to the downside.
BULL2|Thanks to the dashboard notifying us.
BULL3|New top that's been established, so we have about a $14.00 move.
BULL4|"The downside, and we also have my other laptop here and it would just scouting some currency pairs so we have a good number of trades ahead this week, so it's going to be a fantastic week."""
