BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about Pepsi today.
NEUT2|Not really Pepsi.
NEUT3|The brand more Pepsi, the conglomerate because they do so much more than just Pepsi.
NEUT4|And as you can see, there's still a sale going on and it's getting discounts are getting steep, so I figured I'd focus this week on stocks that really shouldn't be affected or companies that really shouldn't be affected by the current situation.
NEUT5|But their stocks somehow are, so there might be some bargains here, and that's kind of why we're looking at Pepsi today.
NEUT6|Now what they do is they have snacks and soft drinks and juices and flavored sparkling water and other things.
NEUT7|So obviously all things that really shouldn't suffer in a recession because people will still buy that unless their situation gets so bad that they live on water.
NEUT8|Andromeda, which I hope it doesn't get to that current price, is just under $104.00, which gives the market cap of 100.
BEAR9|$45 billion and they dropped 11% on Friday, which means.
NEUT10|Somehow people think that this company will be affected.
NEUT11|That's not it, by the way.
NEUT12|It's just that people sell stocks they shouldn't be selling because the whole market is going on and also in their part of an index.
BEAR13|Or many of them, and so the whole thing is going down.
BEAR14|That's kind of dragging them with them.
BEAR15|Dividend yield is almost 4% with a parent ratio of 73%, which is not great necessarily, especially in the current situation, but it's definitely not tearable revenue.
BULL16|$67 billion up 3% so almost.
BEAR17|$3 billion, almost 5% from the previous year, earning $7.3 billion down from 12.5.
NEUT18|But the 12.5 was the outlier, not the 7.3.
BULL19|It's up significantly from the previous two years, which is obviously a good thing.
NEUT20|P of 20 forward PE of 18.
BULL21|Also not Tearable total assets $78.5 billion, slightly up total liability $63.7 billion.
BULL22|Also slightly up which gives them total stockholders equity of $14.8 billion, which is also slightly up and overall, as I said, they're a big company conglomerate group of brands that really shouldn't be affected too much by a recession.
NEUT23|They might get affected if things get really bad, and as I said I, I hope it doesn't come to that.
NEUT24|So if you're looking for safe stocks, there's obviously some retailers that are not going to be affected, and they are currently up even during this time, which is like Walmart or Amazon or.
BULL25|I'm not sure where the Walgreens stock is, but they're obviously going to stay open and probably make more money than they did before.
NEUT26|But Pepsi is one of those stocks that is very safe in that the whole set of brands that they sell is not going to be affected too much by the recession.
NEUT27|And even if.
BEAR28|There is a prolonged recession.
NEUT29|I wouldn't expect them to really be affected too much.
NEUT30|That's it for me.
NEUT31|For today.
