BEAR0|"""Facebook shares down 14 percent, $23.00."
BEAR1|The stock was as low as 2228.
BEAR2|This morning, shares are just getting hammered almost relentlessly.
BEAR3|After yesterday's disappointing earnings and almost bizarre conference call.
NEUT4|And that's what we're going to focus on right now, 'cause we all know the earnings have disseminated the numbers, but let's see what that conference call at 5:00 PM.
NEUT5|So I'm here with David Benoit Deal Journal Blogger.
NEUT6|Who was your liveblogging it?
NEUT7|On your way, you know I help little bit I threw in a little bit you and me and grocer.
BEAR8|That was a very strange conference call Ann.
BEAR9|I don't think investors came away feeling very good about it.
NEUT10|Yeah, I think in some ways there are kind of two, I think faults here one was.
NEUT11|I think the analyst just kind of stuck to asking very like questions about how to model the future that the normal investor you know everyday investor.
NEUT12|Which is what Facebook was all about.
NEUT13|These big kind of retail investors just no one got an answer out of.
BULL14|Is this a quarter that you know is going to improve or we're going to see anything in the future?
NEUT15|We really learned they were really very few, even in tough questions, hard questions.
NEUT16|I mean nobody came out and said give us an out, give us an outlook, give us guidance, tell us what there were no real numbers for investors to gauge right?
NEUT17|There weren't even questions like how should we think about revenue in future, which is something you hear a lot where it's kind of like a way an analyst will ask for guidance.
NEUT18|And executives are usually pretty willing to at least give thoughts about right.
NEUT19|You know their their emotions about the future right now.
NEUT20|One thing they did talk about was the user base.
NEUT21|How many users they have in there it is.
BULL22|You can see that their overall the monthly active users rose to 955 million daily active users.
NEUT23|552,000,000 mobile mobile is interesting to keep an eye on that one 543 and you know looked at their mobiles a big deal for them, right?
BULL24|They were optimistic sounding about mobile but again with no good numbers with no good projections or plans.
NEUT25|All you got yesterday was Mark Zuckerberg.
NEUT26|Kind of talking extemporaneously about what they're thinking about, right, exactly, and even kind of a lot of the call and actually kind of a stunning amount of the call was spent talking about this sponsored stories, which is where they sell to GM.
NEUT27|Well, not to GM here anymore.
NEUT28|Yeah, they sell to Applebee's in advertisement that shows up in your news feed on your mobile phone.
NEUT29|It's the only way they can sell an ad on mobile.
NEUT30|Except that they also kept saying it's very early.
NEUT31|It's a very small part of our revenue.
BULL32|It's doing well.
NEUT33|It's making a million a day, which doesn't sound like that's certainly not, you know, kind of numbers that will get you in 8090% PE ratio or a $90.00.
BEAR34|They did not do very well yesterday.
NEUT35|"That conference call notes there first, but not a very good one."""
