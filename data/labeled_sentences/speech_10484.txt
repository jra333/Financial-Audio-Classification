NEUT0|"""Jim, there's a lot to unpack on Boeing this morning."
NEUT1|Bear does make it a topic as they are bullish on the return of air travel.
NEUT2|We mentioned the cow and call their essentially saying the return of air travel is probably a second half story given some of the hiccups that we're seeing now in vaccine distribution.
NEUT3|And then of course the crash out of Jakarta, which I'm sure will check in with Phil LeBeau on later on this morning.
NEUT4|Yeah, I mean, this is let's find the black box and see what was said, but I think that the notes that are positive or why the stock ran from 160 to 200.
NEUT5|My Chapel trust owns that we just said look if everyone gets vaccinated, then people go places.
BEAR6|There's obviously a plane shortage.
NEUT7|Everybody goes places because we're so pent up.
NEUT8|The pent up demand could be extraordinary.
NEUT9|But I agree with the second half notion, we gotta find out what's in the black box of the crash.
NEUT10|Terrible thing, but more more important point of view of this stock, not other people, because money can't be conflated with the loss.
NEUT11|But with the stock, Carl is, the is the vaccine itself.
NEUT12|When I listen to Doctor Gottlieb this morning and he's so good, I said to myself, wow, if they could figure this thing out.
NEUT13|It would be a first half story, but it doesn't sound like they are.
BEAR14|The thing obviously is the distribution of the vaccine, which is pretty shameful, I think.
BULL15|Yeah, although Biontech did raise their 2021 capacity to 2 billion doses, which is a lot.
NEUT16|And we mentioned Gilead in the hopes for J&J, although it doesn't sound like you think that's going to be January story, which we have been hoping for.
NEUT17|No, and I was hoping it would be when they announced their quarter.
NEUT18|I do think coral that making the vaccine is not the issue and it's Doctor Gottlieb said one day we're going to be so there will be a vaccine glut.
NEUT19|It is this uneven distribution system, and that's a polite word.
NEUT20|So they've got the vaccine.
BEAR21|A lot of places, throwing the vials out 'cause this stuff is already bad.
NEUT22|I mean, this is.
BEAR23|I think there's a lot of people who are saying this is not the way to do it, and it may be President elect Biden will have a better way.
NEUT24|But right now there's far more vaccine than there is at this very moment.
BEAR25|People were lining up to get it, 'cause we're all pretty much discouraged, though.
NEUT26|I live in New Jersey, I don't know anyone who hasn't registered.
NEUT27|I also don't know anyone who's got it, so it does seem to be a real free for all, with Florida being the.
NEUT28|Greatest East Coast.
NEUT29|You get it.
NEUT30|West Coast.
NEUT31|It's just chaos.
NEUT32|Tallahassee no one seems to be getting.
NEUT33|It's kind of a microcosm.
NEUT34|What's going on in this country right now or?
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
