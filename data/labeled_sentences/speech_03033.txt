NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to Day Trader S&P 500 this is Dale Woodson, editor of Woodson Wave Report, one of Timer Digest Top ranked market timers."
NEUT1|Since we are new to YouTube, we appreciate if you can hit that subscribe button and the reminder Bell and give us a like thank you so much today we're going to talk about technical analysis of the S&P 500 and we have a little Tesla.
NEUT2|To work with today we're looking at an hourly bar of the S&P 500.
BEAR3|So much going on here.
BEAR4|We have that island reversal, and at the June 8th I we gapped up here, spent four days and gapped down.
BULL5|Thus the island island reversal and then that is our second wave of primary degree high.
BEAR6|We have five waves down into the June 15 low.
NEUT7|Then we came up and made basically.
NEUT8|A triple top if there is such a thing, but a second wave high was here, we get a second wave of 1 lesser degree an what do we get again?
NEUT9|But another island reversal?
BEAR10|A gap up?
NEUT11|Some hours about what?
BEAR12|6-8 hours at the high and then a gap down.
NEUT13|Not coincidentally, our third wave down, as you can see at intermediate degree we had wave one down and two up.
NEUT14|That's a parentheses.
NEUT15|From there we had a wave one down a two up wave, three gained a 1.618 fibbonaci, multiple with wave one.
NEUT16|Within one point of being exact, since it is a third wave and 3rd waves can take on any multiple first waves they want, we must allow for a 2.618 multiple at 2955 a 3.618 at 2879 Anna four times multiple at 2832.
BEAR17|We can't allow for a bounce up tomorrow morning, may last hours to correct this way first before we head down.
BULL18|So very important, double bearish indicator.
NEUT19|If an island reversal is bearish, then I guess a double island reversal is double bears.
NEUT20|Keep in mind from our previous long term analysis we had a target for this bigger 3rd wave down of primary degree at 2030 for the S&P and now we also want to take a look if we can at Tesla Tesla's high back here in February.
BULL21|We had a wave down and since then we've had a perfect five waves up.
BEAR22|We had two different Fibonacci target price targets, one at 1012, one at 1025, so we expect a decline from that high.
NEUT23|A382 retracement gives us a target right in here of 767.
NEUT24|That's also the area of the previous fourth wave.
NEUT25|A 50% retracement gives us a target of 687 for Tesla Deskto bottom of the fourth wave, and a 618 retracement takes us all the way down to 608 on Tesla.
NEUT26|Nice short sweet analysis.
BULL27|Tonight again, remember, hit that subscribe and like button and we appreciate you guys watching our YouTube channel.
