NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol X PEV."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|We're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will let him in the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some Contacts here, but overall very impressive bouncing when you think about the fact that the price at one point was all the way down there on the open and is now battled itself all the way back to where it has very impressive.
NEUT5|Now of course, yeah there's still more work that needs to be done, but point here being the price made a great move which does bring about the more than valid question of.
NEUT6|But is there any sort of true power behind this president?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT8|Dead Cat bounce that move and I have no idea.
NEUT9|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward.
NEUT10|In my mind, it all revolves around a single area, and that area is down here at $31.
NEUT11|Now.
NEUT12|Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is what's going to actually happen, but just from an explanation standpoint perspective, if the price were to come down to 31, behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that do to the price?
NEUT13|That would quite literally putting the price right back in as that area of the chart that it just broke out from it.
NEUT14|I mean not to insult your intelligence but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power to strength or anything like that.
NEUT15|Whereas on the flip side of things 'cause to be fair, no price is just going to go straight up forever, but if the price were to come down here.
NEUT16|Behave in that manner, then start to work the way back upwards.
NEUT17|Now what you have, while you have a set of those right there, you have Lowe's down there.
NEUT18|And if you envision each one of those, is there steps?
NEUT19|Well, hey there, we go.
NEUT20|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
BULL21|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT22|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $31 as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|The main level to watch in the very near term going to be that pink line right there, which I might start to notice that 200.
NEUT24|Moving average and is currently valued at $33.50.
NEUT25|So keep a close eye on that.
NEUT26|But All in all any angle.
NEUT27|Look at it.
BULL28|Very nice bonds today.
NEUT29|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT30|Let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT33|But it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL35|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT40|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
