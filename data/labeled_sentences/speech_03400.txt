NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Glenn this via video chart on ticker symbol FUBO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Went absolutely crazy day in.
NEUT5|Unfortunately the bearish sense, but there is a very interesting dynamic here that played out late day and that is to give credit credits.
NEUT6|Do a nice little bounce here.
NEUT7|Now, is this bounce truly strong?
NEUT8|Is that just a dead cat bounce that all remains to be seen?
BULL9|But the point here being is at least it started to show some upwards strength, which brings it more.
NEUT10|What makes it a valid question?
NEUT11|Be wondering now, hey, maybe this is the start of some sort of turn around now.
NEUT12|Doesn't mean it is a turn around, but case in point, let's just say that the chart look like this and I was sitting here saying wow, it's looking like there might be a turn around here.
NEUT13|You would be 100% justified to say what are you talking about based on what the price is literally going straight down, but that's not the case, right?
BULL14|It has actually shown some signs of turn around.
NEUT15|So now the question just becomes right.
NEUT16|Well, where some of these main areas that moving forward and the first level is nothing fancy or complicated, I'm going to just call the level of support right there at 21, because if this is some sort of bottom.
NEUT17|If this is some sort of turn around will then by definition you want to want to see the price come down here and then break down below that level, because what would that be doing that would all of a sudden be putting the price at new lows, which is the exact opposite of a turn around, right?
NEUT18|So just kind of common sense from that angle of things, and why 21 would be important?
NEUT19|Because if this is the bottom.
NEUT20|If this is a turn around, well, you just don't want to see the price.
BEAR21|Of sudden break to new lows, that's just it would be a total contradiction.
NEUT22|But if the price can continue on up where these areas of resistance at next key battleground to watch very closely going to be right up there at 2250 and then of 2250 can be broken, next level of resistance after that, right up there on.
NEUT23|That makes it easy.
NEUT24|2350 So 22 fifty 2350 next couple of key roadblocks to watch moving forward.
BEAR25|But overall yeah, brutal day.
BULL26|But a very impressive bounce to closeout the day close out the week, so it'll be interesting to see if the Bulls can build on this momentum next week.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
