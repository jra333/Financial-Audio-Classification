NEUT0|"""So I feel like it today was a day of discounts I bought into ride."
NEUT1|Now I bought in 80 shares of Ride.
NEUT2|Was looking to buy 100 but decided to hold back on the last 20 so that I can average down with Rocket.
BULL3|But that's a different story, but ride definitely showed me a lot of potential.
NEUT4|If you want to see exactly what ride has done in the last couple of months, let's look at six months and you could see that as we start to look at this and you start to really look at this here you can see up down, up, down, up down.
NEUT5|It's really a swing traders dream and now we're starting to get to a point to where it's at.
NEUT6|Brand new lows and if it's at those lows, that means it can do nothing but go up.
BEAR7|It's going to bounce off of those lows, bounce off that support level, and end up skyrocketing.
BULL8|So it's hitting these support levels probably of 18, you know, 2125 maybe even 30.
NEUT9|And that's where I'm looking to actually gain my profits.
NEUT10|Probably set some sort of stop loss, maybe at 25, or probably at 18, and then take my profits there.
NEUT11|But ride looks like a great opportunity in my opinion, so that's why I put.
NEUT12|"You know, basically bought 80 shares."""
