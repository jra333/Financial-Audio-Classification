NEUT0|"""10.43% So what?"
NEUT1|What happened over here?
BULL2|What made Disney Spike up 10.43%?
NEUT3|Would it turns out that actually Disney's releasing?
NEUT4|A streaming service word L stream.
NEUT5|It'll be like a Netflix, but a Disney version where you can stream all the Disney flicks that you want.
NEUT6|This is pretty cool.
NEUT7|I mean, imagine all the content that Disney has.
NEUT8|Just think about Disney and all the movies Disney has made.
NEUT9|I mean Pirates of the Caribbean and so many Disney just owned so much product.
NEUT10|So much product.
NEUT11|You know of so Disney Disney has a lot of classics.
NEUT12|Lion King, Aladdin, Disney has all that stuff so.
NEUT13|This 10% is because of the streaming service that Disney is has been.
NEUT14|The media has been actually making a fuss about.
BULL15|Now when we look at the past month, Disney has been going to 15%.
NEUT16|When we look at the three months, 16.64% we will look at the one year.
BULL17|It's up 28.436%.
BEAR18|Now subscribers check this out subscribers now when you look at during December 21st, there was a huge decline in the market.
NEUT19|So right now we're we're in a bull.
BEAR20|We're in a bull run right now.
NEUT21|Essentially so now look at how low Disney went when it was.
NEUT22|When we were in a down market in December 24, around December 21st right here so.
BEAR23|December 24th, it was down down.
BEAR24|Only down, not even 1%, but.
BEAR25|If it falls back down to where it was in December 21st, which was only four months ago, then we would be looking at a 30% decline so.
NEUT26|So keep that in mind guys.
NEUT27|Now when you look at the five year five year chart, we can actually say that every time Disney spiked in the past, like right around here.
NEUT28|If collapse it fell like look it went up to 118 and then it fell down right over here went up again and then it fell down and then Disney was kind of.
NEUT29|If you look at it it's been kind of sideways.
NEUT30|So just by looking at this right here.
NEUT31|I can see that maybe maybe Disney looks a little over overvalued right now, but.
NEUT32|A streaming service can make a lot of money, especially if they take all the customers from Netflix and Netflix goes out of business then.
BEAR33|This then this would be an undervalued company.
NEUT34|Essentially.
BULL35|Now when we look at the volume, we got a pretty decent volume at 5,000,000.
BULL36|It's it's a good volume, but it's not as high as average volume at 9 million.
NEUT37|So for some reason there's not as much trading going on now.
BEAR38|When you look at the 52 week low, we're actually down only to $97.00 at a 52 week low.
BULL39|Right now we're actually at the 52 week high.
NEUT40|That's why we could see the two week highs, or $132.
NEUT41|"We're pretty close to that, so we look at the market cap, the market cap, close to 200 billion."""
