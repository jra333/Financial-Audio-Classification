NEUT0|"""Is the weakness this morning about DC or is this about City and Jeffries talking about 2% ten year at year end?"
NEUT1|Well, I think that there's overseas.
BEAR2|The market turned down pretty violently.
NEUT3|Not really.
NEUT4|Reflection of us.
NEUT5|I think that markets McKean on a couple of things.
NEUT6|Tesla Mickey want oil been keen on the bond market.
NEUT7|Obviously an if I see these things turn around, I would be more bullish.
NEUT8|But I think it's a consolidation.
NEUT9|And when you listen to the Speaker of the House of 60 minutes last night.
NEUT10|Basically, just saying in the presence of the most dangerous man you got a week of danger and the markets don't like that.
NEUT11|Yeah, you know, we talked about election risk going into the vote in November and actually in October, right?
NEUT12|We were.
NEUT13|We were reading the notes from JP Morgan and Symbolist in the argument at the time, or the worry at the time was that AG Barr would impound election results and we would truly have dueling inaugurations, but with the President committing to an orderly transition, I mean how do we describe election risk?
NEUT14|Or, I guess, inauguration risk at this point?
NEUT15|Well, I think that there's a number of people.
BULL16|There's an undercurrent.
NEUT17|That, I think, is at this point pretty legitimate because we listen to what's going on.
NEUT18|Find out with some Facebook that there was a inside job, and I think there are a lot of people in America who believe that something happened and we need to know what really happened in the capital before we can make a judgment.
NEUT19|What's going to happen?
BEAR20|Integration this stories do seem to indicate that there was some critical gaps this weekend.
NEUT21|On Wednesday.
NEUT22|The stories this weekend made you feel like, OK, we really don't know what happened, and I think that level of uncertainty makes it so that we don't.
NEUT23|You know what's going to happen?
BULL24|Inauguration, obviously they're going to be better prepared.
NEUT25|It would just be terrible if they weren't, but I think that we need.
NEUT26|I'm waiting for Merrick Garland to come out and say OK, listen, the first thing we do is is have a Commission.
NEUT27|Figure out what happened that day.
NEUT28|And then I also think that Biden has to come out and say listen, we need to figure out what's going on with the vaccine.
BEAR29|These are things that are really worrisome.
BEAR30|Carl the number of caseload is just incredible.
NEUT31|What really happened on Wednesday?
BEAR32|Very uncertain impeachment.
NEUT33|Or is that crazy?
NEUT34|We don't know.
NEUT35|And then on top of that we have the tenure.
NEUT36|But I do think that it's Washington that's in control an it won't be in control 10 days from now.
NEUT37|But we gotta get there.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
