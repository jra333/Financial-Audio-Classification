BULL0|"""Hello good morning everybody."
NEUT1|I'm saying good morning because I literally just woke up.
NEUT2|Yeah, I'm far from bullish guys.
BEAR3|Like really, really far from bullish.
NEUT4|But we gotta keep in mind that tomorrow's pro shares ETF could be approved or denied by the SEC.
NEUT5|If it's approved, expect this prices just skyrocket.
NEUT6|If it's denied, it's going to be bad guys.
BEAR7|Expect the price to go down.
NEUT8|So yesterday was an artificial pump according to lots of news sources where they think the price was artificially pumped up, because I will basically during the shutdown maintenance of a bit next right Quince idents will see, so I think a lot of bigger investors.
NEUT9|Right now we're just waiting on the sidelines for a more credible pump.
NEUT10|This is not a real rally guys.
NEUT11|Not only that, this is clearly clearly 123 going upwards right?
BEAR12|And I was mentioning that we have to retrace to very bullish level of like I don't know around 6600 and if we got to 6400 range is all bullishness completely off the table right?
NEUT13|What could argue at a lower time frame right?
NEUT14|That this is 1231234 and five but not.
NEUT15|This is supposed to be 1234 and five so this actually makes some wave one right here OK?
NEUT16|This makes some waves one right there.
NEUT17|That's two, right?
NEUT18|This is basically three and I was expecting a four somewhere right?
NEUT19|I was expecting a four and they go up, but now that we've actually retraced directly into this territory were completely back to where we were guys completely back to where we were.
NEUT20|So how could we assume any type of bullishness whatsoever?
NEUT21|This is going to be a like look at this look at this massively engulfing bearish candle.
NEUT22|Guys, OK?
NEUT23|It completely engulfed in a bearishly engulfing candle is when the next candle is like this exactly right.
NEUT24|This right here, the body just completely took it over, and that is never a good sign whatsoever.
NEUT25|But we had that kind of rally followed by a long Wick and then a body that also rejects.
NEUT26|Like.
NEUT27|Think about this guys, we went up one day 500 and we went back the next day 500 as well.
NEUT28|So hang tight guys it's going to be a crazy ride today and tomorrow.
NEUT29|"That we're going to wait till the ETF approves or denies."""
