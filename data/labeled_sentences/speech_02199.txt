BULL0|"""Hey guys, just giving you hot stock girl today."
NEUT1|I'm going to discuss Costco.
NEUT2|The ticker symbol is COST Costco's roots date back to 1976 when the father and son team of Sol and Robert Price opened the Price Club.
NEUT3|Warehouse Coffee was officially started in 1983 by founders James Siegel and Jeffrey Brotman.
NEUT4|Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 and there are now 761 warehouses throughout the world.
NEUT5|Costco now has.
BEAR6|Over $141 billion in yearly revenue trailing children Deborah of $5.8 billion in a market cap of around $100 billion.
BULL7|Costco investors had a great run in the long term chart shows a stock that keeps going up.
NEUT8|So is there still time to make money in Costco if you buy it today?
NEUT9|Well, I wouldn't bet against them.
NEUT10|Costco is a very well run Corporation at 17 * A bra.
NEUT11|It has a rich valuation that is.
NEUT12|A little high when you factor in the revenue and earnings growth rates over the past few years, the key is can Costco maintain its growth rate?
BULL13|Costco's warehouses are in almost all of the major marketing in the US and those should be able to grow sales roughly in line with the GDP growth rate to grow faster than the overall economy, Costco will need to drive higher online sales and expand internationally.
NEUT14|Costco's e-commerce sales account for about 3% of their total sales.
BULL15|So at the moment they are not significant, even if on line sales grow 20% right now it would only improve overall sales by less than 1%.
BEAR16|Which won't help much.
NEUT17|Part of Costco's appeal is going to the store and touching the merchandise.
NEUT18|So I don't see Costco's in major online player right now.
BULL19|I see Amazon with a large lead in online sales and though eBay is second, I think Mama Ropas eBay in the future, Costco's international sales contribute about 23% of the total revenues and I think the international growth is a big part of Costco's future international store growth should.
NEUT20|Keep Costco busy for the next few years.
NEUT21|Costco competitor BJ's Wholesale recently went public again and trades at a discount to Costco at only 11 times EBIT da.
NEUT22|I don't think BJ's is a threat to Costco's dominance, so BJ's should continue to treat at a discount.
NEUT23|I also don't see Wal-Mart's Sam's Club's as much of a threat either.
NEUT24|Costco looks fairly valued to me right now.
NEUT25|I wouldn't buy it here and I wouldn't short it.
NEUT26|Sometimes.
NEUT27|Great companies trade at a price that doesn't make it a great stopped.
BEAR28|Known for its feature returns now if Costco were to drop back near $150 per share, I would definitely consider buying the stock.
NEUT29|If the fundamentals hadn't changed, haven't changed so there you have it.
NEUT30|My thoughts on Costco?
NEUT31|I'm getting hot stock, Rowan.
