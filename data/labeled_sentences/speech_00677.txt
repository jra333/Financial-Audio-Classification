BULL0|"""Yeah, I mean well, I'm thrilled for them and it's it's it's great news."
NEUT1|If you're an investor, aorta companies is hard to fathom difference in terms of valuation of this company more than doubling overnight.
NEUT2|They're obviously not twice as good as they were valuable as they were, you know, 24 hours, 48 hours ago, but you know, it makes for exciting TV.
NEUT3|It certainly does.
NEUT4|And profitable investments, I guess, as you mentioned, the top Bradley does this now spur on?
NEUT5|Any other company that's been vaguely considering an IPO that operates in this space?
NEUT6|Does it spur them on to get their IPO going as soon as possible?
NEUT7|And when that happens, do we start to get to the position where supply outdoes demand?
BULL8|Yeah, I mean it may be not unlike what we've seen in the stock market where there was a huge demand for Spanish and and they all did really, really well.
NEUT9|And now you're starting to see some facts people be pulled back or maybe not even the phrase with the need to raise simply because it supplies sorted.
NEUT10|Really asked the demand.
NEUT11|So that is definitely possible.
BULL12|With that said, if no macro standpoint through them over the market is saying is we're happy in the way things are going in Washington now.
NEUT13|And the way they're going to go, we're happy that the vaccine is here, and so those conditions should exist for awhile.
NEUT14|So if you are a tech company with something really valuable to offer the market, and you were planning on public anyway in the next 812 months, yeah, it might make sense to move fast.
NEUT15|What do you think Bradley Airbnb needs to do to hang on to this 100 plus billion dollar valuation?
NEUT16|Yeah, I mean, I'm not sure there's anything they can do to hang on to that because it's run by very smart.
NEUT17|People have been working very hard for the last 12 years or so, so it's not with all of a sudden.
NEUT18|But you know what, what?
BULL19|What is good for them is obviously now that people are starting to see the vaccine.
NEUT20|Different parts around the World Travel will resume again, and you could also see a possibility where once some people have the vaccine, not others, they're not only willing to travel, but they feel safer staying in an air BNB.
NEUT21|Then they might not hotel.
BULL22|I'm at the result in a real spike, so that may be enough at least to have you know decent numbers for the next quarter to kind of keep the stock price moving.
NEUT23|But it's hard to imagine standing.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
