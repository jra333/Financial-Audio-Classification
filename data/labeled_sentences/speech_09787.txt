BULL0|"""Joining us now to explain his Mike Novogratz Galaxy Digital CEO Mike it's great to see you."
NEUT1|What I can understand about what's happening really even over the past two weeks is the move in Bitcoin against the backdrop of what appears to be an effort by Mnuchin.
NEUT2|On his way out to effectively regulate a good part of this business.
NEUT3|And people like Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and others saying this is a real problem.
BULL4|And yet the price keeps moving higher.
NEUT5|Square the circle that tells you about how powerful this bull market is right there, throwing lots at the system.
NEUT6|And it's not actually impacting it, but let's be careful.
NEUT7|You know, these regulations really are hitting the stable coin market and they're hitting.
NEUT8|They're not actually designed to go after Bitcoin and therium per say.
NEUT9|They are designed to offer the companies that traffic in there, and those are mostly companies with retail, so in Galaxy, nothing changes.
NEUT10|We've KYC emailed all our clients that we have institutional clients, and so we've got this institutional wave of money coming into crypto right.
NEUT11|Mass mutual insurance company buys 100,000,000 for their general account.
NEUT12|That's giant news, right?
NEUT13|That that needs to get approved by the Fed and by the insurance regulator.
BEAR14|And so we're seeing no slowdown in the adoption of Bitcoin specifically with our institutional clients.
NEUT15|It is, I mean Mnuchin put on the Grinch and like you know two weeks before he's leaving, he decides to be the Grinch.
NEUT16|This stuff should have proper 60 day comment period.
NEUT17|It's it's kind of endemic of the Trump administration, trying to jam in legislation.
NEUT18|And quite frankly, there are a lot of unintended consequences.
NEUT19|This is anti dollar rate is pro China in lots of ways and it's anti innovation is going to push a lot of the cool stuff that's happening in crypto offshore.
NEUT20|The other thing to think about when you step back is you know think about Travis Kalanick with Uber right?
NEUT21|In order for him to get Uber done he smashed regulations, state regulations, city regulations have even banned in the Hamptons and at one point consumers demanded over and you know he kind of.
NEUT22|Push push the edge of the envelope.
NEUT23|We can't do that.
NEUT24|A Galaxy were regulated entity, but lots of these crypto companies both onshore and offshore, are willing to push regulation and build great innovation.
NEUT25|I would love an administration.
NEUT26|I would love a regulatory framework that embraces that not fights that.
NEUT27|I'm hoping to change the garden 20 days.
NEUT28|I'm hoping we get some more open minded regulate.
NEUT29|Mike, if we were having that, we have the same conversation a year from today.
NEUT30|So Christmas Eve 2021.
NEUT31|The upside in your mind from where the price of Bitcoin could be and the downside of what the price could be.
NEUT32|Bitcoin right now is about 3% of gold.
NEUT33|I think it can easily be 10% of gold, so that's 6065 thousand 60,000.
NEUT34|I don't think that's hard.
BULL35|I just see that many new participants coming into the market listen.
NEUT36|The downside.
BEAR37|I'd be really upset if it was below 14,500.
NEUT38|That would probably mean.
BULL39|On a good sense that the economy is roared back much faster than people thought, right?
BULL40|Vaccine comes huge surge of the economy.
NEUT41|And whoever is running the Fed chairman.
BEAR42|Powell's successor says, oops, maybe we were a little too pessimistic and maybe we're going to have to raise rates sooner.
BEAR43|At that point, I think all assets are going to come lower.
NEUT44|It's not my base case by any stretch, but I always try to think about what's the ballet that could could derail this equity bull market rally.
NEUT45|And this this rally in Bitcoin.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
