NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, it's Giacomo speaking."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this quick video on General Electric stock.
NEUT2|So in front of us there is one hour candle stick and as we can see prices been moving sideways or example it seems just since March it's a relative since the big middle end of March and the idea is that those prices will keep moving being keep moving inside the channel.
NEUT3|Until now there are good news.
NEUT4|I believe around this new election with the.
NEUT5|By then the new president that of course it will be trying.
NEUT6|I'm sure that he will.
BULL7|He will have a better relationship with China and with the Asia GE generator case, a lot of businesses in Asia.
BEAR8|So I think that this talk if in the next days the price will close a border 8 U.S. dollar per share.
NEUT9|This talk can really go.
NEUT10|Up to 10 U.S. dollars and you can start again.
BULL11|The new rally up to its previous value before the virus of 13 U.S. dollar.
NEUT12|So the idea is using just using a very simple channel.
NEUT13|Terry, this is the depth or the height of the channel and to to find the new target price is just to put the projection of this depth from the break out of the.
NEUT14|All the residents level so break out there.
NEUT15|So just those two elements.
NEUT16|They have the same depth of the same height and we have found this target price of 10 U.S. dollar generally support the resistance target eyes are always round numbers.
NEUT17|Technical analysis run numbers are very important and the target price you have to set the target price always a little bit below the run around the round Number.
NEUT18|So perhaps 9 point 89.9.
NEUT19|Not set it up or directly on technology, but anyway, so the idea is to go long on.
NEUT20|If in the next days two days even one day, because this one is already being closed, it's already 8.10 at least Monday and Tuesday.
NEUT21|Both those two days, the stock will close aboard this residence level.
NEUT22|Lydia is to go along with the target price of the US dollar.
NEUT23|This is my understanding and interpretation of this talk, but just please read a lot of news and try to combine always technical and fundamental.
BULL24|"Nice thanks bye."""
