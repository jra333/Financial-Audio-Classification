NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 24th of February 2021.
NEUT2|Wednesday.
BULL3|Today after week we're at #20 crypto.com coin, in particular CR or so for the past seven days crypto.com coin went on the rampage towards the upside.
BULL4|Right now we had a super big recovery against USD against BS against BTC.
BEAR5|We're still down in the dumpsters.
NEUT6|Yes Sir.
BEAR7|We're still under the skinny pink line and so the trend remains bearish for CRO against BTC we remain.
BEAR8|Bias bearish for CRO against BTC yes yes, yes they also spike.
NEUT9|But then again this is not what I would consider as a reversal chart pattern.
BULL10|If we go on an accumulation adventure first then as a skinny pink line comes on potentially towards the middle of the year or the second half of 2021, you might see a proper recovery coming on.
NEUT11|I mean come in for CRO against BTC again at this point of time we are just purely.
NEUT12|Guessing for CR against BTC, no clear reversal chart patterns coming on for CRO against BTC, not at this point of time.
NEUT13|So be very careful about going to a trade too soon for CR against BTC.
NEUT14|Could we have predicted this move coming in for CR?
NEUT15|Oh know know know any tricks for CRA at all at this point?
NEUT16|No, we could not have predicted this, so this was a super surprised that came in by the team of CR.
NEUT17|Oh yeah, they had.
BULL18|Super huge burn of Arciero tokens so that actually Slingshot the price towards the moon against US DT.
NEUT19|But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about the arrow in the comments below.
BULL20|40 against your city, we actually had a target here.
BEAR21|At 4.9 cents, we were anticipating it to break $0.05, but eventually it did not break now.
NEUT22|So what happened is we slice back through above.
NEUT23|This can't be crying.
NEUT24|So things are switching bullish force heroes.
NEUT25|We're just going to remove all our drawings and we're going to start things fresh.
NEUT26|Could we have predicted this move coming in for CR?
NEUT27|Oh no, we could not have.
NEUT28|This does look like a rising rising channel, right?
NEUT29|Looks like a bear flag and usually bear flex.
BULL30|Our trend continuation, but for this case here because the Siaro team did something amazing, they burned.
NEUT31|I think 70 million or billion tokens, zero tokens, and then it kind of blasted off the price towards the moon.
NEUT32|Is this a new all time high?
BULL33|Here we almost hit a new all time high on Hobie.
BULL34|Yeah, but this is potentially a big bullish move coming on.
NEUT35|Are we going to continue this bullish move for Siaro potentially potentially?
NEUT36|But then again, I don't see any clear tradeable Titans 40 yet for those.
BEAR37|We have accumulated zero at the very bottom over here.
BULL38|Good job.
NEUT39|And so yeah, I think the training switch English is very important there.
NEUT40|SRL stays above the skinny pink line we slept through it, and it's very important that we stay above it.
NEUT41|Even if you do fall and we correct any lower, we must not touch this keeping playing because potentially it could still drop back under the skin implant, which is not what we want to see, right?
NEUT42|We want to see accumulation and then pump.
BULL43|We go higher, right consolidation.
NEUT44|But then again it is still too early to call continuation.
NEUT45|We don't know how much lower things are going to go and so be very very careful.
NEUT46|About going to a trade for CR.
NEUT47|Alright, I guess you say from my sorrow technical analysis.
BULL48|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL49|I hope you enjoyed it as well.
NEUT50|"See you in the next video."""
