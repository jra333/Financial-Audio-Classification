NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, it's John McCain."
BULL1|Thanks for joining me watching this video quick update on Apple and based on fundamental analysis the where the earnings reports went good with adding per share of two point.
BULL2|$55 was last week and even the revenue was good.
NEUT3|No as good as believe the previous year and the problem is not this quarter but it's gonna be the next quarter or the next month's all the initial market is.
BEAR4|Being impacted by virus by the virus by even the western side of the world is being backed by the virus, mainly in the Asia side.
BEAR5|Because Apple's factories in Asia so and it might be a problem for the development of the new, the new iPhones and Mac book from the Good news from the Good News point of view, there is a new MacBook MacBook just issued this map this morning Monday.
NEUT6|And so it seems that Apple is keeps working and keeps issuing new amount that so.
BULL7|So it seems that the market key keeps going up.
BULL8|In fact, as we can see from the technical analysis, the market seems to be bullish.
NEUT9|There is a channel line, the price is moving.
NEUT10|The prices are moving between those those channel line.
NEUT11|This is one hour chart again and based on fundamental analysis and some technical analysis to market my jump up to this price 3/3 and 10 U.S. dollars.
NEUT12|Some.
NEUT13|Analyst, they believe that the price can go up to 320, but I would consider as first step $310 and then we can go up to 320.
NEUT14|So the idea is that this market should go up and as shown in this in this up trained condition, even if the Mac D is the Mac, D is showing it's up on upside, so it's it's bullish.
BEAR15|It's bullish condition.
NEUT16|But you know it's it's.
BULL17|It's starting going down, so hopefully is that it will go up again about anyway.
BULL18|So I see this right now taking analysis is end due to this channel line the market should bounce up to this level as I told you some analysts, they believe 320.
NEUT19|I think's first step is 310.
NEUT20|So overall anyway taking analysis and price movements.
BULL21|Just telling us that the market is bullish and it seems that it will keep going up.
NEUT22|So this is this update on Apple and this is very important.
NEUT23|'cause then I'm going to analyze the SP 500 and our police one of them in stock of ACP.
