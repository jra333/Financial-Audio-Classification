NEUT0|"""Yo, when Christine was going on it is January 22nd, 2021 and the market is officially closed."
NEUT1|Looking at things right now, the chart in front of you is SPX.
NEUT2|That is the S&P 500 index.
NEUT3|So continue on from what we were at last week.
BEAR4|I was looking for the market to kind of continue to stall an.
NEUT5|Didn't really do that.
BULL6|It kind of moved a little higher.
NEUT7|It did the grind higher, so if you recall from October where I was looking at things to.
NEUT8|Eventually make his way up to 3800.
BULL9|I was saying it would grind higher and so far it is doing just that.
NEUT10|So if we take a look at the chart now, we see all the levels that we have put in place and we see our twenty day moving average every time it's made it.
NEUT11|There is made a bounce so made a balance there, made a bounce there.
BULL12|This is the one from last week we were looking at it and now it pushed to a new high.
NEUT13|So the high.
NEUT14|Is 38 sixty 145.
NEUT15|And today we closed at 3841.
BEAR16|47 So that's pretty close an as I've referenced before, a close towards the high is usually a continuation signal.
NEUT17|So what I'm looking for next week is for the market to continue, so that is my outlook for the SMP.
NEUT18|Let's go ahead and check out the Russell ticker IWM.
NEUT19|I have not updated the levels on here, but I will.
NEUT20|We can do so live as a matter of fact, so let's go down here.
NEUT21|Put our levels.
NEUT22|And start to look at this.
NEUT23|Alright, so we see, here's the first level where we have some hesitation.
NEUT24|The next level is going to be here, and that's their first level.
NEUT25|Next level is here where we made this high.
NEUT26|There's another and here's the next level.
NEUT27|We have some hesitation.
NEUT28|There we go, so there are or our new levels and what I'm looking for is for this to make a push towards 220.
NEUT29|So I'm looking for next week to potentially move higher and that is my analysis for this week, don't forget.
