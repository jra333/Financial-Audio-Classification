BEAR0|"""What's up folks?"
NEUT1|Johnny Red here from transparent traders.
NEUT2|Today I wanted to talk to you about stock ticker DIS.
NEUT3|That's the Walt Disney company.
NEUT4|Everybody knows who Disney is Disney, plus the theme parks all the Disney characters, movies, you name it.
NEUT5|They got it.
NEUT6|OK, so we're going to talk about this right here, which is weekly email alerts that comes with your subscription to the TT Black Box.
NEUT7|We send these out on Saturday evening.
NEUT8|And we're going to talk about the one for Disney.
NEUT9|So as you can see, Disney was alerted this past Saturday on 1/10.
BEAR10|2021 as a bearish swing trade.
BEAR11|I'm looking for entry once it breaks below $174.70.
NEUT12|Must stop.
NEUT13|Will be one 7945 in my target price and looking for his one 6080 so I took this as a swing trade.
NEUT14|Yesterday I entered this and then I sold out around lunchtime today so I'm going to pull up the chart on Tradingview.
NEUT15|Ann will go through this and show you the breakdown.
BULL16|Surging see, I have stock ticker Disp pulled up on the trading view charts.
NEUT17|Right here is the green line.
NEUT18|This is our target entry one 7470 and as you can see down here, this red line at 171 thirties, four is where I exited the trade today.
BEAR19|So this is a easy almost 3 1/2 point drop.
NEUT20|As you can see here.
NEUT21|Yesterday on Thursday so you can see this is the 15th.
NEUT22|So this is today starts right here in premarket.
NEUT23|This is yesterday, so as you can see, close to around approximately around 1:32 o'clock.
NEUT24|It entered in.
NEUT25|I got in probably about 174 fifty I think is what my exact entry price was, and then I just held this throughout.
BEAR26|After hour trading in premarket and then once the market open we just dropped huge big three point drop.
NEUT27|I held it from all the way into about right here approximately about 10:30.
NEUT28|And then I cut it.
NEUT29|And.
NEUT30|My average was one 7134.
BULL31|So there you have it, traders another successful swing trade from shorting Disney Agency right here.
