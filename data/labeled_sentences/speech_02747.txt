BULL3|I think Tesla is going to do well on earnings.
NEUT4|They're not going to disappoint.
BULL5|Apple is going to be a massive winner for earnings.
BEAR6|OK, now another big winner for earnings, but it's far off.

NEUT8|I own Wayfair, OK. Wayfair is the only competitor Amazon has in home decor and home furnishings.
NEUT9|Like furniture, they will do very, very well.
NEUT10|I watched their last earnings, they blew up into earnings.
BEAR11|Had a great report and then the stock dumped anyway.
NEUT12|So now what we do is I'm in this already.
NEUT13|I run it up till earnings an I get out before.
NEUT14|I will probably stay in Apple with so long term hold.
NEUT15|Tesla is a sketchy one.
NEUT16|But Tesla is not fueled by any.
NEUT17|Fundamentals was, however, Tesla is fueled by people who just love and believe in Tesla.
NEUT18|What we call the Robin Hood generation OK, and this stock will run all E1 has to do is come up and say that he's working on the next million mile million year battery.

NEUT24|I don't touch Netflix.
NEUT25|If you're going to do anything with Netflix, you short the **** out of this.
NEUT26|OK, last earnings.
NEUT27|I sold my Netflix at a little over.

NEUT29|OK, you have to understand the situation with Netflix OK?
NEUT30|They from they don't make anymore money.
NEUT31|Let's look at the last five days.
NEUT32|So the last month.
NEUT33|So now last month you can see here OK.
NEUT34|They've been running.
NEUT35|Don't forget earnings or every quarter.
NEUT36|OK, so it's pretty much every four months now.
NEUT37|Uhm?
NEUT38|So when we look at this right?
NEUT39|But three months, whatever it is, when we look at this, usually the earnings run, you have the the earnings big run into it, then the dump it settles out and then you set up for next earnings and run up again.
NEUT40|I want you to watch Netflix tomorrow when you look at the price.
