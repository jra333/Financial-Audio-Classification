BULL0|"""People flock from all over the world to hear Warren Buffett's investment wisdom."
NEUT1|It's why they call him the Oracle of Omaha.
NEUT2|After five decades of success, his investment vehicle, Berkshire Hathaway, is one of the largest companies on the planet.
NEUT3|For many years, Berkshire was most famous for its collection of stock market investments.
NEUT4|Shares in the likes of Coca Cola and American Express.
NEUT5|But it's been buying whole businesses too since the very beginning.
NEUT6|After all, why buy a minority shareholding if you could afford the whole company?
NEUT7|As Buffett says, quoting Mae West too much of a good thing is wonderful.
NEUT8|The Oracle of Omaha deserves a second nickname.
NEUT9|The conglomerate King.
NEUT10|Berkshire was actually an historic name in textile manufacturing when Buffett took control in 1965, but he didn't plan to reinvest its profits in a declining industry.
NEUT11|The money went instead into the stock market and into a 50 year acquisition spree that's accelerated in recent years.
NEUT12|There have been insurers, chocolate makers, newspapers, retailers, private jets manufacturers, other conglomerates, giant power companies recently.
NEUT13|And North America's major railway.
NEUT14|Be NSF.
NEUT15|To top it off.
NEUT16|Beyond his investing prowess, there are a couple of extra secrets to Berkshire's success.
NEUT17|The power of the float.
NEUT18|And the power of compound returns.
NEUT19|There's a reason Berkshire's first acquisitions were insurance companies.
NEUT20|Insurance premiums are effectively a free loan.
NEUT21|You don't have to pay any interest, just make sure you don't pay out too much in claims.
NEUT22|These premiums are known as the float and they act like leverage for an investment portfolio.
NEUT23|So for five decades, Buffett has been investing the world's cheapest money.
NEUT24|Even today, insurance is the heart of Berkshire.
NEUT25|It's one of the biggest global reinsurers.
NEUT26|It's expanding in commercial insurance and it owns GEICO, whose cute mascot has the most famous English accent in U.S. TV commercials.
NEUT27|This is where Buffett's got after 50 years investing.
NEUT28|The profits from all Berkshires businesses, plus that extra money from the insurance float.
NEUT29|By compounding returns, you only have to beat the market a little bit.
NEUT30|Most years to make a huge difference.
NEUT31|Overtime beat the market a lot for 50 years and you 2 might become the conglomerate King.
NEUT32|But can Berkshire possibly keep growing now?
BEAR33|It's gotten so big?
NEUT34|And does such an eclectic collection of businesses belong under one roof?
NEUT35|Will present or future shareholders turn against its size and its unusual structure?
NEUT36|And what will happen as Buffett's heirs loosen their grip.
NEUT37|These are the central questions as Buffett celebrates his Golden anniversary.
NEUT38|"Does the conglomerate outlive the conglomerate King?"""
