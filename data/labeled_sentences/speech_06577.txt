BEAR0|"""For your article came out Amazon suddenly 57% of the product you were writing about they're gone, or they've been."
NEUT1|The wordings been changed right exactly after we sent Amazon.
NEUT2|The list of products that we identified.
NEUT3|They updated or took down many of the listings or made sure they were taking something that you're saying they should have been doing anyway, right?
NEUT4|So I saw it both ways.
NEUT5|They were either ceding control to the third party sellers or they lost control.
NEUT6|Which is it?
NEUT7|Well, it's hard to say.
NEUT8|I mean, the platform is so large I think anybody would be hard pressed to.
BEAR9|Police it affectively but we talked to many former employees and safety experts who said that there's some obvious holes in the way that their machine learning tools that they rely on to police their site allows allows dangerous and banned products to slip through the cracks.
NEUT10|You know I didn't.
NEUT11|I was flipping through the piece over the weekend and I know I've seen some of the headlines about it and was already thinking about it.
NEUT12|And when I realized one of the main things you're featuring with something I ordered for my son a couple months ago when he was having trouble sleeping, it was that side sleeper.
NEUT13|I had no idea this is a band product.
NEUT14|I just heard a recommendation.
NEUT15|Hey try this thing, I got it on Amazon.
NEUT16|You bought it from a third party seller.
NEUT17|I can't.
NEUT18|I don't even know.
NEUT19|I just think about it as I bought it from Amazon and I'm I'm more aware now as you said with the data, 60% of their merchandise sales are now third party sellers, up from 30% and I'm sure I'm not the only one who's realized there's a big difference in quality and trustworthiness from buying something on Amazon today than there might have been even five years ago.
NEUT20|It's not as if you're buying from a big box store.
NEUT21|Amazon has changed a lot, for sure.
NEUT22|And they've relied more on 3rd party vendors and as they opened their site up to third party vendors, you know it still looks very much like Amazon is selling you the product like they used to and now they even have the fulfillment by Amazon program which allows the third party sellers to ship the product's to an Amazon warehouse where they are then put in an Amazon package and delivered to your doorstep, arriving in Amazon branded packages.
NEUT23|They might even advertise their latest TV show, so it's a very transparent process.
NEUT24|So unless you're very careful and you're looking to see in the small text to see.
NEUT25|You know, maybe it's fulfilled by Amazon and sold by the name of the third party there.
NEUT26|And we're not talking about the backwaters of the of the website.
NEUT27|This is a major component of Amazon sales.
NEUT28|The third party sellers, and many of these items are actually featured as Amazon's choice for those product categories.
NEUT29|Yeah, yeah, exactly, we did do a little bit of additional testing for some of these images on Amazon's Choice products.
NEUT30|We actually purchased 10 products, many of them were Amazon's choice, and we sent them to federally certified labs.
BEAR31|An forum came back with safety issues.
NEUT32|The other thing that is interesting about this is it's an end run for Amazon around.
NEUT33|I don't want to say the legal system, but if you have a demand for product like I did, I get on Amazon.
NEUT34|I can.
NEUT35|It's readily available for me.
NEUT36|I could not have gotten that in stores.
NEUT37|How much merchandise?
NEUT38|How much Commerce is happening on their platform that would not be allowed elsewhere?
NEUT39|Yeah, I mean, we only identified thousands of products, you know.
NEUT40|And we were looking at very specific categories and these had everything to do with labeling issues that in their current form would not be sold.
NEUT41|On a store shelf, that way all the way to things that are dangerous that the governments called dangerous, like the sleeping mats that you mentioned to even we found motorcycle helmets that had been recalled that after the recall they were still for sale on the side are still listed on the site anyway.
BEAR42|You're going to keep it well I guess not.
NEUT43|I mean if it's severe enough that it would be not allowed to be sold in the store, then of course I'd think twice about a product that otherwise I might just think.
NEUT44|Well, I have to be a little careful with.
NEUT45|"Let me tell you something that caught my attention right away."""
