BULL0|"""Air B&B shares yesterday doubled more than doubled after their market debut, the Rising again today, by the way."
NEUT1|But there are just about 2% in today's session, but that gives them our company in market cap of close to $90 billion.
NEUT2|DoorDash of course, also had a big IPO.
BEAR3|So as we get to the end of the week here and we take a look back, I am reminded of a conversation and something that Miles has been reminding me of an A little bit of a dispute that we had the other day.
NEUT4|Where I questioned these valuations and Myles very reasonably pointed out that a lot of these companies, their strategy is they just don't sell a lot of shares to the public, so most of the float, the float that there is, is not the bulk of the company's shares outstanding, so that's something that came is sort of a technical thing that can affect the demand for these shares miles.
NEUT5|I mean, I guess.
NEUT6|How sustained, though I wonder, can that affect be at some point I wondered, will they sell more shares to the public?
NEUT7|And what effect will that have as we as we look down the line?
BEAR8|Yeah, I mean look at everyones getting very upset about this right?
NEUT9|And I think Julie you and I you and I talked about this.
NEUT10|I believe it was with Pelotons IPO or direct listing.
NEUT11|I don't even remember how Peloton came to market, but I remember writing about the idea that Bill Gurley has, which is that everyone should direct list because then you get the quote unquote real price for your shares.
NEUT12|But then you don't make the bankers rich and everyone who flips the stock on the first day doesn't get to keep their money.
NEUT13|And you know, Bill Gurley, highly respected VC, made a lot of money smarter than me.
NEUT14|And also, who am I?
NEUT15|This is his pet.
NEUT16|Think this is all he talks about now.
NEUT17|Every time a company comes to market.
NEUT18|But to say that door Dash left a bunch of money on the table 'cause they got the stock pop on the first day.
NEUT19|Staying with Airbnb.
NEUT20|I mean it's just not really correct, right?
NEUT21|The bankers went and built a book for demand a blind book for demand for the number of shares that were being sold.
NEUT22|Which by the way is the company's decision because they don't want to go issue 20 thirty 40% of the float.
NEUT23|They don't want to loot their existing shareholder base by that amount, so.
NEUT24|What you get is an extremely popular company like Airbnb, be like door Dash coming to market with an extremely small slice of that business available to be invested in by hungry investors who yes are very excited about the market.
NEUT25|Yes, want to own this name and so we see what's happening today and to your question, but should they sell more stock absolutely right?
NEUT26|I mean your your currency is now your stock price.
BULL27|Marc Benioff has done that better than pretty much anybody and Salesforce shareholders have been rewarded, so I think.
NEUT28|It raises a lot of questions about capital markets.
NEUT29|This at the other, but here we are look DoorDash getting right sized in real time by the markets.
BEAR30|A 70% knock on their future discounted cash flows.
NEUT31|Everybody goes home happy, right?
NEUT32|Why not?
NEUT33|Well, no, not everybody goes home happy because you know what the bankers here.
NEUT34|I do think rig it against the average investor.
NEUT35|You have the average investor that's on our platform.
NEUT36|There they see these stocks going through the roof on the IPO day and what they're going to get burned when an air BNB comes out.
BEAR37|Reports of Wapping loss 31 from 3 months from now they're going to get burned.
NEUT38|When DoorDash says, you know what?
NEUT39|We're not going to be profitable until 2025, and for the average investor that just straight up stinks and I think brings us back to the core notion here the traditional.
NEUT40|Banking model doesn't make sense anymore.
BEAR41|It's broken.
NEUT42|It continues to be weighted towards the bankers and the average investor gets the shaft.
NEUT43|I do wonder how much is institutional ownership of a door, dash and air BNB and how much is individual retail investors.
NEUT44|"Hopefully will get some numbers on that as things progress."""
