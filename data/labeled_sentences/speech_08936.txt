NEUT0|"""Well, let's talk about the success you've already had that you want to build 12 of what we call controlled environment, agriculture more sites, but I've got some beautiful."
BULL1|I guess their junior beef steaks that I know are better than mine.
NEUT2|It's driving me crazy frankly because I know mine are fresh, but yours are fresh to the success you've already had.
NEUT3|Talk about it and how actually where you are is a great advantage for the rest of the country.
NEUT4|Yeah, couple of things Jim.
NEUT5|Once on the taste side will throw that to our grower team in Martha Stewart.
NEUT6|Martha will be back in Kentucky with me on Monday as well.
BULL7|The rest of our our board has been very active and helpful with me, but you know, we've really deemed this is the third wave of sustainable infrastructure.
NEUT8|20 years ago was renewable energy now 10 years ago?
NEUT9|Was electric vehicles and automotive and right now it's controlled environment agriculture.
NEUT10|We can use infrastructure and technology to grow fruit and vegetable with 90% less water.
NEUT11|Do get about 30 times yield per acre.
NEUT12|And get the harsh chemical pesticides out of the growing practice.
NEUT13|No, but where we're doing it to me is as important as how we're doing it.
NEUT14|We're doing it here in Central Appalachia, where we have an abundant amount of rainfall.
BEAR15|Five of our last 20 to 25 years on state record in Kentucky have been our wettest.
BEAR16|So you look at California drying up and drops trick in the Southwest of the US.
NEUT17|Drying up you know Mexico's continuing to have water troubles 95% of a fruit and vegetable is water, so we're just packaging up that rainwater here, using no chemicals.
NEUT18|Only filtering it with sand and UV and then growing a good healthy fruit and vegetable that we can get out to markets within a day drive.
