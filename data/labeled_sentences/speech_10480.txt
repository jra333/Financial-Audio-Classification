NEUT1|Jim from S&P 3500.
NEUT2|You got airlines, hotels, cruise lines leading and you think this is about the Avatar?
BULL3|Yeah definitely.
BEAR4|I mean, I think that we are underestimating the power of this Abbott deal.
BEAR5|There are a lot of people I think just don't really understand what's going on.
NEUT6|What's meant to be if you have fifty million tests minimum in the month of October, say, and maybe even more than that, what they're basically saying is you're going.
NEUT7|I got.
NEUT8|I downloaded the app in the app is very easy that it took me.
NEUT9|I know it took me out about 3 minutes to download the app.
NEUT10|And then it's called Navaka.
NEUT11|And what you do is just you, you get it.

NEUT34|Like the 50,000 mini clinics and you can go to any drug store and there's a mini clinic and said just go get it.
NEUT35|I mean, I'm going to probably get get tested as much as often as I can.
NEUT36|"I'd like to travel again that would be fun, like go somewhere."""
