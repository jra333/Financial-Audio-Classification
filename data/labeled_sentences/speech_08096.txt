BEAR0|"""When it comes to censorship, big Tech is making a big mistake."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times.
BEAR2|Twitter and other high tech Giants are trying to severely restrict or stamp out conservative opinion.
BEAR3|For years they have hamper door on occasion block right of center postings.
NEUT4|Now in the aftermath of that horrific mob attack on Capitol Hill last week, they have shed all pretense of objectivity and he had ambitions that censorship are gone.
BEAR5|Most egregiously, they've taken steps to destroy parlor, a relatively new competitor to Twitter, the moguls running Twitter Facebook, Amazon and others.
NEUT6|Piously claim they're against fomenting violence.
BEAR7|That's good, but in this case it's kind of laughable given the rents of murders.
NEUT8|Postings that go on touch from Chinese and Iranian propagandists, not to mention over the top posting from individuals and various organizations.
BEAR9|For example, the former CEO of Twitter last year called for the shooting of capitalists he found objectionable.
NEUT10|By the way, parlor is working hard to ferret out any violent postings, but its real sin is that it wants to be a non ideological bulletin board.
BEAR11|Big Tech is blundering here.
NEUT12|It may think it is buying protection insurance from Democrats who have won control of the White House and both houses of Congress.
BEAR13|But there only creating serious ill will that will eventually hurt them.
BEAR14|Arrogance and a public be damned attitude.
NEUT15|Always invite retribution.
NEUT16|No matter how powerful companies and organizations think they are.
BEAR17|By trying to destroy parlor and other sites, big tech will be hit with lawsuits charging him with restraint of trade.
BEAR18|Parlor is already suing Amazon.
BEAR19|Big Tex actions are providing grist for antitrust actions there fanning anger from millions of Americans who feel that big business and haughty power hungry, out of touch.
NEUT20|Politicians are attempting to marginalise or suppress them.
BEAR21|This anger and sense of alienation is not healthy for the political and cultural environment.
BEAR22|Section 230, which gives Bigtex legal immunity from lawsuits not enjoyed by traditional media companies, will be successfully attacked.
NEUT23|Years ago, the tech giant should have realized that their well-being ultimately depends on public goodwill, or at least acquiescence.
NEUT24|Decades ago 18 T was illegal telephone monopoly.
NEUT25|Ma Bell is the company was nicknamed in those days when out of its way to please one and all service was impeccable.
NEUT26|Its personnel were the essence of politeness and helpfulness.
NEUT27|Every media outlet got advertisements from AT&T.
NEUT28|All this protected it from political attack technology, not politics.
NEUT29|Ultimately broke up the old AT&T monopoly to bed.
NEUT30|Big Tech hasn't followed that model.
NEUT31|I'm Steve Forbes.
