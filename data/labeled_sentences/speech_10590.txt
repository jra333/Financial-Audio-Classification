NEUT0|"""Now let's start though Jim."
NEUT1|With this FDA report on the Pfizer data, which they're going to look at as they meet, the advisory committee meets this week.
NEUT2|I mean, it's it's one thing to hear it from Pfizer, but some of these charts are truly remarkable as the curve bends really after one dose.
BULL3|Yeah, this was big news, and I know that Doctor Gottlieb retweeted that graph, which shows you a remarkable bringing on kind of results that make me feel again that we're going to be in a situation where things are going to change rather dramatically.
BULL4|In 2021, and I think people are going to start getting ready in realize that this markets been going up because of some people recognizing that maybe things are well ahead.
BEAR5|I've got an article in my hands from Greenmantle publication out of Britain, which is there's going to be a vaccine glut in the advanced economies.
NEUT6|David a vaccine glut.
NEUT7|But wouldn't that be good news?
BULL8|Yes, that would be good news.
NEUT9|We would hope that.
NEUT10|Well, first of all, that as many people as possible can take it as quickly as possible.
BEAR11|Now we are also dealing with this news Jim, that the US government did not take an option on Pfizer's vaccine to as many doses as it might have had available.
NEUT12|Scott Gottlieb, of course, so we rely on so often.
NEUT13|And there's the story itself.
NEUT14|But Scott Gottlieb, who is a board member of Pfizer, and of course somebody that we have relied on here at CNBC throughout this pandemic.
NEUT15|For day in day out good advice spoke very candidly and you know sometimes a board member would take the 5th.
NEUT16|Basically say I'm not management.
NEUT17|He did not do that.
NEUT18|He went right at it and said yeah there was an option given to the US government.
NEUT19|It didn't take it.
NEUT20|Take a listen.
NEUT21|Pfizer did offer an additional allotment coming out of that plant.
NEUT22|Basically the second quarter allotment to the United States government multiple times, and as recently as after the interim data came out and we knew this vaccine looked to be effective.
NEUT23|I think that the government made a bet that they are going to option or advance purchase vaccines from multiple manufacturers.
NEUT24|They have agreements now with five or six manufacturers for about 100,000,000 doses each manufacturer.
NEUT25|They want to spread those bets.
NEUT26|Spread the bets Jim, as opposed to potentially it was an option.
NEUT27|That's what I don't understand.
NEUT28|It wasn't like you had to actually exercise that option and agree to it.
NEUT29|You just the option.
NEUT30|Why not take it?
NEUT31|Why not have as much available as possible?
NEUT32|Given of course he said after the interim, so you already knew there was a decent chance this thing was going to be affective.
NEUT33|Well, given what the seven, eight, 910 policy makers in the administration, wouldn't you like to know David who was on the other side of that?
NEUT34|Who said, you know what we're going to take a pass in that fantastic opportunity.
NEUT35|Because once again, what I find is that when we see something like this, we really don't know who's behind.
NEUT36|It wasn't.
NEUT37|The FDA was.
NEUT38|I don't think it was Doctor Fouchy I. I don't know who the decision-making was.
NEUT39|Now listen, we're going to have 100,000,000 doses.
NEUT40|That's fifty million.
NEUT41|Remember, you need to it, so that's still fifty million people by what first quarter?
NEUT42|That's the production, but that will get them through June.
NEUT43|The moderna.
NEUT44|I don't know where we stand on that gym, right?
NEUT45|Turns out what we've optioned or what we have from the Moderna vaccine.
NEUT46|But it was rather startling to hear Doctor Gottlieb not mince words.
NEUT47|No.
NEUT48|I'd like to know what was the president offended that they weren't part of warp speed was their indignance.
NEUT49|Was there something about Pfizer's intransigence in the sense that they said listen?
NEUT50|We can do it on our own way?
NEUT51|I mean, Carl, one of the things I'm really confident that we won't know those answers because it's it's it's time, really to try to overturn the Pennsylvania the Georgia situation.
NEUT52|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT53|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
