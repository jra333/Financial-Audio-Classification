NEUT0|"""Hey fools, welcome we're here with a closer look at BP ticker BP."
BEAR1|There's a lot of talk, a lot of people call this share dead money indeed.
NEUT2|It's actually been ahead of the Footsie in the past 30 days, but we are longer term investors here at The Motley Fool.
NEUT3|We look longer than 30 days.
NEUT4|You look a couple years out.
BEAR5|It's actually lagged.
BULL6|The Footsie 100 substantially.
NEUT7|So we're going to take a look at what's to like about BP.
NEUT8|What's not to like about pee pee in the other order?
BULL9|So Nate, thanks for being here.
NEUT10|Let's start with the Bear case for BP.
NEUT11|What what's out there that's just not to like about the company?
BEAR12|Well, the big thing is the looming fines of from that still need to be resolved from the oil spill in 2010.
BEAR13|Not inconsequential, we're talking billions of pounds that are still undecided and could still come back and haunt the company.
NEUT14|The other thing is just the natural risk that's involved in oil exploration.
NEUT15|BP is a massive oil Explorer, but it still invests heavily in very uncertain projects.
NEUT16|Deep deep ocean wells cost a lot of money, and the chances of success aren't any better for BP than they are necessarily for anybody else, so spending a lot of money to do business.
NEUT17|And do risky business.
NEUT18|Not a great formula.
NEUT19|So on the flip side, what is there to like about BP?
BULL20|Well yield over 5% is pretty attractive to most investors, especially these days.
NEUT21|The other thing that might attract income seeking investors is the company's new strategy of.
BULL22|Supposedly, better capital allocation.
BEAR23|They're cutting back on spending on major projects.
NEUT24|They're selling off assets to cover their costs.
BULL25|An increase cash flow to shareholders and their general saying they're going to take it.
NEUT26|More shareholder friendly approach of watching where they spend the money and making sure shareholders get their fair share of it.
NEUT27|OK, so I won't put you on the hook about whether this is dead money from here on out, but I will ask, do you think that the likes outweigh the dislikes?
NEUT28|Or where do you fall?
NEUT29|For me it's not a company.
NEUT30|I'm overly excited about.
NEUT31|I think the big question is, can an oil man change his spots?
NEUT32|These companies have been run BP, Shell, Exxon.
NEUT33|All these oil majors have been running for decades under the strategy of build up your reserves as big as you can to spread your risks across the globe.
NEUT34|But there's still trying to expand and grow, and that's a big cultural shift to go from.
NEUT35|Get big.
NEUT36|They get big too.
NEUT37|Oh, let's spend only where we should and make sure our shareholders get their fair share.
NEUT38|Dubious as to whether or not BB can make that turn overnight, and so I'm not not bullish on them right now.
NEUT39|And as you said, change like that in a company the size of BPS does not happen overnight, so definitely a share to keep an eye on.
BEAR40|It sounds like the like the dislikes are outweighing the likes at this point.
BULL41|"For this Motley Fool, so thanks very much for watching full line."""
