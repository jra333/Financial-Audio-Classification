BEAR0|"""Guys in this video I will be breaking down my 2020 predictions, especially with the new Year coming up."
NEUT1|I think there are some definite candidates that will definitely take off in 2020.
NEUT2|So as a new year and new decade rules around the corner, there's always been a Top Stock that greatly succeeded.
BULL3|2019 was Apple with a consistent growth of 105%.
NEUT4|You might be wondering.
NEUT5|Well, my prediction for next Amazon or Netflix would be from my analysis.
NEUT6|I believe 2020's company would be to plant based meat company.
NEUT7|Beyond meat, the ticker symbol is BYND.
NEUT8|Unless you're under a rock the entire time, you might have realized that there's been a lot of trending with keeping our earth green.
NEUT9|For example, Mr Beast, 20 million trees.
NEUT10|Those huge many influencers jumped on the opportunity.
BULL11|It was amazing.
NEUT12|Everyone is nessie.
NEUT13|Everyone unified in a way that it was also that moment of save the bees and just save the turtles too with the.
BEAR14|Metal straws frequently drop shippers out there.
NEUT15|There is rarely now, I believe 2020 will keep running with this trend and I love it.
NEUT16|You know everyone just keep the earth green, but especially for me and some of the people around me, I don't see their lifestyles have changed really.
NEUT17|I think more of the green climate change deal is more of like a social pressure so I don't know if you'd be more socially aware not to litter and just things like that, especially if you did something that's against the environment on the Internet.
NEUT18|You'll be flamed.
NEUT19|You might already see beyond meat in some major chain restaurants like Taco Bell, one of the main things you might have noticed was it's more expensive than me.
NEUT20|That doesn't really make any sense for you, right?
BULL21|You know 'cause you think that regular meat taste better than plant based meat, so not a lot of people take that leap of faith, but I think with the trend in 2019 with proper funding, they'll be able to make more cost efficient way.
NEUT22|And just fit it in everyone's lives and everyone's diet but hundred and some research, it is found that beyond meat is actually overvalued right now.
NEUT23|I believe it's stock is at $76.
NEUT24|Unless it ain't already.
NEUT25|But I think the correct value is around 40 to $42.
NEUT26|But I guess that would be the price target.
NEUT27|I don't know.
NEUT28|I think I might invest into myself forward the year of 2020 and this is just surface level thinking.
NEUT29|Not much research done into it.
NEUT30|So don't take initiative to quickly.
NEUT31|I would suggest doing some more research anyways if you're watching this in 2021 and just being like, oh oh is correct.
NEUT32|Well, what can I say?
NEUT33|Just hit the subscribe button.
NEUT34|And if you're watching this in 2021, knowing that beyond meat fell.
NEUT35|Wasn't for me.
BULL36|Alright, I hope you guys enjoyed that video.
NEUT37|I understand it was a little short, I just wanted to give my thoughts on the 2020 and how it'll go.
NEUT38|I do have another video coming up and it'll be reselling sneakers.
NEUT39|I think it'll be really interesting.
BULL40|"Hope you guys enjoy and have a good day."""
