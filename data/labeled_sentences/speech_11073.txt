NEUT1|January 30th.
NEUT2|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions benefits of holding onto NIO.
NEUT3|Alright, let's get started the truth about the stock market is that market dips are when fortunes can be made.
NEUT4|In the case of an IO, this is absolutely true.
BEAR5|Although NIO shares are currently down 2.35% due to Gamestop's buying frenzy, shares of NIO are rated as a strong buy because of their latest breakout Anio stocked up to $66.99 Cup shaped by point in solid volume January 8th.
NEUT6|According to market analysis.
NEUT7|The second stage pattern goes back to late November and formed above the 50 day line, which is a positive.
NEUT8|The 5% chase zone extends to $60.17 the way that NIO is currently trading in its chase zone shows that the stock has a very long term potential and over time, the more you add to your portfolio, the more games you will receive in the long run.
BULL9|NIO reported strong December sales in 2021, which sent shares soaring.
BULL10|NIO stock surged again on January 11th after it unveiled its first electric sedan with a longer range battery in self-driving features on NIO Day.
NEUT11|It's a waiting game.
NEUT12|The trick about getting the most about your portfolio is to be ready for any dip and to be willing to commit some cash to buy up stocks whose prices are dropping whenever you buy into a stock, you probably won't catch the stock at its lowest, but that's fine as long as you are adding some stock to your portfolio, little by little.
NEUT13|The point is to be opportunistic on investments you think have good long term potential like NIO.
BEAR14|Every time a long term stock dips you should look at it as a flash sale and if you miss buying up a stock at this point then you will miss your moment of opportunity.
NEUT15|One strategy to overcome the fear of bad timing is to dollar cost.
NEUT16|Average your way into the investment dollar.
NEUT17|Cost averaging smooths out your purchase price overtime and put your money to work when other investors are huddled on the sidelines or headed for the exits.
