NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol JMI A we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|For not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|So if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT4|Very nice movement today on this one and not only from the price action point of view, but you look down there at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one going forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and resistance as we head into the weekend.
NEUT7|First level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim.
BULL8|Would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be if the price could say appear above $5.75.
NEUT9|I don't get me wrong.
NEUT10|If the price falls below 575.
BULL11|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a massive sign of power going forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT17|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT18|That right there is how I'm defining the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT21|Every must visualize that.
NEUT22|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT23|Yeah, staying above 575 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of assistance are concerned, very straightforward.
NEUT24|It's all about that pink line there, which on my chart represents the 200.
NEUT25|Moving average and that is currently valued right there at $6.
NEUT26|So Public Enemy number one $6 going into next week, but on all.
BULL27|Anyway, look at it, fantastic volume today, great price movement.
NEUT28|I'm sure this one set off a whole bunch of scanners, so there's going to be plenty of people discovering it over the weekend.
BULL29|So let's see if the price can indeed continue to build up on this momentum next week.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird.
NEUT35|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT36|But in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
