NEUT0|"""Yeah, I mean if you look right now in this TV craze that we're seeing for really a Golden age for the vehicles, really what Quantum focuses on is what I call solid state with him."
NEUT1|And with this really could do in terms of what they've demo'd.
BULL2|This can increase the charge by 80%.
BULL3|You know from what you see today so it really could potentially revolutionize the EV industry relative to the constraints that we've seen on lithium ion.
NEUT4|But it's always been the Holy Grail to get here.
NEUT5|An EV battery site.
BEAR6|It appears they have cracked some of the code now just like you talked about.
NEUT7|Can they ultimately scale this to a factory and ultimately widespread that's going to be the focus, but right now investors you're continuing to view this as potentially the Holy Grail VV batteries.
NEUT8|Or what do people that actually know something in this in this area say I'm talking bout physicists and an I guess maybe it's even quantum physics.
NEUT9|At this point it.
NEUT10|Is it possible to have a Moore's law progression in EV?
NEUT11|Or are there physical constraints that don't make that possible, just based on the nature of things?
NEUT12|Well, I've always been issued 40 years trying to crack this code.
BULL13|If you could, how they've demo'd it in terms of what they figured out on solid state battery technology, it appears at least that they have started to have massive success here and I think that's really what's been the eye opener for investors here.
NEUT14|You know in terms of and of course they they are backed by Bill Gates, VW, so strong backers if they could scale this, it's a game changer, but that's going to be the question is that can this be scaled in a massive level?
NEUT15|That could really be deployed if it can, it changes the whole paradigm.
NEUT16|I mean they can't be alone in trying to work on this.
NEUT17|What what?
NEUT18|What is their proprietary approach?
NEUT19|To doing this.
NEUT20|Yeah, it's really been I mean, but I'll call the Golden goose is on the metallic with the inside.
NEUT21|They've figured out from a solid state perspective how to.
NEUT22|Ultimately, you know, deploy this without using well called Wet Electric Light.
NEUT23|And if you use dry ones, that could be something that doesn't have issues in cold, which continues to be something on the EV and ultimately could.
BULL24|Per charge, get it up upwards 50 to 80% more new in terms of per charge, and I think that's where the key here.
NEUT25|If you start to look at 506 hundred miles per charge, changes the whole economics of TV and it's everything that Tesla as well as all the other EV players in China are going after.
NEUT26|I think it speaks to what you're seeing it really, not just the gold needs.
NEUT27|For parabolic, you know, sort of appetite for these stocks, not just Tesla, but tho EV food chain.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
