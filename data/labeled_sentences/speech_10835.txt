NEUT0|"""What does 2021 holds for you strategically big year."
NEUT1|Overall, you announced this in five deal for about $10 billion, which is which is huge.
NEUT2|How is 2021 different than 2020 from a strategic standpoint?
BULL3|Sure, thanks John and happy Holidays to you and the whole team over at CNBC.
BULL4|We were very excited about 2021.
BULL5|As you noted, we ended the year with a lot of strong momentum.
BULL6|Including being added to the NASDAQ 100, which was a huge honor for our company.
BEAR7|When we look up to 2021, I think there is just a tremendous tailwind overall for the semiconductor industry and for Marvel specifically, you can see the activity on 5G spectrum and licenses.
NEUT8|That's going on right now.
NEUT9|These numbers are astronomical in terms of what the spectrum is going for in the United States.
BULL10|You've got cloud computing, which I think is set to very strong.
NEUT11|First half of the year.
BULL12|And then finally the automotive sector has rebounded very strongly.
BULL13|Those are marvels 3 focus areas, and I think we're extremely well positioned for 2021.
NEUT14|Obviously within five layering and later in the year.
NEUT15|Once we can close that transaction.
NEUT16|Matt, one potential big sea change in semiconductors is this move by many powerful companies to double down on ARM technology and build their own solutions that they used to go outside to names like Intel.
NEUT17|For now.
NEUT18|I know you're not in that exact corner of semiconductors, but does that trend affect Marvel at all, and if so, how?
NEUT19|Yeah, no John.
NEUT20|Actually it's a huge opportunity for us and I was watching earlier when Joanna was speaking and so on.
NEUT21|The consumer side, you know, clearly armed is had a very strong position traditionally in mobile phones and now some of these laptop applications.
NEUT22|But what you may not know is that Marvel is is probably the most important partner of ARM in the data infrastructure market.
NEUT23|So applications like 5G chipsets for the for the base stations, enterprise networking, cloud computing.
NEUT24|Marvel is a designer and a leading supplier of high end microprocessor technology based on arm for the infrastructure and as it relates to the large system OEM's.
NEUT25|Designing their own chips.
NEUT26|This is a huge opportunity for us because absent only a few companies, Apple being one when you hear a system OEM talk about doing their own custom chips, almost every one of those needs a Silicon partner with the process technology platform, the packaging capability and the advanced IP to go actually put the chips together, manufacture them and ship them in high volume.
BEAR27|So we're seeing a huge uptrend in our business in that area which we refer to as our ASIC business.
BULL28|Or custom chip business and we did some very important announcements in the last few months around our five nanometer platform, which as you can imagine is being very well received by 5G companies, cloud OEM's enterprise customers as well as in automotive.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
