NEUT0|"""Alright, it's Monday, June 10th."
NEUT1|And I'm looking at AMD stock and this has all the characteristics of a stock.
NEUT2|That you can short.
BEAR3|Even though it's clearly bullish, but now I'm thinking it's bearish this is going to pull back more than likely tomorrow.
NEUT4|Up the weekly saying that as well, even though we just had a very bearish week last week, you can see that weekly chart.
NEUT5|Clearly the month, the monthly month of June is still early in looking really bullish, but.
NEUT6|Just when you see this candle.
BEAR7|Very overextended, it's due to pull back.
NEUT8|So let's see if I can get in short.
NEUT9|Take a look at that in a couple days.
NEUT10|OK, several days later I'm looking at AMD.
NEUT11|So I was picking this to drop.
NEUT12|On the 10th, after the 10th.
BEAR13|As you can see, it definitely did that and it was just really obvious because this is extremely bearish candle on the 10th.
BEAR14|We got this major gap from the moving averages, overextended really needed to pull back.
NEUT15|So this wasn't.
NEUT16|It wasn't that hard and I really like looking for these overextended.
NEUT17|Type stocks.
NEUT18|And Luckily the scanner will search for these overextended type traits.
NEUT19|So if you want to learn how to use the scanner and find these overextended super reliable traits.
