NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this technical analysis video here at exam.com is Tuesday, February 4th and today will be looking at the British pound versus the Australian dollar in the four hour chart."
BULL1|So zooming into the chart we can see that the pair came under strong selling pressure after reaching overbought levels near a 3 1/2 year high of one point.
BEAR2|9750 last week I given the weakness in the area Sinamak D and the fact that the price is currently trying to close below the 50.
BEAR3|Moving average after breaching the 20.
NEUT4|S MA.
NEUT5|The self is expected to continue and therefore we could look next for support near 1.92 where the 50% bonus of the applet from one point 8650 to one point 9750 is placed below that, we have several obstacles to keep in mind.
NEUT6|First is the former resistance area around one point 9150 and then a more important restrictive region between one point 91 N one point 9037 which includes the 61.8%.
NEUT7|One change that 200.
BEAR8|Moving average falling lower all attention will turn to the ascending trendline that holds from July 30th as any significant decline below it would eliminate confidence on the market's six month old uptrend.
NEUT9|I look into the upside now.
NEUT10|If the price rebounds above the 50.
BULL11|Moving average and the 38.2% Fibonacci of one point, 9330 buying orders could increase towards one point.
NEUT12|9440 at break of which could probably bring additional games.
NEUT13|Until the one point 9521 high on December 16th.
BULL14|If this proves easy to get through then we would like to see a rally above one point 9626 to see if to shift focus towards the three and a half year high of one point, 9750.
NEUT15|So that's all from me.
NEUT16|Thank you for watching.
BULL17|"Have a great day."""
