NEUT0|"""Everybody's heard from springtraining.com want to hit you guys with another trade review today and in this video I want to talk about some of the low floats have been trading."
NEUT1|Basically one long that I did today and then one short that I did actually I'm currently still in it.
NEUT2|Maybe we can complete the trade on this video will see.
NEUT3|But anyways today is March 24th 2021 if you want to go back and look at the date and what I was looking at in trading so HP.
NEUT4|Our first one I want to talk about.
NEUT5|So this was one small cap name that started to break out off the lows.
NEUT6|Basically I started to pay attention to it around 584.
BULL7|Once it started to push into the 13 Ma, which is 1.
NEUT8|I started to look to get into the position.
BULL9|I saw that it was breaking through that level with some resistance headroom basically into the top 854 than the 891 area on the upside, which made sense from a risk war perspective.
NEUT10|We've had these low float stocks kind of running lately, so decided to go after this name.
BULL11|Basically, like I said, broke that level of resistance.
NEUT12|Rescored makes sense to.
NEUT13|The upside is risking about, I think $0.60 to make $2.00 at the time so you can see that obviously I entered.
NEUT14|At the let's just see here 689 spot you know so little bit in 704-720-3791 added it a little bit at 8:15, which I believe was after the first one halt.
NEUT15|And then it pushed into the nine 60s, nine fifties 90s, sold some more there.
NEUT16|And then I believe it halted again and then after the next aanholt I grabbed a whole whole bunch of it about 1064, ten thirty seven 1046.
NEUT17|And then it halted again and then open up at 1160, which I ended up dumping 3/4 of it and then it was going to halt at 1083, which is actually where it's currently halted right now.
NEUT18|And typically what we see is when something is going to halt the Lt we pinned on the bid and the ASK side we will stay there at the same level for maybe 345 seconds and then it will halt.
BEAR19|I was noticing that price action the way down I ended up cutting out the entire position.
NEUT20|So All in all I don't know what that trade was.
NEUT21|689 -- 1162.
NEUT22|4-5 point something like that.
NEUT23|Just do the math here.
NEUT24|Full day trading.
NEUT25|Can't think of it off the top of my head 470-1470.
NEUT26|Well, you know decent trade for $4.70 to the upside.
NEUT27|Basically just playing the momentum and playing the volume, adding into it.
NEUT28|When I thought was the right time.
NEUT29|Now another short that I want to talk about.
NEUT30|Just real quick after hours.
NEUT31|Might as well talk about it.
NEUT32|Basically this GM.
BULL33|I saw some topping on it after hours.
NEUT34|Took it short right here.
BULL35|I'm still in it covered some right here an if basically gets back above the 760 level.
BEAR36|On the upside I'm going to end up exiting the rest of the position so.
NEUT37|You know, whenever you see topping on a name, if you are a short seller, obviously make sure the risk word makes sense to take it.
NEUT38|In this case it did.
NEUT39|And what I've been noticing too is a lot of these.
NEUT40|These names that have been running these smaller stocks, especially in the after hours have been giving it back after they get that first initial run, so that's kind of the price action I was looking for.
NEUT41|But anyways, let's.
NEUT42|We'll see what happens with it again, just want to show you maybe I can complete the trade, you know, during the little video here, but obviously.
NEUT43|Not enough time and who that's it guys?
NEUT44|And my target on this right now is going to be around the six 2630 level so I can get there.
NEUT45|I'll cover the rest of it most likely, or cover 3/4 of it breaks that level of support.
NEUT46|I'll be looking for the next leg down towards the law.
NEUT47|Pretty much the close price 495 block area, but anyways that's it guys.
BULL48|Thanks for watching.
NEUT49|"If you have any questions you can go to spartantraining.com, otherwise will see you guys next week."""
