NEUT0|"""Jim, you mentioned herd immunity."
NEUT1|Barclays has a note out today where they say if you think of immunity as a combination of those who've had it and recovered and those who've gotten the vaccine, they think 23 states have achieved 10% immunity and that very dynamic huge implications for the economy is what Larry Fink talked to the gang on squawk this morning about take a listen.
NEUT2|When we have herd immunity.
NEUT3|Through vaccinations we're going to see the industries that are that are still struggling.
NEUT4|The industries around the aggregation.
NEUT5|An congregation of human beings such as culture such as business conferences, sporting events, and importantly restaurant San.
NEUT6|Importantly travel.
NEUT7|That's when you're going to start seeing in the most, certainly by the fourth quarter.
NEUT8|But maybe in the third quarter real extended.
NEUT9|Economic.
BULL10|Rally in terms of the overall economy.
NEUT11|Alright Jim, so if the if that light at the end of the tunnel starts to really get bright as the market price it in or is there more to go?
NEUT12|No, the market is not priced.
NEUT13|It not at all.
NEUT14|I had Larry totally right.
NEUT15|I think that they'll be animal spirits of people that will override even what we've seen in the stock market.
NEUT16|Obviously it'll be sectors that you want to buy Coca Cola in that.
NEUT17|Well, I don't know.
NEUT18|I mean, maybe some of the companies that use their service use the so called soda jerk job right where you're someone's **** it at a restaurant.
NEUT19|But you know what Carl?
NEUT20|I've got to tell you, and I've done that job.
NEUT21|So don't mean being a jerk.
NEUT22|OK, I've got to tell you that Larry is precise in as we get more herd immunity, we will feel like we should do something with the money that we've been saving that may actually cause some some selling of the stock market, but not if we get another big stimulus check.
NEUT23|I mean, this is the Murray men are going to David, that stimulus check comes to the merry Men of jobs.
NEUT24|Then look out.
NEUT25|It's going to be Virgin Galactic.
NEUT26|Take out the 50 and or and or any other SPAC came stock price or when they announced their deal to your point, President elect Biden going to speak.
NEUT27|I think tonight on the plans for potentially as you're saying that new relief package that could include as much as $2000.
NEUT28|Do you think David should go to people who are out of work in need or you think it's just you go to everybody?
NEUT29|I think it should go to people who are out of work in need.
NEUT30|Was that a trick question?
NEUT31|Well, in Washington you know and then you've got the prospect Jim and Carl as well.
NEUT32|Of course for infrastructure spending again in the Biden ministration.
NEUT33|If they can get things through now weather.
NEUT34|But you can actually get through this Congress this divided Congress.
NEUT35|This Congress that's dealing with the with the impact, of course, of the invasion of where it works and and who, if anybody may have actually helped in some way from the inside.
NEUT36|I mean, it's just hard to imagine they're going to get much of anything done, but perhaps they will.
NEUT37|One can only hope that will be the case.
NEUT38|Well Quora, what I think we're all looking for is something that unites us.
NEUT39|I don't know how you do that, but I think that if you get any sort of feeling which says that Washington is not going to implode and you get herd immunity, then I'm not saying happy days are here again.
NEUT40|But maybe it could be a little like 2018.
NEUT41|I think you still wear a mask at a lot of places except for these states that don't seem to like Oklahoma.
BULL42|I don't think it's a mandate, but things will get somewhat back to normal.
NEUT43|But most importantly, people will absolutely do something.
NEUT44|As opposed to feeling to do nothing and will be the spring, I think it'll be like our life is going to be a time of.
NEUT45|Happiness.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
