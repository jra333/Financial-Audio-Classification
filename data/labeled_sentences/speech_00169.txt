NEUT0|"""Palantir stock analysis and price prediction, December 15th in today's Palantir stock analysis and price prediction."
BULL1|Palantir's savvy strategy alright.
NEUT2|Let's get started to me.
NEUT3|It seems the company is pivoting toward government work, which is much less controversial.
NEUT4|A glance at the company's most recent press releases indicates this may be the case.
BULL5|The company is working to strengthen a partnership with the Greek government to fight the novel coronavirus and then on December 8th the company announced it heading to $44.4 million deal to provide data analytics for the Food and Drug Administration.
BULL6|Palantir is much more likely to seek & more of these non controversial contracts in light of the incoming Biden administration.
NEUT7|Further, Palantir's operations and contracts speak to accompany decidedly on the right of the political spectrum.
BEAR8|Trump is leaving office and conservative politics will have a diminished voice.
NEUT9|Soon.
NEUT10|Palantir management knows this.
NEUT11|Palantir also knows it must play the game of politics to pump up profits.
BULL12|Biden's team is will likely to view Palantir as favorably as Trump's government did.
NEUT13|Palantir can provide software and analytics solutions across a broad spectrum of industry.
NEUT14|It has clearly done so already and has a deep government network into which it can contracted services.
BULL15|Rising revenue.
BULL16|Palantir recorded a strong Q3 revenue rose 52% in Q3 2020 compared to those in Q3 2019.
BULL17|Further, the company raised full year revenue guidance to project an increase in revenue of 44% year over year.
BULL18|In 2020, the company also recorded an EPS beat of $0.05 on an anticipated 2 cent EPS projection.
BULL19|This speaks to a strong company and not one in trouble, despite Wall Street's indecisive consensus.
BULL20|The company is pivoting and based on recent news, the markets will reward that pivot.
BULL21|Palantir stock jumped more than 20% on the news of its $44.4 million three year contract.
BULL22|With the FDA, Palantir is projecting more than $1 billion in 2020 revenue.
BULL23|So why should a relatively measly $44.4 million of a billion move market capitalization up by 20%?
NEUT24|The answer is simple.
BULL25|Palantir is playing the game and winning contracts that are Congress with the political atmosphere.
NEUT26|Palantir's strategy remains the same.
NEUT27|Play the political winds to its favor and leverage its network.
BULL28|It should continue to rise as a consequence.
