NEUT3|If you play all exploration oil and gas exploration company with operations in New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma, the company was founded in 2002 after spinoff from Helmrich and Payne and right now 30% of their oil production, oil and gas production is Mid Continental Mid Continental.
NEUT4|It means.
NEUT5|Oklahoma and 70% is in the Permian Basin.
NEUT6|What I'm really interested in all companies right now is the Permian Basin because this is the place to make money.
NEUT7|And what about this company, how much money they can make?
NEUT8|Actually there is something interesting to note with this company not only with the Permian Basin but also in Oklahoma and other places.
NEUT9|But I will just tell you about the Permian Basin look at how much all the produce last year in the Permian Basin alone they produce.
NEUT10|46 million barrels of oil.
NEUT11|OK, therefore, at this number.
NEUT12|Now let's see how much all they have in reserve.
NEUT13|There proved reserves in the Permian Basin and it's 334 billion barrels of oil.
NEUT14|Do you see the problem here?
NEUT15|If they keep production other connect rate, they will run out of oil in seven years and it's the same thing.
NEUT16|If you look at the Oklahoma Reserve that they have, it's the same thing.
BEAR17|They will run out of oil in the coming year.
NEUT18|In all the companies that.
NEUT19|Avenal eyes I expect them to at least have reserved for the next five years, and there is.
NEUT20|There are things that these companies can do.
NEUT21|They can acquire other companies to grow their reserves.
NEUT22|They can find new meta to have more proof, resort to grow the proof result.
NEUT23|Yes, it's possible, but if you look at this company they have not been doing this.
NEUT24|The proof reserved amount of all that they have not been growing in many years.
NEUT25|It doesn't stagnate.
NEUT26|Now let's have a look at the fundamentals of the company.
NEUT27|the PE ratio is 9.39.
NEUT28|Roscoe Book is 1.64.
NEUT29|The profit margin is 26.90%.
NEUT30|Their returns on assets is 8.35%.
NEUT31|Their returns on equity is 19.16%.
NEUT32|That that vacancy ratio is 0.58.
NEUT33|The current ratio is 0.65 and the dividend is 1.14%.
BULL34|This this company has really good fundamentals.
NEUT35|I don't have anything to complain about the fundamentals about the business, about their profit margins.
BULL36|They have good margin.
NEUT37|This is a wonderful piece that the only thing I don't like with this business is that it will stop growing in less than seven years.
BEAR38|And this is bad.
NEUT39|I don't want to invest in the company and they run out of oil in seven years because one thing you should understand this is the problem with all that.
NEUT40|It's limited.
NEUT41|But there are ways to get more oil there always.
NEUT42|But this company I don't see them going in this direction.
NEUT43|So because of this.
NEUT44|I would invest in this company even though they have a period of nine compared to control resources, I'm investing.
NEUT45|Controversial says they have a period of around 25.
NEUT46|One thing they could do is cut productions produce less oil because oil.
NEUT47|So at this current possible so expensive they use that money to acquire new assets.
NEUT48|And when all processes get more expensive that they produce more oil but they want to produce everything right now.
NEUT49|So let me know in the comments what do you think about this company.
