NEUT0|"""It's interesting every day we're going to be sitting here a year from now, talking about ever increasing numbers, and the reality is what Amazon is doing is they're changing that landscape."
NEUT1|I don't know what Black Friday looked like the first time.
NEUT2|Whatever company instituted it?
NEUT3|Maybe that's worth taking a look, but it grows and it becomes something into your point about Black Friday and a half or prime day and a half.
NEUT4|We don't call Black Friday and half becomes a November event, so this will continue going.
NEUT5|And at this point what's interesting about Amazon is they've been digging a Moat, and they've been digging a Moat around retail and it gets deeper and deeper.
NEUT6|Now it's getting broader and broader at the same time.
NEUT7|So in terms of where it's going to go, it just depends on what year you're willing to pay for, and at this point right now it creeps higher.
NEUT8|Could they make some real headwind when it comes to incorporating Whole Foods into Prime day this time around?
NEUT9|So what's interesting is on the one hand, they're growing third party and it's all about the marketplace.
NEUT10|On the other hand, if you look at what's happening today, Prime Day doesn't start until the countdown says it does, and yet there's a lot of Amazon related deals that are going on right now with their own products, and Whole Foods has been issuing deals for some time now, so at the same time that they're growing this marketplace, Amazon is making us further and further dependent on their own ecosystem.
NEUT11|And that gets you into Whole Foods, because then you get the $10 credit back.
NEUT12|At Amazon, at the same time, you're seeing 10% off if you use their credit card, so this whole ecosystem is really interesting and growing, and there's really no sign that that's going to stop.
NEUT13|How important is our private label?
NEUT14|Amazon Brand's going to be in that company's future?
NEUT15|Increasingly so, and what that does is it gives you sales, but it also gives you margin, right?
BULL16|We need that margin to be able to reinvest for SG and A to be able to continue digging that mode.
NEUT17|But in addition to the actual product and the sale itself, the importance and the dependence that we have is the key.
NEUT18|Because Amazon's all about in Tekken Sass and everything is all about recurring revenue, locking us into that.
NEUT19|We need them later at the end of the day you give away an echo device.
NEUT20|If that then inspires for future purchases that works like razor and razor blades.
BULL21|It's up 83% in a year.
NEUT22|I buy it here by here.
NEUT23|We like it.
NEUT24|It's going to keep going in.
BEAR25|The reality is it will creep.
NEUT26|So we've talked about this with a lot of my other retail names that we talk, but in undercoverage that are trading at multiples that seem astronomical relative to what they've done in the past.
NEUT27|But you think about it, we've like and Nike to Amazon in that if you are the largest player and you can spend the most, then the reality is people are willing to spend the most on you and on your shares.
NEUT28|Amazon is the ultimate version of that.
