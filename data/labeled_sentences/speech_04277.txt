NEUT8|The strategies that I use.
NEUT9|Just whatever you want speak about and we can bring it there and leave the spam out because I'm controlling it spans not getting then, so it's actually going to be a good group of guys just kind of coming together, learning together and following along and see what the markets got you know about.
NEUT10|So alright enough of that, let's jump into Amazon AMZN and this is your daily and I'm not liking it guys.
NEUT11|I'll be quite honest with you.
NEUT12|It is have a.
BEAR13|A flag potential here where it's kind of building, but the fact that the entire market would green today and this was read, it's just not a good look.
NEUT14|Anytime you have a Green Day, you want your big stock to follow along with the market.
NEUT15|If it's red and it's red as expected, the fact that today was green across the board that I've seen and Amazon is red.
NEUT16|Maybe you know science to come.
NEUT17|I've really think buyers start to see this $2000 per stock.
NEUT18|In their rear window windshield and starting to say you know what I'm gonna hold off, there's gotta be a better time to buy and you know, is sitting right here at an all time high.
BULL19|However, is sitting all over as resistance a good level of support.
NEUT20|Back here 1875.
NEUT21|As you see it here, which is the top of here in the bottom of here.
NEUT22|And I've got a channel inside of a channel.
NEUT23|And I've been watching to see if he could possibly go back up and touch the top of this one or come back down to this area touch this channel.
NEUT24|And let's look at the hour.
NEUT25|Let's see what it says.
BEAR26|So it's been kind of popping along here the last couple days and then the last two days.
NEUT27|It's been basically sideways and actually in the below this channel, which is still way too early to tell.
BEAR28|As you see, there is outliers occasionally.
NEUT29|This could be one of those occasions towards an outlier and comes back in.
NEUT30|Oh, and but the volume did come in here at the end of the day at the bottom, so that's actually a good thing, because that means people came in and it didn't follow any further, but didn't go up.
NEUT31|It means there is some buyers coming in so way too early to tell, but would have to come back Monday to see if we get back in this channel or if it continues down.
NEUT32|Let's look at the weekly total weekly is just.
BEAR33|The weekly still looks OK. Next week could be red.
BULL34|Like I say, it looks like it may be going to ride along this area here in touch.
NEUT35|This channel again before it runs back up, but.
NEUT36|Not a whole lot being said there, except in between this line of resistance and this line of support.
NEUT37|So guys I see it on Amazon.
