NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, I'll be doing a short video on Facebook giving our take."
BULL1|The stock's been in the news a lot lately, and hopefully this video will help clarify our position on Facebook.
NEUT2|So first of all, look at where Facebook pivoted right at the 148 level.
BULL3|And this is the level we drew in his strong support.
NEUT4|It's also the level where the stock previously broke out of earlier in July.
NEUT5|This is where the buyers came back in and the shorts began to cover.
NEUT6|Understanding how to read a chart is important.
NEUT7|We're not diehard chart enthusia STS, but we believe that utilizing a chart is important, and if you look back.
NEUT8|You know two years.
NEUT9|You'd be able to draw this support line here, and maybe you wouldn't have panicked and sold, and on this recent decline, because if you sold in the one 50s and now Facebook is in the one 60s.
NEUT10|You might be feeling pretty stupid right now, but that's OK. That's that's what learning is for.
NEUT11|So we like to utilize the technical analysis to supplement our fundamental analysis.
NEUT12|And then of course looking at the valuation.
NEUT13|So we go to morningstar.com for a fundamental analysis.
NEUT14|Facebook is trading at a PE ratio of 29 based on 2017 earnings and also at 22 times next year's earnings.
BULL15|Facebook is forecasted to grow at 23% over the next five years.
NEUT16|Given its stock, a PEG ratio of .96.
NEUT17|Very cheap, remember anything below.
NEUT18|One is cheap.
BEAR19|Now we're not 100% certain that Facebook's growth won't be impacted by this Cambridge analytical data breach.
BULL20|However, we feel pretty comfortable investing in Facebook at this level because of its cheap valuation.
NEUT21|We feel a lot of risk is off.
NEUT22|There's really zero competitive threats out there to steal market cap at this time.
BULL23|Adult Snapchat's gonna jump in and still market cap.
NEUT24|That management team has been kind of a joke and Google kind of operates in a different different market still.
BULL25|Furthermore, if we analyze Facebook's fundamentals, we see that its operating margins have been increasing annually.
NEUT26|Return on invested capital is 23%.
BULL27|And free cash flow from revenue is 43%, which is incredible.
BULL28|So all is good in that Department.
NEUT29|We see Facebook as a buy here and have a lofty five year price target on the stock.

NEUT37|We're not.
BULL38|We're not completely out of the waters here with with Facebook, but with earnings coming up, hopefully this calms people down a little bit and Zuckerberg.
NEUT39|One and testified before Congress, so hopefully a lot of the risk is off in this situation, and we'll see.
BULL40|"Hi guys, take care."""
