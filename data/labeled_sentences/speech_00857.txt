BULL0|"""Hello Friends, welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video."
NEUT1|France.
NEUT2|In this video we're going to discuss about Tonix Pharmaceuticals Holding Corp and this is the weekly chart.
NEUT3|So if you're looking at this particular chart, there are some trends which are evolving and it is giving us an indication about the formation of support.
NEUT4|So let's see how this is.
NEUT5|And how we should approach?
NEUT6|You know, in terms of trend and trade as well, so I think this will be it.
NEUT7|For this particular stock, and.
NEUT8|Because one thing is there that if you observe this entire highlighted area, this itself looks like a trading range.
NEUT9|So we're not going to go beyond this range, so this range consists of two points.
NEUT10|On the down side you have $0.37 an.
NEUT11|On the upside you have $4 Azure big Target, and that's what we are looking at so.
NEUT12|What you need to do, there are two specific points.
NEUT13|.5 two will be your first line of support and .37 will be your last support, so one should not or one must not carry any further positions below .37.
NEUT14|And if the stock holds above .5 two $0.52 or $0.53, then we're looking at our first target at one point, $8.00 an if it sustained above, let's say in between 1.8 it is 1.86.
NEUT15|So you can consider it as 1.9 or $2.00.
NEUT16|So if the stock sustain above $2.00, then we're talking about a target which is as high as $4.
NEUT17|So I'm not saying that $4 will be the last target, but if you're looking at the overall trend, as you can see.
NEUT18|The trend has been falling down since 2014 or 2015, so we will go one step after another and as I told you an as shown in the highlighted section that this itself looks like a trading range once it surpasses over $4 then we will count on the upcoming trend and we will re analyze the next you know, probable or forecasting trend which will give us an idea about.
NEUT19|Or above.
NEUT20|$4 or so, so that is not in the picture right now.
NEUT21|Otherwise you can consider here next target in between 27 and $50.00, But this is not the way to look at any trend.
NEUT22|What we're going to do, we're looking at $4 as our big target for the time being, so this is the end of the video.
