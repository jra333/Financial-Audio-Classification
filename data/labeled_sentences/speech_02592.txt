NEUT0|"""I wanted to give a very typical example of a trade that we do at messages trading and this example of Disney very common stock commonly traded stock."
NEUT1|So first of all, in order for you to be able to trade the way I'm trading, you need to have a reference point and the way I do this is to have my own indicators here.
NEUT2|You can see the four lines and then share it.
NEUT3|You can find out more about them by going to tradingview.com and looking for me master shirts.
NEUT4|So the latest example actually was sent on 1st of April, not a April Fools joke.
NEUT5|Obviously alert was sent here to my subscribers and notice that I obviously didn't know what was going to happen so.
NEUT6|The charts at the time kind of looks like that.
NEUT7|I just saw basically all I saw was a close above the blue line.
NEUT8|You can see it right there where I'm hovering.
NEUT9|The same goes for this previous alerts as well.
NEUT10|You know you can just be.
NEUT11|Doing absolutely nothing and then, Oh well, we saw a close above the blue.
NEUT12|That's all we need.
NEUT13|So I sent an alert and notice that.
BULL14|Several days later, actually, today with a huge move in our favor for Disney over 15 or 16% actually.
NEUT15|And this is the type of trades that occurs occasionally.
NEUT16|Sometimes the advance is slow and steady, sometimes just explosive like this.
NEUT17|The point I'm trying to make here is that we try to simplify trading.
NEUT18|We tried to make it very easy and obvious and if you look on this charity, is this obvious?
NEUT19|All we have to do is just look at the chart she wear.
NEUT20|The blue line is and just buy above unclosable and so this is basically what they do and this is how we trade at mastercheftrading.com.
NEUT21|"Again, you can find out more about it by going to trainyou.com an looking for me at master charts."""
