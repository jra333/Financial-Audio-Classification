BEAR0|"""Yo what's going on?"
BEAR1|Guys gonna breakdown Facebook stock for you right now it's getting a lot of attention 'cause look at this run off the lows.
NEUT2|I mean, look at this look at I mean 140.
NEUT3|The 2:10, like almost with no pullbacks, this thing is moving guys.
NEUT4|Lot of tech stocks are moving right now.
NEUT5|Would I buy this right now?
NEUT6|Probably not tell you why.
BULL7|I mean we broke right through the 200 day moving average and pretty much been straight up earnings.
BEAR8|Obviously the stock market like the earnings big gap up.
NEUT9|I would personally wait to buy this on a pullback of 200 to 190.
NEUT10|See if we hold the 200 level or to 190 level which is right around the 200 day moving average.
NEUT11|If I buy back this out, I mean look how volatile the stocks been guys, I would seriously wait for a pullback to get into this and see if it holds up.
BULL12|There's a good chance it's going to go higher as long as it holds 200 and 190 and puts in at higher low to push the higher highs.
NEUT13|Probably go test 225.
NEUT14|Stop listening to these guys that are breaking down earnings reports.
BULL15|Obviously the market like the earnings it gapped up.
NEUT16|You don't need to know anything else.
NEUT17|Stop listening to these guys that want to break down every little file.
NEUT18|In their in their company sheet and breakdown, every little bit of data guys, it doesn't matter.
NEUT19|The only thing that matters is those stock going up is a stock going down.
NEUT20|That's the only thing that matters is price.
NEUT21|You know, that's it.
NEUT22|You want to make money.
NEUT23|Then you need to just follow price.
NEUT24|That's how you make money in the stock market.
NEUT25|For Facebook, I think it's eventually a by.
BULL26|I think we're going to go higher.
NEUT27|Just just look at this.
NEUT28|How volatile is so?
NEUT29|I personally would wait for a pullback.
NEUT30|I probably will be getting in this stock at some point, which is why I'm doing it.
NEUT31|Video on it and when I do get in I will put a video out.
NEUT32|But guys, if you don't know any technical analysis, you should learn some.
NEUT33|I have a video on my channel that explains it pretty simply and then also I'm going to do a weekly stock watchlist.
NEUT34|Check that out, just subscribe to the channel.
NEUT35|Careful with Facebook, very valuable.
NEUT36|Volatile, sorry about that and I would wait for a pullback.
BULL37|Overall, it's a great company, lot of growth.
NEUT38|It's not going anywhere.
BULL39|It's going to be around even after all this.
NEUT40|They have so much in cash like no debt.
BULL41|It's a great company guys, which is why we should get in.
NEUT42|But get in at the right time.
NEUT43|"Alright guys later."""
