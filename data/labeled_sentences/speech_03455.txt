BEAR0|"""Joining of watching this week video an update on General Electric generating stock has been bearish for awhile since the virus came in and then now is moving sideways."
NEUT1|Sideways trained so trendless this is Global view.
NEUT2|If you're gonna go more in detail in one hour chart we can see that the market again it's been moving sideways moving between channel top line and bottom line.
NEUT3|If they form a channel where the prices move inside it.
BEAR4|The bottom line is dotted line is been broken where the price went down up to one more $6.
NEUT5|Remember round round numbers are very important in technical analysis, but just have a look to my lessons regarding right numbers, but they have very important meaning in tech in in for technical analysis, so this let's say #6 worked as suas support.
NEUT6|Sorry SS as as a SAS working as support for this new really.
NEUT7|So there really is just started the idea based on taking analysis this this this price can go up up to potentially up to $7.00.
NEUT8|Is our target price, but this total line convoking workers resistance, so perhaps we can wait this datalounge cannot be broken and there's this other lender can work as resistance so.
NEUT9|But anyway, the idea is that the market seems that he jumped up and he started going up even if Bolin myself going down volume are going down and there is no even.
NEUT10|You know the voice expecting.
NEUT11|Major volumes there.
NEUT12|There is not a lot of look at.
NEUT13|Look at this one.
NEUT14|Look at this one this massive volume there so that the price went up again.
NEUT15|There's the price.
NEUT16|Went up the volume there.
NEUT17|It's not really a lot, so this is something that we need to be worried.
NEUT18|So I think we would like to invest ago long, but it's but it's better now too old.
NEUT19|Please order this talk because there are even know very good news.
NEUT20|So 'cause based on fundamental analysis it seems that the reason why I jumped down this price be 'cause generating SCANA cat.
BEAR21|Three, 15,000 jobs, but anyway, the market is already discounted this news because you went at it when he went down and now he's going up again.
NEUT22|So so theoretically, this information is already.
BEAR23|It's been already discounted in the market, but anyway, General Electric is not going very well for different reasons because they were investing more in aviation.
BULL24|But now usually is in crisis, so they were expecting more money to get in from division Business partition business.
NEUT25|Now it's very, it's it's.
NEUT26|It's very slow.
NEUT27|I mean it's almost nothing, so this is.
BEAR28|Very bad news for General Electric was very bad ideas.
NEUT29|There was good years to 1019, but was there some previous?
NEUT30|Yes, there were.
BEAR31|No, it was not going very well.
BEAR32|So I think everybody is waiting to go longer in General Electric because the shares are very low.
NEUT33|About voter would suggest right now is just wait, hold.
NEUT34|Let's see if there will be some better signals to buy.
NEUT35|As it is we're standing right now.
BULL36|It seems that based on technical analysis, he might go up.
NEUT37|But again, fundamental analysis.
NEUT38|Generally they are not very good news around it.
NEUT39|This is my understanding of General Electric so far from my personal point of view, I would like to go to buy buy it's not right time, so let's hold it for now.
NEUT40|"Thanks, bye."""
