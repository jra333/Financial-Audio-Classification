NEUT0|"""Joining me is David Katz, the CIO at Matrix Asset Advisors, David Welcome, and Let's start with X on which you were afraid this might be coming right."
NEUT1|Well, for sure they weren't going to be raising the dividend.
NEUT2|Our concern is that sometime in 2021 oil prices don't pick up.
BEAR3|The company is not made affirm enough commitment to maintain that dividend in our dividend portfolio.
NEUT4|We really like absolute certainty, so our strong preference has been for Chevron and we did sell Exxon earlier this year and move that money into Chevron.
NEUT5|You moved it into Chevron so there are places in the energy Patch.
NEUT6|Would that be the only one?
BEAR7|Because there are some tantalizing yields as stock prices have collapsed there.
BULL8|Well, the energy sector has shown a clear propensity to cut the dividends if need be, so we think Chevron is absolutely safe.
BEAR9|Everything else in the Patch we're a little bit worried about.
NEUT10|The important thing is there are lots and lots of dividend paying.
BULL11|Companies are paying 3 1/2 to 4 1/2%, they're raising their dividends this year in a lot of other sectors, and we think those stocks have a lot of upside, and that's where we would be.
NEUT12|Putting our money.
NEUT13|Yeah, there's at least six names that you've flagged here, ranging on the lower dividend side from the likes of Coke and CVS and Kroger.
NEUT14|You know all the way up to AbbVie with a 6% yield, and all of these cases you think the dividends are safe.
NEUT15|The dividends are absolutely safe and most of them they've been raising him this year.
BULL16|Kellogg had a great quarter today.
NEUT17|They maintain the dividend this year.
NEUT18|We think they start to grow it again.
BULL19|Their business is doing very well.
NEUT20|All the companies that are on that list or actually doing very well as businesses in terms of.
BEAR21|Earnings and cash flow this year, yet the stocks have been left for dead.
NEUT22|We think that next year people are going to look at money markets that are paying 0 bonds that are paying less than 1% and say I need income.
NEUT23|How do I get that and start to go to dividend stocks?
BULL24|And we think it's going to be a multi year.
BULL25|Where these slow and steady dividend payers and earners are going to do very well as stocks.
NEUT26|A lot of them are selling at 1012 times earnings with the market at 18 to 20 times earnings.
NEUT27|So we think this is a lower risk way to be invested in the stock market.
BULL28|For the next one to two years, and the fact that they've done poorly this year and they really have as a group, means that they're really poised to do a lot better in the upcoming year.
NEUT29|You're not afraid you're gonna miss out on the second big tech rally, David.
NEUT30|We are not afraid they were going to get in on the big tech rally this year.
BEAR31|Technology and growth stocks have had their best outperformance since 1979, the last time you had anything close to this was the Internet bubble in 1999 and the next decade was pretty subpar for those groups.
NEUT32|So we think a lot of the growth stocks authority run their path.
NEUT33|They're pretty pricey, so we would not be plowing new money and we do own a lot of technology, but we're a lot less excited about the game going forward.
NEUT34|All right, David.
BULL35|Thank you, Sir.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
