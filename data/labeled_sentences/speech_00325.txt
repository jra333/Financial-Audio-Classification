BEAR0|"""The trading app Robin Hood not only in the news for its role in the frenzied trading around GameStop, AMC, and other speculative trades, but now Robin Hood has restricted trading in cryptocurrencies after Bitcoin it rose."
BULL1|It is up about 20% today an even Tesla's Elon Musk helping to move Bitcoin after a tweet.
NEUT2|We've got our Dan Roberts on the case, then it looks like Elon Musk is moving a lot of stocks lately, including GameStop.
NEUT3|Annette.
NEUT4|See.
NEUT5|What's the latest.
NEUT6|Yeah, Alexis.
NEUT7|Elon Musk changed his Twitter bio to just say hashtag Bitcoin, which certainly accelerated the surge.
NEUT8|I wouldn't attribute it all to Elon, but it probably had a big role here.
NEUT9|And the other token that has been surging in the last few days is Doge coin.
NEUT10|I feel ridiculous even saying it, but it's a meme based crypto that really has nothing behind it.
NEUT11|No company, no business, but it's been around since 2014 and has over the years had a number of times where the price surges like crazy.
BULL12|Yesterday was up more than 200%.
BULL13|Right now it's up about 100%.
NEUT14|Now, because of those two coins, although Robin Hood isn't explicitly saying that it's because of those two coins, Robin Hood this morning turned off the ability for customers to use its instant buying feature with crypto currencies.
NEUT15|So the way that works, and it is a paid feature on the app, it allows you to transfer funds from your bank account and instantly access them for buying of stocks or cryptocurrencies before the funds have actually settled, and so Robin Hood is turned that off at an in a blog post.
BEAR16|In a statement, it is cited extraordinary market conditions.
NEUT17|So obviously Robin Hood, saying, look.
NEUT18|This is to protect customers, but you know cryptocurrency users of the app are not pleased and it all comes after we know what happened yesterday.
NEUT19|It's the biggest story in business.
NEUT20|The mania with GameStop and you know Blockbuster and all these other names AMC These 90s nostalgia.
BEAR21|Some people called it the mall stocks that just went nuts after redditors kind of ganged up and said let's buy these names to stick it to the shorts and we know that yesterday Robin Hood temporarily halted buying of those names and courted a lot of wrath by doing so.
NEUT22|There has been discussion and debate over exactly why Robin Hood did it.
NEUT23|Most likely clearinghouse liquidity issue, but now hitting the crypto function.
NEUT24|Yes, it is alright.
BULL25|Thanks so much.
NEUT26|"Dan Roberts."""
