NEUT0|"""Yo, what is up guys back with another video and I just have a quick clip of Jim Cramer kind of talking about the Ark ETF Space ETF that is just come out recently."
NEUT1|He's also kind of been ******** on Kathy Woods and all that.
BEAR2|I know he's getting some hate on Twitter and Reddit.
NEUT3|Not a lot of people like him, but then at the same time he has a lot of fans and friends as well.
NEUT4|Kind of a boomer, but yeah, he just talks about the Ark Space ETF.
NEUT5|What he thinks about it.
NEUT6|It's pretty interesting.
NEUT7|Let me know what you guys think in the comments.
NEUT8|I found this on mad money and just sharing this with you guys 'cause I found it interesting.
NEUT9|Let me know what you guys think.
NEUT10|Make sure to like and subscribe and we'll see you in the next video.
NEUT11|Go ahead and watch this video piece 2nd.
NEUT12|Too much grief, yeah, one look at the newning launched Ark Space Exploration ETF tells you everything you need to know about how managers can't resist creating new funds.
NEUT13|Even if there's no reason for them to exist.
NEUT14|They love to create ETF so advertising, JTS.
NEUT15|Now like should this find out some quality companies that can pass this space place that got Trimble Craters defense L3 Harris so something like L3 is mainly a high defense contractor.
NEUT16|We have one you got Lockheed Martin and Boeing which Jews have some space exposure, even if it's not their main business.
NEUT17|The thing is, this fund also includes.
NEUT18|Amazon.
NEUT19|Alphabet.
NEUT20|And Netflix, along with some Chinese e-commerceplacejd.com, Alibaba, Tencent Deers in there too.
NEUT21|Yeah, Deere Tractor Company, it's ridiculous, but there aren't enough genuine space related stocks and make a decent ETF.
NEUT22|And the manager wants to collect that .75% expense ratio.
NEUT23|Maybe I don't get don't launch space ETF if you have to pad it out with Netflix and Dear, you know what?
NEUT24|I was surprised that GameStop isn't it, because GameStop is synonymous with rocket ships over at Wallstreetbets.
NEUT25|Yeah, well, it's not just your look, it's a ridiculous amount of risk.
NEUT26|The banks exposed themselves to with with this archegos hedge fund.
NEUT27|You know what that's about?
NEUT28|That's about greed.
BEAR29|The industry might have lost $10 billion here, and we know they were avoidable.
NEUT30|Why?
NEUT31|Because this funded not ensnare everybody.
BULL32|JP Morgan considered working with them and passed.
NEUT33|They exercise something.
NEUT34|I've been searching for this word all day 'cause it's not really available anymore on Wall Street judgment.
BEAR35|Something that is in very short supply and they decided this phone wasn't worth the risk.
NEUT36|They didn't trust Arculus they didn't trust it.
BEAR37|Everyone else chased those commissions with Moore and Credit Suisse getting hit particularly hard because they were so desperate to show that they are the go to banks for hedge funds that need absurd amounts of leverage sold to you.
NEUT38|Or how about the endless back attacks?
NEUT39|"I mean so many."""
