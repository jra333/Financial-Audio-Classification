NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel today.
NEUT2|Let's discuss Facebook because I feel as old Facebook is being left behind.
BEAR3|But as you can see, it's the only stock that I currently own that's easing upward and this is weird for Facebook because Facebook is just like Amazon in my opinion.
BEAR4|For the last six months has been very flat.
NEUT5|Let's go to the year chart you see from here all the way to the current time period has been really flat and we've seen periods like this where it goes up to 280, right?
NEUT6|In fact, we've seen it multiple times, 1/2, and even went up to 300, so I feel as old today.
NEUT7|It's a strange day because usually when it went into those points of 280 and 300 they were doing it was doing it with the whole sector, so all of the tech stack was moving up.
NEUT8|Not really sure why Facebook is moving up like this right now.
NEUT9|There's nothing in the news about the stock.
BULL10|I still think that Facebook is a good buy.
NEUT11|Maybe $283 is a little much to throw at the start.
BULL12|At this time, but I do see there being a pattern with Facebook and ease upward, even though we're going to.
NEUT13|We're going through a period where people are scared of inflation, so it's something to really keep in mind as you start to figure out which stops you should buy.
BULL14|I'm lucky enough to have bought Facebook about 7-8 months ago, so I still have a good margin of safety on this stock.
BEAR15|It's the only reason why I'm still holding on to the stock, because again, it's been flat for so long.
NEUT16|But in tech you can't really find any good.
BULL17|Stocks as of right now at good prices.
BEAR18|They're all kind of overvalued, and that is exactly why we're seeing the stock market stocks drop 8-9 percent.
NEUT19|You know, look at SQ.
BEAR20|4% square is a great company, but it moved up way too quickly.
NEUT21|You know, so be mindful of the stocks that you put in your money into, especially if it's the tech.
BULL22|But in terms of Facebook, I think that Facebook is a goodbye, even though it's a bit overvalued.
BULL23|I think that they're still doing great things.
NEUT24|They're trying to come up with their own cryptocurrency.
NEUT25|I'm not sure if they're still doing that, but their Oculus goggles and their advertising is just a masterpiece.
NEUT26|I think people sleep on that fact, and this is the reason why a lot of analysts think it's an 84% by.
NEUT27|I remember doing a lot of research before I've bought Facebook.
BEAR28|I did think it was going to be at 3:50 by now, but that's just one of those mistakes that I made Facebook along with Amazon have been to disappoint Are's.
BULL29|But I do think if you are planning to hold the stock for a very long time, it may be a good buy for you.
NEUT30|But just of course, do your own research and choose when you buy it wisely, because again, it's been very volatile.
NEUT31|The whole sector has been very volatile for the last for the last month and a half, so I hope you like an.
NEUT32|"I'll see you later."""
