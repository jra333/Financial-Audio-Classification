NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Dennis and today we're going to talk about the glue mobile."
NEUT1|Who is secure GL you market cap of $1.2 billion, zero income and sales $422 million book to share 1.4 no debt gross margin 64% here how's this talks look on a coffee and we can see that in 2016 there was 127 million shares and price was.
NEUT2|Around $3 and they publish more, more, more, and more stocks and the price now $9 point 48 really low, 1 short lot and we can see that when you grow extremely fast, like more than 10% in a year and I really like to buy stocks with this kind of girl, it is quite safe for elements that score more than 3.8.
NEUT3|And if we will check the sector now, they are $1.2 billion and we can see that they can.
NEUT4|Easily make extent in the future pictures.
NEUT5|They just publish knew game and I downloaded it to me.
NEUT6|And.
NEUT7|It is quite interesting.
NEUT8|Yeah, it is a sorcerer's Irina and I think this game will bring them lots of money.
NEUT9|Also they have lots of dash games, Deer Hunter and some classic games.
NEUT10|Gun Ambrose two now the public as their offering 15 million shares for Price 9.2.
NEUT11|That's why we can see this drawdown but I think it is like.
BULL12|Plus not minus, and we're already checked that they can grow even if they dilute their shares.
NEUT13|And this very interesting they published their results in Excel document.
NEUT14|It is quite interesting.
NEUT15|We can see here a guidance and it is really big.
NEUT16|They're planning to make $165 million in.
BULL17|Revenue in Q2 and it is like top results for them and we have guidance for $500 million in 2020 and it is more than 10% grow.
NEUT18|That's why I was thinking to buy the stock.
NEUT19|Here we can see bookings and now it is around $100 million.
BULL20|But with GNU game I think it will be a little bit higher in Q3 and Q4 total current assets.
NEUT21|$259 million total.
NEUT22|Current liabilities so 144 it is nothing suspicious here.
NEUT23|Maybe just a goodwill a little bit high.
BULL24|Anyway, we can see a slow but consistently they grow their equity and it is good too.
NEUT25|I think we don't need to watch on net income becauses it is a mobile games and they can rule their income very well I think.
NEUT26|We will make some profit, not from dividends.
NEUT27|I will make it from stub girl.
NEUT28|What do you think about Glu mobile?
NEUT29|And maybe it is not really good stock to buy, but I think it is really nice.
BULL30|They have lots of opportunities and really nice last game.
