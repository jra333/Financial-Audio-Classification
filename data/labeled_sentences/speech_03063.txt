NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clear in this video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, the very nice day on Facebook and not necessarily just because it was green on the day, but an I wanted to look at a bigger picture viewpoint of the chart because what essentially happened today?
NEUT4|Was that the price?
NEUT5|Got a break of a very stubborn area of resistance which if you go through the history of the sharp had been forming.
NEUT6|You know this pattern.
NEUT7|So 268 was that red line resistance right there and then the other part of the pattern was just the overall uptrend.
NEUT8|So what is known as the one?
NEUT9|A sending triangle here will actually let me get this changed to green 'cause to represent the support portion of the pattern.
NEUT10|But like I said that is what the price you know had been trapped in for basically the past several days.
NEUT11|But now with the clothes you can see that the price is now actually flirting with the top portion of that pattern.
NEUT12|Which brings about the more than valid the more than rational and really the wise question be asking is alright, hey, a break out his happen, but is this a true break?
NEUT13|Is this the start of something much bigger now?
NEUT14|A very well may not be, but my core point here at least makes sense.
NEUT15|It's a logical thought to be wondering, is this the start of something bigger?
NEUT16|Because there has been a breakout that's actually taking place.
NEUT17|So it just because a breakout takes place doesn't mean that it's for sure going to get bigger and bigger, but at least it's a, you know, it makes sense to be wondering the question you know, can this actually turn into something much bigger?
NEUT18|Is the price.
NEUT19|Is just at a random spot, then it doesn't really make sense to ask volcanic it bigger.
BULL20|Well bigger relative to what, but in this situation it's bigger relative to the pattern breakout.
NEUT21|So that will be the key dynamic to watch going forward and why 268 is a very important level and I'm not saying that this was going to happen, but if the price comes down to 268 and then just follows blow, it doesn't mean the entire charts ruined.
NEUT22|Absolutely not, but that would just be telling you that the breakout that happened today wasn't really a true breakout 'cause all of a sudden you have the price.
NEUT23|Well, right back inside of that pattern, and that's not what truly break.
NEUT24|You know, strong breakout moves do so.
NEUT25|268 definitely that important level that you want to see the price they up above.
NEUT26|But if this is indeed the sort of a bigger move, next key test.
NEUT27|Not until up there around the 274 marks will keep a close eye on that, but certainly an interesting pattern.
NEUT28|Certainly interesting price movement.
NEUT29|So let's see how things play out.
NEUT30|Moving forward.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT40|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live.
NEUT42|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT43|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT44|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT45|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
