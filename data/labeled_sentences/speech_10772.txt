NEUT0|"""Hello, this is how this video is a tutorial about the projects in CS230 are long term stock prediction based on financial statements."
BULL1|I'm sure yeah.
NEUT2|Here is our data set.
NEUT3|The data set comes from financial statements are there are balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement.
NEUT4|Balance sheet contains a city.
NEUT5|Data fields are related to assets, liabilities and equity.
NEUT6|Income statement contains about 18 or data fields related to expenses and income.
NEUT7|Cash flow statement contains 18 data fields are related to operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
NEUT8|One training item is composed by features from all three financial statements in three continuous years and the label is the percentage change in stock prices are between the last two years.
NEUT9|The task is trying to predict which category of stock belongs to.
NEUT10|So we got five categories here.
NEUT11|To take a closer look at the distribution of stock price change in one year looks like this.
BEAR12|We can see that most of the stocks around 0 for the price change in one year.
NEUT13|The model we use here he is 5 layer neural network.
NEUT14|Steam layer and layer with your 8.1 and a full connecting neural network layer and then another job or a layer with dropout rate .1 and then a softmax layer.
NEUT15|So two data augmentation techniques were applied applied here.
NEUT16|So one is to erase out some data fields.
NEUT17|Which is like a set of zero and the other is to add random noise into some data fields.
NEUT18|Here is the training accuracy that we get so.
NEUT19|And here is the confusion matrix.
BEAR20|We can see that most of the incorrect prediction falls into the second category and the category they could be due to the fact that many stocks have an annual percentage change close to 0.
NEUT21|Other models how he explored this one is to double the number of nodes from the basic model.
NEUT22|And this one is to kind of have in the number of nodes from the basic model.
NEUT23|And this one is to cut the dropout layers are from the base model.
NEUT24|And this one is 2 at LS Team Layer and Dropout layer in the basic model.
NEUT25|And this one is to at a full connected layer and algebra layer in the base model.
NEUT26|So we got some data in model comparison.
BULL27|We can see that model a basic model actually performs the best on test set.
NEUT28|And all the related codes could be found in my GitHub.
BULL29|"Thanks for watching."""
