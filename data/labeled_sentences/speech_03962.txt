NEUT0|"""So what is a power earnings gap and how to play it?"
BEAR1|A power earnings gap is when a stock rise up so high after earnings.
BEAR2|At least a big gap in the charts.
NEUT3|Right here the big gap.
BULL4|The bigger the gap, the better, and the more volume, the better and you see the volume is huge that day.
BULL5|Also we should close at the intraday high.
NEUT6|And stop giving it all back during the day.
BULL7|That's when you know you found your play earnings are coming up.
NEUT8|So be on the watch after PG.
NEUT9|The start will accumulate a bit, then continue.
NEUT10|Break out one or two more times, accumulating here.
NEUT11|It is during this accumulation.
NEUT12|That you will find entry invite for another breakout.
NEUT13|This happens within a month, so you can look back at data.
NEUT14|You'll see this happens 95% of the time.
NEUT15|So for Netflix my price target is 600.
NEUT16|That's where I see the resistance.
NEUT17|Once the brakes done, 600 would be a trading floor.
BEAR18|"But one thing you need to keep in mind if the market crashes it will also bring down Netflix."""
