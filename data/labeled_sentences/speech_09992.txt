BULL0|"""Anyway, Tesla shares are surging after the company's 5 for one split took effect yesterday."
BEAR1|We all knew this was coming, but trading as you might have anticipated, was a little heavier than normal during Monday's session, Tesla shares changed hands 115.6 million times.
BULL2|That is well above its 30 day volume average of about 73 million.
BULL3|Also, the stock rose by about 12 1/2 percent during yesterday's session.
BULL4|With today's move, the stock is actually sitting at a position.
BULL5|Of annual gains, yearly gains more than 530% and the company's market cap crossing $464 billion, passing visa to become the 7th largest U.S. company.
NEUT6|And with that stock move Elon Musk, by the way, he becomes the third richest person in the world, at least on paper.
NEUT7|Check that out.
NEUT8|Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, then Elon Musk.
NEUT9|Then Mark Zuckerberg.
NEUT10|Shares of Apple.
BULL11|Also getting a boost on stock split day.
NEUT12|Go ahead.
NEUT13|I was just going to say the crazy thing is in terms of year today, obviously, plus more than 400 percent, 80%.
NEUT14|Now with this morning, 6 1/2 percent gain, or 79% since they announced the stock split on just August the 11th, I mean unbelievable.
NEUT15|And the big difference between the last couple of trading days yesterday and today, of course, is anyone that that was critical of the idea of rallying so **** ** a stock split, and that this would be a sort of by the rumor.
BEAR16|Sell the fact type moment has also been proven wrong.
BULL17|It it rallied strongly yesterday, the day of the stocks, but taking hold and also rallied.
BULL18|Clearly it's going to rally today.
NEUT19|The one other thing that I thought was quite amusing is if you use Google Finance.
NEUT20|That stock shot didn't incorporate the stock split and some people yesterday.
BEAR21|On Twitter, returns is getting very worried that they thought their Tesla share price had collapsed massively from well over 2000 to down 500, and some people having some fun on Twitter about that.
BEAR22|People think worried that their their recent investment had collapsed roughly to 1/5 of the level that it had been and not realizing that the stocks but had taken hold.
NEUT23|Instead, it says that you know that, yeah?
NEUT24|Yeah, well they should be watching CNBC.
NEUT25|I mean and use the CNBC app, by the way, which is free to download and is great.
NEUT26|Awesome that aside, I talked to.
NEUT27|I talked to a trader last night who deals with shorting Tesla.
NEUT28|He said, you know, whenever you have a stock split, I think Art Cashin said this yesterday on air as well.
NEUT29|Whenever you have a split, if you have a stock that is heavily shorted, you got all kinds of problems because people have either put it into a basket of derivatives or they have some sort of a special financing plan on their short.
NEUT30|So when you announce a split, it can throw things a little bit.
NEUT31|I guess the technical term is haywire.
NEUT32|And so this guy was spending pretty much all day yesterday trying to redo deals on Tesla shorts.
NEUT33|I'm going to talk about, you know, guy, trying to short 5 shares.
NEUT34|I'm talking about huge companies either shorting it or putting it in a basket, derivatives or a D1 type product or whatever it might be, and so that might just be if you are long Tesla, just know that pop some of that.
NEUT35|I won't call it short covering because that's not what it is, but certainly the redoing ideals of people who are long or heavily done.
NEUT36|Tesla shorts.
NEUT37|It's a very inexpensive stock to short believe it or not.
NEUT38|"Because nobody wants to get in front of a moving freight train."""
