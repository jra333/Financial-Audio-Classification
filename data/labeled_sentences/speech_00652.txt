NEUT0|"""What is going to happen to welcome back the stock trends channel?"
NEUT1|So in this video we're going over ticker symbol S&EL sundial growers.
NEUT2|This stock has been getting a lot of attention in the past couple of days and past couple of weeks as we've seen a couple of different runs to the upside indicated by a couple weeks ago.
BULL3|Hitting highs here at $0.85 premarket, pulling back down to the mid 20s, popping and then starting to make a bigger move, hitting highs just shy of $1.00, up around 9798 cents just a few days ago.
NEUT4|So we want to talk about what's going on here, why the stock is moving on.
NEUT5|And some of the potential drivers for the stock price in the near term.
NEUT6|It really quick if you would not mind jumping down subscribing to the channel, hitting the thumbs up button and grabbing your four free stocks, or with Weibel.
NEUT7|That's the platform that we are using right now to talk about this stock that's linked in the pinned comment description box down below.
NEUT8|So really quick, we're talking about a stock that's been getting a lot more attention as the more act has been circulating through Congress and actually has recently made it through the House.
BULL9|It has gotten to the amount of votes needed to pass in the House.
BULL10|However, the house is more favored democratically.
NEUT11|And we have to expect that this does not pass through the Senate, as there are more Republicans and it looks as if science point that not happening.
NEUT12|But again, we'll have to see how things play out in the coming days and weeks.
BULL13|However, SMDL has recently filed for the ability to offer.
NEUT14|What does that actually mean?
BULL15|Well, they've actually filed for and offering means they can offer more shares, potentially driving the stock price.
BEAR16|Dallas, there's more supply that will potentially drive the stock price down.
NEUT17|However, we have this line right here.
NEUT18|The 60 cent.
NEUT19|Line where did this come from?
NEUT20|If we take a look and we look to some of the recent highs actually a couple weeks ago we had a high of $0.60, so previous area of resistance becomes new support.
NEUT21|So when we go back to the four hour chart and we look at where we actually just came down to, we felt just that 60 cent level.
NEUT22|If we do fall below what seems to be $0.60 then we want to look for this $0.50 as previous high right here, around $0.50, also $0.50 and a lot of penny stocks is generally natural area of support and resistance.
BEAR23|And then if we do fall below there we have some strong support down around 28 to 24 or so sense.
BULL24|Well, we did find some support back in here.
BEAR25|If we do come down that far, we saw a pretty significant sell the news event with a lot of these MJ stocks.
NEUT26|ACB, TLR, why HEXO, IDC, and there's plenty of other ones as well that followed a similar category in the cannabis space.
BEAR27|However, as we kind of got into Friday and push towards that actual result, we sell stocks falling off towards the end of the day, even though it did pass through the house often times for situations like this you'll see a bigger run up in anticipation of the vote.
NEUT28|And then when we actually get the vote, we see a further sell off.
NEUT29|So it looks like right now we're going to have to make a pop back to the upside.
BEAR30|Breaking back over $0.85, which seems to be a tough area right in here.
BULL31|Prior area of resistance back up here a few weeks ago.
BEAR32|$0.85 past couple of days was an error we couldn't break above.
NEUT33|And then after that looks like $0.97 and eventually $1.00.
NEUT34|If we do resume back to the upside, it seems like these stocks are all pulling back so it would not surprise me to see these stocks pulling back through the rest of December before potential another round as we move into 2021.
NEUT35|So again, if you are ready to be on lookout for that 60 cent support to crack, then watch $0.50 and also stay tuned to news to see if they do have an offering.
BEAR36|If they do Drop Inn offering, you'll probably see the stock price collapse pretty quickly.
NEUT37|That is something that is very common with stocks that release offerings.
