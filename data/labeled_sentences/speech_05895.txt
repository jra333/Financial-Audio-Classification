NEUT0|"""Next question comes from Josh."
NEUT1|I have a question about dividend yields.
NEUT2|I often see them written out as a percentage.
NEUT3|For instance, I see on full.com that 18 T currently has a dividend yield of 6.2%.
NEUT4|Is that equivalent to an interest rate?
NEUT5|With banks still paying less than 2% to 6%, interest rate sounds great, but I'm not sure if a dividend yield is essentially the same thing.
NEUT6|That's a good question.
NEUT7|In short, it is essentially the same thing and that you are either going to get paid for having your money in a savings account or with a CD, or you're going to get paid by a company who offers a dividend for hanging on to their stock.
NEUT8|Now typically a company is going to pay a dividend four times a year, once every quarter, and that rate or that percentage that you see.
NEUT9|The yield is the it's based on the amount that they pay out compared to the stock price, so that can certainly fluctuate, but generally speaking, particularly in today's.
BULL10|Interest rate environment dividends are far more attractive option an.
BULL11|I think they will be that way for some time to come because even though rates will continue to go up, they will go up fairly slowly in companies.
NEUT12|Generally speaking, these companies that pay dividends are pretty reliable.
BULL13|Their business models produce some pretty reliable cash flows that allow them to keep paying those dividends and oftentimes raising those dividends.
NEUT14|So if you really want to find the awesome dividend companies you look for the dividend aristocrats and those are the companies that have grown those dividends.
NEUT15|For long periods of time, I think the qualifiers at 25 years.
NEUT16|Or is it 30 years to double check that.
BULL17|But anyway, they have a very long track record established of growing those dividends on an annual basis, so we'll probably have point in time where interest rates become a little bit more attractive.
NEUT18|And when that happens, you're very likely to see some of those dividend stocks.
NEUT19|Prices take a little bit of it as money starts to flow towards more risk free assets, but for now, and I think really as an investment strategy.
NEUT20|On the whole, it's always a good idea to.
BULL21|"A plan on owning some some good stayed dividend payers for long periods sign."""
