NEUT0|"""Thanks for watching this quick video on Rolls Royce Holdings."
NEUT1|We are in the US marketplace and as you can see this is the name of this stock are double LCF.
NEUT2|This is a shared type C, so it's a little bit more.
NEUT3|It's not like a normal share, but please again before you invest in this talk, read a lot of news and get confident that you understand what you're doing and where.
NEUT4|You are investing your money so these videos mainly based on technical analysis.
NEUT5|I will live with you the fundamental analysis and a little bit of theory behind this type of stock.
NEUT6|So in this situation we can see that there's been very volatile during last days and just using a simple technical analysis, let's see if we can predict the next step, taking analysis, telling you that it seems that we have started the bullish trend where?
NEUT7|Using using an exponential moving average of 100 work very well, as is working as support for a possible potential knew rarely, so let's see using technical analysis.
NEUT8|The possible scenario for this stock.
NEUT9|This is my interpretation and we got this new peak and now woken up.
NEUT10|It can happen if this one is going to work as possible to end align.
NEUT11|It means that if in the next days this distant line or we need one day or two days where this deadline will not.
NEUT12|Be broken, the idea would be to go long otherwise or wait, cause because it seems that we got this new momentum that we should use.
NEUT13|We got this high volatility and the idea is to long.
BEAR14|But if the trend line will be broken in the next days just old because the prices might go down up to again this level there.
NEUT15|So almost.
NEUT16|0.005 Let's see.
NEUT17|So the idea is old.
NEUT18|For now, wait if the distant line will not be broken Monday on Tuesday.
NEUT19|So next week if it will not be.
NEUT20|If it will not be broken, idea would be to go lock with target price of open one U.S. dollar.
NEUT21|So this is my technical analysis interpretation, but please read a lot of news about this type of stock and about Rolls Royce.
NEUT22|So if you want to compare it with the you can compare it with.
