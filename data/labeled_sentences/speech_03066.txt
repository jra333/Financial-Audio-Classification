NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, a crazy day on this one.
NEUT4|A good old fashioned gap in trap is what you know terminology would be used.
NEUT5|What do I mean by that?
NEUT6|Well on.
BEAR7|Friday the price closed right there this morning the price opened up there, hence a gap up and then after the opening Bell Rang.
NEUT8|This is where things get cruel because the price acted like it was strong and it was strong temporarily.
NEUT9|And then you know there are some poor souls buying up around here and then after that it was basically all selling pressure.
NEUT10|The rest of the day.
NEUT11|So gap and trap is like you said that the way I would summarize today's action in and of itself and a couple of key levels to watch now moving forward as far as support and resistance are.
NEUT12|Resistances are concerned.
NEUT13|First the area of support that I think a lot of people are going to watch it is right down there.
NEUT14|At the 266 cent mark, if you watch.
NEUT15|Or not to excuse me, $266 mark, but you can see right here.
NEUT16|Did a good job of holding that support once the price got back above it right there acted as support and then this big old diners movement basically stopped right there again at 266.
NEUT17|So point there being a lot of eyeballs watching that level.
NEUT18|And if that level can not quite hold up, then not a guarantee, but I don't think anybody would be shocked to see the price then potentially go down to the 263 marked.
NEUT19|So again, 266 one of those areas were no guarantees don't exist, but it's a more than valid and more than a rational thought.
BEAR20|That if the price does break down through there, that could create enough downside selling pressure, then trigger it.
NEUT21|You know to go down and right around the 263 mark.
NEUT22|Now in the event the price decides it wants to bounce back upwards.
NEUT23|As far as areas of resistance are concern, keep a close eye on that purple line right there.
NEUT24|The 50.
NEUT25|Moving average, which on my chart right now currently valued right up around the two 7150 ish mark, give or take a little bit.
NEUT26|But yeah, as of now 266 is really that level that I think a lot of lot of people are going to be watching myself included.
NEUT27|So let's see how the price behavior relative to it moving forward.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
