NEUT0|"""Joining me now on the Daily Ledger Page 5 beat from Nashville, TN."
NEUT1|Economic analyst, hedge fund manager and contributor to Forbes and other publications.
BEAR2|Thomas Land, St Tom China says it's pessimistic that there's going to be a trade deal done anytime soon.
BULL3|The White House says is very optimistic that there's going to be a trade deal soon no matter what.
NEUT4|If we look at farmers, let's look at our American farmers right now.
NEUT5|They're receiving subsidies, ensure the higher tariffs are quote paying for these subsidies, but this is a model that's not sustainable.
NEUT6|Write an in the end, the farmers need business, not subsidies.
NEUT7|So we've got to get this trade deal locked down sooner rather than later.
NEUT8|Please, it's not up to us alone.
NEUT9|You know how sceptical all along a bit about this right here we go again.
BULL10|Just yesterday this in Wod news agency said we were closer.
NEUT11|Now today they say we're not close.
NEUT12|Trump says we're closed.
BULL13|Kudlow says we're close.
NEUT14|I would too.
NEUT15|I would try to calm the markets by saying we're close.
NEUT16|We're not close.
NEUT17|It doesn't look like we're close.
NEUT18|That same article several articles insinuated that China was looking at the impeachment hearing.
NEUT19|So looks like to me, China's biggest ally in this trade war.
NEUT20|Is Adam Schiff an impeachment and you got to think?
NEUT21|What would you do?
NEUT22|What would you do if you were on their side?
NEUT23|Coraline.
NEUT24|Wait yeah.
NEUT25|Oh yeah.
BULL26|Yeah, I know you're going to.
NEUT27|You're going to find out and see what the political outcome is for sure.
BEAR28|But the farmers are cut caught in the middle.
BEAR29|And we know from reporting that their incomes are dropping during this process.
BEAR30|And bankruptcies are increasing.
NEUT31|You're right and this is going to be controversial, Graham, but I don't have a lot of sympathy for the farmers.
NEUT32|I've got a lot of family that were farmers and our farmers and they would agree that they are the biggest recipients of corporate welfare of any industrial group.
NEUT33|The story of farming and the boom bust cycle.
NEUT34|We've just been through is more a story of the ethanol mandate which was signed in 2007.
BEAR35|It diverted 40% of the corn crop away from the food supply and corn, soybeans, wheat, hay prices all shot up 3.
BEAR36|100% Iowa Farm shut up.
NEUT37|300% farmers thought it would go on forever.
BULL38|They went and bought brand new slick equipment from Caterpillar and John Deere and case New Holland and it was an absolute **** of spending among the farmers about the Iowa farmland hit like over 11,012 thousand an acre.
NEUT39|You had New York hedge funds speculating on that farm land was an absolute frenzy.
NEUT40|And then in July of 2013 the head of the EPA froze the mandate and corn prices.
NEUT41|Boom, they went from 7 and a quarter back to three and a half.
NEUT42|That's where they've been the whole time.
NEUT43|So then you know they tried to bail themselves out by taking on more debt in this easy money world.
NEUT44|And here we have it.
NEUT45|That's the story of the farm belt.
NEUT46|It really is.
NEUT47|You got it.
NEUT48|People have to understand it's a lot more than just the tariffs.
NEUT49|Ethanol mandate really should be undone.
BEAR50|It's a disaster for the American people.
NEUT51|And oh, by the way, it costs more to produce ethanol than what they're ostensibly saving in terms of energy.
NEUT52|By making ethanol in the 1st place, it's an.
NEUT53|Absolute disaster needs to be undone.
