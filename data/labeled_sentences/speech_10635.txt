BEAR0|"""You when you mentioned testing Jim, are you unnerved at all by Elon Musk's tweets seeming to question the quality of testing in this country."
NEUT1|Well, not a PC, ours is.
BULL2|You know, I think PCR is really, really strong.
NEUT3|The antigen tests I do not trust.
NEUT4|I just don't trust them, so I I agree with him.
NEUT5|Antigen is really very erratic and I think that we should not feel take any confidence in antigen test.
BEAR6|I know that the people who produce those will hate what I just said.
BEAR7|I'm sorry, antigen test.
NEUT8|No PCR test yes member.
NEUT9|Take a look at the number of people in the NFL.
NEUT10|Remember NFL was just team after team after team.
NEUT11|Now you'll get one maybe 2 the NFL test PCR seven days a week.
NEUT12|Initially they did three days then they went five.
NEUT13|Now they do.
NEUT14|Seven PCR is a method that had no one is disputed.
NEUT15|But he wants right on the antigen you you can have wildly wildly erratic numbers, so I think he's once again he's right.
NEUT16|He's no longer erratic.
BULL17|Antigens erratic, 91 model well Jim.
NEUT18|I mean we may love Elon Musk and we talk about him a lot.
NEUT19|But this is the same man who back in March said that cases would go to zero by April, which people have not forgotten.
NEUT20|No, he is not being.
NEUT21|I would say he's been much more with President Trump on that he's been wrong.
NEUT22|He didn't, he wasn't.
NEUT23|Ventilator is not a big issue and he really thought this thing was going to run out.
BEAR24|I'm loath to criticize him if only just because he's right on a lot of others.
NEUT25|He got this one wrong.
NEUT26|Ivy should be rolling hydrogen.
NEUT27|I think hydrogen can be very big.
BEAR28|I think he's making a mistake that has to be electric at the same time we cannot avoid what's happening with Neo.
BEAR29|We can't do that we had with Fisker the anyone of these electric is just going insane.
NEUT30|Remember Nicolas hydrogen?
NEUT31|I think he is a great fuel because it's green.
NEUT32|Eye vision is very very expensive but very good.
NEUT33|But I think that you want is going to be wrong by just focusing on electric right that?
NEUT34|Management is way overstated is a good way to do things.
NEUT35|Paper that I said that they will hate me.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
