NEUT0|"""So let's talk about Tesla."
NEUT1|Then you said that you were only going to buy the dip.
BEAR2|Are you going to continue to buy the Tesla dip now that it's dipping even lower?
NEUT3|Yes, we can buy a stock up to 10% of our portfolios, and that's certainly in the ETF's.
NEUT4|We were report our Holdings at the end of every day, so anyone can see that.
BULL5|And yes, we have been building whenever we can.
BULL6|Now we built up to 10% last week, so the stock behaved in line with our portfolio, so again we can't buy anymore here.
BEAR7|If it were to deteriorate at a rate.
BEAR8|Beyond that of our other portfolio, so drop below that 10%.
NEUT9|We would then have the latitude to buy more of course.
NEUT10|Now you've said you're going to put out a new Tesla price target.
NEUT11|The market is anxiously waiting for that.
NEUT12|When are we going to see that?
NEUT13|Can you give us an idea of what the target will be?
NEUT14|Well, it's going to be in.
NEUT15|I'm going to say a couple of weeks we're getting.
NEUT16|Compliance is helping us cross our T's dot our eyes and do everything we should do before we before we send it out.
NEUT17|But the two things that have happened to Tesla since our last projections are one.
BULL18|It has increased its market share when we put out our original $4000.
NEUT19|Price targets the equivalent of $800.
BEAR20|Now we thought that that Tesla share would drop from 17%.
NEUT21|This is share of the electric vehicle market global electric vehicle market from 17% then to 11%.
BULL22|Instead its share increased as others with wonderful brand names started increasing.
NEUT23|The number of electric vehicles in in their companies so that.
NEUT24|That was a big big wake up in the United States.
NEUT25|I think Tesla through the third quarter at least was still 80% of all electric vehicles sold in the United States.
NEUT26|So pretty stunning.
NEUT27|The second thing that has happened is autonomous.
NEUT28|Are the probability that Tesla gets autonomous right?
BULL29|We believe has increased from the 30% that we had in our base case in our last model, so.
NEUT30|But what's interesting about autonomous is the margins.
NEUT31|In autonomous, the gross margins are in that 80% range.
BULL32|The margins for electric vehicles alone are in the 25 to 30% range.
NEUT33|This is a five year projection, so the model changes completely.
BULL34|"If Tesla gets autonomous right, and we think it will OK."""
