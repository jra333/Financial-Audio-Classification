NEUT0|"""Most American companies diversified away from Europe a long, long time ago."
BULL1|Remember, even before Covid had kovid the eurozone have been limping along for years, Europe hasn't been a great growth engine in ages.
NEUT2|Not say it's unimportant.
NEUT3|There's a lot of people said that 100,000,000 people there.
BEAR4|But American firms that try to do business there often end up getting burned, like when GE Fools who bought that album for far more than it was worth and wasn't able to rationalize it all.
BEAR5|They're still paying the price for that stupid acquisition.
NEUT6|Sure, the Consumer Packaged Goods plays move a lot of merchandise over there, but they won't be hurt by recession.
NEUT7|Same goes for McDonald's for Nike for Starbucks 5th.
NEUT8|Finally, our big tech companies still do tons of business in Europe, but these are all stay at home economy stories.
NEUT9|The biggest threat to them is the European regulators.
BEAR10|France and the Netherlands just reached a deal to go after 20 American tech companies for unfair practices.
NEUT11|What we see this before and usually the problem goes away after our tech firms pay some kind of fine.
BEAR12|It's a shakedown.
NEUT13|Europe doesn't have a tech sector that can rival ours, so it's not like they can take the.
NEUT14|Pigeons houseware but periodically they get hit up for big money.
NEUT15|No big deal.
NEUT16|Business as usual.
NEUT17|Check please all that said, yes Kovid is making a third run at us.
NEUT18|Here we're still jokers when it comes to testing and contact tracing.
NEUT19|I look, I call it like it really is all right.
NEUT20|Junkers OK, I'm not gonna mince words.
NEUT21|200,000 people die for everything.
NEUT22|We don't have a national strategy in every state.
NEUT23|It's like it's like if Montana where to fight against Japan in Montan, Nebraska was going against Germany in World War Two.
NEUT24|That's kind of what we're doing.
NEUT25|Yeah, I don't think it's sufficient, but unlike Europe, we've gotten used to the pandemic because it never really went away.
BULL26|We spent months coming up with coping strategies to protect our most vulnerable.
NEUT27|In Europe they thought they had the virus beaten.
NEUT28|They had months where things were almost back to normal and now the code it's come roaring back.
NEUT29|It's like the reliving what happened in March.
NEUT30|The bottom line.
NEUT31|On a day like today where the morning traders foolishly dump everything, you've got to pounce and do some buying.
NEUT32|I don't know when the next Bible tip will come along, but when it happens and it's one of these ones with the pajama traders 'cause it, I want you to be ready.
