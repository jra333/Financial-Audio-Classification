NEUT0|"""For most investors, I think you still want to be cautious out there, but there's two areas I think we're not focusing on enough."
NEUT1|If I major one is those people who entered this defensively and have a massive appetite for volatility, they're starting to be real pockets of value, and they should be looking at that on the other side, those who are still holding on to corporate credit with really weak balance sheets and don't want to sell because their prices have plunged.
NEUT2|Remember one thing.
BEAR3|The earnings picture is being absorbed.
NEUT4|The next round is the balance sheet picture and the false are really destructive of value.
NEUT5|And if you still in these very low rated companies who have no cash debt maturing, you're betting on bailouts and you're betting on generous bailouts.
NEUT6|Understand what you're betting on, because this is a very tough environment, not just for earnings but for balance sheets.
NEUT7|Right?
NEUT8|And.
NEUT9|In the end.
NEUT10|Do you really?
NEUT11|I mean, she just you.
NEUT12|Should you just assume that these politicians are going to get it together?
NEUT13|I mean if they don't, it could be what you just described would not happen, but for some reason it just seems like eventually that old expression that.
NEUT14|They'll eventually do what's right after looking at all the alternatives and finally settling on that.
NEUT15|Is it right?
BULL16|Yeah, I'm pretty confident that this is going to be the same as we saw with top.
NEUT17|The first one doesn't get through, then the market gives a very clear signal, but it's not the market.
NEUT18|I've participated in a number of town halls.
BEAR19|People are suffering.
BEAR20|There is real pain in the street.
BEAR21|This is an economic sudden stop that takes away your likelihood that makes you feel insecure.
BEAR22|That takes away goods from shelves.
BULL23|"I mean, this is a real hit and people are looking to Washington to do something."""
