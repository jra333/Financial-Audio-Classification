NEUT0|"""OK, so today you might as well."
BEAR1|Netflix earnings take a little dump after hours and three honest, the earnings weren't that bad at all.
NEUT2|As you can see, I got like a fractional share of Netflix.
BULL3|You know, just for some quick gains and I'm already up 2% from my position, which is really good and the current price of Netflix is 479.58 and the previous highs it's been 525.40.
BEAR4|I think this is basically just a correction oversold thing.
NEUT5|You know Netflix was really, truly like taken over Heights high and you take a look at it was up for 560 to $568.
NEUT6|And if you look at the month, it barely like has its month gains at all, and this was really just over, you know, over reaction.
BULL7|I think Netflix will honestly bounce back up to where it was.
NEUT8|There's really no point in panic selling Netflix at all, especially 'cause it's the main focus of this pandemic.
NEUT9|With people you know watching Netflix all day.
NEUT10|So I will show you the news right now.
NEUT11|An yeah.
NEUT12|So as you can see here, Netflix call has tastings in for a decade.
BEAR13|The sub strong, despite apparent pull forward Netflix shares were down 9% as its posted its quarter 2 earnings.
BEAR14|And basically you know the quarter 2 earnings weren't that bad.
NEUT15|It needed, you know, more than 10 million subscribers for it.
NEUT16|You know its own program.
NEUT17|Which is basically just like 5,000,000 as a estimate.
NEUT18|They still have about 2 billion to spend, which is a giant Mount, like if you if you think companies think that 2 billion is nothing in amounts of money, you clear quite wrong on that because 2 billion is a lot of money.
BULL19|And you know they still say you know to you know, improve their Netflix.
NEUT20|Any revenue upside will tend to put more content for members, which generates more growth over time.
BULL21|We've been pretty been pretty good about taking the upside and converting it into an more growth, so that would be the plan.
NEUT22|So this seems that what with how this executive is talking, it seems that he's pretty confident that Netflix is going to go up.
NEUT23|That's why people decided to, you know, buy Netflix after.
NEUT24|Hours and you take a look at the options chain.
BEAR25|You know if you bought puts you may have been printing money because this suffered such a heavy drop, but the puts were so expensive to the point that I don't even know if it would generate that money.
NEUT26|But people are most likely sitting at a double, you know, reward right here.
NEUT27|I think what I'm gonna do.
NEUT28|Personally, I'm going to buy some calls afterwards, so but take a look at this.
NEUT29|The premium is 5.
BEAR30|$5000, but I think this will drop heavily due to the Ivy Crush.
NEUT31|And yeah I think I'm going to hop on on like a 520 call for July 24th, but even that I think I might take a July 31st call so I can be more safe with my investment.
NEUT32|So I'll be looking for around $550 or if I take a July 24th call, almost likely play in the money instead of out the money so I can be safer in case it does drop.
NEUT33|So yeah, that's what I'm thinking of Netflix stock.
NEUT34|Subscribe if you knew, like if you like the video and I'm going to come out with more content.
NEUT35|"So peace."""
