NEUT0|"""Apple is going back to the future I guess with a phone that gets actually smaller, not bigger."
NEUT1|A lower price point.
NEUT2|Will it work?
BULL3|Yeah, we believe it will.
NEUT4|You know.
BULL5|Especially having the wider range we've seen with the last adoption the iPhone has seen the off cycle.
BULL6|It's had pretty good adoption people, you know, not everyone wants a larger screen.
BULL7|We still expect that base 12 to have, you know, the best performance out of all the models and the Pro.
NEUT8|The Pro Max you know with better cameras I don't think you can discount the you know the selling feature of a better camera as well.
NEUT9|But yeah, we think that it's a nice a nice add on as well.
BULL10|And then with the 12 in the better base model it's $100 more expensive than last year should help the average ASP as well.
BEAR11|Yeah, and you've got these phones down.
NEUT12|I guess the you said ASP average selling price and I think what some people obviously not you, but some are concerned about a bit as those margins, right?
NEUT13|It's not about sales or revenue, it's about gross margins.
NEUT14|Is Apple smart to sort of lure people to buying lower cost phones?
NEUT15|You know it is relatively speaking.
BULL16|They are still trending up over the past years.
NEUT17|If you think of, you know, a few years ago the phones are still more expensive.
NEUT18|You have storage upgrades as well.
NEUT19|You'd also have that premium tier with the Pro which should help out.
NEUT20|You know one thing that they have done as well, they've taken out the charging block and the earphones.
BULL21|That should help.
BULL22|Some of the margins to some extent.
NEUT23|They have painted as an environmental play, which I believe is fully true.
NEUT24|However, those should also be incremental pieces.
BULL25|That should help out with the margin cost as well.
NEUT26|And also you know shipping costs with.
NEUT27|You know more fillings propelled at National Health?
NEUT28|Yeah, and you think about the idea of maybe even maybe you're right, not a lower cost phone, but certain 700 bucks at low price by the way.
NEUT29|But you know what I'm saying?
NEUT30|Get people into that Apple ecosystem.
NEUT31|And then if all of our viewers right now today that use Apple products, go on to their computer iTunes account, look at their subscriptions.
NEUT32|They'll probably realize they're paying Apple 25 to 50 bucks a month in recurring revenue for news.
NEUT33|I cloud Apple music.
NEUT34|Apple Music match and not even realizing it.
NEUT35|Getting people into that Halo.
NEUT36|Robert, I got to imagine is the whole deal.
NEUT37|It absolutely is.
NEUT38|You know, one of our positive viewpoints on Apple is that the cash flows even though it is a product that you're purchasing.
NEUT39|You know the pretty highly recurring.
NEUT40|You know, we even think about it to some extent.
NEUT41|The lumpy annuity where you're having that you know seven $800 outlay every two 3-4 years.
NEUT42|But we when you mentioned the services, yes, you know they're coming out with the Apple one bundle coming soon, $30 a month and it's pretty easy to justify RM already at $10 for cloud storage, maybe $5 for TV for an incremental $1015.00 I'm getting you know a wider suite of services.
NEUT43|We actually did a deep dive earlier this week on the fitness opportunity.
BULL44|Which we think could you know, potentially a $3 billion revenue opportunity by 2023.
NEUT45|But then again, you know that's kind of the prime feature of if you have fitness.
NEUT46|If you have the cloud storage, what's another $510 a month to get the you know music news in the arcade as well?
NEUT47|How much more upside is the stock have?
NEUT48|So the valuation is always tougher on this name, but right now you know our positive viewpoint is really built around the fact that we're right at the front of this super cycle.
BULL49|You know we're very bullish on 5G.
BULL50|We think it's going to be a multi year upgrade cycle.
NEUT51|This is not a one and done year with the 12.
NEUT52|Yes, the valuation is tighter, but it's a name that we want to be a part of right now.
NEUT53|You know they can grow into earnings.
BULL54|It has a lot of buyback power that should help out the EPS.
NEUT55|So if you look at it over the next several years, you know if you get new product innovation announcements.
NEUT56|I think it's in that will work.
NEUT57|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT58|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
