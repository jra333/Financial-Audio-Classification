NEUT0|"""Hi there, Jason Moser analyst with Motley Fool one, and thanks again for joining us for another edition of Ask a fool today we're taking a question from Jeff Massingill and Jeff asks if every shares owned 100% of the time, then what is a sell off and how?"
NEUT1|Our share price is determined and Jeff goes on to know the figure that selling was what made prices go down.
BULL2|Buying made prices go up.
NEUT3|Jeff, I understand your question, but let's look at one part of your question and I think this may help you better understand the nature of a sell off on how this works.
NEUT4|So when you said I always thought selling reduced the price, buying drove prices up.
NEUT5|So in some cases yes, buying will drive prices up, but that's when a stock is in demand.
NEUT6|Now let's look at a stock, for example, that delivers a really poor earnings report and then to top it all off, they announced an SEC investigation into its accounting practices.
BEAR7|So really, there's just a lot of bad news here, and this prompts investors to head for the exits on the stock all at once.
NEUT8|Think about this, they just say there's too much bad news.
NEUT9|And here I want to get out.
NEUT10|And so they all start selling.
NEUT11|Now you think about the fact there's going to be some serious volume here.
NEUT12|A lot of shares hitting the market and with all of these sellers starting to sell at once.
NEUT13|The action here is in the selling.
BEAR14|The selling is driving the prices down.
NEUT15|Now for every seller there is a buyer and that's always worth remembering in the stock market.
NEUT16|But it's also fundamental negotiation at work here.
NEUT17|Buyers of this stock are only going to buy when they feel that the price represents enough of a bargain to account for whatever risks that may be involved in buying the stock.
BULL18|After all that bad news, so buying here isn't pushing up the prices.
NEUT19|It's actually soaking up the inventory of all the selling of all the shares that are being offered up for sale because the sellers went out no matter what.
NEUT20|So it's kind of like being a forced seller in a situation you just don't want that to happen because you have no real power in the negotiation.
NEUT21|I hope that clears it up for it's very interesting question and I certainly enjoyed thinking about it.
