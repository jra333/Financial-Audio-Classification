NEUT0|"""List of guys should boil well back in the video today."
NEUT1|Today I will be talking about GameStop stock and I'm gonna give you guys my game stock stock analysts and some predictions that I see going forward.
NEUT2|So make sure you guys like the video that subscribe and turn post notifications so you don't miss any updates.
NEUT3|And let's get into it.
NEUT4|So I had this level that I wanted to buy off of.
BEAR5|This level was 4543 and man, this chart just looks so nasty when you look at it.
NEUT6|In the long term view, just crazy, but today.
NEUT7|I wasn't watching it because I was on AMC as you guys know in the previous video.
NEUT8|Before this, the AMC play that I did.
NEUT9|But as you can see this level is 4543.
NEUT10|And look at the after hours.
BULL11|It came around the 4948 level.
NEUT12|An it quickly rejected.
BEAR13|It came back down almost close to the lower that we had down here and then rejected it again.
BEAR14|So I think there is some buying pressure around this level right here.
NEUT15|Could look closely got and then it rejected it.
NEUT16|So I want to see how price reacts at this 4543 level and if I see some up movement like.
NEUT17|Something like this?
NEUT18|Sum up movement, then I'll try to get in on a quick intraday play on GameStop stock.
NEUT19|And just get in for a quick play.
NEUT20|OK, I want to get like a run like this.
NEUT21|Just the intraday run.
NEUT22|This was about 15% so looking to make about 10% on the money that I put in which is very good if you can make.
BULL23|Like 20% a year on your money, you're doing very well.
BULL24|OK, always know steady, successful profits is way better consistent.
NEUT25|OK so for game stock I'm watching this level and this level will tell me how GameStop will play out.
NEUT26|Also this this talk is very risky, so this is the level might not even hold up.
NEUT27|We don't know for sure really.
NEUT28|Don't know what's going on with GameStop stock, so I'm really just watching this level for me.
NEUT29|And if I do see start, start seeing some buying like I told you.
NEUT30|Like this I will get in for a quick scout of that day so I'm just waiting to see how Monday plays out, but I do think if price goes over $100.
NEUT31|I think this was the key resistance level.
NEUT32|As you can see, it hasn't really want to gone up over $100 since the come down, so we need to watch that $100 area and then you should watch this area.
NEUT33|OK, so that's how I'm playing games outside Kobe.
NEUT34|Guys like the video and remember none of this recommendation of our so anything.
NEUT35|This educational purposes only.
NEUT36|So do not trade anything you see here in these videos.
NEUT37|"And I catch you guys in the next one."""
