NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well talked about this green line on Thursday an how $29.00 were starting to be threatened and it became a question of, you know, is this the start of something bigger?
NEUT5|Are the Bears getting ready to take over?
BEAR6|And yeah, that was the leading indicator that the Bears are getting ready to make another push downwards because that level was absolutely destroyed today.
NEUT7|So the first thing to do is actually just bring this down to the Now the next level of support.
NEUT8|That lots and lots and lots of people are going to be watching and that is right down here at that $127.00 market as I squeeze down the chart there.
NEUT9|I do that just to bring in more perspective, but going through the history of the sharp you can see 127 support, support, support, support and then once again right here didn't quite hit it exactly, but very close.
NEUT10|Will it act as support?
NEUT11|That is the massive?
NEUT12|Going forward and this is not some sort of great.
NEUT13|You know, discovering my part, I assure you people that you start to understand charts have taken notice of that level and I make that comment because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy caught whatever you want, it can definitely produce a whole lot of dynamic movement so.
NEUT14|127 is certainly going to be the main level, and then when you factor in.
NEUT15|This red line right here.
NEUT16|You have a big picture descending triangle pattern here, which is a bearish pattern.
BEAR17|Now that doesn't mean that for sure guaranteed the price is going to keep going down because it's a bearish pattern.
NEUT18|My point here is it's a more than valid.
NEUT19|It's a more than rational thought to have for those people out there thinking you know, I think 127 is about to fail.
NEUT20|You know, not guaranteed to happen, but certainly more than irrational.
NEUT21|And if 127 does fail for the next level of support to keep a close eye on with any sort of failure of that would then be down there right around 1:25.
NEUT22|But as of right now going into next week.
NEUT23|You know the best way to summarize all this is just, you know, the 30 minute time frame descending triangle pattern when in a part of that is that 127, so we'll see if the price can hold above there or not.
NEUT24|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT26|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including.
BULL27|How I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT28|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT29|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR30|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT33|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT35|That is again totally live.
