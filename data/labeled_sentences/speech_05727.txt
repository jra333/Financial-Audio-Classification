NEUT0|"""Rectangles."
NEUT1|A rectangle is a pattern formed when a price is bounded by parallel support and resistance levels.
NEUT2|A rectangle exhibits a period of consolidation or indecision between buyers and sellers as they take turns throwing punches, but neither has taken over.
BULL3|The price will test the support and resistance levels several times before eventually breaking out from there.
NEUT4|The price could trend in the direction of the breakout, whether it is to the upside or the downside.
NEUT5|In the example above, we can clearly see that the pair was bounded by two key price levels which are parallel to one another.
NEUT6|We just have to wait until one of these levels breaks and go along for the ride.
NEUT7|Remember, when you spot a rectangle, think outside of the box.
NEUT8|Bearish rectangle, a bearish rectangle is formed when the price consolidates for awhile during a downtrend.
NEUT9|This happens because sellers probably need to pause and catch their breath before taking the pair any lower.
BEAR10|In this example, price broke the bottom of the rectangle and continued to shoot down.
NEUT11|If we had a short order just below the support level.
BULL12|We would've made a nice profit on this trade.
NEUT13|Here's a tip.
NEUT14|Once the pair falls below the support, it tends to make a move that is about the size of the pattern.
BULL15|In the example above, the pair moved beyond the target, so there would have been a chance to catch some more pips.
NEUT16|Bullish rectangle here's another example of a rectangle, a bullish one this time after an uptrend.
NEUT17|The price is paused to consolidate for a bit.
NEUT18|Can you guess where the price is headed next?
NEUT19|If you answered up, then you're right.
NEUT20|Check out that nice upside breakout right there.
NEUT21|Notice how the price moved all the way up after breaking the top of the rectangle.
BULL22|If we had a long order on top of the resistance level, we would have caught some pips on that trade.
NEUT23|Now, just like the bearish rectangle example, once the pair breaks, it will usually make a move that is at least the size of its previous range.
