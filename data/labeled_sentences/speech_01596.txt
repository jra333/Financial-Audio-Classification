NEUT1|Yes, let's start.
BEAR2|The Bitcoin price is struggling after soaring to an all time high of $61,690.00 in February.
BEAR3|The Bitcoin has struggled even to move above the psychological level of $60,000 today.
BEAR4|The currency is trading at $52,740, which is slightly above yesterday's low of $50,455.
BEAR5|The Bitcoin price has struggled at a time when it ought to be doing well.
BEAR6|For one, Fidelity has filed for a Bitcoin ETF with the SEC.
BULL7|If granted, the fund will be a cheaper option for institutional investors to invest in Bitcoin.
BEAR8|Bitcoin therefore likely dropped because of investors who were selling their grayscale Bitcoin trust Holdings in anticipation of the ETF.
BEAR9|Also, the digital currency dropped even after Tesla announced that it would allow customers to buy using the currency.
BULL10|While this was good news, it was already priced in since the company has already committed itself to start accepting the currency in trading.
NEUT11|This is known as buying the rumor and selling the news.
BEAR12|Other reasons why the Bitcoin price fell is the overall strong U.S. dollar and the performance of the US bond yields.
BEAR13|Therefore, any move below this support will open the possibility of the price falling to the third support at $46,000, which is about 12% below the current level.
BEAR14|However, a move above first support at $53,618 will invalidate this trend.
