NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint.
BULL5|Look down here at the volume man, well above average volume on the day.
NEUT6|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
BULL8|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT9|Could say up here above 282.
NEUT10|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 282, that does not mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL11|But yeah, if the price could manage, stay above that level.
BULL12|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is, with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very beneficial because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls run full control.
NEUT19|You must visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what has been represented in yes and above that level right there.
NEUT21|It would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT22|As long as the price is above that purple line, the bull is 100% owned.
NEUT23|The chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|Let me squeeze things down here a little bit.
BULL25|The adding a little bit more perspective here, but as you're seeing here, it has been quite awhile since Facebook has been up this high.
NEUT26|But next key, overarching area of resistance.
NEUT27|Now to keep an eye on.
BULL28|Going to be right up there at the 291 mark and then after 291 just in case it gets more explosive, next key level would be right up here at the 297 mark, so there's definitely some more room from Facebook to build more momentum, but overall very impressive movement today.
BULL29|Let's see if the price can continue to build on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT40|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT42|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
