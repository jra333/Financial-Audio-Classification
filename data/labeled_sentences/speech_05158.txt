NEUT0|"""It's clean this video chart on ticker symbol NFLX Netflix."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from Slayers disclaimer standpoint, I do own Netflix in my retirement portfolio from the long side, so just keep that in mind as they go through the through the analysis.
NEUT5|Well, an absolutely monster Monster Day not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume and huge well above average volume.
NEUT6|So loud eyeball is going to be watching this one headed into Thursday.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support that a lot of people are going to be watching is this area right here at the 537 mark in 537.
NEUT9|One of those areas where you know this is not a special talent that I have.
NEUT10|I'm not trying to imply that this is a great discovery.
NEUT11|Like I said, a lot of people will be watching that level 'cause it's going to be.
NEUT12|A very important area an when you have a lot of people watching the same levels and wondering the same thing.
NEUT13|Called a cellphone prophecy cover you want it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT14|So that's gonna be one of those levels where if the price comes down here, don't get me wrong, no such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT15|That's not what I'm saying.
BEAR16|I'm just saying that it's a more than rational and some more than valid thought to have that if the price goes down in that area and then breaks to the downside, that could create some big downwards pressure.
BEAR17|Now when I say downward pressure, I don't mean and send this thing back down to 500, but from a trading standpoint you know plenty of wiggle room there to potentially, you know, create a.
NEUT18|Opportunity.
NEUT19|To make a trade, and I mean you look at here and this thing is just so overextended that you know it like that.
NEUT20|It would be shocking to see this thing.
BULL21|Maybe get a bit of a pullback here, but again.
NEUT22|With some of these tech stocks, you know maybe this thing is just getting ready to continue to blast forward, but that's when we level that I'll be watching very closely and then as far as areas of resistance, I guess I. I'm not sure why I went back, 'cause here we go back to this area and next key level resistance watch going.
NEUT23|Not necessarily into Thursday, but just in the foreseeable future.
NEUT24|Right up there at the 555 mark and then if this thing just wants to continue to blast forward after 5:55 next level up there right around the 572 mark.
NEUT25|So those would be the next couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT26|But on all crazy day today.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.

NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
