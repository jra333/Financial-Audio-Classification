NEUT0|"""So guys, this is what it's all about when it comes to investing in the stock market."
NEUT1|Here's the thing you want to make sure that you're doing good research on these companies and your research.
NEUT2|It doesn't have to be complicated if you have my Academy, you should know how to research.
NEUT3|OK, if you're not in my Academy, join my Academy.
NEUT4|OK, I'm gonna put a link out here guys so you can join the Academy.
NEUT5|You can check out how I do my research.

NEUT9|OK, what it be like?
NEUT10|Oh I don't know.
NEUT11|I just want to make some money.
NEUT12|Well you need to be very clear and intentional on how much money you want to make in a stock market before you start.
NEUT13|So you can set some target goals for yourself.
NEUT14|Alright, so one of my big my big returns guys.
NEUT15|I made about a little over $47,000 over Facebook.
NEUT16|Had one of my investments and people say well, why did you sell and you could have made so much more money?
NEUT17|Well I had a target profit.
NEUT18|OK, my target profit was when I made $40,000 off their stock.
NEUT19|OK, my target was to get out OK 'cause I had a plan for that money.
NEUT20|Alright so I was very strategic about when I get out of that.
NEUT21|That that particular position would not.
NEUT22|So you gotta know what you're doing, because if not, you get greedy.
NEUT23|And then what happens?
BEAR24|The stock may pull back on it now.
NEUT25|But all that means is that the stock might go to go down.
BEAR26|You lose some of your profits, so you gotta have cloud around what you're trying to do.
NEUT27|What you want to do with that money when you do make that money.
NEUT28|OK, some of the stocks that you hold out here make sure that you keep on holding for a year possible so you can get those tax benefits right?
NEUT29|So you can get to pay capital gains taxes 15%.
NEUT30|Instead of the ordinary income taxes that were hired to be 25 percent 828% alright.
