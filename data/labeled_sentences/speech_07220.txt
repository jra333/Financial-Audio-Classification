NEUT0|"""I do believe that there are there is a room."
NEUT1|The skinny bundle is going to have a lot of other pieces to it.
NEUT2|Disney is going to be one of those.
NEUT3|It's not gonna be a Netflix killer.
NEUT4|It's going to be in conjunction with that.
NEUT5|But I don't believe that the price point is going to work really.
NEUT6|I don't believe the 5:00 to 8:00 and I'm going to work.
NEUT7|It's going to be 10 or it's going to be higher than that.
NEUT8|So I think we're pretty much they have to spend to make sure that we lower the networks.
BEAR9|But Netflix already raised its prices, so I think they have some some flexibility that I saw on that side is it is positive for them, but I I still think we're stuck in the trading range.
NEUT10|I don't think that this is enough to break us out of that 120, and I wouldn't buy it until it does break out of the trading range.
NEUT11|I'm with Steve.
NEUT12|I don't think this.
NEUT13|You need to compete on price with Netflix.
BULL14|They need to compete on an experience with Netflix.
NEUT15|I don't think they're going to beat them necessarily, but I don't know if it matters.
NEUT16|It probably is room for both, but I also agree with Steve that until you see this North of 120 in a meaningful way, you stay away.
NEUT17|So for me, I wait until they report on May 4th.
BULL18|I do think there's possibly if this Disney plus service impresses.
BULL19|I do think the stock could easily pop 15% over the course of a few months thereafter, so there's certainly upside.
NEUT20|I think the valuations incredibly reasonable, but when I try to compare it to Netflix I'm looking at Netflix's content in what I see is, I see addictive shows where people binge watch.
NEUT21|I'm not seeing addictive binge watching kind of shows or content with Disney.
NEUT22|I look at Netflix and I think I think I think it's completely the opposite.
BULL23|I think Netflix has done a nice job of getting into content, but.
NEUT24|The whole Netflix story is that they've got Subs.
BULL25|They've got international growth and clearly Disney needs to get to that.
BULL26|But Disney's content to me is proven and I I would look at the core and say look at 7 bucks a share at 15 times, which I think is cheap for Disney.
NEUT27|It's 100 and 10115 dollars talk alone without any of this.
NEUT28|And this is all additive.
NEUT29|"So to me I don't understand why this isn't an add-on."""
