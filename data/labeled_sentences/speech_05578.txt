NEUT0|"""What is up you guys?"
NEUT1|Peter Carlo here?
NEUT2|Traders helping traders helping you grow your portfolio one trade at a time.
NEUT3|Right now we're going to talk about Blink.
NEUT4|This is a position that I'm in.
BULL5|I actually sold puts for this Friday for $31 and as long as we close this Friday above $31, which I feel extremely confident in.
NEUT6|I'll make about $157 in premiums.
NEUT7|So not too shabby of a trade.
NEUT8|Nothing crazy, not going to change my life or break the bank or anything, but still not a bad trade with extremely low risk.
NEUT9|But I took this trade show yesterday morning, yesterday morning and I want explained by an, so that's what we're going to do in this video.

NEUT12|Let's get started.
BULL13|So obviously Plug has had a really good year.
BEAR14|Most of these small cap growth companies have pulled back significantly to the 61.8% fibbonaci with ironically levels right up with this point of control forming right here, I'll actually talk about this in another video.
NEUT15|I'm going to make a video on volume.
NEUT16|Profiles and how to use them.
NEUT17|Whether it's on this channel or the main channel, make sure you subscribe to the main channel link in the bio.
NEUT18|If you have not already.
BULL19|But however we pulled all the way back to bounce perfectly at this support.
NEUT20|The one thing that you'll notice right now is that we have a very nice channel that has been forming here.
NEUT21|You could call this a descending wedge, but it would be a little hard to say that really we just have a nice channel forming here.
NEUT22|One thing that you will notice, let me draw my churn lines.
BULL23|Boom, we have a nice channel forming here.
NEUT24|And now we're kind of sitting here at the top.
NEUT25|One thing that you will notice.
BULL26|So we triple bottoms here on this $30 support.
NEUT27|So not only like I said, are we at the 61.8 FIB?
BULL28|But $30 is just a very very strong support and was a strong resistance prior.
NEUT29|So now we're starting to push.
BULL30|We have a good divergance good volume coming in here, which is what we want to see.
BULL31|We want to see volume hold steady and or increase which we are seeing that we take a look at black box stocks today.
NEUT32|An yesterday we have had a ton of buying ton of 416 ton of four nines.
NEUT33|You know some 520 ones but.
BULL34|Overall, pretty significant amount of calls coming in at the ask above the ask good blocks averaging up and the stock is up pretty significantly today.
BEAR35|Actually about 3 1/2% after a pretty strong sell off yesterday, but This is why I like to sell puts because even though the stock was down yesterday, I'm still up about 70% on this position because of the decay that case so bad if you don't understand selling puts, we have a video on this channel teaching you how to sell puts.
NEUT36|It's one of the best ways to trade.
BULL37|It's something that I've been doing for a very, very long time over, although Plug looks pretty good looking like we should get this push back up to $40.
NEUT38|However, I wouldn't be surprised if Plug pulled back to 31 first.
BEAR39|That's why I sold puts at 31 because the worst case scenario is I buy like 400 shares of plug down to 31 bucks and then we see a bounce from their overall guys.
