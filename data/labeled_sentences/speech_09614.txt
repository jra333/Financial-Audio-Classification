BULL0|"""DraftKings, with a revenue increase of 98% year on year in Q3, as the resumption of major US sports continues to propel growth joining us this morning for a first on CNBC interview Draft, Kings CEO Jason Robbins."
BULL1|Jason welcome back good to have you again.
BULL2|Thank you happy to be on.
NEUT3|Do you think this is about the fact that sports seasons have been relatively uninterrupted?
NEUT4|Is it about the expansion of legal betting?
NEUT5|Maybe it's just about the execution of the current existing market, or maybe all three.
NEUT6|I think it's a combination of all three.
NEUT7|Certainly you know the sports calendar has been packed this past quarter, and having you know a few hiccups here and there, but none that actually caused games to get cancelled or really severely disrupted was a nice thing to see and helped a lot.
BULL8|And also we have a lot of new states just starting last year starting in NFL season 2019, we had two states that we offered online sports betting and we're up to 10 now, so that's made a big difference.
NEUT9|And then I think also the stay at home nature of Covid and.
BULL10|People may be having some pent up demand around sports, given how sparse the sports calendar was in Q2 really helped fuel a lot of response and demand in Q3, I think.
NEUT11|We're showing a graphic here talking about more than a million monthly uniques each month during the quarter.
BULL12|That's up 64 year on year.
NEUT13|Can you talk about the cost of attracting new uniques?
NEUT14|Well, we're very data driven as a company.
NEUT15|So what we do is we set targets for a team at levels that we believe provide plenty of cushion between the net present value, the LTV of the customer, and the cost for acquiring them.
NEUT16|The ****.
BULL17|And so you know our team has been able to very successfully this year deploy capital deep into marketing channels, and I think a lot of it had to do with some of the things we talked about a moment ago.
NEUT18|There were so many new states that hadn't been exposed to sports betting prior to this NFL season.
NEUT19|And also there was so many people.
NEUT20|There were so many people staying at home that had real pent up demand for sports.
BULL21|So we saw incredible response and really nice efficiencies and returns on our marketing investments this year.
NEUT22|Well, just to put a finer point on that Jason, I'm just wondering how the business is shaping up down the road in terms of the intensity of sales and marketing spending.
BULL23|I'm just looking at in the latest quarter, 203 million in sales and marketing spending up from 60 million in the year ago quarter.
BULL24|So you kind of had $140 million increase in sales and marketing spending on what a $40 million increase in revenue.
NEUT25|So obviously I mean you just flooding the zone in the near term?
NEUT26|Or is this going to be kind of the run rate of the intensity of spend?
NEUT27|Well, I think right now we're in the customer acquisition phase of the industry and a lot of what next year and the years beyond will look like will depend on how many more states, how quickly you know if this year.
NEUT28|As I mentioned, we had two states to start NFL last year.
NEUT29|We have 10 hour in.
NEUT30|That's a lot of new customers that we can go and market and acquire under the sports book product.
BULL31|If we have a similar situation next year where there's a number of new states that we can go and efficiently and profitably acquire new customers and then will do so and.
NEUT32|We're really going to follow the pace of the market, but I think in general right now it's very much the customer acquisition phase of the industry and some point that will cease to be the case.
NEUT33|But we're still in the first inning.
NEUT34|Or maybe spring training of this.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
