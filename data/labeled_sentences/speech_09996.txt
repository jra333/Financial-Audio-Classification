NEUT0|"""Now I know why y'all clicked on this video."
NEUT1|You want know how exactly this one trade turned $10 into $30,000 in the span of two days.
NEUT2|Now this trade has been on top of my mind for the past week 'cause I just couldn't get it out of my mind.
NEUT3|So I have to talk to you about it in order to stop thinking about it.
NEUT4|So how did this trade all happen?
NEUT5|Well, it all starts off with a small company called Kodak Eastman an if you weren't around the 80s or 90s they were a company that made digital imaging products and when the first cameras it was actually founded in 1888 but later declared bankruptcy in 2012.
NEUT6|'cause you know they stopped making good cameras.
NEUT7|Apparently now last week Kodak Eastman was just trading at around $2.60 before President Trump made this announcement.
NEUT8|With this new agreement.
NEUT9|My administration is using the Defense Production Act to provide a $765 million loan.
BULL10|To support the launch of Kodak Pharmaceuticals, it's a great name when you think of it.
NEUT11|Such a great name was one of the great brands in the world.
BULL12|After that announcement, Kodak opened up 370%, closing at around 790 ish on Tuesday.
BULL13|Number for opening up higher on Wednesday, an reaching ultimately $60.00.
NEUT14|Of course not before they were halted several times due to volatility, right?
BEAR15|In total, that $2.60 on Monday all the way to Wednesday's high of $60.00 would have made you around 2300%.
NEUT16|As a lot, but that's not $10 to $30,000 a lot, right?
NEUT17|So let me introduce you to the power of options.
NEUT18|So they specific option looking at here is the August monthly $30 strikes.
NEUT19|Now obviously this option in on Monday was so out of the money that was probably trading for around $0.00 to 1 cent, right?
NEUT20|So if you're enterprising trader bought ten of those on say?
NEUT21|Monday, that would have been $10 because it had been one cent and options trades are 100 times right?
NEUT22|So one cent is $1.10 of those would be $10 and you would have 10 contracts.
NEUT23|Now let's see what happens once the stock reaches $60.00 on Wednesday.
NEUT24|Now look at this once a week, $60.00 your option on the $30 strike would have reached $30 plus.
NEUT25|Beyond their doors.
NEUT26|You know what's $30?
NEUT27|Thirty dollars in options?
NEUT28|Is $3000?
NEUT29|OK, so with ten contracts, you would have made $10 and 2:10 contracts worth $3000, not together.
NEUT30|That's $30,000, right?
NEUT31|And that's how you get $10 to $30,000.
NEUT32|Now, of course, that's not going to happen every day.
NEUT33|I'll be honest, right?
NEUT34|But this is the power of options.
NEUT35|This is the magic of options.
BULL36|Right, and hopefully you've learned something.
BULL37|"I've learned something and hopefully one of us will be able to catch this train that happens again."""
