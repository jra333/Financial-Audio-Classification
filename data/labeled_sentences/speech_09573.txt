NEUT0|"""Disney saying its streaming service featuring animated shows, Star Wars and more will become an even bigger part of its future."
BULL1|Investors are rewarding Disney today.
NEUT2|Kaylie lines has more details.
NEUT3|Kaylie, yeah Bonnie.
BULL4|They're rewarding Disney in a big way.
BULL5|The stock up double digits in today's session far and away the best performer in the S&P 500 and is trading at a record high.
NEUT6|And this is all about streaming.
NEUT7|As you alluded to at an Investor Day yesterday, the company giving expectations for its streaming service Disney Plus that came in far ahead of what anybody could have guessed.
NEUT8|The company says it could have as many as 200.
NEUT9|And 60 million subscribers by 2024, when you add ESPN and ESPN Plus and Hulu other streaming services, the company offers that could be as high as 350,000,000.
BULL10|It's also raising its prices for Disney Plus by a dollar here in the US.
BULL11|But what's remarkable about this Barney is the pace of growth for Disney.
NEUT12|Plus, it launched just 13 months ago and already has 87 million subscribers in just over a year.
BULL13|It has met its five year goal in terms of subscriber growth.
BEAR14|Of course, a large part of this has to do with the pandemic people being stuck at home.
BULL15|On their couches streaming more, they've seen subscribers grow by more than 50 million just since back in March.
BULL16|But of course, it's critical that the streaming business is doing well for Disney because because of the pandemic, a lot of its other businesses aren't.
BEAR17|Theme parks have had to close cruises, canceled movie theaters closed, which weighs on its studio business.
NEUT18|And as a result, streaming is really critical as a top line driver for the company that direct to consumer business, which houses streaming, is now about 30% of the company's revenue released.
BEAR19|It was in the third quarter will come down a little bit.
BULL20|In the fourth quarter, but it is a major top line driver in that the fact that it's doing well is what has investors so excited today and analysts to one over at Jeffrey said that Disney has topped even grant expectations.
NEUT21|Line the CFO saying yesterday that many Disney Plus subscribers are actually people that don't have children, which I thought was hilarious.
NEUT22|But I guess it's those Star Wars and the superhero movies that are on there as well, attracting people that just aren't parents, for example.
NEUT23|That also have other interests.
BEAR24|So it's obviously impactful on Netflix.
NEUT25|Kelly.
NEUT26|How has Netflix been doing since Disney Plus started?
BULL27|Well, we know the string place is hotly competitive, this space, but Netflix so far in terms of share price, actually is held up pretty well.
BULL28|It's up about 70% over the past year.
BEAR29|Disney, for its part up less than 30%.
NEUT30|Of course the weight that the pandemic is hazards.
BEAR31|Other businesses has something to do with that, but I would note that today Netflix is lower on this Disney news.
BEAR32|That's down by about 1% and one analyst over at Needham saying that Netflix between Netflix and Disney Disney is winning.
NEUT33|She says that Disney is the leader in the streaming industry, that Netflix invented Bonnie.
BULL34|"Kelly, thank you."""
