BULL0|"""Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|It's nasty Persia, and in today's video we're going to be going over three investing tips by Warren Buffett.
NEUT2|Before we get started, I want to say I'm not a financial advisor and you should always do your own due diligence and research before taking part in an investment scheme.
NEUT3|Let's get into it.
NEUT4|So this quote by Warren Buffett is very famous and very well known by my read it to you guys.
NEUT5|So it goes like this.
NEUT6|Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.
NEUT7|Now each of these.
NEUT8|Tips like two of them have quotes, including this one and another one has a chart which I will explain later on this video.
NEUT9|I'll be breaking down these tips.
NEUT10|In depth.
NEUT11|So leave your thoughts in the comments below.
NEUT12|I'm on if you want more videos like this.
NEUT13|So the first part will be breaking broken down into beer.
NEUT14|Be fearful when others are greedy, so this means that when people have unrealistic expectations about the market or the stock.
NEUT15|Without just without doing any research and just speculating you need to take a step back.
NEUT16|You need to assess assess the entire situation and be cautious about it.
NEUT17|Don't just jump right in because the crowd is jumping in and don't follow the crowd.
NEUT18|Use your own brains before just blindly speculating and jumping in.
NEUT19|The second part being greedy when others are fearful means that when there's uncertainty in the market, such as a dip in the market.
NEUT20|You have to be greedy when there's blood on the streets.
NEUT21|And when there's uncertainty, you have to jump in and take a risk.
NEUT22|And what that basically means that for example, we saw our dips the other day are red days.
NEUT23|And that time people were saying buy the dip by the dip.
NEUT24|That's how it goes.
NEUT25|That's what it means.
NEUT26|Be greedy when others are fearful.
NEUT27|That's your entry point.
NEUT28|For probably some stocks that you have been looking to buy.
NEUT29|The second quote by Warren Buffett.
NEUT30|Is.
NEUT31|It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.
NEUT32|And the first part is far better to buy a wonderful company and a fair price.
BULL33|Means that you should look for exceptional companies at even better prices than the company.
NEUT34|You should look for all time lows.
NEUT35|All time good company all time good prices.
NEUT36|And rather than buying a OK company.
NEUT37|Like an OK doing company.
NEUT38|At a good price, you need better companies to buy.
NEUT39|The 3rd and final thing from by Warren Buffet is.
NEUT40|By in your circle of competence.
NEUT41|Do what you think you understand.
NEUT42|So this is what you think you know and this is what you know.
NEUT43|If you do not understand something about a company or its financials, do not buy it.
NEUT44|And that's all for today.
