BULL0|"""They're doing a great draw job using the immersive experience to drive merchandise and drive franchise engagement."
NEUT1|What do you think about the stock overall right now?
BEAR2|Well, we have a hold recommendation on the stock, and while the parks business is doing very well, the stock is going to trade off of the outlook for the direct Consumer initiative.
NEUT3|So of the $17 billion of EBIT da that Disney generates, still about 8-8 and a half comes from their legacy media networks.
NEUT4|ESPN, ABC, The Disney Channel which are facing the same secular pressures as the rest of the ecosystem.
NEUT5|And the big move in the stock price was around expectations around their Disney, plus their direct to consumer.
NEUT6|Service that sets awash in November.
NEUT7|So from a stock perspective, we expect the outlook around that and then subscriber growth in 2020 around the Disney Plus to really drive this doc, you have a hold because you are dubious about what they'll be able to do with direct to consumer or because you think the stock is already priced in a positive reaction to that.
NEUT8|Yeah, the stock is already priced in quite a bit on the direct to consumer product, so Disney doesn't.
NEUT9|The company itself doesn't believe the.
NEUT10|The streaming services, Hulu, ESPN, and Disney Plus are going to be a break even until 2024, and if you put some reasonable multiples on the parks and the studios and on their legacy media networks, you know the market is factoring something like 60 to 7 bit $70 billion of value in for the direct consumer side, which could turn out to be the right valuation.
NEUT11|At this point.
NEUT12|You know, Netflix is probably Netflix is market cap is worth 160 billion today, but there's alot baked into the price of Disney right now.
NEUT13|A lot of expectations around.
NEUT14|"Disney Plus, which again even the company, doesn't think it's going to break even, not even possible break even by 2023-2024."""
