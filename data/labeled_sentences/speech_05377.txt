NEUT0|"""Hey traders control the trade here."
NEUT1|Taking a look at Amazon AMZN.
NEUT2|This is one of my favourites for both short and long term positions.
NEUT3|And earnings are tomorrow.
BEAR4|January 29th after the close.
NEUT5|And let's take a look at the chart here.
NEUT6|One could argue that this is a bull flag pattern that's been developing since.
NEUT7|Really before the before the new year.
NEUT8|So the energy should and could be released to the upside.
NEUT9|It's kinda waiting to break out.
BULL10|It's been lagging in so many different ways and I'd be surprised if they don't report record, fourth quarter earnings and not that I'm so focused on fundamentals, but that's going to help create the spark on the chart that we need to get that big up move.
NEUT11|We've been waiting for.
NEUT12|I was expecting this to break out.
NEUT13|Well above 1900 back here and that just didn't happen and we've been consolidating ever since.
BULL14|We're still above the 50.
BEAR15|Moving average that's bullish, got rejected by the 20.
NEUT16|Moving average today, looks just underneath of it.
BEAR17|So there is some overhead resistance, but it's not not significant.
NEUT18|The thing is, with Amazon going earnings.
NEUT19|It's pretty typical to see 100 point move in either direction, so just keep that in mind.
NEUT20|So let's take a look.
NEUT21|Where we might be headed if we go up?
NEUT22|I've had this.
NEUT23|1942 in the chart for awhile that's that's possible.
BEAR24|But there are a lot of gaps up above here.
NEUT25|So I really wouldn't be surprised if we.
NEUT26|Kind of visited up in the 1925 range.
NEUT27|1930 range.
NEUT28|And if it gets on a little break away, then we could be a 2000 before we know it.
BULL29|On the flip side, we might spike up a little bit.
NEUT30|And then immediately spike down.
NEUT31|Or just come on down here to challenge.
NEUT32|Let's say the 100.
NEUT33|Moving average which is 1795 scuse me 7532.
NEUT34|There are some gaps down here, so even if there is positive news, sometimes you'll notice that.
BEAR35|A stock will still flush down.
NEUT36|And fill a gap and then rock it right up.
NEUT37|So that's kind of what I hope happens, 'cause I would probably want to have a. Arresting by down here.
NEUT38|At this gap.
NEUT39|1789 of 2.
NEUT40|1801 and in between that.
NEUT41|You have.
NEUT42|Your 100.
NEUT43|Moving average.
NEUT44|Kind of in between seventeen 9532.
NEUT45|Let's see if we have any other areas that look interesting.
NEUT46|Maybe to get Phil way down here.
NEUT47|And also that was filled 1792.
NEUT48|Nope, that was filled.
BULL49|Yes, this is a good area to play.
NEUT50|Maybe 1800s, that psychological number would not be surprised at all for visitors 18 or 118 with three somewhere like that.
NEUT51|That seems to happen often, so keep those numbers in mind.
NEUT52|You also have the 200.
NEUT53|Moving average at 1833.
NEUT54|58 So somewhere in that area.
NEUT55|It is a visit down there.
NEUT56|"Just have to wait and see how the other market moves."""
