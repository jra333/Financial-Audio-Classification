NEUT0|"""This is taking stock on Bloomberg."
NEUT1|I'm Pimm Fox coming to you from the Canaccord Adams, a global growth conference in a Boston, OK online encounters.
NEUT2|How do you actually turn those into online sales?
NEUT3|Well, let's find out.
NEUT4|Let's bring in Tim Bixby.
NEUT5|He is the president and the CEO of a live person Tim.
BULL6|It's good to have you with us.
BULL7|Thanks for sticking with us.
NEUT8|What is the is the strategy that companies should be thinking about when they think Liveperson?
NEUT9|How do they use that to actually get those online encounters with potential customers to actually be online sales?
NEUT10|Well, what we've developed at live person is exactly what it sounds like, which is a way for companies of any size to really engage people on their website, and the way that works is through a concept called chat which everyone's been familiar with for a long, long time, but we do something much more interesting, which is we capture website visitors behavior, and then we help our customers figure out which ones of those are most likely to buy, and we enable them to engage chat and byproducts and spend more money.
NEUT11|So when you figure out this, sort of.
NEUT12|Pattern on a specific website of a potential customer?
NEUT13|How does that translate into an interaction?
NEUT14|I mean, do they sort of put a higher value?
NEUT15|A sales Rep on that live person call, or what's the?
NEUT16|What's the plan?
NEUT17|Well, it's very much like if you go into a Department store in the real world, the sales people there are filtering you.
NEUT18|Are you a buyer or you a browser?
NEUT19|Or either by mistake?
NEUT20|If you're serious, but it looks like you're not quite sure you were trying to decide between a blue tie or red tie.
NEUT21|They're going to engage you with live person, enables our customers to do online, is exactly that.
NEUT22|Figure out who's a serious buyer who wants to buy but may have an obstacle.
BEAR23|Something is getting in the way.
NEUT24|We don't know what it is the best way to figure out what that obstacle is.
NEUT25|Solve it and get them to buy is to talk to him.
NEUT26|Talk to him online via chat and but it takes education in terms of the sales people, right?
NEUT27|I mean, that means that the company who's using live person has got to put some effort behind the people on the vendor side absolutely so we don't provide people.
NEUT28|The actual customer service reps or sales reps our customers provide those people, but we provide a lot of the training and expertise to help them understand what works best online.
NEUT29|How do you create a great experience from those reps?
NEUT30|That's part of what we provide to our customers.
NEUT31|What about the types of companies that would be most likely to use?
NEUT32|A live person?
NEUT33|Is it just for the retail environment or is it also business to business?
BULL34|Well, what we're seeing is it's really across the board, the strongest for us.
NEUT35|Our financial services, online retail technology.
NEUT36|So all the hardware and software providers.
NEUT37|But there's also a world of small businesses.
NEUT38|8000 small businesses use live person today.
NEUT39|So one thing I think is interesting is more and more people I know go online and have a chat and see will see the live person logo online.
NEUT40|So it's becoming much more prevalent.
BULL41|Alright, I want to thank you very much.
NEUT42|Tim Bixby coming in the president and the CEO of Liveperson giving US CFO.
NEUT43|I think there's my job alright.
NEUT44|CFO Watts.

BULL46|I appreciate it.
BULL47|Thanks very much.
NEUT48|Tim Bixby coming in from live person giving us a look into the world of online potential retail.
