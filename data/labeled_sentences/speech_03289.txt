NEUT0|"""As a young person, what you're trying to do to prepare for your future, you're trying to accumulate enough assets so that when you are unable or unwilling to work in the future, that you can have this cash flow coming back to you."
NEUT1|What you want to do is invest in the US and you want to invest globally as well.
NEUT2|You don't know that the US will be the best place in the world to invest in the future, so spread your bets out 6070% here in the US, maybe 30% international economic power tends to be get military power, which gets you political power kind of selling Scarface, don't I?
NEUT3|Then we get the money you get to follow when you think of investing, you think of the assets that you accumulate, and there's four primary types of assets, bonds, stocks, cash and real estate and real estate.
NEUT4|I referenced the zombie apocalypse again.
NEUT5|If you own a home and you have a few guns and some food to hang out, you can.
NEUT6|You can sort of ride things out.
NEUT7|Many advisors will recommend you hold up to five or 10% of your assets in gold, because gold has been a store of value and a medium of exchange for the last 5000 years.
NEUT8|the US dollars only been around for about 200.
NEUT9|There's ways to buy gold without buying the actual bullion, but if the grid shuts down an if there's no communication, you will not have it on your person.
NEUT10|Many people like to buy gold, coins, bars or something in the physical tangible form and hide it in their house in a safer in the air conditioning ducts or something like that.
NEUT11|Bonds you don't really want to be involved with bonds at your age bonds or something.
NEUT12|Maybe for people approaching retirement they want to buy a bond because it's a contract that you're going to get your money back and get a stream of the interest payments along the way.
NEUT13|The big risk there.
BEAR14|Inflation and interest rates when interest rates go higher, bond prices go down.
BEAR15|When inflation goes up, the value of the money you're getting back from that bond is going down.
NEUT16|You've got to pay your student loans first.
NEUT17|That's kind of like a non-negotiable.
NEUT18|You gotta pay your rent.
NEUT19|You gotta pay for food.
NEUT20|You're young, your social, you go out, but maybe you buy paps blue ribbon.
NEUT21|You don't buy the Jameson shots.
NEUT22|Let somebody who works at Goldman Sachs buy those for you.
BULL23|So right now is probably the best time to refinance student loans because you're not going to see interest rates much lower.
NEUT24|They can't be much lower than they are right now.
NEUT25|One thing to consider is becoming an employee of the public sector.
NEUT26|By that I mean a teacher, a policeman, a fireman, career, military, city, municipal employees, state employees.
NEUT27|These people, after 20 or 25 years of service are given a pension of fixed amount of money that goes up by some amount every year until you're dead.
NEUT28|So you're a millennial, you're earning $40,000 a year before taxes.
NEUT29|I've got some bad news for you.
NEUT30|There are taxes and their higher if you live in places like New York or Boston or San Francisco, where there's a state income tax and sometimes even a city income tax for $40,000 comes down to $28,000, which comes out to about $2333 per month after taxes.
NEUT31|How much should you spend on rent?
NEUT32|A good yardstick passed down through the ages is no more than 30%.
NEUT33|So 30% of that 2333 equals $700.00 a month in rent.
NEUT34|It's not an enviable thing at all to be a millennial, but some things you do have going for you is that you're a big population in big populations have to have somewhere to live the real estate industry kind of drives the economy and what you millennials do have going for you is you're the biggest cohort of population since the baby boom.
NEUT35|You're bigger now than the baby boom.
BULL36|"Strength in numbers could actually help out."""
