BULL1|That's price has rallied from less than $500 million a year ago to more than $16 billion, making it the 19th biggest digital currency in the world.
BEAR2|This price action is mostly because of the rising user base for its Vechain Thor blockchain network companies like BMW, Walmart, LVMH, and Shanghai Gas are all using it.
NEUT3|Also, we cannot rule out the fear of missing out and the low interest rate environment for helping the Vechain price rally.

NEUT15|This bearish of sentiment can be difficult to read.
NEUT16|It can frequently suggest things will soon be turning around, but there's no guarantee that Vechain will catch on and ever be adopted widely by companies for their supply chains.
