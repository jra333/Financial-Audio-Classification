NEUT0|"""But Joe, I'd like to discuss Fed Chair Jay Powell, who today faces one of his most difficult challenges."
BULL1|Defending a Fed policy that's arguably arguably the most aggressive in history amid a dramatically improved economic outlook?
NEUT2|Let's look at what's changed here.
BULL3|Since the Fed last night, we got the $1.9 trillion in relief enacted by Congress signed by the President.
BULL4|It's prompted a surge in growth forecast.
BULL5|Vaccinations have accelerated.
NEUT6|States have started to reopen.
BULL7|Bond yields have soared, and inflation concerns among the leading market worries right now.
BULL8|Meanwhile, the Fed zero rate and aggressive policies on QA.
NEUT9|They haven't changed.
NEUT10|Powell and other Fed officials say.
NEUT11|They're going to keep them in place until the economy regains.
BEAR12|Most of the ten million jobs lossed from the pandemic.
NEUT13|An inflation runs above its 2% goal for a time, so the focus today will be on how much more optimistic the Fed's own forecasts become at how Powell defends no change in policy.
BULL14|the Fed is likely to hike, for example, its growth outlook for this year.
NEUT15|It had forecast GDP around 4% for this year, or CNBC Fed survey around 6% with no rate hikes expected.
NEUT16|This year the focus turns to the median Fed officials forecast work.
NEUT17|The funds rate in 2022, Fed looks for no hikes.
NEUT18|Are CNBC survey nearly two full Heights with a 0.45 funds rate forecast reported that yesterday, thank you, America Michelle Meyer writes Powell and forecast revisions will seem more upbeat.
NEUT19|This will likely be the feds first step in a less accommodative direction.
NEUT20|But Barclays doesn't think so.
NEUT21|They say we expect the Fed to rain in policy rate expectations in March with the median dots.
NEUT22|That is the feds forecast.
BULL23|Still showing no lift off through 2023 despite an upgraded outlook.
NEUT24|No Fed has ever run so aggressive a policy as this one and so no Fed has ever had to engineer an exit from it.
NEUT25|The question is whether Powell can keep yields at Bay for now and avoid a temper tantrum.
NEUT26|Joe, when he moves to tighten?
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
