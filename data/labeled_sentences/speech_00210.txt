BEAR0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see from this day charge the price of Apple has dropped after opening on the market and then bounced back and close nearly flat at the end of the market."
BULL1|So with a very big volume at the ending.
NEUT2|So if we checked the volume at the charge in the daily chart then we can see.
NEUT3|It has formed a small green candle here.
NEUT4|You can see it's very small body.
NEUT5|His flight pattern, so with the smaller volume, it means there's no by no self from the institution actually.
NEUT6|And also we can see.
NEUT7|Here.
NEUT8|The law under the low keep it intact.
NEUT9|That means this double ship bottom still valid.
NEUT10|The Paris side is that we can see the high we made at the.
NEUT11|The 2nd of November.
NEUT12|Which is 103 thirty seven.
BULL13|Is higher than the high we made on.
NEUT14|The 13th of October.
BEAR15|The high is 125 and now we have another lower high.
NEUT16|Making them made.
NEUT17|On the 9th of November, the high is only.
BEAR18|121 so the lower high is not a good sign for the market.
NEUT19|So we can see actually here.
NEUT20|And then we drop a line for the bottom.
NEUT21|The bottom is here, so it's roughly.
NEUT22|What?
NEUT23|From the dispatcher.
NEUT24|So we are trading with this thing very thin, very narrow range with a.
BEAR25|Decreased volume.
NEUT26|You can see the volume here.
BEAR27|It's not big, it's decreased.
NEUT28|So when the price kept.
NEUT29|Study another volume.
BULL30|Decreased is a good sign.
BULL31|I think it's a good sign because the selling pressure has been decreased so it's still healthy for the Apple stock, and it's very likely in the near future.
NEUT32|Apple stock can break through and break out from this triangle pattern.
NEUT33|So in my opinion.
NEUT34|If it decided to break out, we must have a huge volume here.
NEUT35|Let's wait and see what will happen on Monday.
BULL36|"Thank you."""
