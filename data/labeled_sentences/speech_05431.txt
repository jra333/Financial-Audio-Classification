NEUT6|The first reason is because the oil tanker stocks really benefit from the oil crisis we have currently going on due to the worldwide crisis and the effects of supply and demand.
BEAR7|The oil companies literally have ran out of physical space to store their oil.
BEAR8|What that's done to the oil tanker industry is they became floating storages that has really spiked their income and they're getting three times the daily rates that they used to get.
NEUT9|The second reason is I do a very detailed analysis where I get into all of the financials on the companies and DHP ANSI, PMP came out looking strong and just to be clear, DHT is an oil transport company and see PMP is a dry storage shipping company.
