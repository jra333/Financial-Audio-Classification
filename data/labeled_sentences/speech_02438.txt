NEUT0|"""Good afternoon, Ian Cooper here with chasingmarkets.com."
BULL1|I hope this finds you well.
NEUT2|Have another interesting technical setup.
BEAR3|It would appear that Disney may be ready to pivot lower at the moment.
BEAR4|It's challenging overhead resistance just around 112 to 113 a share.
NEUT5|As you can see, it's also at its Upper Bollinger Band.
BEAR6|It's also starting to fail and pivot at its 70 line on RSI.
BEAR7|Mac D is overextended to the upside.
BEAR8|Williams percentage range is also over extended above its twenty line, just beginning to pivot in the other direction.
BEAR9|Now, as you can see, historically each time that Disney challenges its Upper Bollinger Band set it 2 standard deviations above and below its twenty day moving average, it begins to pivot lower, especially if RSI is at or near its 70 line.
BULL10|If Mac D is pushing as high as it is now.
NEUT11|And as Williams percentage range pushes above its twenty line, you can see this dating back to at least March of 2017.
BEAR12|We would like to see Disney pull back and pivot to as low as 106 to 105 near term.
NEUT13|We do not believe that it can push higher from this point.
NEUT14|But it's worth keeping an eye on for a downside opportunity.
NEUT15|Again, this has been chasing markets.com.
BULL16|"Thanks so much."""
