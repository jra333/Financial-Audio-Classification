NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol, FNC, oh."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the crazy day on this one.
NEUT5|I mean Tuesday was already crazy and then today almost the case of deja vu and actually do this.
NEUT6|So that's what the price look.
NEUT7|Or that's what the chart look like on.
BULL8|Tuesday Big move up and then a pretty pretty intense pullback.
NEUT9|And then let's look at today.
NEUT10|Big move up, very intense pull back so this all has to do with.
NEUT11|What is your perspective?
NEUT12|Meaning, if you're a day trader an you bought right there and your plan was to buy in South in 10 minutes.
BULL13|Well, then from that perspective things are not looking very good, but if you care about the big picture of things and even with that big pullback, the price does still have the opportunity to build a higher base.
NEUT14|So that's what makes these charts so tricky is because it really is just a matter of well, what was your viewpoint?
NEUT15|What was your angle going in and you know to illustrate this quickly.
NEUT16|Let's say the price stays above here.
NEUT17|Well, that would be a set of Lowe's and you compare that to that set of Lowe's and then compare it to these sets of Lowe's down there.
NEUT18|And if you envision each of those stair steps, what do you still have emphasis on big picture?
NEUT19|Well from the big picture, you'd still have stair steps progressing in the upward direction, and that's what you want to see.
NEUT20|Assuming again, you care about the big picture point of view.
BEAR21|So does the chart look shaky?
NEUT22|Does the chart look a little confusing right now?
NEUT23|Absolutely 'cause that was such a massive pullback, but again, to be fair, does the chart?
BULL24|Does the price still have the opportunity to build a higher base?
NEUT25|It absolutely does.
NEUT26|And so that's where you know, really, that that 1850 Mark comes into play as a very important level of support.
NEUT27|So let me get that mapped out here.
NEUT28|So we go 1850 for those reasons just discussed.
NEUT29|You know, in terms of whether or not the price is going to still have the chance that progress is going to be the main area of support.
NEUT30|If the price does try to work its way back upwards, that first key area of resistance to watch very closely going to be right up there at the 21 dollars $21 mark.
NEUT31|So overall crazy chart.
NEUT32|Again, a case of deja vu from Tuesday, but it'll be very interesting to see how this one plays out on Thursday.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT35|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT36|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR41|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT44|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT45|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
