NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart ticker symbol FCEL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, the downwards trend on this one continues and certainly some updates here need to be done as we head into Thursday.
NEUT5|First thing to do is let's go ahead and just get rid of that line up there.
NEUT6|Sure that level still pertain.
NEUT7|She's not really relevant right now.
NEUT8|And from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing confusion and clutter colors.
NEUT9|Lines are very long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible moving forward.
NEUT10|But the first key update that needs to be done come about based on a foundation rule in charting.
NEUT11|Which states when levels of support are broken enclosed below.
NEUT12|They tend to act as resistance, so $13.00 is not going to be that initial area of resistance worth the price.
NEUT13|Does try to consolidate out here and then turn itself around.
NEUT14|That's where the big question Mark resides.
NEUT15|Not necessarily in the sense of kinda price.
NEUT16|Get to 13, but more importantly, can the price break above it and stay up above it.
NEUT17|So you're going to want to keep a very close eye on that area here moving forward and we'll see if the price can even, you know, get back through there if it can.
NEUT18|Then at that point it starts to make more sense to talk about and focus on that 50.
NEUT19|Moving average up there.
NEUT20|The Purple Line, but for now you know a little bit.
NEUT21|Probably too premature to be putting really any focus on that level until the price proves itself in the near term.
NEUT22|By getting above 13.
NEUT23|Now, what about levels of support?
BEAR24|Well, for this, we're going to squeeze down the chart here quite a bit, 'cause as you see here, it's been a long time since the price been back down around this area.
BULL25|So near term level of support now is looking like basically right where it closed at 12:50.
BULL26|Yeah and you see right here at 12:50 did a good job of providing support, providing support, providing support.
NEUT27|But given that the price is currently knocking on that door, I'll map out one more area just in case.
NEUT28|That level doesn't quite hold up, so the next main level after 12:50 would then be down there right around $11.85.
NEUT29|So keep running these technical areas moving forward.
BEAR30|But yeah, as of right now very clearly the downtrend continues.
NEUT31|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT32|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT37|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT43|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT44|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
