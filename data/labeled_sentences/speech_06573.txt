BEAR4|Why is very bearish as the pair continues to fall within the downward sloping channel that began from the June 2015 high of 141.04.
BEAR5|The Paris trading below the daily chipokae cloud and also below the 200 day moving average.
BEAR6|The tank uncen and the Kijun Sen lines are negatively aligned and pointing downwards, giving a bearish signal as well.
BEAR7|After breaching the key 130 level prices have scope to fall towards the 126.08 level and this is the low from April 2015.
BEAR8|If we look at Rs sites in bearish territory it's below 50, but it's now approaching oversold levels at 30, which could lead to some consolidation in the near term.
