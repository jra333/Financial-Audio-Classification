BULL0|"""Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, voicing support for a hike in the corporate tax rate he issued this statement on Tuesday, saying quote, we support the Biden ministrations focus on making bold investments in American infrastructure."
BULL1|We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides, both on the specifics of what's included as well as how it gets paid for, were supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate.
NEUT2|Bezos did stop short of endorsing the president's tax hike plan.
NEUT3|Buddha judge was on Ms this morning Jim, and said even if we get to 28, which no one actually believes they're going to get to.
BEAR4|You still talking about the lowest corporate tax rate in at least his lifetime, he argued.
NEUT5|Look, I sometimes you see these comments from from corporate executives and you just say holy cow, are they ever not united at this baseless comment is directly opposite of the all the CEOs that have come on air and yet who's the most successful then?
NEUT6|I think if we basis David, it's it's really dawning on people.
NEUT7|The most successful banker is saying that there's too much greed that may be the most successful user of the Internet.
NEUT8|You say no.
NEUT9|I mean we will pay more David what's going on here?
NEUT10|Dogs and cats, dogs and cats living together?
NEUT11|I don't know.
NEUT12|I mean, I know Diamond saying don't get rid of the inability to deduct salt.
NEUT13|OK, and this guy.
NEUT14|Now the company that is criticized for trying to avoid taxes wherever it can, is saying, yeah, OK, we're OK with it I it's it's news, which is why we're talking about an he is.
NEUT15|Mr Business is nothing.
NEUT16|If not, perhaps the most important CEO in the country, I would argue.
NEUT17|Certainly Amazon, as a part of so many people's lives, is and as a focus on both sides, politically, at least under pressure in some way from the Bernie Sanders camp some time ago.
NEUT18|But remember, has at least a $15.00 an hour wage at the same time.
NEUT19|There's still the question of unionization in Alabama, for example, where the president has sided with the potential for unionizing there, so it's interesting to say the least, that he would come out in that fashion.
NEUT20|Of course we'll see, yeah, but will not be for that much longer.
NEUT21|Jim taking on the chairman role.
BULL22|Perhaps we'll start to see Bezos participate a little bit more fully in dialogue like this.
NEUT23|Well, for instance, we have.
NEUT24|Darren was coming up the CEO of Exxon and David.
NEUT25|If you ask him, higher taxes, what he's going to say?
NEUT26|No.
NEUT27|I would assume he would say no, right?
BULL28|He'd say that we need to have enough money to be able to pay the shareholders dividend coral.
NEUT29|I think that these executives who are saying things that are contrary to what they expect to be will actually take a lot of heat because there are a lot of people who basically just say are you kidding me?
NEUT30|I mean, you make so much money and now you sure you're willing to let your company do this, and you're so rich and you can say that, but you know what do I do?
NEUT31|I'm in a company that if they do this, I'm not going to get a raise, so.
NEUT32|Somehow what's viewed as being selfless will come off as selfish if the executives make a lot of money.
NEUT33|Yeah, we are expecting to hear the President later today.
NEUT34|Guys.
NEUT35|He's going to talk about really what the definition of infrastructure is.
NEUT36|They've been trying to broaden that definition versus public.
NEUT37|Perhaps perception.
NEUT38|Jim Hill.
NEUT39|Say why is it acceptable that 91 of the biggest corporations paid 0 in federal taxes in 2019?
BEAR40|There's also a growing discussion about which sectors are going to get hurt the most.
BEAR41|Fang, for example, has the lowest median effective tax rate.
BEAR42|And there's some who argue that's going to feed the rotation we've been talking about for several months.
BEAR43|Well, it would be amazingly, as long as we get new money into the S&P, which is what I think is happening instead of individual stocks have been such a failure in the last three months.
NEUT44|That that goes right in favor of the largest companies in the in the SMP, which are the ones that you just mentioned.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
