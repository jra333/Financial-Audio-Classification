NEUT0|"""Welcome back is 8 of June 2020."
NEUT1|Monday, the first day of the week, so we have just done between coming in about 1 Ethereum SRP Bitcoin Cash because we like when Cardano, EOS, Binance coin not going to want to tell us coming in at #11 with vertical XD so let's get straight over Texas technical analysis so far except against BTC we are.
NEUT2|Ian yeah we're we're really hoping.
NEUT3|This is some sort of a. ABCD squeeze Abes thinks he's not done yet and then you get a D&E.
NEUT4|And by September Poo we blast off.
NEUT5|Yeah, that would be the best case, you know.
NEUT6|We're hoping for that to happen whether we get it or not.
NEUT7|Another story on its own.
NEUT8|I feels to me like we see is not done testing a lot of our selling.
NEUT9|Look at the cell volume here.
NEUT10|Humongous absolutely absolutely humongous cell volume for test CSV.
BULL11|So which means that we should be coming back down for an accumulation.
NEUT12|Accumulation.
NEUT13|As in we do nothing but go sideways, right?
NEUT14|Down accumulation and I don't need, we go back up so it's not going to be as clear cut, but very likely is going to be accumulation up and down, up and down and we go back up for a D in an E and palm.
NEUT15|We blast off.
NEUT16|So at this time I don't think is wise move to make entries.
NEUT17|We have to be patient.
NEUT18|We have to wait for the tests.
NEUT19|We also do their thing and then once we are clear that only do we make a move until we are clear we don't make a move we will wait very patiently.
NEUT20|For the task rules to do the acting alright, so let's move on to test against USD.
NEUT21|But before that please give this video a like you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about this in the comments below.
BEAR22|For tensors against USD, there is a marginally higher high and on the smaller timeframes you're going to see that this is a double bearish divergance higher high on the price, but a lower high under make Deanna lower high under RSO, you really see it here.
NEUT23|To be honest, you can really see it here.
BEAR24|This is a lower high on the main DA, lower high under RSI.
NEUT25|So which means that this is already 8.
NEUT26|Double bearish divergance Yeah it's not a schedule, but it is still a valid double bearish divergent, which means that we should be reversing back down fairly soon.
NEUT27|We might still go back up for a triple bearish divergance first before going back down, but at the same time we're not going to be rushing into anything.
NEUT28|We're just going to be waiting patiently for that as well as to do their thing.
NEUT29|And once we see a proper reversal chart pattern of thoughts, you know this already be the left shoulder you could go out for hit and then we get a right shoulder, and then we might take the.
NEUT30|Ride Twister downside, but you will see proper bearish chart patterns.
NEUT31|We're not going to be rushing into any trace we will be patient and we would like to invite you to stay patient with us.
NEUT32|Alright, so I guess I see from my intestinal analysis.
BULL33|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL34|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT35|"I'll see you in the next video."""
