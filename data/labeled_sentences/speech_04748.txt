BEAR0|"""So everybody globelyst Mark Zuckerberg, who does not own his platform at all."
NEUT1|The government does, or whoever the deep state has decided to sell 6 billion of his company.
NEUT2|Now my opinion and I said this before is he's getting ready to bail because he's going to have consequences for what he did and The thing is that they still want to run that website as a globalist agenda.
NEUT3|And you cannot do it.
NEUT4|And Winnie has consequences.
NEUT5|And when their massive an when there's criminal charges when we get our attorney generals all In Sync and offed off from the left, they will be able to prosecute all these people that are committing crimes on the Internet and so just sit tight while they bail.
NEUT6|They'll probably be new faces that will also inherit the liabilities and they will also try a new agenda, but when they get in there and see that there's going to be consequences, then they're going to bail.
NEUT7|So we're just going to have to sit tight while there's things change hands, but everybody wake up.
NEUT8|You cannot do what these globalist sites are doing from Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, any of them.
NEUT9|They cannot operate and discriminate based on political views.
NEUT10|It's against the law and it's a federal crime.
BULL11|"Thank you."""
