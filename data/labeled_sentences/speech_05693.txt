BULL0|"""Absolutely, we've seen some very credible forecasts."
BULL1|Is expecting the RBA to cut rates and I think in fairness you could make a very credible argument to cut rates in a very credible argument.
NEUT2|Not too was very finely balanced.
NEUT3|I find it quite interesting in that key last paragraph in the statement that the RBA hasn't doesn't appear to have even sort of strengthened its easing bias.
NEUT4|Very focused on the labor market and not so much on inflation.
NEUT5|Yeah that is interesting becauses we were expecting potentially if the Reserve Bank didn't cut today that we would have some explicit easing bias and it doesn't appear as though there is any of that in this statement.
NEUT6|That's attached with attached to the decision.
BEAR7|Look, I think that's exactly right, and there's been a few forecasters that had thought the RBA may not cut today because of the election cycle, but may move in June or July, and that seems very unlikely.
NEUT8|Now when you look at the focus from that statement.
NEUT9|So when I read that and I have a quick glance at it, it's all about labor market data from here on in, and the labor market has been holding up very well, but really keeping that unemployment rate around 5% will be absolutely critical.
NEUT10|Joe, can I also ask you to what extent did the upcoming federal election play a role here?
NEUT11|Do you think the RBA would prefer to stay on the sidelines until they get some clarity on the fiscal policy side of things and maybe even lay out a case for easing into the future when we get the statement of monetary policy on Friday?
NEUT12|Yes, so look from my perspective.
NEUT13|The election doesn't change the obvious action.
NEUT14|You know.
BEAR15|I think if the RBA really felt the economy needed a boost from lower interest rates, they would have cut rates.
NEUT16|And obviously we've got precedent of central banks moving in both directions in election cycles before.
NEUT17|So for me, that's less relevant.
NEUT18|I wouldn't expect the statement on monetary policy to deliver any different message from what we've seen in the statement today.
NEUT19|Obviously it will have all the forecasts and the details, but as you said in this last paragraph in today's statement, we haven't seen any.
NEUT20|Strengthening of an easing bias, so I wouldn't expect that monetary policy to show that.
NEUT21|So from my perspective, we know the RBA prefers to move rates when at meetings that are associated with a statement on monetary policy.
NEUT22|So August is sort of next.
NEUT23|The next moving point, I think.
