BULL0|"""Hey traders, investors surge burger."
BULL1|We've had some great freaking trade in Facebook so far this year and I think another one setting up here right now.
NEUT2|So let's have a look at Facebook.
NEUT3|First of all, a little bit of perspective you can see.
NEUT4|Since 2012, since the IPO there was that I guess it was May 2012.
NEUT5|We continue to trade more or less within the this range, or at least the uptrending channel I should say.
NEUT6|But you can see once again at the upper end of that range.
BEAR7|Now again doesn't mean we can't push higher through a multi month lens, but I think through the multi week near term lens we are quite overbought here and as you guys know I'm all but the rate of change.
BEAR8|And that this to me, seems to be fairly unsustainable in the near term.
NEUT9|Let's or have a look at what this what this looks like on the near term chart you can see for one Facebook quite overextended above its 200 day moving average at the at the moment.
BULL10|That's this red line we consider hold that line, and that's good.
NEUT11|And you know, again, until you know that ever breaks it.
NEUT12|If it ever does, this stock is continued to be a buy on the dip.
NEUT13|However, what's more concerning here is the near term and you can see.
BULL14|For example, we had a great trait.
NEUT15|The short side for clubhouse members.
NEUT16|Here in in February when we had a strong and very visually obvious bearish reversal, we don't have that quite yet here.
NEUT17|But what we do have is basically an unsustainable rate of change.
NEUT18|Move off those.
BEAR19|Off those lows in early February and that really is my concern here.
NEUT20|If you look at this a little bit more closely, 821 day moving averages we actually as I'm recording this or just barely piercing below the eight day moving average.
NEUT21|That's his blue line.
BEAR22|That would be the first time we're closing below there since early March or against the second week of March.
NEUT23|So I'm watching that pretty closely so also what I want to show you guys is basically, if you were to go to the options table, which is there's a lot to be read on the options table, so I'm gonna quickly show you guys this so basically.
NEUT24|Well, it's kind of interesting here is that and I talk about this.
NEUT25|A lot of my courses teaching people how to actually appropriately use use use options, which you can see here.
NEUT26|This is Facebook right in the bottom you have implied volatility.
BULL27|Now it's interesting the stock of course has been moving higher, but so too as implied volatility since the whatever.
NEUT28|Let's call that the second week of March, right?
BULL29|So even though the stock has been trending higher since, all although it's been Tapi.
NEUT30|We've seen implied volatility structure slowly curl higher, and that tends to be or can be a somewhat of a leading indicator sign, so I wanted to just kind of share that with you guys of what's going on.
NEUT31|So to me there's a couple of potential trade setting up here.
NEUT32|Again, I'm not expecting this talk to completely fall apart, but I would I would.
NEUT33|I would suspect that I moved back into that 200 and five 105 areas.
NEUT34|105 area is probably not too far out.
BEAR35|Again, it's a stock that's been struggling over the past few days.
NEUT36|Implied volatility.
NEUT37|Slowly going up so there's a couple of traits one can do here.
NEUT38|Well, can either start selling out of the money call spreads, which are still quite attractive.
NEUT39|Or you can buy some cheap put spreads.
NEUT40|And.
NEUT41|And see the stock and push a little bit lower.
NEUT42|Of course, the more breathing you'll be giving yourself if you.
NEUT43|Sell some out of the money, call spreads and so that's kind of what I'm looking at here.
NEUT44|Facebook guys, I hope this makes sense.
NEUT45|Any questions?
