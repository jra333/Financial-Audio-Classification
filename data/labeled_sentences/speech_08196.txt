NEUT0|"""Welcome back to my channel."
BEAR1|I know everyone has been frustrating that those Koi hasn't breakout of consolidation and staged another bull run up to $0.15.
NEUT2|Yet I truly believe it's just a matter of time before that happened, and I've been accumulating more coins whenever the price drop below 5.7 cents.
NEUT3|And I think if you looking at those coin as a long term play right now is the best time to accumulate because the last thing you want to do is wait for another run up.
NEUT4|In price and then go and get in at a higher price.
NEUT5|As you can see these are all my buys.
NEUT6|Whenever the price drop below 5.7 cents.
NEUT7|Because I really believe that very soon, once those coy break out of consolidation and run, I won't buy it.
NEUT8|At this price again and for me, I'm looking at those guys as a long term play so it doesn't really bother me if the price dip a little bit, but I'm pretty sure it's going to stage another run very very soon.
NEUT9|Anyway.
NEUT10|Don't forget that those core is very, very volatile, so only invest with whatever you can afford to lose.
NEUT11|Now let's take a quick look at the chart and see if we can figure out which direction the price will move.
NEUT12|This is the one week chart for those Hawaii.
NEUT13|As you can see, those coin has been.
BEAR14|Trading at this very, very tight range and earlier today the price actually broke out of this state trading range.
NEUT15|It went to about 6 pending, but then the seller just puts it right back again and right now it is again inside this tight trading range.
NEUT16|So really, I mean when you look at his chart here, it is just waiting to break out.
NEUT17|We don't know when but.
BULL18|Once it doing the momentum, it's just going to break out, so for me I am still very bullish and I will continue to accumulate more coins at the price that is right now, which I think is a great entry point.
NEUT19|It's just a lot of time before this thing will run up, so let's just be patient and wait for it.
NEUT20|And that's it for this video.
