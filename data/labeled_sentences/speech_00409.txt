BEAR0|"""US exporters are crying foul as the price of shipping containers spikes are Brian Sullivan's in Charleston, SC this morning with an explainer on this latest trade dispute, Brian."
NEUT1|Hey Carl, yeah I'm going to try to explain it.
NEUT2|I mean you guys like to talk about global macro.
NEUT3|This is the most global macro of all the stories that involves these things behind us.
NEUT4|You don't even think about him, but guess what?
NEUT5|When you can't buy stuff at the stores, retailers can't get stuff on their shelves and peloton can't get new bikes.
NEUT6|That's when you start to think about it.
NEUT7|Alright, in a basic, very basic way, here's what's going on in a normal year.
NEUT8|It would cost.
NEUT9|I don't know 1500 to 2500 to rent one of these things to ship goods from China to Long Beach or Charleston, SC.
NEUT10|That's a normal year.
NEUT11|Then the container goes inside, America picks up soybeans or bourbon or whatever it is, goes back to the ports, and then is exported to China or other parts of the world.
NEUT12|That's how it normally goes.
NEUT13|Here's what's happening now.
NEUT14|Demand from China is so hot we are buying so much stuff from China that the container cost guys are now 4-5 or even $6000 and it's so profitable for the shipping companies that they'd rather send the containers back to China.
NEUT15|Empty to basically get back in line like that taxi driver at LaGuardia, then to put that container on the interior of the United States.
NEUT16|Which means guys that if you want to ship stuff around the world, you're going to either have trouble getting a container or you're going to have to pay a lot more and it's got exporters crying foul to the point where they are asking the government for help because they want to sell soybeans and bicycles and whatever around the world and they can't get one of these things an meantime.
BEAR17|The shipping companies are just.
NEUT18|Printing money, it's one of these things that we never thought about until we do.
NEUT19|And by the way, almost everything coming into port skies is tariffed.
BEAR20|But China has never sold us more goods at any time in history and it's really disrupting this.
BULL21|Yeah, trade deficit goal will point to that.
NEUT22|It's absolutely fascinating, Brian.
NEUT23|I guess actionable?
NEUT24|Who are the winners and losers?
NEUT25|Beyond the obvious mariscus Anan manufacturers that don't export at all, I guess.
NEUT26|Yeah, well, that's so you.
NEUT27|You named it the biggest one.
NEUT28|Merce Kenhub, pag Lloyd.
NEUT29|And sometimes they trade overseas markets.
NEUT30|Jim probably knows about some of these companies.
NEUT31|I did not textainer Caig, Triton International American companies TGH TRT en CA I those are the tickers.
BULL32|Look at their stock charts by the way, they have soared.
NEUT33|You've also got some other plays.
NEUT34|I would say an Atlas Air worldwide aaww guys and again not recommending him saying they're winning because a.
BULL35|Shipping rates are up.
BEAR36|Container leasing costs are up in the air.
NEUT37|Carrier is like an Atlas are printing money because if you need something that's high value you're going to charter a plane rather than wait months for some of these containers.
NEUT38|So those are some of the winners.
NEUT39|Jeffries likes names like a danaos's international.
NEUT40|There's a few like that guys names we normally don't talk about.
NEUT41|Peloton wants to fix this because they want to sell you more bikes.
NEUT42|Here's the greatest anecdote of all.
NEUT43|They've still got Christmas decorations coming into port.
BEAR44|The the lags are so great.
NEUT45|Yesterday, a shipment of ornaments.
NEUT46|I'm not kidding.
NEUT47|A shipment of Christmas ornaments that was supposed to be here in November just rolled in.
NEUT48|That's the kind of backlog we're talking.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
