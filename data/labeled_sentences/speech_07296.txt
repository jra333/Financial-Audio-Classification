NEUT1|Hello Investors, welcome to your own channel Minnesota.
NEUT2|I am Guru Curry and today we're going to discuss about the types of stock analysis.
NEUT3|There are only two types which are fundamental analysis and technical analysis.
NEUT4|We will see their differences and when should we use them so without further delay let's get started.
NEUT5|In the fundamental analysis, we study all the basic information of a company, its fundamentals, like it's we ratio the balance sheet of the company, the promoters of the company, fundamental analysis is used for long term investment like 10 years, 15 years and much more.
NEUT6|And while studying for technical analysis, we study only about the charts.
NEUT7|The various chart patterns, the various indicators are used to predict the future price of shares.
NEUT8|Technical analysis is useful for intraday as well as short term trading.
NEUT9|In this Battle of Stock market, fundamental analysis and technical analysis will serve you as M 416 and a WM, and every investor should learn both of them and we are going to upload free lecture series on both of these two.
