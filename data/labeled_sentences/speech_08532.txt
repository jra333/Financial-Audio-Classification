NEUT0|"""That our eggs we start with one of our chart."
NEUT1|OK, first of all, if you refer to analyze this in my last video in the price was exactly here.
NEUT2|We mentioned if you want to look for BI better, we get one more drop because we give the different reason as we can see the price drop then reverse OK an we didn't have the update on that But for this move there was a few portunity we could look for by there was every correction we could look at that rate but the way it was moving really I'm the corrective but we had the opportunity to look for.
NEUT3|I I know wanna see what's the next now we need to look at this because we want to see whether there it can break the previous stop or not.
NEUT4|By the way, we start with the higher time frame.
NEUT5|We start with the charge whatever we can see based on daily chart and we see the price broke the previous stop.
NEUT6|But now the question is whether we can get the break out of this or not.
NEUT7|That's why we need to be.
NEUT8|See how we can look for trade and even if we move to forward chart.
NEUT9|Based on forward chart, we have been within this long term correction and.
NEUT10|As we can see again.
NEUT11|If you point price broke the previous stop an now we want to see how we can need.
NEUT12|We need to look for this.
NEUT13|We need to see whether there is a continuation for the breakout or not and if even if you want to look for trade, we need to get the proper correction.
NEUT14|Because if you get a bigger correction, the next move can be.
BULL15|It can give us more.
NEUT16|I mean, that can be sharp, move to break this stuff, but if the prices move as a corrective here we need to be quite careful.
NEUT17|That's why anyone got the trade within this move.
BULL18|At least books on profit alright?
NEUT19|Or move their subclass to break even, but rather than that we have nothing is else we we can discuss based on forward chart as I mentioned.
NEUT20|If we want to look for the next trade we need to get the proper tray set up.
NEUT21|We need to get the confirmation and even if you move to one over chart.
NEUT22|Similar to what I explained based on forward chart.
NEUT23|I don't think I mean, even if the price continue from here, I don't think we can get a really good trade setup even.
NEUT24|If there is a continuation, I don't think we can look for the flag to look for by because it's quite risky.
NEUT25|But even if we get the short move, like if you want to look for by, we can trade it with, but we consider the short term trade.
NEUT26|The best thing is if we get a big correction here.
NEUT27|If we get there.
BULL28|Proper correction flood, then the next move can give us better confirmation that the price can break the previous stop.
NEUT29|By the way, right now we cannot look for trade.
NEUT30|We need to be aware made the price.
NEUT31|Then moved for big correction and the next correction how deep it can be.
NEUT32|We cannot confirm.
NEUT33|OK anyway, and the only times if we get any sharp movie The flag.
NEUT34|This is where it all the traits we have here we need to.
NEUT35|Problem, I mean manage it or take out the profit in case there is a reverse or mostly we're looking for the correction for continuation or reversal.
NEUT36|As I mentioned, we don't have any trade setup in this case, we just follow the chart.
NEUT37|"If I see any update I will share, thanks."""
