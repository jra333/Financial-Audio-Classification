NEUT4|This is in Netflix on the 15 minute pull back.
NEUT5|OK this plays to the short side and alongside.
NEUT6|So what do we see?
NEUT7|A bear 15 minute candle under the cloud that will give us our candidate.
BEAR8|Then we see a pullback.
NEUT9|2D opens.
NEUT10|You want to pull back to the open that gives us.
NEUT11|Our possibility then we're going to look short that candle, so we short it right there at four 3416, and we keep selling pressure all the way there.
NEUT12|Three ways to trade this number.
NEUT13|One short stock by market close would made about $7.00 to 100.
NEUT14|Seven 100 bucks number two you have sold the in the money call spread, so you're going to the four four 3440 call spread so you sell for 30 or 40 calls.
NEUT15|Fred, you do that for 5 bucks.
NEUT16|Well, right now it's worth 0.
NEUT17|And the third way to trade it is you could by next week 425 puts.
NEUT18|Those are puts for next week.
