NEUT0|"""In Paul Sankey from Sankey Research, Paul, great to see you is, as always, I guess the first question is outlook for oil prices next year."
BULL1|And then maybe we can move on to some of the stocks is there's hope for a cyclical recovery, but we've already seen quite a lot of that in oil prices.
NEUT2|I don't think so, and I'll come back to that in a second.
NEUT3|I've been very interested by what you've already said, and on the show this afternoon in terms of inflation, which we have to think about.
NEUT4|And of course we all out in about the dollar.
NEUT5|But first, just to wish you a very happy New Year in writing to a virtual party tonight on Twitter, which we have through the E FT community.
NEUT6|That's Twitter virtual party, Kenny Legs, roll, core and you're all welcome viewers.
NEUT7|And of course he will.
NEUT8|France therapies.
NEUT9|So the outlook I think at this time the biggest arbitrage I see is.
NEUT10|Is really related to the dollar in terms of people being very bearish and perhaps not being as bullish on oil.
BEAR11|And of course you can express a bullish view on oil through this doc, so I don't think the stocks are at a really discounting the potential for much higher inflation or a much weaker dollar which would tend to go together.
BULL12|Additionally, I think will fit over the course of the past year.
NEUT13|We had a real situation of what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger and of course what we're seeing here is not only finally the bankruptcy of Chesapeake, for instance, and.
NEUT14|Consolidation in the sector which you guys have been following but also even up to activism with an X on so it is a number of factors here that make us actually pretty optimistic, about 21 and very optimistic.
NEUT15|About the 22 onwards timeframe once demand is back in 21.
NEUT16|Assuming we do get jet fuel demand back, which is the King.
NEUT17|So where do you want to be positioned to in the majors which which clearly have very little risk of going bust going forward, or or some of the smaller, more high beta geared names?
BULL18|If they've as you said, got through this tough year and perhaps come out the other side, little stronger.
NEUT19|Well, I'm running a refining conference on Monday and that that in itself is is this good area to start.
NEUT20|We've got renewable diesel as a theme for some other refiners, so we like the big refiners here.
BULL21|Assuming again, that jet fuel demand comes back, which is dependent on our recovery.
NEUT22|Obviously from Covid there's a choice, really.
NEUT23|Wilfred between investment and speculation.
NEUT24|So obviously the higher risk names would be obviously more speculative.
NEUT25|Higher risk reward, you know names.
NEUT26|For example, if you want to go wild by oxy warrants or something that's really very high risk.
NEUT27|You know highly indebted companies, but again, if we gotta move in the dollar from say, 90 on the dxy to 70 on the dxy, I think you'll see $70.00 oil.
NEUT28|At that point, you really want to be in some high risk names over V Eventive is another one with a lot of debt.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
