NEUT0|"""We got it essentially from the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States, who said we have troubled assets in the banks, which meant that we've got a lot of paper that is not performing and that we have to do is take these troubled assets outside from the banks or settle it so that you recuperate confidence."
NEUT1|And we've forgotten what he said.
BEAR2|And we have still not been able to identify these troubled assets.
NEUT3|Price them.
NEUT4|And to locate them.
NEUT5|And I know that the Obama government is trying to do that right now.
NEUT6|And depending on how successful they are, I think we will settle the initial cause of the recession.
NEUT7|Now that talks of revival happening.
NEUT8|Do you think we should be more cautious now or should we be should be relaxing?
BULL9|Look forward to better times.
NEUT10|I don't think that until.
NEUT11|The reason for the weakness of the big banks?
NEUT12|In the West, which is that you don't know which one is solvent or insolvent?
NEUT13|Who owns what until that issue is resolved?
BEAR14|I don't think the recession will go away because the recession.
BEAR15|Is caused by the fact that people are not investing.
NEUT16|People are not borrowing and people are not employing until that changes.
NEUT17|I don't see how it's going to go away.
NEUT18|How do you think India has called with it and how do you say India performing over the next few years?
BULL19|Well I think India has behaved well in the sense that it's got good monetary policy.
BULL20|It's good good macroeconomic policy.
NEUT21|Your banks are solid and you haven't gone and used funny paper.
NEUT22|That's fine.
BEAR23|The trouble about India is that no matter how much it's grown, we're so globally interconnected.
BEAR24|"That what happens in the West is going to affect us all."""
