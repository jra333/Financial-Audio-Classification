BULL11|So we are in Dubai and Dubai is one of the smartest city in the world thanks to our visionary leaders for making our life so easy.
NEUT12|Before we proceed with the steps, I would like to give you a friendly advice.
NEUT13|Please do not come with 100% of your capital test the waters with 30 to 40% of your capital amount and then once you are confident you can gradually increase the amount.
NEUT14|The 1st and Basic step is to get an investor card to get an Avista card you have to go to Dubai Financial market that is located in Dubai World Trade Center.
NEUT15|If you are you a resident, please carry your original passport and origonal images ID.
NEUT16|If you are a foreigner would like to invest in Dubai Financial market please comment below or send me an email.
NEUT17|I will respond you accordingly.
NEUT18|Once you have received this ivesta card, this card will store all the information related to your stocks, your dividends, your portfolio, etc, etc.
NEUT19|You can track it online, which I'll be mentioning it in my next steps.
NEUT20|Step #2, once you have received the Oyster card, you have to register the Avista card on the website.
NEUT21|The website link is mentioned in the description box.
NEUT22|Once you're registered you can track your portfolio, your investment, you're trading stocks etc etc.
NEUT23|Everything under one group.
NEUT24|Also on this website you can watch live market data that is during the trading sessions from 10:00 AM to 2:00 PM.
NEUT25|If you have completed step number one and #2 successfully, now it's time to get it broken.
NEUT26|There are many brokers in the market providing state of the art facilities.
NEUT27|Also, the Commission structure remains almost the same between the brokers.
NEUT28|Let me give you an example.
NEUT29|Now if you are trading with 25,000 items, your Commission will be minimum 75 grams plus 5% Vt and tendons to the market plus 5% vieti.
NEUT30|If you are trading anyway about 25,000 items, your Commission will be 0.275% + 5% vieti and tendons to the market plus 5% vieti.
NEUT31|I hope this was simple and easy to understand.
