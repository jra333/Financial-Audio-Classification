NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, this is Mata door and this is a trade I took in agile and some time ago and this is kind of interesting."
BEAR1|The stock was in a fairly nice established downtrend and see all the moving averages are getting in line and falling even the 200 MA are starting to roll over here.
BULL2|Not a series of lower highs through here.
BEAR3|Lower lows as well but then this stock actually traced a double bottom here.
BEAR4|Almost a high to slightly higher swing low here.
BULL5|So I was watching this and it actually rallied back up to the 50 MA put in a nice high base, which is a pretty interesting thing to see in a downtrend and trace to higher swing low.
NEUT6|Right there, right?
NEUT7|So let me draw that in here.
NEUT8|Nice higher swing low.
NEUT9|Right and the stock then traced another.
BULL10|Possible higher swing low right there I said to myself that's a pretty good pull back to an area of support, right?
NEUT11|A lot of people on this last phone up from here to here.
BEAR12|He got hurt and they're going to want out when the stock pulls back.
NEUT13|So that can be an area of support doesn't have to be a great one to give me what I want, right?
BEAR14|So on the next day when this stock opened a gap, so my stop limit or order never got filled it will gapped up past the limit portion of my stop limit order.
NEUT15|But I kept the order in just to see if I could get a filling the pool back in the next day I got filled on that trade right?
NEUT16|So little bit speculative.
NEUT17|I know I'm in a pretty nice established downtrend, but I do have an inverse head and shoulders now.
NEUT18|Is a solder and solder or a shoulder and head so you get the idea that stock is rounding now at the bottom.
NEUT19|Trying to show a little bit of strength, but I do have the 100M A overhead as well as the 200.
BEAR20|The 100 could be problematic.
NEUT21|The 200 so far away.
BEAR22|I'm still going to be so far past break even on this trade.
BULL23|I'll be in good shape.
NEUT24|I'll be taking money off the table as well so this talk actually goes in my favor.
NEUT25|Runs right up to a logical area of resistance.
NEUT26|It's right through here I'll draw a line across that.
BULL27|That would be a great place to look for this stock to put in some resistance.
NEUT28|In that area, and it's also right at the 100 MA.
NEUT29|Alright, so no big deal.
NEUT30|I move my stop to break even playing with the house.
NEUT31|Money always feels good.
BULL32|Big psychological edge there, and the stock actually breaks out of that.
BULL33|Which is great.
NEUT34|Alright, next couple days go by and on that day right there tored the end of the day.
NEUT35|I exited half of trade.
NEUT36|For nice gain and I still at three point gain, let the other half go for just a couple of days.
NEUT37|And on that day right there I got out of the other half.
NEUT38|And the reason is not because it didn't have room up to the 200 MA, or because the logical place resistance on this chart was back here.
BULL39|Is because earnings was coming up.
NEUT40|And I could have given it a little bit more room, but sometimes they will announce earnings early.
BULL41|So if I had stayed in a little bit longer, I might have been able to capitalize on that little move up there.
NEUT42|But sometimes earnings will announce early and they'll stop me out and I don't want to do that unless I have some good protection in the form of a hedge.
BEAR43|And actually, this earnings gap down so that was a turn out to be good move and that was within 12345 and then 678 days before earnings.
NEUT44|So again I could have traded that any better.
NEUT45|Maybe I probably could have bought some protection in the form of a put, but that would cost me some insurance had I wanted to stay in this, that's what I would have done except the 200M.
BEAR46|A big red was coming and I didn't want to fight through that.
NEUT47|So I live to fight another day.
NEUT48|Take a few good points off the table.
BULL49|And that ends up being a good trade.
BULL50|"Well, thanks for joining me on freetrainingvideos.com and I'll talk to you soon."""
