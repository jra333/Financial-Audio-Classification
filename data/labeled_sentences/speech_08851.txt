BEAR0|"""Amazon is out with its earnings results."
NEUT1|Jerrod Blicker has those numbers for sharing.
BULL2|We got some big beats here and the stock is up 1% in the postmark, and that's after being up 1 1/2% before the Bell.
BULL3|Today we see a third quarter net sales coming in at $96.1 billion, and that handily beats the estimates of $92.71 billion.
BULL4|That's for one quarter up, 37% year over year and EPS, and even bigger beat $12.37 versus $7.55.
BULL5|And that's versus a year ago, $4.23.
BULL6|Basically tripling that EPS number from a year ago, third quarter, third quarter operating income $6.2 billion.
BULL7|That's up 96% year over year almost doubled.
NEUT8|Estimate was for 4.73 billion.
NEUT9|So on those headline numbers really knocking it out of the park just a few other tidbits here.
NEUT10|Operating margin 6.4% North American segment sales coming in at $59.4 billion and then their prime day, which they.
NEUT11|As we know, they moved into the month of October here that is being disclosed as having $3.5 billion in 3rd party sales.
NEUT12|So I don't believe we're going to.
NEUT13|I don't believe we're going to be getting the full effect of that until the following quarter, but interesting to know here.
BULL14|So big beats on both the top and bottom lines here.
NEUT15|Just looking for some other segment service sales $43.4 billion in revenue and international segment sales $25.17 billion here.
NEUT16|And guys just to jump in on Amazon in some ways we fully expected these kind of beats, right?
NEUT17|But the narrative has shifted during Covid, we've seen huge huge ecommerce urges, you know?
NEUT18|So in some ways, this is SOP for Amazon.
NEUT19|These kind of games.
BULL20|But at the same time we've seen huge gains for Best Buy Target on line.
NEUT21|Only retailers like Wayfair, Etsy, and what's interesting to me.
NEUT22|In this earnings press release, Bezos starts the whole letter by talking about Amazon, bringing its minimum wage two years ago, up to $15.00 an hour.
NEUT23|This time, challenges specifically.
NEUT24|Best Buy and Target to do the same.
NEUT25|And it's no surprise to name those two companies which have seen big big boosts during the pandemic and other one is Urban Outfitters.
NEUT26|So many of these brick and mortar retailers ****** Sporting Goods.
NEUT27|I could keep going have seen these huge surges in e-commerce so it's me.
NEUT28|The larger story here in Amazon is of course the biggest part of it, but now you're seeing other names that had previously not seen these surges.
NEUT29|The biggest story is the dramatic acceleration.
NEUT30|We're now going to see in what percentage of all US retail happens on line.
NEUT31|It has jumped and I don't think it's ever going to go back.
NEUT32|You know, certainly that was a big question.
NEUT33|You're going into this just whether or not Amazon was going to live up to some of those expectations are certainly looking at least at these numbers.
BEAR34|"And also their fourth quarter guidance there exceeding the street expectation."""
