BEAR0|"""You know why so many bears keep getting this market wrong?"
NEUT1|It's the Fed.
NEUT2|They know nothing on a day where the Fed presented the results of its monthly meeting.
BEAR3|Surprise, surprise, they kept rates low.
NEUT4|We'd hear endless chatter about how the stock markets in a bubble of the feds making.
NEUT5|After good day.
BEAR6|Tailgating 160 points doesn't jump 1.24%.
BEAR7|NASDAQ fell 1.35%.
NEUT8|You need to know that I think this is totally nuts.
NEUT9|Yeah right, the all powerful fed create an environment where equity is the only asset class worth owning.
NEUT10|Bonds are for suckers.
NEUT11|It's all our central bank.
NEUT12|Possibly set assistance, let's say of what the Bavarian Illuminati?
NEUT13|How about the Freemasons?
BEAR14|You know what I am sick and tired of hearing that we're in a bubble that the feds over inflating the price of stocks by printing money to keep the economy moving.
NEUT15|We've not this morning economy than just the Federal Reserve.
NEUT16|And there's certainly more to the stock market.
NEUT17|1st, I'm not saying that they don't matter.
BEAR18|Of course it's important in theory they could raise short term rates to three or 4/5, and yeah, that would crush the stock market among other things.
BULL19|I know that would make the Bears very happy.
BULL20|I can practically hear them coming on air and praising the Fed for giving investors a reasonable alternative with higher short term rates.
NEUT21|But you really think these critics believe a series of rate hikes would actually be good for any asset class.
BULL22|Do you think higher rates would produce more jobs or better economy?
NEUT23|Kind of important in it.
NEUT24|Of course not.
BEAR25|See they would put millions of people out of work and cause a wave bankruptcies and for what a better return from CDs.
NEUT26|Well, there's something worth fighting for.
NEUT27|Let me be crystal clear, the bearish money managers who want rate hikes don't care about any of this collateral damage.
NEUT28|They are talking their book, people.
NEUT29|Hey, I was a money manager.
NEUT30|I've heard hear them.
NEUT31|I know what they're doing.
BEAR32|They missed out on the rally and they need stocks to go down.
BEAR33|Or else their hedge funds will go out of business.
NEUT34|It's about marketing people, end of story.
NEUT35|There's no rational reason.
NEUT36|Race interest rates with double digit unemployment.
BEAR37|Paltry inflation.
