BEAR0|"""We have also heard from Goldman Sachs economists saying that they predict a rate cut in each of the next two meetings, just because perhaps the Fed will want to keep bond markets."
NEUT1|Com.
NEUT2|What do you think?
BULL3|Yeah, I think that's a fair assessment.
NEUT4|I think if the Fed doesn't hit market expectations in the market, expects a rate cut in September and two more rate cuts after that.
NEUT5|If the market doesn't get those, hit those expectations.
BEAR6|If it doesn't, hit those market expectations, then markets will sell off.
BEAR7|Stock prices will decline.
BULL8|Credit spreads will widen value of the dollar increase and it will already shaken already.
BEAR9|Very shaky economy.
NEUT10|So yeah, I think the Federal Reserve really has to follow through here and hit those expectations.
BEAR11|And if they don't, of course we continue to see, as you say, the markets being pretty shaky.
NEUT12|The 2:10 curve repeatedly, now inverting this GTV chart on the Bloomberg, those showing that.
NEUT13|It perhaps is not being version that people care so much about, but the re step steepening of the yield curve you're seeing the asset prices, whether it's gold rising and the S&P 510 year bond prices falling, because is a re steepening one.
NEUT14|We're seeing those problems arise, so we're in the politics show if we're headed towards the 2020 election in November, when could we expect this?
NEUT15|Inevitability of an economic downturn to happen?
NEUT16|So are you asking when the next recession is that what you're asking?
BEAR17|Yeah, OK alright, well, you know I think recession risks are uncomfortably high and they're rising.
NEUT18|And I think the proximate cause for that is the trade war.
BEAR19|The trade war is doing very serious damage to the global economy and to the US economy.
BEAR20|European economy is on the precipice of recession.
BEAR21|In our economy is clearly slowing and threatens to go into recession.
NEUT22|So I think as long as the president continues to pursue.
BEAR23|The higher tariffs and the trade war odds of a recession in the next 12 months are pretty high, pretty high, and the Fed is going to work really hard to make sure that doesn't happen.
NEUT24|Thus, the rate cuts and then, that's that's why the Fed does not want to upset markets and cause markets to go down.
BEAR25|"But but it's going to be pretty tough for them to thread that needle."""
