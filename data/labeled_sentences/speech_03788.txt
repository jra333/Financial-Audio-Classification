NEUT0|"""What do you think was the most important thing?"
NEUT1|Buffett said that individual investors should know about investing well, so it's really it's.
NEUT2|I appreciate you asking that because it's the easiest question for me to answer, and that's because Warren Buffett said the most important investing lesson you could learn right now.
NEUT3|You know he's sort of very much telegraphed.
NEUT4|What exactly, that was he?
NEUT5|Has this sort of longstanding famous bet with.
NEUT6|Protege Partners which he made back in 2006 and it's essentially orason issued by the New York Fund, which was over a decade.
NEUT7|Predicting whether they committed returns of five hedge funds picked or the S&P 500 Vanguard Index would win and essentially buffets on the one side saying listen passive low cost indexing wins against this sort of fee.
NEUT8|Heavy, hyperactive hyper reactive management.
NEUT9|Style that hedge funds do and so far, and it's not quite.
NEUT10|It's not quite finished, but so far he's winning three to one.
BULL11|We're talking 60, some percent gains versus 27% gains.
BULL12|I want to say 21.9% return so far as at the end of 2015 versus 65.7% in the S&P 500.
NEUT13|Was showing that passive investing works that really.
NEUT14|It's sort of not.
NEUT15|It's not reacting to the day today, it's not freaking out about what one quarter earnings means or another quarter earnings means, but really just.
NEUT16|Sitting, watching and letting it ride.
BULL17|Yeah, and that's cool that you mentioned.
NEUT18|Vanguard Vanguard is a very, very low cost way to invest.
NEUT19|Their fees are so much lower than competitors most.
NEUT20|I think a lot of other funds, their fees run around 1%, which when you're investing is huge and Vanguard is like .05 I believe for their S&P.
NEUT21|Yeah yeah, it's it's a tremendously low cost fund and the point that Buffett really made here was that for many investors, even for most investors.
NEUT22|Passive low cost indexing is simply the way to go because it you know.
NEUT23|If you don't have the time to do sort of Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett style due diligence on a company.
NEUT24|"The answer really is something simple and just not reacting and letting the growth compound overtime."""
