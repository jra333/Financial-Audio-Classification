BULL0|"""Hello everybody, welcome back to case studies with engineering robot."
NEUT1|Today we're gonna be talking about Occidental Petroleum Corporation and we're going to be starting from December 2019 to June 2020.
NEUT2|So let's go and see what happened and what's happening in this market.
NEUT3|So as you guys can see, there is a buy 2 signal from engineering Robo on December 2019, but one month later, since the market is not going so well, there's a cell 2 signal from engineering rubber on January 2020.
NEUT4|So let's discuss about this cell signal.
NEUT5|Let's say that you wanted to buy from $100.
NEUT6|OK, here, here or you not to listen engineering or bust by signal and you wanted to buy from here.
NEUT7|OK, on December 2019 it doesn't really matter.
NEUT8|You can buy anywhere you want, but when it comes to cell signal over here on January 2020 Mini see his cell 2 signal.
BEAR9|If you didn't sell it, if you ignore engineering robust cell signal, you lost 79% of your money.
NEUT10|Justin Terry months.
BEAR11|Look at this down market, it goes down a lot in.
NEUT12|There's a cell to signal from engineering Robo because engineering or both trying to tell you the market is not going so well.
NEUT13|You have to sell it.
BEAR14|Otherwise you're going to be losing your money or your profit.
NEUT15|So it's so easy and basic.
NEUT16|If you still don't understand what cell.
NEUT17|Signal means or what they're trying to do.
BEAR18|That means you're going to be losing your money if you just keep ignoring the cell signals, you're going to be losing either your money or your profit.
NEUT19|So This is why when it comes to sell signals from engineering Robo, I highly recommend you guys to listen it.
NEUT20|There's one more cell, one signal in March 2020 over here, as you guys can see, but the first one is cell signal, which is really important if you sell it in here.
NEUT21|If you listen engineering or but you're going to keep your money in your pockets.
BEAR22|But if you don't listen, you're going to lose it.
NEUT23|It's basic.
BULL24|And after that, on a June 2020, I think the market is getting better, so there's a by two by one signal from engineering.
NEUT25|Urban rule will see what's going to happen after that.
