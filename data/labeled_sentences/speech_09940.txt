NEUT0|"""What would you say explains first of all, just the move that we've seen over the last couple of sessions?"
BULL1|Sure, Kelly, good to be here.
BEAR2|I think if you look back September was a terrible month.
BEAR3|It was for the market, but energy was even worse.
BULL4|So we've got a nice little recovery coming off.
BEAR5|A pretty terrible September moving crude from the high 30s to low 40s also helps.
NEUT6|And then you've got this thematic trade that's going on around cyclicals and low interest rates forever, so I think you put all those three things together and energy is having a nice October so far.
NEUT7|We were talking Dan about why energy was sitting out of the rebound trade for awhile.
NEUT8|It just seemed like, well, it has its own problems that has supply issues and you name it.
NEUT9|If you're somebody watching this, who thinks you know I'm going to bet on the recovery.
NEUT10|I'm going to bet on the rotation should you pick up these energy names or not?
NEUT11|I think the answer is yes, if you've got a reasonable time frame.
BEAR12|I mean trading wise, they've been all over the place, crude's not going to make a massive move to the upside anytime soon.
BEAR13|Feels like it's a bit trapped in this sort of high 30s low 40s area.
BEAR14|But I mean the reality is that that energy stocks could double and still only be flat for the year they've been so tough that there's real value there.
NEUT15|So the answer is yes, if you can take this volatility and I've got a reasonable time.
BEAR16|Yeah Exxon, which I think is one of the names you would recommend, is down 50% this year.
NEUT17|It has a 10% dividend yield.
BULL18|I think Chevron's up around 7% are those dividends safe?
NEUT19|Or are they simply just not that attractive because investors are so concerned about the capital losses?
BEAR20|I think people are worried about the energy transition.
NEUT21|They're worried about oil prices and you know energy has not been a good place to be, so you just sell the biggest names.
NEUT22|I don't know if Exxon's dividend is safe, but if they cut it in half, I bet the stock goes up right?
BULL23|The market would like to see sustainable numbers from these companies, and so my guess is Exxon is going to protect the dividend that's going to pay you while you wait.
NEUT24|It actually makes the stock you know they're going to borrow to pay that dividend.
NEUT25|It makes it one of the juiciest sort of highest leverage names to.
BULL26|The price is recovering 'cause if price gets better you know that dividend gets safer, so I think they're reasonably safe and even if they cut him, I think the stocks are still interesting.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
