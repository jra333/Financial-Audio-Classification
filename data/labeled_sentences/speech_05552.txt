NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol PFE."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, overall the chart is hanging in there another day where it's not like it was explosive in the upward direction or anything like that, but chart is maintaining above.
NEUT5|Not only this green line here that I talked about in past videos, so I realize this woman a little bit more of those that have watched past videos, but right there at 141 is definitely a key level to watch from.
NEUT6|Just more so.
NEUT7|The bigger picture point of view.
NEUT8|And I emphasize big picture 'cause I get it.
NEUT9|If you're a day trader and you bought right there, you probably don't care bout 41 dollars.
NEUT10|I mean you would have a much different perspective on things, but for those people that do care about the big picture perspective.
NEUT11|Then yeah, $41.00 as long as the price holds above, there would be great but also from the bull side of things is check out the price relative to that purple line there.
NEUT12|The 50.
BULL13|Moving average doing a fantastic job of cruising up along there.
BEAR14|Granted, if the price does drop down below there, that doesn't mean it's the end of the world or anything like that because again you still do have that $41.00 mark down around that area that would still give the price plenty of opportunity to build a nice overall higher base.
NEUT15|Now if the price would go down there and crash through there, well yeah that starts, you know to be a different conversation but.
NEUT16|As of now, that's not anywhere close to happening, so from the you know, the support side of things.
BULL17|All the levels of support that you would want to see hold are indeed holding, and that's a good step in the right direction.
NEUT18|Doesn't mean anything.
NEUT19|It's not like it's a guarantee.
NEUT20|But it's certainly what you would want to see from a preferable situation.
NEUT21|Now as far as areas of resistance are concerned, the big battleground, now that really stands out is right up here.
BEAR22|At $42.30 you can see that right there presented a problem there, presented a problem, and then even earlier on in the day, didn't hit it exactly, but got within the general vicinity of it and once again presented a problem.
NEUT23|So that's certainly the main break out area.
NEUT24|There are headed into Friday, but All in all, the charts hanging in there.
BULL25|Some good, healthy consolidation.
NEUT26|So it'll be interesting.
NEUT27|Interesting to see how this one closes out the week on Friday 1st off.
NEUT28|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT29|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT34|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT42|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
