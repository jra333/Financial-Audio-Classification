BEAR0|"""Still, I'm betting at this counter trend rally will not have legs when you look at the stocks that got hit today."
NEUT1|I don't think they're going to stay down.
NEUT2|The cyclical sold off in those emotionally charged, highly personal, and downright scary comments from the CDC chief that would those shook me to the core if she hadn't dropped that line about impending doom, we might have spent more time considering the possibility the whole country could be vaccinated by May, or at least the part of the country that's willing to get shot.
BULL3|So much for success tomorrow.
NEUT4|My, my guess is, we'll forget about Archegos and begin to distance ourselves from these impending doom comments.
NEUT5|Uh, there's still probably some marquee ghosts fallout, but you know what I mean?
NEUT6|Our kids were going to say like, Wow, yeah, that was that argue goes the great reopening trade should come right back.
NEUT7|So I take a hard look at Disney and Boeing.
BULL8|The accelerated vaccination timetable means Disney's move movie and theme park businesses can go back to normal sooner than we expected.
NEUT9|Meanwhile, Boeing just wanted big order from Southwest Air that was supposed to go frankly to Airbus.
BULL10|That 787 Dreamliner was just approved for Sale by the FAA after multi month suspension.
BULL11|These are huge positives and I think the stock would have rallied more.
NEUT12|A lot more than 2%.
NEUT13|If we hadn't spent the whole day worrying about impending doom.
NEUT14|By the way, I still like I like the banks now they come down, we just we just have to hear from every one of them before we can get involved.
NEUT15|But the most important lesson today is this market is fickle, so don't dump the counter trend stocks when they're going down.
NEUT16|If you're patient, there's almost always a better time.
NEUT17|Today, was that better time, bottom line, sooner or later the rotation will change directions, meaning money will flow back to the great reopening stocks.
NEUT18|The banks of the circles.
NEUT19|So you want to use days like today and perhaps tomorrow.
NEUT20|To buy them into weakness while you trim your positions, it did lock down stops.
