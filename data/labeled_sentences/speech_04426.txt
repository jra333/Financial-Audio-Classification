NEUT0|"""We saw the same thing today in B&G Foods."
NEUT1|You know we've had them one bed bath.
NEUT2|We've had them onto, they've got short positions of 36% and 63% respectively.
NEUT3|They're going after rocket mortgage with a 31% short.
BEAR4|It's crazy out there.
BEAR5|Bed bath beyond stock, which opened up for 34, then leaped to 47, squeezed out by the cheerleading smaller investors, and then it plummeted $30.68 to finish up just $0.47 to squeeze.
NEUT6|Didn't stick.
NEUT7|My advice to the shorts, I'm not going to give any advice to the Wall Street Reddit crowd.
NEUT8|They're making a lot of money, but my advice to the shortstop crowding into the same trades.
NEUT9|Yourself open this kind of action.
NEUT10|You'll never know who Wall Street bets will target next.
NEUT11|Now.
NEUT12|Not all of these targeted buying campaigns are about busting the shorts.
NEUT13|Some of these talks they aim for are genuinely loved and they think are very undervalued.
NEUT14|Here.
NEUT15|I'm thinking BlackBerry.
BULL16|It's got a good software business Palantir, both of which had gargantuan runs today.
NEUT17|They're so loved in the Wall Street best crowd doesn't seem to want to stop by at these levels.
NEUT18|They always look at use these targets like the analysts were too enthusiastic, but as entertaining as these moves are, this stuff is only.
NEUT19|A side show at the end of the day, I don't think a Reddit form can bring the house down there.
BEAR20|Picking undervalued stocks better big short position and running with him and that can cause crazy moves and a handful of stocks, but it's not big enough to move the entire market.
NEUT21|Come on.
NEUT22|What really matters now?
NEUT23|Is that we have a stock pickers market for the first time in 20 odd years?
NEUT24|This is a market that rewards individual companies from being well run and that means stocks are less sensitive to the broader economy than they used to be.
NEUT25|Now we know many of the biggest winners thrive in a shutdown because they enable the stay at home economy.
NEUT26|Remember that stayed on the car.
NEUT27|We've got three that just yeah, indices galore to show this stuff.
BEAR28|I think most of tech has gotten overheated these levels.
BEAR29|The endless price target boost for the same induction Apple are very unnerving to me.
BEAR30|They set a high bar that can hurt the market.
NEUT31|There's a whole quality stocks that are.
NEUT32|Roared from Microsoft.
BEAR33|That Tesla, Boeing, AMD, and they could really hurt us if they get hit with a big battle profit taking all at once.
NEUT34|But of these, only apples at its highs right now, Meanwhile want to copy reports.
BEAR35|A decent quarter is Kimberly Clark it today the stock source hated the Crocs, followed up and simply wanted 22 points of four stocks go down just as much when they disappoint.
NEUT36|And that's what happened to IBM last week.
NEUT37|It's a market of stocks people, so the bottom line, with the exception of a handful of gigantic tech place, there isn't a stock out there that's big enough to bring down this market.
BULL38|If anything, the quality of earnings this week starting with J tomorrow which is not at all sense of the economy, could be a terrific sign that made big cap stocks are immune to a slowdown.
NEUT39|And unperturbed by the crazy action in marginal names like GameStop or being seafood, or even a rocking horse in bed, bath and beyond.
