NEUT0|"""Hey guys welcome back to Aust Ridge investing where our goal is to debate specific stock investment ideas."
NEUT1|Quick one for you.
NEUT2|Today we need to get to 1000 subscribers so I can unlock the survey function in YouTube, but for now we'll just have to hack our way through it.
NEUT3|We're just going to do a quick.
NEUT4|Which video should I do next?
NEUT5|So here's the four options for today.
NEUT6|1st is Kraft Heinz.
NEUT7|We all know it.
NEUT8|We all know their product's 3G in Berkshire Hathaway, back to merger from 2015.
BEAR9|Definitely been a disappointment for investors.
NEUT10|Cost cutting, brand erosion, consumer trends towards healthier foods.
BULL11|But COVID-19 seen some increased demand for their product.
NEUT12|People going to grocery stores and stocking up on some of the non perishable items.
NEUT13|Could look at whether this is a turning point for investors in the Kraft Heinz story.
NEUT14|That's door number one.
NEUT15|Door #2 is a very different story.
BULL16|Shopify after the March sell off the stock has bounced back and made new all time highs as I'm speaking today it was off a bit today but it's basically come back on the new all time highs.
NEUT17|E-commerce name is defying Covid gravity Al Air Jordan.
NEUT18|I've just been watching that new Netflix documentary that came out which is awesome so that's option #2 Shopify.
BEAR19|Option #3 is Disney Parks and cruises are closed, but Disney Plus is open stocks down 50% since the December 2019 highs.
NEUT20|So is this an opportunity for longer term investors?
NEUT21|Note that there's about a 2% dividend yield still being paid, and for the time being.
BEAR22|And then last choice is American Express credit card business, but unlike MasterCard and Visa, it does have some credit exposure, so it's not just a processor stocks down 40% since February and trading at less than 10 * 2019 earnings and has about a 2% dividend yield.
NEUT23|So those are your four options.
NEUT24|I'll put each ticker down in the comment below and please like the one that you want to you want to see the next video on and the one with the next vote.
NEUT25|The one with the most votes will be the one that I do next.
