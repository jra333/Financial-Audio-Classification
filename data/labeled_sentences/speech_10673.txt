NEUT0|"""Yesterday we're talking about Tesla."
NEUT1|You prefer the Elon Musk as PT Barnum, Barnum, and Bailey circus.
BULL2|Right, right, very successful.
NEUT3|How he conducts his earnings calls me.
NEUT4|Can you name me any other person who ran a circus?
NEUT5|I can't name you another stock that would have been down a lot more than that.
NEUT6|I mean, it might be circus Maximus.
BEAR7|For all I know Circus Muska missed.
NEUT8|Want to see about that one?
NEUT9|Trademarks as well.
NEUT10|So so First off you know, can you indeed verify that you are real?
NEUT11|I struggle, I struggle.
NEUT12|I've been at this for a long time.
NEUT13|It's entirely possible that I am now some sort of I don't know simulation, although if you are he would be 2 as well.
NEUT14|He's a double simulation now.
NEUT15|Look, he's a brilliant man.
NEUT16|But you know the first line of the conference call is the million Robo taxis.
NEUT17|That's why you know that guy got me going.
BEAR18|The idea that the numbers weren't that good.
NEUT19|It's OK, like you could say the numbers aren't the raising of capital which bankers going to raise it.
NEUT20|I have their internal contradictions to this to this man.
NEUT21|And here's what I want to say to him.
NEUT22|There was a piece about you Elon in New York Times written by Jim Stewart and I said on air and I will repeat again.
NEUT23|Listen when I'm there.
NEUT24|I am there for you because I believe in you.
NEUT25|But I don't believe in the trash talk.
NEUT26|OK, I don't believe in this notion that you have to just run yourself into the ground.
NEUT27|I'm going to say this right now.
BEAR28|This simulation is worried about you.
NEUT29|So the one thing I do have to ask as investors do and I know there are a lot of predictions were talking full autonomous.
NEUT30|I think in like a year.
NEUT31|65,000 delivers in the first quarter, but he's still targeting 400,000.
NEUT32|He's saying that all the existing cars today can be autonomous.
NEUT33|We're talking robo taxis.
NEUT34|I think a million texts can we.
NEUT35|Can we put patients at directions you don't need to do that?
NEUT36|I mean, I want to, but not that want to like reach in and give him a hug.
NEUT37|I don't think it's like a high.
NEUT38|I'm not really like a hug.
NEUT39|I ain't got the impresses me as being a hug I, you know, maybe it's a fist pump guy, but you know, I'm going to go a little something.
NEUT40|I want to apologize the moment that he stops with hey, I'm going to do this this, this, this because all we want.
NEUT41|Is Kars is course.
BULL42|You're great.
NEUT43|I want to test it.
NEUT44|When I drove a Tesla.
NEUT45|I absolutely love it.
NEUT46|I mean, like I looked it right.
NEUT47|Nobody doubts alright, I built a charge pad before anyone had a charge back at my end.
NEUT48|I put a charge Petit for him.
NEUT49|OK, but this stuff that he's doing with the talking in the talking.
NEUT50|No, they listen speak softly, carry a big car.
NEUT51|You got a number I am going to give it even come on air.
NEUT52|I know that he's a black whole thing.
NEUT53|You just Craven Craven as ever.
NEUT54|I ain't craving.
NEUT55|I just I just crave truth.
NEUT56|Alright, circus musculus, you got it.
BULL57|"That's good."""
