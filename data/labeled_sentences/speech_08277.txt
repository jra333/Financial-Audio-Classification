BEAR0|"""Now Jimmy, a lot of people were upset with the 3.5 million share offering that they were looking to do an that did kind of decrease the price quite a bit, right?"
NEUT1|You've seen it in the beginning of the day.
BEAR2|We've seen a large decrease of this price from $194.00 down to $155 here and then.
BULL3|Once we've seen it open, we did see that large increase, just like we've seen with AMC.
BEAR4|And then it decreased a little bit up to 195, actually.
NEUT5|So you could have made a decent amount of money if you were looking today.
NEUT6|Traded or swing trader.
NEUT7|Whatever you're looking to do.
BEAR8|But then you could see that did end up flattening out to where it did finish at $186 only down 2% when in the pre market it showed it was down like 15 percent 16%.
BULL9|It's absolutely huge to be able to come back and be only down 2%, so it shows a lot of strength and buying power.
NEUT10|And I definitely wanted to get in there at $100 and drive that price of the 200.
NEUT11|But you know I can't win them all.
NEUT12|"So let's see how tomorrow goes and if we can make some profit there."""
