BULL0|"""Hello everyone again."
NEUT1|Welcome to these knew.
NEUT2|Supply demand in stock analysis.
NEUT3|This time for Berkshire Hathaway Ticker B Air K dot B.
NEUT4|This is the trading disclaimer.
NEUT5|You can pause the video and radiate at anytime.
NEUT6|OK, this is an update from a previous analysis.
NEUT7|We were doing an analysis when price was like down there and we were saying specifically that we were waiting for prices to rally and that is exactly what he has been doing.
BULL8|We are expecting press 2 rallying higher higher.
NEUT9|In the fourth coming weeks based on price, action and supply demand imbalance, remember that this is a weekly time frame.
NEUT10|Is the ticker and this is the well W stands for the weekly time frame.
NEUT11|Every single candle stick here represents and week of time, so this is not intraday trading day trading or scalping.
NEUT12|But you can use these bigger timeframe areas of demand in order to go wrong or short using smaller timeframes even indicators and.
NEUT13|Oscillators we don't really need them when we are training supply in many months, but obviously you can use whatever you want in your trading.
NEUT14|It's up to you.
NEUT15|But like I said, we can use this analysis.
NEUT16|This price, action and supply demand technical analysis to forecast what is going to happen in the next few in the near future, which is what is happening here on Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL17|We're expecting like I said, price to rally March higher.
NEUT18|Well, how long will that take?
NEUT19|I don't know will that happen.
NEUT20|I don't know either.
NEUT21|I do know that we have bullish bias.
NEUT22|We're expecting that to happen, but we are not assuming that.
NEUT23|So there's a big difference between.
NEUT24|Affecting something and assuming something.
BULL25|So like I said, bullish bias on Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT26|You can refer to the previous recording posted in my YouTube channel to review what was said few weeks ago.
NEUT27|Remember that a single time frame is not enough to make a trade in decision, and this analysis is not a signal service.
NEUT28|You have to know what you're doing.
NEUT29|You have to have a training plan and put everything into context by doing a top down analysis.
NEUT30|If you are interested how to trade, these imbalances went to trade here.
NEUT31|What to do?
NEUT32|What not to do then?
NEUT33|You are welcome to join us at the certificate or community where you will learn how to trade without using any kind of indicators.
NEUT34|No isolators, no needs, no fundamentals, no volume.
NEUT35|Nothing like that.
NEUT36|You think that's possible?
NEUT37|Well, it is can show you and many traders in the training communityinsteadof.com community.
NEUT38|They are seeing that every single day with trade setups and analysis posted way before price retraces the dogs imbalances.
NEUT39|So this is not after the fact trading or hindsight trading anybody can do that.
NEUT40|Enjoy the rest of the day and stay safe and be happy.
NEUT41|"Bye bye."""
