NEUT0|"""Hey guys this is Andrew richardsonsensors.com so let me quickly introduce myself."
NEUT1|I've been working as a professional trader for the past six years in Hong Kong.
NEUT2|On the option market and of the studied guys to make some YouTube videos because I want to show you everything I do at work.
NEUT3|All the different tools and techniques that I use that work for me.
NEUT4|And most importantly yes, I want to show you how to use it yourself.
NEUT5|So if you want to know about all this stuff and basically how to make money on the markets you guys are in the right place.
NEUT6|So today I want to make an update on AMC.
NEUT7|Let's get into it.
BEAR8|So AMC guys, I've done a lot of videos on this stock recently an I was basically showing you that we you know we have the volumes going lower.
NEUT9|Here.
BULL10|We have this 12345 move up that is correcting.
NEUT11|Right now we're looking for an ABC.
NEUT12|An AVC is actually happening this.
NEUT13|Alright, so here I was telling you careful, you know I'm bullish guys just to make it clear.
NEUT14|But I should do that.
NEUT15|You know, my target is 3/5.
NEUT16|I found it with different methods.
NEUT17|I saw a big option expiry in June.
NEUT18|I don't see it in April or May, so this is telling me that you know things are going to happen but later.
BEAR19|So for the short term mutual right now I was slightly bearish at this level because I was looking for an NBC.
NEUT20|We having this ABC right now.
NEUT21|But once again guys a real ABC you have to see wave that is lower so going to 750 would actually make sense for me before.
BULL22|Of course a strong move up so.
NEUT23|We are actually trying to understand what is happening, so let's go on the show the time frame.
NEUT24|So we're looking for support levels that are going to tell us if yes or no, we go to 7:15.
NEUT25|I have one that I can get just by the lowest level in the most recent past is 818 and look what I have on the four hours time frame, which is the most important one?
NEUT26|Yes, if you don't know where to start, always start from the four hours timeframe.
NEUT27|Yes, it's the most used ones is the one when you have the best reactions.
NEUT28|So on the first time frame, look at that 200.
NEUT29|Moving average.
NEUT30|The King of the moving average.
NEUT31|Or maybe the Queen of moving averages.
NEUT32|I mean it do most used one Ann is the one that is actually giving you same, the best reactions and here where is it?
NEUT33|It's roughly the same level nine 880.
NEUT34|So all this area is actually an area of support, so maybe we're going to see something like this on Monday.
BULL35|Definitely hear the momentum is bearish guys.
NEUT36|Alright, the magazine is negative, the Magna signal is red, so it's the difference between the magazine and the nine day exponential moving average of the magazine.
NEUT37|Itself, this is how to make the signal is computed and it is red, so we're going lower, so maybe we're going to see something like this.
NEUT38|And here bouncing back around doing a 12345 maybe and the other scenario that to me is more likely is that you know we go here and we break it guys and we go here and then we start moving higher.
NEUT39|Careful what is going to happen at the 880 level.
NEUT40|It's very interesting if we break this one on the far West time frame.
NEUT41|So if we trade between 5:00 and eight hours so you have two candles on the four hours time frame.
NEUT42|Then we probably gonna go to 7:50.
NEUT43|I mean, I don't see what can hold AMC to reach this level if we break 818, but ultimately of course guys it's gonna come back and trade hyeran we gonna go to probably 25 correct and 35 and then we're going to see what is happening.
NEUT44|So that's it for me.
NEUT45|I hope you guys enjoyed this video and if you did, please don't forget to click on the sub like another term.
NEUT46|So you're going to be the first to know when I plot anything new and stay close to shore.
NEUT47|"As you guys."""
