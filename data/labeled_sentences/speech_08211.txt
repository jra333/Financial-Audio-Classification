NEUT0|"""It's called in this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute I.
NEUT3|Offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|While quite the turn around today, I mean in fact a very crazy turn around when you think about it that just on Thursday, or excuse me Friday, the price collapse during the last 30 minutes of the day was all the way down here and now it's on the price is all the way up there so very very impressive movement.
BULL5|Very impressive.
NEUT6|Turn around here and now.
NEUT7|It's just a question of, you know the price continue to build upon this moving forward.
NEUT8|So let's see what happens with it.
NEUT9|But let's map out some new levels of support here.
NEUT10|So when the newest levels of support, what I would call the ideal lover cycling would make this chart look the absolute best.
NEUT11|Going forward.
NEUT12|That would be if the price can now stay up above 126.
NEUT13|75 now don't get me wrong.
NEUT14|If the price falls below one 2675.
NEUT15|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL16|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT17|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT18|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT21|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging in the health of the move.
NEUT22|That right there is what I'm defining as the move again from the crazy close on Friday to where it is right now.
NEUT23|So again, the health of that.
NEUT24|Just watch that Purple Line and as long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT25|Her best visualize that that is what is being represented again once stand above one 2675 would be fantastic.
NEUT26|However, from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|Main battleground Watch moving Forward is now all about that pink line up there.
NEUT28|That 200.
NEUT29|Moving average, which valued right now right at $130 exactly.
BULL30|So keep an eye on that, but All in all, nice movement today.
BULL31|Let's see if the price can continue to build upon this momentum.
NEUT32|Moving forward.

NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL37|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
