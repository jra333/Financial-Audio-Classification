BULL0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to this new plan to manage stock analysis, this time for Facebook ticker FB we have bullish bias on Facebook."
NEUT1|This is the trading disclaimer.
NEUT2|You can pause the video and read it at anytime.
NEUT3|OK, let's take a look at a longer time frame analysis on Facebook.
NEUT4|This is the multi time frame as you can read here in the middle of screen the watermark FB for Facebook 1 N means that every single candle stick represents amount of time.
NEUT5|All time has broken.
BEAR6|There's an imbalance over here and prices being trying to reach that imbalance for three months.
NEUT7|So long bias.
NEUT8|On Facebook or waiting for price will be traced on there or if it continues to rally there will be other imbalances created in another time frames.
NEUT9|You can use more time frames.
BEAR10|Like one hour even lower timeframes to scalp Facebook on the way up, and it weighed down.
NEUT11|That depends on what type of trader you are.
NEUT12|These are long term analysis and if you are trading other strategies which you are most most likely doing.
NEUT13|Because you will probably not know about supply and demand, you could use even indicators and oscillators to trade on the way up.
NEUT14|But remember bullish bias, long term breaking all time highs, so do if you're using RSI or Bollinger bands or whatever, and you've got here like the 80 and 20 mark.
NEUT15|Whatever I mean, try to buy when prices.
BEAR16|Over I mean over thought OK or oversold?
NEUT17|In this case when prices down underneath the 20 or whatever, then you can use that as a model, timeframes CC or whatever.
NEUT18|I'm not using that and know about these indications because I've traded in the past.
NEUT19|I've seen them work and all that so you can use it.
NEUT20|Depends whatever you want, but try to use them when prices and they need those buying points.
NEUT21|Then by do not buy when it is on the other end.
NEUT22|We do not try to sell OK because the bigger timeframe bullish bias is there and you don't want to wait to go against it.
NEUT23|But like I said, you don't really need that unless you are trading a few stocks over a few forced cross pairs where you have a limited watchlist.
NEUT24|Obviously you will be forced to trade a small time frames, but I'm not that kind of trader so I'm just looking at bigger timeframes and all that.
BULL25|I'm patiently waiting for price to retrace two very strong imbalances.
NEUT26|I don't need a 10.
NEUT27|Traits of aorta is a week or a month.
NEUT28|I need a few trades a year to hit my target and that's it.
NEUT29|So it all depends on what type of trading.
NEUT30|If you are.
NEUT31|And that doesn't mean that you are new or anybody else is going to make more money than me or somebody else because at the end of the day, you're going to be exposed as an intraday trader.
NEUT32|You're going to be exposed to many more trades and more psychological.
NEUT33|Impacts and stress than me where I'm going to have my own life doing everything I love without looking at the screen all day long, but that's way of life after all.
BULL34|But if right retraces over there, then think of going Long story short, it could continue to rally higher, mean the pre market is like rallying like 5-6 dollars so that could continue to rally higher.
NEUT35|So that could be good for shorter term trading.
NEUT36|And that's everything.
NEUT37|Remember that this is a single time frame analysis, not enough to make a train decision.
NEUT38|You will have to use their own time frames and your own rules.
NEUT39|If you are trading other strategies.
NEUT40|And this is not meant to be a signal service.

NEUT42|Enjoy the rest of the day and be happy.
NEUT43|"Bye bye."""
