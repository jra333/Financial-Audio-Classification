NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one.
BEAR5|Big pullback here.
NEUT6|And this is one of these were from where I sit presentation wise is a relatively tricky chart to talk about.
NEUT7|'cause there it all does depend on what your strategy was going and what do I mean.
NEUT8|Well, let's say you're some sort of daytrader flipper, scalper in cars.
NEUT9|Often you bought right there in your plan was to buy and sell within 25 minutes.
BEAR10|Well, from that perspective, the chart looks absolutely terrible because all the prices done since then is pull back.
NEUT11|However, from the grand scheme of things, I get it.
BULL12|Yeah, there has been a bigger pullback, but from the bigger picture the price does still have plenty drop tuning to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT13|And that's how long term uptrends are constructed.
NEUT14|Just higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time, and that's going to be the viewpoint that I talk about things from.
NEUT15|So if I sound crazy calling something Polish, my guess would be you probably had more data type mentality going into all this, and I'm not saying all this was going to happen, but just for example, saying let's say the price actually pulls back even further and goes down to the 134 mark.
NEUT16|So price comes to 134 behaves in that manner and then start to work the way back up right now.
NEUT17|Emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT18|What would you have while you have a set of those there, you'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT19|You'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT20|You'd have Lowe's down here, and if you envision each one of those stair steps would help from the big picture, you would still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward struction an that's named the game.
NEUT21|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL22|It's going to make progress forward, and in this situation, quote unquote progress again, being defined as 134 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|He area resistance right now.
NEUT24|Right up there at the one 3750 Mark.
NEUT25|So that will be the initial level to keep an eye on.
NEUT26|And then after that just simply where the party stopped and then today and that was up around one 3875.
NEUT27|But All in all, like I said, depending on how you look at things, everything is still perfectly fine.
NEUT28|So assuming that you're not a day trader and you didn't buy, you know up over 138 today, then everything is so perfectly fine.
NEUT29|The trend is fully in the Bulls favor, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT42|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
