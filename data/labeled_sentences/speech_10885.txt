NEUT0|"""Morgan Stanley's Karlos de Alba joining us now by phone to make the case for MP Carla's one of the few companies where I actually could say I've been to their only asset."
NEUT1|But out there on the Nevada state line with Jim Latinski and some of his team, certainly an MP materials lot of competition about Chinese competition.
NEUT2|How they have to send it there to process large parts of it.
NEUT3|What makes you bullish on the MP story?
BULL4|Yeah, definitely.
BULL5|Brian is very exciting asset that they have an opportunity that they are exploiting.
NEUT6|What makes us be positive on MP materials?
NEUT7|Is the outlook degrade outlook that we see for demand in in their key product, which is rare.
NEUT8|Errors that go into the magnet that power, electric vehicles and wind turbines and your.
BULL9|This is the future we see a significant growth in the use of these models to electric for the electrification trends that we are experiencing right now.
NEUT10|And that is what's going to drive demand for MP products.
BULL11|An we think is going to boost the price of the metals they produce.
NEUT12|Yeah, and we're going to say words like neodymium and praseodymium without getting into the exact elements of because there's a lot of things that these go into.
NEUT13|What are their key product markets going to be?
NEUT14|Carlos yeah, there are two particular key markets for them and for the NDR in the PR, which are the easiest way to pronounce the elements that they would use.
NEUT15|One of those is electric vehicles, and the 2nd is wind turbines.
NEUT16|When you looked at.
NEUT17|The transition or transformation that we're experiencing today in in the auto sector it is going to be very important for rare earths as they consume around 2.8 kilograms per electric vehicle and that compares with less than one kilogram, around .8 kilograms per current.
NEUT18|In combustion engine car that we that we drive today.
NEUT19|And when you looked at the wind turbines those are offshore are the ones that really will.
NEUT20|Drive the demand for the type of magnets that use the product that NP produces.
NEUT21|Those consume around 650 kilograms of permanent magnets per MW of capacity, versus the between 80 to 160 kilograms per MW that are used in the geared turbines that we use that we use today.
NEUT22|Carlos de Alba with a $57 price target, still sees about 10 plus percent of upside there and MP materials.
BULL23|Karleusa pleasure to get you on the program.
BULL24|Thank you very much.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT26|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
