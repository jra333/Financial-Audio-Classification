BEAR0|"""Saga of Donald Trump in Washington may be taking a toll on the president's support, the latest Bloomberg National poll shows that confidence in the new administration's ability to get the job done is waning here to take us through."
NEUT1|It is Bloomberg chief Washington correspondent Kevin Cirilli, so not much good news in this poll, Kevin.
NEUT2|Not much good news in terms of an approval rating.
NEUT3|The president has about a 40% approval rating.
BEAR4|56% of Americans disapproving of his numbers.
NEUT5|But if you look at the his where he stands on jobs and creating jobs in the economy, 47% of those polled in this new Bloomberg poll say that they do approve of that, compared with 40% of those who disapprove and on economic issues, 46% approving versus 44% so.
BEAR6|He's actually weakest David on healthcare.
BEAR7|Of course, that has hit a wrench, so to speak, over the weekend with the Senate Majority Leader saying that the vote won't come until at least Thursday.
NEUT8|But with Senator John McCain's health in question, it's really anyone's guess as to whether or not they would even be able to bring it to a vote should they hit number one, have the votes.
NEUT9|But if they wouldn't be able to have Senator McCain in town to vote on it, so Kevin, we showed a chart while you were talking, not only overall approval rating, but also specifically in the area of economics.
BULL10|That was a little bit better for the president.
BULL11|People seem to have more confidence in how he's handling the economy.
NEUT12|Yeah, David and I think that's why you're seeing the president this week.
NEUT13|Pivot to focusing on what he's calling made in America Week, and he's really feel that their strongest with their base.
NEUT14|And on those particular issues.
NEUT15|But in terms of actually being able to craft some type of major policy, he really needs to work with Congress to do that on health care.
NEUT16|And right now it's unclear whether or not he'll be able to get that done.
BEAR17|He's actually weakest according to this new Bloomberg poll on Healthcare.
BULL18|"In particular, with only 28% of Americans saying that he is, he's done a good job in handling that, OK?"""
