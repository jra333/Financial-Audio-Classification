BEAR0|"""Daejun oil down 21 Jim as the space between stocks and crude remains exceptionally large."
NEUT1|Look, I think the the crew futures distinguished themselves as being.
NEUT2|Let's just say, totally disingenuous there.
NEUT3|The idea of what happened last week with the minus 37 had to do with the fact that there's a financial instrument.
NEUT4|Couple of answers that are just wrong and they are broken.
NEUT5|We don't regard things is broken because it seems almost impossible that something could break, but the future that you see an the actual prices are very different particular in the out years.
NEUT6|Ann, I think about what's going to happen is this has to go to zero again.
NEUT7|Because we haven't any any more space.
NEUT8|I had heard John Hanson who's the CEO of the largest tanker company word American tanker on Friday and he said, look, there's no room, so why should this number not go to zero?
NEUT9|You should go to zero faster than he did last time, so we look at this and we want any chance who's doing it?
NEUT10|But it goes to 0.
NEUT11|Yeah, any chance that it doesn't?
BULL12|Because we will begin to look for tiny rebounds in gasoline demand as some of these states open well, I think that that's certainly a hope, but I also know that there are times in life where people know that there's an instrument.
NEUT13|That is faulty and they can shoot against that instrument and Bury these people.
BEAR14|I mean there is this financial problem.
NEUT15|The people who were behind the US so they are financial people.
NEUT16|And so if you're a real person or your large contractor large player, and I'm going to have this tonight in my in my show they can wipe out the USO and I think that that's been the that's been.
NEUT17|What's going on?
NEUT18|I mean, it's it's not a conspiracy, it's a reality.
NEUT19|When you have an organization that can't take delivery.
NEUT20|Well, you should crush that organization every time and that's what they will probably happen.
BULL21|"The people in the USOR naive the rookies and I wish him the best of luck."""
