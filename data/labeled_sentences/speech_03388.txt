BULL0|"""Good morning, good afternoon."
NEUT1|Good evening.
NEUT2|Traders from across the globe.
NEUT3|Listen, I gotta go really low video because I'm holding an Omni camp and I've got my campers upstairs in the office right now.
NEUT4|Looking at some charts.
NEUT5|So I ran down here to get out of quick video.
NEUT6|So listen up.
NEUT7|Alright, so this video is for trading on Sunday through Monday.
NEUT8|That would be September 14th, 2015.
NEUT9|Video #1371 traders.
BEAR10|Before we get into the video listen Futures Trading as we know is extremely risky, causes substantial financial loss.
NEUT11|Is not suitable for all traders.
NEUT12|Never trade without risk.
NEUT13|Capital you can afford to lose and always place stops first.
NEUT14|So let's get moving.
NEUT15|What are we going to do for Sunday through Monday in gold?
NEUT16|This is the gold chart that daily we've got a red Omni to start off Red Army in gold.
BULL17|We have been selling gold for quite some time and it has been fruitful on.
BEAR18|The is bearish again.
NEUT19|We expect gold eventually to end up all the way down here and you know play with this bottom of this channel somewhere down here.
NEUT20|So Red Army for gold.
NEUT21|On the site livealaska.com I will leave some parameters for you to trade inside of if you care to take a look quarter the omnipage at live with oscar.com and there will be some kind of a wreck for you there in the gold.
NEUT22|But there's something else really interesting I wanted to show you, so let's take a look at this.
NEUT23|We're going to go out really.
NEUT24|For now, we're going to take this out to a monthly and take a look at this chart.
NEUT25|Monthly Dow Jones Industrial Average monthly chart.
NEUT26|So these bars are extremely meaningful and these channels are extremely meaningful.
NEUT27|If you look you held here, you held here.
NEUT28|You held here.
NEUT29|On the downside you held here, you held here.
BULL30|You rallied up.
NEUT31|You held here.
BULL32|You came off a little.
BULL33|You rallied up again you healthy.
NEUT34|And now we're here.
NEUT35|Should it hold absolutely positively?
NEUT36|It should we also have to our to our.
BULL37|We're very thankful for this.
NEUT38|We've got a green Omni for trading on Sunday through Monday in the E Mini, S&P and the Dow, and in the Russell.
NEUT39|So looking at the Dow Jones monthly, it's all part of the same package.
NEUT40|We've got a green Omni.
BULL41|We expect this should hold.
NEUT42|I don't see why it wouldn't until this repetitive pattern stops repeating.
NEUT43|I say this is going to hold repetitive pattern, I mean this.
NEUT44|It gets to the line and holds an holds and holds an, holds an holes down side, gets to the line, hold it hold it probably will hold.
NEUT45|Here again we will take it one day at a con, but we will start off with the green Omni traders.
BULL46|I hope this will help keep you in tune.
NEUT47|I will do a. I will do a much more intricate video over the next couple of days.
NEUT48|Once on the camp is over but I did want to show this to you before market start moving on Sunday.
NEUT49|So if we go back to gold.
NEUT50|And we go back to a daily.
BULL51|It looks like it's going to be a pretty good trade.
NEUT52|The market looks like it's certainly going to cooperate on the downside and gold, so let's see where we go for Sunday through Monday.
NEUT53|That would be 9 fourteen 2015 traders.
NEUT54|Remember keep your emotions and of trading one of the best things you can do to help keep those emotions at Bay is say this over and over again.
NEUT55|Say this to yourself over and over again when you're in a trade and you know what?
NEUT56|Stops or is?
NEUT57|E motions.
BULL58|Traders thank you so much for tuning in an for once.
NEUT59|"Your ears didn't get blown out."""
