NEUT0|"""Welcome back to my channel guys and today we're going to talk about Neo."
NEUT1|Is it going to be the next Tesla?
NEUT2|Before we get into the analysis price predictions, I want to go into my Neo holding.
BULL3|So as you can see in my NEO stock, I'm up 8% and it was up about 12%.
NEUT4|I believe.
BEAR5|Earlier on today, as you can see, it's just falling a bit.
BULL6|I'm up 40% in total, Â£483 got 35 shares in it, faithfully 35.2 shares and.
NEUT7|The interesting thing is with Neo right?
NEUT8|Is this could be going to the moon.
NEUT9|Obviously I don't want to get my hopes up in things, but this could be a really hot stock for the next year or so.
NEUT10|So if you guys haven't got into Neo, I would recommend having a look at it, but I'm not saying buy into it because I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT11|But have some research into the company of alert.
NEUT12|You can see some of my previous videos on Neo if you want to, but I want to show you guys these price predictions 'cause I'm not sure if you guys have seen it or not.
NEUT13|So let's have a look.
NEUT14|As you can see you can see all the ratings of what these institutions are rating NEO and what they predict NEO should be and what it's worth and what it's valued at.
NEUT15|So as you can see on the screen it says JP Morgan.
NEUT16|Has put a price prediction of $75 and to be honest with you I thought it was Goldman Sachs.
NEUT17|I feel with Goldman Sachs that put that $75.00 so I'm not sure if that's an error there or an error on my end 'cause I put a little screenshot up as well of.
NEUT18|Another website saying it's Goldman Sachs and I've heard from someone else is Goldman Sachs, but either or they've predicted it to.
BULL19|They've been given a price upgrade to $75 a share, which is fantastic news for NEO shareholders.
BULL20|That's quite a big upgrade.
BULL21|To be fair, yeah, and it's probably helped the stock today.
BULL22|Hence it going up quite a lot.
NEUT23|And Neo Day has padam huge part of it.
NEUT24|People reacting really well with it, but this is where it gets a bit interesting.
NEUT25|Hopefully it's not too blurry on the screen 'cause the picture isn't great.
NEUT26|From the website got it off from 15 different analysts.
NEUT27|They've given a 12 month price forecast for Neo.
NEUT28|I can't believe it.
NEUT29|I really can't believe it.
NEUT30|Obviously they're not always right, but it's always good and nice to see when you're a Neo shareholder.
NEUT31|They predict the low will be $98 in the next 12 months and the median to be $427.00 and in the high to be $459.
NEUT32|So these are huge price upgrades so there there little price upgrades.
NEUT33|I wanted to show you guys.
NEUT34|And that's insane.
NEUT35|That's like insane price predictions.
NEUT36|And to be honest with you, if we look at some of the options of purple little screenshot of the option chain and all the calls and an interesting one is $70.00, strike price 14,000 contracts and people's brokerage accounts have a $70.00 strike price, which is very interested.
NEUT37|OK or per side by side of the puts and calls.
BULL38|And it's very interesting we've got so much volume and so many buyers.
NEUT39|On the Neo side, people are really, really liking this stock.
BULL40|As you can see when you compare the $70.00 strike price on a call compared to strike 19,000 contracts compared to 143, it's looking very bullish for NEO, which is a very very good sign.
