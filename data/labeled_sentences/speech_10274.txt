BULL0|"""Jim, it's our pleasure to wish you a happy birthday and it looks like the market is going to be a bit of a gift as well as some of the we mentioned Twitter seven year high this week."
BULL1|Yeah, just looking at Under Armour is going to open near an 18 month high.
NEUT2|Yeah Under Armour was terrific Twitter I thought showed that there are most salient line on that whole piece and edit.
NEUT3|Great interview with focus.
NEUT4|50 accounts have more than 25 million followers.
NEUT5|55 oh so may you may not miss one if you have others and particularly one that made it so that his absence.
NEUT6|Yes, I'm speaking up.
BULL7|The real Donald Trump has made, I think, put Twitter in the list of companies that you want to advertise with, along with along with Pinterest along with staff, because it's become less rancorous and there's very good evidence in that conference call that the less rancor, the more advertisers, so that's a big reason why I think Twitter is doing very well.
NEUT8|Jack Dorsey on the call.
NEUT9|Last night, guys talked about the fact that you are the audience for Twitter, 80% XUS and that it's much larger than just one account.
NEUT10|Here's what he said.
NEUT11|We are a platform that is obviously much larger than anyone topic or anyone account.
NEUT12|80% of our audience is outside the United States and we have more than 50 accounts with over 25 million followers.
NEUT13|Conversations on Twitter everyday or based on what's happening in the world.
BULL14|And we've proven in the past few years that if we do the work to serve the public conversation or daily audience growth.
BULL15|David, he said modest impact from that new Apple Privacy Initiative and at revenues up 28.
BULL16|That's the highest since Q3 of 18.
BULL17|Yeah, their total revenue number, the highest ever in 1/4 right?
BULL18|And as you point out, I think total ad revenue up 43% sequentially.
NEUT19|Ann Karl.
NEUT20|As we've noted, the stock is.
NEUT21|It's not like it's been sitting there quietly.
BULL22|It's been moving up dramatically into this earnings report, so adding perhaps as much as another 10% to the market.
NEUT23|The value of the company, even after what has been Jim, a very significant run into the print as we like to say when we talk about an earnings report and you know, then it focuses you in part on sort of the changing nature of where corporations are spending their ad dollars.
NEUT24|Yes, and this is about Super Bowl ads.
NEUT25|Almost all of them.
NEUT26|There's also a corollary in Twitter.
NEUT27|It's about direct.
NEUT28|They're going to be doing a lot more direct response, not just brand.
BEAR29|I reiterate, I think this is the tipping point quarter.
NEUT30|Go back to the Pinterest quarter when it broke out from the 25 seventies, go back to the snap quarter.
NEUT31|Of those were when when the advertisers recognize it's safe.
NEUT32|There is no dangerous place here that our stuff is going to go up against.
NEUT33|So David, I think that this is not the end of this move.
NEUT34|This is the beginning.
NEUT35|Pinterest, Beginning snap and now Twitter as a must buy as people try to figure out how to get in touch with younger international consumers, right?
NEUT36|But you know, but it's funny because Facebook is.
NEUT37|Not done much of anything.
BULL38|No this year, no, even though it would seem to be a beneficiary of all these trends and reported it quite what many people would say was quite a strong quarter.
NEUT39|And I mean, what 33% revenue growth?
BEAR40|If I remember, it was great that market didn't like it as market did not like it.
NEUT41|And yet you talk about these trends.
BULL42|Alphabet shares are up.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
