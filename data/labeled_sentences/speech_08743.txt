NEUT0|"""So here we are."
NEUT1|The debate is this.
NEUT2|How far will this bond repricing go?
NEUT3|Is it real inflation?
NEUT4|Is it a real momentous change?
NEUT5|Martin good morning.
BULL6|Good morning, my love.
NEUT7|Good Morning America.
NEUT8|We could easily see four two percent 10 year Treasury yields that will not be troublesome for the equity market, but we could see 3% ten year yields before the by the middle of the year.
BULL9|But 2% is probably doable before Easter.
NEUT10|You're saying 3% by the middle of this year, 2021 Martin.
NEUT11|Correct, and the reason is pretty simple.
NEUT12|You just mentioned the Nobel laureates, the academics, Krugman and Stiglitz with Daddy and Larry Summers.
NEUT13|And this goes back to basically core policy.
NEUT14|We have no breaks on policy.
NEUT15|We have the J&J show.
NEUT16|Jay Powell and Janice Yellen.
BULL17|Monetary is on full acceleration.
NEUT18|Fiscal is on super acceleration, So what gives?
NEUT19|And that's where the bond market comes into play and this goes back historically to take away the punch bowl from Bill Martin in October 1955.
NEUT20|Bob Ruben with Clinton in 1993, where Clinton was forced to hike taxes and Bernanke would taper caper in May 2013, so there's a lot of historical precedents here, but the bottom line is we have no break.
NEUT21|On policy we have super monetary super fiscal and this is the big change that's happened in in the last four weeks.
BULL22|Nominal GDP in America for this year has been upgraded to 7%.
BULL23|The budget deficit has been upgraded to 12%.
NEUT24|This is a super economy and the only break.
NEUT25|So come from a market discipline which is interest rates going higher.
NEUT26|OK, so let's extrapolate forward.
NEUT27|Martin, do you think that the Fed could even allow rates to get to 3%?
BEAR28|And would that cause a huge break on this melt up in assets that we have?
NEUT29|Let's deal with section A.
NEUT30|Would the Fed even allow rates to get to 3%?
NEUT31|Well, the the defense has has sort of no choice because you mentioned already.
BEAR32|You know that basically in Europe and in Japan we have negative policy.
BULL33|Rates were close to 0% in the UK were close to 0%.
BEAR34|In America we don't have negative policy rates in America, but we had for the last one to two years negative interest rates in America with a negative long term real rates were just about to pop positive come from minus 1 to 0% and we had a negative 10 year term premium.
BULL35|And that was almost minus one, and that has popped positive to plus 20 for the first time in two years.
NEUT36|So long term interest rate structure in America is the release valve.
NEUT37|We have no release Valve on monetary Jay Powell on like 1955 or Bernanke in 2013 is refusing to countenance any type of tightening and clearly you can see that Yellen at the start of the new administration has basically decided to do 10/12/13 percent deficit, so the deficit doesn't start with the American rescue plan on March 14.
BULL38|"It will continue later this year with an even larger American recovery plan."""
