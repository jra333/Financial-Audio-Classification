NEUT12|Now open and see what stock idea, but anyway, so just quickly I want to show you this about Pepsi.
NEUT13|The reason I want to talk about it because I personally feel like this is a really good stock that you should buy specially right now during the stock market crash.
NEUT14|The graph you know the chart that just can see for the past you know everything got affected because of everything that's going on right?
BEAR15|It dropped to literally like $103.00 under $4 right?
BULL16|And then right now you know, went back up to like $138.00.
NEUT17|But if we look at this chart throughout the whole year, we can see that it is a consistent graph.
BULL18|You know, it looks kind of flat in a little bit if we look at this for the past five years we can also see you know how it has been increased.
BULL19|Yeah, little down.
NEUT20|It goes down here and there, but the reason why I truly feel like Pepsi.
BULL21|It's such a good company is because Pepsi also owns other brands.
NEUT22|Now we can definitely see right here 15 brands.
NEUT23|He didn't know the owner by Pepsi or Coca Cola, so basically.
NEUT24|Pepsi also owns, for example, quicker for sure.

NEUT28|You know food snacks so you know a lot of people are talking about Pepsi and how it's a it's a really good stock to buy, especially at a moment like this.
BEAR29|Obviously everything was affected.
NEUT30|You can see in the graph, but it is conceived during the week.
