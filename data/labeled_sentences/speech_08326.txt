NEUT0|"""Yo when Christine, what's going on?"
NEUT1|It is December 18th, 2020 and the market is officially closed, so let's take a look at how everything broke down for this week.
NEUT2|So right in front of you is the chart of SMP that is SPX an as you recall last week I was looking for the market to continue to push higher.
BULL3|And to get to newer highs.
NEUT4|So what did it do?
NEUT5|It did just that.
NEUT6|So if you look.
NEUT7|We are at 3709 forty one for the clothes.
NEUT8|We made a new high this week of 3726 seventy so we made those new highs an it just continued to move an what do you think I think is going to happen.
BULL9|Yeah it's going to continue to move higher.
NEUT10|That's a no brainer right?
NEUT11|We got nothing in our way.
NEUT12|We have no clear signals of the market trying to do any reversal so why don't we stick to what we see?
NEUT13|Instead of what we think in right in front of our face, we see the market continue to move higher.
NEUT14|So let's go on market Christmas rally.
NEUT15|We know how it gets down.
NEUT16|So that is the SMP.
NEUT17|Let's go ahead and check out IWMOSIWM.
BULL18|That is if you remember the index fund for the Russell O IWM continue to move higher.
NEUT19|And what do we think is going to continue to do right?
BULL20|It is going to move higher.
NEUT21|It has nothing in his way right now, and it's just continuing to champion an.
BEAR22|We got low trading volume.
NEUT23|There's a lot of things factoring into how we can just continue to move higher.
NEUT24|So let's get our own way and make sure that we make money with the trend.
NEUT25|So IWM should continue.
NEUT26|Higher price target is around 200.
NEUT27|Forgot to say price target for.
NEUT28|SMP is still 4000, so that's as simple as I could put it.
