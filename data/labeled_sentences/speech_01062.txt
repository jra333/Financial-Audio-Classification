BULL0|"""Andrew, I see your assets under management here up to 100% since Cathy Wood announced that he was going to start that space ETF in January, I want to play a piece of the interview I did with Kathy last week where she spoke about space and her upcoming ETF."
NEUT1|Let's just take a quick listen to that and see if it's available there.
NEUT2|The costs associated with launching with rockets themselves with antenna.
BULL3|They're all coming down dramatically thanks to you know, both the private and the public sector, but I think the private sector has really helped NASA out here.
NEUT4|You've got Elon Musk.
NEUT5|You've got Jeff Bezos.
NEUT6|You've got Richard Branson in another way.
NEUT7|And on the technology technology side, we see SpaceX and Blue Origin pushing the envelope.
BEAR8|So costs are coming down.
BULL9|And the technology is are finally ready.
NEUT10|And obviously, Kathy is not saying when the when the ETF might actually be out there, but guys there there's some speculation out there in the press that since she made it in January, it's possible we could have an ETF announcement by the end of March.
NEUT11|I don't know.
NEUT12|Anybody want to weigh in on that?
NEUT13|And knowing Kathy would?
NEUT14|Any thoughts of what she might include in that ETF there?
NEUT15|Yeah, so I can jump in there.
NEUT16|She the good thing about Kathy is she really doesn't hide what she likes.
NEUT17|And you can already dig into some of their ETF's now ARKQ the autonomous technology and robotics ETF has a couple companies.
NEUT18|Once is Kratos defense and security solutions Katy OS, where it has it specializes in Direct Energy weapons and unmanned systems and satellites.
NEUT19|And there's another one also in San Diego area called Trimble, which has a water management software where they use.
NEUT20|Satellites to help farming as far as agriculture regarding water management control.
NEUT21|So she's got high conviction on those two.
NEUT22|You could probably guess they might end up in that ETF, and I think there are a lot of people that are dissecting her current ETF's to see what she might own in Ark X. Yeah, I like that a lot.
NEUT23|So Kratos is ktos, right?
NEUT24|The symbol on that.
NEUT25|Correct, yes.
NEUT26|Yeah, and Trimble is is what?
NEUT27|TRMB T as in Tom RMBI didn't know that simple, thank you.
NEUT28|That's those are two good guess.
NEUT29|Anybody else want to weigh in on any of those simultaneously?
NEUT30|They're going to.
NEUT31|Triple is actually one of our Holdings as well, so you certainly would be happy to see that getting added to other portfolios.
NEUT32|But you know one thing that hasn't been mentioned too much is her firm actually sub advises a fund out in Japan focused on the space industry as well.
NEUT33|"I believe through an essay or mutual fund with Co. Co am so you know someone could probably looked at to get some ideas as well as how she considers looking at the space industry."""
