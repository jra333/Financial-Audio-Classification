NEUT17|They make stars move off of 1 another, so let's go ahead and get right into it.
NEUT18|Organigram.
NEUT19|So basically whatever Tilray doing, that's what's gonna help.
BULL20|Or gaining ground to be able to go up in price Organigram we train at about 3:21 right now in pre market.
NEUT21|So we open at 295.
NEUT22|The high was 319 delois 288 the 52 year with 645 feet.
BEAR23|Two week lows in 101.
NEUT24|So let's check it out.
NEUT25|Yeah, let's look at the chart.
NEUT26|So if we look back on a one week chart we see your March you when the whole market was tank was tanking and we had a nice pool decoration.
BULL27|We see we had a nice deal by opportunity for you to get Organigram at 241 and I always told you always wait for deal by pullback opportunities.
BULL28|241 was awesome bye.
NEUT29|So graduates for the ones they got in and congratulations for the ones that still got in kind of late 'cause you still got a lot of potential to make money.
NEUT30|So at 241 a week ago, that's what we deal too.
NEUT31|So now we're trading at about.
BULL32|We recovered itself quite nicely.
NEUT33|That foot that do we do the 241 and recover fully from that whole deal?
BULL34|We got right back up to our resistance around three 2321.
NEUT35|Now from there, where do we need to breakthrough our next resistance?
NEUT36|Obviously I need legal.
NEUT37|If you look back on one month chart February 24th at 3:36.
NEUT38|So once you reach 3036 Cent, Organigram can shoot straight up can shoot straight up to around 356 soon as they break 336 he can shoot scheduled around 3:50 range and once you break that 350 range we look on a one month chart.
NEUT39|We going straight to $4.18 around four dollars, $4 for 2430.
NEUT40|Any weapon at range and soon as we break.
NEUT41|Or 18 then will be off to retest that.
BULL42|I own February 10th when we hit $6 a share will be able to retest that if we can breakthrough $4.18 cool, you know once we did get over $5, that's when the big boys better be on their radar, the Wall Street, they'll be able to buy.
BEAR43|They're getting this heavy.
