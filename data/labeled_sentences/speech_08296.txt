BEAR0|"""There's been a huge row over Labour's tax and spending plans this week."
BEAR1|The Conservatives say they'll blow a £1.2 trillion hole in the nation's finances, creating a tax bombshell.
BEAR2|Labour dismisses.
NEUT3|This is nonsense.
BULL4|It says higher tax will pay for day-to-day spending on things like more nurses and doctors.
NEUT5|And it will only borrow for higher capital spending, some £55 billion a year for transport.
NEUT6|Broadband green energy, hospitals and schools.
NEUT7|That's a lot more more than doubling current public sector investment plans.
BULL8|It's also a lot higher than the Conservatives promise.
BULL9|Labor plans would raise government investment back to levels last seen in the 1970s.
NEUT10|That's over 4% of national income, raising some big questions about whether Britain can finance this borrowing and whether it be well spent.
NEUT11|We sought to find out how investors in British government debt might react.
BEAR12|The Chancellor Sajid Javid says they'll run scared he was talking about labor, creating an economic crisis within months.
NEUT13|But on the financing question, the government bond market doesn't appear terrified.
BULL14|The UK government can borrow for 10 years at a cost of only nought .75% a little up from a month ago, but still extremely low.
NEUT15|We also talked to many people in the market.
NEUT16|The main view was that investors would be willing to finance Labour.
NEUT17|All the Tory plans very cheaply.
NEUT18|For example, Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at Blue Bay Asset Management, summed up the views saying there was a once in a generation opportunity for a big.
NEUT19|Fiscal expansion, but you shouldn't think that because bond investors are prepared to fund big spending.
BULL20|They think it's a good idea.
BEAR21|Many we spoke to thought pushing so much money out of the door so quickly would lead to waste and bad investments.
NEUT22|The bond market isn't full of vigilantes at the moment, ready to push politicians around.
NEUT23|They're happy to finance Labour's plans, even if they think the proposals won't work, and there's a simple reason why they believe.
NEUT24|Even if the plans are nuts.
BULL25|"They'll still be repaid with at least some interest."""
