BULL0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to my channel."
NEUT1|So today going to analyze Boeing stock.
BULL2|So we've seen Boeing gold through the two biggest crisis of its history.
NEUT3|OK, on the one hand we have the 737 Max issue.
NEUT4|On the other hand, we have the pandemic, so both of them happen at the same time in March.
NEUT5|So in March we didn't know the outcome.
NEUT6|The outcome of any of them.
NEUT7|So that gives us a lot of certainty about the bottom of the drop here, OK?
BEAR8|We can be pretty sure that Boeing reached the bottom here.
NEUT9|So what has the stock been doing after that?
BULL10|OK, so we've seen the stock recovering together with the markets.
BEAR11|So first stock has recovered 50% of this whole movement.
BULL12|OK, there it has found resistance in the 200 moving average, and we've seen this talk finding a resistance there in many different times.
NEUT13|OK, so this is a very good example of how technique analyzes works and helps us.
NEUT14|Identify resistance and support levels.
BULL15|Entry level *** IT levels.
BULL16|OK so important thing here after after the release of the vaccine, we've seen the stock jumping above the 200 moving average.
BEAR17|Reaching again, this same resistance level around the $235 OK, it went even a little bit above.
NEUT18|The stock has a important gap right here.
NEUT19|Apparently gap right here that is working as a resistance.
NEUT20|So what is important right now is that the stock after it drops in December until until early February it found a resistance right here.
BULL21|OK, in the 200 moving average again and it was also an important resistance.
BEAR22|We've seen the stock is struggling with this price.
NEUT23|Also in June and August, so it's very important that the stock is reacting right there.
BULL24|OK, so we're seeing.
BULL25|This dog is directing today's is going up as well, so it's very very likely we will see this talk attacking again.
NEUT26|The 200 and 4200 and $50 range.
NEUT27|OK, I'm from their next step would be to fill this gap right here.
NEUT28|OK, so this is not a fast stock.
BULL29|OK, we want to see this stock going back up to $400 in a few months.
BULL30|OK will take longer but we can be pretty sure that this stock has strength.
NEUT31|I'm actually right now.
NEUT32|It's very important to see how the charge technically is very well structured.
NEUT33|OK, we have the 200 moving average stand up.
BEAR34|We have the price moving above 200 moving average and these are very bullish signals.
BULL35|So expect to see the stock attacking the $240 range soon.
NEUT36|And let's see from there the stock is able to move to higher levels so supports to watch right now.
NEUT37|Let me just build few natural levels right here as well so.
NEUT38|First, we have the minimums of the end of January right here around the $192.00 OK, then 200 moving averages also in that $190.00 range.
NEUT39|And then the last level.
BEAR40|I wouldn't like it going to lose is the 61.5 natural $181.00.
NEUT41|So as long as the stock is able to keep the price above 200 moving average.
BEAR42|Or even not losing the 61.9 fever Nachi level, we can remain bullish on the stock in the short and medium term.
BULL43|OK, so thank you everybody for watching this video to like it.
