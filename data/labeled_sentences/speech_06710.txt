NEUT0|"""And here's what people want to know about."
BULL1|Right now, we're seeing some really great movement with AMC.
BULL2|Hopefully it continues into the actual market open, but you can see that we're up to $9.70 up three percent 3.6%, and it actually is moving up pretty nicely.
BEAR3|It did decrease down to $8.95, where you know people were getting worried.
BEAR4|I seen it, and you know, a lot of the market was actually going the wrong way.
BEAR5|Well, a lot of the stocks were going the wrong way, but AMC looks pretty good creating this nice W formation and actually following through with that W. Crossing over from the 200 DMA, the 50 moving average you can see that crossover indicating an uptrend and we're going to see that continue on the way up now up to $9.80.
BULL6|So hopefully we can see this continue today.
NEUT7|That's what I'm looking for.
NEUT8|These are unpredictable.
NEUT9|These stocks are unpredictable, so This is why I say hope.
NEUT10|Rather than I know and nobody ever knows any position to grow.
BULL11|So this looks really good.
NEUT12|"Can't wait to see how it plays out today."""
