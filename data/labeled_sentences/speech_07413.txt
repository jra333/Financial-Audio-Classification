BEAR0|"""Good morning was a much better session for U.S. markets last night, which are continuing to eat away at the heavy losses we've had so far in the month of August."
BULL1|We had the Dow Jones lifting 249 points or almost 1% the S&P 500 at one point 2%, but technology stocks really stood out, with the NASDAQ lifting most by about 1.35%.
NEUT2|Now.
BEAR3|Honestly though, there is a lack of substance in these improvements at the moment at all it takes is really a bad tweet or two from President Trump and also signs of a slowdown in the global economy.
BULL4|To potentially see markets pulling back but for the time being market seemed quite encouraged by signs of the Trump administration has signaled progress on trade negotiations with China.
BULL5|Also hopes potentially of more stimulus coming through globally with signs that central banks will keep shoring up their economies.
BULL6|So we had 28 of the 30 stocks that make up the Dow Jones lifting today, so quite widespread improvements really tech stocks like Microsoft, Cisco and also Apple up as much as 3% last night chipmakers, which tend to be quite sensitive to news on the US China Trade front.
BULL7|Also did well.
BULL8|AMD and a video up in the order of two to 2 1/2% and the banks which are also sensitive to moves in bond yields moved quite substantially, so Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Citigroup were up as 10 year bond yields in the US jumped up.
BULL9|Now oil producers like Exxon and Chevron seem to be helped by lift in the oil price, which was up in the order of 2% last night, partly on the bit more optimism, perhaps, but also the fact that there was a drone strike in Saudi Arabia as well on the company reporting front we had Estee Lauder.
BULL10|Lifting about 10% the fact that there's strong demand for its products around the Asia Pacific region seems to have seen the company lift its profit expectations for the year ahead.
BULL11|Now the Aussie market today seems set for a slight improvement.
BULL12|Spy futures up in the order of 15 points or 1/5 of 1% and this is after lifting in the order of 1%.
NEUT13|Just yesterday.
BEAR14|Mind you, we've had three straight weeks of losses and we're still down about 5% so far this month.
NEUT15|Now on the economic front, we've got the Reserve Bank Board minutes out today.
NEUT16|I've got the weekly consumer confidence.
NEUT17|And Commonwealth Bank's business sales index and a busy day for company profit results.
NEUT18|So the one that will probably receive most attention is BHP will also hit from here from Kogan SG Health Oil Search.
NEUT19|Sonic Healthcare, An 7 W media stock that could be a little bit of a wait in the text space.
NEUT20|At least his computer share its trading ex dividend.
NEUT21|Today it has a dividend yield around 3%, so it's paying out a dividend around $0.23 in the coming months.
NEUT22|Are resource stocks where we've got mixed leads.
BEAR23|At the moment the price of oil was up but we had iron ore and gold prices down.
BULL24|While BHP and Rio in London trade managed to lift quite strongly so wait and see how market reacts the Aussie dollar a little softer at 767.6 US.
NEUT25|"Enjoy the day."""
