NEUT0|"""Is skinny and a weekly top 50 welcome back is the 18th of March 2021, Thursday the 4th day of the week."
BULL1|We are number tree, Cardano, whitiker ADHD so for 8 millions BTC with really broken out of the consolidation.
BULL2|We were in a very nice consolidation over here consolidating and poem.
BULL3|We blasted off cumblast poop.
NEUT4|Anyway, the best thing that could happen for Ada is we consolidate around here and then put them come bus number 2 so it's just that we don't really see any clear.
NEUT5|Yeah, so you see, usually before things start spiking right, there's always a consolidation.
NEUT6|Every spike consolidations by right consolidation spike very likely.
NEUT7|There should be a consolidation first before we start spiking.
NEUT8|So this consolidation might take some time to build.
NEUT9|However, as long as you are above this, keep in mind we remain bias bullish.
NEUT10|For Cardano against BTC we don't see any clear tradeable patterns.
BEAR11|This was a very big fall.
NEUT12|They came in for a dog.
BULL13|We see that we need to rise close to the top and after that's correct, maybe get some sort of.
NEUT14|Symmetrical triangle.
NEUT15|And then boom, we blast off.
NEUT16|However, it is too early to tell because you you know come back all the way back down for Corono games PC with just not exactly sure what's happening right now.
NEUT17|So we are going to be very careful about going to a trade too soon for Ada against BTC.
NEUT18|Alright, let's move on, do it against USD T, But before that please Scuse video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about radar in documents.
NEUT19|Be looking for a regains USD.
BEAR20|We remain super crazy, bullish off or add against USD every reason.
NEUT21|79 X, which means that if we had thousand $1000 at the very bottom here, you would have $79,000 at the top.
BEAR22|Just fall from $1000.
NEUT23|Crazy, right?
NEUT24|This is how far Carrano has already gone.
BEAR25|My fear for Cardano is that if you were to take out the highs over here right, we form a new all time high, then very likely this will be a double bearish divergance higher high on the price, but a lower high under Mandy.
NEUT26|Right?
BEAR27|And a lower high under RSI.
BEAR28|So potentially things could start collapsing lower for Ada against USD, so you need to be very careful about going to a trade too soon for Ada feel like a deep correction is not too far away.
NEUT29|Even if you were to consolidate, it will be longer.
NEUT30|Even if you were to rise higher.
NEUT31|I have a strange feeling correction is not too far away so be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT32|For ADA I don't know if this is already with four right?
NEUT33|This would be a 12345.
BEAR34|And after that we could be dropping lower, right?
NEUT35|So be very very very careful about going to a tree too soon.
NEUT36|Moose such as this.
NEUT37|Yeah, there's always a price to pay for moves such as this, so be very careful about going to attract too soon for either.
NEUT38|Alright, I guess it from my area technical analysis.
BULL39|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL40|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT41|"I just see you in the next video."""
