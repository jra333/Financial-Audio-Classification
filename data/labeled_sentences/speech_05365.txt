BULL0|"""Please explain to us how China could go from contraction to expansion in one month."
NEUT1|OK, so I know the number about 50 right?
NEUT2|But this is a totally expected, you know.
NEUT3|PMI survey is amongst two months comparison right?
BULL4|So you know over 50 means the industry activity is improving somewhat from the February level right?
NEUT5|And then this shouldn't be surprising at all because in February the Chinese economy is actually in a full stop, so it doesn't really take much to rise from such a low base right?
NEUT6|So and I think to certain extent.
BEAR7|How about 50 as well expected, but I was a little bit disappointed.
NEUT8|Is only that the PMI is only about two to three points, about 50, which means the rebound of much activity from February is rather modest, right?
NEUT9|So part of that, I think, reflects the more gradual resumption of economic activity, especially in early part of March.
NEUT10|And then I also think that reflects a lot about the deteriorating global economic outlook as well as subdued.
NEUT11|Domestic demand is specially in the consumer space.
NEUT12|Right I just.
NEUT13|What will understand this from two other angles?
NEUT14|One is we just had the central bank adviser in China say they're not going to put out a growth target for this year.
NEUT15|That on the one hand, sends a message that they're not very clear in certain about how economic activity would pan out through the course of the next few quarters at a time when the March readers come in so positive, that's one.
BULL16|The other angle is the international trade angle, and we just had data come out of Japan, where industrial output climbed .4%.
BEAR17|Which is fine, but a Japanese official was quoted as saying the main reasons behind the slowdown of factory closures.
BEAR18|And output disruptions in China when the supply chain in and around the region is so disrupted.
NEUT19|How is China managing?
NEUT20|To put its house in order so quickly.
NEUT21|Yeah, I think I mean to certain extent.
NEUT22|I mean try and I used to have this.
NEUT23|You know, growth target around you know 5 to 6% that level.
NEUT24|I mean if they are I mean I think at this moment you are seeing significant.
NEUT25|You know drag on the economy, right?
BEAR26|Both from the global recession.
BEAR27|We are expecting a very deep global recession.
BULL28|You know in the first half of this year and then you know, I think the Chinese economy was also getting quite a big hit.
NEUT29|You know from this domestic outbreak, right?
BULL30|An you know many people were expecting AV shaped recovery.
BEAR31|I think they're gonna be disappointed because the negative shock on the domestic side is going to persist for a while and you are going to see more downbeat.
BEAR32|You know demand from the global side, so I think you know the downside risk is too much.
BEAR33|The policy maker they just cannot afford to come out too much stimulus package to bring the girls back to the previous target.
BEAR34|So I would say they probably are ready to accept a lower growth.
NEUT35|Separate down the road and to recognize that you know as long as we have some stability in the society, social stability and you know that's probably what the Chinese policymaker appears the most.
NEUT36|Or rather than just a gross number.
