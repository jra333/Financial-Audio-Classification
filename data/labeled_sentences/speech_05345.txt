BULL1|In today's NIO, stock analysis and predictions wine aisle stock is trading higher today.
NEUT2|Watch to the end to learn why the electric vehicle manufacturer is finishing Tuesday with a gain of 2.01% as of 11:00 AM Eastern Standard Time, resulting in the $40.13 price for the stock.
BULL3|NIO is trading higher today despite other electric vehicle stocks such as Tesla and index funds such as sand 500 and NASDAQ trading in the negative.
BULL4|Now, according to analysts, NIO is trading higher today due to its price being heavily underrated at this moment.
NEUT5|One famous Wall Street analyst explained the whole recent Nile situation.
NEUT6|So let's take a look at what he says the situation for.
NEUT7|Nile is simpler than it seems in the last few months we have had three main growth impulses.
NEUT8|As can be seen from the graph.
BEAR9|In accordance with Elliot theory, we then saw two main bearish impulses between one and the other.
BULL10|We had a rebound on the male 50.
BULL11|After the second impulse, we went back to testing him a 50 and for the moment it looks like stable support.
BULL12|We could therefore have completed the corrective cycle and be ready to restart.
BULL13|The confirmation of this possibility also comes from the fact that the support level coincides with Gans 21 growth radius, so I would say that support in the $35 thirty $7.00 area for the moment seems to be very solid and of outmost importance.
NEUT14|But be careful if this cycle has not closed, it is possible to go and test the Gan 31 growth radius before starting again.
NEUT15|Therefore in the area of $3234.00.
NEUT16|However, I consider this second hypothesis very unlikely.
BULL17|Another very important factor to note is that in the mid 50 has made an out in move from the Bollinger bands.
BULL18|However, there is a strong resistance in the $46.50 area, with NEMA 20 beating this level would mean returning strongly to the uptrend.
BULL19|The price for the moment continues to move in and increased channel that we have tested in recent days and which seems to hold up the correction.
BULL20|In my opinion, the long term target remains very high with the goal of a new one.
BULL21|One growth range test with the $79.85 area testing the long term.
NEUT22|Obviously with various up and down periods.
NEUT23|Basically.
BULL24|This analyst predicts Neo will finish higher in the coming weeks, so due to this we at 10 X stocks have decided to purchase 2X leverage margin calls today at $38.00.
NEUT25|Basically Neo, will it be a long term winner and make investors rich?
NEUT26|Will Neo skyrocket more?
BULL27|Only time can tell, but this definitely looks promising.
BULL28|Hold long and strong blue skies are coming.
BULL29|Thanks for watching.
