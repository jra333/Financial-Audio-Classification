NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Video information here.
NEUT2|We have the formal analysis and this time I'm not invested, but I will be invested.
NEUT3|General Mills so we have a value investor price to earnings ratio.
NEUT4|10.4 Anna forward price to earnings ratio of 11.5.
BEAR5|Now you want it to be in the average of a 20s, so therefore it's lower than that.
BULL6|So it's even better.
NEUT7|The lower is always better guys, but the problem is it is going up once it's forward.
NEUT8|So next year.
NEUT9|So that is something where you're like OK, why?
NEUT10|So anyways, moving on price to book ratio 3.58, the average is under 5, so that's really good price to sales ratio 1.39 average under 5 slots really good 1.92 Wo average under .5 it's almost four times where you want it to be at, so that's the issue right there.
BEAR11|But The thing is, this company purposely put themselves in debt because of the acquisition of Blue Buffalo.
BEAR12|The current top pet food brand threw them into debt.
NEUT13|I basically wrote so you get what I'm saying there.
NEUT14|I just want to jump to that just to explain why they're in so much debt so they purposely did this.
NEUT15|Knowing this and knowing how old the company is is very interesting, and it makes me alright.
NEUT16|I see what they're doing, like they're they're trying to scare people, but then.
NEUT17|When everyone comes funneling on back, it's going to be there.
NEUT18|Have some nice numbers like why would you purposely put yourself in debt like that anyways?
BEAR19|Revenue percentage market cap so for the growth investor revenue 16.1 billion, three point 8% year over year growth so very slow knowing that they had slow revenue growth.
NEUT20|They bought the top pet food brand guys.
NEUT21|It's General Mills they own over 100 pet food over 100 brands.
NEUT22|Sorry not pet food brands.
NEUT23|A market cap of 22.3 billion.
NEUT24|So I have to be continued because the earnings is this Wednesday, so I will make a quick video about just their earnings.
NEUT25|That'll be A to be continued.
NEUT26|Further information we have the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, the current top pet food brand threw them into debt just to make sure you guys are paying attention over 100 brands.
NEUT27|So I'm just going to name the ones that are US American.

NEUT43|Obviously totinos those are the pizza bites fruit by the foot in Nature Valley Progresso and then the Yoplait yogurts.
NEUT44|And there's so many more.
NEUT45|But those are all the ones that I knew the name of.
NEUT46|So I was like, OK, yeah?
NEUT47|I've like definitely like I like know what they are so.
NEUT48|Age old company at IPO in 1978, so it's four decades old guys.
NEUT49|Why would they purposely put themselves in debt?
NEUT50|It's just very interesting.
NEUT51|4.5% dividend yield.
NEUT52|So with all that being said, I'm putting $50 into this company next Thursday as well as $50 into Amazon.
NEUT53|This next video coming up will be on Amazon, so I already have had Amazon in the past and I still want it.
