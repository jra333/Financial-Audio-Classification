NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol BLPH."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link, so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day in this one, not only from the price action POV, but you look down here at the volume master volume on.
NEUT5|It's a lot of eyeballs on it going into next week, so let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price can say up there above the $15 mark.
NEUT7|Don't get me wrong with the price falls below 15.
NEUT8|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage step above that level.
BULL9|That would certainly be a massive sign of power going forward.
NEUT10|Taking a step back and look at all this from the overarching point of view, that is where the purple line here comes into play.
NEUT11|The 50.
NEUT12|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by this line here is going to move itself higher and higher, so a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT13|That right there, being defined as quote unquote, the move.
NEUT14|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as the land itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT15|The Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT16|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT17|Yeah, staying above 15 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT18|As long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart and 15 is also in those levels that a lot of people will be watching.
NEUT19|Both belongs in shorts, shorts are going to be wondering if the price works down there and breaks down through it.
BEAR20|You know not that the price is going to drop straight down into the abyss, but there's definitely some some room for a potential downside move.
BULL21|But as of now, $15 has done a good job holding strong and then as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT22|It's all about that resistance trendline right there, so keep a close eye on that.
BULL23|The price can work its way up there and get a good high volume break.
NEUT24|So the key dynamic there being a high volume break, you know that is where you gotta like the chances of having a good opportunity to at least get up to the $25 mark if not even higher than that.
NEUT25|So we'll see what happens with the next week.
NEUT26|But yeah, no doubt about it, crazy mover.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
