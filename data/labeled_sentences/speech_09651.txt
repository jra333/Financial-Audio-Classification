BULL1|Elrond blockchains recent addition of Carpathian Steak to its network, could prove helpful to its users and might even help give the Elron price or nudge to ascend higher.
BULL2|The Elron blockchain and its developers have been in the Vanguard for far too long, announcing major partnerships and developments.
NEUT3|As of March 21st, the team announced a new staking provider Carpathian Stake.
BULL4|From a popular mobile payments app to their hyper growth campaign, Elrond has grown and so has Elron tokens price.
NEUT5|However, this recent announcement puts a new spin on the staking game.
NEUT6|Usually staking has a list of requirements and hefty upfront token deposits that detur market participants from having skin.
NEUT7|In this game.
NEUT8|However, with Carpathian stake this is about to change.
BULL9|L Ron's co-founder, Lucien Minsoo stated Carpathian Stake is able to offer their customers full node ownership in a non custodial manner while abstracting away any kind of technical complexity.
BULL10|Additionally, the blog added that the gold holders have an opportunity to own one or more validator nodes without having to manage the underlying infrastructure.
BEAR11|L Ron Price has been producing higher highs and higher lows since February 22nd.
NEUT12|It's recent 25% crash between March 10th and 15th formed the second lower low drawing, a trendline along these swing points results in an ascending parallel channel formation.
BEAR13|This pattern has a bearish bias if a setups lower trendline is breached.
BEAR14|However, until Elrond price slices through the lower boundary, investors can expect another leg to the upside.
BULL15|If this were to happen, Elron needs to break past the immediate supply barrier at $145.00, coinciding with the 78.6% Fibbonaci retracement level.
BULL16|This move will establish a higher high and might provide the sidelined investors of reason to enter the market.
BULL17|In this case, Elron could climb 15% to tap the recent high at $166 or surge another 18% to hit the 127.2% Fibbonaci retracement level at $197.00.
BULL18|Supporting this bullish outlook is the buy signal generated from the Super Trend Indicator on March 20th.
BEAR19|Regardless, the upswing in Elron price action is solely dependent on a bounce from the lower trend line of the ascending parallel channel, around $130.
NEUT20|This level is critical since it is a confluence of the 61.8% Fib Annachi retracement level, the 206 hour simple moving average and the base of the technical formation.
BULL21|Only a massive spike in bearish pressure will be able to slice through it.
BEAR22|In such a case, the Elron price could slide 7% of the immediate demand barrier at $121 following a breakdown of this level, the crypto currency could drop another 7% to $112.00.
