NEUT0|"""Good afternoon, this is Pat Walker machine winners doing a video analysis on Arcimoto and I assume that's how you pronounced it."
NEUT1|Maybe it's our key mode?
NEUT2|Oh, what are the other?
NEUT3|But it's ticker symbol FUV we can stick with that too.
NEUT4|How's that sound?
NEUT5|And it's just going sideways.
NEUT6|Remember this though?
NEUT7|How do we build the foundations?
NEUT8|Leading groups help us in any plus rated group before it broke out.
BULL9|999% revenue growth.
BULL10|We either like great earnings and or great sales in top groups.
NEUT11|9995 composite rating.
BULL12|99 Relative strength rating.
NEUT13|When the stocks right here, OK, that's how you build a case and again it's a clean and simple chart pattern and what caught our eyes?
NEUT14|Well a the numbers be the group.
BULL15|See the chart rallies up pulls back, starts to pick up on a pickup in volume on the Daily Bar.
NEUT16|Would just say if it takes out these top said probably be a goodbye.
NEUT17|If it does it with volume advance at one bar.
NEUT18|Oh look at that looky there.
NEUT19|On this bar the stock did 3.5 million shares.
NEUT20|I'm rounding on his bar, 9 million.
NEUT21|Not quite triple, but a huge jump pushing through there and what we do.
NEUT22|We bought it that simple.
NEUT23|That simple now advance it all down bar big problems.
BEAR24|It's still above the pivot and the volume was less on this bar.
NEUT25|The volume was nine million shares.
NEUT26|I'm rounding by the way, on this bar was 4.6 just a hair over half, so there wasn't serious selling pressure, so we watch.
NEUT27|But know this we're not going to let this thing drop down where we're losing money, right?
BEAR28|Advancing comes right down near here, bounces off of it alright, but it did it on really low volume.
BULL29|See that volume very low so we're OK. We're alright advance it one bar.
NEUT30|And it does this lift off today and note the volume pick up today versus yesterday, and I'm making this video right now at about 12:30 in the afternoon.
NEUT31|We still have 2 1/2 hours to go.
NEUT32|But the key point is this.
BEAR33|The volume on this bar as it came down was low.
NEUT34|It was low, and that's a catalyst to stick.
NEUT35|So now what you're going to do?
NEUT36|Well, it's doing this today.
BULL37|Everything looks great.
NEUT38|We'll see if it continues anyway, I just wanted to go through and explain what we look at price and volume, but we always have constraints in there as far as great stocks in great groups.
BULL39|Anyway, I hope this helps.
NEUT40|Just kind of explain things.
NEUT41|Just step by step.
NEUT42|I love doing that.
NEUT43|Leave no stone unturned.
NEUT44|Let's be thorough and what's it do?
BULL45|It makes you that much better, and that's my goal.
