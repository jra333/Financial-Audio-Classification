NEUT0|"""Alright, so quickly I wanted to talk about Dramatica and what my plans are for the position."
NEUT1|So I have about 3000 shares of somatic.
NEUT2|As you know, I bought you know 1000 shares again yesterday, but you seen what it did yesterday or today in the morning in the premarket gap down a number of times all the way down to $1.11 cents to where it did end up stair stepping on the way up, which people were excited to see in the morning.
BEAR3|People got really upset in the in the Discord Group in the stream to people were asking me a ton about this position.
BULL4|But you see, it did flatten out, got to a high of 145.
NEUT5|Right now it's at 140.
NEUT6|Don't really know where it's going to finish.
NEUT7|I would imagine somewhere around that one 4141 Mark.
BULL8|And then we'll probably see some more increasing over the after hours market.
NEUT9|But I have faith in what somatic and do.
NEUT10|"My plans are really to sell it at 250 Mark, I know it can get to $3.00 or $5, but I want to take a $3000 profit at 2:50."""
