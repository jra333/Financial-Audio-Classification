NEUT0|"""Good evening and today we're looking at Amazon and these videos."
NEUT1|I like to just go over all any price Action News.
NEUT2|Do you like these kind of videos please?
NEUT3|Like and subscribe.
NEUT4|If you want some free money, there's a link down below for some free stocks with people actually like the real trading platform, I've messed with it a lot and it's actually pretty cool in terms of Amazon, it's really in the middle of this trading range that it's been trading in for.
NEUT5|Made really since July.
NEUT6|I honestly you know.
NEUT7|I think some of the rally like it didn't take part of this rally, mainly due to you know people pulling out of the money out of this stock to invest in other stocks.
NEUT8|Also.
NEUT9|On the flip side that.
NEUT10|No, maybe the thought of people using less Amazon is now they know the vaccine is, you know, more possibility in the near future.
NEUT11|I think we could potentially see more selling out of Amazon an investing in other stocks and his fat continues then I could see.
NEUT12|You know historically, at least for the recent if we do get a dip around here, you know.
NEUT13|Basically, 2950 is not a buying or not a bad spot to look at buying.
NEUT14|It's basically what 200 bucks lower than where it is right now and.
NEUT15|But like when I guess that's a different SUV to CIRM in terms of percent and where it's at now.
NEUT16|Yeah, I guess you save you know 6 1/2% so in terms if you bought there and it went up to where it was at.
NEUT17|Let's see.
NEUT18|It would be like.
NEUT19|You made 7% per say.
NEUT20|So.
NEUT21|But yeah, so I mean in the near term that would be my initial target.
NEUT22|If there is for some reason some massive selling in the market.
NEUT23|Then I would probably, you know, look back.
NEUT24|You know there's a good chunk of selling and we're already close to that 2950.
NEUT25|You could, potentially, you know by a little bit there, and if you wanted to add more to your position, then I would look at that around that 26.
BULL26|Range, but in general I still think Amazon is a long term company is a good investment.
BULL27|I know in previous videos I mentioned a bigger pullback and I still think we may see it.
NEUT28|But we'll have to wait and see.
NEUT29|I mean, ultimately it's you're never going to be perfect in terms of timing the market.
NEUT30|And if you do.
NEUT31|You know, it's really it's better to find stocks if you like.
NEUT32|Buy into him and let him ride.
NEUT33|Then as you get more money to invest, if one of them is undervalued, then you invested more into him.
NEUT34|And to me, that's sort of my goal is to try to find stocks that I like and then find the ideal point to maybe, you know, add some to my position, and then go from there.
NEUT35|Oh no, that that that sums up this video.
NEUT36|"If you have any other questions or anything please let me know."""
