NEUT0|"""Let's start with Boeing."
NEUT1|On Wednesday morning, the 737 Max is finally airborne.
BULL2|The orders are are well, they're trickling in.
BULL3|Let's leave it that way, but it's too soon to expect a great quarter because the airlines are still in survival mode.
NEUT4|That said, for months I've told you, the Chinese government is parsing every word from Joe Biden's team, and if the new administration lowers the temperature, China will respond with massive aircraft orders.
NEUT5|See, they actually need planes to tell right now, but I suspect it won't be long.
NEUT6|Abbott Labs reports they've been working **** ** COVID-19 testing, although they've yet to really mass produce the cheap at home tests that the FDA proved that we all really want right.
NEUT7|We want to test that we check every single day so that we don't go to work if we find out that were sick before we can.
NEUT8|In fact, AB is going to make his name, though this quarter with its blood sugar monitor, so I expect to beat raise after the clothes we hear from Apple, Facebook and Tesla.
NEUT9|Facebook app Fat you're fat.
BEAR10|OK, now I'm starting to feel like they're bunching up on purpose just to make my life difficult.
NEUT11|You can't focus when they report at the same time and Jimmy Chill likes to focus.
BULL12|I bet app will be in direct, but I think it would be incredibly upbeat about its entire product line, not just the the iPhone 12 which shows a remarkable pictures they're cleaning up thanks to the stay at home economy and the service revenue stream should keep growing to the one wild card.
BEAR13|Is currency apples left so much money on the table because of the strong dollar, but the greenback got much weaker this quarter.
NEUT14|I think that is going to matter.
NEUT15|You don't even realize it, but that's gonna be a major change.
BULL16|I'm expecting an amazing quarter from Facebook.
NEUT17|I'm probably the only one who is, but given the fact that so many small and medium sized businesses rely on them for advertising, I think it's.
NEUT18|I think it's gonna be the real deal if management says anything about monetizing their other businesses.
NEUT19|I think the stock can challenge you.
BULL20|Highs.
NEUT21|They tend not to.
NEUT22|I don't mind there 'cause it's got a little political fight.
NEUT23|As for Tesla, their conference calls used to be, it was top tier entertainment.
NEUT24|Fallon is Kimmels were Kimmel.
NEUT25|But if you must doesn't get the two border you're going to hear some fantastic commentary to go along with fantastic numbers.
BULL26|We know Tesla is doing well because they give us so much information each month.
NEUT27|We can only piece it together.
