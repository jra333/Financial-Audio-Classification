BULL1|The iota price is defying gravity even as other crypto currencies are in the red, the token has jumped by more than 10% in the past 24 hours, making it the best performing digital currency.
BEAR2|Other currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano have declined by more than 6%.
NEUT3|What is iota?
NEUT4|Iota is a blockchain company that focuses on the Internet of Things, which is a fast growing industry that helps machines communicate with the Internet.
NEUT5|It uses the Tangle network that helps to record the exchange of data and value.
NEUT6|The IOTA token is the native currency that is used in the platform.
BULL7|In the past few months, the iota price has been in a strong upward trend.
BULL8|It has risen by about 2200% from its lowest level last year.
NEUT9|373% of these gains have happened this year.
NEUT10|Why Iota is rising?
BULL11|The price is rising after the company released the Smart Contracts protocol ahead of its core decide rollout in a statement yesterday, the Iota Foundation said that it was accelerating the updates to the Tangle Network that will make it easier for developers to build on the network, a spokesperson said.
NEUT12|The vision of ISC P is to run in production on the fully decentralized IOTA protocol without a coordinator.
BULL13|That is what we are building for with go shimmer, and we're very confident that we will be able to achieve that this year.
BULL14|In the past we see the price of digital currencies rally before a major upgrade.
NEUT15|This explains why the price is rallying today.
BEAR16|The iota price has been in a narrow range recently.
NEUT17|In fact, it was forming an ascending triangle pattern that is shown in red.
BEAR18|It is also moved slightly above the 15.
NEUT19|In 25.
NEUT20|Moving averages.
BEAR21|Also, the price is 16% below the all time highs of 1.5990 dollars.
BULL22|Therefore, I suspect that the price will continue rising as Bulls target this price.
BULL23|Still, Bulls will need to defend the important resistance at 1.500.
BEAR24|First, however, a decline below 1.2700, which is the previous top of the triangle, will invalidate this trend.
