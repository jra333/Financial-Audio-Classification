NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Pat O'Hare chief market analyst for briefing.com."
NEUT1|Today is Friday, February 29th.
BULL2|Dell can do better.
BEAR3|The company knows it and so does the market where judgment has been cast in the form of a lower stock price following Dell's fiscal fourth quarter report.
BEAR4|The disappointment over Dells latest results revolves around its inability to live up to Wall Street's expectations and some cautious guidance for the near term that was pinned on Dell's ongoing restructuring costs.
BEAR5|And the potential for more conservative spending by its customers at the same time the market is cognizant that Dells results continue to pale in comparison to those of rival Hewlett-Packard.
BULL6|Which, among other things, topped expectations for its fiscal first quarter and raised guidance for its fiscal year.
BULL7|For Dell revenue increased 10% in the fourth quarter to $15.99 billion.
BEAR8|Yet its net earnings declined 6% to $679 million, or $0.31 per share.
NEUT9|The latter includes multiple items that went excluded translate to a non gap profit of $0.34 per share.
NEUT10|Analysts had been expecting a profit of $0.36 per share.
BULL11|Like many other companies, Dell reap the benefits of a strong international business sales outside the US Rep 16% in the fourth quarter, led by 36% growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China, otherwise known as the BRIC countries.
BULL12|For fiscal 2008, Dell's revenues increased 6% to $61.1 billion, while net earnings increased 14% to $2.95 billion or dollar thirty one per share, up from $1.14 for fiscal 2007.
NEUT13|In the most telling line in the company's press release, Michael Dell conceded the company still has much work to do in terms of improve.
BULL14|And its cost, structure, and competitiveness, the encouraging consideration there is that there is still plenty of room for improvement.
BEAR15|To wit, Dell's operating margin rate of 5.6% for fiscal 2008 is approximately 300 basis points below where it was at the end of fiscal 2005.
BEAR16|Increased competition from the resurgent HP as well as from companies like IBM and Apple will make the turn around process all the more challenging, particularly in an environment where concerns abound about a slowdown in its pending.
NEUT17|Fortunately, Dell has the right person at the helm, its namesake, founder to steer the company's turn around process.
BEAR18|It isn't going to happen overnight, so investors are going to need to have patience with the stock, which continues to underperform.
NEUT19|We continue to hold the stock if you own it, but would hold off.
NEUT20|New positions for now I'm Pat O'Hare for briefing.com.
BULL21|"Thanks for listening."""
