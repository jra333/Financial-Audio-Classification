BULL0|"""3% growth."
NEUT1|Is this a sustainable pace?
NEUT2|Could we get back there with the right policy mix?
NEUT3|No, we could get there if we get very very lucky if some wonderful technology comes along or you know something productivity surges for reasons that we don't understand.
NEUT4|But no, there's nothing in policy that would raise the growth rate.
NEUT5|Nobody you know I could, you could make me total dictator and do everything I believe would work and it still wouldn't get you up by more than a few tenths of a percentage point.
NEUT6|So you saying that the US economy is already added?
NEUT7|Speed limit pretty close.
BEAR8|I mean, we're not quite at full employment, but probably pretty close.
NEUT9|Look at things like quit rates, wage rates if there are suggesting economy pretty close to capacity and the underlying you know the sustainable pace of growth does not look like it's above 2% between aging population, labor force participation, kind of stagnating.
NEUT10|There's just no way to see how you can get that kind of growth unless you really just.
NEUT11|It just doesn't make sense as a story, and you mentioned aging population.
BEAR12|I know that you've noted that demographics alone would limit growth 2 by 1 percentage point lower than what we had.
NEUT13|Under President Reagan, that's right.
NEUT14|Remember we back in the in the 80s.
NEUT15|We were still, you know, baby boomers were still entering the workforce.
BEAR16|Now they're leaving and we also have.
NEUT17|We had a surge of women into the workforce which hit peak, so there's no way that yeah, we, we are an aging society.
BEAR18|We're not quite Japan where they work in each population is shrinking rapidly, but we're growing much more slowly than it was.
BEAR19|So you kind of expect lower growth.
NEUT20|Unless there's a productivity miracle and nobody knows how to make those happen.
NEUT21|Let's go back to the idea of a big infrastructure spending boom.
NEUT22|For many years long, after the intensity of the slump, you and others had called for that is there a putting aside the cyclical question of whether we're at full employment now, does it make sense to do that from a long term productivity standpoint?
BULL23|In other words, spend a lot of money, because if we have more modern airports and roads and telecom systems, and everything that will raise our productivity and louser, well, yeah, it's actually.
NEUT24|I'd say there are three reasons.
BEAR25|One, we are actually starved for infrastructure.
BULL26|We could there clearly a lot of productive public investments to be made.
NEUT27|The second thing is, despite the fact that interest rates are going up a bit, there still incredibly low.
NEUT28|So if now is not a time to borrow in is, and the third thing is, although we seem to be close to full employment, we don't.
BULL29|We could use a little cushion there.
BULL30|A little bit of stimulus would still be helpful, even though we're no longer in a deep slump.
NEUT31|I have a chart here that kind of shows how little infrastructure spending we're getting just sort of looking at total spending on non defense government investment as a share of GDP.
NEUT32|So is there an opportunity for?
NEUT33|The crude nights in the Trumpists to coalesce around a unified policy you might have thought there was, but you notice he didn't say.
NEUT34|Let's spend a trillion dollars, he said.
NEUT35|Let's have a plan, public private that will cause so yeah.
NEUT36|"I mean, if he actually provided a clean, let's spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure that would be very hard for people like me not to be for it, but he isn't."""
