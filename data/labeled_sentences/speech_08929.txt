NEUT0|"""A final question."
NEUT1|If you can't, if you couldn't own or buy Bitcoin, what other digital asset would you buy?
NEUT2|Yeah, it's great question.
NEUT3|It would probably be digitized traditional assets, right or tokenized, traditional assets.
NEUT4|I don't think that traditional assets are going to go away.
NEUT5|What we're going to see is of similar transition from what we saw in what I call it.
NEUT6|The analog age of security.
NEUT7|So stocks used to be physical pieces of paper that we would buy and sell and transact.
NEUT8|Wait, so you wouldn't buy XLP or you wouldn't buy TRX?
NEUT9|Why?
NEUT10|Because I ultimately don't think that they have the same value that these other assets have right?
NEUT11|My belief or value argument.
NEUT12|My belief is that stocks what gives them value.
NEUT13|Right again, GDP, revenue, profits, etc.
NEUT14|All the stream of income from a company that's doing something with data assets, right, etc.
NEUT15|18 something.
NEUT16|So everything that makes those valuable that doesn't change.
NEUT17|You're just changing the technology form factor of which you will buy that asset.
NEUT18|So you won't buy that electronic cusip anymore.
NEUT19|You'll now by that same stock or just be a digitizer, tokenize stock.
NEUT20|I actually like those assets.
NEUT21|They're not bad assets and I don't think that Bitcoin competes with those assets.
NEUT22|What Bitcoin competes with very specifically other currencies right?
NEUT23|In those currencies, even if they change their technology.
NEUT24|I think the monetary policy is bad because monetary policy is superior, but all of these other assets that are quote unquote utility tokens, either their utility in terms of they give you access to something so they're not really an investment.
NEUT25|It's more of I get utility or some good or service in exchange.
NEUT26|So you're separating.
NEUT27|I'll use X LP's example simply because I've interviewed recently.
NEUT28|You see no connection between what Ripple is trying to achieve with their network and the value of XRP, yes, so and I think Brad would would say this, right?
NEUT29|Is rippled.
NEUT30|The software company is different than SRP.
BEAR31|The token and I think that part of the problem is that retail investors have believed that by buying XRP they have exposure to financial performance Ripple.
NEUT32|That's obviously not true, and then it will be a security policy argument.
NEUT33|I won't even go there, right?
NEUT34|But on top of that, what ends up happening is if Ripple is successful, that does not necessarily mean that SRP ends up being successful, right?
BULL35|And so also, that means that SRP could go up in value.
BEAR36|An ripple could go out of business, right?
NEUT37|Speculators could drive the price, etc.
NEUT38|So when you get this disjoint meant between SRP and Ripple?
NEUT39|Or other assets that have a similar mechanism.
NEUT40|What ends up happening is I, as a investor, actually want to own equity in the software company 'cause there's profits.
NEUT41|There's assets.
NEUT42|There's all the revenues, etc.
NEUT43|"I don't want to own the asset that May or may not be there in the future and doesn't have any underlying utility or value driver that I can point to and say I have confidence that's going to last bitcoins different 'cause it's backed by the most secure computing network in the world."""
