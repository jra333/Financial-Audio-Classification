BULL0|"""Welcome back everyone."
NEUT1|It's Wednesday, October 9th and today will be looking at what's happening in WTI oil futures before trade talks start this Thursday.
BULL2|So zooming into the chart, we can see that the market is well supported by the 50.70 level, which means that 23.6% fibo Nachi over the download from 76.87 to 42.53 are technically at these bots on could come back into view in the short term as the weakness in the RSI and the magazines suggest that the Bears bias is still in play.
BEAR3|If we manage to break these line and therefore exit this range bound, trading the negative sentiment would would stretch to the medium term picture as well.
BEAR4|With a 49.50 level probably providing initial support on the way down while lower the cell of quote next to near 47 and before all attention turns to the 1 1/2 year low of 42.53 where any violation would put the market back on a downtrend.
BULL5|On the upside, the price could turn up to meet.
NEUT6|The 50%, the 38.2% he will not show 55.73 and then the 50% fibo or 59.81.
BULL7|Although only a rally above the 63.84 and 64.70 area would limit downside pressures.
BULL8|Clearing that up at 66.57 as well other bullish action could gain extra momentum, are resuming confidence on this upward move in pushing resistance towards the 70 level.
NEUT9|So that's all from me.
NEUT10|Thank you for watching.
BULL11|"Have a great day."""
