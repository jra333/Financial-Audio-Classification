NEUT0|"""How will you stabilize the economy?"
BEAR1|Windows problems.
NEUT2|OK, that's another thing.
NEUT3|I think the whole idea of that when the economy starts to crumble or something happens where we need to spur growth.
NEUT4|Let's print this.
NEUT5|Let's change interest rates like.
BEAR6|It feels like a manipulation of the free market, frankly, and I think a lot like we bailed out GM.
NEUT7|Was that a good idea?
NEUT8|I don't know like their business ***** now like they didn't invest in electric cars like we every company bailout like doesn't seem to be doing great.
NEUT9|You know, like I don't like this idea that oh if you're an airline and you go bankrupt 'cause times were tough, we're going to bail you out.
NEUT10|It's like no you should go bankrupt and then all future airlines will have a better capital reserve.
NEUT11|So I'm I'm not a big.
NEUT12|I'm a huge proponent in free markets and I've actually been even bigger than this video I made along time ago.
NEUT13|Was the institutional dissent.
NEUT14|Dis and I can't even say this because it's so complex that that the way they spread information to institutional investors on Wall Street like I don't know if you know this, but like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley like after a conference call of a big public company will get to call the CEO and like have their own private conference call and getting their own private tour of the factory and get all this juicy details that nobody else gets.
NEUT15|And then they put that in a report to their clients.
NEUT16|First, they let their big clients trade it the entire way.
NEUT17|Wall Street works.
NEUT18|It's the institutionalization.
NEUT19|Of insider information dissemination, I think that's what my terms but basically like.
NEUT20|They've institutionalized the way they spread inside information by letting these analysts get access exclusive access to the company.
NEUT21|That's total BS, which is why I love Tesla because they change that paradigm.
NEUT22|They do these private investor tours which every company does, but they let me go on that tour and they let me talk about it to all of you and they let me go to the Giga factory and then talk about it.
NEUT23|All of you to spread it to the public because it's like yo, I'm like yo, why are you letting like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs like?
NEUT24|Get this private tour and like all the homies who love Tesla by Tesla's Watchtower, YouTube videos don't get to know that like that's wack.
NEUT25|But that's how literally the entire industry works.
NEUT26|And so it really like like.
NEUT27|Yeah, and so I don't know.
NEUT28|I the idea that free markets and the stock market is fair and there's like equal information is just totally wrong, so I don't like to pretend that that's the case and that's why I'm just a bigger believer in sort of this decentralized markets thesis, which I think is going to be really powerful, and I think the reality of the situation is the winner in all of This Is Us is that the consumer you can buy Bitcoin today, you can access it like it's decentralized.
NEUT29|Nobody can stop you.
NEUT30|There's no holding times there's no person at the bank to tell you.
NEUT31|You can't open your account like this is truly ubiquitous and decentralized, and so.
NEUT32|"I think that's really interesting."""
