NEUT0|"""But guys to return back to earnings this morning and move from Amazon to Alphabet."
BULL1|I think it's worth mentioning 'cause shares of Alphabet are going to be up.
NEUT2|Seeing it right now significantly angim, you know.
NEUT3|Looking at a note here from our friends over at Moffett Nathanson, who you follow closely as well as you can see $132 rise in that stock, almost 7% premarket right now.
NEUT4|And they're just talking about how the fact that Google keeps or Alphabet keeps giving us more and more information.
BULL5|On different areas of its business, which at least in their opinion at Moffett Nathanson, is shining a closer light on the fact that the core business is actually growing more quickly than might have been anticipated.
BULL6|Operating profits up 11% in the COVID-19 pandemic impacted 2020 after mid teens growth in 19, and even with no assigned value for other bets.
BULL7|Google Cloud if you back out around 155 billion of expected cash, you get 25% growth in services operating income this year.
NEUT8|It's trading at 23 times, hence they say the stock is cheap.
BULL9|I immediately sent Michael Nathanson an email saying, Can you believe the transition Ruth Porat doing some fantastic work CFO on the conference call?
NEUT10|There was a time, gave it this might be Disney.
NEUT11|All we ever used to talk about was declining.
NEUT12|ESPN used to talk about declining how much it costs, how much they made on a click.
NEUT13|This was about YouTube, YouTube dominance.
NEUT14|Finally realizing maybe they have something bigger than broadcast.
NEUT15|What's taking so long?
NEUT16|And then what Thomas Curry and is done with the cloud.
NEUT17|Now it's interesting David.
NEUT18|They're not making any money to cloud.
NEUT19|They are committed to the cloud.
NEUT20|I think they saw what Saudi and Adela did with Azure.
NEUT21|Obviously they sold any jazz he did but with with Amazon Web Services.
NEUT22|So that story the story of YouTube and the story of Google Cloud Thomas Current David that was the narrative they chose.
NEUT23|I'm forgetting about how much money they make per click.
NEUT24|I am thinking about what they're going to make in Google Cloud right?
NEUT25|An which will be interesting and is certainly worthy of your attention.
NEUT26|But you know, Jim, I can't help coming back to.
BULL27|My focus, which has always been on media and digital advertising, has incredible momentum.
NEUT28|We saw the Facebook numbers, but we've now seen alphabets numbers.
NEUT29|And you do have to wonder back to the GameStop scenario.
BULL30|Shares of Viacom shares some of the more traditional sellers of advertising have been up dramatically, but the momentum clearly seems to be on the digital side of this business.
NEUT31|Yeah David, we had an Asian Bush on this morning in the golf course.
NEUT32|Have some commercials in Super Bowl but I think that what's going to happen.
BEAR33|The next thing in Europe is the ad prices are going to go down.
NEUT34|Why?
NEUT35|Because you can reach the right people.
NEUT36|The people who want to watch when it comes to Google they can watch it all the time.
NEUT37|They went because You Tube is there forever.
NEUT38|The billions of the numbers of users you tuber staggering quarrel.
NEUT39|It's a passing the guard Ruth Porat did not want to rub it in people's faces, but there's no doubt about it.
BEAR40|Rates are coming down for traditional advertising.
