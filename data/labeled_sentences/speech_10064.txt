BEAR0|"""So new investors are facing the bubble."
NEUT1|Hello guys, welcome back to the channel and this is your daily Neo stock NEWS UPDATE.
NEUT2|Now the Chinese electric vehicle maker, Neo it's way different from Tesla as far as progress.
NEUT3|But recently investors have been treating this talk as though it is at the levels of Tesla.
BULL4|No, she has often or have been a 10 bagger gaming 1227% in value through November 24, but of course the gains have come since the government of China announced it was handing the firm Lifeline Tineo to state owned Jay AC Motors.
NEUT5|Now, speculators, however, have said no to this skepticism, since it has been speculated that that the Chinese government is involved in pumping up NEO stock in October.
BULL6|But of course, so far Neo shares are up 84%.
BULL7|Now, so far China is pushing Neo as the high end of its electric vehicle revolution as a Tesla replacement.
BULL8|And of course, Tesla's third quarter report said that China could be the biggest market for its Model 3 sedan.
BEAR9|And this has investors ignoring news that quarter numbers.
NEUT10|But of course these showed deliveries of just 12,206 cars and gross margins of 13% on a 666 million.
BULL11|Dollar revenue but of course bulls are betting that JC can copy Tesla's Tech and all its cells will go to NEO, but if that's the case, or someone might argue why is Tesla up nearly 500% this year?
NEUT12|But of course, at its November 24 opening price of $57.60, Neo had a market cap of over $75 billion on what are expected to be 7.5 billion of sales this year.
BULL13|And that's actually cheaper than Tesla, whose market cap of $484 billion is powered by a 24 billion in sales.
NEUT14|O'Neill stock, in other words, is being priced like a mini Tesla.
BULL15|And of course investors expect the Chinese government to make it a serious Tesla competitor.
NEUT16|But if Neo is a government controlled entity, why do they think that Western investors are going to get the benefit now?
BEAR17|Any stock selling for more than 10 times revenue is going to be volatile.
NEUT18|Of course, NEO stock is no exception.
BEAR19|And shares were heat briefly earlier this month when Sightron research say put out a bearish report on the stock.
BEAR20|And of course Andrew, left, of Citron, noted that Tesla repeatedly cut its prices in China to maintain the share of the market.
NEUT21|He also questioned whether Neo can compete profitably, and of course you're not buying a company or its prospects with Neo.
NEUT22|He actually said you're buying 3 letters that move on a screen.
NEUT23|But of course, what we're seeing is an electric vehicle bubble, and it's just like previous bubbles in Bitcoin marijuana, and of course, novel coronavirus vaccines.
NEUT24|And of course bulls.
BULL25|We respond that Bitcoin is bubbling again, and that vaccine and that vaccine winners like Madonna are holding their gains, and that Neo now trade above where it was when Cytron said cell.
NEUT26|"And that's just the reality of it."""
