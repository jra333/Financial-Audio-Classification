BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
NEUT2|This is gonna be a short and sweet straightforward video.
NEUT3|We're waiting for earnings tomorrow on some of our favorite stocks.
NEUT4|We have Apple, Tesla, Facebook reporting.
BULL5|After close today we have AMD and GameStop is still rallying.
NEUT6|We've been talking about this before in the $30 mark.
NEUT7|We said $50 is super close to half dollar Mark and it did break out that day.
BULL8|Hit towards the 75.
NEUT9|Once there was a 75 on Friday we said can we see 100?
NEUT10|Which is the next whole dollar mark?
BULL11|And yes indeed we were already up in the one 40s premarket.
NEUT12|Today it was very slow on in the morning and then after a couple halls.
BULL13|Of course the stock managed to break out.
BULL14|We are nearing one 50s again.
NEUT15|That half dollar mark can.
BULL16|We hit 200.
NEUT17|My personal opinion.
BEAR18|The short interest on the stock is really, really high.
NEUT19|It's around 150%.
NEUT20|I do think we can see 200 plus.
NEUT21|I think this is just the beginning of an epic move that's going to go down in the history books and I'm all here for it.
NEUT22|I love it.
NEUT23|I love day trading it.
NEUT24|Of course I bought right now on this dip.
NEUT25|I gotta halted again.
NEUT26|Same thing yesterday I bought another halted.
NEUT27|It seems like every little pullback we get a halt.
BULL28|Not the biggest profit but overall on the day we did pretty well.
NEUT29|514.
BULL30|We have Tesla bringing in the majority of the profit.
NEUT31|We sold some of our Coca Cola shares which is going to our plan accordingly.
NEUT32|So little bit early.
BULL33|Of course every time I sell the stock continues to rally up.
NEUT34|On the one hour it is still managing to break out, so I'm going to write the 20 shares on other stock we sold today.
NEUT35|Took some profits, was empty because we were waiting and anticipating a pullback in which we did get a pullback to 439 were nearing the $5 mark, not missing out on a lot of things, but I'll look into rebind this one on another.
NEUT36|Dip, one that we missed was IBM.
NEUT37|We've been talking about this one, being oversold, the same play here we were taught the same play over sold under the email in the four hour one hour and they break out.
NEUT38|Seems like I missed it could.
BULL39|Possibly pushed to 123.
BULL40|I don't know if we could possibly squeeze some profit here tomorrow, but I'll definitely be looking to rebuy if we near the one 20s for some reason.
NEUT41|My alerts didn't go off this morning.
NEUT42|I think probably because we didn't even break down under ask for Tesla earnings tomorrow guys, so be very careful.
NEUT43|Trading it.
NEUT44|Probably going to size down a little bit.
BULL45|We did manage to retest the 893 super close to the $900 mark, but if we differ on eight 70s I'll be buying right there, which was yesterday's midday support.
BEAR46|As you can see here, we're kind of pulling back ask for a pullback.
NEUT47|I think there might be a little sell off right now.
NEUT48|It's 1252.
NEUT49|There's like 8 minutes left the market open tomorrow closes.
NEUT50|I think there can be a little sell off headed into the clothes, with traders anticipating earnings and not wanting to swing, so I don't hold the earnings.
NEUT51|I played the momentum.
NEUT52|I played the hype.
BULL53|We've been expecting a pop on Tesla.
NEUT54|We did not get that for the entire week last week, but we had that move yesterday which was similar to Apple's earnings.
BEAR55|Running up that it's hard as you can see here 30 minutes, so that's pretty much it.
NEUT56|Still waiting for more news on the new vaccine.
NEUT57|And now we have the new variants that we've been talking about making headlines to watch.
BEAR58|That Civ stock is pretty much dead.
NEUT59|Not a lot of movement still hanging around the 24th.
BULL60|Still better than trading above.
NEUT61|Around the 19 level, so it still has a pretty decent support, but this isn't a catalyst stock.
NEUT62|Any little news, any little headline?
BEAR63|Any little rumor is going to definitely move the stocks or storm watch this AMC talked about that actually taking square off my watchlist and Twitter.
BEAR64|I think we've already missed the train on this one, so that's pretty much it.
NEUT65|"Super Short and sweet because for helpful we would like subscribe to the channel and I'll see you guys tomorrow for another crazy trading day ticker."""
