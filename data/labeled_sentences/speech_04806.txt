NEUT1|Check out my sponsor Jeet away the links down below in the description and use the code.
BULL2|Worked free for 3% cash back.
NEUT3|What is up guys burgers here and tell my presence for the next marquee matchups.
NEUT4|If you guys Win Choice video through please Smash Lab on down below so this will be one African Cup Nations game, one FA Cup game then two League games.
NEUT5|So for the African Cup of Nations game I'm thinking Cameron versus Senegal but I'm not 100% sure so completely up to which African combinations can you invest in.
NEUT6|But if you do go Cameron versus Senegal, one recommend doing.
NEUT7|But the quality is gold.
NEUT8|Then put senecal in the search is here and then set the Max price of 300 and do the no risk methods so you can't lose coins in the Mail what just go along here and lots of 300 coin bids down.
NEUT9|Looks like someone already for the first bunch there, but if you just go along you'll find quite a few that can put Freon coin bids on and will pick up most of them.
NEUT10|So DEF recommend doing that for the FA Cup game.
NEUT11|I'm going with Derby versus Lester for this one so it won't recommend doing is investing the Derby player whose goal concerning 1 gold player in the game so Derby and Search gorgeous here.
NEUT12|Vertical this one guy at the second as well.
NEUT13|You can pick him up about 400 coins.
NEUT14|Forbidden fruit by now he is around 500 as you saw for the first one on this page.
NEUT15|I think it was a second ago.
NEUT16|So yeah, 500 just there.
NEUT17|So at the second is quite cheap and he doesn't really have a ton of cards in the market as well.
BULL18|So it could be a pretty good investment if that game is picked for the next match.
NEUT19|This one is a championship game so Brian versus Newcastle first place first second.
BEAR20|So for Brian there are going to be the bad team at the two to invest in as their only got 2 gold players in the game.
NEUT21|So they got these two.
NEUT22|Just hear the Belgian guy and the French guy.
NEUT23|At the moment I'm trying to pick you up at 400 coins as fruit by nails.
BULL24|Now going for 500 and 2nd so could be some good investments as I can see them going up to potentially 1.5 K 2K roughly if they are required.
NEUT25|So yeah, different events and Brian players for Newcastle.
BEAR26|They got quite a few gold players and that means we probably won't go up as much as they could be.
BULL27|Good to invest in the silk so they're probably cheaper to pick up compared to the Brighton players.
NEUT28|So as you can see here.
NEUT29|Absolute ton applies that got have gold.
NEUT30|One player who actually could be pretty good to invest in.
NEUT31|Actually think Matt is one of the guys you can do with the no risk tricks.
NEUT32|So this guy just here fits into the Newcastle game also fits into the cenacle game, so potentially could be a really good investment for the next match.
NEUT33|This one is in France, so there's actually two games have a chance being picked.
NEUT34|I've gone with Leon versus Lil but PSG versus Monaco also has a chance, but fully on first level one recommend doing go along to little just here and do the no risk method.
BULL35|As it works pretty well, if Lil at 2nd and once can actually they got a single player didn't actually realize that, so could be a pretty good investment.
NEUT36|Like if you pick up him from Lil and then also the other guy from Newcastle effect two different games for the next match and also the final match of this video or we've got one in the Italian League.
NEUT37|So we've got Napoli verse.
NEUT38|This team just here and I think the no risk method works these two as well.
NEUT39|So this week really don't really need to risk like ton of coins by the same time for this game and also the game in the.
NEUT40|League One match.
NEUT41|I don't think the players go up that much, but it really depends the requirements then for the other games.
NEUT42|The African Cup nations game.
NEUT43|I don't think the players were ton if Derby versus Lester's pics.
NEUT44|I can see the Dolly play again up to 1.5 K 2K potentially then if reversed Newcastle picked the two Brian players can see them going up 1.5 K 2K but both in games.
NEUT45|They would need a rating requirement for that to actually happen.
NEUT46|So the best investments this week would be the two Brian players and Adobe player as they got the most potential to go up.
NEUT47|So we wait for this video as well now so see I should be triggered some hope you enjoy this video.
NEUT48|"And if you have places like."""
