NEUT0|"""List OK."
NEUT1|I'm going to talk about Netflix right now, so let's add another stream marker over here.
BEAR2|N. Netflix 1.7% as Morgan Stanley racist target on tailwinds.
BULL3|Mot Netflix is up one point 7% premarket.
BULL4|This came out on 9:29 AM after today's price target increased from Morgan Stanley, which expects tailwinds to keep up for the streaming leader.
BULL5|There are short and long term benefits from the pandemic spur changes.
BULL6|Analyst Benjamin Swim born rights in can expect increasing an outsized returns from his scale and the size of its content investments, Meanwhile, is competitive mode is perhaps deeper than ever and the company can draw substantial value from pricing power, he says Netflix is widely expected to implement a US price increase in the spring.
NEUT7|Morgan Stanley raises target to 630 from 600.
BULL8|Implying 16% upside.
NEUT9|With that said, Morgan Stanley, we're going to review Netflix right now and see your target and you're going to see where was our entry for Netflix originally?
NEUT10|And then you're going to see where Netflix.
NEUT11|Actually was an opportunity so Netflix on the weekly closing bearish looking pretty bearish to me right now, but don't mind at all because now we have a target from this individual which basically they're raising it from 600 to 630 OK.
NEUT12|So basically they're just changing a little bit, not a lot.
NEUT13|And boom.
NEUT14|Morgan Stanley, another one who's bullish on Netflix because they know they understand the value of daily active users.
NEUT15|You know, daily active users is very important, but with this bearish candle, higher highs, higher lows, still bearish, not in an oversold area for the weekly daily.
NEUT16|I wouldn't mind seeing the daily go over here to this 500.
BULL17|$3026 or even over here to $506.00 is being quite quite a right from Netflix, like we capitalize on the opportunity over here at 491.
NEUT18|We're just managing the investment and not only that, guys, that's not my original entry.
NEUT19|We've been talking about Netflix since, wow.
NEUT20|Since when was it?
NEUT21|I believe he was like 200.
NEUT22|Anne 40s over here.
NEUT23|I still remember here.
NEUT24|See he says entry?
NEUT25|Yeah, he's he's like he's there guys.
NEUT26|Netflix over there kicking booty.
NEUT27|I wouldn't mind seeing it go down.
BULL28|It will be a great opportunity now Netflix will have direct competition with net with Disney which is something that I don't know why it took so long.
NEUT29|I thought Disney was going to be doing it first but whatever Netflix was the one that created the path and I think Disney is going to create that.
NEUT30|Yellow brick road.
NEUT31|I don't know is that how you say chewy.
NEUT32|OK, sure, let's go ahead and move to Twitter.
NEUT33|I know you've been watching your Twitter chewy.
