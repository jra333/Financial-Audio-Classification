BULL0|"""Hey Dan Fitzpatrick."
NEUT1|Here stock market mentor.com so yesterday excuse me I focused on Lam Research.
BEAR2|Noting that this stock could do one or two things here, it could pull back.
BULL3|And it could pull back and give you a better entry point back here, or it could break out in your in at 600.
NEUT4|And so it gave us the Inn at 600 deal and so now what?
NEUT5|I would suggest doing is if you're long this stock, you're good.
NEUT6|Depending on what kind of trader you are, you know you have some decisions to make on this on this weekly chart which is here.
NEUT7|This is your weekly chart on the weekly chart.
NEUT8|You can see how this thing zigzag and, but it's up above 600.
NEUT9|Now.
NEUT10|This is in blue Sky.
NEUT11|I would say you know it's pretty easy to get to 700.
NEUT12|That's another 10% or so.
NEUT13|That would be my my measured move here.
NEUT14|We've got the low here, we'll call it 500.
NEUT15|This last top of the trading range here 600.
NEUT16|100 bucks looks like it to me.
NEUT17|My price target on this would be 700.
BULL18|The trend is intact again.
BULL19|The breakout was big, the big volume started on Wednesday on Thursday of a long weekend.
NEUT20|This kind of volume is pretty strong.
BULL21|Also keep in mind we've got earnings.
NEUT22|In three weeks on the 21st and so, I think what's happening is when you think about this with the semi conductor shortage basically on for the most part on the planet Earth.
NEUT23|That's where most of the shortage is occurring on Earth.
NEUT24|Then you got stocks like Lam Research that are really going to have made a lot of good money here, and so because this is what they do, and I think the markets anticipating that I would stay long on this stock.
NEUT25|Give this about 5:00 or 6% right now and just let the stock run.
NEUT26|Now you go ahead and make that money and we'll go back and look at it next week.
BULL27|OK, I'm hope you all have an enjoyable three day weekend.
NEUT28|Happy early Easter.
NEUT29|Remember the reason for the holiday?
NEUT30|It's really not about eggs and bad candy.
NEUT31|"Alright, see you Monday."""
