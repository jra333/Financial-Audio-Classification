NEUT0|"""The 1980s and 1990s often featured fed chairs, Paul Volcker and Alan Greenspan, lecturing the Congress that have lawmakers wanted lower interest rates."
NEUT1|They needed to rein in public deficits Fast forward three decades, and we see that mantra flipped on its head now.
BULL2|Fed Chair Jerome Powell tells Congress that the economy needs more fiscal support to offset the pandemic.
BEAR3|Even as a US budget deficit is already a record.
NEUT4|14% of GDP.
NEUT5|Currently there are several proposals for pandemic relief, ranging from the skinny $350 billion Senate proposal to the $1.8 trillion White House offer to the 2.2 trillion stimulus advocated by the majority in the House of Representatives every $200 billion in additional stimulus adds about 1% of GDP to the deficit.
NEUT6|As such, either the proposal from the White House or from the House of Representatives.
BULL7|Could bring the deficit to 23 to 25% of GDP.
NEUT8|This raises questions for bond investors that relate back to the Fed when the first stimulus package passed Congress in March.
NEUT9|the Fed.
BEAR10|But much of the newly issued debt and supported by Fed buying longer term bond yields remained low and stable, but would fed the Fed by such a large portion of a second round of stimulus.
NEUT11|And if not, will bond yields rise?
NEUT12|A case can be made either way.
BEAR13|Under one hand, back in March, equity prices had fallen 30% and credit spreads were widening.
BULL14|the Fed bought bonds not just to a dorm rising federal debt, but also to stave off a credit crunch.
BULL15|Now, stocks are near record highs, and credit markets are functioning well, so the Fed might be less inclined to do a second massive round of QE.
NEUT16|On the other hand, between 2009 and 2014 the Fed did three successive waves of QE, and the last two came even as equity prices rose in the economy recovered.
NEUT17|In addition, looming, consumer and business defaults could justify more fed by essentially bond investors face several layers of uncertainty first.
NEUT18|What kind of stimulus bill might eventually be signed into law?
NEUT19|Second, when Congress when will Congress in the White House reach an agreement?
NEUT20|3 How much of a newly issued debt might be absorbed under the Fed's balance sheet?
NEUT21|And finally, for how much might the yield curve steepen if the Fed doesn't buy a significant portion of that debt?
BEAR22|In the meantime, investors will watch closely for signals from Washington, and it's not just bond investors who will be impacted a steep rise in long term bond yields could also pull investors away from stocks and precious metals.
