NEUT0|"""Members of a subreddit group have been going toward this week with some of the world's riches, hedge fund managers over this GameStop is one of the world's largest video game retailers for PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, and much more."
BEAR1|But lately they struggled with just how easy it is for customers to download games directly to their computers and consoles.
NEUT2|Now I'm about to go inside of my local GameStop, see what people are making up this news, and while it has a nice coat of paint, you wouldn't be able to tell that this store was valued at $23 million.
NEUT3|Let's see what boots are shopping for.
NEUT4|I was shopping today.
NEUT5|It said look for a gift for my son just looking Pok√©mon cards from shopping for PlayStation Two GameStop is made headlines this city.
NEUT6|Are you familiar with wine?
BEAR7|Yeah, I think that they were making headlines with the with the stock is blowing up just going crazy.
NEUT8|Stock price errors at no clue about.
NEUT9|I do know big coin is going to try to get that number.
NEUT10|Seems really really hard game.
NEUT11|Something that big number.
NEUT12|I think it.
NEUT13|It tells me that big things are to come.
NEUT14|But again, I'm not highly educated on the recent past and why it seems like some of that money could be going through, you know, should be going to a good cause.
NEUT15|Maybe they can contribute to.
NEUT16|Vaccinations.
BULL17|I'm glad to hear, though, that things are going well for the company, so it's good.
NEUT18|Investment these days, would everybody stay at home?
BULL19|I guess gaming is on the rise.
NEUT20|Cries because everybody's into gaming.
NEUT21|Even folks my age.
NEUT22|My thoughts on getting something around which is longer.
NEUT23|I would say yeah, there really isn't much more other stores to kind of get your video game stuff or just concentrates on what you came here for.
NEUT24|I think will be around for a long time, especially at times like now because we're in a pandemic and so many kids are at home and so many other people are discovering games.
NEUT25|Great, you got all the games I'm looking to revisit games like Crash Bandicoot, Spyro the Dragon.
NEUT26|You like that game?
NEUT27|Just want to go back in time for a little bit, you know just visit the childhood, I don't think.
NEUT28|Hello coming here.
NEUT29|News about GameStop.
NEUT30|It doesn't change anything for me personally.
NEUT31|"As a consumer, you know, I'm always going to want to come here if I'm looking for anything to be done for myself and for my kids."""
