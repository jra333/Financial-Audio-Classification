NEUT0|"""What are we looking at?"
NEUT1|Netflix?
BULL2|They had a fantastic earnings and this move has finally broken out where we're looking at here again.
NEUT3|Netflix for the past coming months from literally 2 earnings ago way back when in the summer time on like basically the 7:20 time frame it has been trading chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
BULL4|Finally again with this earnings.
BEAR5|Huge volume spike.
NEUT6|That's the blue thing right here.
NEUT7|Finally breaking in.
BEAR8|Breaching above that 575, which we've really failed at once and twice here.
NEUT9|So this is again.
NEUT10|Huge moving, higher looking for some targets around 600 even up to 6:50 with this particular trend if he wants to continue with a large deviation move like this, be very mindful of some short term pullbacks.
BULL11|We're going to looking again at 575, even up to 550 would be a healthy pullback.
NEUT12|That being said, guys be safe.
NEUT13|Be safe out there and I'll catch you guys.
NEUT14|"On the flip side."""
