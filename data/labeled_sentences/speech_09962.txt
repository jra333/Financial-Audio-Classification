BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on guys?"
BEAR1|Today I'll be talking bout HFE stock and will do a technical analysis and price prediction for today and I looks like it was around $2.00 a week ago and I started to skyrocket up out around like $6 and start to fall and here it did the same thing today and went all the way up to 6030% and now start to fall again just like how it did here and we could see a potential breakout once again just to follow the pattern and it could go 10 to $15.00 just in my opinion.
NEUT2|It's not financial advice and if you go look at the chart.
NEUT3|We could see that the one you chart in the volume is at like a rock 250,000,000 right now, it's like 162,000,000, and they usually take trades around 1,000,000 to 10 million volume.
NEUT4|And so you know as potential growth an if we look at the five day chart, we can see the pattern.
NEUT5|So it goes up.
BULL6|Consolidates down, goes up.
BULL7|It's going up again and it's going down so it's probably gonna break out once more and hit probably 10 to $15.00 range.
NEUT8|So yeah, that's just my prediction on it under the prediction I think is going to stay at this price.
NEUT9|We follow a bit more, but the next coming weeks it's going to go to $10.
