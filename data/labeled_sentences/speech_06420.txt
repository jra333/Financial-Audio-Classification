NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to elitewiththisfocus.com YouTube channel."
NEUT1|My name is Henry.
NEUT2|Today is Tuesday, September.
NEUT3|The first the time is around 2:30 AM GMT.
NEUT4|So today we will be looking at the chart of Alphabet.
NEUT5|This is previously called Google.
NEUT6|Alright GOGL 45 minutes chart.
NEUT7|We can see right here.
BEAR8|Rally has been quite impulsive again, see 12345.
NEUT9|Ending here and we're calling that with three in the black degree, right?
NEUT10|Many degree and now doing a 7 swing correction wxy tables exactly.
NEUT11|This is going to be the next support area for Alphabet an.
BULL12|From here we can go to new high again, or at least pounds in three waves.
NEUT13|I think if you take a look here.
BEAR14|This pullback here now.
NEUT15|This just look like a three wave so far.
BULL16|So that is telling us that again at the trend still is firmly bullish as we do not see any five ways down from the pecan.
NEUT17|Only so far only three waves.
NEUT18|So this is a corrective structure right here, because the first leg is telling us the clue that this is corrective and therefore again.
BULL19|This area most likely then should be able to find some sort of support for three S pounds, at least if not going to a new high all right now.
NEUT20|If you do, using the retracement from the width tool, you will find out that the 23 point 638.2 typically test where we four shoot N has an overlap and nice overlap.
NEUT21|With this.
BULL22|With this first blue box so suggesting again the area has a pretty good chance to see some sort of support for more upside.
NEUT23|Google zooming out a little bit now in 2 E 4 hour timeframe without you know to give a context, only, not really.
NEUT24|With the full labels discussing the labels here, but if you take a look at the four hour chart, we can see clearly from here to in 29.
NEUT25|It's just simply looking from June 29.
NEUT26|You can see this three weeks up right there is move here.
NEUT27|I simply just measuring the 100%.
NEUT28|You find out OK, so first of all, this one looks impulsive, and that's exactly what this is all about, right?
NEUT29|This is one 477.
NEUT30|Is let me see.
NEUT31|If I got it right, one 477 is somewhere here.
NEUT32|I think.
NEUT33|Yeah, somewhere here.
NEUT34|So this is a 12 and then 3/4.
NEUT35|Now you notice here we have not reached the minimum here, which is 100%.
BULL36|So at the least, we should be able to see the 1687 here to complete 100% extension from June 29 and.
BULL37|Shorter cycle any pullback is going to find support here in Alphabet.
NEUT38|In three 7-Eleven.
NEUT39|24 For the upset.
