BULL0|"""Well, the EV market is growing and even market will be on search for the next couple of years."
NEUT1|But which other companies you should look forward to.
NEUT2|Invest to buy stocks to take an ownership.
NEUT3|Besides Tesla, let's see what Kathy Woods, the CEO of Arc invest looking when they trying to identify which is the next big electric vehicle manufacturer.
NEUT4|Well, we're looking because if we're right, this market is going to go from 2.2 million sales.
NEUT5|That's units.
NEUT6|In 2020, it might be 2.3 to 40 million in 2025.
BULL7|So all of these announcements have increased our confidence that the capital markets are going to finance this transition from internal combustion engine to electric.
BULL8|That's great.
NEUT9|Who is going to be leading the charge, so to speak?
NEUT10|We still think it is Tesla.
NEUT11|Certainly in the United States, even in China, Tesla is the number one brand.
NEUT12|Now, the smaller vehicles in China, there is a company I forgotten its name.
NEUT13|It might be associated with SAIC.
NEUT14|Anji M by the way that is pulling ahead, but that's not accounted.
NEUT15|As a true electric vehicle, these are the ones that go 25 miles an hour.
NEUT16|Golf cart types of things.
NEUT17|So we think that China might hold the secret as to the next big winners.
NEUT18|We know that Neo we do not own Neo, it's a battery swapping company.
NEUT19|So instead of charging, they swap batteries.
BULL20|That that is going to win win the day.
NEUT21|We think that X Peng, which we do not own but which is emulating Tesla might we're seeing and we do on in our more specialized strategies.
BULL22|BYD was a battery manufacturer to begin with and Warren Buffett owns has owned for many years apiece of BYD that has done very well.
NEUT23|We own that and then.
NEUT24|Geely which bought Volvo an and I believe the chairman of Geely owns a position in Daimler.
NEUT25|It is also doing a lot of interesting things.
NEUT26|Bogus is we can see the EV market.
BEAR27|It's already crowded.
NEUT28|It's very hard to predict which company will get ahead besides Tesla, because Tesla has technology in place.
BULL29|Has one of the best softwares and had the best designers.
NEUT30|We all know people love tests where people love you will mask which is the most important thing here.
BULL31|But definitely look optimistic about new as well.
NEUT32|And she pointed out she she went heavily on pointing out that new.
NEUT33|It's a battery swapping company.
NEUT34|It will know the big long term investors in tests were seeing test whereas Energy Company not as an automaker because in the future of Tesla, Tesla will take care of the utility provider for the Internet resources.
BULL35|"So this has the potential to become the main source of revenue for Tesla."""
