NEUT0|"""Bob is on here."
NEUT1|Welcome to the ETF Edge portion of halftime report, trying to keep up with the frenzy of retail trading is not easy, but our two guests today.
NEUT2|Well, they're trying.
NEUT3|Jamie Wise is the founder of the newly launched Vaneck vectors Social Sentiment ETF that's BZZ Buzz and Art.
NEUT4|Amador is the brains behind the AI powered equity ETF.
NEUT5|The symbol there AI EQ.
NEUT6|He uses artificial intelligence to pick stocks with the highest capital appreciation.
NEUT7|Jamie, we had you on a month ago when Buzz launched with Dave.
NEUT8|Portnoy as your partner.
NEUT9|You've got nearly $500 million in assets under management in just a month.
NEUT10|The funds heavily weighted towards all those old school tech names Apple, Amazon, AMD, but you've got a smattering of square Tesla Virgin Galactic thrown in.
NEUT11|You've got a month of experience.
NEUT12|Now what are investors saying on social media about the state of the markets right now?
BULL13|Yeah hi Bob, thanks great to be back here.
NEUT14|You know it's interesting you mentioned.
NEUT15|Certainly there's some technology and growth oriented names in the buzz index, but they're not necessarily the drivers of performance, and it's always so unique about the index is it's dynamic ability to listen to what investors are talking about and understand whether it's growth or value or old industrial names that might be leading performance so far this year.
BULL16|Buzz is up about 13% when we look at the names that are driving performance.
NEUT17|It's a lot of those older names.
NEUT18|Names like Ford names like American Airlines even know of acts that are in the top performers.
BEAR19|We just rebalanced the index last month.
NEUT20|As you know, the index re balances every month and we do see that tilt continuing where we have names like Costco, Target, Occidental Petroleum, Norwegian Cruise Lines, even United Airlines coming into the index.
NEUT21|So a bit of a shift more towards those industrial and value names away from some of the higher growth tech names.
NEUT22|Yeah, quite a diverse group that you've got in there now.
NEUT23|Art, AI EQ continues to have a fairly heavy bets on old school tech.
NEUT24|Apple Applied Materials, alphabet, Intel, your topics here.
NEUT25|What in your model is continuing to recommend a heavy weighting of technology?
NEUT26|Even though you could go anywhere, the model actually takes you.
NEUT27|Yeah, so Bob the IBM wants and then you got a models or German positive signals right now for technology, hardware demand and these signals are being aggregated across news.
NEUT28|Social media industry reports open market data, financial statements and much more.
BULL29|Lastly, hardware is driving the need for chips so ECU is materially overweight in semiconductors and semiconductor names and this has really benefited over the last 12 months.
BULL30|They accuse up over 80%.
NEUT31|Alright, Art and Jamie.
BULL32|"Thanks very much."""
