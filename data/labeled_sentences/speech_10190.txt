NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Friends and fellow investors.
NEUT2|Welcome back to the channel.
NEUT3|My name is Nick and today have a great one for you guys.
NEUT4|This time about a Voyager digital and this stock has been absolutely dominating the market.
NEUT5|I want to talk a little bit about the company, what they're doing, an in the end, look to draw some conclusions and ultimately give you my price prediction for this stock.

NEUT11|So what exactly is Voyager digital?
NEUT12|For those of you that don't know, Voyager Digital is an online digital asset brokerage, which is revolutionizing the way that we buy digital assets.
NEUT13|For example, Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any altcoin are NFT for that matter.
BULL14|And Voyager Digital has an amazing development team, if I'm not mistaken.
NEUT15|The CEO formerly worked for E Trade, which is another billion dollar trading platform.
NEUT16|And on this side of the screen I'm going to put up the six month chart for the stock where you can see that it has lowest beneath $0.60.
BEAR17|An is currently trading over $24.00, which is absolutely outstanding and I think that this stock in the very near future is going to crush the $30 level and in the foreseeable future crush that $40 level.
NEUT18|And I think that this stock should be valued in the 40 to $45.00 range.
BULL19|That I'm making this video and as they acquire more customers, I think that will see this stock eventually explode even higher.
NEUT20|So, like I said before, Voyager is basically revolutionizing the way that we buy digital assets, and they're doing this in the way where they are, eliminating the ridiculous transaction fees that we get charged from traditional brokers like Coinbase and Binance.
NEUT21|And just to give you guys a little bit of context.
NEUT22|Not long ago I bought some ethereum off Coinbase and I was charged a ridiculous $500 just to purchase the Ethereum just for the transaction fee alone and nothing else.
NEUT23|So with that being said.
NEUT24|We can expect newcomers into the crypto space and people currently invested in crypto currencies to eventually switch completely to a platform where they don't get charged.
NEUT25|These ridiculous transaction fees and can actually enjoy more of their money.
NEUT26|Who knows?
BEAR27|I think that in the future Voyager is going to force brokerages like Coinbase and Binance to restructure their fees so that they actually keep some of their current customers.
NEUT28|And like I said, I think that Voyager is honestly on some future wave.
NEUT29|Let me know what you guys think in the comment section below.
BULL30|I think that is going to continue upward.
NEUT31|My price prediction for this stock is in the 45 to $50 range.
NEUT32|Let me know what you guys think.
NEUT33|I would love to hear about it.
NEUT34|"Enjoy the rest of your day, bye."""
