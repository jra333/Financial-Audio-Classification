BULL0|"""Welcome again ladies and gentlemen to rogue economics."
NEUT1|This is lesson #12 I'm your rogue, economist Sanford Con, otherwise known as a business author and also a business speaker.
NEUT2|Title this presentation is the Alcapone Law of economics.
NEUT3|Basically the Al Capone Law of economic states that if there is the demand for a product or service, specially sufficient demand for a product or service, it will always be met at a certain price level, no matter if that product or service is legal or illegal.
NEUT4|It will always be met.
NEUT5|Al Capone proved that in the 1930s with liquor there was a prohibition on the sale of liquor to the public in the 1930s until their constitutional amendment was revoked.
NEUT6|Al Capone met it, but at times it went through violent means with other gangs, I agree.
NEUT7|But he proved the point that if there's a demand.
NEUT8|For a practice service, both legal and illegal.
NEUT9|The market will always move to satisfy that demand.
NEUT10|So no matter what governments do.
NEUT11|Any government, no matter what they do.
NEUT12|If there's the man from whatever they're trying to outlaw, it will always be met.
NEUT13|Always be met.
NEUT14|This is neither right nor wrong.
NEUT15|I'm just saying this is how it works.
NEUT16|Throughout history, the markets always move to satisfy the demand.
NEUT17|That's the economic law of Al Capone.
NEUT18|He proved it, but politicians being politicians, they feel they have the power to.
NEUT19|The power to outlaw certain products or services.
NEUT20|Fine, but if there is a demand for that product or service, a sufficient demand, there will always be met by someone.
NEUT21|Always be met, someone by someone at a certain price level.
NEUT22|That's the economic law of Al Capone.
