NEUT0|"""Everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see from this daily chart.
NEUT2|Actually, today it has formed a green candle with long lower tail.
NEUT3|It means supporting underneath with the smaller model.
NEUT4|It means the selling pressure.
NEUT5|Not big, but also the supporting strength is not so strong.
BULL6|But anyway we have closed above the EMS and also we have full days of gain.
NEUT7|And as we can see here this is a double shift.
NEUT8|Bottom, The double shift bottom one is here.
NEUT9|The bottom to the here and also this load is higher than this low, so it's a bullish sign for Apple stock if we change it to the weekly chart we can see here.
NEUT10|The double shape is more clear and.
NEUT11|If we check the pattern, we can see actually the.
BEAR12|This point is still be the virtual resistance hanging above, but the volume down here has been.
BULL13|Higher compared to before, so we can see.
NEUT14|Here's a little bit distribution by the institution, but as to the volume, here is not so strong.
NEUT15|So should we be be careful in the next few weeks so it's the mid term pattern.
BULL16|So if we change it to the monthly pattern we can see the uptrend from the from April this year still kept intact so don't easily judge that it has been topped here.
NEUT17|So because I will still have strong earnings, so let's wait and see what will happen.
BULL18|"Thank you."""
