BULL0|"""Apple is showing a very strong trend and in a good way a reasonable strong trend."
NEUT1|That's what I like.
BULL2|We have three solid touches.
NEUT3|We have a first touch here.
NEUT4|Second, touch here and a third touch here over a long trend.
NEUT5|I'm a huge fan of long trends because that implies stability.
NEUT6|Now Apple did have this area up here and if you watched.
NEUT7|My technical analysis over the last couple of weeks I originally had trendlines following this area and they were following the trend.
BULL8|But I did not believe it could sustain this.
NEUT9|Rocket Ship rises, just not sustainable.
BULL10|However, this is a much more reasonable trajectory trajectory and definitely sustainable.
NEUT11|And it to me it's no surprise that it has come back to this line of support.
NEUT12|And now we have.
NEUT13|Three or four days of hovering around this support area.
BULL14|So it's to me this is a very good entry point.
BULL15|It's proved that the stock can get up to 1:45, so it's got all of this area as upside.
NEUT16|We're talking another 16% before it even gets.
BULL17|Right at the most recent all time high.
NEUT18|That's a very good time to enter.
NEUT19|I personally might wait a little bit only because the broad market is.
NEUT20|Very iffy right now.
NEUT21|We're just not really clear on what the indexes are doing just yet.
BULL22|Let's see what happens this week, but I am very tempted to actually invest starting tomorrow because I know there's quite a bit of upside and it made a very solid clear.
BULL23|Touch here, that's a big sign for me and we've had.
BULL24|Two or three days of very strong volume, specially on Friday we had.
BULL25|Positive volume Ana.
NEUT26|Good price movement.
BULL27|Decent price movement, but the potential is there.
NEUT28|"Let's see what happens."""
