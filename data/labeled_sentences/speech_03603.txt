BULL0|"""Tizanidine back and we're still in market."
NEUT1|Clubs digital Dan and we're looking at Google.
BULL2|That's right, the stock has had a nice move.
NEUT3|Most of that a curd in.
BULL4|August and through to October with a huge move from 500, actually 480.
BULL5|If we get really technical up to 740, a tremendous move percentage wise.
NEUT6|Added billions of dollars on the bottom line of Google stock.
BEAR7|But we've also recently had this sharp pullback and that's we want to look at today.
NEUT8|So let's analyze this closely.
NEUT9|Let's take off these little drawings off the screen and let's get closer.
NEUT10|In on Google Now what I want to show you is the fibbonaci we talked about this on the Apple.
NEUT11|Video and we're going to apply the same principles to Google and we can click on the very high point of Google, which is right here.
NEUT12|And then click on the very low point, which is just a curd last.
NEUT13|This week, so here we are.
BEAR14|The market has pulled back quite dramatically with you've gone to the first retracement level, which is a 38% retracement level.
BULL15|Remember, Apple went to 62 percent is actually so much more strength than Google, so possibly we may see further strength in Google, but between 686 and 700 this markets going to hard time.
NEUT16|We expect to see Google.
NEUT17|Trade around and then retest these lows that we see right here.
NEUT18|This market is definitely much more in a two way mode.
NEUT19|It is definitely a trading market as opposed to a.
NEUT20|Longer term investment market right now.
NEUT21|That's what we're seeing.
NEUT22|We have a confused picture of trading picture as opposed to a trending picture.
NEUT23|So that's what we're looking at.
NEUT24|"I want to direct you to two other stocks we look at Apple and we're also going to look at RIM, so stay tuned."""
