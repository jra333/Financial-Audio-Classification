NEUT0|"""Welcome to lunch break."
NEUT1|I'm Lee Hawkins in for Tanya Rivero.
BULL2|the US economy grew at three point, 7% seasonally adjusted annual rate.
NEUT3|In the second quarter of 2015.
BULL4|That's a much brisker pace than first estimated.
NEUT5|What does this mean for the economy and how will it impact the Federal Reserve's upcoming decision on whether or not to raise interest rates?
BULL6|Joining us now to discuss this is WJS Erik Morales, Eric, always great to see you.
BULL7|Good to see you.
NEUT8|OK, So what was behind the expansion?
BULL9|While there is a lot of revisions in this morning's report, one of them was that business investment picked up at a much faster pace than previously thought.
NEUT10|Businesses were spending that construction software.
BEAR11|Those types of items, but there was also a big buildup in inventories, and that's not always seen as a great sign for the economy.
BULL12|That means that we had some economic expansion because stores and warehouses were well stocked.
BEAR13|That might mean next quarter we have a little bit of a slowdown as we let that.
BEAR14|Inventory dissipate OK, so growth averaged only two point 2% during the first half of the year, which was in line with expectations.
BULL15|Do economists expect healthy growth to carry into the third quarter?
NEUT16|Well, there's a lot of questions about how this next quarter will play out.
BEAR17|For one, we've seen the tribulations in the financial markets and the slowing economy in China, and that's expected to be a headwind to US growth.
NEUT18|And there's some questions about what something like government spending, which was way up in the second quarter.
BULL19|And that's something that's really going to continue throughout the year.
BEAR20|A lot of state and local governments are still struggling with tight budgets, so probably somewhere around that 2% range is more likely than a breakout 3, three and a half percent.
NEUT21|OK, GDP data of course offers a backward view of the economy detailing a three month stretch that ended in June.
NEUT22|Could the latest market volatility and the devaluation of the wand cast greater uncertainty to the future of the US economy?
NEUT23|Well, yeah, I think that's certainly the case when it comes to the Feds decision next in the next few weeks.
NEUT24|I think they'll be looking more at those factors.
BULL25|I think this report might give them some confidence that at least through the first half of the year, there hasn't been an economic slowdown.
NEUT26|But I think the more recent news will play a greater role in both how the economy will grow in the second half of the year and what the Fed will do.
NEUT27|OK, in terms of whether or not to hike interest rates in mid September.
NEUT28|Yeah, I don't think that this report is really going to change the Federal Reserve's view.
NEUT29|I'd actually be looking very closely at tomorrow's report on inflation will be one of the last inflation readings that they'll see.
NEUT30|They're really hoping to see some firming and that and then of course the jobs report on September 4th really could be a make or break data point for the Fed.
NEUT31|Eric Maurath always with the great analysis.
BULL32|Thanks a lot buddy.
BULL33|"Alright, thank you."""
