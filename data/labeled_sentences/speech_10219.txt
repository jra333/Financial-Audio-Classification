BULL0|"""Hello Friends, welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video."
NEUT1|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about Jiayin group INCJAYN now.
NEUT2|If you are looking at this talk.
NEUT3|What you can see here.
NEUT4|Is a break out that?
NEUT5|I'm about to show you.
NEUT6|So.
NEUT7|Yeah we have.
BULL8|Yeah, this is a breakout level that the stock has recently crossed.
NEUT9|And it is at around 9.12 and the stock is currently quoting at 9.41 on closing basis.
NEUT10|Now the nature of the stock is very much volatile becauses as you can see in the month of June 2020.
NEUT11|It's one month Bahar worth 1200% so the movement or the volatility Sky high so make sure you are putting a very strict stop loss.
NEUT12|OK so that's the most important thing you need to do.
BEAR13|And otherwise there are two instances where the stocks shoot up very sharply and falling down.
NEUT14|So if you're looking at this kind of stock, you make sure that you have your strict stop loss on the downside and.
NEUT15|Targeted point on the upside, so that once it hits it will automatically get sold and you need not to wait for a manual level to exit.
NEUT16|OK now having said that.
NEUT17|If it continues to hold above 9.2, which it is right now, then we are going to look at two specific targets.
NEUT18|On the upside, and those are.
NEUT19|So what you have here, your first target will be 18.34.
NEUT20|And your final target will come at $30.00, so these are the two targets that we're looking at for the time being but.
BEAR21|As I told you, this is a very volatile stock volitility place on both the ways.
BEAR22|If it is on your side then you will make lots of money and if it is on the opposite side then you're bound to lose lots of money.
NEUT23|So be respectful to the levels and don't try to you know go and do some things which you don't understand, so be disciplined.
NEUT24|You have your stop loss and you have your target.
NEUT25|So this is the end of the video.
