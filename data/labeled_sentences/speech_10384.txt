BEAR0|"""Shares of Tesla meantime stabilizing the free market today after falling 8% in reaction to that miss on deliveries."
BEAR1|Meantime, federal court Judge Alison Nathan giving Musk and the SEC two weeks to resolve their dispute over whether Musk's tweets violated a settlement agreement.
NEUT2|Must talk to our fill a boat right after the hearing.
NEUT3|Take a listen to that.
BULL4|Very impressed with the judge nation.
NEUT5|Just judge Nathan.
NEUT6|Just a outstanding representative of history.
NEUT7|Word do you think you can work this out with the FCC over the next two weeks?
NEUT8|Look like.
NEUT9|The quote making the rounds today is put your reasonable pants on.
NEUT10|Yeah, I never actually heard Sponge Bob Square pants be invoked in federal court.
BEAR11|This was incredible embarrassment for the SEC.
NEUT12|Did not see this coming.
NEUT13|Plus Elon must talk about what a great jurist years after it.
NEUT14|I mean, if you go to the back to the SEC's complaint, what they appended?
NEUT15|Two pieces of research which said the most important thing is the number of deliveries.
BEAR16|Yesterday was a day where the deliveries were so bad that the stock costs almost 10% of its value.
NEUT17|But the judge did not seem to even understand the importance of deliveries and what it meant to the stock.
NEUT18|The judge just seemed to say SEC.
NEUT19|Are you kidding me?
BEAR20|There was a noted there was a bit of a, I think a disconnect between the judge and what Wall Street looks at.
NEUT21|Disconnect man am I ever diplomat.
BULL22|That was incredible.
NEUT23|Why she?
NEUT24|Why did they append the research pieces just to show her how material this was and she basically said no go put some pants on, get back together, she indicated the SEC.
NEUT25|She thought acted somewhat rashly and moving it did so quickly.
NEUT26|There's a total slap down that was it was it was incredible.
BULL27|Musk is glad he showed up, yeah.
NEUT28|Oscars like yeah, she's like if I was President color Oliver Wendell Holmes, none of that horse has much to do with the fact that the company did, or at least at this point, is not necessarily seen or has put into some jeopardy.
NEUT29|I'm going back to the fundamentals you make, whether it can actually know whether it can actually deliver what it said it would.
NEUT30|360 to 400, let alone the 500 that he put in the original tweet that got him in.
NEUT31|So yeah, that's what was so incredible that she was so clueless about what is the real driver here.
NEUT32|Which is that if you say there's gonna be 500,000, then of course he changed it to be run rated in the year 500,000 stock should be 400, so it was probably the most meaningful and material thing that that that that he could have treated.
NEUT33|But the judge wanted them to put on their reasonable pants.
NEUT34|Was that the Golden slacks?
NEUT35|She don't hold this life, so it sounds like you don't agree with her that you think the SEC had a stronger case for contempt then she thinks.
NEUT36|Just think that she didn't really understand Wall Street.
NEUT37|As he sees about Wall Street and she just I don't want to say she's poor, she's a distinguished.
NEUT38|Don't want she didn't know what she was talking about.
NEUT39|That would be correct.
BEAR40|You know that would be too hard.
BEAR41|I just think she was ill advised.
NEUT42|Or maybe maybe not, but maybe not.
NEUT43|Maybe not.
NEUT44|What exact?
NEUT45|Maybe she just feels like you know what?
NEUT46|This is not something that rises to contempt.
NEUT47|Figure it out.
NEUT48|I was and you can't get more content than a guy.
NEUT49|I mean, he was basically saying that the only serious SEC is the one that is on CBS.
BEAR50|"Right here with almost recruiting violations."""
