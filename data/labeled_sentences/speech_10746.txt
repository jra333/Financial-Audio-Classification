NEUT0|"""So how many middle men do you cut out?"
NEUT1|I mean for term insurance, for instance, I've always known that people insured people don't want to sell term.
NEUT2|Why?
NEUT3|'cause they don't make much money on it, but that's not your ethos.
NEUT4|Jarritos is to get people to do a lot of business with you, so you probably aren't losing money on term.
NEUT5|No, and we get to launcher.
NEUT6|We announced it just today and will launch it sometime in the next 90 days.
NEUT7|We haven't given a precise date, but you're right, that's the beauty of technology, isn't it?
BULL8|That you can give people a superior experience while cutting out costs crushing costs while delighting consumers.
NEUT9|And if I'm paying you claims in three seconds, you know that humans aren't in the loop, but you're not going to feel the lack of them are.
BEAR10|You're going to be thrilled with that, so so many industries are being disrupted.
NEUT11|I think that insurance is the single most destructible industry on the planet.
NEUT12|And it really is so powerful when you can build an insurance company from scratch using a digital substrate.
NEUT13|All of these benefits accrue.
NEUT14|Now I could agree with you more, but I was talking my staff.
NEUT15|I said do we really want lemonade on?
NEUT16|I like the guy, but does anyone anyone know lemonade?
NEUT17|I figured that people going to say, well, listen Jim and now what are you talking about?
NEUT18|I'd say the majority of my staff uses lemonade.
NEUT19|How did they find out about you?
BULL20|Well, first of all, thank you for them for their business and so happy to hear that they're using it and now they're happy about it.
NEUT21|Look with the results that we just announced this quarter.
NEUT22|You know it's a pandemic, and all of that.
BULL23|We just doubled our business year on year.
BULL24|So Q3 this year to Q3 last year, gross and premium more than doubled, while our losses and we ask the losing money hard in terms of losses per dollar of gross own premiums.
BULL25|So we are seeing these dynamics of fast growing top line, tremendous efficiencies and.
NEUT26|Increasing profitability into the bottom line and it really is through the delighting of consumers, so all of those folks that you asked about lemonade, and they put their hands up.
NEUT27|They tell each other.
NEUT28|They get a good experience, they pass it on.
BULL29|We are maniacally focused on delighting consumers, and we think a lot of benefits come out of that.
BULL30|One of them is lower cost of acquisition, higher retention rates.
BEAR31|In fact, our spend on sales and marketing this quarter was 25% lower in absolute terms.
BULL32|In the same time last year, even though our business is twice as big.
NEUT33|So you really start seeing that.
NEUT34|Feedback loop kicking.
BULL35|Better experiences.
NEUT36|More delighted consumers, lower costs, higher attentions you start seeing the flywheel spin.
