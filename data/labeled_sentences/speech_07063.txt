NEUT0|"""The America's richest families list looks at the wealthiest families in the United States, so it doesn't include just individual fortunes."
NEUT1|Somebody like Warren Buffett or Elon Musk?
NEUT2|This looks more at Multigeneration families.
NEUT3|People who maybe maybe two generations in there, maybe five generations in.
NEUT4|When you think of the richest families in America.
NEUT5|Often times, you know you would think of somebody like Vanderbilts or the Astors or something like that.
NEUT6|Interestingly, neither of those two families are among the wealthiest families in America today.
BEAR7|You know, overtime fortunes tend to dissipate this year.
NEUT8|The Walton family tops the list, and they're worth a whopping $247 billion.
NEUT9|The Waltons are the shareholders of Walmart.
NEUT10|It was founded by Sam Walton and his brother Bud, and.
NEUT11|The company pays the family which owns about half Walmart, about $700 million a year in dividends.
NEUT12|It's quite quite a fortune that they have after that.
NEUT13|It's the Koch family which is Charles Koch and Julia Koch, who is the widow of David Coke.
NEUT14|And then there are two other Koch brothers who did Heritages State from their father.
NEUT15|That family is worth about $100 billion and Coke industries is the largest private company in America.
NEUT16|And they do everything you know, the oil they they own.
NEUT17|Brawny paper towels.
NEUT18|Just a huge conglomerate and then #3 on the list is the Mars family behind the candy company Eminem.
NEUT19|Mars them about half of Mars is revenue, though is actually from pet food.
NEUT20|The family members don't run the company, but they said on some sit on the board.
NEUT21|It's fairly secretive, also privately held company.
NEUT22|I think one of the things that's interesting is the families might not be household names, but products that they produce certainly are.
NEUT23|You know, people may not have heard of the show and family, but they've certainly heard of U-Haul.
NEUT24|You might not have heard the Fisher family, but you definitely, you know, definitely no gap.
NEUT25|You probably never heard the Gore family, but you may have heard of Gore-tex.
NEUT26|You might not know the Taylor family, but you know Enterprise Rent-a-car.
NEUT27|It's kind of a crazy time in the stock markets, right?
NEUT28|So we're in this pandemic.
BEAR29|We've got food lines across the country, you know, people are worried about getting evicted if convictions aren't banned going forward.
NEUT30|And then you have new billionaires apparently coming out.
NEUT31|You know, seemingly coming out of the woodwork with initial public offerings happen.
NEUT32|The stock markets going crazy, and so this is kind of on that other, you know this.
NEUT33|A reminder of this incredible wealth inequality in our country.
NEUT34|"We have these families that hold so much wealth."""
