NEUT0|"""Hey guys it's Tony and I'm just continuing the unusual options activity series and I'm letting you know that somebody actually there's a huge volume of $13 million, which is probably one of the highest ones that I've seen recently that my code picked up on these 255 calls for January 22nd."
NEUT1|Huge, huge volume.
NEUT2|There's.
NEUT3|There's.
