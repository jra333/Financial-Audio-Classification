BEAR0|"""Going into a pretty good tape this morning, PVHS down about 1 1/2% Jim, one of the few retailers really that has said Q2 is going to be worse than Q1 was."
BEAR1|Wow, Manny Treecko magnone many times in his come, one for years and years, was, I think he was quite negative and talked about how there are many retailers that are really going to struggle here, said this year was a mess.
NEUT2|He said that he used this from BS.
NEUT3|He said no BS.
BEAR4|This is a very tough time for retail.
BULL5|There are only a few retailers that I think we're going to come to this thing unscathed.
NEUT6|One of them has a stock that's down that I think actually should be up, which is, Lululemon, I like that quarter very much, and I think that there's a lot to recommend.
NEUT7|PVH does not have necessarily the branch.
BULL8|That's Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger that can that can sustain Lululemon's been a fantastic work at home play at home company, and I thought the numbers were good and it wouldn't surprise me if that stock is able to have a run now when we talk about.
NEUT9|By the way, what's running before market?
NEUT10|I say, well, let's deal with the facts.
BULL11|Adobe was better than expected.
BEAR12|People thought that was down there with down was really bad.
BEAR13|Really bad last night that was a mistake.
BULL14|I think that Lulu is better than expected.
BEAR15|I think that American air is not better than expected.
NEUT16|I think the genius brands which trades like a Mexican jumping bean.
NEUT17|You know it's going up up, up, down, down.
NEUT18|That is the kind of thing that people are focused on.
NEUT19|'cause it's a $4 stock and I just gotta tell you call I don't mind people losing money, but I rather than lose money in real stocks so that they can buy more of them, then buy stocks and then sell them because they're not up by 10:00 o'clock and that's what I really fear.
NEUT20|I have no desire to be a killjoy.
NEUT21|I think you should buy a stock like Glenn.
BULL22|Lululemon, when it's down because it's most likely going to be up a few months from now, 'cause it's such a great brand, and it did well.
BEAR23|"I think that we are in an unfortunate period where there are a lot of people who would not buy when the Dow was down 1700 and they waited for the futures to come out of their slump and now they come in and it would have been far better had they been buying into the decline, then coming in or excited this morning."""
