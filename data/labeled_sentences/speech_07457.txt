NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Kurtz."
NEUT1|Take a look at the dollar yen and you can see the dollar yen.
BULL2|Continues to go higher and we even had the 111 area during early hours.
NEUT3|Really at this point in time, it's parabolic.
BEAR4|You know it's been hard to watch.
NEUT5|I'm the first person to admit I've missed this trade.
NEUT6|You need some type of pull bank insanity to come back in.
NEUT7|That was your signal.
NEUT8|So I think somewhere in this flag we will find plenty of support 1-12, maybe even 113 would be your target on a pullback.
NEUT9|But right now just going to have to be patient.
NEUT10|"I used this as an indicator as to what to do with the yen against other pairs like the Kiwi Aussie pound etc."""
