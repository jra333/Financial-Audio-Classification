NEUT0|"""Is £1,000,000 enough to retire on a number of studies suggest it might not stretch as far as you'd think."
NEUT1|Let's imagine a healthy 65 year old man wants to swap his £1 million pension pot for an annuity that's a regular income paid every year for the rest of his life.
BEAR2|He would get around £43,000 a year, but that means he'd need to live for another 23 years to get all of the money back, and it's not linked to inflation, so the purchasing power of that money would decrease overtime if he lived for longer than 23 years, he'd still receive the annual income, but if he.
NEUT3|Died, that's it.
NEUT4|There's no money to pass on to his heirs.
NEUT5|So what about if you keep your pension savings invested in the stock market?
NEUT6|Well, it's riskier.
BEAR7|Stocks can go down as well as up, but investors can draw down a regular income hoping that investment growth ensures their pot doesn't run out.
NEUT8|Now that £1 million pot over 30 to 40 years can generate around £33,000 a year.
NEUT9|According to projections made by the pensions and Lifetime Savings Association.
NEUT10|And Interactive Investor.
NEUT11|But that's assuming that your investments grow at 3% a year above inflation.
NEUT12|Of course, there's no guarantee that would happen.
NEUT13|So how much do we need to save some financial advisors say you should take your age, half of it, and then save that percentage of your annual salary into a pension.
NEUT14|I'm 42, so that would mean saving 21% of my salary.
NEUT15|For the record, I'm actually saving a bit more than this, but I am the money editor.
NEUT16|But the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries looked at three scenarios for a 68 year old who also gets the full state pension, which is around £8600 per year.
NEUT17|If they saved £86 per month throughout their working life, that would fund what they call a minimum standard of living.
BULL18|In retirement, an annual holiday in the UK and a budget of about £38.00 for the weekly shop, paying a bit more £799 a month, and that could fund a moderate standing of living.
NEUT19|So a two week holiday in Europe.
NEUT20|Plus 46 pounds on the weekly food shop, but for someone on average earnings that is about 1/4 of their salary.
BULL21|Paying even more £1755 per month would net you a comfortable retirement.
NEUT22|They say with regular beauty treatments, Theatre trips, and a three week annual holiday abroad.
NEUT23|Now those figures might sound high, but don't forget you get tax relief on pension contributions and often a contribution from your employer to.
NEUT24|It's estimated that millions of people in the UK are not.
NEUT25|Saving into a pension, particularly those who are self employed, but the earlier you start saving, the better.
BULL26|Even if it's quite small amounts at first, the compounding effects overtime will boost your retirement savings, and the final lever you can pull working for longer.
NEUT27|"Speaking of which, I better get back to work."""
