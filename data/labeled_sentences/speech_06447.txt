NEUT0|"""Hello fellow traders, welcome to these news who planned Demanders stock analysis this time for an Indian stock?"
NEUT1|Tata Motors from the NSA.
NEUT2|This analysis is done the July 29th, 2019.
NEUT3|This is the training disclaimer in June.
NEUT4|Come post the video and read it at anytime.
NEUT5|OK, let's go take a look at the monthly chart.
NEUT6|This is a monthly charge you can see here.
NEUT7|The watermark specifies 1M.
NEUT8|It means that every single candle you see on the chart represents one month worth of time.
BEAR9|So prices been dropping new era supplier being created out of super strong area of supply.
NEUT10|As you can see super strong 123456 years of candles.
NEUT11|Took.
BEAR12|More than half a year to retrace hit that area, created a bearish being Kendall and prices being dropping ever since.
NEUT13|Creating other supply area.
BEAR14|Select this one price never trace it did create another one over there around 2:42 price fell short of threat into it and then Robin again expecting prices to drop all the way down there where the logs will be possible again.
NEUT15|If new areas of the minor created by rain, now we have a bearish bias with new supply zones being created on the weekly in the monthly or daily charts.
NEUT16|So no matter which strategy you're trading, the bearish bias is and all of them should be in all of them.
NEUT17|So trying to go along is super aggressive suicidal.
NEUT18|If I could say so short on Tata Motors, we don't need any kind of indicators to tell us that we are.
BEAR19|We have a bearish bias with a long term downtrend.
NEUT20|So going along is just out of the equation.
NEUT21|There's no reason to go long or by Tata Motors Indian stock only to sell.
NEUT22|Shoot this talk or if you are using options, obviously lump roots or bearish spreads or whatever.
NEUT23|You're trading OK, but only shorts are allowed on Tata Motors.
NEUT24|If you are interested in learning how to trade supply demand, you can visitasacertificate.com you will be able to learn how to use, how to trade using sublime animuses supply and demand imbalances alone without using any kind of lagging indicators.
NEUT25|No news, no fundamentals, no earnings, nobody nothing at all, just pure supply and demand imbalances.
NEUT26|You will learn to locate this kind of imbalance is you will say you could say this is pretty obvious.
NEUT27|Well it is not that obvious.
NEUT28|These one is obvious but there are many that are not that.
NEUT29|Obviously like this one and many others are very strong.
NEUT30|Impulse does not necessarily mean we have an imbalance.
NEUT31|Enjoy the rest of the day and be happy.
NEUT32|"Bye bye."""
