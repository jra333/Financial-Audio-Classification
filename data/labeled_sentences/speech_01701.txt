BEAR0|"""We collapse through 1:40 this morning, which has been the long term historical floor since the mid 80s for the pound against the dollar, we drop down to 133 with now come back to just test 140."
NEUT1|So what we're seeing here, traders ascertaining whether what used to be the floor for the currency, is now the ceiling.
BEAR2|A lot of people are saying and have predicted that if we did see a Brexit, we're going to get to 120 and potentially lower on Sterling.
NEUT3|That's still in play.
BEAR4|Equities sold off hard early this morning when the Footsie opened, but we've come back a little bit, but we still down roughly 5%.
NEUT5|The big question now is, does a Brexit affect the economy that does activity slow down?
NEUT6|And does that mean home builders, retailers and banks get hit so those are the three key sectors for the Footsie.
NEUT7|Now there is a silver lining here.
NEUT8|The Footsie 100, for example, relies on a lot of foreign based earnings as the pound.
BEAR9|Sterling weakens their foreign based revenues will increase what you could potentially see.
BULL10|In the next couple of months is an M and a bonanza where foreign based companies look at UK multinationals and say I can buy that company a lot cheaper now because it's priced in Sterling terms but their revenues are actually going up because Sterling is weakening against the dollar.
NEUT11|The Footsie 250 which is the domestic barometer.
BEAR12|However things look pretty grim if indeed you do see a much slower, potentially recessionary Britain.
BEAR13|So that's why the 4250 dropped as much as 12% earlier today.
BEAR14|10 year gilt drop down towards 1% knew record low.
BULL15|The expectation here is at the Bank of England will at some point is policy maybe do more QE in conjunction, perhaps with more easing from the ECB and other central banks.
NEUT16|Therefore just buy bonds an hold those yields.
BULL17|Five days ago, risk appetite began to increase because a lot of people in the markets believed Britain was going to vote to stay.
NEUT18|And you saw people jumping into bank stocks not just here in the UK, but in the US.
NEUT19|Even in Japan, across the world.
BEAR20|And there was a big risk on rally.
NEUT21|And that effectively sort of reflects the fact that next Thursday is into the second quarter.
NEUT22|Not a lot of investors had a good Q2, so the idea here was jump on this bandwagon.
BULL23|Gatwick Surf the momentum of the UK.
BULL24|UK voted to stay and you're going to look very, very good.
BEAR25|That has completely blown up in the face of a lot of macro funds, macro hedge funds, big traders.
NEUT26|So what we could potentially be seeing in the coming weeks and weeks and months number of bodies coming to the surface.
NEUT27|Funds that have blown up.
BULL28|And that's going to actually spill over into the global markets, and we are seeing that we're seeing the yen get dramatically stronger as a byproduct of the Sterling's weakness.
BULL29|We're seeing the dollar strengthening against emerging markets.
BEAR30|So cast your mind back to what we saw back in February this year, we could potentially be seeing another replay of that scenario, which means investors are going to continue to buy top tier bond, such as US Treasurys and guilt and the German bond which they fell to a record low of negative 18 basis points.
BEAR31|They're going to shun commodities like oil and copper.
BULL32|Buy gold and gold indeed is broken out to a two year higher this morning.
BULL33|"Above $1300 an ounce and they're going to steer clear of equities."""
