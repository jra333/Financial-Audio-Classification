NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some Contacts here, but a very very impressive move.
NEUT5|So the 1st update here I'm going to do is actually just adjust this line up here to now this 119 mark 'cause in my mind this is a very important level 'cause there's no doubt about it.
NEUT6|Very impressive movement, but I mean is this the start of something bigger?
NEUT7|Is there a legitimate strength behind this movement?
BULL8|I don't know, but by using this line at 119 that can be very helpful in that regard.
NEUT9|Why so?
NEUT10|Well, hopefully we can agree on the logic that if the price were to come down in this area and then break down through there, I mean that would be putting the price quite literally right back to where it was, and I mean like I said the logic.
NEUT11|Hopefully we can agree with is that price movements with genuine power through strength.
BULL12|The price is not going to go back to where it was it's going to make at least some sort of form of progress right.
BULL13|It's going to show signs of progress forward, which is why.
NEUT14|Yeah, sure if the price comes down here, not the end of the world if it behaves like that, and then starts to curl back upwards.
NEUT15|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those there.
NEUT16|You have loads down there and if you envision each of those there are steps will be at that point you now have again progress being made in the upward direction and that's what it truly strong moves going to do as nice as it would be for a price to just go straight up that's just not reality.
NEUT17|That's not possible.
NEUT18|But as long as the price is just kind of chipping away, and building those higher late bases and showing those signs of progress.
NEUT19|That is what matters by far the most in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT20|First level to watch going to be right there at the 122 mark and then after 122.
NEUT21|If that can be broken next key level after that right up there around one 2325, but All in all great movement today.
NEUT22|Not just a question of can the price start to show some signs of progress?
NEUT23|Let's see what happens.
NEUT24|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT26|But it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL28|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT34|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live.
