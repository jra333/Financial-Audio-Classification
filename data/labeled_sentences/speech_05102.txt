NEUT4|The one I want to touch on is Netflix.
BEAR5|Unfortunately Netflix they just pretty much you know missed their their earnings mark.

NEUT7|By the way, don't forget to hit the like button and subscribe and also shared with three friends.
NEUT8|But with Netflix, you know it's.
NEUT9|It's a rather expensive stock being that is going for roughly about $500, so that's a couple $100 per share.
NEUT10|Me personally, that's not a stock that I've invested in.
NEUT11|I thought about it.
NEUT12|I just don't see how many more innovations they can make to really stay.
NEUT13|Relevant for the next 1020 years, but you know, if that's your thing, that's fine.
NEUT14|If you want to invest in a more if you're trading with options anyway, I'll talk to you guys later.
NEUT15|"Alright, talk to you later."""
