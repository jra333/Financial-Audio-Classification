BULL0|"""Welcome back to another video guys."
NEUT1|In this video, we're going to talk about Virgin Galactic stock.
NEUT2|Virgin Galactic is a basically an American company.
BULL3|Space company that is planning to have people visit space and allow space tourism in the future, and I feel like it's going to be one of the top companies in this sector in the space tourism industry.
NEUT4|And year to date.
BULL5|They were doing pretty well during January and February, but they went down in March as all companies, but they haven't quite recovered as much as most other companies are, but they are slowly going up from their all time lows in March there up 112% so they have doubled.
BEAR6|There were like $10 and now there are $22.00, but during the peak before March, before coronavirus, they're worried.
NEUT7|Almost $40.00 so there were $37.
BEAR8|There are some pretty volatile stocks in sister.
BULL9|Has a low price and moves around a lot, so now it's up 30% so $0.65.
NEUT10|And let's look at the analysis.
NEUT11|I feel like it might be a medium sized market cap.
NEUT12|Ticker symbol SPC.
NEUT13|Yeah, it's pretty small.
NEUT14|It has a market cap of $5.2 billion.
BULL15|And a 52 week range of $6 and 42 between 6:00 and $42.00.
NEUT16|If you bought a 6 and sold at 42, you don't make a lot of money.
NEUT17|But let's see.
NEUT18|In one year, what does it say?
NEUT19|It's around here.
NEUT20|That's around Techstars and around here.
NEUT21|It's not even new for me.
NEUT22|I don't know where it is.
NEUT23|This is the peak.
NEUT24|Peak value.
NEUT25|Unless you Cortana losses it's for the fourth quarter of 2020 at subway sales, growth is supposed to be 51%.
BULL26|It's very good an next quarter.
NEUT27|It's supposed to be 715, which is pretty good and all analysts say to buy all of them and one out of eight says so strong by.
NEUT28|And next year it's supposed to go by 47%, which is it like now double the SMP 500 rate.
NEUT29|That was pretty much the video.
