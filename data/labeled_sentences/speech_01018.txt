NEUT0|"""My name is Peter Bevelling from Sweden."
NEUT1|You have said that you like franchise companies.
NEUT2|Companies that have their Castle surrounded by moats companies that are possible to you can have some prediction 5-10 years down the road.
NEUT3|But aren't businesses like?
NEUT4|Sees candy, the furniture business.
NEUT5|The Urubus this the shoe business business that are hard to predict the future 5-10 years down the road.
NEUT6|The last part of them aren't these businesses hard to predict 5 or 10 years down the road.
NEUT7|Things like shoe business and I think they're far easier to predict than most businesses.
NEUT8|I. I think I can come closer.
NEUT9|To telling you the future of virtually all of the businesses we have and not just because we have him.
NEUT10|I mean if they belong to somebody else.
NEUT11|Then if I if I took the Dow 30.
NEUT12|Excluding the ones we own or with or you know, the 1st 100 companies alphabetically on the New York Stock Exchange.
NEUT13|I think they're I think ours are way easier.
NEUT14|To protect their their their.
NEUT15|They are fair.
NEUT16|They tend to be fundamental things fairly simple.
BULL17|Rate of change is not not fast, so I I feel pretty.
NEUT18|Pretty comfortable, I think when you look at at Berkshire five years from now.
NEUT19|The businesses we have now.
BULL20|Will be performing pretty much as we've anticipated at this time.
NEUT21|I hope there are some new ones and I hope their big ones, but I don't think that will have had lots of surprises and the president.
NEUT22|My guess is will have had one surprise.
NEUT23|I don't know what it will be, but I mean you know that happens in life but but there won't be a series of them, whereas if you if we were to buy.
NEUT24|We owned a base metals business or or many many retailing businesses I can think of.
NEUT25|An auto business.
NEUT26|I'm not sure I know where we would stand in the competitive pecking order.
NEUT27|5 or 10 years from now at.
NEUT28|I would not want to.
NEUT29|Try and come in an.
NEUT30|Display sees candies, for example in the business that does that, or the Furniture Mart.
NEUT31|It's just.
NEUT32|It's not an easy job, so I. I don't think you'll get lots of surprises.
NEUT33|With the present businesses of Berkshire.
NEUT34|"But the key is is developing more of them."""
