NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see here."
BEAR1|Back to the opening of the market dropped sharply and then managed to bounce back and.
NEUT2|Have a very flat pattern near the closing of the market.
NEUT3|If we change the chart into daily chart, we can see that clearly here we got another green candle with advanced day.
BULL4|So after yesterday's big jump off the gap, we have another advance day, so it's still a bullish sentiment for.
BEAR5|Apple stock, but this advance has a weak power, so that means we're very likely for.
BEAR6|To have a pullback for tomorrow, 'cause after the three days advance we have accumulated a lot of selling pressure.
BULL7|The constructive signs that we are still well above the formal high here.
NEUT8|So the top of this red candle is is 121, so as long.
BULL9|As we keep above the 121 level, we still have chance to give advance to higher.
NEUT10|So in my opinion we are still in a.
NEUT11|Early stage of the advance of Apple stock and if I go stock can make advance the whole market will go higher.
BULL12|"Thank you."""
