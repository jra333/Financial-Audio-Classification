NEUT3|Will it go parabolic sooner than later?
NEUT4|So recently on Twitter or poll was conducted to see which cryptocurrency was the most undervalued and Vechain one with 140,000 users voting for Vechain.
NEUT5|Now an analyst called Vechain.
NEUT6|Justin took the poll results and said that only adds to him being super bullish.
BULL7|On the cryptocurrency, another factor that he added in there was the vote to reduce the gas fees on Vechain, which is V4, which has been going up in price lately.
BULL8|I'm all for voting to cut gas fees, and I think that it will help in the long term.
BULL9|Just attract more people to Vechain.
NEUT10|This is not financial advice, but I plan on selling my veto in case they vote to lower the gas fees because in essence, veto won't be worth as much as it is today now.
NEUT11|Another very interesting thing is that if you look at the Vechain chart and how it's progressing.
BULL12|Cardano's chart was progressing at this same time last year.
NEUT13|It's way too similar.
BEAR14|About a year ago Cardona was training below $0.10, and then it had a bull run reaching up to about $1.47.
BULL15|Now, Vechain Justin points out the similar charts he thinks will push Vechain up to $0.77 by the 1st week of July.
NEUT16|Now, Can you imagine a 77 cent V chain by July 2021?
NEUT17|Man, I would be crazy if you look at the technicals, it looks like we're going to bust through this $0.10 pretty soon.
NEUT18|So who knows?
NEUT19|Vechain could be to the moon.
