BULL0|"""Good morning everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to live trading action by in the money stocks today is May 23rd, 2016.
NEUT2|My name is Nick Santiago.
BULL3|Thank you all for tuning in today.
NEUT4|Alright, a stock that is on my radar as a potential short play is Range Resources, ticker symbol.
NEUT5|Here's RRC and you can see that the stock put a little bit of a top in here at $44.
BULL6|Now it's had a great move off the lows from $20 which is traded in January.
NEUT7|Now it just hit a high of $44 but look what happened here.
BULL8|Stock sold off with huge massive volume.
NEUT9|You could see the volume in this candle right here was about 19 million shares in a daily chart candle.
NEUT10|That's much much higher than the average.
BEAR11|Average volume is probably around 2 1/2 to 3,000,000 a day, so the stock came down with heavy velocity that tells U.S. stock wants to go back down further.
BEAR12|So what I'm looking at now is a potential short position in the equity all the way down to probably around a $35 price target on the 1st.
BEAR13|Estimation if we go lower through there, I think we would probably trade down to around the 32 level, so these would be my two downside projections right here.
NEUT14|35 and 32.
NEUT15|So I am getting ready to short this name, but again, I just want to see a little bit more in the chart.
NEUT16|There are two places you could stop out.
NEUT17|One you can put your stop above 42 on a daily chart close or else you can put your stop really above the $44.68 level on a weekly chart close.
NEUT18|I like the bigger.
NEUT19|Time Frame weekly chart stop closeout better, but again it's up to each individual how much risk you want to take on, but this gives you a real nice potential shorting opportunity, specially if crude oil and natural gas start to decline.
NEUT20|This stock could come under some pressure since it is an independent oil and gas company, so keep Range Resources on the radar here.
NEUT21|This is a nice potential short and again if you want to trade this alongside of me, come on over, take that 7 day free trial to the intraday.
NEUT22|Excuse me to the Research Center.
NEUT23|You'll get all of our trade setups.
NEUT24|You'll get all of our cycle work.
NEUT25|You'll get all of our content and you will also receive Arnaud Hi Bly broadcasts, which we hold twice a week on Sunday evenings and also on Thursday afternoons.
NEUT26|And we allow members come in ask us questions about anything Walker related, so it's a great great program.
NEUT27|All of that is included in the Research Center product alright.
NEUT28|With that being said, everybody watch Range Resources.
NEUT29|It's on the radar and it's play.
NEUT30|We will be triggering off pretty shortly and again.
BULL31|Thank you all for tuning in.
BULL32|"Have a great session and we'll see on the charts."""
