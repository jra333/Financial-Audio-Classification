BULL0|"""Alright, we got earnings from carnival this morning."
BEAR1|Second quarter 2020 summary is preliminary US gap net loss of 4.4 billion, $6.07 diluted EPS.
NEUT2|Of course for the company.
NEUT3|Total revenues.
NEUT4|Well, they were point 7 billion.
BEAR5|Lower than the 4.8 billion Jim from the year ago, you can see what carnivals doing this morning.
NEUT6|You've talked a lot about the cruise lines, of course, and made the argument that, well, they're not really cruising, so how can you actually buy him?
NEUT7|Yeah, but there are whole cohorts of what do you want to call them.
BEAR8|Serious neophytes.
BEAR9|Radically wrong professional.
BEAR10|I don't know what to call them because they get so upset.
NEUT11|Who are playing this group?
NEUT12|Because they just think that this is the group that is when it's green light economy by Karna Bora green light virus by Carnival and I think it's much more difficult than that.
NEUT13|I mean these companies burn a considerable amount of cash.
NEUT14|They do.
NEUT15|They have to come back to the equity market.
NEUT16|Let's just say that if I were carnival and I did a big deal at 8, how about a bigger deal at 17?
NEUT17|Right, well I know I maybe they have to by the way.
NEUT18|To that point, and I just want to make sure I get it right here, Jim.
NEUT19|We're talking about they have.
BULL20|7.6 billion available liquidity right now, and they expect to they say further enhance future liquidity, including for refinancing scheduled debt maturities.
NEUT21|They also have 8.8 billion of committed export credit facilities available to fund ship deliveries that are planned through 2023.
NEUT22|Yeah, and I don't get the customer deposits David 2.9 billion right now.
BULL23|You burned 4.4 this quarter OK, and actually had some revenue coming in an.
NEUT24|You've got 7.6 billion available liquidity.
NEUT25|May I suggest that you do a deal because you do want to stay in business for more than 1/4 and a half?
NEUT26|These other forms of doing it?
NEUT27|I mean why not to your point, if courts can now they may not be there.
BEAR28|Probably not going to be allowed to do it, but it hurts.
NEUT29|Can sell equity in a bankrupt company.
NEUT30|Why can't carnival so stock at 18 they sold us on an 8 and a sovereign fund bought a ton and I mean this is time Carnival should announce this right now.
NEUT31|Right now on our show and priced at 16.
NEUT32|Get it done.
NEUT33|Maybe we get it 15 and then they give us and then you'll be able to figure that by that point.
NEUT34|Maybe we have Moderna.
NEUT35|Had they sold any stock today at Moderna, I haven't looked yet.
NEUT36|You get one of these vaccines.
NEUT37|I know by the way, we haven't really talked about the virus itself, Jim and or where we stand.
NEUT38|You know US cases 2.163 million deaths 100 and 17,000.
BULL39|Arizona I think had more new cases yesterday than the entire Northeast.
NEUT40|If I'm not incorrect.
NEUT41|There is some concern out there, Jim.
NEUT42|And it's not about grit.
NEUT43|You're not tougher than we are.
NEUT44|OK, that's not why we got it.
NEUT45|"It's not a matter of it's a matter of contagion, it's tag you're it with this disease."""
