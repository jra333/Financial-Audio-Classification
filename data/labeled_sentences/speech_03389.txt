NEUT0|"""Hi there, Jason Moser Reynolds with Motley Fool one thanks again for joining us for another edition of Ask a fool today we're taking a question from RR asks how do I invest $100 to gain $1000 in Romeo and that's a good question."
NEUT1|I think your key in on something that is fundamental to our approach to investing is fools.
NEUT2|Here you'll see, I'm sure on our website every now and then the tag line up there says get rich slowly.
NEUT3|We are investors that take very much the long term into consideration.
NEUT4|We focus on investing for years at a time.
NEUT5|Three, five years, even indefinitely.
NEUT6|Really, we love to find those companies that we can hang onto forever.
NEUT7|Let me try to put this into context.
NEUT8|As far as the numbers go.
NEUT9|Now, if I bought a share of a stock for $100 and over the course of the next five years, that's stock doubled.
NEUT10|So I had that share of stock was now $200 that would represent about 15% annualized returns over the course of those five years.
BULL11|Now that is a great return.
NEUT12|That's a wonderful target they have in mind and it's, you know, kind of the way we look at it.
NEUT13|Stocks here when we look at the stocks were picking for our services.
NEUT14|We like to see the stocks that would give us 15% annualized returns.
BULL15|That's just a phenomenal return.
NEUT16|So when you look at something like you're trying to go from 100 to $1000, well, that's not something that just happens overnight.
NEUT17|It's something that happens over the course of time, 567 maybe 10 years.
BULL18|But if it takes that long, it's certainly still a very successful investment.
NEUT19|My suspicion is you may from time to time see stocks that make headlines that stock jumps 50% of 1% of that stuff happens.
NEUT20|The problem is it's not so easy to figure out when it's going to happen.
NEUT21|It's tantamount to market timing really, and it's just it's not a sustainable investing strategy.
NEUT22|So rather than focus on turning your $100 into $1000, focus on investing money into the market regularly.
NEUT23|Make sure you have money that you can part with for at least five years, and then focus on buying quality businesses.
NEUT24|That have real business models that continue to bring in real money and grow that money over time.
NEUT25|And I think what you'll find there is a long term investor.
NEUT26|You'll be able to sleep better at night knowing that your money is in quality businesses and you know when you wake up 510 years later.
BULL27|I think you'll see that money has grown quite substantially.
NEUT28|It may not grow to $1000 from $100 a night, but it will happen the longer you stay in the market.
NEUT29|So focus on being a long term investor.
NEUT30|Great question.
