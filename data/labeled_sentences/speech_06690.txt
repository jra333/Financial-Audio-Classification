NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
NEUT1|Today will be looking at WTI oil futures on the four hour chart.
BULL2|So zooming in we can see that WTI oil futures appears to be sustaining.
BULL3|It's very short term bearish picture despite the oscillators currently reflecting an improvement in positive momentum.
NEUT4|Further aiding the move South or the downward sloping 2050 and 100.
NEUT5|Simple moving averages and their bearish crossovers of the 200.
NEUT6|S Ma.
BULL7|The short term oscillators display a rising positive momentum for now.
BULL8|Noteworthy though, is the restrictive trendline and the location of the RSI and the Mac D, which signaled that a revival of the decline could unfold if sellers pick up.
BEAR9|In case of more losses than 52.44 support and the fresh 3 1/2 month low of 52.12 could challenge the Bears steering underneath the low.
BEAR10|The more important region of 50.98 from 3rd of October 2019 to 50.51 from 7th of August 2019, which also encapsulates the June 2019 traps, could hold a further sell off towards the 49.59 barrier.
NEUT11|Alternatively, if bias.
NEUT12|Push higher first resistance would come at the 53.68 level ahead of the 20.
NEUT13|S Ma at 54.12.
BEAR14|Next, the downward sloping trendline around the inside swing low of 54.75 could interrupt the test of the 55.52 resistance, which is the 23.6% fibo Nachi.
NEUT15|Retracement of the down leg from 65.61 to 52.12.
NEUT16|Overcoming this, the 50.
BEAR17|SMAP at 56.54 could detur the price, testing the 38.2% fibo or 57.29.
BEAR18|Overall, the very short term bias is bearish and a dive below the 50.51 low could see a sell off unfold in oil futures.
NEUT19|That's it from me.
BULL20|"Have a great trading day."""
