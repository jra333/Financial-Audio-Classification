NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol BA."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day in this one, not only from the price action standpoint but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT8|May you know won't make this chart look the absolute best going forward, and that would be the price can say up above 225.
NEUT9|Now.
NEUT10|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 225.
BULL11|I'm not saying the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line here comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to just gauging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT15|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher when the Bulls run full health.
NEUT16|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT17|His visualize that.
NEUT18|That is what has been presented against and above 225 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT19|As long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT20|Not to squeeze down the charter quite a bit 'cause it has been a long time since the price went up this high, but next key, overarching level of resistance, watch very closely going to be right up there at the 232 mark and then of 232 can be broken next key level after that right up there around the 236 mark.
NEUT21|So overall keep around those couple areas moving forward.
NEUT22|But anyway look at it.
NEUT23|Monster movement today, monster volume.
NEUT24|So let's see how this one continues to play out for Boeing.
NEUT25|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT26|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT31|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT35|And I'll show you how it all works.
