NEUT0|"""Let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|You can see from this daily chart here I performed a green candle.
NEUT2|This green candle with above the last candle here so we can see from this daily chart.
NEUT3|Now April had formed a.
NEUT4|Round bottom short term.
NEUT5|Here, so the bottom has a low of 103 dot.
BEAR6|10 but if we check the volume here, we can see for users volume the volume is smaller than yes than the day before yesterday.
BEAR7|So here the volume is going down, so it's not a good sign for Apple stock.
NEUT8|It means the.
NEUT9|Upset momentum is not so strong, so in my opinion.
BEAR10|It's still likely for Apple stock to retreat to retest the supporting of the year may so it is still possible for Apple to drop back to 114.14 and also if Apple drop down again, it's very likely.
NEUT11|It formed a secondary top here, so this is the top.
NEUT12|This is the secondary top.
NEUT13|So it's very dangerous, so I for Apple, and if we change the.
NEUT14|The chart to weekly chart we can see here.
NEUT15|Apple stock actually House 3.
NEUT16|Red candle in the weekly chart and now it try to bounce back from the bottom here this green candle and this.
BEAR17|Small dodgy here for this week is very weak because we can see the buying power is so small it's not enough to support the stock going higher.
NEUT18|So in my opinion.
NEUT19|Here could be the secondary top and it need to drop back again to test the law here.
NEUT20|So let's wait and see what will happen today is Friday.
NEUT21|Today the US trading time begin will show us was the direction for the iPod stock.
BULL22|"Thank you."""
