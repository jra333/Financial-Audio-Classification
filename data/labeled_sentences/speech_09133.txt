NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a disappointing day today.
NEUT5|Not because it was super bearish or anything like that, but you know, for those of you that watch the video I did on this one on Thursday, it was looking like a very real possibility as the price was up around here that you know what.
BULL6|Maybe, just maybe the price was getting ready to break up to the upside of this sideways channel.
NEUT7|But we got that answer that answer that question answered there we go very quickly this morning when the price gap down and then never even got up to that range again.
NEUT8|So what was looking like a very realistic breakout potential that just didn't transpire?
NEUT9|At all now, like I said, it's not like the price came down here.
NEUT10|Now.
BEAR11|Would have been really bad.
NEUT12|It said the price gap down come down and then just blast it down through that area of support.
NEUT13|That didn't happen either, but the more of the story here is.
NEUT14|Nothing is really changed, meaning the price is still stuck between the sideways channel which I've talked about.
NEUT15|Basically all week long, so I get it.
NEUT16|I know I probably sound like a broken record at this point, but I mean that's literally all you can talk about right now.
NEUT17|Is that this thing is just continuing to chop back and forth between the channel?
NEUT18|So what are the actual bounds of the channel with the top part of the channel resistance right up there at 123 fifty and then the bottom pipe part of the channel that support down there at 1:21?
NEUT19|So really it's just a question.
NEUT20|Going into next week of who is ultimately going to win out?
NEUT21|'cause that's what's going on.
NEUT22|It's a battle right now.
NEUT23|Battle between the Bulls and the Bears.
NEUT24|So who's going to win out?
NEUT25|Are the Bulls gonna win out with a break out to the upside of the channel or the bear is going to win out with the breaks to the downside of the channel, so that's the big question mark.
NEUT26|Going into next week.
NEUT27|But until we really get that data, there's not much else that can be set over then.
NEUT28|Yeah, 30 minute sideways channel pattern and you gotta just wait and see how the price is going to behave.
NEUT29|Who is ultimately going to win out on the battle, so we'll see if we can get that answer or not.
NEUT30|Next week First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT32|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT33|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR38|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
