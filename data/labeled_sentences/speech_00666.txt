BULL0|"""Just looking through these numbers out from target and the numbers are very strong both on the top and the bottom line."
NEUT1|Let's run through this earnings per share on an adjusted basis.
BULL2|The retailer came in with earnings of $2.67 St, was looking for $2.54, so that's a 13 cent beat revenue.
BULL3|Also better than anticipated 28.34 billion versus the 27.4 billion the street was looking for.
NEUT4|So again, that's close to a billion dollars of a beat on that front to comp store sales comps.
BULL5|Up 20 1/2 percent 20.5% if you're looking at just the stores that was up by 6.9% and then digital.
BULL6|If you count that in up by 118% and then same day services, those are things like when you drive up and you pick up your order or shipped where they bring it to you same day up 212% for those services and that's really been the big growth that we've seen year over year they've been doing that every quarter over the last year been growing really significantly.
NEUT7|You gotta wonder how much those services are going to stick after the fact.
NEUT8|People use this, they find out it's convenient.
NEUT9|Do they stay with it once stores reopen?
NEUT10|That's certainly the hope I'm sure of target.
NEUT11|Check this out.
BEAR12|Shares right now down by about $0.19.
NEUT13|Let me give you a couple other metrics.
BULL14|They say for the fourth quarter in terms of traffic, number of transactions that were there, up 6.5% the basket up by 13%.
BEAR15|So the traffic was a very significantly in the fourth quarter.
NEUT16|Also, in terms of market share, that's a pretty significant #2 they're talking about, like $9 billion that they've grown.
NEUT17|There's the terms of market share.
NEUT18|Becky, there's a true quotes that there's the true quote.
BEAR19|Thank you, I couldn't figure out why it was down 'cause this is strong numbers on every count, it just shows up by 1.6%.
NEUT20|OK, so there's that.
NEUT21|There's the trade first knee jerk reaction on some of these things.
BULL22|What you would anticipate shares up after better than stronger than expected numbers we had seen already guys.
NEUT23|The numbers for November and December when they gave us the sales preview that we had seen for those two months.
BEAR24|But these trends look like they continued all the way through January, and that's unusual.
BEAR25|Usually a retailer will slow down the January watching those trends continue in January leads you to wonder what happened.
BEAR26|Now the company is pulling.
NEUT27|Its guidance is not going to give guidance like we heard from Home Depot and other retailers saying they just don't know what it's going to look like.
NEUT28|This year with Kovid.
NEUT29|After you go back to shopping more in the stores, maybe less on line.
NEUT30|Who knows which of these habits are going to stick?
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
