NEUT0|"""Stephen, I'll just start with you."
BULL1|You say your industrials diffusion index is in the midst of an unprecedented bull run now, notching nine straight positive readings.
NEUT2|Does that give you any sign as to what we can expect in the future?
BULL3|Yeah, I mean, I think we're set up for something at least as good as the Super cycle that we saw at the end of the last decade.
NEUT4|You know, the again, it's an unprecedented bull run.
NEUT5|We do this monthly.
BULL6|We've been doing it for almost 10 years and we've never seen it as strong as it is now.
NEUT7|Why is it been so strong?
BEAR8|I think it's a combination of the fact that we actually had a fair amount of weakness in industrials.
BEAR9|In 2018, nineteen, and then obviously 2020 was terrible, so there's a lot of pent up replacement demand.
BULL10|But just as important, we've had huge amounts of stimulus, very easy money that looks like it's going to continue.
NEUT11|So it's really kind of the perfect storm, I think.
NEUT12|Nicole, how where are margins here as a as an ongoing concern?
NEUT13|Whether it's regarding logistics and shipping or commodity prices.
NEUT14|Yeah, sure, so we actually published a lot on that theme.
NEUT15|I think probably the biggest concern of investors right now.
BULL16|Focuses on, you know, steel costs which are up well over 100% year to date.
BULL17|Reaching new highs as well as freight costs which you know very visibly up a lot this year.
NEUT18|So our view though, is that the volume growth kind of Steve's point is going to be so significant that sure there will be some commodity inflation impact on margins, but the incremental margins from higher volumes will eclipse that, and it's not going to make a big.
NEUT19|A big difference when it comes to margin performance for the full year.
NEUT20|Patient out of tecan into cyclicals like industrials right now, in many ways a lot of the industrial companies have adopted their own technology, their own digitisation, their own ability to offer services on the manufacturing side, for example, how big is the opportunity there and what are the names that investors should be looking at.
NEUT21|If you see this as a long term meaningful opportunity.
NEUT22|Steven oh sorry, yeah, I mean I 100% agree.
NEUT23|I mean technology comes in much more slowly in our world and in the tech world, but when it hits, it really makes a big difference and I guess I would call out John Deere as kind of a really good example of 1 where farm technology is now gotten to the point where farmers are driving significant yield gains by using it.
NEUT24|They're willing to pay for it.
BULL25|It's certainly adding to deers growth and it's something that's going to continue for the foreseeable future.
NEUT26|Shepard Smith here.
