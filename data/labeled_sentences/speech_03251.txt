BEAR0|"""Sometimes stocks deliver incredibly high performance every year."
BEAR1|Some stocks may rise in price by 100 or 200%, but with thousands of stocks to choose from, it's challenging to spot which might deliver high performance before it happens.
NEUT2|After all, no one can predict the future.
NEUT3|That's why some investors choose to use relative strength analysis that can help them identify potentially high performing stocks.
NEUT4|Relative strength compares the stocks performance to the broader market.
NEUT5|This can help investors determine which stocks are currently outperforming.
NEUT6|Most investors define the broader market as the S&P 500 because it's the most widely followed stock index.
NEUT7|And a wide representation of the US stock market.
NEUT8|So how does this relate to relative strength?
NEUT9|Basically it works like this.
BEAR10|Relative strength analysis assumes if a stock is outperforming the S&P 500, it could continue outperforming in the future.
BULL11|Relative strength usually rises when a company's fundamentals improve due to increasing sales, beating earnings estimates, or releasing any product.
BULL12|These fundamental drivers, along with the investors expectations for increasing sales and earnings, generally lead to rising relative strength in the stock.
NEUT13|While some might think that relative strength only applies to bullish markets.
BULL14|A stock can potentially have high relative strength in all market conditions.
NEUT15|When the S&P 500 is bullish.
NEUT16|Consider looking for stocks that are outperforming or beating the index.
NEUT17|For example, take Netflix starting in 2009.
BULL18|Shares of Netflix were up a lot relative to the S&P 500 and over the next year.
BEAR19|Shares of Netflix continue to deliver high performance relative to the S&P 500 until 2011, when the market turns bearish.
NEUT20|You can also identify stocks with high relative strength.
NEUT21|The difference in a bearish market is that you can look for stocks that are outperforming.
BEAR22|Or falling less than the S&P 500 when the market starts moving higher.
BEAR23|Stocks that performed better during the bear market may be more likely to outperform the index.
NEUT24|Let's run through an example using Amgen starting in April 2012.
BEAR25|Shares of Amgen fell less than the S&P 500 when the market turned around and headed higher in November.
BULL26|Shares of Amgen rose more than the S&P 500.
BULL27|These bullish and bearish examples demonstrate how relative strength analysis can help identify potentially high performing investments.
NEUT28|In both examples.
NEUT29|The stocks.
BULL30|Significantly outperformed the S&P 500, but that's not always the case.
NEUT31|When using relative strength analysis, the fundamental factors that lead to high relative strength in the 1st place can change an impera stocks performance.
BEAR32|For instance, a new product might be a flop and cause a company to lose money, resulting in relative weakness just like any other form of analysis.
NEUT33|There's no guarantee of success when using relative strength.
NEUT34|That's why it can be important to help manage risk by diversifying Holdings.
NEUT35|Now that you know the potential benefits and risks involved with this analysis.
NEUT36|Let's discuss how you can use it to find stocks to start regularly, measure the performance of stocks in your existing portfolio or watch list against the performance of the S&P 500.
BEAR37|Remember, you're looking for stocks that are outperforming.
BULL38|If the index is in a bullish trend or holding up better if the index is in a bearish trend.
NEUT39|If you already own a stock with high relative strength, you might want to consider holding on to it.
NEUT40|If you don't already own the stock, consider it a candidate and add it to your watchlist.
NEUT41|Additionally, you can search for stocks with high relative strength by using a stock Screener.
NEUT42|A stock Screener can help you search for stocks with high relative strength and other characteristics such as fundamentals, valuation, dividends and others.
NEUT43|"Whether you use a Screener to find stocks or simply monitor your portfolio and watchlist using relative strength analysis can be a helpful technique for identifying potentially high performing stocks."""
