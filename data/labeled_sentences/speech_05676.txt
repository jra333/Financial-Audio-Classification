NEUT0|"""Welcome to the quick stocks virtual portfolio."
BEAR1|Today's recommendation is Disney is a powerhouse that is tanked on their most recent earnings.
BEAR2|Miss ESPN flopping and some uncertainty about Disney's most recent streaming service announcement, but the strong pipeline of Star Wars and Marvel movies.
NEUT3|Disney won't be going away anytime soon.
BULL4|I think the Disney streaming service will actually be a huge hit and right now Disney is available at a huge discount price with a strong dividend and a strong future outlook.
BULL5|This is a strong buy.
NEUT6|Here's how the portfolio is doing today.
