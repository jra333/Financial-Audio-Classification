NEUT0|"""He is calling this via video chart on ticker symbol."
NEUT1|TSL, a Tesla.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, I'm in the state, the obvious, but I will anyways to build context.
BULL6|Very impressive movement today.
BULL7|Price gap down got actually all the way down to that area and then from there ultimately was able to close all the way back up to where it did.
NEUT8|So very nice move.
NEUT9|Yeah, there's still more work to be done, but my point here is from where the price was.
BULL10|It was able to close that good move, but that does bring about the valid question of.
NEUT11|But is there any sort of true power behind this one?
NEUT12|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT13|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT14|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves on a single area.
NEUT15|In that area is right there at 6:25 Y 625 so important, and I'm not saying this was going to happen, but for explanations they give the price were to come down here, behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT16|What would that be doing with the price?
NEUT17|That would quite literally be put in the price.
NEUT18|Right back inside of that range where it just was, I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like go back to where they were not exactly Santa true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT19|But to be fair, no price goes straight up, so maybe the price does come down here.
NEUT20|Behave in that manner and then start to work the way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there you have Lowe's right there and if you envision each one of those stair steps, well hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's an in the game.
BULL22|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT23|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined.
NEUT24|At 6:25 in terms of areas of resistance moving forward.
NEUT25|First key battleground going to watch very closely right up there.
NEUT26|Around $644 and the next key level.
NEUT27|After that it's going to be that purple line up there.
NEUT28|The 50.
NEUT29|Moving average currently valid it.
NEUT30|Let's just call it $660.00.
NEUT31|So keep around these couple areas moving forward.
NEUT32|But All in all.
NEUT33|Anyway, look at it.
BULL34|Very nice bounce today on the price, not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this bonds moving forward.
NEUT35|Let's see what happens.
NEUT36|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT38|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL39|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR42|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT47|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT48|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT49|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT50|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT51|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
