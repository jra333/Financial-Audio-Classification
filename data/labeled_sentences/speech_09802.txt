BULL0|"""We got big news."
BEAR1|GameStop was up more than 300% again so the shares climbed rapidly and were halted twice for volatility ahead of the closing Bell Wednesday.
BULL2|The gaming retailers stock is currently priced at $108.00 up nearly 104% from the previous averages.
NEUT3|And if you're wondering what the F just happened, you're definitely not the only one in this video, we're going to break down exactly what made the stock go up so much, and whether it's a potential buy again.
BULL4|In all seriousness, if we are able to get the old highs again, we're talking about another potential 300% from where we are right now.

NEUT8|OK, without further ado, let's start by talking about why the stock is up so much again.
BEAR9|So as most of us know, the surge comes about a month after a Wild games top trading frenzy caused its stock to jump around 1600% in a matter of days, though it quickly fell from highs around $350.00.
BEAR10|The late January surge was fueled by individual retail investors, many from the Reddit page wallstreetbets, some of whom believed the GameStop was undervalued, and others who wanted to squeeze hedge funds that had shorted the stock.
BULL11|The newest jump in games Top also comes a day after the company announced its Chief Financial Officer would resign next month to help accelerate Gamestops transformation, which could fuel investors who believe in the long term value of the retailer and its ability to shift from relying on physical stores to an E Commerce sales model.
NEUT12|What also eventually happened is another mini short squeeze.
BEAR13|So after all time highs in January, short interest dropped to a point where only about 40% of the float was shorted.
NEUT14|As of January 29, more recent data isn't available yet.
BEAR15|To know what it is exactly today, but the decline in short interest appeared to mark the end of the GameStop saga.
BEAR16|The stock fell roughly 90% from peak eyes, except apparently everyone simply regrouped for round two.
BULL17|Traders were out in full force late this afternoon, bidding games Top Stock back up.
BULL18|To be clear, 40% short interest is still significant enough to spark that many short squeeze.
NEUT19|And it's possible that shorts decided to short GameStop again, thinking it was all over.
BULL20|After all, the stock was still trading more than 10 times where it traded before.
NEUT21|All of this began.
BULL22|His short interest has increased any since January 29.
NEUT23|Then this could be a wild ride yet again.
NEUT24|This of course, leads us to the question whether GameStop is a buy again.
NEUT25|So should you put your money back in the stock trying to ride the momentum?
NEUT26|And what does the future look like?
NEUT27|Well, sadly, humanity can't predict the future yet.
NEUT28|But what we can do is making assumptions based on historical data and look at what happened in January.
BEAR29|And last time we got restrictions, many games top bulls felt cheated because of the trading restrictions.
NEUT30|Robin Hood and other brokerages put on the stock.
BEAR31|In a recent interview with Dave Portnoy, Robin Hood CEO said it moved to restrict trading because it feared an impending liquidity issue.
NEUT32|If it didn't act.
BULL33|Since then, the company has raised a lot of money, seemingly mitigating this risk considering all the negative press it received last time.
NEUT34|It's fair to wonder if Robin Hood would restrict the buying of GameStop stock again, if it doesn't, it will be interesting to watch just how high GameStop stock Conflit.
NEUT35|So if you want to buy, be careful of the risk and watch your position size alright with that being it for today's video.
