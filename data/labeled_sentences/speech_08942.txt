BEAR0|"""Well, now we're seeing shares trading pretty flat ahead of its quarterly report that is coming out after the Bell."
BULL1|The company expected to get a big lift from the iPhone 12 cycle.
BULL2|Sales expected to grow 12%, according to FactSet.
NEUT3|Let's bring in Dan Hally for the very latest on that front.
NEUT4|And then what are you hearing right now in terms of how significant this most recent upgrade cycle will be?
NEUT5|Yeah, this is a kind of been the thing that adelus have been talking about for quite a long time to suppose super cycle of sales of the iPhone, you know Dan Ives over at Wedbush likes to quote that.
BEAR6|And that seems to be what analysts are expecting this quarter with a potentially record quarter for them.
NEUT7|And you know, it looks like for iPhone sales, Bloomberg is estimating around $60.33 billion for iPhone sales revenue.
NEUT8|But also the wearables category making up 11.84 billion.
NEUT9|And that includes everything from.
NEUT10|At the Apple Watch 2 Airpods.
NEUT11|It also includes the home pod and the new $500 Airpods Max.
NEUT12|Those over ear headphones and then services.
NEUT13|Obviously the big thing that we usually like to talk about that includes everything from Apple Music to Apple TV +2 I cloud and warranties that is expected to bring in 14.89 billion, so it could definitely be a record setting quarter for the company and this is again been something that's been predicted for quite awhile.
NEUT14|A 5G iPhone.
NEUT15|New designs of four different offerings.
BULL16|Though the iPhone 12 Mini doesn't appear to be selling as well as was hoped, but the the standard iPhone in the larger ones are doing incredibly well.
BULL17|And I mean, I guess you know it would be positive signs going into earnings with all those strengths to point out on the iPhone front.
NEUT18|Obviously traditionally very important for Apple, but as we've talked about services seems to be weighing more and more heavy.
NEUT19|Each earnings report we get here.
NEUT20|So I mean Holly, when you look at that, what more would you expect to hear on?
NEUT21|Maybe some of these pushes that has certainly caught icacos on when we look at Apple Fitness.
NEUT22|Yeah, I think, oh hey, look Apple Fitness is great Apple Fitness.
NEUT23|Plus I was using it.
NEUT24|I got to review it.
NEUT25|I I loved it and I think that is really going to be what you know continues to be a major catalyst for the company.
BEAR26|iPhone sales are doing great right now but don't forget there are, you know not a few quarters ago we were talking about how iPhone sales were flat or how iPhone sales were falling from their previous high.
NEUT27|So expect services to continue to be a major major point that people like to focus on.
NEUT28|"Alright, well we'll be watching that when it comes out in highly appreciate it."""
