BULL0|"""I think it's been a long bull market from the March lows, but our next guest says it's time to be taking some profits."
NEUT1|He's Bill Strazzullo, the chief market strategist strategist at Bell Curve trading, joining us from our Boston Bureau and Bill.
BULL2|Great to have you with us back on the program.
NEUT3|The City News looks like it's over hanging on the market right now, so today may be the day that you do take some money off the table.
NEUT4|Well, Betty, our game plan really hasn't changed for months.
BEAR5|We've been bullish looking for move to 11111 fifty.
NEUT6|I talked about that before we even hit 1000 in the S&P and now we're there.
NEUT7|So what we're telling our clients is you really want to be in the harvest mode?
BULL8|Take some profit, take a step back and begin to wind direct with exposure doesn't mean we can't press higher in the short term, but the more important point here is that in our opinion, the risk reward is really shifted, meaning the risk of what we stand to lose by holding a long position or is least is great.
BULL9|If not greater than what we can reasonably make on the upside, so we're telling our clients it's time to dial it back and begin to take some money off the table.
NEUT10|Bill, what are you telling your clients in terms of the dollars turn around?
BULL11|Is it good news or bad news for the equity market, given that the dollar is no longer a barometer of risk, it's kind of a reflection of improving economic fundamentals.
BEAR12|Good question, but I mean clearly if you go back to the March lows, you know as the equity markets were beginning to bottom and move higher, the dollar was starting to fall and now we see that relationship going in the reverse direction.
BEAR13|The dollar is getting stronger and stocks are getting weaker.
NEUT14|So it's definitely something to keep an eye on and so we're not surprised to see that in fact, if there is a surprise trade in 2010, what we've told our clients is that surprise trade would be a major rally in the dollar meaning.
NEUT15|That has that is a trade that has potentially the opportunity to catch a lot of investors going the wrong way, and the question now is has that trend toward dollar strength already started?
NEUT16|Hey Bill, it's Adam.
NEUT17|Let me jump in here for guys at home who are sitting on some good games.
NEUT18|Obviously you're telling him to sell, but does that mean you sell a little bit of everything?
NEUT19|Or do you just sell some of the losers already actually saw some of the big winners?
NEUT20|What do you tell guys at home, right?
NEUT21|I think for the reality of people who are watching this show look.
BEAR22|In 2008 they got crushed.
BEAR23|You know the IR A's 401K is down 40 fifty 60%.
NEUT24|In 2009.
BULL25|They've got a nice bump off the March lows.
NEUT26|What I would suggest for somebody watching this show is maybe move 30 or 40% of your assets to cash.
NEUT27|That way if the market if we're wrong in the market, goes higher, you'll still participate on the upside.
BULL28|But if I'm right and we do begin a move lower, you have at least protected some of your gains bill.
NEUT29|I mean, you do like some things in the markets right now, or some of the sectors.
NEUT30|You have been before you like some parts of retail energy.
NEUT31|What would you pick up right now though on this on this on the sell off.
NEUT32|I, I think Betty would probably looks best right now to us if I had to pick a sector, as in was probably the SMH.
BULL33|The semis that looks good to us.
BULL34|I mean on the way up tech was clearly the strongest.
BEAR35|If you look at the S&P, Dow and NASDAQ, the NASDAQ was clearly the outperformance.
NEUT36|So that's where the strength in the market has been and that probably continues to be the strongest part of the market.
BULL37|Even if we begin to move lower here.
NEUT38|So that's probably where I'd stay if I had to be in the market.
BULL39|OK Bill, good to talk with you.
BULL40|Thanks for joining us.
