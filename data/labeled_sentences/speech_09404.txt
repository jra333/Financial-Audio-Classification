NEUT0|"""I also got a little boy will back in the video."
NEUT1|This video will be about check Cap stock, ticker, symbol, CHD K and I'll give you guys.
NEUT2|My analyst and prediction on this stock as you guys know I am holding the stock longer term but I do want to start playing it shorter term so intraday plays so it could be just within the day or it could be within a day or two or three right?
NEUT3|So I'll have the longer term position just holding right long term.
BULL4|As I am bullish on the stock longer term, I do think it is about to have a rally in it.
BEAR5|It's been trading sideways for a very long time.
NEUT6|Not a little bit, so if it rains sideways for a very long time since January 6th, so that has been a long time.
NEUT7|And I do think it is about to pop.
NEUT8|So I gave you all this support level as it was coming up to come down.
NEUT9|It was going to hold this as support as you can tell this level was at 173.
BEAR10|And the low came in at 171, so only 0.02 cents off.
NEUT11|Almost perfect came down here again.
NEUT12|It rejected it right?
BULL13|So this is holding up price very good.
NEUT14|That's what I like to see and these are just old supports and this is the last defense.
NEUT15|Now whenever I say last defense, that just means if price breaks it then I turn very short term OK?
NEUT16|So these levels help perfectly.
NEUT17|As you can tell, look out look at all the times it hit this level, right?
NEUT18|Look at all these times, then trade it right through it.
NEUT19|These are key key key key levels.
NEUT20|I can't stress that enough.
NEUT21|These are very key levels so this level was at 173 this level 159.
NEUT22|This level 154 and this 173 area is very key.
NEUT23|You wanted to hold this price right?
BEAR24|You want to hold this price and we can allow price to drop all the way to about 165.
NEUT25|So it can trade between 165 this level and up.
NEUT26|It can come down here.
NEUT27|That's fine.
NEUT28|Nothing to worry about and then it.
BEAR29|But if it starts coming down here back to these levels, then I'll be watching the stock a little harder because it came down these levels a lot of times and I'm afraid it might be a little weak.
NEUT30|OK, so it might fall through the long.
BULL31|This stays above this level and above 165 I think would be good for the longer term and I do see prices going over $3.
BULL32|OK so hope you guys like this video.
NEUT33|Recommendation Tobias said anything this medication purposes only, so do not trade anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one.
NEUT34|"Bye."""
