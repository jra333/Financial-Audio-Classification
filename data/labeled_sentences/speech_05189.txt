BULL0|"""Welcome to chart of the day."
NEUT1|I'm Nico Eizik, Amazon stock, and the offensive Lineman of Eliot analysis.
NEUT2|On April 23rd, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson gave $12,000 in Amazon stock to each one of the 13 members of his defensive line.
BULL3|Wilson's gift was a show of appreciation to his teammates, who, he said.
NEUT4|Quote sacrificed your physical and mental well being to protect me as they go to battle every Sunday and quote in finance.
BEAR5|Market traders face grueling battles of their own.
NEUT6|Their goal is to protect the well being of their portfolios via trades that succeed.
NEUT7|Even as they avoid serious financial injury.
NEUT8|So how can traders best accomplish this?
NEUT9|Well, Elliott Wave analysis stands formidable line to protect the well being of traders.
NEUT10|Consider, for example, Amazon stock in the fall of 2018.
BEAR11|Amazon is falling hard and it's a broader landslide in Fang stocks.
BEAR12|So for traders who follow Amazon, the play was to anticipate a likely bottom for the tech giant share price.
NEUT13|Obviously to pull that playoff is.
NEUT14|Easier said than done.
NEUT15|Wrote one October 29th Bloomberg quote.
NEUT16|How low can they go?
NEUT17|That's the question for traders looking at some of Wall Street's largest technology and Internet stocks.
NEUT18|People keep calling bottoms, getting her.
NEUT19|They're trying to catch falling knives.
NEUT20|End Quote.
NEUT21|Yet one day after that article, Elliott Wave instructor Jeffrey Kennedy's October 30th Traders Classroom lesson, offered a way to gauge Amazon's downside potential and help control risk.
NEUT22|Jeffrey pinpointed that area in Amazon and said this in his October 30th lesson.
NEUT23|We're now back into the span of the prior 4th wave, but I would like to point out just a few things.
NEUT24|Sometimes characteristics of how price action resolves or unfolds whenever you have a triangle in a fourth wave position.
NEUT25|If you have five waves up and done, you're going to be looking for prices to come back to add or near the prior 4th Wave Extreme, but a lot of times whenever you're working a triangle, it's not uncommon to see prices go all the way back to the wave.
NEUT26|The extreme of the actual triangle pattern, which would be 1265.9.
NEUT27|So Simply put, I think moving forward, it actually might be most prudent to continue to look a little bit lower, possibly down to the 1550% retracement.
NEUT28|Give a little bit lower into these lows that we saw in, say, February March of 2018.
BULL29|I think that's where we have really good solid structural support.
NEUT30|I think we probably have another 100 bucks or maybe even 200 bucks to the downside.
NEUT31|And Amazon.
NEUT32|From there, Amazon continued its sell off into late December, just as Jeffrey anticipated the second play and Amazon came a few months later after a lengthy sideways trend in his March 21st Traders classroom, Jeffrey Revisited Amazon in this clip.
NEUT33|From that lesson, you can hear him explain exactly why looking for new highs was a quote, no brainer.
NEUT34|The narrative we discussed is unfolding quite nicely back into the prior 4th Wave Extreme.
NEUT35|Remember, we talked about the wave a extreme of the running triangle.
BULL36|That this area would provide support.
NEUT37|I think this is a no brainer.
NEUT38|I'm looking up.
NEUT39|I'm looking for new highs an Amazon from their Amazon sword, right in line with Jeffers Elliott Wave play in his letter of gratitude to his teammates Russell Wilson said quote, I wanted to give you something that had a lasting impact, something that would affect the lives of you, your family, and your children.
NEUT40|And quote for traders on the battlefield of financial markets.
