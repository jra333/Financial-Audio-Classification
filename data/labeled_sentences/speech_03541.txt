NEUT0|"""I would like Yahoo Finance live on this Monday morning."
BULL1|All three majors are getting the green stocks continuing to climb.
BULL2|We are about to cross the one year anniversary of the absolute covid era market bottom Brian Sozzi.
NEUT3|That means there is one word that everyone wants to say.
NEUT4|Begins with the B rhymes with double Goldman Sachs writing about it over the weekend.
NEUT5|What's the deal?
NEUT6|Well, it's not Brian, it's a it's bubble.
NEUT7|In this case, Miles and this is a very long, extensive nodata.
NEUT8|Peter Oppenheimer at Goldman Sachs, this type of no.
NEUT9|Just bookmark and you go back to when you think about it during the week.
NEUT10|So I plan to have more on this as the week unfolds, But anyway, this is Oppenheimer saying he does not think there is a bubble right now, despite more people searching on Google, the word bubble, and we have that chart here you can see more people now searching for the word bubble, which coincides with the market rally.
NEUT11|But Oppenheimer says no.
NEUT12|We're not in a bubble and you list some some pretty good reasons here and go.
NEUT13|First and foremost.
NEUT14|He says historically we have very low interest rates where you obviously you have people out there or you have investors out there taking risks but doesn't appear to be excessive risks, at least when it comes to stocks.
NEUT15|Next up, big companies, the big companies like the Big Cap Tech that is dominating that dominates the markets there dominating for reason points.
NEUT16|Onaman, hoppenheim aran.
NEUT17|One of those reasons is there dominating their sector and they're also producing large amounts of cash flow.
NEUT18|That's a lot different than we saw in late 1990s bubble where you had companies essentially training at stratospheric valuations and earning no money and with no prospects to earn more money.
NEUT19|At some point in the future.
NEUT20|Also to Oppenheimer says he's not seeing widespread excess ownership of stock, so that is an interesting point.
NEUT21|You know, considering what we did see with GameStop it with a lot of retail investors in January, February, and and I would argue we still continue to see it now again.
NEUT22|Oppenheimer not seeing excessive ownership of stocks and then last but not least.
NEUT23|Not seeing banks take really large risks when it comes to their balance sheets.
NEUT24|You know an I would agree with that.
NEUT25|You look at the bank balance sheets, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs.
NEUT26|Are they taking more risks?
NEUT27|Sure, but this is not the same type of risk profiles these companies were taken in 2008 in the late 1990s.
NEUT28|Yeah, look where will get outta here.
NEUT29|I think the bubble thing is fascinating because really, to me it comes from this place of, you know people want they want to be the next Michael Lewis book.
NEUT30|But guess what?
NEUT31|Even if you get the public alright.
NEUT32|Even if there were a bubble, you find going to be Michael Lewis book anyway.
BEAR33|And in general when markets go down a lot, most people lose money.
NEUT34|You hedge the markets that you lose less money than your peers in, you know, kind of bear event that we saw last spring.
NEUT35|But it's not like a huge moneymaker per say.
NEUT36|It can be on a very limited basis, but will table this conversation for a later time, right?
NEUT37|Brian Sozzi with really chart of the day.
BULL38|"I don't know if we're going to be better than putting the Tulip bubble, Mississippi level and Bitcoin in one place throughout the rest of this week."""
