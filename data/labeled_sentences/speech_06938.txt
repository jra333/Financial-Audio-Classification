NEUT0|"""So two things."
NEUT1|First, he said with falling asleep, stopping part.
NEUT2|I didn't say that I don't think we are forming a bottom yet.
BEAR3|I think we are going down at a slower week, so there's a very important distinction there.
NEUT4|When are we going to start forming a bottom when one of two things happen?
NEUT5|Either we get a really thoughtful.
BULL6|Alternatively, we get good news on the medical side and that good news.
NEUT7|It's starting to happen, but hasn't been critical.
NEUT8|Mass as to how you will feel?
NEUT9|Remember, I shared with you through this notion of wig.
NEUT10|Wet minimizations there's so much we don't know.
NEUT11|Joe, there's so much we don't know.
NEUT12|This is unprecedented.
NEUT13|That this is highly uncertain for investors, so you likely to make a mistake you don't want to make a mistake, but you likely to make a mistake.

NEUT16|I recover from easiest so for me it's very different than for other people.
NEUT17|I think the average investor, the mistake that counter forward is to be wiped out, because if you wiped out in a bankruptcy it doesn't come back.
NEUT18|Bankruptcies on capital destroying so my own for them.
NEUT19|I say you know what wait a little bit.
NEUT20|Yes you may miss the 1st 5% up but it's very hard to call.
NEUT21|This is a medical issue.
NEUT22|This is not a market issue, an economic issue.
NEUT23|Financial issues.
BEAR24|"This is a medical issue."""
