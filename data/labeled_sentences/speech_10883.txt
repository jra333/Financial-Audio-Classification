NEUT1|It just seems like more and more information just keeps on piling up in regard to Civ and Lucid Motors.
NEUT2|We have some more breaking news in regards to information that we were able to find on the Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT3|Shout out to Jean Grey or add to X8 NTHUSIA on Twitter and shout out to Alex Cutler for retweeting this.
NEUT4|But on February 11, 2021 at 7:20 PM.
NEUT5|So at the time I'm shooting this it's been about 30 minutes but since this was tweeted out.
NEUT6|CCTV new on the blue me Blue meaning Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT7|We have some new and more information that was updated now.
NEUT8|This information on the Bloomberg Terminal platform follows from a prior video that I literally just made in regard to other information that was posted on the Bloomberg Terminal platform.
NEUT9|I made a video on it literally just now, so I'd highly recommend you check that out.
NEUT10|But after this was posted at 5:06 PM where it says Venrock Associates proposed to sell lucid Motors.
NEUT11|Ink to Civ.
BEAR12|We have a diss.
NEUT13|Updated information where it talks about the merger between CC Ivy and Lucid, so it says a deal type M&A.
NEUT14|The announcement date is 1/11/2021.
NEUT15|Target name Lucid Motors and acquire name Churchill Capital Core 4 and the announced total value is $15 billion.
NEUT16|Payment type stock and deal status proposed now.
BEAR17|This is some very breaking and very huge news for us because this only just furthers the argument and just makes us more bullish.
NEUT18|That lucid ANSI Civ are going to be combining now.
NEUT19|I want to point you to this $15 billion announced total value, in particular because literally a month ago, an January 11, 2021, when Bloomberg posted at Lucid Motors, is in talks to list via Michael clients back.
NEUT20|It says a transaction could be valued at up to $15 billion.
