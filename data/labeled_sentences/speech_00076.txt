NEUT0|"""Today we're going through Neo versus Tesla or returns electric."
BULL1|Vehicle stocks have had a solid year as investors put a premium on growth stocks while betting that the disruption caused by the pandemic could make the shift to EVs harder for mainstream automakers.
BULL2|While Tesla TSL a + 1% stock, has soared by about 5X this year.
BULL3|Smaller players have benefited as well.
BULL4|China based luxury electric carmaker Nio NYSE Neo has seen its stock price soared by almost 6X year today.
BULL5|How do Tesla and Neo compare while both companies trade at a similar valuation with a price to sales multiple of about 13.5 X based on projected 2020 revenue, NEO is growing more quickly, but Tesla might be the safer back.
NEUT6|Here is the analysis Neo, which was founded in 2014, currently offers 3 premium electric vehicles which are priced starting at about 50K.
BULL7|Neo delivered close to 20 point 5K cars in 2019, marking an 81% year over year increase, and we expect the number to grow by about 85% this year.
BULL8|In comparison, Tesla's deliveries grew by 50% last year to 368 K vehicles, and we expect the number to rise by about 29% in 2020, driven by the launch of its Model Y and the opening of its Chinese factory.
BULL9|Neo is in the earlier phases of growth, with revenue expanding 56% last year.
BULL10|With growth likely to pick up to over 90% in 2020, Tesla sales grew by just 15% last year and could potentially pick up to 30% in 2020.
BEAR11|Neo's net margins remained deeply negative over 2019, at minus 146% with gross margins also remaining in the red.
BULL12|Things are getting better as sales ramp up as gross margins jumped from minus 12.2% in Q1 2020 to about to 8.4% in Q2 2020 and net margins are also likely to improve significantly in the near term.
BULL13|Tesla, on the other hand, is expected to post net margins of over 5% this year driven by improved deliveries, higher regulatory credit sales, and potentially higher software sales.
NEUT14|Tesla as the safer bet overall, while Neos faster recent growth, has battery as a service boss which allows customers to subscribe for car batteries rather than paying for them up front.
NEUT15|Or no doubt interesting.
BULL16|We think it remains a riskier investment compared to Tesla.
NEUT17|Neo is focused on the Chinese EV market.
NEUT18|Which is extremely competitive with several hundred players.
NEUT19|Scaling up production quickly is also not going to be an easy task.
BEAR20|For Neo, the company has also faced quality challenges in the past.
BEAR21|Last year it recalled about 5000 vehicles after reports of several fires, and it remains to be seen if it can scale up production while maintaining quality.
BULL22|While Tesla stock also looks somewhat expensive, the company's well established in desirable brand, its industry-leading tech and software differentiation.
BULL23|And fast improving profitability could offer a better margin of safety compared to Neo.
BULL24|Tesla's business model looks compelling and margins are poised to rise further driven by declining battery costs improved self-driving capabilities which could drive software sales and better operating leverage.
BULL25|Thanks for watching.
