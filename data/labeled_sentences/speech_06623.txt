NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to this technical analysis video here, the extended com."
NEUT1|It's Friday, July the 19th and today will be looking at the US dollar versus the Canadian currency.
NEUT2|Zooming into the daily chart.
BULL3|Now we can see that the market has been mostly stable this week.
BULL4|Facing resistance near the 20 day moving average and support around a new ten month low of one point 3015 in the short term, the pair is likely to hold neutral as long as the red tent concerning the blue.
BULL5|Can you send lines hold flat there is psych continues to gain ground.
NEUT6|What is 50 neutral market this week?
BULL7|And then Maggie keeps improving Tord Zero, suggesting a neutral picture as well, looking for resistance levels.
NEUT8|The 20 day moving average could control upside corrections, even know.
BEAR9|Then the next stop could be around one 3143 where the bullish action posts lately breaking this Level 2.
BULL10|Then we might see more gains towards 1.32 and one point 3228.
BEAR11|On the flip side, now closing price below 1.31 point 2970.
BULL12|Could open the way towards a former congested area between one point 2920 and 1.29 lower.
NEUT13|The 1.28 level could be of psychological importance and therefore another level to watch about the medium term picture.
BULL14|This seems to be more interesting given this week's bearish cross between the 50 and 200 day moving average, which is the first in two years and a signal.
BEAR15|But the bearish outlook in the medium term is likely to get even worse.
NEUT16|So that's all from me.
BULL17|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
