NEUT0|"""Well, let's get to the Trader rundown."
NEUT1|Tim bigham.
NEUT2|A Delta derivatives, joins me.
NEUT3|Now he is looking at all of the market action and a busy week.
NEUT4|We have going on, of course.
NEUT5|So let's take a look at what you want to talk about the most, which happens to be the NASDAQ, which could get interesting now that Apple's earnings are out.
NEUT6|Yeah, absolutely.
BEAR7|And we saw some bad earnings out of Google.
BULL8|Really good earnings out of Microsoft.
NEUT9|So kind of back and forth here.
NEUT10|Microsoft took over the largest market cap, will see if Apple can get back that number one spot, but I think.
BEAR11|NASDAQ, given the relative big outperformance we've seen over the past month or so, the fact that market has been performing really well, I think it's getting a little bit overextended here, like the fact that ball is down as well.
NEUT12|So I'm just going out and buying the June at the money Triple Q, put Sandy experts at the money puts just positioning for a pullback somewhere along the road here, hedging by selling some shorter term further out of the money, puts against it.
NEUT13|So that's really an option strategy for shorting the NASDAQ.
NEUT14|Absolutely, it's a guarded short here.
NEUT15|Certainly, given the way this.
NEUT16|Market is the momentum.
NEUT17|I wouldn't jump in front of the train and they actually short, but I like the fact that volatile, which means option prices are cheap so hasn't been this cost effective to take a short in a very long time.
NEUT18|Let's take a look at Disney.
NEUT19|Everybody's buzzing about this stack and it did have a big move initially off of The Avengers movie.
NEUT20|So would you play The Avengers theme in this stack?
NEUT21|I wouldn't play it anymore from here.
NEUT22|In fact, here again, I'm taking a guarded bearish stance.
NEUT23|We have earnings coming next week on May a so.
NEUT24|I'm buying at the money 138 puts that expire May 17th or traditionals selling them expertly.
NEUT25|Earnings month may 10135.
NEUT26|Puts paint about a bucket I have for that.
NEUT27|So really just looking for that.
NEUT28|Disney is the most expensive.
BEAR29|It's been on almost every metric overbought.
BULL30|Technically overvalued fundamentally.
BEAR31|Highest price and sales in 10 years and we finally saw the stock start to slow down two days ago.
BEAR32|We've made a new high reverse closed lower on the day.
NEUT33|I like to that price action that momentum.
NEUT34|Finally, might be broken on a really red hot stock an The Avengers can only take this so far, so that's your trade on Disney, but what about a long term buy on this stack?
NEUT35|Yeah, I would look to probably use that 130 level where a kind of you know, got going with the momentum.
NEUT36|I like the valuation down here.
NEUT37|JP Morgan came out with a note a couple of days ago looking for 6:50 in earnings next year so I can jump into that 20 times valuation.
NEUT38|But up around that 138 level we're looking at almost 22.
NEUT39|Getting a little bit.
NEUT40|Crazy on historic basis for Disney.
BULL41|I'm so glad you cover Disney.
NEUT42|Thanks so much for coming on this year at anytime and check out businessfirstam.com to find out where to see our entire show.
