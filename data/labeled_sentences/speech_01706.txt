NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to this new supply and demand stock analysis, this time for British Petroleum ticker BP."
NEUT1|This isn't reading this claim and you can pause the video and read it at anytime.
NEUT2|OK, let's pull up the weekly time frame on British Petroleum.
NEUT3|This is a weekly time frame.
NEUT4|Every single candle stick here represents a week worth of time.
BEAR5|OK, so we have a very strong area of supplied as being doing nothing well, it's been.
NEUT6|Plane out there being ranging for quite some time for several months and then present Baroque out and I'm brand new year.
BEAR7|We have supply has been created on the weekly time frame, around $35 per share, so there's a clear show bias on BP and many other or related stocks with the light crude oil dropping like a rock and also the brand oil as well.
NEUT8|So there's no reason to buy BP or any other old related stock cause.
NEUT9|It is following suit worn.
NEUT10|The Black Royal is doing and what the brain is doing.
NEUT11|We don't need any kind of.
NEUT12|An indicator or fundamental, so tell us what we should be doing in this wine.
NEUT13|Doesn't matter what the op hip has been doing, or the Saudi Arabia government has been doing with the old production.
NEUT14|We don't care about that.
NEUT15|Could these imbalances being eliminated.
NEUT16|Of course they could single time friend.
NEUT17|Remember, it's not enough to make a trading decision.
NEUT18|OK, this is just the weekly analysis we have the strongest imbalances located here in the weekly chart so you know you have to know how to trade.
NEUT19|These imbalances went to try them on.
NEUT20|When not to trade him, this is not a Secret Service, so these are super strong areas supply which is valid right now, but market conditions could change.
BULL21|Right now it's a valid email supply price for rallies into that area in 1-2 weeks.
NEUT22|That would be great, but if it takes a long time and then some scenarios happening, the bigger picture then these in balance and balance could be negated.
NEUT23|So you need to know how to trade these imbalances.
NEUT24|So sure, bias.
NEUT25|On BP.
NEUT26|This is a weekly time frame you can trade lower timeframes, obviously, but if you trade in the direction of the bigger picture train which is short biased, then it's better long long expecting prices to rally its Swiss Idol with the crude oil light, crude oil trend outlook and what the model most oil related stocks are doing.
NEUT27|So remember that this is not a Secret Service.
NEUT28|A single time frame is not enough to make a train decision.
NEUT29|You must know when and when not to place a trade based on your training plan and only only after putting the answers into context.
NEUT30|After doing a multiple time frame analysis.
NEUT31|If you want to learn how to trade these imbalances when not to trade them, you're welcome to join us in a certain forget trading community where you will learn how to locate these mountains, how to trade them, know fundamentals, and as it needed, no volume analysis, nothing at all.

NEUT34|"Bye bye."""
