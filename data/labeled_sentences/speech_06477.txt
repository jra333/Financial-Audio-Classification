NEUT0|"""What propelled you to sell things more than books?"
NEUT1|We after books, we started selling music and then we started selling videos and then I got smart and I emailed 1000 randomly selected customers and asked them besides the things we felt today, what would you like to see us sell?
NEUT2|And that answer came back incredibly long, tailed the way they answered the question was with whatever they were looking for at that moment.
NEUT3|So like I'm sure one of the answers was.
NEUT4|I wish you've sold windshield wiper blades because I really need windshield wiper blades, and I thought to myself we can sell anything this way.
NEUT5|Your stock.
NEUT6|At one point I think went to $100, but then it went down to six or something like that.
NEUT7|That whole period is very interesting because the stock is not the company and the company is not the stock.
BEAR8|And so as I watched the stock fall from 113 to 6.
NEUT9|I was also watching all of our internal business metrics, number of customers, profit per unit.
NEUT10|Everything you can imagine defects etc.
BULL11|"Every single thing about the business was getting better and fast and so as the stock price was going the wrong way, everything inside the company was going the right way."""
