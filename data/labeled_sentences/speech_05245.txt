NEUT1|We have a chat room going where we will teach you technical analysis and charting as well as many eyes on the market trying to find more profitable entries and exits of trades.
NEUT2|I hope to see you in there.
NEUT3|We are looking at Netflix on the daily and weekly time frames is the daily chart where each candle stick is 1 trading day worth of action.
NEUT4|You can see athletes is making a very bullish move here.
BEAR5|We have volume, you could see it decreasing on the pullback which is a great sign for the Bulls.
BULL6|Finding support and then increasing on the breakout.
NEUT7|Again, that is exactly what the Bulls want to see.
BEAR8|We have a break of the 70 level here which sometimes signals overbought, but as you can see with Netflix it signals the power zone.
BEAR9|One thing I do want to point out is we have a bearish three gap up pattern forming.
BEAR10|We had one gap up here, a second one and then a third one and because this came a stick is so far over extended above the Upper Bollinger Band.
NEUT11|I would definitely expect some bears to step in on Netflix tomorrow and to see a Red day.
BULL12|We do have a. Mac D Cross that is bullish here that happened today, so that is another good time for the Bulls.
BEAR13|There are a lot of good bullish signs on this chart, but again, it's pretty overextended.
BULL14|After the move that it has made in the past four days, it hit 650 an now we're trading over $750.
NEUT15|Move is nothing to sneeze at.
NEUT16|Look at Netflix on the weekly chart.
NEUT17|It just keeps going powerzone.
BULL18|It has been cruising in, found support right near this ten week moving average and then it is now setting out to new highs.
NEUT19|This is only one week one day.
NEUT20|In the weekly chart, so this pattern will change.
BEAR21|You can see that the price has knocked down twice from the 700 level.
NEUT22|The Bulls really want to see close over 700 at the end of the week by Friday, so I will keep checking in with Netflix.
BULL23|It was a very interesting day in a bullish 1/4 traders congratulation to anyone who made money.
