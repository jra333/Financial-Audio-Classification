NEUT0|"""We may be seeing a more broader acceptance of Bitcoin, but we also started the show talking about Bitcoin and another much less serious cryptocurrency Doge coin."
BEAR1|The idea that George Point can blow up that Elon Musk is tweeting about Bitcoin and Judge Point does that undermine or taint Bitcoin by Association.
NEUT2|No, I mean, it's one of these things where you know Dodge coin is meant to be sort of fun and a meme.
NEUT3|It's kind of like you know, the Internet can be used for sending silly memes, but also for serious business at the same time.
NEUT4|And crypto is like a financial Internet so you can trade meme stocks or meme coins on it, but also send real things.
NEUT5|Right, but this era that we're in and certainly we've seen this over the last few weeks, the power of mean stocks of you know, a group of retail investors.
NEUT6|Does that risk being confused as it risks?
NEUT7|Scaring off more institutional investors, corporations, or countries eventually?
NEUT8|Well, I think you know the Internet is just influencing everything and so the normal financial system is going to become more crypto like just like you know media became more Internet like and politics for better or worse became more Internet like so I don't think it scares it off.
NEUT9|I think we just see a convergence of the two.
NEUT10|Balaji, I'm curious.
NEUT11|I mean, if we're going to start talking about countries buying the currency for national security purposes, how price sensitive do they need to be?
BEAR12|I mean, do they need to wait for it to drop 50 to 80% before getting in trying to ride waves of prior valuations?
NEUT13|Well, I mean The thing is that it's in one sense.
NEUT14|Buying digital gold is similar to buying gold like you know central banks actually hold huge amounts of gold.
NEUT15|I wrote an article on this dip into my top of my Twitter.
NEUT16|They hold six, you know, India for example has 600 tons of gold uses like 8000 tons.
NEUT17|So the difference though, is that buying digital gold, unlike gold digital gold, is still in its massive price appreciation phase.
NEUT18|Personally, I think that if you're a long term investor, you should just basically by now you know I mean.
NEUT19|I've been seeing this stuff not when big wins at 40,000 or whatever the price is right now.
NEUT20|But since you know that was that like a dollar or less than $10.00, so you know, being consistent on this for many years, the interest rates we bought very very early and so I think that it's still on the ascent, though, because you know, maybe like 1% of the world or thereabouts holds BTC.
BEAR21|Offer to drop 50 to 80%.
NEUT22|You might.
NEUT23|You know you might have and appreciate 5X.
NEUT24|In the mean time, so it's hard to time that, but we can know is that in five or ten years is going to come probably much more valuable.
NEUT25|Right, we have had some, I mean, well established money managers.
NEUT26|Bill Miller comes to mind.
NEUT27|Who is come around to the idea of saying look take 1% of your cash and put it into Bitcoin is are you advising anyone from on on the retail front average households who have the have the income and the means to do this to do that?
NEUT28|Well, you know I'm not.
NEUT29|I'm not giving specific financial advice.
NEUT30|You know, everybody's going to have their own situation.
NEUT31|But you know, like I do know that there are people, for example, have kept several years.
NEUT32|You know, maybe you know of cash is a cushion.
NEUT33|The thing is whatever you invest in crypto because it's volatile enough, it can go up 10X or can go down 90%.
BULL34|But over the long term it's appreciated several orders of magnitude.
NEUT35|So whatever you put into crypto has to be money that you don't need to touch for a long time so that 1% rule I think makes sense from that perspective.
NEUT36|Because you know, you don't have to tap into that money to pay operating expenses.
NEUT37|If you do need to tap into the money, then you might have to liquidate it when the price is down, and then that's how you take a loss.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
