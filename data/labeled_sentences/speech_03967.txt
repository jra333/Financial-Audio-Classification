BULL0|"""Good morning everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to live trading action by in the money stocks.
NEUT2|My name is Nick Santiago.
NEUT3|Today is February 10th, 2015 Stockton.
NEUT4|I'm going to show you right now.
NEUT5|I'm sure you're all familiar with is Facebook and the stock.
BEAR6|If you take a look at the daily chart has been making a series of lower highs that is never ever a bullish condition.
BULL7|Now the stock still has a fair amount of support around the $74.00 level.
NEUT8|You could see that level was defended on multiple occasions here, but ultimately should that level break with any kind of velocity or volume?
BEAR9|That tells us that the stock will trade sharply lower.
NEUT10|Now I've isolated a level here on the chart mathematically, as well as using a chart and what I've come up with is a level right around the 67, fifty $67 area, and I think that would be an excellent buying opportunity if someone is looking to own Facebook now right now.
NEUT11|I'm not saying that the stock is going to break 74 and get down there.
NEUT12|I don't know if that's going to happen.
NEUT13|All I do know is if the stock does get down to 74, that's where I would be a buyer.
NEUT14|Of the equity.
NEUT15|So again, watch Facebook right now.
NEUT16|If you take a look at the stock and if it comes down with any velocity below 74 with any kind of volume on a closing basis below the most recent low pivot which was made yesterday, February 9th and that low right, there was basically right around the 7345 you come through there on a closing basis.
BULL17|There is a good chance will cut through this 200.
BULL18|Moving average and ultimately trade down to this level, but this is going to be an excellent buying opportunity.
NEUT19|For Facebook, in my opinion, right around the 6750 to $67 area Now if you take a look at a weekly chart, what you'll see here is that.
NEUT20|The stock prior had a wide range red bar going all the way back to the week of March 24th, 2014.
BULL21|Once Price was able to get through that level, that's where the stock broke out and made new all time highs trading above 80 late in 2014.
BULL22|So again, that's going to be a very very significant spot once again right around that $67 area for Facebook.
NEUT23|This is where the institutions took it through to the upside.
NEUT24|This is where they generally will come back in and support the equity member markets.
NEUT25|Love to do what they've already done so.
NEUT26|Again, just like people, we get down to 67 level.
NEUT27|That's where the institutions should come in and support the equity.
NEUT28|So keep it on the radar.
NEUT29|May not get down there for a week or two, maybe a couple of weeks, maybe even a month, but nonetheless when it does get there 6767 fifty that is going to be your area to get long.
NEUT30|Facebook.
