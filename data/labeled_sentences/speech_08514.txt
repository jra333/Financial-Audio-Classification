NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome to the moneymaker channel.
NEUT2|My name is Avi.
BULL3|I wanted to give you a quick update on ZOM stock 'cause it's gone up another 4443% today and it's an amazing run.
NEUT4|We've made some huge gains on it so I wanted to get this as quick as I can to you today so no dancing, no intro, just straight into the technical analysis.
NEUT5|So as you can guys can see we got into the stock when it was around 0.5 right and?
BEAR6|It went up just crazy.
NEUT7|Amazing, amazing, amazing, right?
NEUT8|We got in around here when it was zero point 4 zero point 5 right here I got in on this day and the 5th and then it was quite down and I was thinking to myself OK what am I going to do?
NEUT9|Am I gonna keep this position in my going to hold this position?
BEAR10|What am I going to do and I decided to hold it even though I was down on the position and then yesterday and the day before it just it went up huge.
NEUT11|We said that if it breaks this area I think that the next day.
BULL12|We'll get to this area and it went up even more more than I thought it was going to go up, and it went up all the way to touch a dollar.
NEUT13|It almost got there.
NEUT14|It was at 0.99 or something like that.
BULL15|0.98 and today we filled the gap and we opened up over a dollar.
BULL16|An were high.
BEAR17|Was it $1.48 and currently we're at $1.32, so we need to be careful with this stock because it's gone up a lot.
BULL18|We could see a pullback tomorrow of around 30%, so be ready for that.
BULL19|Or we could continue to go up another 100% another 50%.
NEUT20|The stock is on a crazy run, so it's really hard to tell with these penny stocks.
NEUT21|What's going to happen because there's no huge news.
NEUT22|It's just that more and more people have hearing about the stack and is getting more popular.
NEUT23|I've heard about this talk already for for a month or so on the Facebook groups people have been writing zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, ZOMOM stock whenever someone asked about a pennystock.
NEUT24|So watch out for this tomorrow and also.
NEUT25|Only 2% of your portfolio in a penny stock like this.
NEUT26|This is my rule and I try to stick by it.
NEUT27|I'm going to update you that I got out of part of the position.
NEUT28|I sold the profit and left the initial investment.
NEUT29|So I'm still invested in it with my original initial investment.
NEUT30|But I took out my profit and invested it in another stock.
NEUT31|If we go to the daily chart.
NEUT32|So you can see here, up with zooming in.
NEUT33|You can see here that we opened up it went up all the way to the upper view up, and then it consolidated.
NEUT34|Since then around the middle view up, and it's very interesting.
BEAR35|So we had a lot of volume at the open and since then the volume has gone down significantly.
BEAR36|There's another hour and 20 minutes for the market to close, and probably for the market and the last hour we're going to see a huge uptick in volume, so watch out for that.
NEUT37|If you're going to day trade this, I hopefully I can get the video up before the market closes.
NEUT38|"I hope to see you next time an like I always say, let's make some money."""
