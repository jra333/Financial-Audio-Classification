NEUT0|"""Hey, it's calling this video chart on ticker symbol APHA."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of America.
NEUT8|You know what?
NEUT9|Make this chart look?
NEUT10|The absolute strongest going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT11|Could say up there above the $18.00 mark.
NEUT12|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 18.
NEUT13|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage to actually stay above that level.
BULL14|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT15|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture POV.
NEUT16|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT19|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there have been defined as the move.
NEUT20|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls, run.
BULL21|Full healthy bowls are in full control.
NEUT22|His visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what has been presented again.
NEUT24|Sure, stand above 18 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart.
NEUT25|In terms of levels of resistance, Public Enemy number one moving forward will be that pink line right there.
NEUT26|It's on my chart, denotes the very well known.
NEUT27|The very famous 200.
NEUT28|Moving average currently valued at $18.90.
NEUT29|You can see price struggle to get above it at that point, if the price can actually break back above it next level after that would then be up there right around $19.20.
NEUT30|So keep running those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT31|But All in all, any angle you look at it, great volume today, great price movement, not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this moving forward?
NEUT32|Let's see what happens.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT34|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT39|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
