NEUT0|"""Hey, what is up you guys today we're going to be talking about Mara?"
NEUT1|Mara is a company that mines Bitcoin, so every time you see a spike or dip in Bitcoin Mara would do the exact same thing.
NEUT2|Mara was trading in the range of 20 to $25 for the past week and today, with Tesla announcing that they will be taking crypto as payment as well as.
NEUT3|Investing around $1 billion into Bitcoin is a reason why you see you saw a big spike in March.
NEUT4|Today we made a new high of 3438 and after hours and look at my 4 hour chart I can see that Mara form the copying handle pattern and we broke as soon as we broke $24.00.
NEUT5|Now I'm not going to sit here and tell you that Mars going to the moon.
NEUT6|That is for you to decide, because if you really think Bitcoin is going to keep going to the upside and guess what?
NEUT7|So is Mara.
NEUT8|However, if you think that we might see a pullback, just stay on the sidelines and wait for your opportunity.
NEUT9|I am not in Mara, I sold way too early and I'm currently trading other stocks.
NEUT10|I'm waiting for the pull back to the 2925 area.
BULL11|And possibly even.
NEUT12|This area here.
BEAR13|This area is where I would feel comfortable buying, but it's hard to know, but we are definitely bound to get a pullback on Mara soon because we are overextended in the 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes to one hour, the four hour and the daily chart.
BEAR14|Or I could be 100% wrong and a bunch of people could just buy Bitcoin tomorrow, driving the price up.
NEUT15|And bringing Mara with it.
NEUT16|This is just my opinion and you should do your own research.
