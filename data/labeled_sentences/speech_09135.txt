BULL0|"""I also heard that you made a tidy sum trading GameStop in the January short squeeze."
NEUT1|Tell me about that.
NEUT2|Or well, I got into early.
NEUT3|You know, I got in with options like the a good Robin Hood trader I guess, and selling options, not buying options.
NEUT4|Selling calls.
NEUT5|Around one $5200 level and 1 to 400, there's an adage by Bernard Baruch way back when it said sell to the sleeping point.
BULL6|Well, I I wasn't selling to the sleeping point, but I did manage to overcome my insecurities and hold on and write it all the way back down.
NEUT7|In terms of getting out back in, I'm still selling call options at 2:50 and 300.
NEUT8|The volatility is super high.
NEUT9|Eric and that promotes an ability to to make some money.
BEAR10|If so, you're effectively still short.
NEUT11|GameStop.
NEUT12|Yeah, not a lot, I mean.
NEUT13|I mean through the options market.
NEUT14|It's not like you've got a short position of borrowing a short position on the cash market, but.
NEUT15|Well it well, it sort of is if the option.
NEUT16|Comes to up.
NEUT17|The expiration comes doing and you forced a short chairs.
NEUT18|But you know right now the borrowing rate on shorted shares for GameStop, there's only 1 1/2 percent, which indicates no real squeeze or no real pressure, and so with volatility at 400% annualized, it's it's really, you know, you need a a Dublin and a doubling in order to start to lose money, and I think this is a perfect opportunity for option sellers, not.
NEUT19|Buyers to take advantage.
NEUT20|How much have you made on those trades so far?
NEUT21|Well, I was I was in the whole by about 10 million but.
NEUT22|"I'm about the same amount above ground."""
