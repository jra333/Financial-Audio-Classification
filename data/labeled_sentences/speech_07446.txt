BEAR0|"""US is refusing to resume trade negotiations with China without a firm proposal from Beijing to address forced technology transfers and other economic issues."

NEUT2|But that's exactly what Steven Mnuchin told us right here on this program earlier this month.
BEAR3|The impasse could undermine next month's planned meeting between President Trump and China's President Xi at the G20 meeting.
NEUT4|That's a meeting.
BEAR5|That a lot of CEOs have been hanging their hats on thinking that there was going to be some resolution at this meeting, or at least some progress in talks.
NEUT6|So we'll see what happens.
BULL7|Dow futures again indicated up by about 225 points.
BULL8|S&P futures up by 27.
BULL9|"The NASDAQ up by 118."""
