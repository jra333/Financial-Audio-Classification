NEUT0|"""What is up guys?"
NEUT1|I am back again with another video regarding Disney, so Disneyland is going to be opening up as soon as April 1st, according to California.
NEUT2|California granted them the.
NEUT3|Right to do so, so it's looking like Disneyland is going to be opening up April 1st.
BULL4|Disney might be getting back to business.
BULL5|Kovit is over apparently, and we're going to get back to business, which is great.
NEUT6|Really, really great for Disney, so I'm an investor in Disney.
NEUT7|I love it.
BULL8|And I believe that there is a chance that Disney could rally all the way till April 1st and beyond.
NEUT9|Maybe and my logic.
NEUT10|Is this OK?
NEUT11|Netflix is a what a $350 billion company 400,000,000.
NEUT12|Let me let me look that up right now.
NEUT13|Let me look that up right now with Netflix.
NEUT14|It's only 228.
NEUT15|My bad 228 billion and Disney sitting here.
NEUT16|Let me look at some live data here for you.
NEUT17|Disneyland at 344 billion, and so my logic is if Netflix can be 224, I mean Disney should be at least three to five times that size, right?
NEUT18|Because you know Netflix and Disney, they both have really good streaming services.
NEUT19|Netflix has about double the subscribers that Disney has at 200,000,000 Netflix Subs.
NEUT20|Disney has 100,000,000, but they're rapidly growing and on top of that, Disney has the theme parks and all the iconic series they own Star Wars they have, you know, The Lion King, Aladdin.
NEUT21|All of these movies in franchises they've made.
BEAR22|So I think there are very valuable company and I do believe they are undervalued.
NEUT23|That is my opinion.
NEUT24|This is not financial advice, I am just a regular *** dude.
NEUT25|I'm not some financial advisor or anything like that even if I was just because you're a financial advisor does not mean you know everything, by the way.
NEUT26|But anyways, that's just my opinion as a person that invests in Disney, I think that we might see.
NEUT27|250 by April that that could happen, I think even 300 is not out of the not not out of the ballpark.
NEUT28|Certainly by the end of the year I could see $300 being a price for Disney stock, so I'm holding it strong.
NEUT29|I'm not going to sell it, ever.
BULL30|And it's going to be exciting.
NEUT31|So Disney is getting back to business guys.
BULL32|Pretty awesome stuff.
NEUT33|I'll be watching that closely.
NEUT34|On Monday I'm recording this on Sunday, March 7th right now 5:00 o'clock PM so.
NEUT35|Will see what happens Monday.
BULL36|"I'm really thinking that there might be a big day Monday, so thanks for watching guys will see you next time."""
