NEUT1|He's you know, crazy enough to think he can change the world, and thus he might be one of the ones who do change the world.
NEUT2|I think we're still as they said, in Latin School, in media res, which means we're in the middle of the story.
NEUT3|I don't quite know.
NEUT4|You know exactly what SpaceX and the S model Tesla all seem to be doing quite well.
NEUT5|But like Steve Jobs, he has, you know, full well he's skating on the edge and Steve got ousted at one point.
NEUT6|So I think he's doing really well and I love the fact that he's a man of passion and obsession.
NEUT7|Likewise, you know, Bezos has just continually try out.
NEUT8|I'll tell a story real quick about your mentor.
NEUT9|In mine, a guy named Don Logan who ran Time Inc. And in 1999 we at time you were over at Fortune at that time were making bezo's person of the year and all of a sudden the air started going out of the Internet stocks.
