NEUT0|"""Did I always sounds reasonable, though I was going over this with Helene Meisler some fabulous stuff on Twitter."
NEUT1|She does have known for 30 years what it.
NEUT2|It's too early if we want to convince ourselves that's what we're doing.
BULL3|We're convincing ourselves at any decline is really interlude.
NEUT4|It's a dip that needs to be bought.
NEUT5|But when the economy reopens, that changes everything.
NEUT6|We already have some nascent commodity in wage inflation in the system.
BEAR7|Once throwing a huge stimulus package, and suddenly lots of investors are worried about an inflation scare like we saw in late 2015.
NEUT8|The last time the economy is coming out of the doldrums.
NEUT9|See at that point, Fed Chief Janet Yellen raise interest rates and the market.
NEUT10|Well, the market took it on the chin, even though we all knew it was going to happen.
NEUT11|Well, this time should be different.
BEAR12|I mean today are more dovish Fed Chief Jaypal think different tag he knowledge it could be some uptick in inflation.
NEUT13|He said.
NEUT14|Don't worry about it.
NEUT15|He practically told us to relax.
NEUT16|So what happens would have been better if it said we had to raise rates.
BEAR17|Probably because the bond market reacted viciously with long term interest rates spiking and that's what took the whole stock market down.
NEUT18|And believe me just go look at his talk.
NEUT19|You'll see what he says and then watch the averages.
BEAR20|It's cause and effect and short stocks are getting hammered because the bond market vigilantes as we call them are.
NEUT21|Angry, we've got millions of new investors who don't even understand, and I don't need to be telling condescending, but they don't understand the connection between bonds and stocks.
NEUT22|And I gotta tell you, I didn't understand it either.
BEAR23|Going back to the five stages of grief, these people are in denial about how bonds could impact their stock portfolios.
NEUT24|And like, get that see.
NEUT25|I remember when I was a kid I got to Goldman Sachs in the early 19 days.
NEUT26|There's a fellow David D'Arcy, it's regular on CNBC and he's playing to me that I needed to check how the bond market was doing before I said a word about stocks.
NEUT27|Any clients?
NEUT28|I don't want to hear that.
NEUT29|And I was Adam and I said, listen to you, let me tell you something.
NEUT30|I didn't cheat him, but I said let me tell you something.
NEUT31|If a company is doing well, it stocks going to go up Darst and chief me.
NEUT32|He sat me down and he walked me through how the bond market represents the sum of all fears about inflation.
NEUT33|Supply, OK, oversimplification, but all you need to know is that the professionals are taking their cue from the bond market, not the much more stock market.
BEAR34|So you can't afford to be in denial about this linkage, you're just gonna get hurt.
NEUT35|Otherwise, you'll never be able to understand what's really killing the stocks of the paypass.
NEUT36|Or the Home Depot.
NEUT37|So they invented the Telegraph and it's not their business.
NEUT38|Is Bond market sure if Jaypal turns out to be right?
NEUT39|If there's no tsunami of inflation?
NEUT40|Well then we got a different story.
NEUT41|I mean that we we probably should be started buying today, but it could be months before we know it.
NEUT42|If that's the case, we still gotta go through these stages.
NEUT43|You just do before the market can bottom, and we're early on in the process.
BEAR44|Sadly, for many stocks in this market, some are not involved with this, but many are denials everywhere.
