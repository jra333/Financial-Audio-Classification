NEUT0|"""The US bank regulator, the Federal Reserve released the results of two sets of examinations called stress tests, more awkwardly known by their official names."
NEUT1|D fast and SQL.
NEUT2|The pure quantitative results from the fast were released last week, all 33 the largest U.S. bank holding companies under review passed the test.
BULL3|This meant that they would have sufficient capital to withstand a so-called severely adverse scenario.
NEUT4|A hypothetical catastrophe that is adjusted from year to year.
BULL5|This year it included a scenario where unemployment doubled to 10%.
BEAR6|The stock market took a nosedive, and most interesting Lee interest rates flipped to negative.
NEUT7|The more interesting results were delivered late on Wednesday in the second phase called CCAR, which includes a qualitative review that touches on the banks, risk management, internal controls and governance.
NEUT8|All of this culminates in what investors care about most.
NEUT9|How much can banks payout in dividends and share buybacks?
NEUT10|If shareholders are most interested in the cash coming their way, perhaps bank bosses are most worried about not being publicly humiliated by a failing grade.
BULL11|In that sense, Wednesday's results were good.
BULL12|31 of 33 institutions had their capital plans approved by the Fed, including traditional lagers like Bank of America and Citigroup.
BEAR13|The two failures were US subsidiaries of European Banks, Deutsche Bank, and Santander.
BEAR14|It was the third consecutive year that the Spanish bank did not satisfy the Fed and the second straight black mark for the German firm.
BEAR15|Morgan Stanley also got a warning about its internal risk management, but for the rest of the group it was party time as it is estimated that capital return will reach $96 billion.
BULL16|You'll be 1/5 higher than last year.
BEAR17|Citigroup alone was tripling its dividend.
NEUT18|The irony for most banks is the stress test.
BULL19|Day may be the highlight of the year interest rate hikes they need to boost.
BEAR20|Net interest margin are not likely to materialize anytime soon as the global instability will keep the Fed and check in stock prices will suffer.
BULL21|But with $700 billion of equity raised since the financial crisis, institutions are a solid as they have been in years.
BULL22|That's good news for depositors, creditors and regulators.
NEUT23|"Shareholders, however, will have to wait patiently."""
