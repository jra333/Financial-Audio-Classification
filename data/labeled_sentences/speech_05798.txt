NEUT0|"""So look at this."
NEUT1|This position was brought to me by my my Discord group.
BULL2|You could see that really, Sky rocketed up 67% Romeo Power, six percent 67%, and it's currently increasing.
BULL3|You're seeing this massive movement up to $13.64, opening up at $8.74.
BULL4|Also, having an increase in a little bit of a gap up in the pre market.
NEUT5|So this was all due to the fact that they had a deal with a truck maker.
BULL6|A battery deal with the truck maker, and you're seeing that massive increase, so it's up.
BULL7|It was up 29% when they when they actually made this news, but it's up 67 or 66% right now and you're seeing that massive increase.
NEUT8|So if you were in here, you were able to get a massive day trade out of this or swing trade out of it.
NEUT9|If you held overnight.
BULL10|So this is a great position thanks to the Discord Group for bringing this to my attention.
NEUT11|'cause I did not see it.
BULL12|"I did see that a top gainer, but I didn't see it before that."""
