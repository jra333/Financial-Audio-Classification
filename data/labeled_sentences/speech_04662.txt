NEUT0|"""LTC we start with one of our chart."
NEUT1|OK further analyzes.
BEAR2|We have been looking for buy and when the price was here we mention if you want to look for by me we can put this to in relative to each other's running flat for continuation but as we can see the prices start to drop.
NEUT3|No one see how we can look at this and the point will I mean what the things we point on that we want we mentioned.
NEUT4|If you want to look for continuation we want to price to break their previous storage is 199.
BEAR5|By the way, as we can see, the prices start to drop.
NEUT6|That's why in my last video you mentioned whoever get the trade within this move.
NEUT7|They have to start to manage it all right and one more things.
NEUT8|We get more.
NEUT9|Most of the charts we get this down move.
NEUT10|Now the question is whether we're getting the bigger correction for continuation or this is the start of the down move.
NEUT11|OK, in this case we start with.
NEUT12|Daily chart and as you can see this on daily chart.
NEUT13|We have been looking for this correction for yourself.
NEUT14|This is what we get now.
NEUT15|We want to see whether we can get a correction here for continuation or this one can tend to correction and related this to this.
NEUT16|For one more drop.
NEUT17|This is what we need to be careful mostly will we will be more interested if we get a correction here for continuation.
NEUT18|This is what we're looking for.
NEUT19|OK and if you move to flow over chart, if you mentioned you know what analysis we want the price to break.
NEUT20|199 following by 208 or 209.
NEUT21|OK, but the only thing is.
NEUT22|What we get here is a correction.
NEUT23|We want to see whether we get the confirmation whether this is a correction for continuation or the price.
NEUT24|This is the start of the reversal because.
NEUT25|First of all, mostly we will be more interested as expanding for correction for continuation, but we need to know made this one turn to expanding flat for one more drop.
NEUT26|That's why if you want to look for trade here, we need to be quite careful.
NEUT27|That's why even in my last analyzes when the price was within this move, I mentioned whoever cut the trade within this move.
NEUT28|They have to start to manage.
NEUT29|OK, and if we move to one over chart, the first things we can point on one over chart.
NEUT30|If you put this one in relative to this.
BEAR31|Indicators showing us the divergent than we can say it is one of the reason the price to drop.
NEUT32|First we talk.
NEUT33|As we mentioned, we're looking for BI is still we can look for this as a flat but expanding flat.
NEUT34|Any reversal from here we can look for pie.
NEUT35|This mean if you got any rivers or we get there by, we will run with the break out of this stuff.
NEUT36|We start to manage.
NEUT37|But right now we cannot look for by because we don't have any trade setup.
NEUT38|We don't have their reversal even there is a possibility that one turn to more complex correction if we get it can give us better traits that are rather than looking for the expanding flat.
NEUT39|OK but.
NEUT40|If there is a continuation with any flag disease where we need to be careful, careful, any trade we got from here, we have to take out the trade because this is where we can get their indication for their contribution.
NEUT41|OK, ideally, right now we don't have any traits that we will have the boat possibility either to look for by yourself.
NEUT42|That's me for continuation for buy or reversal.
NEUT43|That's why it's better because experiments on forward chart.
NEUT44|I mean even explain we expect based on the different possibilities.
NEUT45|That's why we want to look for trade.
NEUT46|We have to wait and get the proper trade setup.
NEUT47|Then from there we can make a decision whether we should look for buy or sell.
NEUT48|In this case we just follow the chart.
NEUT49|"If I see any update, I will share, thanks."""
