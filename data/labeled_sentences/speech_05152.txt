NEUT0|"""You know, I mean, I think 40% of Americans have Apple iPhones, and I think the other 60% really view TV as a luxury because they have more life based expenses first."
BULL1|So I think Netflix was a cheaper alternative to cutting the cord at the beginning.
NEUT2|But now my view is that everybody who wanted to cut the cord is cut the cord and people understand the value proposition of cable.
NEUT3|And if they still have cable, that's because they watch live sports.
NEUT4|Or they love having 200 channel optionality.
NEUT5|Or they just don't want to, you know.
NEUT6|Cancel the screaming.
NEUT7|Undergo the screaming when they turn off Nickelodeon or history channel or military channel which are on no skinny bundle.
NEUT8|But so I don't think the entrance of new streaming services makes people want to cancel the cable bundle, but rather than trying to pick one streaming service over another, what you've done your favorite pick in streaming for 2020 is a company that facilitates streaming Roku.
NEUT9|Yes it is.
NEUT10|It's an aggregator so it doesn't care whether Disney wins or Apple wins or HBO Max loses.
NEUT11|It just aggregates everything.
NEUT12|It's like an arms dealer.
NEUT13|How much more?
NEUT14|How much higher can it go?
NEUT15|I mean, I guess it comes down to where we are in the cycle for streaming right now.
NEUT16|Where is that?
NEUT17|Do you think?
NEUT18|So I mean, I think streaming will get more competitive, and I think winners will be defined by branding balance sheets and bundling.
NEUT19|But I think this is a war that's going to take three years to play out and they just market more on Roku, which is to say they need subscribers.
NEUT20|So customer acquisition cost is going to go through the roof, and that means spending.
NEUT21|And Roku has 42% of connected homes, so the best place to spend is on Roku telling you that there's a new series available on Disney Plus.
NEUT22|Or an Apple plus and another company you like Laura, which again is sort of to Bill's point, helps facilitate advertisements across a number of platforms is sort of the oddly named the trade desk.
NEUT23|I've never heard of them.
NEUT24|You look at their name, you're thinking, is this some kind of a stock broker EF Hutton?
NEUT25|What is it?
NEUT26|No, they do.
NEUT27|Digital and online advertisements.
NEUT28|TTD is the ticker.
NEUT29|Why do you like the name?
BULL30|So I like it because I think there's going to be a huge explosion of advertising demand.
NEUT31|They're saying $10 billion of political spending and add units on television or fixed at about 14 minutes an hour, and trade desk facilitates putting ads all over the open Internet connected TV, but also on newyorktimes.com washingtonpost.com.
BULL32|So I think trade desk is a beneficiary of higher advertising demand in 2020, not just connected TV, but that stock is already up 133%.
BULL33|To this year not counting today's rally, it's still going higher.
NEUT34|It's not already in the stock.
NEUT35|No, like Roku is a triple trade desk was a double.
NEUT36|I think that you can maybe get those kinds of results next year.
BULL37|Again, that's my hope.
BEAR38|How much pushback did you get on your Netflix downgrade?
NEUT39|I mean, I think you're the only sell on the street.
NEUT40|There might be one more.
NEUT41|70% of analysts have as an overweight or a by.
NEUT42|I mean, are you in hiding?
NEUT43|Are you OK?
NEUT44|Are you in a safe house?
NEUT45|Yeah, yeah exactly.
NEUT46|I have moved to a safe house.
NEUT47|The Russian mob is protecting me because everybody hates me, but I'll bet you still watching the Crown.
NEUT48|Nope, I'm watching the Mandalorian on Disney.
BULL49|Plus, it's an excellent show and I love baby Yoda.
NEUT50|"All right there you go, Laura Martin, who's doing well out there and just just don't don't go near their headquarters, Laura."""
