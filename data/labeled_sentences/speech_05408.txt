NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol oh XY."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day today, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|But just to set the context, and I realize I'm probably stating the obvious here, but after today Awhole lot of downward pressure is shown up, which brings about the question of OK, well.
BULL8|Were some levels of support because support levels are at least.
NEUT9|I mean, they're not guarantees of where downwards pressure would stop, but it's at least a rational thought to have you know, potential areas where you know there could.
NEUT10|You know the price could find a bidan maybe bottom out.
BEAR11|So for this we're actually going to squeeze down the chart here and go back quite a bit in the charts history, which really illustrates just how much this thing is falling.
NEUT12|Because now at this point, with the amount of downward pressure that is shown up next level of support.
NEUT13|Not until down here.
NEUT14|Around that level at 1275.
NEUT15|Now am I saying that the price is hitting 1275?
NEUT16|You know?
NEUT17|Tomorrow I'm not saying that my point is just from the overall technical point of view.
NEUT18|I mean, this is a very important level.
NEUT19|You look over there, you can see it acted as support, acted as support and now at this point I mean just looking back through it.
NEUT20|There's just simply isn't any other data points that would suggest any other sorts of major levels of support.
NEUT21|So in other words, kind of the chart is in freefall mode right now.
NEUT22|Again, doesn't mean that it's for sure going down there, but.
NEUT23|I don't think anybody would be shocked if the price eventually not necessarily on Thursday, but over the next few days.
NEUT24|All of a sudden was doing battle and bouncing around at 1275 Mark, so keep a close eye on that.
NEUT25|From the support side of things.
NEUT26|Now in the event the price does decide to bounce back up, key level of resistance watch is going to be that purple or excuse me pink line there that 200.
NEUT27|Moving average and this is just based on a foundational role in charting that when levels of support are broken so you can see right there did a great job of acting as support, but then it was broken today.
NEUT28|But when levels of support are broken they tend to act as resistance.
NEUT29|So if there is any sort of bounce upwards, keep an eye on that.
NEUT30|Which is currently valued right around 1425, but overall very very rough day chart is in freefall mode, so we'll see how things continue to play out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird.
NEUT36|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT37|But in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
