NEUT0|"""Drive a little bit deeper into the action right now with our market supporters."
NEUT1|Abigail wanted to get started Romaine.
NEUT2|I'm on Amazon watch 'cause of course it is the first day of the two day sale that annual Prime Day sale event for Amazon.
BULL3|But I'm watching more so the trillion dollar Mark was Amazon almost there, similar to earlier last week in the middle of last week, when it briefly went above a trillion dollars.
BEAR4|The same thing last September when the market cap briefly above a trillion dollars in that brutal fourth quarter.
BEAR5|This year's huge run up right now, about $7 billion away.
NEUT6|It'll be interesting to see Emma as reports come.
BULL7|In around the Prime Day event, whether or not it will be enough to push the shares above a trillion dollars.
NEUT8|Emma Abigail.
BEAR9|I was watching oil with WTI tumbling below 60 bucks a barrel and suffering its worst loss in about 2 weeks.
NEUT10|Couple of reasons for this.
NEUT11|Of course.
BULL12|Hurricane Barry moving in land, allowing drillers to begin restarting production in the Gulf of Mexico but also the long term outlook for prices was brought more sharply into focus today by data from China economic growth slowing to a 3.
BEAR13|Decade lower than, of course, the unresolved trade dispute continuing to weigh on sentiment.
BEAR14|It may mean that we could be some time before we see new highs for the oil market that $60.00 level is a key psychological level, and falling below it will be a blow to bulls.
NEUT15|Remember the last 12 month high for oil came back in October, it over $76 a barrel.
NEUT16|We're going to break through 60 before we can take aim at 7020 tip.
BULL17|I'm taking a look at steel stocks which got a pretty big or interesting bump during the session today.
BULL18|This is after U.S. President Donald Trump said that he would increase US steel usage and as a result we saw the New York Stock Exchange Steel Index rise just a little bit during that session.
NEUT19|And we also know that particular stocks there.
BULL20|You can see the New York Stock Exchange ARCA still index rose a little bit during the session, but we saw AK Steel holding up to its highest since July 8th and we saw US steel up by the most.
NEUT21|Since around June 25th, during the session, which looks like it ended just a little bit.
BEAR22|But however, throughout the entire year, US Steel is down.
BEAR23|This is because U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on foreign steel have cost US steel.
NEUT24|"The more than $5 billion and that was a substantial percentage of its market cap romaine."""
