NEUT0|"""Well, the investment profession is known for making rational decisions based on hard numbers."
NEUT1|Sometimes, and if the pandemic has shown us anything, though it is that things can get emotional in the markets in our lives whatever, and Wells Fargo Investment Institute is out with a look at how extreme swings the upside or downside can create some behavioral biases.
NEUT2|Joining us now is Veronica Willis investment strategy analyst for the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
NEUT3|Veronica, you know most of us you know who can, or kind of sit at home and look at in our portfolios, most of which have gone up.
NEUT4|What kind of mistakes are we making now?
NEUT5|What kind of behaviors did we have before that maybe got exacerbated during the lockdowns?
NEUT6|I think that the big one here is that recency bias.
NEUT7|A lot of people, myself included, are guilty of that one, and that's just where we believe that the market will continue to behave.
NEUT8|As it has recently and then use that as a baseline for future expectations.
NEUT9|So when the market is going up, you think that it's going to continue to rise, that the ride will be smooth, and that's not necessarily what we're seeing.
NEUT10|We've seen some volatility, so it's very crucial when you are.
NEUT11|Facing a recency bias to make sure that you're sticking to your plan and that you don't deviate from that plan to take on more risk than you're intending.
BULL12|Well, you know, listen Veronica is a lot of new participants in the market, which by the way, is great retail investors.
NEUT13|We love it.
NEUT14|Come into the market.
NEUT15|We want young people because they grow up to be old investors that have been in the market since the railroads.
BEAR16|Veronica, you know everything's kind of gone up lately.
NEUT17|It's really easy to think that you're super good at investing.
NEUT18|I hope we all are, but history says that's not the case.
NEUT19|And I think that's where that overconfidence bias comes into play, where you think you know everything and you're making the right decisions, but I think the important thing here, if you suffer from the overconfidence bias, is to keep on educating yourself.
NEUT20|Uneducated investor is a good investor and we can all learn more about investing and knowing what we're holding.
NEUT21|Making sure that if we have a plan, we're sticking to a plan.
NEUT22|If we don't have a plan, then we're reaching out to an investment professional to figure out what that plan is.
NEUT23|If to make sure that we are re evaluating that plan when we need to.
NEUT24|Well, you've got the friend that jumps off the Cliff into the Lake.
NEUT25|You know, without really paying attention to the risk, that's the one into the spectrum.
NEUT26|Then we all have the friend.
NEUT27|Who sits there thinking about it all day until gets dark and then we go home and they have regret aversion, right?
NEUT28|They they just can't the frozen.
NEUT29|They can't make a decision.
NEUT30|We all know those people.
NEUT31|You can't be that person either, right?
NEUT32|Veronica, don't do that.
NEUT33|Absolutely right.
NEUT34|You'll be way too conservative, especially if you're looking at a long term investment.
NEUT35|So if you're investing for your retirement, and if you've got this regret aversion, you're too afraid to make these decisions.
NEUT36|So you put him off.
NEUT37|Or you completely avoid making those decisions.
NEUT38|And your portfolio may be too conservative and you're not allowing it to grow, and I think you have to challenge yourself a little bit to get in the market and realize that over the long term the market moves higher.
NEUT39|Your plan is there to help you, whether that short term volatility and so.
NEUT40|I think that's why it's so crucial to have that plan so that you are prepared when there are downturns, because that's inevitable, inevitable part of the market.
NEUT41|And that's usually when it's a good time to get into the market when those prices are low.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
