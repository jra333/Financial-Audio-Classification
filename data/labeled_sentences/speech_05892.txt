NEUT0|"""So you take that, but then you also say at the year end he thinks it's 3200."
NEUT1|OK, so Jim and I have a very similar time frame.
NEUT2|We kind of look out and say if I'm going to get stuff cheaper, I'm going to start nibbling now and then.
BEAR3|Steve, you're right, it could go 2530%, but I will tell you I am not fast enough and nimble enough.
BEAR4|Maybe pulling the trigger when it goes down 10% in one day and it kind of bounces back the next, but it's 17% and I see stocks down 30%.
NEUT5|I'm going to start as Carrie said by some of these stocks that I think will work.
NEUT6|A year, two years down.
NEUT7|I'm not going to speculation.
NEUT8|I'm not going to hide debt, leverage models and looking at high quality companies that I want to own the Disney's of the world.
NEUT9|The loads of the world, Zimmer's of the world.
NEUT10|I'd even add to JPMorgan down here.
NEUT11|So let's go there.
NEUT12|'cause I said at the top.
NEUT13|I want to spend a lot of time talking about actual stocks today.
NEUT14|I want to find out what you guys are doing.
NEUT15|If you're doing anything and I'm surprised to see, maybe to some extent that you and Kerry Seurat.
NEUT16|Or adding a lot of names, a lot of names.
NEUT17|If I have client sitting with cash, which I have been and we've talked about it since kind of selling over the last three months, I am now starting to go back in stages to say these are the high quality companies that I think I want to own and I wasn't able to in the last couple years have full positions in some of these companies.
BEAR18|OK, so you're adding to Disney, so Disney disease down from 1:45 to 1:05.
NEUT19|OK, I'm heading to Lowe's, which is, you know, home building products?
NEUT20|CEO just bought some more stock.
NEUT21|Imagine Zimmer which.
NEUT22|Hey, we know in the next three to six months people are not going to replace their hips and shoulders high quality company in a low valuation.
BEAR23|I'm adding to JPMorgan at $9798, down 35% if not more.
BULL24|Morgan Stanley, which is a solid wealth management business, trading below book CVS CVS training at 8 times earnings, which I think is so cheap you know it has leverage, but definitely manageable leverage.
NEUT25|Aluminum, which is gene sequencing.
NEUT26|That's not going away.
BEAR27|The stocks come down quite a bit of it's high.
NEUT28|"Yeah, it's a high P stock, but it's a growth stock and these are the companies that I want to own and appeared like this."""
