BEAR0|"""By what do you think is the most overcrowded trade right now?"
NEUT1|Well, it's interesting.
BEAR2|I would have said that the reopening trade where we were buying just the name such as casinos, hotels, airlines was really overcrowded a couple of weeks ago.
BULL3|That's backed off a little bit, but we're seeing a much broader market.
NEUT4|You know, since the middle of February, Andrew, 73 1/2 percent of SNP stocks alright are ahead of the index.
NEUT5|Last number last year, that was 35%.
NEUT6|So the market is brought in.
NEUT7|Into names that are both industrials which are reopening financials, but we're seeing some of the companies that were hot last year that have fallen start to show a little bit of life.
BULL8|Facebook for example Facebook and Google their moving higher because they're going to benefit from companies advertising to consumers who are getting stimulus checks, and they're going to spend that money so you know you're beginning to see more of the market moving positively as a.
NEUT9|A benefit of what we know is a big number of GDP growth.
NEUT10|OK, let's let's talk about a couple of stocks that you like.
NEUT11|In particular, I'm curious about Palatine, 'cause I know that something that you've you've now invested in.
BULL12|its IT went on quite a run.
NEUT13|It had a pull back where you at.
NEUT14|Well, we've been watching Polotan, we didn't own it.
NEUT15|Last year we watched it, we had a price target around $100 a share, an it hit it.
BEAR16|I mean the stock was down, you know 35% and we think that this is a new type of business that their first mover.
NEUT17|They have an advantage they haven't even touched the addressable market in the world.
BULL18|And you know, there's no reason that peloton can't continue to grow and put up very good numbers for the next.
NEUT19|You know 5 plus years.
NEUT20|So we did the work on it an.
NEUT21|We waited and we bought it and it was interesting.
BULL22|Yesterday it was a strong stock yesterday.
NEUT23|The names on the top of our list were like Peloton, Twilio and Man re/max that's real estate brokerage firm and what tech which makes locomotives and railcars.
NEUT24|So that's you know, that's something that we haven't seen in.
NEUT25|You know, maybe year, that kind of combination of names up at the top of the leaderboard.
NEUT26|So you know, we think that's about GDP growth.
NEUT27|I don't know if you can see the screen, but we've got to lay up there too.
BEAR28|That's another stock that went on quite a tear.
NEUT29|At this point, you still feel confident.
NEUT30|Yeah, so to Leo is a stock that we bought last January.
BEAR31|We bought it again in March and we have cut it back four times because of the tremendous growth.
NEUT32|You know when you get the little text message to say, you know you can go into your dentist's office.
NEUT33|Now that's from Twilio.
BEAR34|Used to be Uber, but they shifted dramatically and well, so the stocks come down.
NEUT35|We think at this level you know it's attractive.
BEAR36|These names that were arc Big Arc Holdings that dropped you know 20 to 40%.
NEUT37|Some of them are oversold and that's the type of name we you know we like right here and we think you know had just has an enormous runway accelerated growth last year, but you know now it's come back.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
