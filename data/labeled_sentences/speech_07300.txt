NEUT0|"""Hi, it's Andy Bush economists and moving my clients from chaos to confidence and I am in Portland OR looking over a beautiful square with a wonderful Christmas tree down there."
NEUT1|The cities all lit up and it's just gorgeous and I thought I'd pop out a quick video to you.
BULL2|It is been an interesting couple of days as in it and the markets have rallied significantly.
NEUT3|If you think about it, there's four things going on.
NEUT4|First of all, I think most people realize the impeachment process really isn't going to derail the economy, so there's that second thing is obviously the good news on USMC A.
BULL5|That's a huge positive and removes a lot of question Marks and uncertainty for businesses in Canada.
NEUT6|In the United States and in Mexico.
NEUT7|So that was a big one to get done.
BULL8|It's a huge win for the president, but it's also really good for the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi, who who got this to the finish line.
NEUT9|So happy days.
BULL10|That's a great thing.
NEUT11|The next step is China.
BULL12|Clearly that was a good win.
NEUT13|We're still waiting to get all the details, but I think the enforcement process is what's really interesting.
NEUT14|So if you dive into that a little bit how that gets ratcheted up past the usual blockers in China all the way up to the top of the House, I think there's about 2 levels before it goes all the way up to either Le Quang or who's in town.
NEUT15|I'm not quite sure which one, but she Jinping I shouldn't say who should tell.
NEUT16|It's pretty funny that was a few leaders ago, right?
NEUT17|But you know that's the process that I think a lot of American companies were concerned about, but also how quickly it ratchets it up through up to Robert Light Houser.
BULL18|So that's a good thing.
NEUT19|I think.
BULL20|Overall it will help alleviate some of the slow molasses movement on if you have problems in China for a business and then finally we got some good news on a budget right?
BULL21|And I think that's also encourage ING from the United States and that will take us out too.
NEUT22|I believe September of next year, so those are all really good things.
BULL23|Moving forward, we had the Fed meat less, you know last week nothing really happened there, but also they continue to pump up the economy and continue to quantitative ease.
NEUT24|So from that standpoint, I mean look, let's take a step back and go holy smokes.
NEUT25|Who had this like five or six things?
BULL26|Just really good by the end of the year.
BULL27|So to me it's no surprise that we're seeing a strong movement in the stock market and putting in new highs almost every day.
NEUT28|Alright, that's it for me.
BULL29|Any Bush economists moving my clients from gas to confidence and I hope you're getting all your Christmas shopping done.
BULL30|"It is beautiful here in Portland, OR."""
