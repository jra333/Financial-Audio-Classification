BULL0|"""Red Day today guys."
BEAR1|We did close at $12.49 down a dollar 4410.34% and this does initiate the SSR roll for tomorrow and it is a pretty healthy pullback.
NEUT2|But as you can see here on the yearly timeframe we do have a Cup and handle breakout formation forming.
NEUT3|We do have a gap to fill down there at $11.00 and that would form the rest of that handle.
BULL4|We also do have some strong support at $11.20.
BULL5|I do expect us to pull back to that range, bounce off of it and eventually retest highs at $20.36 because as you can see by that trend line and we still are in a pretty strong uptrend guys after we break that high at $20.36.
NEUT6|"That's when the real squeeze can begin."""
