BEAR0|"""Let's get to Amazon because right now we're down about 9% in the after hours session just off the after our session lows."
NEUT1|Let's bring in Gene Munster, founder of Ventures.
NEUT2|He's right, in the thick of the earnings trench, listening on the alphabet call gene.
BEAR3|What caused that decline to 9% after hours?
NEUT4|It's pretty simple.
BEAR5|Melissa, is that they guided revenue down by 5% for the December quarter.
NEUT6|And this the holiday quarter.
BULL7|Investors are always optimistic for some upside in that quarter.
NEUT8|So that really put some cold water on it across the board.
NEUT9|If you look at the rest of the metrics, they were essentially.
BEAR10|In line, so I think that was the big thing that spooked investors.
NEUT11|So down five, so did they say did they give us more colors?
NEUT12|So what was the driver behind that shortfall for the holiday quarter?
NEUT13|They haven't yet, so that Google calls going on right now.
NEUT14|The Amazon call starts in at the bottom of the hour here, and so waiting to hear more from that call.
NEUT15|Alright, what do you make of the alphabet quarter?
BULL16|So far it's been a juicy earnings call.
NEUT17|The company is talking about the future evolution of search.
NEUT18|This is not only search but discovery, using AI to better predict what you're looking for that could produce new ad units.
BEAR19|The big negative on this call was that.
BEAR20|The paid clicks were down 28% year over year.
BEAR21|The street was looking for down 21%, but the point is, is that they're thinking about new ways that they can make powerful ads that can improve that cost per click and separately, just well, I cut away to talk to you.
NEUT22|They were starting to talk about China.
NEUT23|"The company seems to be changing its view on how to approach China over the last several months and so look for analysts to be talking a lot about that tomorrow."""
