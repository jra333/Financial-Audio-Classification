NEUT0|"""I'm going to show you how I link a stock worksheet to the Yahoo Finance website."
NEUT1|I'm going to start off trying to link up stock AAP.
NEUT2|What I want to do, start off by putting my.
NEUT3|Starting cell location.
NEUT4|To be a one.
NEUT5|Want to make sure that I have the data tab selected and I want to select from the web.
NEUT6|One day browser comes up.
NEUT7|I want to put in the link that's going to go to the Yahoo Finance site.
NEUT8|And the AP stock.
NEUT9|And you notice that when that website comes up, there are a number of arrows.
NEUT10|That highlights certain tables.
NEUT11|And what I'm going to do is I'm going to select.
NEUT12|Section called earnings estimate.
NEUT13|Earnings history EPS trends.
NEUT14|Growth estimate and you notice for every one of these sections that I select, they have a green background.
NEUT15|The ones I have not selected stay yellow.
NEUT16|And when I'm done, I select import.
NEUT17|And I'm going to have it important to location A1.
NEUT18|And you'll see that it's going to pull that data down from Yahoo.
NEUT19|There it is.
NEUT20|Next cell location.
NEUT21|We want to go to his cell G1 and this is going to hold our historical stock prices.
NEUT22|So I will again go to the from web.
NEUT23|Like I'll put on our stock.
NEUT24|I'll select the historical prices link.
NEUT25|And then I will select the table that has all the stock prices.
NEUT26|I will select import.
NEUT27|That's going to go to G1.
NEUT28|There it is.
NEUT29|There is our historical stock prices brought in in stock.
NEUT30|The next one I want is going to be location 01, and that's going to hold our Yahoo ROAE figures.
NEUT31|So go back to the web.
NEUT32|Put in our stock.
NEUT33|I'm going to browse to the section.
NEUT34|Called key statistics.
NEUT35|And I'm going to select the area called management effectiveness.
NEUT36|And you notice that is the return on equity that we want to use in our best of the best filter.
NEUT37|I will import it.
NEUT38|To section 01.
NEUT39|And it brings it down.
