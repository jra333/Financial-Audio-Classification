NEUT0|"""Hi guys, tonight April 28, 2020 I will share to you my own personal technical analysis of Amazon, so currently it's trading around 2327 and it's actually live."
NEUT1|It's our video is recorded and will upload it within the next few minutes.
NEUT2|So let's see.
BEAR3|Currently the RSI is going down.
NEUT4|So the price.
BULL5|Could possibly re test this support line here.
NEUT6|So.
NEUT7|That's around.
NEUT8|Here or.
NEUT9|Around 2272 within that level.
NEUT10|And a key catalyst for it to bounce is of course the earnings, which are true May 1.
BULL11|So analysts are estimating an estimate of around 6.26, so if it's a surprise we could possibly see a bounce from here.
NEUT12|So bonds from here.
NEUT13|So that's.
NEUT14|Around.
NEUT15|2655 orders the fib.
NEUT16|Retracement of 1.236.
NEUT17|So again, let's see how the previous earnings is.
NEUT18|It's a surprise.
NEUT19|That's is.
NEUT20|So.
NEUT21|That was a surprise based on previous earnings, so let's see what's happened.
NEUT22|So that's actually.
BEAR23|You see, there's there is a gap up.
NEUT24|So if ever it will repeat.
NEUT25|This scenario.
NEUT26|And will surprise investors.
NEUT27|Depending of course on where is the.
NEUT28|Candle or where it closed.
NEUT29|Chilling that time before the announcement of the earnings.
NEUT30|So.
NEUT31|Yeah, actually the possible target is around.
NEUT32|2655 still.
NEUT33|But again, it depends on the.
NEUT34|Closing price of Amazon shares before the earnings, please.
NEUT35|But to be honest, in my own opinion.
NEUT36|The Amazon shares will be another surprise, so this scenario might repeat in itself, so that's actually is the I think that's.
NEUT37|Four, yeah.
NEUT38|That's actually the all time high, if ever it.
NEUT39|Is also a surprise for this coming first quarter.
NEUT40|So yeah, let's see.
NEUT41|Half the price goes or how the earnings will.
NEUT42|Be this coming May 1, so there you go guys.
NEUT43|So if you have some comments, questions and feedback please feel free to reach me out.
BULL44|"Thanks guys."""
