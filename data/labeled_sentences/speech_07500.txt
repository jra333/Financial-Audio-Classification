NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video today.
NEUT2|We're going to be talking about Apple REIT stock and we're not talking about Apple, the tech company we were talking about a real estate investment trust.
BULL3|Now this company is at $15.10 and it has actually almost gone all the way up to where it previously was before the pandemic.
NEUT4|Now.
BULL5|I myself do own shares of this company and I believe this is a strong company to buy into for the long run.
NEUT6|As you can see, everyone in the news is saying that is over valued and.
NEUT7|That it is basically in the overbought sector right now.
NEUT8|Now if you want to add more to your positions I would hold out a little bit on buying positions.
BEAR9|It's at such a high price at the moment.
NEUT10|Because you could have picked this up for around $4.50, not even six months ago, so.
NEUT11|44% of analysts out of the nine analysts are saying it's a buy rating a strong buy, and then 11% are saying it's a buy.
BULL12|As you can see that a high price target of around 19 and then their support and resistance line is gradually going up.
NEUT13|As you can see, they're paying about $0.01 per share at the moment.
NEUT14|And some insider activity.
NEUT15|This guy named just tonight, but 9400 shares on September 16th.
NEUT16|We got their EPS right here.
BEAR17|It looks like it's going to be estimated to be in the negatives.
BEAR18|Roe is also in the negatives at the moment, so I would definitely wait for this to bounce back.
NEUT19|I would not buy into this company right now at the moment and I would wait to maybe see a pullback too.
NEUT20|Maybe now I want to say roughly 8 to $12.00 so.
BULL21|Just so you guys know, they definitely have a lot of total assets compared to the liabilities, which is great.
NEUT22|But other than that, they have a 2% dividend yield and their debt to asset is 37% for everyone who doesn't know what Apple Hospitality REIT is.
NEUT23|Their hospitality REITs.
NEUT24|Basically they have 235 hotels more than 30,000 guestrooms in 87 markets through 34 states.
NEUT25|Companies like the Marriott Hilton, Hyatt Hilton Gardens courtyard, stuff like that and they are located in quite a bit of the states.
NEUT26|34 states in our country.
NEUT27|So yeah, that's a quick little update on this Apple Hospitality reach, which is a specialized reach Ana residential and commercial reach ETF weightings.
NEUT28|As you can see there are there are ETF's that have this company in their portfolios.
NEUT29|An glad night in just tonight are the top key players, so hope you enjoy this video and I would wait to pull back on this.
NEUT30|"Before you buy."""
