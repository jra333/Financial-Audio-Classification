NEUT0|"""Is it markets dampened an less volatile, a lethargic, a lassitude?"
NEUT1|Or will there be more volatility with our trip through the zero bound?
NEUT2|Look, I think that the bottom line here is that this has nothing to do with the economy.
NEUT3|The financial markets have nothing to do with the economy and what's happened with the stock market in the past few months has zero to do with anything about a V shaped recovery.
NEUT4|It has everything to do with the fact that you have a central bank and in fact globally.
NEUT5|But you have a fed with an endless.
NEUT6|Pocketbook that is taken the risk premium down to zero.
NEUT7|This is a different Tom.
NEUT8|This is a different bed than anything we've ever seen in the past.
BULL9|So I would say that they have totally mitigated volatility in the marketplace.
BULL10|They have totally illuminated the risk premium in the marketplace and they will continue and powerless coded out already.
BULL11|They will continue until they are comfortable with the fact that the economy is on a self reinforcing growth track.
NEUT12|This could be years, so the Fed.
NEUT13|So basically it's like Powell is the blackjack dealer in the casino handing out the chips for free.
NEUT14|And as long as that's going to happen, volatility will be muted.
NEUT15|"They will eliminate scale risks in the marketplace and the financial assets will remain completely disconnected from real economic activity."""
