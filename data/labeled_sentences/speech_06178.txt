NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, looking at today individually a very ruthless day.
BEAR5|A very cruel day.
NEUT6|I mean when you stop and think about the fact with how strong Amazon started off, I mean great.
NEUT7|Move to the upside.
NEUT8|But that upside movement not only did it go back to where it started, which was, you know right around here will call it so it went right back to where it started.
NEUT9|Actually, just drop down a little bit lower and went all the way down there.
NEUT10|Now to give some credit credits through the price did ultimately you know fight back upwards but just a big tease right to think that that thing was getting ready to go and go and then just totally reverse itself around.
NEUT11|But within the you know the price action that we now have after the data.
NEUT12|It's become very apparent that the level to watch extremely closely is going to be that pink line right there.
NEUT13|It's on my charger nodes.
NEUT14|The very well known, the very famous 200.
NEUT15|Moving average, and the tricky part about it is not the fact of, you know if the pricing get above it, the price is proven many times right.
NEUT16|There you can see is gotten up above it right there.
NEUT17|It gotten up above it and then you look at today, gotten up above it.
NEUT18|So it's not a question of will can the price break that level?
NEUT19|Can the price actually get above it?
NEUT20|The question becomes, can the price actually stay up above it?
NEUT21|Can the price maintained the break because?
NEUT22|As you see here, each and every time the price has gone up above it, it's like somebody flip it, flip the switch and the momentum just disappears an back down.
BULL23|The price goes, so that is definitely going to be a very critical level of resistance to watch moving forward right there around.
NEUT24|Let's just call it 3258, give it.
NEUT25|I mean, we're talking about $3000 stock, right?
NEUT26|So give or take a few dollars right around that area is going to be the key area, but again, just to really emphasize and not about cannot break above it.
NEUT27|But can the price actually stay up above it as far as levels of support or concern?
NEUT28|Key level to watch now.
NEUT29|In the near term and you know, probably speaking you'd want to see the price they above 3150.
NEUT30|If that level can't quite hold up, then at that point wouldn't be shocking to see the price, then go down, then revisit the 3:21 or excuse me 3122 Mark, so keep an eye on those couple areas from the support side of things.
NEUT31|But yeah, overall that 200.
BEAR32|Moving average definitely being very very stubborn.
NEUT33|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|I've revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
