NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking bout Diffusion Pharmaceuticals ticker symbol DFN.
BULL2|This stock I've been watching for awhile and I think there's a lot of potential here.

BULL5|So far.
NEUT6|I just want to recap some of the stocks we talked about on the channel over the weekend.
BULL7|The three stocks we talked about over the weekend or on a pretty big today, the first one being L CCO stock which was up about 120% so far.
BULL8|Today we also talked about SOS stock, which was up over 80%.
BULL9|Today and then Lastly, we talked about HCMC stock, which was also up about 25% earlier.
NEUT10|So for this video I want to talk about another one of these stocks.
BULL11|I think is a lot of potential going forward.
NEUT12|The company is called Diffusion Pharmaceuticals ticker symbol, DFF and the company is a biotech company that focuses on enhancing the body's ability to deliver oxygen to different parts of the body.
NEUT13|The company is working on drugs treat different types of cancers so that once the cancer is beaten, the patient does not have to rely on medications for the rest of their life.
NEUT14|So how this drug would work is if we want to move more oxygen into actually in a private issue within the body, which in turn helps to fight cancers and other diseases.
BULL15|The stock has had a big day so far as we got some news from the company.
NEUT16|The news regarding the completion of the Phase 1B clinical trial.
NEUT17|The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the safety of giving more frequent doses than what's usually typical in a clinical trial setting.
NEUT18|Look at the actual trial itself.
NEUT19|These patients were split up into four sequential groups.
NEUT20|Each of these groups having six patients and each patient was receiving the same amount of doses, just a different frequency rate on Friday, the Safety Committee observed that there were no dose limiting toxicities or serious effects from being given the 1.5 milligram dose.
NEUT21|So what's next?
NEUT22|So we already know from previous announcement from the company that they're playing two more additional clinical studies to evaluate the efficiency of TSC on both ends of oxygen journey through the body.
NEUT23|The first of these two future studies will measure the effects of TSC and tissue oxygen delivery using their new device oximeter, also known as TC Om.
NEUT24|This study is expected to be completed by the second quarter of this year.
NEUT25|The second of these studies would be to measure the effects of THC and the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inspired air to the bloodstream.
NEUT26|The results for this study are expected to be completed by the third quarter of this year.
NEUT27|So there are a lot of catalysts and studies coming up for this company, so I really like the potential here.
BULL28|I'm expecting that the stock will continue to grow over the year as each of these studies come out.
NEUT29|So if you missed this talk or think about when you should get in, definitely look for a dip, especially after big green days like this.
NEUT30|Don't chase it.
NEUT31|Worst case scenario, you find another stock.
NEUT32|There's big stocks like this that run a lot everyday.
BULL33|But with that said, I'm personally going to keep buying on each dip and hold this long term 'cause I do see this as a really good long term hold for my predictions.
NEUT34|I think the stock is see $10 by the end of the year, if not higher, but a lot of this is going to depend on how these studies come out and how well they do.
NEUT35|So what do you guys think about this talk?
NEUT36|Let me know your thoughts and predictions down below.
