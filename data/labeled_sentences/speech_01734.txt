BEAR0|"""Hey guys, what's up?"
NEUT1|And welcome to the channel.
NEUT2|My name is Sean and I make videos about personal, finance, health, happiness, relationships, all kinds of fun stuff like that.
NEUT3|So if you're into that please stick around.
NEUT4|Maybe consider hitting that like button and let's get into the video.
NEUT5|So today's video is about the three stocks that I bought today, but also a little bit of a follow up on yesterday's video.
NEUT6|The first stock I bought today was ticker symbol G, An OG AKA Golden Nugget gaming.
BEAR7|So you guys, as I mentioned yesterday, anytime I see this play drop below $20.
BEAR8|I'm going to be bouncing all over it and trying to add to my position now.
NEUT9|As always you guys I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT10|I am just your friend.
NEUT11|But if I were you I would maybe at least consider adding this one to your watchlist and anytime it drops below 20, maybe consider adding it to your portfolio.
NEUT12|The second stock I added to My Portfolio today was ticker symbol NGA, otherwise known as North Genesis acquisitions.
BULL13|Now I was actually able to average down on this one and grabbed five more shares at $27.00 apiece.
NEUT14|I am happy to do that anytime this particular stock drops below $30.
NEUT15|Now NGA is another acquisition company.
NEUT16|You guys, I have a bunch of them.
NEUT17|I love them.
BULL18|They're doing really, really awesome things right now with the EV in the tech space is exploding.
BULL19|But NGA in particular is doing some really good things.
NEUT20|They've just merged recently with Lion Electric.
NEUT21|They make some electric buses or so they hope to be manufacturing those very soon.
BULL22|And also there's rumors of a possible Amazon deal in the in the future, so I'm very bullish on NGA you guys, and I think this one below $30 is.
BULL23|Definitely at least adding to the watchlist if not adding to your position.
NEUT24|Lastly, you guys, the third play that I added to My Portfolio today was ticker symbol KO, otherwise known as Coca Cola Company.
BEAR25|So you guys this one again was low.
BEAR26|Today it was below $50 I believe I got it at $48.00.
NEUT27|I don't particularly spend a whole lot of time trying to catch my my dividend plays on a dip per say, but with this one being glaringly low at $48.00 it was kind of a no brainer so I went ahead and added another five shares to My Portfolio.
BEAR28|So you guys, all three of these stocks very well could be trading low again today on Tuesday.
NEUT29|So in the very least, keep an eye out for him.
NEUT30|Maybe consider adding them to your watchlist if they drop into your comfort level, maybe consider adding them to your portfolio.
BULL31|Hey you guys you made it to the end and I really appreciate it.
