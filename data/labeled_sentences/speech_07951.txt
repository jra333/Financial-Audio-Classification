NEUT0|"""Scott, one of the terms that I say thrown around quite a bit, is market capitalization or market cap."
NEUT1|Can you give give a bit of an explanation?
NEUT2|I guess as to what that actually is.
NEUT3|Yeah, sure.
NEUT4|We're used to seeing shares listed a price per share, right?
NEUT5|So Willis might be $38.00 a share or you, Thank you.
NEUT6|$80.00 A share.
NEUT7|Now that doesn't mean, Thank is twice the price of Woolworths and it does per share.
NEUT8|Missing is the number of shares outstanding.
NEUT9|Now let's go back to our favorite feature example, right.
NEUT10|If I see you Ryan slice of pizza, I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks.
NEUT11|You said?
NEUT12|Well, that's a lot for a price of pizza.
NEUT13|I'm gonna say, yeah, but how big slice?
NEUT14|And this is the key one here, right?
NEUT15|So when you think about market cap market cap is the price of the whole pizza one things OK?
NEUT16|Dollar Slice you want to drop it for another slice.
NEUT17|So yes, right?
NEUT18|Please unfortunate that big happy with that.
NEUT19|So that's the difference in the answer is market capitalization.
NEUT20|Is the share price per share times the number of shares?
NEUT21|In other words, in a pizza example.
NEUT22|So how much is the whole pizza?
NEUT23|So just $5 a slice, but it's $20 because their four slices, or it's $2.00 and there's ten slices?
NEUT24|Market cap still $20?
NEUT25|Or the price?
NEUT26|The pigeon is still $20.00, but the number of slices are the number of shares and the price per slice or per share is where the rubber hits the road and that really gives you a sense of the overall size of the company.
NEUT27|You have two companies both worth $2.00 a share if ones got 10 shares, the $20 company was going to million shares.
NEUT28|That's a $2,000,000 company.
NEUT29|Same price per share.
NEUT30|A very very different market capitalization.
NEUT31|Which tells you about the size of the company itself, not just individual slice.
NEUT32|So there's no set amount of shares or set number of shares that any company anyone company will have.
NEUT33|It's kind of crazy right?
NEUT34|It can be, I mean sometimes have literally billions of shares because they've they've raised so much money over time, they just keep issuing shares like confetti, other reasonably small and Bruce said it absolutely, it's irrelevant.
BEAR35|This was really hard for people to understand.
NEUT36|If you look at a list of share, price is $2.00 five dollars, $10.20 dollars.
NEUT37|People attempted to kind of look at those in in kind of relative terms.
NEUT38|$20 companies, 10 times.
NEUT39|As expensive as a dollar company or what's morning for us.
NEUT40|People say like $0.10 a share.
NEUT41|It doesn't have much to be $0.20, only get $0.10 versus a $10 coming up $10 to $20.
NEUT42|That's actually exactly the same thing they both got to double in size to get the return you're looking for.
NEUT43|So it's really, really important to think about price per share, but the value of the overall company.
NEUT44|In other words, it's market cap.
NEUT45|OK, so really the market cap, we know what the market cap represents.
NEUT46|What market cap would you generally look for and come out?
NEUT47|Great question.
NEUT48|So the other it doesn't matter.
NEUT49|All that much, but it is worth thinking about what would have to happen for to get the growth you wanted out of an investment you might make.
NEUT50|I just had a $2.00 company in a $20 company.
NEUT51|Can be the same size, that's true, but I $2,000,000 company and a $2 billion company have to do a lot differently right?
BEAR52|Well this is going to really struggle to double its size from here because it's already got 1000 plus supermarkets area.
BULL53|Really big business has doubled from here so look its absolute size gives you that sense.
NEUT54|If you got a $20 million company Heaps riskier but also does have more potential to be 'cause it doesn't.
NEUT55|You don't need as much additional growth from 20 million to 40 million market cap in market size.
NEUT56|This is a business like, well, it's already in the multi, you know 10s of billions of dollars and that's the key difference here.
NEUT57|So be careful coming there too small.
NEUT58|They seem attractive, but they're probably super super risky.
NEUT59|The ones that are too big can be great solid investments, but probably aren't going to give you the sorts of returns you might be after.
NEUT60|If you're trying to beat the market, that makes perfect sense.
BULL61|Thanks a lot.
NEUT62|"Scott extron."""
