NEUT0|"""Good afternoon everybody, just want to go over a couple of things on a zoom and Facebook will zoom today."
BEAR1|We know it came down a good amount.
BULL2|Zoom was up this today to an all time high of about 179 up 17% in the last week and.
NEUT3|Just last three months is just crazy 122%.
NEUT4|They're really cheap.
NEUT5|Stock year ago we look at them.
NEUT6|October, October $62.00.
BEAR7|They have skyrocketed with the recent virus.
NEUT8|So why did?
BEAR9|Zoom plummet at around 2:00 PM today, April 24th.
BEAR10|It just came down about $20.
NEUT11|Well Facebook, Facebook's new video chat Zoom competitor is coming soon to the platform and so it acts a lot just like zoom.
NEUT12|The chatrooms basically video rooms and it really jumped up Facebook's price.
NEUT13|Today you can see Facebook was trading around one 8189 all day today or I'm sorry one eighty 1842186 intraday.
NEUT14|And then all of a sudden boom big price, price jump.
NEUT15|I actually got in.
NEUT16|I was trying to get in at 101 eighty 7 and I got in around like one 8188.
NEUT17|And then I sold like 189.
NEUT18|So I made about a dollar gain on that altogether.
BULL19|But yeah, so it kept going up.
BULL20|Keep going up to 191 fifty seven at the close.
NEUT21|Actually, it's after hours after I was actually higher.
BEAR22|But as of market close close on the weekend when one 9157 so Facebook is going up, zoom went down once this thing actually gets released.
NEUT23|Will see who's preference, what the preferences with the video platforms, but as a quick update to why Zoom felon Facebook skyrocketed?
NEUT24|"Have a good have a good evening everyone and will talk to you soon."""
