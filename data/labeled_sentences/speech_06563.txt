NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Monday, December 12, 2016.
NEUT2|Today will look at the US dollar versus the Canadian dollar and the daily chart.
BEAR3|We can see the USD CAD pair extended its decline on Monday to touch a low one point 3110 and this is lowest level since October 20.
BEAR4|The short term bias remains in place and this is highlighted by the falling RSI in the following month.
NEUT5|The.
BEAR6|Prices are heading towards the 200 day moving average now and this would likely act as support and restricted further decline.
NEUT7|This support level lies at one point 3074 and actually can sides with A-fib annachi level.
NEUT8|It's the 61.8 for Minacci retracement level of the rise from one point 2762 to one point 3587 now below this support level.
NEUT9|Another key support level at one point 30.
NEUT10|Will also act as a support.
BEAR11|But given that they are size now approaching oversold levels at 30, there could be some consolidation or a bounce in prices in the near term.
NEUT12|So if we look to the upside now we have resistance at the 50% Fibonacci G an this level lights at one point 3172.
NEUT13|Above this we have a 38.2 fever Nachi and this is at one point 3270.
NEUT14|And of course there's further resistance.
NEUT15|At the 50 day moving average, at one point 3338.
BEAR16|But overall, the near term bias remains to the downside for now.
BULL17|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
