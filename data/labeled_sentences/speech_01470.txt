NEUT0|"""I'm Mark Reese here with Matt Young Money, Koppenhaver and our stock of the day is Berkshire Hathaway, Matt Berkshire."
NEUT1|Like a lot of large firms filed its 13 F yesterday.
BULL2|Big new positions in Suncor Dish Network.
NEUT3|But what caught your eye?
NEUT4|Those two positions definitely caught my eye.
NEUT5|These are outside of Buffett's typical strike zone, but they're probably not positions that were taken on by Buffett talk a little bit more about that in a moment, maybe what caught my eye was there were a couple of financial firms that couple banks.
NEUT6|US Bancorp Bank of New York Mellon.
BULL7|That Berkshire increased its stakes in.
BEAR8|I love that everybody is still negative on banks.
NEUT9|Everybody's very positive on buffet, but they can't seem to put those two pieces together.
NEUT10|I'm bullish on both.
NEUT11|Always bullish on Buffett now.
BEAR12|Dentity changes in his portfolio.
NEUT13|Change your opinion of Berkshire Hathaway?
BULL14|Will then change my opinion, but one of the things that it did is strengthened my view that Buffett's got these new portfolio managers in their Todd Combs and Ted Wechsler.
NEUT15|He's giving them a lot of autonomy.
BULL16|These new positions I'm almost positive or both in the portfolios of Wexler and Combs, and I like that they're getting that autonomy.
NEUT17|I like that they're going to do their thing.
NEUT18|Everyone is talking about the new positions, but is there anything that people seem to be missing about the filing?
NEUT19|What I haven't seen a lot of coverage of really interests me is there's a line in the filing.
BEAR20|That confidential certain confidential information was left off the filing, but submitted to the SEC.
NEUT21|This seems mysterious.
NEUT22|It seems very UN buffet like, but the last time we saw this was in Berkshires 13 F. Filing was back in August of 2011 and investors in Berkshire might remember that in November of 2011, Berkshire announced a giant surprising position in IBM, so this could be a sign that Berkshire and Buffett are amassing a really big position in some new stock that will see.
NEUT23|A few months from now.
NEUT24|Alright, definitely something to keep our eyes on for Young Money.
NEUT25|I'm Mark wreath, that's our stock of the day.
NEUT26|"Will see you tomorrow."""
