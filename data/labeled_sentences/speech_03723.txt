NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you charts and not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT3|I've been through this analysis on a very routine basis, did it on Tuesday, and for those of you that have watched the past videos, this will make a little more sense.
NEUT4|But finally, finally in regards to what if you haven't watched any of the past videos?
BULL5|Finally, the price has been able to not only break above this red line here, but actually be able to stay up above it.
BEAR6|So $0.37 as I talked about Tuesday's video has just been a very, very stubborn.
BULL7|An annoying level, but the price today, like I said, not only got above it but also stayed above it.
NEUT8|So that is where our first update comes into play.
NEUT9|In this is just based on a foundational role in charting.
NEUT10|Which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed above you want to see them act as support, so going forward.
NEUT11|Ideally speaking, $37 is that ideal level.
BEAR12|Don't get me wrong though, it's not like if the price falls below that area then that implies that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT13|But you have the price can stay above 37.
BULL14|That would certainly be a big sign of power going forward.
NEUT15|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT16|That's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword being moving as time goes by this line here is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT19|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move, that right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT20|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT21|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control of your best.
NEUT22|Visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT23|Yeah, stand up 37 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as where the new level of resistance is.
NEUT24|That pretty straightforward here.
BEAR25|The party finally stopped today on several occasions right up there around $37.90.
NEUT26|So 3790 Public Enemy #1 going forward, but really resistance levels don't matter.
NEUT27|What do I mean by that?
NEUT28|What matters the most is what the price is already been doing, and that is this right here.
NEUT29|Just building higher based.
NEUT30|Or if you want to pitch their steps.
NEUT31|So as long as the stair steps continue on in the upward direction, then given enough time everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT32|So focus on those healthy consolidations and building those higher bases and just sit back and let the trend do its thing real quick.
