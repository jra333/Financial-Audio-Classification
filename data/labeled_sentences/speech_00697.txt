BEAR0|"""Speaking of electric vehicles, Elon Musk has now confirmed that Tesla's Gigafactory in Nevada was the target of a cyberattack between the last night."
BEAR1|Calling it a quote serious attack, the FBI reportedly busted the operation before it can get it off the ground.
NEUT2|Now, Finance senior columnist Rick Newman is here, Rick.
NEUT3|Interesting few months for Elon Musk's Twitter account hacked now is precious giga factory.
NEUT4|Yeah, this is an intriguing case in the indictment.
NEUT5|Lays out some very interesting details, so this is a 27 year old Russian national named Igor Cruise Cough.
NEUT6|Who apparently tried to recruit an employee at the Gigafactory to insert some malware into the company's software systems and they would use that malware to number one extract data from Tesla and then basically try to blackmail Tesla.
NEUT7|As we've heard about in some of these other ransomware cases saying if you don't pay us at least $4 million, we're going to make this information public.
NEUT8|So what it looks like happened, is this employee went to the FBI and they were able to arrest this guy?
NEUT9|As he was trying to fly out of Los Angeles, probably back to Russia.
NEUT10|So interesting questions here are.
NEUT11|Is this linked to the Russian government somehow?
NEUT12|There's no indication in the indictment that that is the case.
NEUT13|It seems as if this is a ransomware for profit operation and in the indictment they did mention at least two other companies.
NEUT14|This group has targeted successfully and at least a couple other additional companies they were trying to go after.
BULL15|Which I think you hit it.
NEUT16|It's a for profit kind of situation, but why Tesla?
NEUT17|Right?
NEUT18|'cause I can think of other companies that might have data that would be more valuable to do.
NEUT19|A cyber attacker don't know if they didn't say it didn't say why Tesla.
NEUT20|I mean I we could, we could speculate.
NEUT21|Maybe just because Tesla is a world famous company and everybody knows where it operates.
NEUT22|That could be.
NEUT23|It could be that they thought they had identified some particular vulnerability at Tesla.
NEUT24|It could just be that they thought the person they approach to work works at us.
NEUT25|Maybe they just thought that person was a good vulnerable target for some reason.
NEUT26|Don't know.
NEUT27|Rick, do you think this will feed the notion that Teslas automobiles could be hacked?
NEUT28|I mean they've sold thousands of Teslas with autonomous driving driving capabilities.
NEUT29|Who's to say that someone's car can't be hacked and taken over and cause mass chaos chaos with it?
NEUT30|You know, cars can be hacked in theory.
NEUT31|I mean there there have been some demonstrations of that.
NEUT32|It is not something that really happens in the real world and Tesla.
NEUT33|In this instance, I mean that you know we don't know exactly how they.
NEUT34|Map to this guy.
NEUT35|Whether Tesla help whether Tesla was aware of what was going on or not, but you know Tesla did not get hacked at the end of the day, they did become aware of this as it was in progress.
NEUT36|They did take some efforts to make sure they they closed the vulnerability, if there was one, or they make sure that this guy or this group could not get the information, but you know, to Tesla's credit, maybe they just got lucky, but there have been other companies that I mean lots of other companies that really did have holes and in some cases gaping holes allowing hackers to get in.
BULL37|So I think Tesla did OK here.
NEUT38|They might have just got lucky though.
NEUT39|Alright, Rick Newman.
