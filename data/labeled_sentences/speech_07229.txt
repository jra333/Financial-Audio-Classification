NEUT0|"""Hello Traders and welcome to the Vantage Point Trading Journal for today."
NEUT1|Tuesday March 20th, 2018.
NEUT2|We're going to show you our vantage point in forecasting market movements and show you what you need to pay attention to.
NEUT3|Today we're going to focus on Facebook.
NEUT4|It's been in the news all week and we've seen the price movement actually have big big ramifications for the overall market.
BEAR5|Pulling everything down yesterday and we're seeing a continued move down today.
NEUT6|What we're looking at here is.
BULL7|We see that we had the predicted we have the we have the bearish crossover from above.
NEUT8|The simple moving average.
BEAR9|To below we see the precipitous move down we see today that that there the AI is predicting future.
BEAR10|An even stronger moves to the downside with the predicted high and low being lower than yesterday's actual high and low.
BEAR11|And then we see that the neural index is in the red position, signaling continued weakness to the downside.
NEUT12|So what do we do with that?
NEUT13|So with options, will stock, you could just anywhere in this area you could look to short it.
NEUT14|We were trading about 170 this morning and we identified a March 29th weekly expiration 162 and a half 165 put spread one to pay $0.60 for it that has a maximum risk of what you pay for the spread that $0.60 the maximum reward is the width of the spread less any premium we paid.
NEUT15|So that's $2.50 -- 60 cents.
NEUT16|Or Dollar 90 so our reward is $1.90.
NEUT17|Our risk is 60.
NEUT18|That gives us a reward to risk ratio.
NEUT19|7 to one very, very healthy.
BULL20|And as we continue to move on today, Facebook continued on so great call by the platform.
NEUT21|We were there to catch the the the continuing falling knife.
NEUT22|"And we'll see you next time."""
