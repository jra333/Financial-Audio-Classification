NEUT0|"""One thing you notice as you look for trends this morning is the number of either secondaires or note offerings."
NEUT1|I counted RCL, Norwegian Twitter, and Shake Shack this morning.
BULL2|Yeah, of these I mean, obviously, RCL really smart to take advantage of the frantic buying by younger people.
NEUT3|The buying at 4:00 AM was just insane.
NEUT4|I mean, I don't know what they were thinking because one thing I know it well, Caribbean was thinking was this is an opportunity to be able to fix our balance sheet.
NEUT5|Norwegian already had a good balance sheet, so I was a little surprised because I think that they have some very good orders, but the one that really was, I think, terrific was the Twitter announcement because Twitter is investing was one of the things I had Ned Siegel on this week.
NEUT6|The CFO, they do in a 1.25 billion convertible note.
NEUT7|I'm sure that they'll pay, you know, get incredible prices, David when you do a convertible note and your Twitter, you pay through what a mortgage mortgage cost people.
NEUT8|Yeah, I just think that Twitter is totally love stock.
BULL9|After being a dislike stock and the reason why is 'cause they're spending and you hear over and over again from analysts were saying you know what Twitter was dormant and now they're spending and this is very good news for them because they had fallen behind even Pinterest.
NEUT10|I shouldn't say pictures pretty good, but you know what I mean?
NEUT11|They've fallen behind companies that you didn't think of as being necessarily a must buy, but I think Pinterest is a must buy and Twitter is going.
BULL12|Twitter is becoming a must buy.
BULL13|Yeah, you've said that an obviously the stock has been a been a big buy so far this year up 4044%.
NEUT14|Best look at that and see your to date as we just begin the month of March.
NEUT15|But you're right 1.25 billion.
NEUT16|We don't have the pricing on it Jim, but one would expect it's pretty aggressive.
NEUT17|Yep, and you know the question is always been right will they?
NEUT18|Will they make the right investments?
BULL19|Are they innovating quickly enough?
NEUT20|Are they changing the platform in ways that they should?
NEUT21|You seem to think the answer now is.
NEUT22|Yeah well, I was on spaces last week and.
NEUT23|I was only given one tweet.
NEUT24|They told me that we are treated like 8 at 8:30 for 9:00 PM.
NEUT25|Show was kind of a beta and we had 3000 people instantly and it wasn't.
BULL26|They were very good.
NEUT27|I said look, I can't tell these people are.
BEAR28|One of them was called.
NEUT29|I don't know like a corn.
NEUT30|Another guy was called Super Joe you know?
NEUT31|I mean you have to know these people are because you invite them in to talk right.
NEUT32|And I saw a rich Greenfield fixture.
NEUT33|Jason Calcanis used to be a guy that we thought about in New York.
NEUT34|Is those squawk memory was like Ally New York yells Silicon Alley.
NEUT35|Comes on all the time on the show, yes, but what I liked about it.
NEUT36|David was that it is a rival to this fabled clubhouse that everybody likes him, right right?
BULL37|Which yes, Carl, which has, which has grown dramatically as well.
NEUT38|Have yet to participate.
NEUT39|Not sure I will, why you have why?
NEUT40|Yeah, I like to give these things time, time to season a little bit.
NEUT41|Get a sense for them.
NEUT42|Well, Carl, you know that these things are fun.
NEUT43|They're fun.
BULL44|Yeah, I've got it.
NEUT45|I've got to check out clubhouse myself.
NEUT46|As for Twitter, I think it was last week.
NEUT47|Goldman went to 112 today.
NEUT48|It's Baird goes to 81.
NEUT49|MKM goes to 95.
BULL50|So you guys are right, the streets definitely rating, at least on the price.
NEUT51|Targets for Twitter.
