NEUT0|"""Western Mass News spoke with AIC economics professor John Rogers via Zoom, getting inside on what has unfolded in the stock market since Wednesday."
BEAR1|You saw on Wednesday the market went down significantly.
BULL2|Yesterday it came back up.
BEAR3|Today, the futures are down.
NEUT4|He explains.
BULL5|It all comes as new apps like Robin Hood are paving the way for smaller investors to break into the market.
NEUT6|I would say this particular phenomenon is it's been around for a little while, but it's it's really coming into its own.
NEUT7|An it's an opportunity for you if you like democratized the market.
NEUT8|People can just go on their Robin Hood platform on their cell phone and trade stocks.
NEUT9|They don't need to go through a major brokerage firm.
NEUT10|They're also trying to basically.
NEUT11|Make a statement, stick it to the Wall Street hedge funds who are driving the stock down with short selling.
BEAR12|These people are driving it up, causing the Wall Street firms to lose money because of the sudden stock battle Thursday.
NEUT13|The app took steps to stop the war.
BEAR14|This thing turned into a frenzy and as a result of that people got scared and they said, well, we should suspend trading in these stocks temporarily, but that move by Robin Hood opened another can of worms.
BEAR15|As investors claim the app rigged the market against its customers in favor of larger hedge funds, but they brought all these small investors into the market and now they've stopped the training so the small investors are mad at them.
BEAR16|And while trading is once again open on Friday, questions remain on what this app will do to the markets.
NEUT17|Long term.
BEAR18|This is a bit of a fad.
NEUT19|Somebody gets the idea that this stock is undervalued or overvalued and they start piling on and it turns into a bubble and.
BEAR20|Bubble bursts and people get hurt.
BEAR21|They get mad.
NEUT22|They file lawsuits, but I don't think it's it's gonna have that much impact on the broader market.
NEUT23|Western mass news.
NEUT24|Also, ask Professor Rogers if now is the time to invest or stay away from the market.
NEUT25|There are lot of imponderables out there but that's the nature of markets and so if you have a long term view, if you believe in the future of the US economy or the global economy, you're going to do well by being an investor.
NEUT26|But she can't.
NEUT27|Expect to strike it rich quick for Western mass news.
NEUT28|"I'm Sabrina Riley."""
