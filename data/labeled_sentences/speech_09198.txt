NEUT0|"""First, I want to come and take a look at a chart here that I'm showing inside my terminal to technical chart, but I think the theme really is we've been in this trading range were not overbought at these levels, but that key 8000 level means we could be breaking out of this trading range."
NEUT1|Do you see the price increase recently as technically driven?
NEUT2|Yeah, so great question actually obviously not technical trader, but again the technical and high frequency trading is really what drives this market in Bitcoin and anytime you have an unforeseen circumstance.
NEUT3|Like the Iran incident that happened a couple of days ago.
BULL4|That adds some new buyers in the market.
BULL5|They weren't expecting that and that bumps it up and that way to bump actually in buying pressure really drives it to be up next.
BULL6|You know, 20% in two days so I am shocked to hear that it's moving higher with gold and seen as a safe haven.
NEUT7|How is that possible?
NEUT8|Yeah, so every couple of years we have these events.
NEUT9|I remember about four years ago.
NEUT10|The grease incident Bitcoin became a safe haven for that actually.
NEUT11|So we see that happen a lot now.
NEUT12|I don't think people actually went and sold their GE stock and all that and bought Bitcoin.
NEUT13|But I see what happens is just a little bit of people start buying Bitcoin and that with the technical trading really bumped it up and makes it go higher a lot faster.
NEUT14|What are some of the fundamentals behind Bitcoin going higher in 2020?
NEUT15|Yeah, so you know, it's funny.
NEUT16|A year ago I was on the show exactly the same time and I predicted when Bitcoin was only 3500 that it would hit close to $15,000 and it actually did pretty much and this year, you know I'm going to make a prediction.
NEUT17|I think Bitcoin passes the all time high and goes past 20,000 this year, how, why?
NEUT18|What's driving that?
BEAR19|And a lot of people think it's going to be because of having and that's it happens in May, where the supply of Bitcoin will drop in half, but I think that's already factored in alot.
BEAR20|Bitcoin again goes up high when the unforeseen things happen.
NEUT21|So last year the catalyst behind that was we were happening with Facebook.
BULL22|No one saw that coming and that really made it go up fast this year.
NEUT23|Again, things like China, Russia, India could legalize Bitcoin.
NEUT24|Some new companies, competitive Facebook and get involved.
NEUT25|The American government could do something, something unforeseen that could happen will really move it.
NEUT26|Faster, but fundamentally, we've already seen Fidelity launched their product squares, hired 5 engineers are in the Bitcoin trades Bitcoin side actually.
NEUT27|So all these large tech companies are already getting this space actually, so I think you'll start seeing those type of products coming to market too.
BULL28|"But it's gonna be unforeseen thing, I think, which happens every year, which will really make it go up fast and far."""
