NEUT8|Gentle tease.
NEUT9|Kathy Hernandez joining us live from the University of Houston, where she spoke with an economics professor about all of this.
NEUT10|Kathy good morning.
BEAR11|Well, good morning, the Dow opened this morning, 567 points down, but it has started its recovery process even with the record lows.
NEUT12|Yesterday, a professor here at U of H says no one should panic but as an individual investor we shouldn't be too worried.
NEUT13|And a year and a half from now or so, the stock market is going to make up the loss.
NEUT14|Most likely that's a word from longtime U of H economics professor Doctor Steven Craig.
NEUT15|That was the opening Bell Tuesday, a day after a brutal day on Wall Street.
BEAR16|The Dow tumbled the record 1175 points on Monday, the 4.6% plunge was the indexes worst day since August 2011 and knocked it into the red for the year.
BEAR17|That drop is due to concerns over rising interest rates and wages and high inflation.
NEUT18|Doctor Steven Craig says the main role in any investment just to be patient, which is hard when you have stuff like this at 5%.
NEUT19|Oh no, but a year ago it still up, and so you know, that's where the patience comes.
NEUT20|I.
NEUT21|And Doctor Craig says another reason, maybe the tax cut from the federal government.
BULL22|Just as the economy was starting to do well, many financial analysts had said this was coming.
