NEUT0|"""Both of you are significant holders of Bitcoin."
NEUT1|Buying a significant amount back.
NEUT2|In 2013 Tyler, I'll start with you.
BULL3|What have you been doing over the last eight months to accommodate this meteoric rise we've seen in Bitcoin?
BEAR4|And have you been personally doubling down on your investment in Bitcoin?
NEUT5|So we've just been hodling our thesis is that Bitcoin is Gold 2.0 that it will disrupt gold, and if it does that, it has to have a market cap of nine trillion.
NEUT6|So we think that prices Bitcoin at it could price one day at $500,000 of Bitcoin.
NEUT7|So at $18,000 Bitcoin it's a hold, or at least if you don't have any, it's it's a buy opportunity because we think there's a 25X from here.
BULL8|In it, 500,000 within the next decade, that means that Bitcoin would appreciate about 45 times from where it is right now.
NEUT9|If I'm doing the math correctly, Cameron worth around $9 trillion.
NEUT10|I mean, so basically, you're saying that Bitcoin could be about 40% of the market cap of the S&P 500.
NEUT11|I mean, what takes us there?
NEUT12|What's what's the bull case?
NEUT13|I think a lot of it is just investors coming in and realizing that inflation there's a specter of inflation out there and that how do you protect against ***?
BEAR14|I think there's not much of a debate on all the debt that's increased in the US.
NEUT15|The money printing, and so how do you defend against that?
BULL16|And I think a lot of people are starting to realize that Bitcoin is really the best defense and offers the opportunity for an asymmetric return of something like 25 to 40 X from here.
NEUT17|And I don't think there's an asset.
NEUT18|In the universe that can credibly offer that kind of potential and protect against inflation golds, the classic hedge.
NEUT19|If this was the 1970s, we would probably be buying and holding gold.
NEUT20|But today we have.
BULL21|Bitcoin is the best performing asset of the previous decade.
BULL22|"It's the best performing asset of this year and we think it will be the best performing asset of the current decade."""
