NEUT0|"""Where do we see Bitcoins price going next?"
BULL1|I was really astonished by, you know, we have low volumes between Christmas and New Year's yet Christmas Eve to Sunday it Rose, or over 20% breaching that 28,000 I mean, can this actually last?
NEUT2|Yeah, The funny thing with Bitcoin is that there's no market open market closed for cryptocurrencies trades 24/7 somewhere.
BULL3|And as you say, you know really spiked over the holiday weekend, I think there's probably like like there often is a lot of discussion around dinner tables around that time about cryptocurrencies, and it was able to the top that 28,000 level.
NEUT4|You know, we love round numbers, so the next level we're kind of looking at here is the 30,000 level.
NEUT5|Which is really astonishing thinking about from where we started at the beginning of the year.
NEUT6|Talk to a source today who thinks that we're looking at 30,000.
NEUT7|Likely might be a near term top, but might not necessarily see the same kind of massive crash or sell off that we did when the bubble burst in 2017.
NEUT8|So we're talking maybe in the near term drops that maybe 10 to 15% rather than a really big crash like we did before.
NEUT9|It's kind of uncharted territory that we're in now, and it's a dangerous game to try to put a put a pin to pin on it, or put a number on it at this point.
NEUT10|Can point to a recent survey from Deutsche Bank.
BULL11|40% of survey respondents expect Bitcoin to be higher next year.
NEUT12|In the range of 20,000 to just under $50,000.
NEUT13|So that's a rough area of thinking about it.
BULL14|Another 12% actually see crossing $100,000, which again sounds pie in the Sky.
NEUT15|But hey, you know we're talking about 30,000 now, and that's relatively within earshot.
NEUT16|Considering again where we started the year, right around 3, three, $4000 suddenly doesn't sound so crazy.
NEUT17|What about other assets compared to Bitcoin?
NEUT18|Everyone loves to compare to Goldman's calls Bitcoin the millennial gold but gold right now is trading under 1900 this summer.
BULL19|It did very well, almost close to 2100.
NEUT20|How did Bitcoin compare with other assets?
NEUT21|Just doesn't seem like anyone any other asset can really keep up with the momentum that Bitcoin has.
NEUT22|Yeah, I mean when you look at you know asset classes, certainly there's not really any real good comparison of Bitcoin.
BULL23|Gold is up about 25% this year, which you know pales in comparison to Bitcoins almost 300% gain, you know.
NEUT24|Looking for games like that, you're talking about individual stocks or speculative assets at that point.
BEAR25|So really has been a monster year for Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies as well.
NEUT26|At this point of the year, you know we're winding down.
BEAR27|We've seen it drop a little bit.
NEUT28|You're still those kind of concerns about regulatory issues that are constant worry for cryptocurrencies, but longer term.
BULL29|"Again, one of the big changes from 2017 till now is that we have seen the entry or the start of entry of the institutional investors and that has made a difference from back in 2017."""
