NEUT0|"""Let's look at the PC."
NEUT1|What is GPC?
NEUT2|Paul Genuine Parts Company?
NEUT3|Next there X there my profit marketing 3% dividend.
BULL4|So with the company that dropped so much we want to make sure the dividend is sustainable.
NEUT5|So the big factor here there are $15 billion companies spend about $450,000,000 a year on their dividend, but something to keep in mind.
BULL6|So ** so far revenue growth check Mark Big jumps here with their acquisitions.
NEUT7|What's the deal?
BEAR8|They had 9200 stores that might be hard.
NEUT9|Who knows about profit growth?
NEUT10|Pillar #4 Paul Pillar number for proper growth.
BEAR11|Down over the last five years, number of shares outstanding.
BULL12|Check Mark 152 to 145 current assets over over our current liabilities is pulling number 67.4 versus 6, so check Mark there nice how about free cash flow growth Paul 1.0 five 786-6780 so point 781.05 point 78.66 point 9 and .6 it's 4 / 5 is .8 * 20.
NEUT13|Selling for less.
NEUT14|It's selling for less than the number, but this is parts guys.
NEUT15|This is autumn apart.
NEUT16|Automobile Parts Co self over 9800 stores worldwide, most of which are in oh independently owned.
NEUT17|So anything in retail guys specialty retail, which is good if you want it on their gross profit 35% you want to understand what they're doing and let's see their quarterly sales compared to last year.
NEUT18|Actually not that bad.
NEUT19|Not that far down makes you guys were smashed in like we love you watching.
NEUT20|It's incredible.
BULL21|Thanks guys.
NEUT22|Massive loss in the second quarter which which in the second quarter the year which makes sense?
NEUT23|Yeah, this one is interesting.
NEUT24|What was the average amount of castles in 100,000,000 and their dividends 450?
BEAR25|So the cash flow was decreasing.
NEUT26|I think wasn't it or was it increasing?
BEAR27|It was decreasing, so that's something to watch out for.
BEAR28|The cash flows down 30 or 40% in the last five.
NEUT29|So maybe pay multiple, much lower.
BEAR30|Maybe going to buy it for like $10 billion as a company or some like that, 'cause the Castle is decreasing in an already hard market with a very big footprint.
BEAR31|It's going to be very difficult to get out of that out of that problem.
NEUT32|So this is what I'd be cautious on.
NEUT33|I'm not saying avoided, but with retail with low profit margin.
NEUT34|Such a big footprint and it being an automotive, it's kind of hard.
NEUT35|"Of course there's no yes or no just from the qualitative aspects that are completely."""
