NEUT0|"""Are these all ranked in sort of order of importance in terms of their size and scope for for the company next year, or is there one in particular that stands out to you?"
NEUT1|Well Kelly, happy Holidays to you and everyone we do want to note of these five reasons.
NEUT2|Importantly, they're actually listed in near term catalyst first.
NEUT3|An longer term catalyst further down, so not necessarily in magnitude, but timing.
BULL4|'cause as you correctly stated, with this stock up 70% in 2020, we wanted to be clear that we still see upside in 2021 and in order of priority and preference of what's coming up is this holiday season.
BEAR5|Christmas next week and most of Apple products are selling out, and that's a good problem for them to have, which we think brings the demand forward into the March quarter.
NEUT6|So yes, there's five items, but they're actually listed in order of what we think the timeline of for them to occur.
NEUT7|Got it so on the on the shortages issue that you mentioned.
NEUT8|You say the iPhone 12 Pro, the 12 Pro Max were sold out the iPad Pro, the iPad Air, the Mini all sold out the MacBook Air.
NEUT9|The pro that iMac Pro in the iMac all sold out.
NEUT10|The Home Pod Mini all sold out.
NEUT11|So as we move beyond that then we start to get into the India footprint.
NEUT12|Tell us why you think that's going to be a big catalyst for the stock.
NEUT13|You bet so when we first had a buy rating years ago on China and we said China is going to big be a big market opportunity.
NEUT14|Many people pushed back and said, you know, Jim Suva.
BEAR15|We really think you're crazy 'cause the disposable income isn't big enough there.
BULL16|And we soon realized that as the China market evolved in the economy strengthened, Apple became a very big footprint there in India.
BULL17|Just to let you know, right now, Apple has less than 2% their tiny there and we see over time it growing.
NEUT18|Reason why it's important to directly answer your question.
NEUT19|Kelly is in India.
NEUT20|If you produce locali you get a tax shelter.
NEUT21|In other words, if you import something which Apple is doing currently, you get faced with an about 30% duty tariff import tax.
NEUT22|That means your product becomes 30% more expensive.
NEUT23|Also today Apple does sell some of its lack legacy product such as the Apple SE which are sold a much more lower priced affordability.
NEUT24|We see in the years ahead when people ask, where else can Apple grow?
BULL25|India is going to be an important market for Apple.
NEUT26|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT27|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
