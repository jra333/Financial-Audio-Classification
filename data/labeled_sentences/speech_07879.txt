NEUT0|"""If you are following the soap opera that continues to be we work."
NEUT1|We got some news late yesterday.
NEUT2|We worked executive Chairman Marcelo Claure a saying that a Wall Street Journal conference that that famous consulting agreement you might remember with founder of we work Adam Neumann.
BEAR3|He says it's over Korea saying quote, I think Adam may have violated some parts of the consulting agreement, so that is no longer in effect.
NEUT4|He didn't elaborate on how the agreement was violated saying was part of a continuing.
NEUT5|Litigation effort and Newman's exit package included $185 million.
NEUT6|Four consulting the Wall Street Journal, reporting that Newman did not receive that entire amount, though it's worth noting, given the shares that he had in the company he took, he got about a billion dollars of stock, but $500 million also refinanced loss.
NEUT7|Now it looks like the $185 million, but I should also mention guys he is back.
NEUT8|I don't know if you've seen this.
NEUT9|He invested about $30 million in Alfred, which is involved in the dog walking business I.
NEUT10|We've just about about a week ago, so he does that make him a major investor, or he's just kind of riding along back on the pedal.
NEUT11|Next does that make him a major investor where he actually gets some say in the game?
NEUT12|Or is he just kind of riding along on somebody else's thing?
NEUT13|I don't know that's a good question.
NEUT14|He invested $30 million.
NEUT15|It's it's.
NEUT16|It's the Alfred club.
NEUT17|It's it's part of this real estate effort that sort of is a white glove helping service of sorts.
NEUT18|I'm not sure what his role he's not.
NEUT19|He's not operating the business, that's for sure.
NEUT20|But he is investing in that and he's invested in a number of other buildings in New York and other places, so I don't think Adam Newman is going away quietly.
NEUT21|How about that?
NEUT22|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
