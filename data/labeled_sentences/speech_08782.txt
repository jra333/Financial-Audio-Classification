NEUT0|"""But there is a story right now on Yahoo Finance's webpage."
BEAR1|Yahoo finance.com three major risks to your searching stock portfolio in 2021.
NEUT2|That's a Brian Sozzi story.
NEUT3|Emily McCormick is here because Emily's been working on a story about the bull case for stocks in 2021.
NEUT4|Phyllis, in 'cause I think we like to be optimistic.
NEUT5|Absolutely Adam and just taking a look at what Wall Street firms have been saying about 2021.
BULL6|Really, there is an overwhelming wave of optimism heading into next year.
NEUT7|I took a look at a dozen 2021 market outlooks from firms and I compiled those for Yahoo Finance and I found that every single one of those strategists actually believes that stocks are going to end next year higher than they are right now in their base case assumptions.
NEUT8|Now, some are more bullish than others and the most bullish firm so far is JP Morgan.
NEUT9|Now that from his set a price target of.
BULL10|4400 for the S&P 500 with potential downside to 4200 but upside to as high as 4600 by year and next year.
BULL11|Now that base case assumption for JPMorgan again at 4400 would imply appreciation of another about 18% from the S&P 500's recent record, closing high of a bit over 3700 from last week.
NEUT12|Now, for context, the median price target for the S&P 500 is 4150.
NEUT13|Among those dozen strategists.
NEUT14|And then taking a look time last year, JP Morgan did see stocks and the S&P 500 specifically ending 2020 at 3400, which had been right around the median of analysts expectations at the time.
BULL15|So JP Morgan hasn't always been necessarily the most bullish, but did come out on top this year.
NEUT16|Now.
NEUT17|JP Morgan's upbeat assessment for next year is really based on a few key assumptions.
NEUT18|The first being that central banks will continue to tilt towards easy monetary policy, the second being that vaccine distribution.
NEUT19|Will go smoothly and then third of all that lawmakers in Washington will face a divided government scenario after we get those Georgia Senate runoffs in the next couple of weeks.
NEUT20|So the outcome of that is still of course hang in balance and could be a downside risk here in the near term, but overall those are the assumptions that JP Morgan has an many other strategists too.
NEUT21|At one key quote here from JP Morgan really sums up their outlook.
NEUT22|They wrote in a note quote.
BULL23|The equity market is facing one of the best backdrops for sustained gains in years after prolonged period of elevated risks.
NEUT24|Global trade war COVID-19 pandemic, US election uncertainty, etc.
BULL25|The outlook is significantly clearing with the business cycle expanding and risks diminishing.
BULL26|Now they also said that they expect a quote market Nirvana scenario for equities, mostly in the first half of next year, with perhaps a little bit more subdued gains in the second half.
BULL27|Once we get this optimism around the vaccine priced in and also once we start getting some more guidance out from central bank officials, including from the Fed about forward guidance on where interest rates and perhaps quantitative easing is heading.
BULL28|But overall again, quite a bit of optimism here on Wall Street and especially coming from JP Morgan, Adam, and Julia.
NEUT29|Well, you always have to take it with a grain of salt because even the analysts get it wrong, but they keep their jobs and they get to reissue what they said.
NEUT30|OK, Emily McCormick.
BULL31|"Thank you very much."""
