NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol Na KD."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, this levels this won't let me take a step back if you watch past videos before you probably know right where I'm headed with this so it'll make a little bit more sense.
NEUT5|But if you haven't watched any past videos I've been talking about that Purple line quite a bit, which on my chart denotes the very one on the very famous 50.
NEUT6|Moving average.
BEAR7|And yeah, as of now, that level just continues to behave in a very, very annoying manner as it just angles down here and the price just can't quite seem to get above it.
BEAR8|I mean, recently there from a few days ago Price tried to, but got, you know, immediately rejected at that level.
NEUT9|So the point here being, if you almost invisible envision this is kind of an invisible force that's you know that purple line is exerting on the price.
NEUT10|It just keeps slowly pressing the price lower and lower downwards, and at this point while nothing is guaranteed, I don't think anybody would be shocked to see this area of support now come into play there down there at the 69 cent mark.
NEUT11|If you go through the history of things you can see acted as support acted as support.
NEUT12|So again nothing is guaranteed.
NEUT13|But like that it doesn't have to travel that far before doing battle with it.
NEUT14|Which brings about a big question mark going for it is OK if the price goes down there.
NEUT15|Is it going to hold once again or could that potentially be a very significant breakdown?
NEUT16|And if it does break down to that level?
BEAR17|The next level of support, not until dawn, around 65, which again doesn't mean that if it breaks, it will drop straight down there, but at that point I don't think anybody would be shocked to see the price then just continue this drift down to at minimum the 65 cent mark.
BULL18|But to be fair, so far so good.
NEUT19|The price is holding above that initial green line, but because of that downwards pressure that seems be exerted by that purple line there.
NEUT20|It seems as though there's a chance.
NEUT21|That or I think, a higher chance than not.
NEUT22|Then it'll be tested, but who knows, maybe the thing decides all of a sudden come back to life again and explode upwards and get above that purple line.
NEUT23|So we'll see what happens.
NEUT24|You know what it decides to do moving forward here?
BULL25|But yeah, definitely things were looking shaky.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT28|But it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
NEUT37|Totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
