NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, welcome to the races at each other YouTube live."
NEUT1|I've got something really cool for you.
NEUT2|Let me switch your camera around.
NEUT3|I'm here in the beautiful mountains for a long weekend.
NEUT4|Look at this.
NEUT5|The color of that Lake.
BULL6|Absolutely gorgeous up here.
NEUT7|So good to clear your mind for a few days and really just just kind of chill back a little bit, but I wanted to go through something today.
NEUT8|I received an email yesterday from a client that was asking me if we were if the stock of Netflix was now toast.
NEUT9|And the reason the person was asking the question because we took profits on a swing trade we did and I'll show you that trade here in just a few minutes.
NEUT10|Or actually in just a second.
NEUT11|But The funny thing was I then followed up with the person and what he was confused on was was he was confusing trades with sort of a longer term horizon.
NEUT12|So this is all one of the most difficult things I think for people to understand so wanted to kind of take you through this and let me flip the camera around again.
NEUT13|Have a quick look at that view.
NEUT14|Right, so let's have a look at the computer here and what you can see.
NEUT15|This is the long term chart of Netflix, or at least the multiyear chart.
BEAR16|The stock company really hasn't been around that long, but obviously this is 1 hell of a chart and and some people are getting a little bit concerned about the steepness of of that slope and all that stuff, which certainly is understandable.
NEUT17|But we did earlier this week.
NEUT18|We bought the stock, I think at $333 or something like that.
NEUT19|On sort of, you know, when the stock sorta before it started breaking out and then we had a profit target.
NEUT20|At $350.00, which we which we took, and it really, it was just a tree.
NEUT21|That's all we were trying to do.
NEUT22|So the trade alert that we had sent out to people was this exact thing.
NEUT23|You can see we bought it at 3:33.
NEUT24|We closed the Denver at 3:50 here for profitable and factor 5% making five 1%.
NEUT25|But this person didn't really understand.
NEUT26|Was that just because I took this trade didn't mean that I need it to all the sudden become majorly bearish on a stock and I think that's one of the most difficult things for people to understand.
NEUT27|To differentiate between a long term view and a medium term view and the way that we do this for the most part, is by having positions in different time frames.
BULL28|So I actually own Netflix for the long term we own in their portfolios and I still think it will be a good buy for the long term if you have enough patience.
NEUT29|But that doesn't mean that you can't trade around it in the near term.
NEUT30|So let me let me go like this.
NEUT31|So so it's really important for people to understand that just because you are doing a trade that doesn't mean that you have to be.
NEUT32|All sudden bearish on a long term position, when you get out of that trade and vice versa just because you're buying a stock doesn't mean that you have to be super bullish on are all immediately in any in any different in any in any time frame for that matter.
NEUT33|So so yes, of course you know I do have my immediate term concerns about Netflix, which is why I took profits, but by no means does that mean that I think that the stock is now going to fall apart and is toast, and this is a great question by Jeffrey K. And so thank you for that question, Jeffrey.
NEUT34|We had a lot of people that made a lot of money we made.
NEUT35|As you saw, a quick 5% in the trade on the swing trading perspective with the stock and I think we may want to say 5th, 40 or 50% using the options that we that we offered 11 could buy.
NEUT36|So anyways I'm going to leave you with just a little bit more of this.
NEUT37|Absolutely fantastic view.
NEUT38|I wish everyone a wonderful long weekend, at least those of you that are going to take Monday off.
BEAR39|'cause U.S. markets will be closed on Monday.
NEUT40|So with that have a wonderful weekend and I'll see you guys next week.
NEUT41|"Take care."""
