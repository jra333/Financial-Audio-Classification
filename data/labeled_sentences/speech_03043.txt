NEUT3|Let's talk about this stocks.
NEUT4|Why I'm looking at Facebook right now.
NEUT5|It's just looking like a really good deal right now.
BEAR6|This is so low.
NEUT7|Look at that now.
NEUT8|He spent six months climbing all the way back up to 220 just to go back down to 170.
NEUT9|So right now I would love the graph.
NEUT10|Some of these, but I'm I'm curious as to.
BULL11|From here you can see that we're almost back at the original support level an.
BULL12|I mean, I would love to climb back up there guys with this company.
NEUT13|I mean I would love to climb back up there, but when is it going to climb back up?
NEUT14|Is it going to take?
NEUT15|It's going to take some time?
NEUT16|I mean, if this recession is really going to be a recession.
BEAR17|If this is going to be recession, it might hurt these stocks for a little while.
NEUT18|But then they might start recovering it right away.
NEUT19|And this is a really big deal.
NEUT20|So for me, I'm like there's ever any good time to start buying.
NEUT21|It would be now for me.
NEUT22|I would start buying Facebook.
NEUT23|What are you doing?
NEUT24|Are you going to buy Facebook?
NEUT25|Are you thinking about buying some of those?
BULL26|These are pretty good stocks and they look like they're going to grow all the time.
NEUT27|So I'm thinking about grabbing a few shares at ease to write up my growth account on 'cause I'm building a growth portfolio as well, and so I just.
BULL28|I think I'm going to grab some need to hold on to him because these are definitely going to grow.
BULL29|This is definitely a good price to grab him at.
NEUT30|I feel like.
NEUT31|You know, if I if I was holding on to these before then I'd be kinda upset, but since it's back down and I haven't bought any, I've now is a good time for me to grab something.
NEUT32|So I'm just looking at a bunch of stocks that I feel like make it, you know, make my cut for stocks that I would buy that are like really cheap right now, so don't let me know in the comments below.
NEUT33|What do you think about Facebook?
NEUT34|You guys?
NEUT35|Anybody on Facebook?
NEUT36|How many shares you have?
NEUT37|Is this a good time to buy it or should we be waiting on lower levels to come and look at the five year chart?
BEAR38|It looks like I mean Facebook obviously go lower.
NEUT39|Going from 820 eighteen to 2019.
BEAR40|They dropped all the way down and 1:20 even we touch 120 support.
NEUT41|So I mean we want 70.
BEAR42|I mean maybe she could go lower.
NEUT43|Maybe you can go down in one.
NEUT44|I don't know what one.
NEUT45|1:40 and 1:20.
BEAR46|I mean we if we can get the price down even more of even better, but I'm not sure what it would take and what what's going to cause it to drop even further.
NEUT47|Is it going to be more of a crash?
BEAR48|Is more points going to fall off the dial?
NEUT49|I mean I don't know.
NEUT50|So you guys let me know what are you thinking.
BULL51|This chart looks pretty good.
BULL52|I'm looking at this is a pretty good deal but maybe not as good as the deals we had right here.
NEUT53|In 2018 going to 2019, that's probably the best deal.
NEUT54|And maybe this is the second best deal you can get.
NEUT55|Since this pretty high up from there.
NEUT56|I mean once it recovers is going to go much higher from there is going to be hitting, you know, going towards a $300 range $400 range so I don't know.
NEUT57|I'm I'm thinking this is a good stock.
NEUT58|I'm going to grab some.
NEUT59|Like I said, not gonna grab too many times you can grab enough to look at it and hold onto it in My Portfolio.
NEUT60|Just let My Portfolio be diversified a little bit so you guys let me know what you doing.
NEUT61|"Alright guys, talk to you later, peace."""
