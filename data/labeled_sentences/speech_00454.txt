NEUT0|"""How would this help solve bangs?"
NEUT1|$41 billion rescue package?
NEUT2|Or by selling about $14 billion of Alibaba shares that would help form about a third of the rescue package for SoftBank.
NEUT3|Apart from that, SoftBank were told they are also planning to sell shares and its local telecoms business, and also States and Sprint.
NEUT4|So together it will form a $41 billion rescue package if you call it and together, they will use that money to buy back shares in SoftBank Group.
NEUT5|And what effect would this have on Alibaba you think?
NEUT6|So $14 million if you look at the market cap of Alibaba, about 47 billion 470 billion, that's about 3% four percent of its of its entire market cap.
NEUT7|As of yesterday.
NEUT8|We already saw the market price them.
NEUT9|Part of that effect felt more than 7% here in Hong Kong.
BULL10|And overnight about 4% in the US.
NEUT11|So I think market has largely priced in those those effects for the sell off.
NEUT12|Also, Alibaba announced last year that they are implementing a 6 billion buyback plan over the next to you.
NEUT13|Years, so that is probably going to help stomach some of that impact as well, but those plans were definitely announced before the $14 billion share fell.
BEAR14|So there's been a lot of critics out there recently when it comes to SoftBank.
NEUT15|Do you think this is enough to silence those critics?
NEUT16|SoftBank, right now.
NEUT17|I think if you look at NASA's plan, I think he's still very long in terms of the sharing economy, especially in ride hailing mistakes and BD trouble seeing, and also a quite a mother of rivals for DD globally.
NEUT18|He still pretty much betting big on these businesses.
NEUT19|I think the whole we work, Oyo, unraveling of these companies is still in the process.
BEAR20|We're still seeing a lot of the fallout from that and pad so.
NEUT21|"It's far too early to say if SoftBank is out of the Woods just because of this 41 billion buyback."""
