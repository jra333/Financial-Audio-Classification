BULL0|"""Yeah Sean, interesting quarter here for Apple."
BEAR1|The stock looks like it's down a couple of percentage points in the initial after hours trading session.
NEUT2|Let's get to the numbers from Apple, again beating on the bottom line.
NEUT3|$0.73 per share.
BULL4|That's better than the $0.70 that was expected by the Street total revenues $64.7 billion.
BULL5|Better than these 63 1/2 that the street was looking for.
NEUT6|But the miss here is an iPhone revenues $26.44 billion in iPhone revenue during the company's fiscal fourth quarter.
NEUT7|St was looking for right around 27.
NEUT8|Point 1 billion.
BULL9|Now it's not surprising they miss and we have a new iPhone coming out and some comments from Tim Cook in the release saying they've seen a tremendous response to the new device, which of course they announced earlier this month.
BEAR10|But that seems to be weighing on the stock here.
BULL11|Just going through a couple other segments of Apple's business iPad revenues $6.8 billion, better than 6.1 the Street was looking for Mac revenues, beating by a billion dollars 9 billion in the company's most recent quarter, and the wearables?
NEUT12|ETC line that includes watch the the air pods.
NEUT13|All that stuff.
NEUT14|$7.88 billion in the most recent quarter.
NEUT15|7.35 is what the street was looking for.
BULL16|So overall services revenue beating expectations by about $700 million.
NEUT17|Fourteen .55 billion in the company's most recent quarter.
BEAR18|But again, that Apple revenue number just slightly lagging estimates and does look like that is dragging down the stock here off about 5% in the after hours.
NEUT19|And guys so interesting is Miles highlighted the iPhone numbers here because for how long have we talked about anticipating the 5G iPhone which now is long last coming and it's right around the corner and the bowls on Apple moving their narrative to services.
NEUT20|Don't worry about the iPhone sales.
NEUT21|How about services?
NEUT22|So sure enough that the earnings note here leads with records for Mac and for services.
NEUT23|And by the way, Speaking of services and be very interested to hear about how that Apple One bundle that's being introduced is doing what the company thinks about that because that.
NEUT24|Talked about on this show.
NEUT25|I just don't think that's very appealing.
NEUT26|If you already subscribe to, say, Spotify, you know you're not going to cancel Spotify to do Apple Music to bind to the Apple Bundle.
NEUT27|But let's hear bout that services being a new thing and then interesting to note that Tim Cook calls it the most prolific product introduction.
NEUT28|We've ever had.
NEUT29|Of course, the product introduction about to see that 5G iPhone, but I can just already hear the raging Apple bowls that we often have on our programming.
BEAR30|Saying don't worry about the iPhone numbers, that was because the upgrade cycle had slowed.
BULL31|Now that we're going to get the iPhone, all those people will finally upgrade.
NEUT32|It's all OK and look at the services so you know if you're an Apple you can kind of pick which thing you want to cherry pick and say is good news records for services records for Mac, it's interesting.
BEAR33|I knew something was up that they missed somewhere with the lead.
NEUT34|When you go with Services, anmc revenue like when is the last time we talked about the Mac like a desktop so it just shows you obviously that there's something in here.
NEUT35|It's not a huge miss, an iPhone, but this is the iPhone company.
NEUT36|I think we need to get more details on what's going on with the bundle.
NEUT37|As you said Dan.
NEUT38|And also this new fitness initiative.
BEAR39|We've seen a lot of delays for the watch and excitement over that we've seen what's been happening with pallet on so.
NEUT40|"Those are some areas that you're going to want to see, but I cannot believe I'm talking about the Mac."""
