BULL0|"""OK guys, welcome back to another video."
BULL1|So Tesla getting some pretty good news, especially how earnings yesterday was pretty nice.
BULL2|It was pretty bullish, everyones happy.
BEAR3|But of course Tesla stock is dropping, it's not hitting the red so far.
BEAR4|A tech just isn't really doing so well in the past couple of weeks because the stimulus and the upcoming election markets are pretty bearish.
NEUT5|But of course nothing is really fluctuate ING really big.
BEAR6|It's kind of a slow and steady drop, and with Tesla just simply being.
NEUT7|A little bit green today is pretty impressive, so what's going on with the overall stock?
NEUT8|So we're getting some pretty bullish remarks, especially how Tesla is selling a bunch of vehicles.
NEUT9|They're closing on half a million cars for 2020, and also a record number of cars delivered for quarter three or 2020 of 139 thousand vehicles.
NEUT10|Elon Musk on earnings yesterday even said that he wants to be aiming for 840,000 to 1,000,000 vehicles for 2021.
BULL11|Now you clearly see the stock is going higher because it's the best quarter ever, and Tesla said it's the fifth consecutive quarter.
BEAR12|That's profitable, earned about 331 million, or $0.27 per share, compared to $0.16 per share a year ago.
BULL13|That is pretty awesome, and the overall sales rose from 6.3 billion a year ago to 8.77 billion.
BULL14|And Tesla's momentum is unstoppable.
NEUT15|There's still going higher and higher, especially autopilot.
NEUT16|Driving, insurance and the right health service all rolling out, maybe late 2020 or 2021.
NEUT17|Last not least is the most important one, which is by Baird.
NEUT18|They pretty much is saying that Tesla is a must own stock and there finally bullish after a year of downgrades.
BEAR19|So these guys are pretty bearish on Tesla.
NEUT20|Until recently, the earnings report came out showing how they're profitable.
BULL21|Five consecutive quarters, $0.27 per share profit.
NEUT22|Over $0.16 per share last year.
BULL23|This is a rising tech company and student really well every single quarter, so the endless ad Bard finally said that they will be upgrading shares of Tesla and also lifted price target to $488.00 and they no longer bearish.
NEUT24|This is pretty big, especially how more and more of these hedge funds these big analysts out there are finally capitulating and saying that Tesla is a good company and they're going forward with it, so that's about it guys.
NEUT25|Thanks watching Khan blood, you guys want to get shares of Tesla?
NEUT26|Honestly, right now is the perfect time.
BEAR27|A special Teslas down like more than 5% in the past week and if I were you.
BULL28|I'd probably get in as soon as I can, especially with the consolidation of price.
NEUT29|We could be seen a break out very soon.
