NEUT0|"""OK, So what we've got here is the daily chart for Apple going from January through the Today, July 21st."
NEUT1|You can see again here.
NEUT2|This stock has been in a major uptrend all the way through here, OK, and what we've got is the stock coming out of a nice Cup with handle base right through here and starting a new uptrend going right through here.
NEUT3|OK, so you've got just a really powerful moving stock.
NEUT4|But here's the interesting thing.
NEUT5|If you're not in this company, or you're not in this stock, we're going through a really interesting flat base right through here, which means that we can start looking for some buy points which you want to do is you want to watch for the volume to be big right?
BULL6|Through here, as the company starts to break out to new highs.
NEUT7|But technically you have two by points here.
NEUT8|You can be buying off of a bounce on the 50 day moving average, which is right here, or what you can do is you can buy this on a breakout, which will be right up around the $280 mark.
NEUT9|One thing to keep in mind is keep an eye on the stock market.
BEAR10|Right now we're in a confirmed uptrend, but man, it feels awful fun.
NEUT11|Be out there.
NEUT12|It's like people want to sell right now.
NEUT13|So the bottom line, Apple fits all the criteria that we look for in a company, especially the new product feature.
NEUT14|What they're coming out with with this iPad is truly going to change technology, and so Apple is a is a major buy Canada candidate.
NEUT15|In our opinion.
NEUT16|We already own it and so we're holding it and we're looking to add to it.
NEUT17|But if you really want to follow the breakout rules, you're going to want to stay in an uptrend with the market and buy this stock as it crosses back through this high right here.
