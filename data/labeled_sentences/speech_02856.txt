NEUT2|UTMEU time it's a well we could read right here.
BULL3|It's a mobile device manufacturing company committed to providing cost effective products and solutions to customers globally.
NEUT4|And they announced an IPO.
BULL5|And it really shot up.
NEUT6|And let's take a look at some of the news here.
NEUT7|Who we got?
NEUT8|Get some you time news here.
BULL9|The stock more than doubles is now 2000% plus above its IPO price incredible.
NEUT10|Yeah, we keep going along here and we don't see any headlines here on marketbeat, but we keep looking.
BULL11|And once again it says right here, the shares are up over 1000% Tuesday yesterday.
NEUT12|And the company announced the pricing of an IPO Tuesday morning at $4 a share.
NEUT13|So if we take a look here at today.
BULL14|The stock more than doubles and is now 2000% above the IPO price.
BULL15|Incredible incredible.
NEUT16|So this stock had started at $4 a share.
NEUT17|Boom, what's it at right now?
NEUT18|Let's take a look at the charts.
NEUT19|But we don't have to go too far back here folks.
BULL20|Yesterday it was at four and finished at the high of.
BULL21|Well, pretty good hi there.
NEUT22|Looks like over $40.00 so.
NEUT23|That's huge.
BULL24|And the you know it's it's kind of kept its highs today.
BULL25|It hit 100% today it's.
NEUT26|It's now at 84% in an after hours.
NEUT27|Getting close to the final Bell here.
NEUT28|But we could tell today that it started off right here on this Gray bar and then dumped into the green, which was that much and then continued high and hit a high up here.
BULL29|At a high of $107.00 today, incredible.
NEUT30|So let's take a look at what's going on.
NEUT31|It's below the V Wopp the bollinger's.
NEUT32|It's it's starting to kiss the bottom side of the Bolinger.
BEAR33|The money flows down, which is all expected in after hours.
NEUT34|We're not getting a lot of buying right now.
NEUT35|We'll go back to 1:00 o'clock so we can see one o'clock well, 253 as far as we can go, but not a lot of buying to push the stock.
NEUT36|It doesn't have a lot of outstanding shares, I assume because it had a volume of only 7,000,000 today.
NEUT37|So that is a wild ride for probably a short flood.
NEUT38|I haven't checked that yet, but it really looks like it could be so.
BEAR39|Let's see, the Mac T is down pretty far on the 15.
NEUT40|But let's go out a little further here.
NEUT41|And yeah, let's see the 60 minutes.
NEUT42|It's definitely crashing, but the five minute?
BULL43|Starting recovery here in the five minute get 100% buying at this level.
NEUT44|And it's just not moving at all.
NEUT45|There's nobody buying it son, so it's settling.
NEUT46|Right now.
NEUT47|And I'm wondering what's going to happen tomorrow.
BEAR48|Is this not gonna dump or is it going to continue to go up?
NEUT49|I mean, it's incredible that a stock can go from $44 to 100.
NEUT50|In two days so.
NEUT51|I don't have any of this stock, but man, what do you see?
NEUT52|This one was today, folks.
NEUT53|Alright, hope you enjoy the review.
NEUT54|"Take care."""
