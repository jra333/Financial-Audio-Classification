BEAR0|"""It was right on point as to what we were expecting, because as you as you said date that was really poor retail sales investment already."
NEUT1|What it was?
BEAR2|I mean, second quarter was already really bad.
NEUT3|So nothing that we would not be expecting, and that's exactly the point the government did expect these figures.
NEUT4|But I have to say it 20 billion Hong Kong dollar budget is a joke is very small.
NEUT5|I can't think of a budget ever in any country in the world that is less than oh point 8% of GDP creating 2% of GDP growth.
NEUT6|I mean I'd like to see that report because that is impossible.
BULL7|So if the government really wants to see positive growth in Hong Kong, they better come with a big budget.
NEUT8|That is not a budget that will change the situation.
NEUT9|I'm sorry to say so now that the figures are there.
NEUT10|That are confirmed we are waiting for the real budget an as I have.
NEUT11|As I've already said.
NEUT12|Hong Kong has enough physical space to do so is probably the you know the city in the world with the largest fiscal space that I know of and it needs to be used as soon as possible.
NEUT13|Are there any bright spots?
NEUT14|Are things that we can do?
BEAR15|I mean, we had the three local banks yesterday cutting interest rates, but that was just moving in line with the FOMC because of the dollar peg.
NEUT16|Is there any good news here?
NEUT17|Yes, there is an I think HMA has them something really interesting.
BULL18|Important to create more liquidity in the Hong Kong dollar in the banking sector by reducing the capital surcharge that banks have to accumulate, basically allowing for hiver to be not as high as you know as we would have seen without that cut.
BULL19|So so actually it can make easy using macro Prudential tools to help the Hong Kong economy.
NEUT20|This is good news but we need to see more on the budget, frankly speaking.
NEUT21|Hi Elise here, it's Matt here joining the conversation from Singapore.
BULL22|The Hong Kong Government yesterday also said that there was no signs of things abating unless we get some big ticket stimulus items.
BEAR23|How long do you anticipate that will see these very weak growth numbers go on for?
NEUT24|Well, the very beauty of Hong Kong is that is such a flexible economy we should not forget that.
NEUT25|Prices start adjusted.
NEUT26|You know there's lots of of.
BEAR27|Lower prices in hotel.
NEUT28|All of.
NEUT29|I mean it's it's all coming down, which is of course bad news in the short run, but it's very good news in the in the long run, meaning that this economy cannot just negative shocks and therefore if we hopefully really.
BULL30|Hopefully we're to see and stopping violence and social unrest.
BULL31|I think the Hong Kong economy could recover very quickly.
NEUT32|First thing I would do if I were to have any decision on this matter is to really try to attract more foreign direct investment into Hong Kong.
BEAR33|With liberalization measures, you can think of many sectors in control will basically suffer from it, including supermarkets.
BULL34|Retail in general still closed competition, Hong Kong should open up to competition and thereby attracting very much needed foreign darling investment into the city.
NEUT35|Hey everybody, it's Hadley.
