NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this weird video chart on ticker symbol NFLX Netflix."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, quite the eventful day on Netflix with earnings not only from the price action standpoint, but as would be expected, just monster volume and more of the story.
NEUT4|A lot of eyeballs definitely be watching this moving forward, so let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT5|So the first area of support moving forward is what I would call the ideal Weekly one.
BULL6|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward.
BULL7|And yeah, ideally speaking, if the price was able to stay up here above.
BULL8|This 580 mark that would be fantastic.
BULL9|Sign of strength.
BEAR10|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that level, that does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL11|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Next level of support after that.
NEUT13|Would be down here around.
NEUT14|Let's see what is that the 565 mark?
NEUT15|So five 8565 to the near term levels and then taking a bigger step back and looking at things from the.
NEUT16|Overall point of view, that is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword without doubt being moving.
BEAR19|I understand the price is way up there.
NEUT20|This lines way down here but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant which is very helpful because when it comes to just gauging the health of the move, that right there being defined as the move, just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the bulls are in full health of older and full control.
NEUT21|Having us visualize that that is what is being represented ensure stable 580.
NEUT22|Or 565 would be fantastic.
NEUT23|However, from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the sharp as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|I want to say is this all time highs?
NEUT25|Let's check the daily timeframe here.
NEUT26|Yeah, I believe all time high so we're in good problem to have Blue Sky breakout territory, so it's one of those situations where you just kind of got to use your gut instincts.
NEUT27|But I don't think anybody's going to complain about being in Blue Sky breakout territory.
NEUT28|So from that angle things use those gut instincts.
BEAR29|But overall, what a monster day?
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL33|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
