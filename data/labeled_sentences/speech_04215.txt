NEUT0|"""Well, I gotta say that the company that that explains the Facebook result."
NEUT1|I think you gotta look at Apple on two friends.
NEUT2|First, the warning on the headwinds.
NEUT3|An ad targeting directly aimed at Apple's changes in the platform and also the spending newtech new talent.
NEUT4|That's the arms race coming with Apple around AR and VR.
BULL5|So very interesting given obviously a strong quarter.
NEUT6|But investors are paying attention to those two threats and I think you know apples behind both of them.
NEUT7|Is it a buying opportunity like it has been in the past?
BEAR8|Josh, whenever Facebook warns of headwinds coming, that's going to pressure its business and puts out a quarter like it just did.
NEUT9|So I I think with I think with Facebook.
NEUT10|What's interesting is they don't really have an issue.
NEUT11|Fundamentally, they're still making a ton of money.
NEUT12|The issue is more on optics and the overhang for what people think might eventually happen on the regulatory front.
NEUT13|The problem with that as a bear thesis is that that's always been the case.
NEUT14|We've been talking about that.
BEAR15|More regulation, more regulation for years now, like since before the 2016 election, that's been a supposed overhang.
NEUT16|So if you or somebody that missed Facebook and you want to get in.
NEUT17|Typically, after an earnings report when you've had a sell off, that's been the way to do it.
NEUT18|That being said though, one last word of caution at the end of the day, here's what's inescapable.
NEUT19|90% of Facebook's revenues are advertising 50% come from United States, 25% come from Europe like those are the numbers, and that's not changing.
NEUT20|Don't tell me about augmented reality.
NEUT21|Those are the actual numbers and Facebook, by the way, unlike Tesla topped on like August 1st, Facebook is like seven months since its last record high.
BEAR22|Tesla being down roughly the same amount after the close, keep in mind Tesla was 650 a month ago.
NEUT23|So like these are two very different setups for investors, and that's what the way I would phrase it.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
