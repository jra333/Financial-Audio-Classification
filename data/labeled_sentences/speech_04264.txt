BULL0|"""They spin things so well that stock value keeps rising."
NEUT1|I could see that yeah, that makes sense.
NEUT2|He then says that's why can stay high and even go up when they're losing money in so many areas.
NEUT3|They just need confidence they'll make money.
NEUT4|Actually will.
NEUT5|Generally that's a very good point.
BULL6|So even though they're losing money on their parks, they're losing money on their movies because they are able to somehow convince these fools to buy their stock.
BULL7|An increase its value.
NEUT8|It means what they can do is then they can periodically sell stock at high prices higher than what they originally had it for, and then essentially pay off whatever losses they have.
NEUT9|I would argue if you have anything in Disney stock units you should sell.
NEUT10|I'm not.
NEUT11|I'm not an expert, I'm not a financial expert, but I feel like anyone that's helping to prop up Disney at this point.
NEUT12|Unless you want to keep access and have maybe just a dollar in them.
NEUT13|So that way you could still somehow have access to the shareholder meetings I mean.
BEAR14|God, that's that's just.
NEUT15|That's just so slimy man.
NEUT16|That's just so slimy.
NEUT17|We need a major reform of our financial system here.
NEUT18|I mean, I think the game stock situation really showed us we need some reforms not to stop people like the like the redditors, but the stop these major corporations who are able to essentially either inflate their own stock or deflate other competition stock.
BEAR19|"I think it's disgusting."""
