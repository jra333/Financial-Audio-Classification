NEUT0|"""So guys, this Sunday night."
NEUT1|Welcome back to a new episode.
NEUT2|In this one we are looking at a new penny.
NEUT3|Stock is currently worth only two cent and we can see the name of this one is sells.
NEUT4|Servcorp cells is also known as creative media technology.
BULL5|Necessary medical technology Holdings and we can see that this company is up kind of significantly recently.
BEAR6|Ever since those highs over about three cents we can see now we're kind of leveling out.
BULL7|However, Friday was quite indicative of some potential growth.
NEUT8|On the horizon, the question for tonight's episode is are we actually going to see this one break pass three and go Passos previous highs which we saw you know before.
NEUT9|So of course all of that stuff and more is coming up in tonight's episode.
NEUT10|If it sounds like a plan goes, please do leave a like and subscribe.
BULL11|It would be massively appreciated as we are trying to grow the channel as fast as possible.
NEUT12|With that being said, guys if you would like to come talk to us on Discord, you can link to the discord is down in the description box.
NEUT13|And of course if you would like to become a channel member you can do that as well.
BULL14|It would be massively appreciated.
NEUT15|But yeah, basically sells is another one of these and medical or you know radical related stocks.
NEUT16|And if we do have a quick look by typing in CELZ and we can have a look at what the company does.
NEUT17|So of course we are doing this now on Yahoo Finance and we can see some results come up so when we go back to previous one which we were on and which is a bit more indicative of what the company does, we can see that creative medical technology Holdings through its subsidiary subsidiaries is basically a company which.
NEUT18|Engages in the stem cell research and developing applications to treat male *** ****** dysfunction and related issues.
NEUT19|So basically, the company was basically incorporated back in 1998 and is currently based in Phoenix, AZ.
NEUT20|So looking at this company honestly is a very interesting company.
NEUT21|I do find a lot of these medical companies very interesting actually because you know when we think about it.
NEUT22|If these products do end up working in a lot of instances, these companies will be on too.
NEUT23|Technologies are least products which are worth a lot of money, so of course right now this one is definitely start with big potential for the future.
NEUT24|But if you're gonna be like this one for big growth, I would personally say in my opinion and that growth is probably going to come over a more long period of time.
BULL25|But overall guys I can't see some more positivity potentially coming in the next week, and we could definitely touch three cent range again, but honestly with this company I think yes, the potential is there until we get this product out 100%, you know.
NEUT26|And.
NEUT27|Approved and all that kind of good stuff.
NEUT28|It is going to be sometime before this one takes a shoot up, which we could expect to see.
NEUT29|But honestly, if you are hopeful in this company if you are faithful in it, if you believe that has some big potential, maybe you could buy a small position and just see where you go.
NEUT30|But in my opinion if I was going to be buying this one, I would definitely consider it as more of one of the speculative plays rather than a big growth stock.
BULL31|Potentially so.
NEUT32|"Of course I hope you enjoy this opinion video guys, if you did, please do leave like and subscribe and I will see in the next one goodbye until then."""
