NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, I wanted to take a moment to give you my predictions for 2017."
NEUT1|In the United States, we're getting a new President, President Donald Trump, who happens to be real estate mogul.
NEUT2|Well, that's going to mean something for the real estate industry.
BULL3|I can tell you just from my own anecdotal evidence that my videos on real estate have gone up dramatically since he was elected president back in November.
NEUT4|Just this last year.
NEUT5|So what I've decided to do is give you a 2017 prediction of what I think is going to take place this year in real estate.
NEUT6|What I believe will happen is interest rates will rise.
BULL7|By at least a percent, I think by the end of the year, I think economic activity will increase.
NEUT8|I think people will start borrowing more money from their properties and real estate.
NEUT9|Investors will start buying more property and selling more property this year.
NEUT10|Now why do I say that?
BULL11|I think that the fervor that there is in real estate is starting to starting to come up.
NEUT12|It's going from tepid water to simmering and it's going.
NEUT13|It's going to boil in the next five years.
NEUT14|I think the reason for that is we have.
NEUT15|I've already started to hear commercials on the radio where people are saying hey borrow from your property and go buy fun toys.
NEUT16|When that happens, people do it.
NEUT17|They buy the.
NEUT18|Invariably they will buy stuff that they can't afford otherwise, and when they do that Spurs the economy.
NEUT19|And when the economy grows when there's more money in the economy, then people get excited.
NEUT20|And when they get excited, they start buying more stuff which includes real estate.
NEUT21|However, when the economy rises when more than when there's more money in the economy then the Fed says you know what?
NEUT22|Now is the time that we can kind of curb inflation because now there's more money curb inflation by raising interest rates.
BEAR23|Now raising interest rates usually puts a damper on house prices.
NEUT24|So as you as you raise interest rates, it lowers house prices typically.
NEUT25|However, if you have more economic activity, which means you have more jobs being created, which means you have more people with money in their pocket that now instead of renting or living with their parents, want to buy a house, you have now a more supply of buyers and or you have a greater supply of buyers, which means you have a greater demand for property.
NEUT26|However, you have a finite number of sellers right now.
BEAR27|The last couple of years the sellers have been really low, so low supply, high demand.
BEAR28|That causes prices to go up, and they've been going up for about 6% or more the last couple of years.
BULL29|I think this year we're going to see that we're going to see that continue.
NEUT30|I think the people that did buy over the last couple of years a couple of them are going to sell.
BULL31|However, I think that economic activity is going to go up.
BULL32|Interest rates will go up as interest rates go up to kind of maintain the house prices that we have, but you'll still see an increase of between 5 and 6% I believe, especially in the West where I live over this next year.
NEUT33|That's one year.
BULL34|I think there's going to be a fervor for purchasing property.
NEUT35|However, I think it's going to be most things like 2004, 2005 where everybody says, yeah, I'm thinking about buying a property next year, whereas all the investors will say it's time to buy right now.
NEUT36|So as far as me and my plan, my plan.
NEUT37|I plan on selling some property and buying some more this next year however.
NEUT38|We'll see, but that's my prediction.
BULL39|Interest rates up house prices up, job numbers up and house prices, even though they'll go up.
NEUT40|There will be some downward pressure so.
NEUT41|Take it for what you will.
BULL42|"Good luck."""
