NEUT0|"""OK, so let's explain what we have here."
NEUT1|We obviously have a let's chart of Coca-Cola.
NEUT2|It looks like, yes.
NEUT3|OK, So what I do is I look I'm a pattern Trader, so I just want to give an example of something here Coke is not on our list, it's something that we don't trade.
NEUT4|But I just when I was looking at this I wanted to show like the pattern.
NEUT5|If you look here you see a www.sotypicallywhen.
NEUT6|This is let me just make sure they can see is that that's this guy right here, right?
NEUT7|Yeah, exactly so this is what I call the peak right.
NEUT8|It's just like riding a large W, so this is the peak when it breaks that peak.
NEUT9|Then at that point in time I will go long and the anticipated target, which is why it ties back into the question you asked me earlier.
NEUT10|How long can I swing?
NEUT11|My target is going to be up in here because it usually hits out either.
NEUT12|As high as this high which is 49 or slightly lower, but you did slightly lower OK, so if you come in over the peak and I buy in here right 'cause this is a bullish engulfing pattern, then that means that I would be long 123456789 trading sessions.
NEUT13|So in that regard that swing would be 9 days.
NEUT14|To answer your question.
NEUT15|So this this is this is a daily not a minute.
NEUT16|I'm looking on this on the show you're looking at it daily.
NEUT17|Nickel analysis based on a daily and I trade off of the five minute.
NEUT18|OK, let me ask let me just make a get a clarity point.
NEUT19|So Nora referred to that green candle can you see that Nora as an engulfing candle just just quickly explain what engulfing means.
NEUT20|So they so folks know what that is.
NEUT21|OK, so right here you'll see a small red candle and then this next candle engulfs it takes over the price of the next candle.
NEUT22|OK, so.
NEUT23|Typically you need that to confirm and the next day it did.
NEUT24|That means it has to open higher trade higher it actually gapped up, and then trading time.
NEUT25|So wait are you?
NEUT26|Are you at once in golfing?
NEUT27|Are you long on this day or you along the next day?
NEUT28|Sorry well, this is where once I get over this peak right now.
NEUT29|This is where this is tide in from my system to the triggers, let's just say Coke is an issue.
NEUT30|And let's say the alt is 4486 or the buy right at that point in time.
NEUT31|I know between my technical analysis and W pattern, the fact that it went over the peak and if I can add one more element to it, which would be one of the triggers, then this is a trade that I'm going to prioritize and take first, and then also possibly size up.
NEUT32|"So that's how I use the combination of my system and then the trigger."""
