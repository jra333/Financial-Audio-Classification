NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
BULL1|We can see after the opening of the markets are negative, but then it's bounced back to the positive.
NEUT2|And so down to negative again.
NEUT3|And if we change charge into daily chart we can see.
NEUT4|Here we got a huge red candle with a long after.
BEAR5|It means a lot of selling pressure upset and we have touched the 10 days year may and unfortunately we have been dropped back.
NEUT6|To the point which we formed on the.
NEUT7|Denies of 11.
BEAR8|That's the formal point of the high, so if we cannot hold above this line as we see on this chart, then it means the option in China has been failed.
NEUT9|So in my opinion, is very.
BULL10|Important for us to hold above this level, we can see we're just hit here.
NEUT11|If we connect the line we can see that clearly clearly.
NEUT12|At this point, at this point, how the same level?
NEUT13|So let's wait and see what will happen.
BULL14|"Thank you."""
