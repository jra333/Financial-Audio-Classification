BEAR0|"""So breaking news just as a few hours ago, new charges have been brought up against Jews Lane Maxwell by the Southern District of New York."
NEUT1|Now every time I keep saying there won't be any new updates until July, there's new updates.
NEUT2|So I'm going to keep saying that.
NEUT3|So hopefully there is new updates, but this is crazy.
NEUT4|There's so many updates coming out about this story seemingly every day now.
NEUT5|Now.
NEUT6|I never really feel comfortable plugging any of my own stuff, but I do have a tick tock where I upload way more frequently and I talk about the same kinds of topics, current events, conspiracies.
NEUT7|So if you want to see me upload more.
NEUT8|Frequently go check me out on there at Dante Falasco and let's get into it.
BEAR9|So just Lane Maxwell hit with new *** trafficking charges.
NEUT10|This is just as of this was about 5:00 o'clock.
NEUT11|It's about almost 7:00 o'clock, so just about 2 hours ago, which is very recent federal prosecutors on Monday unveiled 2 new charges in the criminal case against Julian Maxwell.
NEUT12|And here are the two charges, *** trafficking, conspiracy and one count of *** trafficking of a minor.
BEAR13|And with these new charges, he now faces eight counts.
BEAR14|Indictment choose previously only charged with four relate to conspiracy to entice minors to travel and engage in illegal ****** acts and two counts of perjury for allegedly lying to prosecutors.
NEUT15|So if we click on the document here, we can say conspiracy to entice minors to travel, to engage in illegal *** acts.
NEUT16|Then we see count 2 enticement of a minor travel again, there's four of these counts.
BEAR17|Transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal ****** activity, *** trafficking, conspiracy, *** trafficking of a minor, perjury.
NEUT18|And perjury so the details of what is in these new charges.
NEUT19|It boils down to kind of two things.
NEUT20|First is that the original charges only said that she was engaging with Epstein.
NEUT21|Between right here you can see 1994 and 1997.
NEUT22|However, these new charges say that she was engaging up until 2004, so between 2001 and 2004, so that is a big, you know, addition of time.
BEAR23|Also, the indictment adds a new fourth victim who was approximately.
NEUT24|14 years old at the time and was recruited to provide Epstein with sexualized massages, which goes along with many of the stories we heard before, especially in the Epstein documentary on Netflix and the charge.
BEAR25|Also claims that the fourth victim was forced to engage in ****** acts with Epstein through multiple means, even though she knew they were under 18, and if we go to the CNBC article, we can see that Maxwell is also charged with perjury for allegedly lying during a deposition for a lawsuit filed by Epstein accuser, but it doesn't give a date for that, and Maxwell is slated, of course, for trial in July.
NEUT26|So I'm going to go out on a limb and say this, that yeah, we might not find out more until July.
NEUT27|But again, like I said, the more I say that, the more we find out.
BEAR28|So sadly, you know 'cause this whole case is very sad.
NEUT29|We're probably going to find out more in July, but July this trial is just going to be very, very interesting.
NEUT30|So like I said, if you enjoy hearing about this kind of stuff, make sure you subscribe to the channel and my tick tock I'm going to be uploading shorten version of this video on Tick Tock and I cover a lot of stuff.
NEUT31|As you can see, I covered the little Nas X stuff.
NEUT32|I covered the.
NEUT33|The Evergreen thing I kind of not debunked it, but I railed people that thought there were children on that boat, which is just absurd, but I cover a lot of different things on here, so if you want to see that, check it out.
NEUT34|"First link in the description and I will see you next time."""
