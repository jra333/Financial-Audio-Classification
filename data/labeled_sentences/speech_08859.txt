NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, this is Jay here from stock without filling Academy."
NEUT1|And we are probably going to look at Amazon today.
NEUT2|So.
BULL3|Amazon has been a pretty bullish run from a long time.
NEUT4|And this is a monthly chart of Amazon.
NEUT5|You can see.
BULL6|It has grown tremendously over the past years.
NEUT7|And now.
NEUT8|Amazon is at these levels.
NEUT9|Currently at trading at three 114.
NEUT10|So.
NEUT11|What I can see here is Amazon after this drop.
NEUT12|It's kind of fitting in sideways right now.
NEUT13|So.
NEUT14|What I have done is I have drawn two zones here.
NEUT15|Two ranges in which we can enter the trade.
NEUT16|And if I look at my key chart, we don't get much information about what to do in Amazon right now.
NEUT17|So.
NEUT18|Let me switch this to weekly chart.
NEUT19|So that you can see.
NEUT20|Clear range that I'm talking about.
NEUT21|As you can see I have drawn.
NEUT22|Vic of the scandal.
NEUT23|A public of the scandal has one range.
NEUT24|Then I have gone lower mikoff this candle as the bottom range.
NEUT25|So idea here to trade in Amazon is to like.
NEUT26|Buy it when.
NEUT27|It reaches this zone and sell it when it reaches the zone.
NEUT28|So.
NEUT29|Till we have a clear cut breakout.
NEUT30|Either by of the zone or of the zone.
NEUT31|We cannot make a conclusive decision on Amazon right now.
NEUT32|And as you can see, Amazon today.
NEUT33|Looks like.
BEAR34|Approval fall down further.
NEUT35|From this contraction levels here.
NEUT36|OK, so.
NEUT37|That is my update on Amazon stock for now, and clearly clearly it is in a sideways type of range for plenty of weeks right now.
NEUT38|So if you're looking to invest in Amazon or trade in Amazon and Buy Amazon.
NEUT39|I think this this.
NEUT40|Price level support price double or this range could be a potential buying level for you here.
NEUT41|And this range is for sellers.
NEUT42|If you're looking to sell Amazon.
NEUT43|We will get a clear indication once we.
NEUT44|Take out these levels.
NEUT45|Once these levels are broken, then we can say the trend of Amazon.
BEAR46|For now it is completely in a sideways trend.
NEUT47|And I think for intraday as it is breaking up.
BULL48|It could be a potential shot today for intraday trades.
NEUT49|But that's my update on Amazon.
