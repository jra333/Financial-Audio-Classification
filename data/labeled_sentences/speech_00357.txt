NEUT0|"""Well, you know I I started off in 93 so I experienced seven years of a bull market that morphed into Amenia and the market is not any were close."
NEUT1|I think stocks PE's are still really cheap against both risk equity risk premium, meaning what you're paying for risk.
BULL2|And they're super cheap against bonds.
NEUT3|I think there's a feeling that because stocks move so much since March, there topping, but we have to keep in mind.
NEUT4|I mean, we went through.
BULL5|The biggest stress test for stocks in five lifetimes, and they survived.
BULL6|I think that really argues, PE's are going to expand pre dramatically next couple of years.
NEUT7|I guess my real question or issue is irememberthe.com boom.
NEUT8|I remember what happened.
NEUT9|Kind of going up into the mortgage crisis.
NEUT10|I remember the recoveries from both of them.
NEUT11|None of them are like a pandemic where a market is again at record highs.
NEUT12|How exactly then do investors navigate this knowing full well that we're not even through the worst of COVID-19?
BULL13|But put markets at record highs.
NEUT14|Yeah, well, you know.
BULL15|I think the reason markets managed to get to here, which is record highs, is because 76% of the S&P is a growth index, which means it's not not really that economically sensitive, and in fact they benefited from stay at home.
BULL16|Because these are category killer dictionary, home stocks like Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Google and their peas expanded.
NEUT17|But it's not.
NEUT18|Like this, things that got hit by the economy actually did.
NEUT19|Well that epicenter trade, which is 25% of the S&P, is flat on its back.
BEAR20|It underperformed growth by 70% this year.
NEUT21|7000 basis points, so I think.
NEUT22|You know just those things going back to their old highs is 200 points in the SP.
NEUT23|Thomas Kelly here.
NEUT24|One of the things supporting that 7% calls you outline is that you say talk about how the COVID-19 3rd wave could be slowing without delving into the science there right now.
NEUT25|What happens if it re accelerates?
NEUT26|Is this call off the table?
BEAR27|Uh, it would hurt, you know.
BEAR28|I mean, wave 3 is really huge wave across the country, 'cause I mean every state is being engulfed by covid.
NEUT29|So I don't think people should think that they aren't witnessing it in their own backyard.
NEUT30|But the worst hit areas are six states that we use an acronym called Wind Suit and Wisconsin, Illinois, and they also Texas look like they're rolling over so that maybe the part good news.
NEUT31|Of course, the bad news is that it doesn't mean cases can't erupt in the East Coast, right?
NEUT32|New York and Massachusetts.
BEAR33|Connecticut have been kind of largely spared in this way, but if it gets bad, then their wave three is going to grow.
NEUT34|So I yeah, we're somewhat optimistic that there's some signs it's rolling over in the States that got really hit early in Wave 3, but it doesn't mean it's over.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
