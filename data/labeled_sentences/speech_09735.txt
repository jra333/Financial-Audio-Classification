NEUT0|"""Coming up on 8:25 this Wednesday morning, it was one year ago this week when the market crash Pete, the Planner is here to talk about what's happened since that dreadful week."
BULL1|Pete good morning to you.
NEUT2|Good morning.
BEAR3|It is been a long year.
NEUT4|I have to say Daniel at the beginning of this thing one year ago today I looked much different.
NEUT5|I was as handsome as Jimmy O'Brien and this is what I look like now.
BEAR6|So it's been a long year.
NEUT7|We had a little more hair.
NEUT8|I would probably be better predict that.
NEUT9|How has the market changed since then?
NEUT10|Alright, so last year at this time we were doing daily, you know, discussions on the air about what was happening and it was a disaster.
BULL11|But Daniel, it is the ultimate lesson and investing while the economy has continued to struggle, we've had some rebound.
BULL12|We're still trying to find our footing.
NEUT13|The market took off really from March 23rd, right from March 23rd on the market was on fire, the S&P 500.
BULL14|Which is the most common index that people used to talk about the market was up 66% from we're at one year ago today to today.
NEUT15|That's what it is.
NEUT16|Well, how about this one?
BULL17|The NASDAQ, which is more tech driven investing is up 95% in the last 365 days.
NEUT18|And of course the technology we're using to talk to each other today.
BULL19|Something like a zoom went up 210% unbelievable.
NEUT20|Yeah, so Daniel.
NEUT21|The lesson here is.
NEUT22|When the market is crashing or correcting or going into a bear market, if people keep their head, take a breath and don't sell, they generally do OK. That makes a lot of sense and very quickly you think that will happen again in 2021.
NEUT23|Do I think there will be another level of returns?
NEUT24|Another crash, oh, another crash.
NEUT25|No, not necessarily.
BULL26|I do think the consumer economy is going to have a robust return here in 2021.
NEUT27|I think 2022 later early 2023.
NEUT28|Could be interesting as as we find our equilibrium of spending as consumers.
NEUT29|But I think people can relax from a market standpoint this year and just enjoy the returns they got from last year.
BULL30|OK Pete, the planner always good to talk with you this morning.
BULL31|Happy Saint Patrick's Day to you Sir.
BULL32|"You too Daniel."""
