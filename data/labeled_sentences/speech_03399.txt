NEUT0|"""His claim this will be a video chart on ticker symbol FUBO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, another big day on this one and certainly updates need to be done.
NEUT5|So first thing to do is actually just delete this line out down here.
NEUT6|Sure, it still pertains to the charge is not relevant right now.
NEUT7|And from the presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines every look, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible.
NEUT8|The 1st update that need to be made come about based on a foundation of ruling charting which dates when levels of.
NEUT9|Resistance are broken and closed above you want to see them act as supports on the newest areas of support.
NEUT10|Down here at 44.
NEUT11|But I'm going to do is actually a justice level of support.
NEUT12|Now up to the 4750 Mark and call that the newest ideal level of support.
NEUT13|Ideal meaning for task like you won't make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
BULL14|That would be if the price could say up above the 4750 mark.
BEAR15|Now with that being said, don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that level, that does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT16|But you have to price could stay above that area.
BULL17|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of power.
NEUT18|Moving forward, taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT19|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT20|The 50.
NEUT21|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT22|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT23|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT24|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT25|Yes and about 48 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT26|As long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
BULL27|The first level is very well established now that $55 Mark showed up in a big way.
NEUT28|Yeah, the price.
NEUT29|Did you know, poke it set up above their ones, but after the price fell back below, it could never get up above 55 again.
NEUT30|So keep a close eye on that.
BULL31|If 55 can be broken at next key level would be up there at 5750, so keep running these types of levels moving forward, but All in all a very solid day.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT33|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT38|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT44|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT45|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
