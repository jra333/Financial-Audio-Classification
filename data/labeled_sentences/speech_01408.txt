NEUT0|"""We've looked at the S&P 500."
NEUT1|We've looked at the earnings per share.
NEUT2|Now it's time to examine the relationship between the two.
NEUT3|Let's take.
NEUT4|S&P 500, let's call it the numerator, the top half of the fraction, let's call.
NEUT5|The earnings.
NEUT6|Per share.
NEUT7|Bottom half or denominator fraction divide the two.
NEUT8|And you get the price earnings ratio.
NEUT9|Divide.
NEUT10|Denominator into the numerator.
NEUT11|You get the price earnings ratio.
NEUT12|Price.
NEUT13|Value of the S&P 500 divided by earnings or earnings per share.
NEUT14|Notice.
NEUT15|That four, oh 45 years from 1945 to about 1990.
NEUT16|The ratio was not constant.
NEUT17|But it fluctuated within a range.
NEUT18|Sometimes a little above 20, sometimes a little below 10.
NEUT19|Using an eyeball estimate, let's call it 15.
NEUT20|But we've gotten a value of about 15.
NEUT21|To the nearest 5.
NEUT22|For the price earnings ratio and then all of a sudden.
NEUT23|In the 1990s, look how it surges.
NEUT24|From around 15.
NEUT25|Up to over 30, the price earning ratio.
NEUT26|Doubles from 15 to 30.
NEUT27|In other words, this tells you speculation was rampant.
BULL28|That investors were bidding up the value of the S&P 500 far more rapidly.
NEUT29|Then the earnings of the stocks represented in the S&P 500.
NEUT30|And as the price earnings ratio, rows and rows and rows.
NEUT31|One has to ask.
NEUT32|Well, what was underlying this behavior?
NEUT33|Why did investors think that earnings would continue to grow indefinitely?
NEUT34|And therefore why were they willing to bid the prices?
BULL35|Of those stocks upward in anticipation of the rising earnings.
NEUT36|The answer to that question, of course.
NEUT37|Is the new economy.
NEUT38|The new economy was an economy.
NEUT39|In which.
NEUT40|Efficiency or productivity?
BULL41|Rose so rapidly and was rising so rapidly and would rise so rapidly.
BULL42|That ever higher profits were on the horizon.
NEUT43|The reason for this, of course.
NEUT44|Was the technological revolution associated with the personal computer?
NEUT45|The web.
NEUT46|The Internet graphics, new ways of disseminating.
NEUT47|And sharing information.
BULL48|All these were to cut costs and by cutting costs, improve earnings.
NEUT49|As far as the eye could see, and therefore justified the ever rising price earnings ratios or the value of those stocks.
NEUT50|Unfortunately, as we can see.
BULL51|Eventually, the price earnings ratio rose to a peak.
NEUT52|And then fell away.
BEAR53|We know that the Standard and Poor's 500 crashed in the year 2000.
NEUT54|Our next set of questions, of course.
NEUT55|To be dealt with in the next module is what happened.
NEUT56|Why did those?
NEUT57|Investors.
BEAR58|Become so disappointed with those earnings.
BEAR59|"And why did the earnings eventually crash?"""
