NEUT0|"""This weekend, legendary call was made that still resonates today, squawk on the street anchor Mark Haynes called the bottom of the stock market."
NEUT1|What we refer to here is the Haynes bottom.
NEUT2|Take a listen.
NEUT3|However, I'm going to step out on a limb here.
NEUT4|I think hold on everyone waiting.
NEUT5|Pick Berta bottom.
NEUT6|I really do.
NEUT7|Exchange actually went for a lot longer than that.
NEUT8|He talked about his methodology looking at percentage of SMP percentages, and then it was pre open.
BULL9|As I recall, Aaron said well we might get a bounce today, at least I'll give you credit even for that.
NEUT10|And Mark essentially said, I think this one has actual legs.
NEUT11|Yeah, I mean I used to go back and forth with Mark on email and he would just send me an email.
NEUT12|Says 9191 down the up volume was when he said listen, that's the question we used to call it the crescendo together and he was always I say.
NEUT13|He would say to be Jim.
NEUT14|Is it a crescendo?
NEUT15|And I would say I think it's crescendo and he would come back and say no, it's not a crescendo it because what he did was he timed.
NEUT16|He didn't make a million calls.
NEUT17|That's what was so effective.
NEUT18|Like when he said go out on a limb.
NEUT19|Mark did not give you a single call during the decline of that there was trouble.
NEUT20|So when he did that it was a combination of all these indices and fear.
NEUT21|And he made the calls really gutsy.
NEUT22|Call no reason to make it.
NEUT23|That's what matters.
NEUT24|He had no reason to make and he wasn't off by a week or a month.
NEUT25|Movies are made pretty much right on.
NEUT26|I came on later that day and I said, look, you know when Mark makes a call he makes some very rarely.
NEUT27|So just a bit cover your short by because that's how meaningful he, you know we've looked at so long.
NEUT28|There's a lot of viewers who didn't know him now, sadly.
NEUT29|But when he made a call, it was so not idle.
NEUT30|Yeah, like it here.
NEUT31|"No, he never did that."""
