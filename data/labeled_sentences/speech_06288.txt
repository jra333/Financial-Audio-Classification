BEAR0|"""Markets on Wall Street and around the globe are seeing dramatic swings as traders weigh uncertainty."
NEUT1|Coming from the Chinese economy.
NEUT2|But for you, the individual investor here are five key pieces of advice to help you keep a much clearer focus on what's going on on Wall Street.
NEUT3|Number one.
NEUT4|Don't panic.
NEUT5|Stocks still aren't cheap, but they aren't extremely overpriced either.
NEUT6|In fact, U.S. stocks are trading at an average of their long term inflation adjusted earnings.
BULL7|That puts them nearly in line with a mix of bull and bear markets over the past three decades.
NEUT8|#2 don't fixate on the news there.
NEUT9|It is.
BEAR10|The markets have closed on this day that was bad.
BEAR11|We are down 620 points.
NEUT12|Asian diseases take a look at these absolute drubbing going on remember, sudden market drops are normal.
BEAR13|Mistaking them for something more dramatic can cause you to lose sight of your long term investing goals.
NEUT14|With market data available right in the palm of our hands.
NEUT15|All day, it's easy to be consumed by the Blizzard of numbers and opinions associated with dramatic stock turns.
NEUT16|The more often you update yourself on the markets and moves, the more volatile and risky it will appear to you.
BEAR17|This can cloud your judgment and cause unnecessary knee jerk reactions.
NEUT18|#3, don't fixate on the word correction.
BEAR19|A market correction is often defined as a 10% drop, but historically people have used the term correction.
NEUT20|To mean drops of anywhere between 5% and 25% or So what really matters is the markets outlook for the future, not how far the market drops in the here and now.
NEUT21|#4 don't overreact, but don't be complacent either.
BULL22|Can your portfolio withstand a protracted market decline?
BULL23|This is a good time to revisit your portfolio to be sure you're well diversified with plenty of cash, some bonds, and a mix of global stocks, the bear market of 2007 to 2009 is a good barometer.
BULL24|If you got through that epic decline without selling, you'll probably be able to withstand the potential further declines this year and #5.
NEUT25|If you're not sure where the market goes from here, you're not alone.
NEUT26|It would be nice if someone anyone knew what the stock market was going to do next, but no one does.
BULL27|Having the humility to know that you don't know, and to recognize that no one else does either is a huge advantage for long term investors.
NEUT28|It's not how markets behave, but how you behave in response to them.
NEUT29|"That ultimately will determine your success."""
