NEUT0|"""The price to earnings ratio is a basic measure."
NEUT1|It doesn't do much more than measure basically, But let's talk about what the price to earnings ratio or PE ratio is.
NEUT2|Briefly, if you take a company's earnings per share, let's just say a stock, a company earned $1.00 per share in earnings last year, and if its stock is trading at $25 a share, then you take the price to earnings ratio 25.
NEUT3|/ 1 is 25.
NEUT4|You'd say that PE on that stock is 25.
NEUT5|Now let's just take two companies.
NEUT6|Now.
NEUT7|One has a dollar earnings per share and the other has a dollar earnings per share.
NEUT8|Over the past year, one stock is trading in 25, the other is trading at 15.
NEUT9|The PE of this company 25 is higher than this one, but they have the same earnings, so why would this company that's earning a dollar per share traded 25 and this one earned a dollar per share is only trading at 15.
NEUT10|Well, we start to get into the subtleties and the questions about why are PE ratios, what they are and without going on too long in my happy Flostre video, this is not a long course on P ratio.
NEUT11|I'll simply say that often the PE ratio expresses the markets expectations of a company.
NEUT12|High PE ratio means.
BULL13|High expectations for that stock lot of people are expecting it to grow, grow well and not make mistakes.
NEUT14|It's priced more for perfection.
NEUT15|On the other hand, of stock with lower price earnings ratio is one that the market doesn't expect as much of if it stubs its toe, that might be OK, but often it's not as good a company.
NEUT16|That's why it's trading at a lower PE ratio.
NEUT17|So as an investor, would you rather invest in a stock that has a high PE that has those higher expectations?
NEUT18|Or would you rather invest in a stock that has a lower PE with lower expectations?
NEUT19|As an investor, I prefer higher PE ratio companies and that definitely flies in the face of how most people look at the stock market and guilty as charged.
NEUT20|I'm certainly not saying I'm right.
NEUT21|There are some wonderful investors who specifically look for low price earnings ratios all the time, and in fact most of us are taught to look for low PE ratios.
NEUT22|On the other hand, I like to find excellence and most of the greatest companies in America.
NEUT23|Whether there Walmart throughout the 1970s and 80s, Starbucks in the 1990s.
NEUT24|You name those great companies Apple today.
BULL25|These are companies that traded consistently at high price earnings ratios all the way through as they doubled and tripled and tripled again.
NEUT26|"So I prefer to find excellence, which means most of the time I have to pay up for higher PE ratios for my kind of my style investment."""
