BEAR0|"""And I think that there's a complacency."
BEAR1|Remember, we ever since the Super Bowl where we should have had what I regard as his severe decline.
BEAR2|After it was we realized that the Chinese have lost control things.
BEAR3|I expected the market to go down.
BEAR4|I've been very, very negative.
NEUT5|Much more negative in a long time.
BEAR6|And yet we got such froth.
BEAR7|And we had so many stocks going up where their numbers weren't going to be that good.
NEUT8|So I mean that yes, there are absolutely some situations that I'm going to like will.
NEUT9|But wow, I mean, come on.
NEUT10|I mean, last week was just this.
NEUT11|Horrible week when it came to the junk that was going up and I just said, well, maybe we actually need a washout and then we spread to Italy before we wake up tomorrow and there's another one.
NEUT12|Another cluster on the continent.
NEUT13|Do you think we can go up?
BEAR14|I think it's going to be hard gym and clearly the sentiment towards the clothes was negative.
BEAR15|We lost another 250 points at having got to only 800 down.
NEUT16|Do you think as well we'll play catch up when Asian markets European markets open tomorrow?
NEUT17|Yeah look, I think the Chinese market is totally phony.
NEUT18|I mean they're not letting anyone sell.
NEUT19|You have to notify the government.
NEUT20|They do have a trillion dollars they could repatriate if they're really in a jam.
NEUT21|But I, I think, look, if I were an enterprising Reporter right now, I would go to wear to JFK terminal.
NEUT22|'cause there's a beautiful series of planes that come in from United Arab Emirates.
NEUT23|From Milan to JFK.
NEUT24|And I want to know are those people being stopped?
NEUT25|I mean, I know there's been some from China, but if you can get you went up to Fashion Week, you got sick, you got on plane.
NEUT26|Well, what's the difference between Italy now and China?
NEUT27|Yeah, just the number of cases Jim so, So what do investors do?
NEUT28|I mean, we often look to history an look to SARS, another sort of pandemics.
BEAR29|And you know, it's always proven to be something short lived that you know is awful.
BULL30|And of course there's a human toll, but investors were rewarded for staying in the market.
NEUT31|Is that your advice to just sort of go back?
NEUT32|And actually, what happened in the past?
BULL33|No, stay in we're getting a very good.
BEAR34|You know we're getting a comprehensive decline.
NEUT35|I think you can start buying the staples tomorrow.
NEUT36|I think the drug stocks work, you just don't want to be in the crosshairs of what I regard as being anything it's made in China or anything traveled hotels.
NEUT37|Very bit airlines very, very big cruise ships.
BEAR38|I mean, I can't believe people still buying those stocks anything oil is so wrong, oils going down.
BEAR39|This is just a big slow down the industrials ran last week.
NEUT40|I mean, how could?
NEUT41|How could Illinois Torx bits like all time high last week?
NEUT42|I mean, we really are what kind of nuts and what was being bought.
NEUT43|So now we're going to come down.
NEUT44|And people have to start thinking about their time horizon member that you don't make much money in bonds.
BULL45|You're going to get the opportunities that you haven't had, that you should have gotten.
NEUT46|But if you don't have any cash, I don't know what you're going to do.
NEUT47|I think it's still not too late to sell.
NEUT48|If you have any cash.
NEUT49|These are very different situation.
NEUT50|Tell us what's with the most cash in the world?
NEUT51|Jim, tell us what's coming up on the show tonight.
NEUT52|Well, we've got a couple guys that are really interesting.
NEUT53|Blocks first **** scene forever.
NEUT54|They Rang the closing Bell.
NEUT55|Case of a contact center situation.
BULL56|High growth tech.
NEUT57|No coronavirus whatsoever.
NEUT58|Do you make your stand in it?
NEUT59|I don't know.
NEUT60|I think that in the end it's not exactly the kind of thing that Warren Buffett would buy.
NEUT61|I do like the HP, HP Q numbers after the close.
BULL62|That was a very good quarter.
NEUT63|That one may be too cheap to ignore.
BULL64|And shares are up 3% aftermarket Jim thank you.
BULL65|I mean they beat consensus by a gigantic come out.
NEUT66|It's very inexpensive than buying back at the company.
NEUT67|"What's not to like?"""
