NEUT0|"""Ethereum making a new all time high in this session today, pushing well above the $1600 level, let's bring adjourned licari for the very latest on what's driving that move Jerrod?"
NEUT1|Yeah, there could be some excitement ahead of next week.
NEUT2|See me at theory.
NEUT3|Yeah, excuse me.
BULL4|Ether futures at Ethereum is the network, so we want to get that right here, but you can see it ether is up a 9 1/2% on the day, 17% over the last five days, and just take a look at what it's done this year.
BULL5|Crypto really having a nice start to the year you can see it was kind of trading sideways after hitting some record highs earlier a few weeks ago and now it is off to the races.
BULL6|Once again.
NEUT7|Bitcoin not doing that badly either here and we can see if it's 25% year to date it did have that downturn but it is now broken up or broken up through that and is continuing to the upside and just a note on some of these ether futures that are coming.
NEUT8|They are cash settled so this is on the CME where you also have Bitcoin futures one.
NEUT9|Interesting aspect of these futures is that they can have margin offset.
BULL10|So if you have Bitcoin and ether in the same basket in the same account, maybe 1 long, 1 short, those margins can offset.
BULL11|So just kind of illustrates the institutional rise that we've seen in crypto currencies.
NEUT12|So add that to your list.
NEUT13|Also, I'm going to be watching PayPal after the Bell because those earnings are going to provide some insights just as to its crypto ambitions, especially with Bitcoin using it as a payment mechanism so.
NEUT14|Definitely going to be tracking that into the clothes, and I also want to hit the energy market.
BULL15|This has been a leader as of late and we could see Exxon up over 3% there.
BULL16|Chevron up over 2% and this comes after the J Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee of the OPEC Plus met today and no formal recommendations.
BULL17|But it looked like OPEC plus released a statement that they were going to continue aggressively trying to contain the oil market and we can see today in commodities that we're having another.
BULL18|Big update crude oil in the upper left is up about two percent, 2.23% up 17% year to date.
NEUT19|And guess what?
NEUT20|You'd have to go back to.
BULL21|I believe January of last year to see these prices.
NEUT22|And in fact, that is where we are right here.
NEUT23|Just kind of treading water over the two year.
BULL24|But really an impressive recovery from those negative prices that we had last April.
NEUT25|Akiko and Zach?
BULL26|"OK, thanks so much for that Jerry."""
