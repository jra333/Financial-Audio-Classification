NEUT0|"""Let's dive deeper into the action."
NEUT1|With our markets reporters looking at equities, bonds, currencies and commodities.
NEUT2|Abigail, what are you watching?
NEUT3|So let's take a look at the S&P 500 on a day.
NEUT4|That's probably its first legitimate day of really trying to take on those July record highs.
BEAR5|And the first shot happened earlier today, right around 11:25, the S&P 500 crossing above its last record high right around 3026, almost coming above its all time high, but coming just slightly short of that and then slightly lower, slightly lower, slightly lower, not hitting it on the clothes, missing it by about.
BULL6|Three points for the record closed five points with all time high.
NEUT7|Putting this into the context of a chart that we've been looking at, most of the indexes gains this year came in the first four to five months.
BEAR8|In this range, the uncertainty around trade and whipsaws, but during this time the 200 day moving average creeping higher that tells you long term buyers or bullish below the RSI momentum indicator starting to creep out of a coiling range.
NEUT9|All of this suggests it's very likely Taylor that we could just see the S&P 500 put in new all time highs record closing highs, perhaps next week, or at least in the coming weeks.
NEUT10|Taylor.
BULL11|Well, obviously talk about a 4/10 of 1% gain and the potential record for the SNP, and it is all about the chip makers for me today because they are rising 2%.
BULL12|Closing in again on that record high here that we are getting and you have a lot of winners deep down within the chip makers.
NEUT13|Companies like Intel for example that are really leading the gains day and really highlighting the fact that these chipmakers have weathered the trade fight pretty well and I want to come and take a look at a chart here them showing inside my terminal because so often we talk about the socks and the chip makers relative to the SMP.
NEUT14|I wanted to deep dive in.
BULL15|Just look at the tech in particular because this quarter alone you have the Sox index, which is up about 5.8% and it's beating the broader tech market.
BULL16|For example the NASDAQ, which is only up about 3% or so.
BULL17|So again within tech socks and the chip makers continue to be the star performers for Anita.
BULL18|Thank you so much Taylor.
BULL19|I'm taking a look at gold which is at about a 1% weekly gain on week U.S. data that underscores the threats of slowing global growth.
BULL20|And it also reinforces the case for the Federal Reserve to cut rates next week at the feds FOMC meeting.
NEUT21|Now this is the Fed expected to cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point.
BULL22|And as we know, lower borrowing costs increase the appeal of non interest bearing assets like gold.
BULL23|So it's no surprise that gold has gained about 18% this year.
BULL24|As many central banks have adopted looser monetary policy hoping to boost their economies that have been hurt by trade wars and also as geopolitical uncertainty, has supported haven demand.
BEAR25|"Now, Perth Mint CEO Richard Hayes said on Bloomberg TV earlier today concerns over a U.S. presidential impeachment and a trade war with China could mean even more gains for gold."""
