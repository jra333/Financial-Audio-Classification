NEUT0|"""In recent years, three companies have amassed so many assets in the public markets that they've come to eclipse all other investors."
NEUT1|In terms of size and market power.
NEUT2|So here's the deal.
BEAR3|People are really bad at picking which stocks are going to succeed and which stocks are going to fail.
NEUT4|You may have heard the example they blindfolded monkey throwing darts at a stock list does better than a professional well in a lot of cases that's actually true.
NEUT5|So a man named Jack Bogle invented something called the Index Fund and Index Fund.
NEUT6|Basically, instead of choosing which stocks you think are going to succeed and which are going to fail, you just take a basket.
NEUT7|Of stocks and you track it so the S&P 500, for example, is a basket of stocks.
NEUT8|It's the 500 largest companies in the US, and it's weighted by their size.
NEUT9|So this is often referred to as passive investing because you're not sitting around researching which companies are going to do well this year, which ones are going to poorly.
NEUT10|You're not trading in and out of those, you're just putting your money in an index fund and letting it do its thing.
NEUT11|Now let's switch to something else.
NEUT12|Perhaps you've heard of a monopoly, or perhaps you've also heard of an oligopoly.
NEUT13|Oligopoly is essentially the same thing as in a monopoly.
NEUT14|In a monopoly, there is one company providing.
NEUT15|Goods and services are in a particular market.
NEUT16|In an oligopoly, there's just a small handful of companies providing all the goods or services in a single market.
NEUT17|So one example of this is phone services in the US, which you're basically limited to AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, or Sprint.
NEUT18|If you want phone services in the United States.
NEUT19|So that is an oligopoly.
NEUT20|Well in the world of index investing we have emerging to be a bit of an oligopoly as well.
NEUT21|The three companies that comprise it are Vanguard, that one that was started by Jack Bolo.
NEUT22|By the way, that's the largest provider of mutual funds in the world.
NEUT23|You also have Black Rock and you also have State Street.
NEUT24|Now this chart, which is produced from research by Bacchus, Sinkinson, and Conlin, shows the ownership of an average company.
BEAR25|I'm sorry the average ownership of a typical company by these three firms.
NEUT26|So I put the percent here to remind you that Vanguard, if you can see it in 2017, was approaching average ownership of nine percent of a typical company.
BEAR27|Now 9% may seem on its face like a small number.
NEUT28|But think about this.
NEUT29|If you combined these three companies, they would be the single largest shareholder.
BULL30|Of nine out of every ten public companies, that is just massive power and you can see it's been increasing in the last two decades.
NEUT31|So shortly before his death, Jack Bogle, the inventor of index funds.
BULL32|"He even admitted that there is a bit of concern if these three firms continue this path of market dominance."""
