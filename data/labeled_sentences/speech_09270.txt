NEUT1|Extraordinary gang welcome to the channel.
NEUT2|Got a quick video for y'all about Bionano Genomics.
NEUT3|This is not financial advice, I'm just showing you my financial decisions.
NEUT4|I currently have 1158 shares of Bionano Genomics and I'm very excited for the earnings call tomorrow.
BULL5|I do not expect the earnings per share to be that good.
BULL6|However, I expect the revenue to be very good.
BEAR7|They currently have a revenue estimate of $3.5 million and the past two quarters they have surprised the revenue amount and have exceeded that revenue amount.
BULL8|I believe that trend will continue tomorrow.
BULL9|Also, looking at the analyst price target, the average price target is $10 in the highest $15 which we already hit back in February and really think that we're going to hit back to those levels and I'm very excited for this earnings call tomorrow.
BULL10|I think that it will put a lot of faith into this stock, typically around earnings.
BEAR11|The stock will increase the day before or the day of, and it will have a slight drop the day after leading.
NEUT12|Through that Friday, but the following weeks afterwards, after that earnings call, it's typically very bullish up until the next earnings call.
NEUT13|So I'm definitely going to be careful tomorrow.
NEUT14|I may have a little swing trade, and I may sell some my shares tomorrow and buy back in by the dip around Friday if the stock ever goes down.
NEUT15|So I definitely have my trailing stop losses on.
NEUT16|However, I do believe in this company long term whether I sell or not.
NEUT17|I truly believe in this company and I have a link to a previous video I made about this stock earlier this month.
BULL18|But taking a look at the earnings per share from previous quarters, I clearly see an uptrend here, and I think that is going to follow that uptrend tomorrow and a lot of good news came out a lot of good studies came out about the company's products and the offering came out.
NEUT19|So a lot of institutions bought in because they truly believe in this company.
BEAR20|So I think that will definitely see an uptrend and I'm not sure if the earnings per share will actually be positive this quarter.
NEUT21|But I think it will be pretty close.
BULL22|However, I think if this company keeps on the same track they will have a positive earnings per share for quarter one 2021.
BULL23|Anyways, for tomorrow they currently have an earnings estimate of negative $0.05, which is 6 times better than it was this time last year.
BEAR24|Personally, I don't expect too much of a sell off after the earnings call, if any, just because the stock has already been beaten down so much.
BEAR25|It is down $6 from its high, so there's not too much to sell off.
NEUT26|Most of the investors that are still in this play or serious investors.
NEUT27|Me personally, I would love to keep this stock long term, however, if.
NEUT28|There is a big draft tomorrow.
BULL29|I'm definitely prepared with my stop loss.
NEUT30|Enjoy this video.
