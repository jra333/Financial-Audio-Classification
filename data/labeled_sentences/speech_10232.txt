BULL0|"""But it does kind of remind me of this call out of UBS where they take five are chewy and peloton to sell, and the line that stands out as we collectively see all three as emblematic of a market that values growth over any semblance of valuation that can be justified, right?"
NEUT1|That's that's some straight talk from UBS Evidence Lab, but it's UBS.
BEAR2|I thought it was when I heard that they had something negative to say about Chewy.
NEUT3|I said, well, that's just her see, everybody loves Chewy, and this is one of the most love stocks ever.
NEUT4|Peloton.
NEUT5|I thought that their acquisition Primc, or I'm not sure how good this was.
NEUT6|Illinois Tool Works, gave it up on a long time, but coral.
BEAR7|I thought that that resonated because these kinds of stocks that have just gone up because we think that the pandemic is never going to end.
BULL8|We're getting more vaccines and the Biden administration is were able to deliver on its 100,000,000.
NEUT9|Then you can't really own those stocks, they're just too high.
NEUT10|David, I do believe that, while Chewy is great and makes the process fun, I don't know.
NEUT11|So does Amazon, but they don't make the process fun, but they got great prices.
BULL12|Great prices yeah.
NEUT13|Amazon, yeah, where do you get your dog food?
NEUT14|I don't know where we get it.
NEUT15|We gotta get special.
NEUT16|We how much is it?
NEUT17|How much is it?
NEUT18|Is a carton of milk.
NEUT19|I know that we've already gone through this.
NEUT20|It depends where you get it.
NEUT21|Depends if it doesn't have the hormones or not.
NEUT22|George HW.
NEUT23|Yeah.
NEUT24|I mean it can be 450 or 5 bucks as much as that.
NEUT25|If you go with the horizon with that or you know it could, it could be different.
NEUT26|If you want all the antibiotics and hormones in there.
NEUT27|So it really depends.
BEAR28|I think Amazon this is screaming by because I think that many people have sampled it and are staying with it.
NEUT29|By the way, a lot of notes last week or about Netflix.
NEUT30|What am I leading up to?
NEUT31|There's a good piece today about Facebook.
BULL32|There's a piece about Apple having a good quarter.
NEUT33|Is this the return of Fang?
NEUT34|Or we're supposed to continue to just buy endless industrials like eem like Emerson David?
NEUT35|Because Emerson wow David Farr's about to leave, so maybe something big is going to happen.
NEUT36|In other words, self-help industrials?
NEUT37|David, that's what I'm hearing about.
NEUT38|It's funny we haven't talked Emerson in awhile, so now do you saw was in there and yeah, they sort of figured all that stuff out.
BULL39|Oil and gas did well.
BULL40|Oil and gas has been doing well.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
