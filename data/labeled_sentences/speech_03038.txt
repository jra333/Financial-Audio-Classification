BEAR0|"""Investors responding as you might think to all of that bluster, a down day across the board on Wall Street, the Dow finishing down 218 points, closing at 24,189."
BEAR1|The SMP was down 14 points, ending at 2642, and the NASDAQ down as well.
NEUT2|25 points, finishing at 7069 market analysis.
NEUT3|Now from Megan Higgins.
NEUT4|She is from adviser investments in Newton, MA.
NEUT5|She is in The Newsroom.
NEUT6|Hi, Megan.
NEUT7|Hi Brian, so is it this political turmoil?
BEAR8|The back and forth between Russia and the US is that what drove the markets down today?
BEAR9|You could definitely say that Brian, it dragged across all global indexes today and simply the fact that Russia has been dealing with enough lately in this additional tweet from Trump did not help today.
BEAR10|Trends in other international conflicts, for example, could lead to higher costs for corporations and even slow down economic growth.
BULL11|Mounting geopolitical tensions are certainly alarming here at home, investors were able to digest fed minutes and then indicated that the Fed is looking at a faster pace of tightening in the likelihood of two to three more interest rate hikes this year.
NEUT12|All right, let's talk about Mark Zuckerberg.
NEUT13|2 days of testimony first before the Senate and then before the House committees on this.
NEUT14|How did that impact the markets?
BULL15|Well, it did in a big way as far as Luckily for Facebook, it traded modestly throughout the day and they ended up around 7:10 silver percent.
NEUT16|And Zuckerberg testimony it really regarding the privacy and security concerns that Dusty was speaking about.
NEUT17|It really didn't seem to rattle investors.
NEUT18|It traded in a narrow trading range.
BULL19|However, I think it did add kind of just more respect for Zuckerberg in a way where he was able to fend off very difficult questions regarding censorship and alleged bias.
NEUT20|And in a way, it was kind of like a ping pong match.
NEUT21|Some would argue that Congress doesn't know much about how Facebook works, and some would argue that Zuckerberg doesn't know much about privacy regulation.
BULL22|After all the sudden done, lawmakers do seem to be prepared to enforce regulation, and I think at the end of the day it seemed like Zuckerberg did agree with that to some degree.
BEAR23|Now leading up to all of this, we were all concerned about inflation.
NEUT24|We got some inflation news today.
NEUT25|What did it say?
BEAR26|Not too much change there with core inflation on it was around 110% for the day for the month of March, and that's like drops likely to be transitory due to a drop in the decline of gas prices last month.
BULL27|And looking at the big picture view for annual inflation, an increase by over 2.4% for the year.
BULL28|And inflation is likely to continue with the rise continue to rise with the labor market tightening.
BULL29|And of course with increased government spending to continue.
NEUT30|Let's talk specifically about Bed Bath and Beyond reporting fourth quarter earnings after the Bell.
NEUT31|How they do?
BEAR32|Oh, they didn't do too good for the fourth quarter.
BEAR33|Their earnings actually fell their same.
BEAR34|Store sales fell by more than 14%, and that was definitely more than forecast.
NEUT35|And it's too bad.
NEUT36|Remember the day for consumers that used to be a weekend ritual where you stop at your local bed, bath and beyond.
NEUT37|Pick up some household essentials even with their legendary 20% coupon, it doesn't seem to be working for them anymore, and that's simply evidence that competitors such as Wayfair and Amazon are really taking over alright.
