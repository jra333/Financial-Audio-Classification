BEAR0|"""Well, I think if you if you look at the futures of in the futures must be rallying on the back of the fact that the president hasn't knowledge that there is a problem."
NEUT1|He's not out playing golf.
NEUT2|The complacency has disappeared.
BEAR3|There is a problem, so they're not rolling on the detail 'cause there is no detail and very little evidence that we've got so far is frankly a little bit concerning.
BEAR4|For me, payroll tax cut will fine, but that's not going to help deal with the economic downswing.
NEUT5|That's more about the bounce back stage, not what happens over the next 3-4 months.
NEUT6|What we really need to be seeing is more sophisticated, more targeted measures dealing with, for example, small business corporate cash flow.
BEAR7|If that's a big problem, tax Holidays or tax delays to corporates, having to pay tax.
NEUT8|That's what's needed, because that's where the real challenge comes when you get a sort of combined supply and demand shock coming together.
NEUT9|Is it important though that there is a shock and or type response?
NEUT10|Be 'cause communities respond to the psychological impact of a big message.
NEUT11|So I absolutely agree with you.
BULL12|Yes, keep those credit lines intact.
BEAR13|Squeeze the banks, force them to keep funding these smaller businesses.
NEUT14|But at some level you have to send a big message to the community that you, I think, a big message helps.
NEUT15|Yes, I mean we're dealing with fear.
NEUT16|I mean the virus, economically speaking, doesn't matter.
NEUT17|It's fear of the virus that matters.
NEUT18|That's what we're trying to balance.
NEUT19|But I think the challenge that we have here is from the US in particular.
NEUT20|Yeah, we had that rather inept rate cut and there was nothing else that wasn't the sort of economic leadership that we I think would have got from the Yellen fed or from the bankey fed.
BEAR21|And that that is a bit disappointing.
BEAR22|Now we're hearing payroll tax cut.
BEAR23|Well, this isn't 1950. the US labor market has changed.
NEUT24|You've now got a lot more self employment.
BEAR25|Payroll tax cut doesn't help if you're self employed.
NEUT26|Contract workers, gig workers.
NEUT27|Doesn't help, so I'm not saying don't do the payroll tax cut, but we need to see the detailed measures alongside the grandiose gestures.
