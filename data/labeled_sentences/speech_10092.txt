BULL4|Alcoa closed up 1.6% today at $9.41 around 1:10 Eastern Time.
BEAR5|That's when the headlines crossed that China is buying aluminum again, and we see that spike in the stock right there on the chart an as you can see, it did come slightly off those highs closing 1.6% up for the date.
BULL6|Alcoa CEO Klaus Kleinfeld telling Bloomberg News that he is quote very optimistic on aluminum sales, and he sees a recovery in China and in the US.
NEUT7|China clearly is out of the Woods.
BULL8|We clearly see that the Chinese economy has come back.
BULL9|It's actually growing again, and we absolutely see that China has actually become a net importer of metal.
NEUT10|They've roughly imported over the last, I would say, six months, roughly 700,000 tons.
BEAR11|So that's one place and we actually have seen signs of clearly the fall.
BEAR12|The fall stopped in the US and partially also also in Europe.
BULL13|Now, Kleinfeld also says that things are bottoming out an even coming back in some sectors, he mentions autos as one area of improvement, while the Dow Jones Aluminum Index gained 4.5%.
BULL14|After Kleinfeldt's comments on Bloomberg TV and so far this year, aluminum has gained 5% in London trading.
BEAR15|It did lag behind other metals such as copper and nickel as inventory.
BEAR16|Sawran production exceeded consumption.
BEAR17|Shares of Alcoa are down 16% this year, and just to remind you, Alcoa is out with quarterly earnings after the Bell tomorrow.
BEAR18|Analysts expect Alcoa to report a loss of 38.
BEAR19|Cents per share, and in fact we're expecting Alcoa to kick off a bleak earnings season.
