NEUT0|"""Playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame but not sure what I mean by 30 minutes that I do offer an explanation video at that link."
BEAR1|Well, a very rough day here for Apple Price Gap down and then had a very very impressive bonds to the upside and then the afternoon drama just shook the markets quite a bit and that didn't help.
NEUT2|The balance as everything just totally rolled back over.
NEUT3|But then it brings about a very critical level of support that all sorts of people are going to be watching moving forward.
NEUT4|And that's right down here at the one 2650 Mark, I mean just a quick recap of the past couple days.
NEUT5|You can see right there?
NEUT6|Generally speaking got around 1:26.
BULL7|Fifty did a good job balance.
NEUT8|Earlier today.
NEUT9|Held above that level balance and right now the price is sitting slightly above 126 fifty so you're going to have every brought everybody in there.
NEUT10|Brother's uncle watching that level and wondering can that area continue to hold?
NEUT11|Are the Bulls going to hold strong?
NEUT12|And while nothing is guaranteed by core point here is that it is a more than bound.
NEUT13|It is a more than rational thought to have that you know if the price does go sideways here and then continues on down.
BEAR14|That breaking up itself could very well create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
NEUT15|Again, I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but a break at 126.
NEUT16|Fifty could very realistically, you know.
NEUT17|Just create that much more bearishness in the stock, and if that level were to fail.
NEUT18|The next level of support after that would then be down there right around the one 2450 Mark.
NEUT19|As far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT20|As of right now, it's all about that Purple line right there.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|Moving average.
BEAR23|You can see this has been a massive thorn in the side of the chart couple of times.
NEUT24|There you can see right there and then this morning right there, so you know, I'm not saying that that level can't be broken, but if there is going to be any sort of bigger turn around, and yeah, Public Enemy number one by far is going to be about 50.
NEUT25|Moving average.
NEUT26|"So let's see how this one continues to play out."""
