NEUT8|Newer company to the public markets.
NEUT9|I think there's always going to be a little bit of a tendency for sure for the shorts to show up, but I'll remind everybody between myself and our founder Dan Gilbert and our leadership team.
NEUT10|We own 95% of rocket companies because we feel so strongly about our ability to grow.
BULL11|We've been growing for 35 years.
BULL12|We've shown consistent ability to grow and be profitable in any kind of market cycle.
