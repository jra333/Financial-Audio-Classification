BULL0|"""Yes, Sir, you are really know she would behave."
NEUT1|We bet with another one.
NEUT2|That's going to get right into it.
NEUT3|You know, we had to waste nobody time before we do that.
NEUT4|Let's get this video.
NEUT5|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they would be touching.
NEUT6|Bases on genius burnings.
NEUT7|That's ticker symbol GNUS.
NEUT8|We already talked about this stop multiple times on the channel, so we can go too much in detail.
NEUT9|We just want to be giving y'all some reassurance letting you know what to expect.
NEUT10|Short term and long term letting you know what support and resistance is.
NEUT11|So let's go ahead and check it out, y'all.
NEUT12|Right now at this time in this recording.
NEUT13|We train at about 273.
NEUT14|We opened it 285.
BEAR15|The high was 312, the lowest 261 to 52 hours 1173 fifty two equals $0.20.
BEAR16|So we down when we look we still up 3.33 point 7% today.
NEUT17|And if I went out, if I look at the chart we can see and I support right here, around $2.62, sixty one cents.
BULL18|We got a nice farmer support around 260 you guys.
BEAR19|So if we break the 260 we could follow straight down to 250 and tested 250 level an if we don't hold that 250 level we could follow straight down to around $232.30.
NEUT20|Worst case scenario but I want to.
NEUT21|You will want to add to your position at.
NEUT22|This thing falls down easy.
BULL23|Shaking out weak hands and weak investors, and this thing will most definitely turn back up to the upside.
BULL24|An I resistant points once we start back up on upside we got a nice resistance around $2.78 around 280.
BULL25|Soon as we bust through 280 this thing could fly straight back up to around 290 an retest this $3 hi this 3 to 11 that we hit this morning around 10:05 will retest that high and that's where I strongly resisted.
NEUT26|Point is right around $3.11.
NEUT27|Once we break that through living.
NEUT28|This thing could flag as we break that 311 and 313 range at three 11313 will fly straight off to around three 55360 and three 55360.
NEUT29|From there we can push straight up to 450 and once this thing is over $5, that's when the big boys are start getting in and this thing could easily go from 5 to $7.00.
NEUT30|Quit so right now there's still a buy zone for jeans brands.
NEUT31|I'll be loading incising into my position an.
NEUT32|Reader, I just angle.
NEUT33|That's all I got for this video.
NEUT34|If you like these type of updates, the type predictions, hot stocks, all that good stuff.
NEUT35|We post this type of stuff every single day.
NEUT36|Consider joining the family.
NEUT37|She would behaves and we out.
