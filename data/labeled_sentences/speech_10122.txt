NEUT0|"""Arrival let's take like the Apple stock we can see."
NEUT1|Here is a zero point 8% on the Friday closing on the market is returned.
NEUT2|Charge into daily chart.
NEUT3|We can see here we got a radical.
BULL4|But this radical has confirmed that we are back above the yummy supporting line here.
NEUT5|So actually here is a little bit J hook pattern pattern for the Apple Store on daily chart so it's a bullish sign for Apple.
BULL6|And also we can see from the weekly chart here we got a shooting star.
NEUT7|And then a hammer.
BULL8|So this means there's a lot of selling pressure upside, but there still buying power supporting it to go higher.
NEUT9|So here should be careful for any trader.
NEUT10|On the long position, because we just test the supporting level here we can see this story still have a fact.
NEUT11|At the low point of this, red candle just is about the top of this body.
BULL12|"So as long as we are above this level, then there's still hope for Apple to make a new high thank you."""
