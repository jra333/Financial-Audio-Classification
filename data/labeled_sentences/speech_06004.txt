BULL0|"""Hey folks, welcome to another foolish investing video from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I'm Rogers now.
NEUT2|Today I'm going to talk a bit about BP.
NEUT3|It's one of the most widely held stocks here in the UK.
BEAR4|It's also been a pretty miserable few years for BP shareholders.
NEUT5|No sooner had they gotten out of the financial crisis when disaster struck, and at the buckle in the Gulf of Mexico.
BEAR6|Real tough all time for the shells.
BEAR7|As a result of that, the gloom has held over the shares pretty much for the last four years, honestly.
NEUT8|And so today I really want to ask whether or not you should wait.
NEUT9|For the gloom to clear before investing in BP or whether you should sort of take the plunge and just go for it, I think the first point I'd like to make is that obviously the stock market hates uncertainty.
BULL10|It despises uncertainty at more than just about anything else, and so if you do wait for the things to look rosy for BP, there's a good chance that shares are going to be some way higher than they are today, so I think that's definitely something worth considering in this case, because.
NEUT11|For me, without the discount on the shares without the shares looking depressed, I'm not really interested in making an investment in BP.
NEUT12|Personally.
BULL13|Don't get me wrong, I think it's a very solid respectable gigantic business offering a pretty attractive 5% yield, and the company has done quite a lot to turn itself around since 2010.
NEUT14|I especially like the fact that it's shifting its strategy towards.
BULL15|Fewer projects, but potentially more lucrative projects.
NEUT16|I think that's important from a capital allocation standpoint.
BULL17|I think they're in better shape than they were in 2010.
NEUT18|Got more oil.
BULL19|So OK from that standpoint, but at the end of the day, BP does offer does compete in a really tough sector, and despite being a massive company, it's still very much at the mercy of the price of oil.
NEUT20|It's a very capital intensive business pulling a lot of oil out of the ground.
NEUT21|In deep ocean, water is very expensive.
NEUT22|Lot of fixed high fixed costs and so for me it's not the sort of opportunities that I would be looking to purchase at a fair price or a high price.
NEUT23|What makes it really interesting to me is the fact that it's relatively depressed.
NEUT24|I think it's cheap, and so to circle back to my first point, I think if you end up waiting for all the gloom to disappear and things to look rosy for BP, I think you end up paying a price.
NEUT25|Potentially that is less attractive and doesn't particularly interest me personally.
NEUT26|"So take a look, see what you think and full on."""
