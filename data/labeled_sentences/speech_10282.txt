NEUT0|"""In the meantime, Jim, these new guidelines, expanding eligibility to everyone 65 plus including those with conditions and not waiting for that second dose."
NEUT1|This is exactly what Gottlieb called for earlier in the week.
NEUT2|Yeah, Doctor Gottlieb got this dead right now what I want to know is how many if you get started with the system, which said the governors can do it.
NEUT3|And then you come up with these rules.
NEUT4|The governors, what are they going to do?
BEAR5|I mean, there's just a gigantic backlog.
NEUT6|Let's just use New York, for example.
NEUT7|No one really knows exactly where you are when you stand in New York, because they don't know you don't know whether they've done what workers they've done.
NEUT8|Are you 1B or whatever?
NEUT9|Or a lot of us who are registered in New Jersey?
NEUT10|We don't know.
BULL11|We got some thank you for that.
NEUT12|We registered so I don't know whether this supposed to supersede.
NEUT13|I'm sure it isn't.
NEUT14|But again, the government talks with forked tongue, I mean.
NEUT15|Who's supposed to play this game?
NEUT16|Is it the feds is at the state?
NEUT17|Is it CVS?
NEUT18|Is it Walgreens?
NEUT19|I don't know.
NEUT20|I mean, I think this is terrific because one thing is certain, we got a lot more vaccines than we have people who are taking the vaccine.
BULL21|Remember, we were able to vaccinate millions of people in three weeks in New York City in 1947 on smallpox.
BULL22|We obviously haven't been able to do that now, but I think best practices from states merged with the 65 is certainly going to make it so that maybe we have more of a federalist system.
NEUT23|I mean, I know I've I've reserved my 65.
NEUT24|I'm going to Florida.
NEUT25|Now go to Florida twice, even if it has to be quarantined because I want it.
NEUT26|And if 'cause I believe that these scientists are unbelievably good, wouldn't this be great if you can just go and get it, which is what we thought it would be, I think we're going to vaccine glut.
NEUT27|Doctor Gottlieb suggested that that's the case.
NEUT28|This fire amuses family.
NEUT29|I gotta congratulate Pfizer.
BULL30|I mean, what a great job.
NEUT31|I know no one's arguing there.
NEUT32|Jim and I know you've been talking on Twitter this morning about the prospects for J&J.
BULL33|Maybe we can discuss that after the brochure and how that might help things even further in February.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
