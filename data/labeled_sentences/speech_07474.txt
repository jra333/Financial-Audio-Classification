NEUT0|"""Michael Pearson is probably smarter than you are."
NEUT1|He is definitely smarter than I am.
NEUT2|He was a director at McKinsey of Very fancy consultancy and he graduated Coomb Laudy from Duke, a very fancy school.
NEUT3|Ditto bill access.
NEUT4|He runs a huge hedge fund and he was come Loudy at Harvard.
NEUT5|So how is it that Mr. Pearson was running Valiant and Mr Ackman was the biggest investor in it when it did this?
NEUT6|That is $80 billion flapping up to money heaven in just eight months.
NEUT7|$11 billion in value disappeared the day the company cut its targets again.
NEUT8|Surely smart people can prevent this or get out of the way.
BEAR9|There were warning signs.
NEUT10|Valion was a roll up.
BULL11|It grew by buying other companies at least $37 billion worth in the last eight years.
BEAR12|Rollups often crumble under the weight of their purchases.
NEUT13|Look at Tyco, which blew up 15 years ago after a string of acquisitions that would make Valiant jealous.
BULL14|Valeant reported its financial results after lots of non gap adjustments until recently.
NEUT15|For example, it reported something called adjusted cash flow, an oxymoron.
NEUT16|The whole point of cash is that you can't adjust it.
NEUT17|Group on another notorious adjuster acts as a helpful comparison in this context.
NEUT18|Valiant.
BULL19|Also seemed to find growth and profit where other companies could not.
NEUT20|Valeant's business model involved buying neglected products and companies squeezing costs out and making them grow faster.
NEUT21|But if this was possible, why didn't the old owners do it?
NEUT22|Where they so stupid?
NEUT23|One thinks of the revolutionary but mysterious business models of say?
NEUT24|Enron.
NEUT25|So that's not so tricky, is it?
NEUT26|Well, maybe.
NEUT27|Pfizer is a longtime serial acquirer, and it does OK all the big social media companies make large adjustments to reported earnings.
NEUT28|Apple Sustain profitability is quite unlike anything seen before in consumer electronics, but it's not a trick.
NEUT29|The problem is not seeing the red flags, it is determining which ones to ignore.
NEUT30|"Rob Armstrong Lex."""
