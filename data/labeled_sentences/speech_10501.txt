NEUT0|"""Jane Fraser, of course, the new CEO over it at City says hey, we're going to launch Zoom Free Fridays."
NEUT1|For our employees, free video calls at least internally, Jim.
BEAR2|Well, look, I think that there is a beleaguered group of people who have not worked and have come Ottery and don't feel like that that that their cadre.
BEAR3|I think that it's very alienating to just be zoom, zoom, zoom.
NEUT4|It's been a year since soon began to take take over it already of course started because people thought it was a great way to do business.
NEUT5|But David yeah it is.
NEUT6|I mean, if you're younger person you're trying to have, I mean to me I had tremendous Esprit with my class, of course, and that's where a lot of your friendships are made.
NEUT7|Frankly, lifelong friendships and oftentimes.
NEUT8|But now you're getting you're right.
BULL9|You're also getting the opportunity to work and learn from your superiors.
NEUT10|By the way, what I do here now, listen.
NEUT11|There are a handful of younger associates.
NEUT12|Think out there who probably enjoying wherever it is that they've moved, or but many of them were also want to be back in the office.
NEUT13|And the problem is, the Next up the sort of 40 plus.
NEUT14|Where maybe they have been vaccinated yet and getting those people back in so that you actually have your boss there.
NEUT15|They're going to get there, and we know Solomon of Goldman has been fairly outspoken in terms of what he feels is the need to have people return and return quickly.
NEUT16|I get a bit of a different sense when I've talked to the heads of some of the other firms that we know well in terms of their willingness to continue to allow their people to work from home or to be more flexible when it comes to time for a full reopening, which they hope will be through the summer and then probably by Labor Day.
NEUT17|Really, people?
BULL18|Back but more flexibility and add on top of that this is been a record year for a lot of these firms.
NEUT19|Yes, don't forget that I mean a record year working from home.
BULL20|It is amazing that they've gotten all this done.
NEUT21|David, I've got to tell you if we look at all the specs, the girl that you might be looking at the deal this remember we had to deal with this weekend and gigantic deal.
NEUT22|Yeah, and I, KSU, there's some work that weekend.
NEUT23|Somebody work that weekend.
NEUT24|And by the way, these roadshows.
NEUT25|They'll never do them that way.
NEUT26|Nobody's ever going on the road for a road show.
NEUT27|No, they're all they've all found.
NEUT28|It is so much more efficient to do it this way via zoom to reach as many people as you want.
NEUT29|That's over.
NEUT30|That's just over, you know, and then that gets back to our car or longer conversation about business, travel and how much of that will resume.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
