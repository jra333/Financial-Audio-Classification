BULL0|"""Hi everyone is CP investing here."
NEUT1|If you're new to the channel.
NEUT2|I am a college student who loves talking about stocks and finance and I have a passion about finding the next socks are gonna do well.
NEUT3|So let's get right into it.
NEUT4|So today I'll be talking about a stock that I think has a lot of potential moving forward that I have a decent amount of money in because I think it's a very safe play for the next upcoming months in the long term, especially so that stock is Clover health investments and I still think it's a bar right now.
NEUT5|It's definitely a buy right now.
NEUT6|I bought it yesterday around this 1250.
NEUT7|Something range if you can look right here.
NEUT8|1253 range.
NEUT9|I bought 80 shares then I bought another 50 shares on my first trade account and yeah, I really like this like this stock got hit by a bunch of short seller attacks.
NEUT10|Chamath papatya.
BULL11|I don't know how to say that guys last name but he really supports this company owns about four or 5% of this company so you know that this company is going to be doing well.
NEUT12|All the companies he backs up.
BEAR13|But 1995% of them have done well, and I still think that this company has a lot more room to run at my price prediction for this stock is $20 and I'll start trimming my position when it hits $20 or probably 30 shares on this account and hold 50.
NEUT14|Just trying to like get rid of my initial investment and just let the rest ride.
BULL15|So I still think there's a lot more room to run as we are talking.
BULL16|The stock has run up like $0.10.
NEUT17|The this talk is about health.
NEUT18|They're very transparent, which I like.
NEUT19|And yeah, I think this is a very good stock to invest in that has a bunch of upside, so I'll be keeping you guys updated if you guys want to see more videos about this.
NEUT20|What I'm planning to do on the stock in future videos and guys, you guys enjoy this content drop a like on the video and subscribe to the channel.
