NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also, for disclosure standpoint, I do own Facebook in my retirement accounts from the long side, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis over although a rough day now granted it was it's been a rough day, rough week for the markets as a whole, especially tech stocks.
NEUT5|But pointer being.
NEUT6|Actually, let me squeeze this down here.
NEUT7|Some interesting movement here going on, but I want to establish what I would consider a very important level going into next week, and that level is up here at.
NEUT8|The 271 mark and 271 is important.
BULL9|Just as a little quick history lesson because that had been a very firm area of support.
NEUT10|And then when the price did break down below it, there is a key update.
NEUT11|A key role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below, they tend to act as resistance, so going into the resistance here.
NEUT12|Check out right where the price then struggled after that point again that point right there while the price try to get up above there several more times and could never quite do it before eventually just working itself back downwards.
NEUT13|So I'm not saying that 270 ones impossible to break or anything like that.
NEUT14|I'm just saying from a tough goal and trading perspective.
NEUT15|If you want to formulate some trade plans or just want to understand more so the overall chart from an investing standpoint, yeah, 271 is definitely going to be a very important level where Anna give credit credits, do nice bounce here you know is there any sort of true power behind the bounds?
NEUT16|Well, the first big test of that will be how does the price behave if and when it can get up to that 271 mark.
NEUT17|So keep a very close eye on that.
NEUT18|From the resistant side of things and then also for more so than just the overarching area.
NEUT19|Keep an eye on purple line.
NEUT20|There, the purple.
NEUT21|Read me the 50.
NEUT22|Moving average you can see that's already presented a problem right there.
NEUT23|And that's just one of those moving averages that you called a cellphone prophecy called whatever you want.
BEAR24|When the prices down below it, it just tends to be annoying and act as an area of resistance as far as support levels are concerned.
NEUT25|Squeeze another charter to offer a bit more perspective on the show.
NEUT26|Yeah, it's been awhile since the price went down this though, but the current level of support right now that you're going to watch very closely, which was close today, but right down there around two 6150 and then after two 6150.
BEAR27|Next, key level down there right around the 259 mark, but overall rough week big downtrend prices trying to bounce.
NEUT28|But let's the other price behaves like that.
BULL29|If it can get up to that 271 mark.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird.
NEUT35|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT36|But in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT43|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT44|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
