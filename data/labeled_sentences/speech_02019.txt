NEUT0|"""So 11:00 AM Citigroup's conference call."
NEUT1|What is going to be the first question?
NEUT2|What are you going to do when you go back to the Fed?
NEUT3|Are you going to ask for the same thing or are you going to ask to return less capital?
NEUT4|Are you going to just table the whole thing until next year?
NEUT5|That's top of mind for investors and analysts, but it's not clear that they're going to get much of an answer because my understanding is the city is still trying to work through.
NEUT6|You know why they got different results from the Fed?
NEUT7|What the Fed got, and how they can sort of?
NEUT8|They're trying to get some guidance from the Fed about how to proceed right?
NEUT9|And you're talking about this last round of stress test, exactly which.
NEUT10|You know where they?
NEUT11|Basically it's trying to determine.
NEUT12|You know whether Banks will have enough capital to keep blending.
NEUT13|If we go through another downturn, right?
NEUT14|Which they say they do have enough.
NEUT15|the Fed said they did.
NEUT16|No one says fail right knows his path fail.
NEUT17|But City says that they did.
NEUT18|the Fed said they didn't in cities trying to figure out where the two what the difference is.
NEUT19|So City didn't fail they did.
BULL20|They did pass.
NEUT21|The issue is will they have enough capital if they go ahead and take some of that capital and give it back to shareholders in terms of a buyback or a dividend if they do that then then the Fed says yeah we think your capital levels are too low so that's where the issue.
BEAR22|And city, you know, feels at a disadvantage.
BEAR23|'cause JP Morgan and Wells and other banks have been buying back stock and raising their dividend city.
NEUT24|If you remember, you know they eliminative their dividend during the crisis.
BULL25|They only last year raised it to 1 Cent a share that compares to other banks that are like $0.30 a share, so they very much want to be able to do this.
BEAR26|How big a source of frustration was it for investors when the news came out that the stress tests indicated that City would not be able to carry out its plans as Horan?
NEUT27|If it was a source of frustration, does that push the bank in a certain direction?
NEUT28|It might not be ready to go into yet, meaning to try to propose something before it's time to actually propose it.
NEUT29|It was a big surprise both.
NEUT30|I think the city people internally and to investors everybody thought they were going to pass and it was sort of.
NEUT31|It was a *** ***** eye and it to investors.
NEUT32|It said, you know, this banks still doesn't really have great judgment here.
NEUT33|You know some investors I talked to said, why did they ask for anything?
BULL34|They should have just passed the test free and clear.
NEUT35|You know there.
BEAR36|They're trying to do too much too soon, so you know, I think a lot of people were very surprised and disappointed.
BULL37|Now, did you see anything in the earnings this morning that indicated maybe they're in a stronger position than they were back then?
NEUT38|Well, their capital ratios two and two that they disclose where one of them increased, and.
NEUT39|They you know, according to some analysts, they're only sort of very slightly behind JP Morgan on this measure, so that might help them when they go back to the Fed and give them a little more ammo to make their case.
NEUT40|But you know, we'll see.
NEUT41|Has there been any clarification on what the discrepancy is between what Citigroup found in its calculations of its capital position and what the Fed funds that you know?
NEUT42|That's sort of the big question that I think City is still trying to get to the bottom of, and we don't really have much.
NEUT43|Clarity on that.
NEUT44|Yeah, and what kind of kind of time frame are we looking at here?
NEUT45|Do we have any ideas?
NEUT46|Have to resubmit by mid June and then the Fed is expected to give their response within 75 days if not sooner.
NEUT47|So sometime in September.
NEUT48|Probably we should have answers.
BULL49|Alright, that's good.
NEUT50|We'll leave it there.
NEUT51|Suzanne capper.
BULL52|Thanks for coming on.
NEUT53|"Thank you too soon."""
