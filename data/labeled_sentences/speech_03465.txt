BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This be a video chart on ticker symbol GNUS.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute ioffer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Did this analysis on Tuesday, so let us where the green line here is coming from and now that green line just looks pretty silly down there, but believe it or not, it was actually relevant on Tuesday, but after today's monster movement, I'm just going to go ahead and adjust this level up to a more relevant area.
NEUT5|So one of the newest areas of support and what I would call the ideal love likely won't make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward.
NEUT6|That would be if the price can say up above $6.50.
NEUT7|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 650.
NEUT8|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, stand above 650 would definitely be a great sign of power.
NEUT9|Another area of supports keep an eye on.
NEUT10|Would then be down here around 565 so 650 and then 565 to the near term areas of support and then assuming you care about just the general chart as a whole.
NEUT11|So taking a step back and looking at everything from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving 'cause I get it, the price is way up there.
NEUT15|This line is way down there, but as the week plays out that line will move higher and higher and get more and more relevant.
NEUT16|So when it comes to just gauging the health of the overall move, this right here is how I'm defining the overall move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
BULL19|The Bulls are in full control, helping us visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what has been presented again.
BULL21|Yeah, sure, staying above 650.
NEUT22|That would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned, they truly just don't matter.
NEUT23|What do I mean by that?
NEUT24|Well, I think I've talked about this in past videos, but what matters the most is what the price is already been doing and that is this right here.
NEUT25|Just building these higher bases, or if you want to picture these stair steps so as long as the stair steps continue to be constructed in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking areas of resistance.
NEUT26|So just focus on the healthy consolidations, focus on building those higher lows and sit back and enjoy the uptrend.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
