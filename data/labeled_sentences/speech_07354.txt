BULL0|"""Three stocks are moving higher today on a recommendation in Barron's magazine I'm Jack cartereditorbarrons.com."
NEUT1|I'm here with Jack out with senior editor of the magazine.
BEAR2|So Jack, a lot of energy companies have been on fire, so to speak.
NEUT3|In recent years, Apache has not been one of the people, especially the past five years.
NEUT4|We've had a rough Patch, but now we're thinking maybe it's it's a goodbye.
NEUT5|So little bit of a bargain in the energy Patch.
NEUT6|It was kind of a sprawling company with assets.
NEUT7|All around the world, they had a big presence in Egypt.
NEUT8|They are very profitable there, but among things I hear from investors that they're looking for right now, it more exposure to Egypt is not really one of the company's sole Regent is kind of a place you want to stay away from with your money.
NEUT9|So the company has sold some of those Egyptian assets, so it still has a presence there.
BULL10|But really, it's kind of refocusing in North America where the growth prospects right now pretty darn good.
BULL11|So they have an opportunity to increase production here.
BULL12|They're bringing their capital spending to a more reasonable level.
BEAR13|You know it's it's the stock because of that underperformance.
BULL14|It looks cheap relative to its peers at a time when operations look likely to improve and they have assets in the Permian Basin and now really all I have to do is say Permian Basin and investors give you money.
NEUT15|So I think as they focus more on those domestic opportunity, I think the profile is changing is becoming a safer growth your company and suddenly looks cheap.
NEUT16|One great investor, Bill Nygren, doesn't actually like energy companies.
NEUT17|He just doesn't like the way they allocate capital.
NEUT18|He has a big chunk of Apache 'cause he says is not like the others.
NEUT19|Yeah.
NEUT20|Number two, PetSmart.
NEUT21|The directionality writes about it, and he thinks there's an opportunity there which you wouldn't think.
NEUT22|I mean, if I don't have a pet, so I don't know, but I would think I'd go to Amazon and get my dog food there.
NEUT23|Well, you might, but you can't go there and get your dog groomed, at least.
NEUT24|Maybe at some point in the future they will send over a drone to pick your dog up and groom, but they're not there yet so you know veto points out that there are a lot of services that they provide at PetSmart, not just the grooming but veterinary services boarding even training.
NEUT25|I don't know how lazy you have to be where you take your dog to PetSmart to get a train, but that's another story.
BEAR26|Alright, well the company you know the stock is really underperformed and there has been a fear among investors that hey wait a second.
NEUT27|This is a retail business that's going to go the way of Best Buy or something like that.
NEUT28|And you know, Vida argues, not quite.
BULL29|In fact, spending right now is very good on pets in this company.
BULL30|Has it has a great Moat in the form of pet owners who are going to continue to bring their pets there for services.
NEUT31|And once you get in the store, of course that allows you other opportunities to continue to sell goods.
NEUT32|Yeah, you have an emotional attachment to your pet that you don't have to your smart phone or whatever.
NEUT33|Now a furniture store pier one.
NEUT34|This is an ugly stock last week, but Chris Williams sees an opportunity.
BEAR35|The stock is really been all over the place.
NEUT36|I mean, there been times when it was over 20 bucks times when it was below a dollar.
BEAR37|But yeah, it got crushed last week and you know Chris Williams points out that look the haven't been the best results at the stores, but look what's going on with the online portion of the businesses.
NEUT38|Companies really focused on becoming a multi channel retailer.
BULL39|And they're actually getting some pretty good traction with their online sales, and they're doing a lot of things that provide some back and forth between the online business in the store business where people can come into their stores and check things out in the order.
NEUT40|And they have something delivered home.
NEUT41|And you know, or they or they order online.
NEUT42|They pick things up in the stores, and as that online business takes a larger portion of sales, you know this opportunity for growth here going forward.
NEUT43|So he thinks that that sell off as a buying opportunity on Pier One, and that dynamic is interesting because this showrooming is what's killing some retailers.
NEUT44|But with furniture, it's not as if you can kind of go on Amazon and find the same couch.
NEUT45|You gotta rub this watch Jack.
NEUT46|It's all about rubbing.
NEUT47|That's watch I didn't know that I didn't know that either until I read the story.
BULL48|Thanks very much.
BULL49|"Thank you."""
