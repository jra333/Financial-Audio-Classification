BEAR0|"""I remember at a year ago there was a lot of concern here about the uncertainty that it was so hard to sort of know what was going to happen because we were going into the kovit crisis and the economic fallout."
NEUT1|From that, do you feel a little bit more certain right now about what's the outlook is for the economy?
NEUT2|And I guess, more importantly, for the companies that you're following.
NEUT3|Yeah, thanks for that remain and I'll bring you back to principle one and some of the arguments that we made within that op Ed piece, which is prices are forward looking and so when you have unexpected events that may impact some companies more than other companies.
BEAR4|Last year we had an unexpected event through COVID-19 and that was very challenging for small cap stocks right at the start of the period.
NEUT5|Then you come into November and you have news around vaccines.
NEUT6|You have news around stimulus plans and so on so forth and that news gets incorporated into stock.
NEUT7|Price is very very quickly.
BEAR8|And so when you look at small caps or value stocks and you think about the forward looking view, those prices and those relative valuations are still far lower than what you have on the growth side of the market, so they're expected returns or higher.
NEUT9|But it's important in terms of having a daily approach to capture those expected returns, because what was small yesterday may not be smaller today and you have to be able to keep yourself focused and GME.
NEUT10|GameStop was a perfect example of that.
NEUT11|It was small and microcap one day and the next week it was a large cap stock.
NEUT12|What do you do in those types of circumstances?
BULL13|"And being able to respond to changes in markets to capture those premiums when they show up, I think is important."""
