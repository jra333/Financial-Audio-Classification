BULL0|"""Hello everyone, welcome back to my channel."
BULL1|So today Apple and Tesla has done the stock splits and their stock price also increased significantly.
NEUT2|So today I want to talk about why the company want to do stock split and so our investors.
NEUT3|What should we do whether we should buy, hold or sell the stock.
NEUT4|So now let's get started.
NEUT5|So the nature of socks blade is like divided the pizza from 3 pieces to six pieces.
BULL6|Although the whole market share doesn't change, there would be more shares to trade in the market and it would be possibly available for more investors to trade.
NEUT7|So I think there's basically two reasons why the management of the company will do the stock split, so first reason is management.
BULL8|Single stock price will increase significantly in the future one or two years.
NEUT9|In that case, if they don't do the stock splitting, the stock price would be too expensive for the individual investors like us.
NEUT10|So for example, before the stock split, the Apple stock price is $500 and after the splitting the stock price become.
BULL11|125 Although the company's value stays the same, more investors probably have a chance to invest in the stock.
BULL12|So that comes to the second reason is because the management would like to increase the liquidity of the stock and to encourage more people trading the stocks.
BULL13|So let us talk volume would increase.
NEUT14|The Apple stock has done the splitting several times since it was listed and every time they went a split they want to keep the stock price range.
NEUT15|Around $100 because they feel you around $100 in the stock price.
NEUT16|That can get most liquidity in the market, so a lot of investors may wonder if there is a stock splitting news, whether the investor should apply, sell or hold their position.
BULL17|So in my opinion, as an ounce of stock splitting news, the surprise has already increased significantly.
BEAR18|So at this time, like today, the stock price would be too high to get in the market.
NEUT19|Because it already pricing in the news, but I think the people who purchase stock before the stock split news announced like Apple announcer, the news in the early August.
NEUT20|So those people would benefit from stock split.
NEUT21|But if you are wondering whether it's time to sell the stock, I personally think that the stocks like Apple and Tesla they would keep for rising in the long term.
NEUT22|So if you are a long term investors, maybe you still want to hold a stock, but if your swing trader or short term investors.
NEUT23|I think now maybe it's a good time to take profits.
NEUT24|Yeah, so that's all my thoughts about stock splits.
NEUT25|"So hope you guys have a great trading day and I will see you guys in my next one, bye."""
