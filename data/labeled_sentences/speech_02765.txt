BEAR0|"""Elon Musk is had a rocky 2018."
NEUT1|It started in flames.
NEUT2|Or rather, flamethrower.
NEUT3|Must sporting companies hold about $10 million of these in just four days?
BEAR4|And the fire hasn't stopped for the billionaire CEO.
NEUT5|In February, SpaceX launched the world's largest rocket into orbit, complete with a Tesla Roadster.
BEAR6|And while the car might be flying high here, Tesla stock was about to take a nosedive after rising more than 7% to start.
BEAR7|The year shares sank lower.
BEAR8|As Musk announced a quarterly loss of $675 million.
BULL9|Still, Musk sounded optimistic of what was to come.
NEUT10|I hope.
NEUT11|Will that people think that if.
NEUT12|You know we can send a. Roadster to the asteroid belt.
BULL13|We could probably solve model three production.
BEAR14|Meanwhile, worries of a different kind of merged on March 23rd at Tesla Driver was killed in a crash involving the company's Autopilot feature.
BEAR15|The fatal incident sparked a federal investigation and Tesla shares tanked.
BEAR16|The company has defended its technology, blaming the incident instead on the driver, who it said wasn't paying attention to the road despite the car providing multiple warnings to do so, then back to back.
BEAR17|Bad news for Tesla as Moody's downgraded its credit rating and the company voluntarily recalled 123.
NEUT18|1000 Model S vehicles over a Bolt issue.
BEAR19|Shares hit their lowest point of the year after that week and after Moss tried to make an April Fools Day joke declaring Tesla so bankrupt.
NEUT20|You can't believe it.
NEUT21|Facing production pressure must begin sleeping at the Tesla factory.
BEAR22|He later said his fatigue contributed to this combative conference call in May.
BEAR23|These questions are so dry they're killing me.
BEAR24|Unsurprisingly, this sunk shares and angered investors next boring bonehead questions are not cool.
NEUT25|Next, still, Musk's goal was clear.
BEAR26|Produced 5000 model threes per week or the questions would persist.
NEUT27|Then at the beginning of July he and the Tesla team did it.
BULL28|It took an extra General Assembly line, hastily built in a tent outside the main facility to reach that long delayed goal, but workers and investors cheered the news.
NEUT29|How, how many help you with the world watching the Thai cave rescue?
BEAR30|The vocal CEO tried to help by building a small submarine, but he just ended up getting in a fight with the British diver on Twitter, but the real shock came on.
NEUT31|August 7th when Musk tweeted he is considering taking Tesla private and the surprise tweet which caused the stock to jump, 11% has drawn the government I the Securities and Exchange Commission is seeking more information about the disclosure according to people familiar with the matter.
NEUT32|"A Tesla spokesman declined to comment at the rate Musk is tweeting this year we are likely to see a lot more news."""
