BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This will be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the daily time frame before I get started.
NEUT3|From disclosure perspective, I do own shares of Apple on the long side, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
BULL4|So, and I don't mean the state the obvious, but Apple had a very nice day.
NEUT5|It was in the headlines, you know.
NEUT6|Buffett buying the 75 million shares and all that sort of good stuff.
NEUT7|But let's take a look at actually the technical perspective of things.
NEUT8|Looking at the chart and from that perspective it was also in the headlines because the price is now, you know, breaking through some very key levels and that key level that everything is kind of revolving around here is right here at this previous I'm going to call it just $180.00.
NEUT9|Yeah, give or take a couple of dollars but the you know kind of the moral of the story here is that the price has made a very nice move today.
NEUT10|Like I said stating the obvious.
NEUT11|But that brings up the very logical question though of, but is there any sort of true power behind this movement?
NEUT12|Is this the start of something bigger, or is this just some sort of kind of knee jerk reaction knee jerk reaction?
NEUT13|What do I mean by that?
NEUT14|Well, we already have a perfect example of a knee jerk reaction here, right here?
NEUT15|Here was a breakout above these similar levels, but you can see that actually was just what we would call a head fake a fake breakout, and after that the Bears took back over and pushed the price all the way back down here.
BULL16|So sure, yeah, the prices up above this $180.00 Mark.
NEUT17|But like I said, is this a true breakout or not?
NEUT18|I have no idea, but using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and it all revolves around the logic of price movements with true power that are truly strong are going to progress forward, right?
NEUT19|They're not going to go back to where they were.
NEUT20|I'm assuming you're saying hey thanks, Captain, obvious.
NEUT21|Of course, if your price movement has genuine strength behind it, it's not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT22|That would be a contradiction exactly.
NEUT23|So think about a dollar or 180.
NEUT24|Any sort of breaks below.
BEAR25|There are worse at the price separates of the downside.
BEAR26|Am I saying that the entire Apple chart is ruined?
NEUT27|I'm not saying that I'm just talking about today's price movement, but you know, if the price falls back below there, then today's price movement clearly doesn't have any sort of true power behind it.
NEUT28|'cause now the price?
NEUT29|If that were to happen, would literally be better.
NEUT30|You know, let me change the shape or there we go would literally be right back inside of that range that it already was at.
NEUT31|And again going back, not a sign of true strength.
NEUT32|Let's say something like this happen.
NEUT33|Price pulls back comes down here.
NEUT34|Come down here, like it did right here.
NEUT35|However, the opposite happens and it actually maintains and then starts ahead its way back upwards.
NEUT36|Unlike her work, as already pointed out, it goes downwards well.
NEUT37|What would you have in this case?
NEUT38|Well, in this situation, if the price were to do that, you have a set of Lowe's there.
NEUT39|You'd have some lows there.
NEUT40|You'd have some lows there you have some loads down there and you know what would you have.
BULL41|Well, you have progress actually starting to be shown so to me it's all for me.
NEUT42|It's all about 180 and as you know a long term shareholder.
NEUT43|Yeah, I want to see 180 hold, but just because one day it's great and it's broken through this level, there's still work to be done in the first bit of work to be done.
NEUT44|Is you know, not repeating certain types of past history and this history right here where the price broke above it and then it turned out to be ultimately fake because this 180 level is definitely a key level of resistance, you can see on several other occasions the price just flat out didn't even get through it.
NEUT45|And you know right up around this area.
NEUT46|So good day today, no doubt about it, but is today the start of something bigger?
NEUT47|Well if it's the start of something bigger than by definition that needs to show progress and how are we defining progress?
NEUT48|Well, let's see if the prices stay up above 180 or not.
NEUT49|One of the biggest questions that I get is likely, how do you find the stocks that you trade.
NEUT50|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT51|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT52|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT53|It's completely free.
NEUT54|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT55|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
