NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint I do own Apple in my retirement accounts from the long side, so just keep that in mind as you go through the analysis.
BULL5|Now I don't mean to say the obvious, but I'm anyways just to establish some Contacts, but a very impressive movement today.
NEUT6|When you think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here, yet it was able to eventually work its way back up in that area.
NEUT7|That was a very solid move, but that does little more than valid question of.
NEUT8|But is there any sort of genuine strength behind this price?
NEUT9|When is there any sort of genuine power?
NEUT10|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead Cat Bounce, site move and I have no idea, but by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
BEAR12|And that area is down here at that level of 116.
NEUT13|I don't get me wrong.
NEUT14|If the price was below 116.
BEAR15|So if the price comes down here breaks below it, does that mean that the entire Apple chart is destroyed?
NEUT16|I'm not saying that my point here is in reference to this movement right here.
NEUT17|What would it break down below 116 be representing?
NEUT18|Well that would be showing you that the price is all of a sudden gone.
NEUT19|Right back to where it was, I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly a true sign of true power.
NEUT20|Words.
NEUT21|On the flip side, casino pricing goes straight up, so maybe something like this happens where the price decides it wants to come back down, but the difference being behave like that and then it works his way back upwards.
NEUT22|Now over sudden.
NEUT23|What would you have while you have a set of those right here, you'd have that set of those right there.
NEUT24|If you envision each of those as stair steps, well, there you go.
NEUT25|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT26|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT27|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
NEUT28|It's going to make progress forward, and in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined again as that 116 mark as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT29|First, key level going to be that pink line right there, which is with a very well known 200.
NEUT30|Moving average.
NEUT31|You can see that's basically right where the price got rejected from this afternoon.
NEUT32|Current value of that is at 123, so keep a very close eye on that.
NEUT33|But anyway, look at it.
BULL34|Impressive bounce today.
NEUT35|Let's see if the price can build on this momentum next week.
NEUT36|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT38|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT39|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT40|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL41|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT42|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT43|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR44|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
