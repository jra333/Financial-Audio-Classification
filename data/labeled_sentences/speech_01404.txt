NEUT0|"""It was I'm David Hanson today joined by Fool contributor Jordan Wathan."
NEUT1|Jordan talking BCS business development companies and more specifically BCS versus REITs.
NEUT2|And there's people out there saying that BCS are the Nuer eats a lot of similarities here.
BEAR3|High dividend they have to pay out their income.
NEUT4|Are they really the new reads?
NEUT5|Is this the new asset class for income investors?
NEUT6|I'm not sure it's a new asset class for every income investor, but I do think it's it could be an interesting asset class for a lot of income investors.
NEUT7|And when you really think about REITs, an BDC Zahn.
NEUT8|BCS and newer obviously reads go all the way back to the 1960s, and so people look at this and they think, well, if Reese ramped up so quickly, you know.
NEUT9|So they grew really quickly through the 60s and 70s and then kind of died off and then blew up from the 90s to now.
BULL10|They're saying well, BDC's are there too, and Ares Capital Corporation actually kind of makes a good argument for this.
NEUT11|'cause they showed in one of their slides that they suspect there's $250 billion of annual middle market loan volume and they would be interested in this area expanding their the largest.
NEUT12|BDC, so maybe it's they have they have the outlook that they want the industry to become, I guess right exactly so they see it out there.
NEUT13|And when you compare it to the amount of equity capital out there right now it's only about 40 billion in public PCs.
NEUT14|So the comparison there it's fairly steep.
NEUT15|The difference between what's out there and and what's out there in public hands, right?
NEUT16|And over time I think.
NEUT17|I think you could see where early investors really benefit from being early on this trend, because we've only gone through really.
NEUT18|If you want to count 2003 is you know, kind of a cycle and then 2008 is a fairly significantly cycle.
NEUT19|I mean after the next say the next one and no one knows when it's going to be, but after the next one.
NEUT20|I think you'll really start to see who's who in the industry and who can underwrite right and one of the things you see in both the REIT industry in the BDC industry is management and whether it's external or internal management external.
NEUT21|Basically taking a fee based on assets or shareholder equity or whatever it may be.
NEUT22|You see that and reads.
NEUT23|NBC's Within an internal BDC.
NEUT24|Is that growth?
NEUT25|Does that benefit them more than an external because they benefit the shareholders of that internal internally management because the costs remain low as assets grow and income comes in right?
NEUT26|So I think for three BDC specifically Main Street, Capital Triangle Capital Corporation, an Hercules technology, growth capital there internally managed so the more they grow and the more they can spread out those fixed costs.
NEUT27|But on a bigger asset base the more shareholders would benefit, right?
NEUT28|So coming out of the next cycle.
NEUT29|If these guys under right as well as they have been historically, I think they could be leaders in doing that right?
NEUT30|I mean, I guess that's the biggest question mark, right?
NEUT31|Is the underwriting capabilities?
NEUT32|How much faith do you have in the management to make it through that cycle?
BEAR33|Because if they make bad loans and all their companies go belly up, or a vast majority of their portfolio, then they're not going to make it through this cycle there.
NEUT34|So that's really what you're betting on.
NEUT35|Here is the management team right?
NEUT36|It's always a jockey play.
NEUT37|And when you think about it, reads go back to the 60s BCS, go back to the 1980s so it's you know they still got a lot of catching up to do.
BULL38|Still maturing a little bit, yeah definitely.
NEUT39|"Alright for Jordan Watson I'm David Hanson fulan."""
