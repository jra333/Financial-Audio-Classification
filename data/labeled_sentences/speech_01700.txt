BULL0|"""Hi folks, welcome to another video from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I'm going Ben Alack now.
NEUT2|It's coming to war.
NEUT3|Luckily, I don't mean in the Crimea.
NEUT4|It's not World War three.
NEUT5|It's a supermarket price.
BEAR6|War Morrisons dropped, the hammer, declared war said it was going to cut prices and all the supermarket shares fell in response.
NEUT7|Why did they do that?
BEAR8|Because shareholders fear that this isn't going to be any good for them as they cut prices to try and win us back into their various shops that will come out of profits.
NEUT9|Now I think is quite interesting if you're Warren Buffett because he's been selling his Tesco shares over the last year.
NEUT10|We've seen himself about quarter shares.
NEUT11|And yet there at least three reasons why this kind of news.
NEUT12|This kind of environment might bring buffet back into Tesco.
NEUT13|First one is everyone hates supermarkets.
NEUT14|Buffett said many times you should be greedy when others are fearful.
BEAR15|Well, people are definitely fearful of supermarkets at the moment, just shows about Â£3.00, which is where they were yonks ago.
NEUT16|Pretty much where Buffett first port.
BEAR17|They've come way down as the markets going up.
NEUT18|No one wants a supermarket.
NEUT19|Reason number one reason #2 the shares look fairly cheap.
BULL20|Therapy of about 10 get about a 5% dividend yield that is a lot better than the market on both of those metrics.
NEUT21|Obviously there's a reason for it, which is that Morrisons is declared a price war, so the rosiest Times owner supermarket, at least you're buying it cheap.
NEUT22|Potentially the third reason is kind of in some ways most interesting people bang on about Buffett buying cheap companies whatnot, but he really likes to buy good companies with strong companies, should we say, and in a commoditize sector?
NEUT23|Strongest company is really the lowest cost producer supermarkets most with live near at least couple of the supermarkets.
NEUT24|I live near.
NEUT25|All four of the major supermarkets so I can choose whichever one I want to go to.
NEUT26|The one with the lowest price is very attractive to me.
NEUT27|Might be able to paint the store a nicer color, or have someone say hello when I walk in.
BULL28|But ultimately if I can leave with a few more quid that is going to win the day for me.
BULL29|And really Tesco has the best chance of winning a price war.
BULL30|Its operating margins are 6% thereabouts.
BEAR31|Probably going to come down a bit.
BEAR32|But even then it comes down to 5%.
BEAR33|Was Morrison's already below 5% Sainsbury's down at about 3 point something percent?
BEAR34|What this means is that Tesco's cut prices, because it's got more margins that can afford to give up to keep giving its customers the cheapest prices and keep bringing them into the store.
NEUT35|It can fight the war for longer, and it can.
NEUT36|Hopefully if you're a Tesla shareholder win the war.
NEUT37|Does this mean that Buffett would be going back in and loading up on Tesco shares?
NEUT38|Again?
NEUT39|Personally I doubt it.
NEUT40|I think the problem with a price war is like.
BEAR41|Any war it can go on for years it can be very bloody.
NEUT42|No one, you know someone will be a Victor.
NEUT43|No ones really winner.
BULL44|They cut their prices, could take a long time for them to get the prices back up again to improve their margins.
NEUT45|"So I think probably Mr. Buffett would rather sit on the shares he's got and watch from the sidelines."""
