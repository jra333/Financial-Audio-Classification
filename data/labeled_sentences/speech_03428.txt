NEUT1|They're doing things.
NEUT2|Can they will?
NEUT3|Can they do this?
NEUT4|A combination games computer hardware.
NEUT5|Can they really do battle with the likes of Amazon?
NEUT6|In E Commerce space, maybe to a certain extent as far as game stuff is concerned.
NEUT7|Yeah, it would be more of a competitor to what Best Buy?
NEUT8|Well, it's hard to say because I would say Best Buy probably thinks of its biggest competitor is Amazon.
NEUT9|Yeah, you see what I mean.
NEUT10|It's like everybody's competitors.
NEUT11|Amazon.
NEUT12|Some point in China sells something, yeah, but yeah, I mean immediately.
NEUT13|Best buys in there.
NEUT14|But like Best Buy, for example, they do have GPS and things like that, 'cause the recent story talk about how GameStop is going to be retailing GPU's moving into PC hardware and things like this.
BULL15|But they could expand it.
NEUT16|I don't know what are the rules here.

NEUT24|A drop ship.
NEUT25|Certain things take different risks, carry a wider variety of bigger inventory of goods, sure.
BULL26|Anyway, it appears that they're trying to put together the right people to actually put up a fight, and it's in line with what I had been saying.
NEUT27|Previously about.
NEUT28|Taking advantage of the light that's been cast on him right now, you know, soaking it up.
NEUT29|Because it's the brand is kind of shining right now, and so you make a few hires.
NEUT30|You attract certain talent and you use it to your advantage.
NEUT31|"Yeah, so this is one of those examples."""
