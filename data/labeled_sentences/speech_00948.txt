NEUT24|To explain how your losses are unlimited.
NEUT25|Consider this graph of price versus profit.
NEUT26|Let's say you buy a stock for $100.
NEUT27|The most you can possibly lose is the amount that you paid for it.
NEUT28|In this case, $100.
BULL29|As the stock price goes up, your profits will continue to go up as well.
NEUT30|Theoretically there is no limit to how high the price can go.
NEUT31|Now consider that you have shorted the same stock at $100.
NEUT32|In this case you profit when the price decreases.
NEUT33|The most you could stand to make is the price that you shorted that.
NEUT34|In this case $100.
NEUT35|However, as the price goes up, your losses go up and since there is no limit to how high the stock price can go up, theoretically there is no limit to how much you can lose.
NEUT36|While shorting is an effective way to make money when stock prices go down.
