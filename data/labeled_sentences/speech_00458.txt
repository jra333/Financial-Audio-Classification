NEUT14|Let me see what I told you.
BULL15|We had a nice resistance.
NEUT16|Said yes if this thing fly up to $8.16 soon as we break their eight sixteen 817 this thing is going through the roof guys so I hope you are loaded up gatcha shares in on this.
NEUT17|In just 'cause I said, it's going to explode today.
NEUT18|It always can be manipulation that plays part in the stock market and Bitcoin is looking very very lovely.
BULL19|Yesterday I told you how Bitcoin sitting right around 54, fifty $5000 Bitcoin has grown over the night, has regained his games, came right back, set resistance around $57,000.
NEUT20|It's a bull 57,000 now, trading at closer to 58,000 and you know got another resistant points at fifty 9004 can get better at 1260 K Mart.
NEUT21|And once we get up there, man, this thing could go through the roof.
BULL22|Guys, I was expecting a nice pull back with Bitcoin but for Bitcoin to be holding in the 50K range like that.
NEUT23|Man, that's just that's just insane.

NEUT30|And a good spot for getting for any newbie, so any new new people around there that's feeling like you might be too late.
NEUT31|It's not too late.
NEUT32|You can get in on SOS around if you see this thing pull back, pull all way back around 747 thirty.
NEUT33|I get some shares.
NEUT34|Then if you see it pulled all the way back to around 696 eighty I get some more shares and if it pulled all the way back you might not see the fives again.
NEUT35|Most different, but if you do 595 eighty I grab some.
NEUT36|And then we go and ride this sense screens.
BEAR37|This stops cradle to around $15.
NEUT38|We can sell at 1516.
NEUT39|We can buy back in on the deal and write it again and sell again.
NEUT40|Rinse and repeat.
NEUT41|And then that last.
