NEUT0|"""We saw the same thing today in B&G Foods."
NEUT1|You know we've had them one bed bath.
NEUT2|We've had them onto, they've got short positions of 36% and 63% respectively.
NEUT3|They're going after rocket mortgage with a 31% short.
BEAR4|It's crazy out there.
BEAR5|Bed bath beyond stock, which opened up for 34, then leaped to 47, squeezed out by the cheerleading smaller investors, and then it plummeted $30.68 to finish up just $0.47 to squeeze.
NEUT6|Didn't stick.
NEUT7|My advice to the shorts, I'm not going to give any advice to the Wall Street Reddit crowd.
NEUT8|They're making a lot of money, but my advice to the shortstop crowding into the same trades.
NEUT9|Leaving yourself open this kind of action, you'll never know who Wall Street bets will target next.
NEUT10|Now.
NEUT11|Not all of these targeted buying campaigns are about busting the shorts.
NEUT12|Some of these talks they aim for are genuinely loved and they think are very undervalued.
NEUT13|Here.
NEUT14|I'm thinking BlackBerry.
BULL15|It's got a good software business Palantir, both of which had gargantuan runs today.
NEUT16|They're so loved in the Wall Street best crowd doesn't seem to want to stop by at these levels.
NEUT17|They always look at use these targets like the analysts were too enthusiastic, but as entertaining as these moves are, this stuff is only.
NEUT18|A side show at the end of the day, I don't think a Reddit form can bring the house down there.
BEAR19|Picking undervalued stocks better big short position and running with him and that can cause crazy moves in a handful of stocks.
NEUT20|But it's not big enough to move the entire market.
NEUT21|Come on.
NEUT22|What really matters now?
NEUT23|Is that we have a stock pickers market for the first time in 20 odd years?
NEUT24|This is a market that rewards individual companies from being well run and that means stocks are less sensitive to the broader economy than they used to be.
NEUT25|Now we know many of the biggest winners thrive in a shutdown because they enable the stay at home economy.
NEUT26|Remember that stayed on the car.
NEUT27|We've got three that just get indices galore to show this stuff.
BEAR28|I think most of tech has gotten overheated these levels.
BEAR29|The endless price target boost for the same induction Apple are very unnerving to me.
BEAR30|They set a high bar that can hurt the market.
NEUT31|There's a whole quality stocks that are.
NEUT32|Roared from Microsoft.
BEAR33|That Tesla, Boeing, AMD, and they could really hurt us if they get hit with a big battle profit taking all at once.
NEUT34|But of these, only apples at its highs right now, Meanwhile want to cover reports.
BULL35|A decent quarter is Kimberly Clark.
NEUT36|It today the stock source hated the Crocs, followed up and sympathy one please.
BEAR37|I'm 22 points of four stocks go down just as much when they disappoint and that's what happened to IBM last week.
NEUT38|It's a market of stocks people.
NEUT39|So the bottom line, with the exception of a handful of gigantic tech place, there isn't a stock out there that's big enough to bring down this market.
BULL40|If anything, the quality of earnings this week starting with J tomorrow which is not at all sense of the economy, could be a terrific sign that made big cap stocks are immune to a slowdown.
NEUT41|And unperturbed by the crazy action in marginal names like GameStop or being seafood, or even a rocking horse in bed, bath and beyond.
