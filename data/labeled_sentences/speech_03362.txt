BULL0|"""Larry Kudlow on this show top White House economist, says the economy is coming roaring back."
NEUT1|His words Anthony Chan is with us former chief economist at Chase coming roaring back the economy.
NEUT2|Anthony, do you agree?
BULL3|I think that is the third quarter is going to give you a very strong number.
NEUT4|Stuart I I'm looking for a 20% GDP number on annualized basis.
NEUT5|Keep in mind that the Atlanta Federal Reserve their model is now forecasting 25.6% growth.
NEUT6|An research that I've done finds that that's one of the most accurate models of forecasting real GDP.
BULL7|So I'm really very optimistic about the third quarter.
BULL8|But I am still a little concerned about the fourth quarter because we really need a little bit more stimulus out there to help us out.
BULL9|We see a lot of factors out there that are helping residential real estate is coming back real strong in the third quarter, but remember it's too that is just three point.
NEUT10|3% of the overall economy manufacturing is coming back and it's roaring, but that's only 11% of the economy.
NEUT11|We still need other aspects of the economy to come back and and those factors are just a little bit uncertain for the fourth quarter.
BULL12|But right now for the third quarter, Stewart, I am very optimistic.
NEUT13|OK, what would a Joe Biden win do to the economy?
NEUT14|Not the markets.
NEUT15|What would a Biden win do to the economy?
NEUT16|Well steward when I look at research that I've done looking at presidential election years, they're generally positive.
NEUT17|In fact, during presidential election years, you get about 11% rate of return.
NEUT18|But one thing I do find and that is that markets don't like a change in the political party.
NEUT19|It doesn't matter steward whether it's it goes from Republican to Democrat or Democrat to Republican.
NEUT20|The rate of return in the market is almost four times greater when you keep the political party that's in.
NEUT21|In power in the White House, in power and re elected so if you see a change in political party you should see that the equity market this year historically has not been as strong as if the same political party in the White House has stayed in power OK, got that Anthony Chan.
BULL22|Thanks for being with us this morning.
BULL23|"I think we'll see again soon."""
