BEAR2|Alright, let's get started NIO as well as other stock were down to Fridays, selling pressure to Wall Street with major market benchmarks giving up ground but finishing well off their worst levels of the day.
BEAR3|The Dow Jones Industrial average joined the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite with declines.
BEAR4|Shares of NIO are down 8% on Friday due to the markets volatility.
NEUT5|But where does that leave Nio with all the volatility in the market surrounding it?
NEUT6|The answer is to look at the market and how it is trading overall market analysis.
BEAR7|The stock market rally is in a modestly weak trend showing elements of a broad based pull back as well as a sector rotation out of growth.
BEAR8|The NASDAQ, S&P and Dow Jones fell intraday Friday to just above its 21 day exponential moving average, where it began paring losses.
BULL9|The 21 day line was a key area of support for the NASDAQ during the April to November stock market rally as well as the current uptrend.
