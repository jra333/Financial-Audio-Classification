NEUT0|"""Hey guys, today about busy UN."
BEAR1|I've been away for a couple of days.
NEUT2|I went to Las Vegas so have some fun there.
BULL3|So yeah I'm back.
NEUT4|I'm back to buying stocks about busy UN today.
NEUT5|As you can see, it had a nice little Cup right here.
BULL6|Came down a little bit so it broke out of this resistance.
BULL7|Right here came down and then a couple of days ago, about 6 days ago I broke out again on the right here starting to come back down from overbought territory I picked it up today, around $53 or so, so I'm hoping that the stock goes up.
NEUT8|Uh, we go here we go so you can see right here that the EPS ratings 97.
BULL9|So it's doing very good and also the Rs ratios 94.
BULL10|So it's doing better than most of the stocks out there.
BULL11|Plus it did form a new high.
NEUT12|The IRS forms a new high as the stock formed a new high.
NEUT13|So let's keep an eye on this.
