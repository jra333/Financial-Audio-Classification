NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, it's Dave Aquino at base camp trading and this is the free video for Wednesday."
BEAR1|February 10th so looking at this market action in Amazon today, we've been waiting for this breakout to the downside.
BEAR2|We broke below previous stays low 3297.
BEAR3|Looking strong move down all the way to 3255.
BULL4|I really think this has an opportunity to continue to fall tomorrow.
BEAR5|If the market doesn't have an extreme bounce, I think Amazon could continue its weakness.
BEAR6|I'd have to look for a break below today's low.
NEUT7|Which is 3254.
NEUT8|I'd be looking for a test of the 50 day MA at 3233.
BEAR9|OK, Amazon's wreaker broke lower.
NEUT10|Didn't bounce with the rest of the market.
BEAR11|All of the first part of the week and continue to look weaker.
BEAR12|So I am looking for Amazon to continue this bearish breakout to the downside.
BULL13|"Thanks a lot."""
