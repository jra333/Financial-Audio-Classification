NEUT5|For those of you who aren't familiar with a DMA, a DMA biologics is a late stage biopharmaceutical company.
NEUT6|That develops manufacturers and intends to market specialty plasma based biologics for the treatment and prevention of infectious diseases.
NEUT7|The company is engaged in the development and commercialization of human plasma and plasma derived therapeutics as per a Dmas investor relation page.
NEUT8|They currently offer a multi faceted revenue generation platform, currently producing revenue from contract manufacturing and laboratory services plasma that they are providing to third parties and three FDA approved products with additional products currently in development.
NEUT9|One of Adm as primary products is Ivy IG.
NEUT10|And speaking as a physician, I can say that Ivy IG is commonly used in the hospital setting and we use this for many autoimmune and pro inflammatory states.
BULL11|As you can see, a DMA has consistently seen an increase in their revenue and most recently reported revenue of just shy of $7 billion and they're projecting to see that revenue continued to grow over the coming years.
BULL12|In light of the pandemic, a DMA and other pharmaceutical companies specializing in plasma based products have joined together to accelerate the.
NEUT13|Production of products to treat the inflammatory storm related to the virus.
NEUT14|Adm A is a very speculative company currently trading with a market cap of approximately $200 million.
NEUT15|Taking a look at the three month chart, you can see that a DMA has been bouncing around the $2.00 to $2.50 range over that timeframe, more recently by taking a look at the five day chart, you can see that a DMA was trading just under $2.00 a share until we saw a recent uptrend to around $2.40.
BULL16|And now have started to see it pull back this up trend in the stock price comes off of upgrades from analysts who have upgraded the stock to a $7.00 price target which would equal over a 260% gain.
BULL17|I definitely could see the stock price pull back further to that $2.00 support, but this may be a great opportunity to buy in because a DMA definitely seems to have a lot of growth ahead of it.
