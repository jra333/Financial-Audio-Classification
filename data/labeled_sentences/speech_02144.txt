NEUT0|"""In our opinion, I think we're only halfway there through what I believe is a super cycle."
NEUT1|I mean our checks in terms of Asia continues show not just iPhone 11, but China.
BULL2|Overall I had expectations and I think it's a drum roll into five.
BULL3|Gina Re rating on the stock so I many will say OK stocks up 75% year to date.
NEUT4|I think only halfway through.
NEUT5|That's why I think three 50s next week.
NEUT6|So 5G is the next thing that everyone is waiting on.
NEUT7|The question is do you believe there will be a 5G phone come fall of 2020?
NEUT8|Yeah we just came back on our China trip and we believe you'll have 4 phones.
NEUT9|That will be 5G enabled and the key the key question right now is of the install based every 350,000,000 that's in the window of an upgrade opportunity.
NEUT10|I view 5G is open up the floodgates right for the next.
NEUT11|What I view is a super cycle and I said one other question later than I wanted to jump on the five GPS.
NEUT12|This enabled idea is actually very interesting 'cause there's going to be a lot of people who are going to maybe want the enabled version, but if 5G is not really meaningfully available except in major cities where people actually.
NEUT13|Upgrade next year or do they say 2021 is my year when the when the full network might have a better shot at being out.
BULL14|I actually full network around the country in a meaningful way.
NEUT15|Could be a 2022 project and I think right now when you look at I think you have to look at Apple is there's going to be 2 parts of the upgrade you have the 2020-2021.
NEUT16|What I love about the Supercycle thesis is right now about a third of the install base.
NEUT17|They have not upgrade their phones in 39 months so we're going into it's going to be a super cycle and I think you could have a mix of 4G5G.
NEUT18|But that's right now what I love about this.
NEUT19|Set up an Apple and a re rating of the stock.
NEUT20|Even though the skeptics continuing to get multiple, you get a multiple kind of multiple expansion, so to me it's really the services Business Today.
NEUT21|"I think it's worth 500 billion."""
