BEAR1|In today's NIO, stock analysis and predictions why NIO stock is trading lower today?
BEAR2|What happened Nio stock opened lower on Friday after the Chinese electric vehicle maker said that it will issue at least 60 million shares in a new offering next week.
NEUT3|As of 11 AM AEST.
BEAR4|Nio's American depositary shares were down about 5% from Thursday's closing price.
NEUT5|So what Nioh said without it will sell up to 69 million new American depositary shares raising as much as $2.8 billion in an offering that is expected to hit the market next week.
NEUT6|The company plans to use the new cash for a variety of corporate purposes, including new product development, the development of self-driving technologies.
BULL7|And to expand its sales and service network.
NEUT8|Neo definitely plans to sell sixty million shares.
NEUT9|It's under writers, including Morgan Stanley, have the right to purchase an additional 9 million shares within 30 days.

NEUT11|Lyoto which raised about $1.3 billion last week and spank, which announced a $2.2 billion stock sale on Wednesday.
BEAR12|Niles stock likely traded lower following the news because of investor concerns about the dilutive effect of 60 million.
NEUT13|Or possibly more new shares.
NEUT14|Now what auto investors should be clear about this now, like its rivals isn't in urgent need of cash.
NEUT15|This is a very different situation from earlier this year when I urgently sought additional investment.
BEAR16|At a moment when it was close to going broke.
BULL17|The company is now in good financial shape with or without this extra $2.8 billion, but the thinking and I think it's wise thinking, is probably that it's not a bad idea to raise some extra cash at a time when investors are snapping up electric vehicle stocks.
NEUT18|The offering is expected to price on Monday.
BULL19|In summary, Neo is still a great stock to purchase.
BEAR20|This is a temporary drop.
