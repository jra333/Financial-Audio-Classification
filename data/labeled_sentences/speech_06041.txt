BULL0|"""Have a guys welcome back to a new episode."
NEUT1|In this one we're looking at sundial growers stock because now somebody's stock has officially passed $2.00 and that might not sound like a big deal.
NEUT2|But actually guys it is.
BULL3|And in fact in the past five days we have seen the price rally all the way up to almost $4.00.
BULL4|So we are seeing a big increase in share price and then a subsequent self while guys in tights video giving you all of my personal opinions going forward into the next week and all that kind of good stuff guys.
NEUT5|If it sounds like an episode that you might enjoy, make sure to leave a like and subscribe to the channel because we are trying to grow the channel.
NEUT6|As fast as possible, but with all that being said, Please remember I am not a financial advisor and I thought throughly recommend that you do get own research before investing in any stock.
NEUT7|With that being said though, let's jump straight into the video.
NEUT8|So Bingo, sundial growers stock over the past five days.
BEAR9|Well we have seen a lot of volatility.
NEUT10|Would you look at that and the start of the week?
BULL11|We were touching $1.14 we rocketed all the way up to highs of plus 246% which took us up to about $4 and ever since.
BEAR12|We have actually been down now.
BULL13|Still, if you bought something at the start of the week you would be up about 82%.
BULL14|According to Googles charts which is quite a significant increase for one week.
NEUT15|But you know what would this sell off that we have been seeing?
BULL16|I think we're in a much better position going into the next week.
NEUT17|So can we see some tiles drop in?
NEUT18|Or will it go even further?
BULL19|Well, guys in my personal opinion, I think next week is going pretty fantastic.
BULL20|For sundial stock I definitely can't see a huge increase of up to $4, But guys you just never know with this stock it never fails to disappoint and it does make sense that this one is going up by quite a bit.
NEUT21|Let's face it, the company's market cap is about 3.24 billion, which is huge for what it is.
BULL22|And of course this company does have a lot of room for growth in its industry.
NEUT23|Anyway, I think not.
NEUT24|A lot of people are getting attention to sundial.
BULL25|It probably is going to start to grow a bit more.
NEUT26|I said in previous episodes that I couldn't see it passing $2.00, but of course a lot has changed now a lot more people are aware of Sundial stock.
BULL27|I think subsequently we are going to see this price continue to go upwards now into the next week.
BULL28|I can see a bit of growth coming.
BULL29|I think it should be a bit more stable growth.
BULL30|Hopefully as long as we can pass about $3 by the end of the week will be in a fantastic position.
NEUT31|And by the way that is a bit more optimistic.
NEUT32|Target, on the other hand, I wouldn't be surprised at all if we passed about $1.50.
NEUT33|Our very conservative estimate as well, but even then.
BULL34|I don't think that's a bad position to be in, because of course we have seen Sundial Rocket by quite a significant amount, but definitely can see this next week being pretty positive for some.
NEUT35|Well, I think now is one of the best opportunities to buy.
NEUT36|Ultimately guys I would wait until Tuesday morning just to see what happens.
BULL37|Because yes, there is still the possibility that we could come back down to the downside, but personally I would like to see a state in the $2.00 range, or at least a high $1.90 range.
BULL38|And if there is a case I think will be in a fantastic position on Tuesday to go forward and see this share price explode into the new week.
NEUT39|So please do tell me down below what you personally think somebody is going to do.
NEUT40|I think this week is gonna be pretty interesting.
NEUT41|I think they will have quite a big influence on what happens next with Sundial, but if it is positive it will be a great influence to see.
BULL42|So guys I hope you enjoyed the very quick video.
NEUT43|If you did, please do leave a like and subscribe and I will see in the next one goodbye.
NEUT44|"Until then, thank you for watching."""
