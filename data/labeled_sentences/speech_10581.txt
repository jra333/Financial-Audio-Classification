BULL0|"""Jim, what did you think of the debate last night and just watching Bernie Sanders now kind of strengthen his lead?"
NEUT1|Look, I I'm I'm not a political guy I watched it.
BEAR2|I cringed when Mayor Bloomberg didn't have the tax returns like Clint cringed at his jokes.
BEAR3|I cringed because obviously the audiences didn't like it.
NEUT4|Was a lot of times you listed the audience you make up your own mind.
BEAR5|It was painful if you're.
NEUT6|If you know, Mayor Bloomberg is painful because you're, I think wealth was really under fire last night.
NEUT7|And I came back like Joe and just how did this get to be that?
NEUT8|If you're?
BEAR9|If you're wealthy in your Democrat, it's just bad news.
NEUT10|And I think that's a shame because you know, this is the party now of revolution, and the Republican is a party of preservation.
NEUT11|Revolution distribution seems to be what people want in the Democratic Party.
NEUT12|I don't recall this ever you ever quote like this, no, but it's crazy how much people enjoyed this debate him, and I'm trying to figure it out.
NEUT13|I guess it's a commentary on our times, but remember previous debates where that you weren't allowed to applaud and I was thinking if that's so hard, it's so boring when you can.
NEUT14|And last night, what made the whole thing, where the booze and and suddenly I felt like I was in the Colosseum?
NEUT15|The Roman Colosseum and I'm like.
BEAR16|And I felt bad.
NEUT17|I felt like I was avoiding it.
BULL18|Yeah, I was really enjoying it.
NEUT19|Alright, we're in this.
NEUT20|We're in the same boat.
BEAR21|I mean, that's exactly what I said I said wow that was bad.
BEAR22|Yeah, because the audience said it was bad and TurboTax.
NEUT23|Well yeah, I mean these things are barred from now on June.
NEUT24|I mean, I gotta hand it to MSNBC from now on, can we not tell him not to applaud that they have to be quiet?
NEUT25|I mean that it's.
NEUT26|"I mean, I think that be better."""
