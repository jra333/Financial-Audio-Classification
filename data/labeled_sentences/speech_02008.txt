NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol CIDM."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyway just to build some context here, but the last 30 minutes of the day, absolutely crazy volume came pouring in.
NEUT5|Price just went kaboom.
NEUT6|So moving forward, it's a more than valid question of.
NEUT7|OK, great move, but is there any sort of true power behind this problem?
NEUT8|And is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT9|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce type move here and I have no idea, but by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward.
NEUT11|And in my mind, or balls on a single area, and that area is down here at $1.65.
NEUT12|Why is it Dollar 65 so important?
NEUT13|I'm not saying this is what's going to actually happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT14|If the price were to come down here, Dollar 65 behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would you have all of a sudden you have the price quite literally, right back to where it was.
NEUT15|And I mean not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT16|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything of that nature.
NEUT17|But to be fair, Nope.
NEUT18|Nope, breakout can just go straight up either.
NEUT19|So maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner, then starts to work its way back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden, what would you have while you have a set of those there you'd have lowest down there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps, well, hey, there you go.
NEUT21|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction, and that's the name of the game.
BULL22|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT23|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as the dollar 65 mark in terms of areas of resistance moving forward.
NEUT24|Next key battleground to watch very closely going to be right up there at the Dollar 97 mark and then after $1.97, next key level up there right around $2.15.
NEUT25|So keep running those couple areas moving forward, but no doubt about it.
NEUT26|Crazy crazy way to closeout the day today.
BULL27|Big surge, big volume.
NEUT28|So let's see how this one carries into tomorrow.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT39|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.

NEUT41|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.

NEUT43|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
