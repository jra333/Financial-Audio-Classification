NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, it's David Keno with base camp trading and this is your free video for Friday November 20th."
BULL1|So just a about 30 minutes ago Netflix really started breaking higher out of this consolidation again.
NEUT2|Got some good news about.
BULL3|Netflix is dominant in the streaming area, so making a strong move towards the 50 day MA at 495.88.
NEUT4|If this thing continues, I think we can easily get to 500 E 505 hundred 501 and then if it does continue this area around 5:15 is the next Gen target again.
BULL5|First time in awhile I was strength in that Netflix breaking out of the consolidation pattern we've been in for weeks.
BULL6|I think there's an opportunity for more upside in this stock.
BULL7|"Thank you."""
