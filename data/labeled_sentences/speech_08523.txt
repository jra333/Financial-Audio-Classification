BULL17|It was doing amazing.
BEAR18|It literally was under a dollar going up to $2.00, almost $3 dropping down to a dollar, reaching $2.00 again and then right now dropping to $1.33.
NEUT19|There's a lot of things you guys need to understand before you invest into this stock.
NEUT20|Now we go over here guys.
NEUT21|Zomedica love the pets but not the stock.
NEUT22|So there's one thing that you guys really need to understand of what is going on in this right here.
NEUT23|You need to understand.
NEUT24|OK so right now if you have to know penny stocks are risky.
BEAR25|OK, it's risky there.
NEUT26|Not a long term investment.
NEUT27|Most of the people just like doing no short squeezes.
NEUT28|You know they trading them.
NEUT29|But there's one thing as we really need to understand about.
NEUT30|Zomedica OK, the question right now is should you buy the dip.
BEAR31|You know it's pretty low.
NEUT32|People are going to buy the dips or should you avoid the hype.
NEUT33|You know once people start hyping it up it might start going up.
NEUT34|You know it's up to you if you want to invest in it or not.
NEUT35|OK, but there's one thing is really need to understand.
NEUT36|OK, basically right now when it comes to this company here ZOM, there's actually no revenue but they have a really high market cap, OK?
NEUT37|That's the one thing is need to understand.
BEAR38|Zomedica is still company with no revenue but a market cap of $1.54 billion.
NEUT39|OK, that right there should show you.
NEUT40|OK that it's very hard to predict where this company is going to go.
NEUT41|It has 00 reports.
NEUT42|OK on sales so it's like it's a flat line.
NEUT43|Basically it's like it's hard to tell you don't know where the company is going.
NEUT44|You don't know where the stock is going to go.
NEUT45|It's very hard to analyze.
NEUT46|OK so once again right now we're stuck where?
NEUT47|Zomedica, you know it's going to be hard to predict, but for sure it's not hard to predict that people are going to buy the dip.
NEUT48|So Medical was a hot stock, a really hot penny stock and I know for a fact when people see that it's low, they're definitely going to buy and investors are going to hop into it and it's going to get hyped, but let me know what you guys think.
BULL49|I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT50|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys on my next video."""
