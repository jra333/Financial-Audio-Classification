NEUT0|"""Now, I haven't had in my hand and new Brawl V, which is the AbbVie you seem to have."
NEUT1|Even sales, but you're a fraction of the size of energy.
NEUT2|So we have a sales force that's about 2/3 of their size, and we're under spending them on DTC.
BULL3|I think what's giving us the edge in this space is the fact that we have a very heavy digital first campaign, and in addition to that, we're making sure that we use the power of the patient voice to spread the word about the differences between nartec and the competitor products out there, and it's been effective.
NEUT4|Well, I have to tell you I saw something that I've never seen before.
NEUT5|It's a March 15 note from an analyst from Piper Sandler, great analyst.
NEUT6|Who literally just talks about how he has migraines, and he takes migraine I should say.
NEUT7|And he takes sertec.
NEUT8|I've never seen anything like it.
NEUT9|He talked about what his condition was, why he took it, and realized 30 minutes until the center close.
NEUT10|It worked for him.
NEUT11|I mean, it's not often that you get something that's incredibly unsolicited as an analyst.
NEUT12|Saying that it works for you.
NEUT13|Well, you're right.
BULL14|Jim and Tyler Van Buren's report about how his migraine was relieved by Nartec was very compelling, and it's what we've been hearing from patients for years.
NEUT15|And I have to say that right now we get about 1000 social media communications every single week from patients talking about their nartec experience.
BULL16|That's what makes me confident that if you deliver a good medication for patients, you're going to have an excellent business model.
NEUT17|And that's what we're trying to confirm.
