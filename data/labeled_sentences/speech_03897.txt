NEUT0|"""Hi, it's Steven Smotherman from fulltimefba.com and today I want to show you how to find items that are hidden on Amazon because Amazon is currently out of stock for those items."
NEUT1|Most of you know that Amazon is a very customer centric website.
NEUT2|Everything that they do is to make the customer happy an what's one of the worst things the customer can do.
NEUT3|They could find a product page where an item is sold out and they can't buy it.
NEUT4|So what Amazon does is they hide those product pages once they're sold out.
NEUT5|Now there might be times where you're wanting to find those items that are sold out on Amazon, but you might not be able to do it just by using keyword searches on Amazon.
NEUT6|So today I want to show you the trick.
NEUT7|On how to find the items on Amazon that Amazon is sold out of, let me show you right now.
NEUT8|Alright, so we're on Amazon.com and let's just say we're looking for this little plush lion pillow pets, and so we're like, OK, let's find the product page for this plush lion pillow pet.
NEUT9|So you type in lion.
NEUT10|Hello pet.
NEUT11|And we're like, OK, let's see if we can find it.
NEUT12|So he starts searching down.
NEUT13|We start seeing Lions and.
NEUT14|Penguins and elephants.
NEUT15|And so we don't see.
NEUT16|The one that we're looking for.
NEUT17|So like maybe it's sold out.
NEUT18|And so you look over here on the left side and you know there's different ways to refine your search.
NEUT19|So you got categories you can refine by Amazon.
NEUT20|Prime size, age reviews, new and used.
NEUT21|But there is one option over here on the left that is missing.
NEUT22|That allows you to search out of stock items.
NEUT23|Now let me show you how to find that what you can do.
NEUT24|There's two ways to do it.
NEUT25|What you have to do is narrow down your search to a category to not just search all of Amazon, but to just choose one category.
NEUT26|To do this search and there's two ways to do that.
NEUT27|You can click up here in the search bar.
NEUT28|And Scroll down to choose toys and games.
NEUT29|'cause this lion pillow pet is a toy and game.
NEUT30|Or you can just click this first search result for toys and games category.
NEUT31|Over here on the left.
NEUT32|But basically what you're doing now is your choosing to search in the toys and games category.
NEUT33|And now.
NEUT34|When you Scroll down, there is a new option for you at the very bottom.
NEUT35|Availability include out of stock so you click this little button here.
NEUT36|And all of a sudden you come up with a whole new set of search results.
