BEAR0|"""What is going on guys?"
NEUT1|So we're going to be looking at Netflix overall and seeing how much profit can you truly make of it, right?
BEAR2|So if you guys don't know Netflix had a pull back a little while ago due to earnings, and as you can see, the pullback was quite tremendous, it won't drop to about $125 back then.
NEUT3|I ended up getting in at around 480 and I ended up selling when it was right about $500.
NEUT4|So I got in.
BULL5|Close to right here and upselling right here, which is a good.
NEUT6|Like profit for me.
NEUT7|In my opinion, it was a quick night swing trade to other held it for about 2 days and I was good but.
NEUT8|Right now it's at 498, right?
NEUT9|So let's look at the upside and the downside of Netflix.
BULL10|So overall Netflix, since it is at 498 and it can reach higher highs with everything that's going on since.
NEUT11|Netflix even said its own.
NEUT12|Its biggest competition is actually sleep, which I kind of find actually almost true.
NEUT13|So how high can it go right?
NEUT14|If it goes back to its previous site, you can make 17% around 15% profit.
NEUT15|Now if it goes back down to the earnings report crash, which is a strong support.
BEAR16|You can lose 10% profit, right?
NEUT17|So right now it's 15 to 10.
NEUT18|So what does that mean overall for Netflix now?
NEUT19|I'm not telling you to buy or not buy, I'm just giving you kind of the ups and downs of if you were to buy right now.
NEUT20|Is there a better time to buy on Netflix or should you just go in at it right now?
NEUT21|So personally, right now I would then have to go to the one day, 5 minutes short.
NEUT22|Now I would say Netflix is quite low.
NEUT23|Even right now it can.
BULL24|Easily go up to 510 which is around 3%.
NEUT25|So right now based on the bottom VWAP the lowest in my opinion that it might go is from the point is that right now then the next couple of days will be like 1 to $2.00.
NEUT26|So overall in my opinion.
NEUT27|Being able to buy right now.
NEUT28|I would personally buy right now.
NEUT29|And then I would wait it out.
NEUT30|Up until a little bit passed over because of strong resistance is at the 533 market so close to there would be strong point to sell, or if it reaches that then you can hold on.
NEUT31|So at that point I would sell part of my position size and then if it gets rejected I would sell the remainder.
BULL32|But if it ends up breaking above I would be happy that I held on to that so overall.
NEUT33|Netflix right now, 15% upside 10% downside, is it a buy?
NEUT34|In my opinion.
NEUT35|I would personally buy it right now.
NEUT36|But again, that is all up to you guys.
NEUT37|I'm not saying to buy or not, but I'm just giving you the percentage and kind of the pros and cons of what will happen and the resistance levels.
BULL38|But again, right, it has resistance levels at 5:13.
NEUT39|Ann at 5:33 and obviously at 575.
NEUT40|So overall that is basically it for this video, just pros and cons of what would happen if you went into Netflix right now, but other than that I hope you guys enjoyed this quick little video.
NEUT41|Just some upside and downside.
NEUT42|If you want me to do more like this or want me to really go into technical and fundamental analysis of a stock, just comment down below.
NEUT43|And that thing is so much watching.
