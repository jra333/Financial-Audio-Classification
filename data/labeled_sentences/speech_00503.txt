NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Intuitive Surgical is ranged between $11.70 per share and $109.50 per share."
NEUT1|How are those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $11.70 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $11.70 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Fair enough, but how about the high end?
NEUT5|Paying $109.50 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings, so price of $109.50 represents a fractional payment that we don't pay.
NEUT6|For the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings, this is a conservative way to value the company using future earnings, which is different from calculating its PE ratio.
NEUT7|So the big question is, will I have two questions for Intuitive Surgical?
NEUT8|What do they do and what are they trading at now?
NEUT9|So Intuitive Surgical what they do?
NEUT10|Is they manufacture, develop and market robotic products designed to improve clinical outcomes of patients.
NEUT11|In other words, they make robotic surgeons, which is incredibly fascinating.
NEUT12|However, this price is not so fascinating.
NEUT13|It $691.08 to buy one share of Intuitive Surgical and their PE ratio is telling me that that price is.
NEUT14|Inflated so we can take these signals and come to the reasonable conclusion that, well, it's overpriced.
NEUT15|Now we have that understanding, so we don't waste any for the time on.
NEUT16|On analyzing the company's fundamentals, but just because of this fact alone, what would be the alternative?
NEUT17|So we want to park their money somewhere that's going to give us a similar return with similar risk.
NEUT18|Maintain our safety of principle and maintain an ample margin of safety.
NEUT19|If we were to transact so as opposed to Intuitive Surgical, then we would invest in Vanguard 500 index fund Admiral shares.
NEUT20|Now they're not paying me to say this, but Warren Buffett.
NEUT21|Used these guys so he invested in this fund to win a bet against the hedge fund industry, which is why I always default to this index fund.
NEUT22|You can choose any reasonable fund.
NEUT23|Make sure you do your research on them, but basically we would invest in these guys.
BULL24|Look at this return 13% plus over the last 10 years, which is pretty comforting.
NEUT25|We would invest in this fund until.
NEUT26|This price here so Intuitive Surgical share price is 690 drops below the 109 fifty strike price and even then we would want to do is calculated fundamental analysis.
NEUT27|A deeper fundamental analysis looking at its cash flow statements, their balance sheet, their income statement and just to gain a better understanding before we were to trade our money for a piece of their pie, so to speak.
