NEUT0|"""Hi fools and welcome to another Motley Fool video with me, Sonia Ray Hill and today I'm joined by Chris Niles."
NEUT1|Welcome Chris.
BULL2|Thank you very much.
NEUT3|Yeah, so Chris is a relatively new investor.
NEUT4|He's been investing for a year or so.
NEUT5|Is that right?
NEUT6|Absolutely, but I hear you're you've got a number of sort of 3D printing shares on your watch list right now.
BULL7|Yes, you're absolutely right.
NEUT8|Why is 3D printing?
NEUT9|Well, to be honest, I'm a bit of a self confessed tech geek and I like companies that come up with sort of brand new innovative ideas that can really help make the world a little bit more of an interesting place.
NEUT10|And 3D printing certainly fits the bill with that for me.
NEUT11|I guess the best way to explain it is imagine if you were at home and your dishwasher broke down and you phoned up the tech people to fix your dishwasher and they told you that you need to get a brand new part in that would take about four weeks to be delivered and then someone had come fitted for you or for one little piece of plastic.
NEUT12|Now imagine if you could go online.
NEUT13|Download the spec for this little piece and print it off yourself and just fit it.
NEUT14|How much more brilliant and exit without makeup, but yeah, that would make my life really, exactly, exactly and it's it's really.
NEUT15|Things like that.
NEUT16|So it's basically the concept of being able to print things out of maybe resin paper obviously as well in 3D format.
BULL17|And yeah, I think is an absolutely fantastic idea.
NEUT18|And there are three shares and that I'm watching that sort of really have a focus on this new technology at the moment and that one of them is a complete 3D systems whose ticker is triple D. There's another one called Strata Sys, whose ticket is SSYS.
NEUT19|And the final one is a pretty well known share in the UK, and that's red and shorten that sticker RSW now.
BULL20|3D systems has been particularly good.
BULL21|It's gone up for around about, I think about 62% since June strategies, so that has a similar result, and that's got about 58% since June and Renishaw a little bit further down the path.
BULL22|But still a pretty decent return of around about 30% since April, so they're all pretty good.
NEUT23|They're all a little bit too expensive for me at the moment to buy into, but I won't be watching them.
NEUT24|And if I was going to pick out one, I think 3D systems for me is an American firm, but they've managed to Peyton.
NEUT25|Using Microsoft Connect, I don't know if you know that, but it's basically a almost like the Nintendo Wii ask thing where you're basically being watched by sensor and all your movements are picked up by the system in this used in video games.
NEUT26|But 3D systems actually managed to combine this with their printing, so you can actually just show an object to the Microsoft Connect software and it'll actually pink it, print it and sort of do it that night.
NEUT27|That, for me is just, you know, an amazing piece of technology.
BULL28|And yeah, I can see myself maybe becoming a little bit invested in that so.
BULL29|Yeah, you might be an expert in every way, maybe yeah, I've definitely learned something new.
BULL30|Actually Chris, so thank you very much for that.
NEUT31|That's three 3D printers.
NEUT32|"Feel what Smith."""
