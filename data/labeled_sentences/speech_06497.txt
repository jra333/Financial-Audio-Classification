NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|Today we're looking at Euro USD on the daily chart, so zooming in we can see that euros correction below the 200 day simple moving average is transmitting a growing bearish tone.
BEAR2|The falling 50 day SMAD appears to be heading for a bearish crossover of the 200 day so may as well, which would further power the negative picture that flatten in blue kitchens in line is reflecting the minor bouncing the pair.
BULL3|However, they chamaca lines are back in.
BULL4|The price is decent.
BEAR5|That said, the short term oscillators are conveying conflicting signals in directional momentum.
BEAR6|If cell is remaining control, preliminary downside constraints may develop at the nearby 1.17 zero three barrier.
BULL7|Steering beneath this and more profound push from sellers could be required to conquer the crucial support base of 1.16 to one sixteen 25.
BULL8|Should this key foundation fail to negate the decline from *********** the Bears may then target another significant support zone residing between one point 1496 and one point 1451.
NEUT9|Otherwise, if buying interest intensifies, resistance could originate from the one point 1786 immediate level until the one point 1835 inside draft, the former being the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the upper leg from 1.08 seventy to one point 2349.
NEUT10|Overcoming this boundary that 100 ASM a lingering above at one point, 1885 may impede buyers from propelling higher to challenge the heavy resistance section of one point, 1946 to 1.20, which also encompasses the 50 day SMAD.
NEUT11|Successfully stepping over the latter, which is the 23.6% fibo litchmore cloud and the 100 day SMH.
BULL12|Currently at one point 2046 could then attempt to calm by his confidence summarizing the current bearish outlook will strengthen further.
BEAR13|Should Euro USD remain below the one point 1786 to one point 1835 barrier and the 200 days in May?
NEUT14|That's it for me.
BULL15|"Have a great trading day."""
