NEUT0|"""Following along with emerging trends and changes in the online world can be like a full time job."
NEUT1|In fact, for Chris Prendergrast, an on line marketing strategist for Click Rain Marketing in Sioux Falls.
NEUT2|It is full time work he watched carefully as Facebook shares were made available for the first time just three months ago for the first time, kind of rounding out their growth, and so a company with 900,000,000 users.
NEUT3|That's great if it was at 800,000,000 last week, it was at a billion last week.
NEUT4|That's not so great.
BEAR5|And so the IPO, the timing of it was may be dangerous for the stock market.
NEUT6|But Prendergast says for the general public, getting tide up in the stock value of Facebook isn't necessary.
NEUT7|That's because signing up for the free account is nothing like making an investment in stocks for users and for businesses too.
NEUT8|It's not so much of a gamble to try out a new service for investors.
NEUT9|It's a different story.
BEAR10|Prendergast adds the fall of Facebook's value shows that the online world is still full of as many question marks.
BULL11|As it is potential dollar signs, but despite apparent troubles on Wall Street, Facebook is still a solid source for online marketing.
NEUT12|For companies across the country, that's where the volume is at.
NEUT13|So even though you may not want to.
NEUT14|Invest in a share of it.
NEUT15|You definitely want to be where the people are and right now that's still at Facebook and perhaps Facebook's launch into public trade will offer lessons for other companies as the tech world continues to evolve in Sioux Falls.
