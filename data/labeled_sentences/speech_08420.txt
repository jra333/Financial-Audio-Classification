NEUT23|It's funny thinking back to Bitcoin at $0.25.
NEUT24|They didn't think I'd see $1.00 then at $8.00, many investors had enough calling it in US coin and sold out.

BULL32|XL I'm making a triangle formation after a bullish run looking for a breakout in the bullish direction.
BULL33|A retest of the now support line and a further bullish run keep at it.
NEUT34|So guys we are sitting at $0.29 an I gotta tell you guys we were at $0.08 for about the entire year of 2020 and then we had this this run up here.
