BULL0|"""Netflix, the stock is flying this morning."
BULL1|Are they finally over the this stumbled major stumble from last summer when they split the services in two you can see their shares up 13% at 8143, looks at 13% rise.
NEUT2|Sounds great, but let's not forget where they were a year ago and even where they were in June, right?
NEUT3|You can see there.
NEUT4|That's the year Charts Company was above $300 a share a year ago.
BEAR5|Fell as low as 60.
NEUT6|Justin, just a month ago, so still much closer to the bottom than the top Steve Rusila.
NEUT7|But tell us why is Netflix doing so well today, so big jump today and a lot of it is attributed attributed to what the CEO Reed Hastings said on his Facebook page on Tuesday.
NEUT8|He basically bragged about the company streaming business, reaching 1 billion viewers, 1 billion billion dollars, writing our billion viewers.
BULL9|It be awesome.
NEUT10|Well, there's the statement from him off right?
NEUT11|1 billion hours of video last month were stream, so you know, he said it was a record.
BULL12|Obviously a big accomplishment, and he's expecting even more in the future when they get original content.
NEUT13|The likes of House of Cards and Arrested Development Development.
NEUT14|I would say that it is.
BULL15|It's exciting, it is, but anyway, so you know the stock had a nice run up on Tuesday, up 6%, but it's getting an even bigger bump up today, up 13%.
NEUT16|There's a lot of options activity going on in the stock right now.
NEUT17|There's people are making some pretty bullish bets.
BEAR18|This is sign that the they had a major public relations disaster last year when they said they were more than just appeared right right?
NEUT19|It's more than just appear when they said they were going to split their offerings that have an online streaming and the Mail thing.
NEUT20|Not to mention the pricing, not right, is this a sign that they're actually over that now?
NEUT21|What is the street saying?
NEUT22|That's a great question.
BEAR23|I think that a lot still needs to be answered when the company reports earnings in a few weeks, their earnings report is for the end of July, so you know, I think especially they had a stumble in April.
NEUT24|Their growth numbers were not as great as people work, anticipating so you know, there are still a lot of those questions that you ask Paul are going to be hopefully be answered when the earnings report comes in June, but I think that if you just look at the stock price now, yes, it's a little bit above 80 right now.
BEAR25|That's nice and it's off the low of 60.
NEUT26|Just a month ago, but still.
NEUT27|It was over 300 a year ago, so that is this huge.
NEUT28|As you said before, is much closer to the bottom than it is to the top right now.
NEUT29|Which begs the question, is there a lot more room for the stocks around higher and you had a Citigroup analyst?
NEUT30|Let's ask the question, you can ask.
NEUT31|Any other tenants.
NEUT32|Could you put both?
NEUT33|Let's plug it right?
NEUT34|We have a post or market Peterbilt with market beat and Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney came out earlier this week and reiterated his buy buy rating and has $130 price target on the stock and says that, you know from a value it just.
NEUT35|Merely from a valuation perspective, the stock is cheap, the stock is cheap and it has room to run higher, and so he said yes.
BULL36|The company had a lot of missteps over last summer, but if you take into account just how well the company did in the years past and put those PR stumbling blocks aside, the company has generally done pretty well, and so hopefully will continue to do well in the future, so he's pretty bullish on the stock, and he's one of the best, well known one of the most well known Internet outlook.
NEUT37|You know.
NEUT38|It's interesting you knew they were going to have to get out of the Mail order business at some point and go into something.
NEUT39|Seems like now they did it now it started.
BULL40|Maybe take a little traction exact, that'll be good for the company.
NEUT41|All right.
BULL42|"Steve Russell, thank you very much."""
