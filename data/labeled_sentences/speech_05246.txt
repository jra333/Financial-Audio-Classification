NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, this is chatting me and then of the chart guys."
NEUT1|If you look down in the description we've got a link to our new website and encourage you to check it out and give the 10 day free trial is shot were hanging out in the chat room all day and would be happy to teach you technical analysis.
NEUT2|We post annotated charge throughout the day and we have multiple eyes on the markets looking for different entries and exits for more profitable trades.
NEUT3|Looking at Netflix on the daily and weekly time frame.
BEAR4|You can see today that there was a bit of a pullback on increased volume.
BEAR5|As the chart was overextended above, the Upper Bollinger Band, we had a Red Day yesterday and the Red Day today confirms the bullish excuse me.
BEAR6|The bearish reversal.
NEUT7|That being said, earnings did just come out after the Bell.
NEUT8|An Netflix is currently trading at 108 after it closed at 90.
BULL9|So that's a huge move to the upside.
NEUT10|Congratulations to any of the winners who were holding Netflix stock kind of wish.
NEUT11|I held on to mine many many, many months ago.
NEUT12|That's another story.
BULL13|Anyways, I would have said that we would expect the Middle Bollinger band to be tested on this pullback tomorrow.
NEUT14|Obviously the earnings negate it.
NEUT15|Sometimes the charts you know they do a great job of giving you a glimpse of what's likely to happen, but this chart doesn't tell you that earnings are coming out and a 10% move was factored into the price, so this chart doesn't really have much information in terms of current information.
BULL16|But we do know that the price is going to open at a new all time high tomorrow.
NEUT17|Way up here is going to be a big gap to fill.
NEUT18|Just like here it might not fill.
BEAR19|This looks like a chart that has run away lots of runaway gaps.
NEUT20|As you can see here.
BEAR21|This cap did not fill and Netflix is just in Beast mode.
NEUT22|This is going to turn into a giant.
NEUT23|Green candle stick.
NEUT24|You can see that the Upper Bollinger Band Resistance is 108 twenty four because there's no price history on the daily chart as this will be an all time high for Netflix, this is your best bet for resistance right here.
NEUT25|One oh 824.
NEUT26|In fact, I bet that's exactly where we're going to see pullbacks start happening.
NEUT27|An after hours trading in premarket trading and you better believe that 108109 tomorrow we're going to see some resistance so I will check back in tomorrow after closed to see how that.
