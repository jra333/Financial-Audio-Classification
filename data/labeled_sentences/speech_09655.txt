NEUT0|"""At its Giacomo speaking."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this video on Apple stock in front of us.
NEUT2|There is one hour candle stick and with my technical analysis interpretation as usual, always.
NEUT3|Please read a lot of news.
NEUT4|Get yourself confident with this talk from the fundamental analysis point of view and then we can get confident a little bit more from the technical analysis point of view and this is what we are doing right now.
NEUT5|But please read the news.
NEUT6|Get confident with fundamental analysis and as usual threat to match both fundamental and technical analysis and there should be a course on the same page.
NEUT7|This is my tracking analysis interpretation.
NEUT8|Without it, this is how this price looks like and as you can see these amazing exponential moving average worked very well as trendline support for some of those bottoms.
NEUT9|You can play around with the length of this support, but it seems that more or less you worked.
NEUT10|Or indicatively at least he worked there.
BULL11|Support for this uptrend.
BEAR12|So we are in this uptrend.
NEUT13|The major one is following my mouse.
NEUT14|Please is this one?
BULL15|This is the Mount major uptrend and it seems that now we are ready.
BEAR16|We are in a situation where almost the the price is ready to go up.
BULL17|So the stochastic seems ready to go up.
NEUT18|We are close to the this exponential moving average that should it.
NEUT19|Was this one that did not work support but if you can start playing around with perhaps 250 let me see Arotis evoked support their work.
NEUT20|They support their perfectly.
NEUT21|And we are so the idea is that it seems that this Apple seems ready to go up.
NEUT22|So with my technical analysis interpretation and it is where we are.
NEUT23|So idea is to go long.
NEUT24|Of course, target price first target price 139 U.S. dollars, second target price 145 U.S. dollar before going along.
NEUT25|Just because this one, you know this is going to be neutral in the line so it's a tentative then the line as well as this one.
NEUT26|So there may be still an option that the price.
NEUT27|King cake could could keep going down up to, let's say approximately 128 U.S. dollar before going up again, so this option is still valid.
NEUT28|But generally ladies to go long.
BULL29|So yes, because again Stochastic seems ready to go up.
NEUT30|And if let's say if if Monday this this talk will start going up just full of it.
NEUT31|Let's go long, but otherwise if you see that it's going to go down and perhaps this trend line.
NEUT32|The one the first one is going to be broken and then even the second in the line is going to be broken is it's not a good sign because you might mean that the price the prices will keep going down, so that's why would the idea is to go along.
NEUT33|Of course, if you won't risk from from tomorrow, just keep going along, but otherwise if you want to be on the conservative side that I always suggest.
NEUT34|Just wait for Monday to see what's gonna happen and just be sure that this trend line or this turn the line will not be broken before.
NEUT35|Long because prices.
BEAR36|Again, my keep going down up to 120 approximately and then the prices will go up again.
NEUT37|But boot options mean as one and first option.
NEUT38|Second option supported them.
NEUT39|They go log so the idea is to go longer.
NEUT40|Just wait for the right time.
NEUT41|It seems right time from from tomorrow because the stochastics telling us that is in oversold, so it seems ready to go up, but to be again a little bit more sure of that weight and just to be sure that this deadline and then distant.
NEUT42|Will not be broken before going long.
BULL43|"Thanks a lot for watching this quick video, bye."""
