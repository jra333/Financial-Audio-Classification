NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up everybody."
NEUT1|I am Jason and you're watching my channel Micro investor art.
NEUT2|So in this video I have an important question.
NEUT3|What is better?
NEUT4|Coke or Pepsi.
NEUT5|And I'm not talking about flavor.
NEUT6|I am talking about the stock.
NEUT7|Which one is better, Coke or Pepsi?
NEUT8|So first let's talk about brands.
NEUT9|Both these companies have a lot of great brands behind them.
NEUT10|Obviously there are huge in the soda industry, but they're also both in the water juice.
NEUT11|Sports drink an energy drink business as well, but unlike Coca-Cola, that mainly specializes in beverages, Pepsi actually also is pretty big in the food industry as well.
NEUT12|A lot of people don't know like your breakfast might have a Pepsi product in it because Pepsi owns Quaker Oats and not only that, your usual trip to the convenience store where you go get a bag of chips.
NEUT13|Well, Pepsi owns Frito-lay, so Doritos Fritos Tostitos.
NEUT14|They're all part of Pepsi.
NEUT15|So currently at the time of filming this video, Coca Cola is trading at $51.39.
NEUT16|Pepsi is trading at $130.09.
NEUT17|The market cap of Coca Cola is 222 billion.
NEUT18|An pepsis is 187 billion.
NEUT19|Both these companies real popular amongst dividends.
NEUT20|Dividend investors Coca Cola's dividend currently is 3.07%.
NEUT21|And Pepsi's dividend is 2.87%.
NEUT22|So let's go into the income here.
NEUT23|As far as revenue goes, Coca Cola's revenue is 32.5 billion and Pepsi's is 63.3 billion gross profit.
NEUT24|Coca Cola's is 20 billion and Pepsi's is 35 billion.
NEUT25|Now dead, Coca Cola's debt is 45.5 billion.
BULL26|An Pepsi's debt is 32.6 billion, so as far as revenue and debt, Pepsi looks better right there.
NEUT27|But really matters, is what stock is performing better?
NEUT28|Now I'm sure a lot of people are going to think it's Coca Cola, because the great Warren Buffet invest in Coca Cola.
NEUT29|But if we look at over the last five years.
BULL30|Coca Cola has gone up 22.39% and Pepsi has gone up 44.22%.
NEUT31|So as far as which one is better as far as growth, I'd say Pepsi.
BULL32|Personally that one, just you know, is performing better and it has more room to grow LED.
NEUT33|Dip it in.
NEUT34|But I'm invested into both these companies.
BULL35|I like them both a lot and I will continue to invest into both these.
BULL36|Alright, well I hope you got some use out of this video.
