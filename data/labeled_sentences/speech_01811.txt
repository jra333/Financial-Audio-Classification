NEUT0|"""Let's get to the stocks on our radar in our man behind the glass, Steve Burton is going to hit you with a question."
BULL1|Ron Gross, you're up.
NEUT2|First, what are you looking at this week?
NEUT3|I gotta radar stock.
NEUT4|Not a recommendation yet.
NEUT5|Boston, Omaha BOMN.
NEUT6|It's a small cap, stock only about $600 million market cap under the radar.
NEUT7|Early stage conglomerate, which is funny.
NEUT8|Early stage conglomerate, but they invest in businesses with attractive economics.
NEUT9|Mostly right now an outdoor advertising allow billboards an surety bonds insurance.
NEUT10|They also hold some home building real estate services and some other things to really strong leadership to investment guys.
NEUT11|Right now they're only taking minimum wage as a salary until they can grow this thing, so I really like kind of how they are aligning themselves with shareholders.
NEUT12|Steve question about Boston, Omaha.
NEUT13|What's the most memorable billboard you can remember, Ron?
NEUT14|Well, I think about on the way to Vegas.
NEUT15|There's some very interesting they've billboards that you see as you get closer to the strip.
NEUT16|Jason Moser.
NEUT17|What are you looking at this week?
NEUT18|Taking a look at a new IPO recent IPO here called Event Brite ticker is EB.
NEUT19|As I said they just went public so there isn't a whole heck of a lot of information out there beyond the S one.
NEUT20|But this is a tech platform in the form of an app and also desktop.
NEUT21|But ultimately the components for individuals and groups to plan.
NEUT22|Promote produced live events and this helps them do that without having to go to a number of different providers.
NEUT23|Helps drive ticket sales and that's ultimately how they make their money is by getting the fees from these ticket sales.
NEUT24|The interesting thing about this company management is led by husband and wife team of Kevin and Julia Hearts and if Kevin Harts sounds familiar.
NEUT25|Criswell Kevin Harts was also behind the founding of Zoom, which is a company that was recently acquired by PayPal and.
NEUT26|You know, I liked it a lot.
NEUT27|You are very bitter about that little bit are you want to zoom to be a stand alone public still harboring a little bit of it to Steve question about Eventbrite?
NEUT28|Sure with all the video streaming that's going on in this world today, do you worry about that kind of taking a hit at Eventbrite?
NEUT29|Well, I think there's an opportunity potentially to leverage what they're doing with partners, whether it's Live Nation or we've seen Live Nation with Twitter, for example.
NEUT30|Start offering some video streaming there, so I think there are a lot of different ways they can leverage that content with social partners to be able to get that out to bigger audiences.
NEUT31|David, what are you looking at?
NEUT32|I'm looking at Vail Resorts ticker MTN.
NEUT33|I believe this was Maddie's radar stock last week so I'm double dipping here, but this is the company behind ski resorts and they're increasingly diversified across different seasons, so summer and winter and geographies around the world.
BULL34|Dividend yield an all time high 24 times free cash flow.
NEUT35|Taking a look Steve.
NEUT36|How do I know when I'm ready for the black Diamond?
