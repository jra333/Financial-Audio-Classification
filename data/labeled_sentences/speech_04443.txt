BULL0|"""Coax up 3% premarket despite organic revenue."
NEUT1|Jim down 26, which as far as our databases go you gotta go back a quarter century almost 30 years to see a number that bad in 1/4 well but I think that James we speak to James he's rather upbeat because the quarter as it went on did get better remember his company is heavily exposed to restaurants quick serve two is better than just fine dining heavily exposed to cafeteria's not it cannot be made up.
BULL2|With supermarket an ecom sales but I have tremendous faith that this that the worst is over.
BULL3|Things can come back and there I look at the models he does of China which is starting to do much better and I think that that will carry over.
NEUT4|Obviously if we re close it's not good and a very small percentage of his business is just traditional restaurants that are not coming back.
BULL5|So I think the cadence of the quarter as they say on these calls was very positive.
NEUT6|Yeah, we'll see where Quincy says in the next hour.
NEUT7|Sarah is going to bring him.
NEUT8|Yeah, he did talk about Jim.
NEUT9|Something that we we see repeatedly from other companies and that is rationalization of the offering, right?
NEUT10|SK you?
NEUT11|Zombies, I think he calls them which will be called.
NEUT12|Yeah, I mean everybody.
NEUT13|Just you just have to have sent send fewer SK use.
NEUT14|And I I think that the toughest thing when I talked to James the tougher standards I said listen, I ordered a couple quarters of Coke Zero and he came and I love it and I thought that that would be the beginning of.
NEUT15|I thought others would would do the same.
NEUT16|And it was done at the beginning, but it's not being done as much now.
NEUT17|And so while I like that the stock is up, I don't know if it can stay up because these stocks are not the stocks that people love.
BEAR18|These are unwanted stocks and I just say that PepsiCo had a great quarter.
NEUT19|If you look at Frito lay where they also rationalized excuse, you would think that Pepsi is gotta be ramping here 'cause it was much better than Coca Cola when it comes to freedom like no mean.
NEUT20|Yes got the greatest chart in the book and stocks to only go up.
NEUT21|I said I've mentioned that this segment but PepsiCo is a better stock up stock down then Coca Cola but right now people are just to name of Coco 'cause it's just done nothing for so long.
NEUT22|Have a Warren Buffett with Coca Cola, Coca Cola, Wells Fargo and need me there used to be a Occidental American Express American Express David.
NEUT23|Thank you airlines welcome so yeah, well no longer doesn't own the airlines anymore.
NEUT24|We should point though that's true but I know that David Portnoy did say that he's not at the top of the game.
NEUT25|"Anyways, Warren Buffett's not at the top of his game."""
