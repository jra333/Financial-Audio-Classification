NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Hope you're having a great day is always First off.
BULL2|I wanted to thank you guys for the amount of support I've seen on my channel.
BULL3|We're almost at 30 subscribers and we're growing so quick.
NEUT4|So help us grow and smash that like button.
BEAR5|If you enjoyed this video now wanted to do a quick update on Tesla 'cause we saw a massive drop in the aftermarket.
BEAR6|I explained on my previous video why that massive drop happened.
BEAR7|As you can see our high of 455 we dropped all the way down almost to our previous low yesterday which was 407 and I'm going to take that as a key resistant point for today.
BEAR8|We've been seeing massive sell offs from Tesla when it gets Rowdy and when it drops very quickly.
BEAR9|'cause this is a very volatile stock going into battery day.
NEUT10|But if we can see the trend of Tesla getting hyped up and dropping off from the scared sellers, we can kind of player moves based upon that and I'll show you the trend that I'm kind of looking on when I say things like this zero 455 is the high but we see a massive sell off almost hitting R-47 resistance but not quite there.
NEUT11|And coming back and recovering.
BEAR12|We sometimes see Tesla recovered just as fast as it drops, and now we'll go to the five day chart and we'll kind of see what is going on with Tesla now we had a peak in a high of 461 and then we dropped all the way back down to 410, which I'm putting, you know, 474 ten the resistance, and we peak back-up dropped really quick from scared sellers from that tweet from Elon Musk.
NEUT13|And now we're coming back up and then dropped again and now.
NEUT14|Do we come back up from the peak of Battery Day and then announcements?
NEUT15|Or does the battery day fail and as the stock drop again massively, that's something that I'm going to be looking at what I am playing it is.
NEUT16|I think it will have a massive peak because people will see really the reality of Tesla and how their future growth is going to be substantial and why the company is valued where it's valued at.
NEUT17|If you guys enjoyed this video.
NEUT18|Are found any of this to be useful to you?
BEAR19|Please drop that thumbs up.
NEUT20|Here's the tweets that we saw that made this stock plummet, but going into Battery day, I feel very confident we got about 3 hours until we hear the big announcements.
BULL21|I hope you guys have a great rest of your day.
