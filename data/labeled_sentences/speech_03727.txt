NEUT0|"""What are your high risk ideas for our viewers today?"
BEAR1|First one, which I'm suggesting is asylum Access Bank, now private sector banks have been known as struggling, you know, quite evidently you've seen many of the private sector banks.
NEUT2|You know, taking resistance at their mid term, moving averages and feeling to crossover that Axis Bank is one of the stocks in the same category.
NEUT3|Would suggest to sell on the stock is formed a fresh swing low for itself, so cell with the target of 650 stop us could be kept at 704 II stock, which I'm suggesting is a cell on SBI.
NEUT4|In fact on Thursday.
NEUT5|This week on the same show, and I know Reddit are salon SPI.
BEAR6|Expecting the stock would break below that 350 mark.
BEAR7|I think it's very near towards breaking that 350 levels today and I would expect some minor more downward drift into the stock price for the soda failure of the stock breaking passed above its 50 day moving average is acting as a major hurdle and assistance for SPI.
BULL8|Keeping that in you know regards, I would expect that the stock would correct to at least three, 3336 to 342 range over the near term, so cell with the target of.
BULL9|Approximately 330-6342 range and stop loss could be trained to 357 on SPI.
NEUT10|Indicator of the mood in the markets canal.
NEUT11|Both of your calls.
NEUT12|Today I sell calls.
NEUT13|Let's not go over to video Chopra, the Managing Director and CEO of Enoch Adventures.
BULL14|Thanks so much for joining us and good morning to you over there just to get a sense from you.
NEUT15|I think a lot of people say that bouts of selling provide a good opportunity for long term investors.
NEUT16|Would you however say that it's a?
NEUT17|Pragmatic approach to just wait till the dust settles till we know the extent of this second wave before you jump into a few strategic names and what you picks for our viewers today.
NEUT18|You know that corrections are a part of the bull market and we are in a long term bull run and there is no two thoughts about it, and I think that you know this sudden increase in the covid cases and you know primarily we have this concentrated.
BULL19|Surge in the covid cases.
NEUT20|About 60% of the national cases are coming from Mara strongly, so I think that you know the Indian think tank needs to get into action.
NEUT21|The central government along with the 3rd to state government should take very stringent steps to control it.
BULL22|Now we have the vaccine at hand also, which was not the case earlier, so there is definitely some respect.
NEUT23|So I think that you know market.
NEUT24|At times it exaggerates the fear, and it exaggerates the celebration also.
NEUT25|So it's it's a pendulum like movement in the market, so I would say that this too shall pass.
BULL26|And definitely as you said, the dust would settle and I would not be worried if the markets do not breach the March low of 14,262 seventy or so.
BULL27|If it all it is not breached and the markets rebound from there, I think that I would be very compatible and we would start buying.
NEUT28|But as of now you're asking me that what would be or?
NEUT29|Your pick in today's market.
NEUT30|I would you know, prefer to stay conservative and be with it.
NEUT31|Companies you know, and I think that I'd sealtech trading at 1010.
NEUT32|So, but it looks good for a target of 1100 and my second recommendation would be the Pro which is trading at 4:25.
NEUT33|"It could be bought for a target of 450."""
