BEAR0|"""Thanks sorry Facebook."
NEUT1|Facebook is from July 1st on right.
NEUT2|Really the end of June on that was a 47 and 50% move.
BEAR3|Huge move not supported by volume, right?
NEUT4|So it's giving it back quick.
BEAR5|Still gotta get down at 234 level.
BULL6|This is a good volume node here.
NEUT7|This should produce some sort of balance.
BEAR8|You've also got the oversold level here.
BEAR9|Flows are going the wrong direction.
NEUT10|They need to bounce here for bulls.
NEUT11|Bears want to see this go.
BEAR12|Negative and maybe on some sort of momentum bounce here.
BEAR13|This continues to go negative.
NEUT14|That's what bears want.
BEAR15|I think the 263 level was left behind last week.
NEUT16|Real clear level on a daily that's going to be even clearer on the on the shorter timeframes you've got.
NEUT17|All these below, here, and really below 225 level right.
NEUT18|230 level there you're going to see some selling creep and then you zoom out further.
NEUT19|You have 175 to see the one 9187 level.
NEUT20|That's where your long term trends.
NEUT21|Really come into play where people want this.
NEUT22|I don't want this so this this area appeared being rejected so significantly and not accepted is is noteworthy, right?
NEUT23|So when I'm looking at a bigger top?
NEUT24|Perspective bulls don't want to leave this behind, right?
NEUT25|They want to get back up in here and test this volume profile.
NEUT26|If that doesn't happen significant.
BEAR27|So keep your eye on that, but since we're way down here in momentum could bounce.
BULL28|Could definitely bounce like.
NEUT29|See you when we get down there.
BULL30|"You're going to get some some buyers right?"""
