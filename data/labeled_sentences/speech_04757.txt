BULL0|"""He says I don't expect Berkshire to outperform the S&P 500 during good times."
NEUT1|However, I remain a long term investor because of the huge war chest that can be deployed during the downturns in the market.
BULL2|Like we're seeing right now, Warren has been brilliant at negotiating mutually favorable deals with companies that have somewhat urgent capital needs during these downtimes, these opportunities may only come about once a decade.
NEUT3|There's a small window of time for these deals.
NEUT4|They all come at once and you don't really know if you're at the bottom of the market when the deals start coming.
NEUT5|Well, Berkshire, be able to continue this approach when Warren and Charlie are no longer at the house.
NEUT6|I I fundamentally without warning Charlie at the helm, I don't see the culture of Berkshire changing.
NEUT7|I don't see RBJ which a large part of that is.
NEUT8|Having the business acumen to understand the transaction, the economic prospects, and then the ability, the ability to act quickly.
NEUT9|I really don't see that changing as we evolve.
BULL10|Listen, you know, there's no one better than Warren and Charlie, but equally, we've got a talented team in Berkshire, both at the Berkshire level, an within our managers that can obviously look at opportunities to very quickly.
NEUT11|But you know, the reality is it's a huge.
NEUT12|Advantage we have right now when we would clearly want to be in a position to maintain that that that position of strength weren't.
NEUT13|Yeah, we will maintain it an.
NEUT14|And we not only have it.
NEUT15|With the managers of the in some cases, not all cases by a long shot, but in some cases we have managers that will occasionally come up with something that.
NEUT16|Can be quite attractive but between.
NEUT17|Greg.
NEUT18|And Todd.
NEUT19|And Ted.
NEUT20|We've got three extraordinary goodbye.
NEUT21|In terms of allocating capital and an.
NEUT22|Ha.
NEUT23|You know, I Charlie may get it, then we make an occasional column 'cause of someone we knew 20 years ago or something, but they know a lot more people.
NEUT24|They've got a lot more energy.
NEUT25|And their minds work the same way as ours.
BULL26|Have in the past so I. I think it could very well be a significant improvement when.
NEUT27|The three of them are thinking about capital allocation, then one.
NEUT28|"Charlie and I are now in particular, these found zoom."""
