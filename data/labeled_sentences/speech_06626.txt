NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|I'm Celina, Nicholas technical analyst at xm.com.
NEUT2|Today is Monday, February 20th and will look at Euro USD on the daily chart.
BEAR3|So Euro USD has a bias to the downside after the fall from one point zero 828.
BEAR4|It was the peak of February 2nd.
BULL5|For now there is strong support provided by the 50 day moving average which is close to the key 1.06 level.
BEAR6|Should this level fail to hold a support than last week's Love 1.05 twenty.
NEUT7|Will be the next support level.
BEAR8|Before reaching a multi year low of 1.03 thirty nine.
NEUT9|By reaching this level, the up leg from 1.033921 point zero 828 will be fully retraced.
NEUT10|An we could say that a short term top isn't place at this peak of 1.0 eight 28.
BEAR11|In the near term, though, downside momentum appears to be weak, we can see that RSI is just below 50, but close to it.
NEUT12|It's not really showing any direction right now, so perhaps this indicates that should downside movement occur in the short term it would be contained, and so will look at resistance levels.
BEAR13|For now it's 1.07 furney upside moves.
NEUT14|That's another key level, should the.
NEUT15|Price break above this level.
BULL16|The February 2nd high comes into view as a key resistance.
NEUT17|1.828 An if any upside moves from here, continue would see that the 200 day moving average will act as another resistance level.
BULL18|Overall, the short end and the medium term bias is looking bearish, but immediate term.
NEUT19|Is neutral for now between 1.06 and 1.07.
BULL20|Thank you so much for watching.
BULL21|"Have a great day."""
