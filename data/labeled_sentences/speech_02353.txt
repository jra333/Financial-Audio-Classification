BEAR2|This one has been in the news along with V IAC as it's been on a pretty remarkable decline.
NEUT3|If you read the news the explanation will be there, but what we're going to do is just look at some technical numbers.
NEUT4|The first area that we want to watch hold as our support is certainly going to be right around that 34.
BULL5|60 and from there this resistance, which I have as a pivot as an old, support roughly around 43, is going to be a key number to break above and hopefully regain support.
NEUT6|If we can do that in the short term, it would be ideal to get right back to around that $50 mark.
NEUT7|Now we may dip back down and slowly go back up.
BEAR8|As you can see, when we did have this big drop with this lower Wick here.
BULL9|That tells me, you know, as it dipped, people started buying an yesterday was a little bit more of a consolidating day, so that's good to see the fact that after this big drop when we do have some buyers at the bottom, we do have some possible consolidation here.
BULL10|Still, not obviously ideal if we could hang in this range and consolidate for a little bit.
BULL11|There's a good chance we can go back up.
NEUT12|There are a few gaps above, however billions and billions of dollars have come out of this, so to go back to the top seems.
NEUT13|Not impossible, but definitely a long shot from right now, so that's why let's take small steps.
BULL14|We want to see that roughly $35 hold as our ultimate support.
NEUT15|Ours are absolute bottom and then in the short term we want to break above and hold 43 as our new support.
BULL16|And then ideally if we can get back into that almost 50 to $60.00 range, that will be a little bit more of the short term goal to see if this will hopefully recover with that.
