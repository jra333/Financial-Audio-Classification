BEAR0|"""It's time now for our weekly look at what is happening in the world of factors value funds looking promising heading into 2019, but a strong first quarter has muted interest in value stocks hit."
NEUT1|Update us on that Frank to trade and what it's going to look like.
NEUT2|This year is Tom Sarah Vegas of Bloomberg intelligence.
NEUT3|Tom how is the let's talk about value versus growth.
NEUT4|These are kind of two of the bigger kind of elements within the factor world in terms of the way you screen stocks.
NEUT5|Talk to me about what's going on in the relationship, sure, so it's been really tough for value for awhile, but it's been like.
NEUT6|Basically, almost on 10 years since the financial crisis of underperformance, if you Fast forward just to the fourth quarter of last year, it was looking really good for value.
BULL7|It was doing really well overgrowth.
BULL8|Ton of money was piling into it, so it's looking really good for 2019.
NEUT9|Fast forward to the first quarter.
NEUT10|Now all basically all the outperformance, then the fourth quarter completely came back rights.
NEUT11|Given all that up, this is sort of a trade that seems to can't catch on, right?
NEUT12|It seems like every year this is going to be here for value and when it does it starts doing well.
NEUT13|It's sort of just falls over so this year is not looking too good for value.
BULL14|When I thought it would be looking a lot better.
NEUT15|How about on the asset flow fronts Tom?
NEUT16|What are investors doing?
NEUT17|Are they leaving value for growth?
NEUT18|Sure, so I will see what will real, what real dollars are doing right and even though values underperforming looks to see if investors are actually still believing in value.
NEUT19|But if you actually look at flows over the last three months, Valley, especially the last two months value, is the only factor that has had outflows.
BEAR20|Everything it's been full on inflows for all the other factors, momentum quality low, Vol.
NEUT21|Specially, but values just not being bought.
NEUT22|No ones really having it right now.
NEUT23|In terms of what happens next, kind of walk me through kind of what the other factors are looking like where we are seeing kind of interest right now, sure sure, so I would put value in like the defensive bucket.
NEUT24|So I put lowball with that with quality.
NEUT25|There is demand for defensive factor, so low Vol is taking in money quality but value isn't and one thing they remember with value is there's a lot of financial exposures to it, right?
NEUT26|Financials just are not in Vogue right now, so you gotta remember that financials just tend to have a pretty high waiting financial so those tend to be shunned.
NEUT27|But there is, there is demand for defensive factor, especially love all that's leading the way.
NEUT28|"This year for flows."""
