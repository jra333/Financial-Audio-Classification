NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this news who planned the man is talking alloces and this time for Activision Blizzard ticker ATVI."
BEAR1|We are expecting a bearish correction or retracement on this stock.
NEUT2|This is the trading disclaimer you composed the video and read it at anytime, OK?
NEUT3|Probably you will belong on Activision Blazer.
NEUT4|If you are looking at these more time frames like why now we're intraday or trading or 4 hour within 30 minutes or 15 minutes.
NEUT5|Or maybe you are now short on the way down, but I will as a long term trade in.
BULL6|We have a very strong mountain balance there.
NEUT7|To which we are expecting price to draw, maybe will not.
NEUT8|It will stay over there and then like at the middle here 50% replacement then rally again.
NEUT9|We don't know that bad things we are.
NEUT10|Trading imbalances are supply as a supply demand trader and must wait for their retracement.
BEAR11|If you are a breakout trader, you are losing on this one.
BEAR12|You probably have lossed on your choice.
NEUT13|Unless you are buying long term as you don't care about these corrections.
BEAR14|OK, but it is not a good idea is never a good idea to buy after such a strong rally.
NEUT15|Believing that you are missing the train 'cause most of the time you want.
NEUT16|Sometimes some stores will continue to rally, but then it will eventually they will trace that sometime in the future they will reach way.
NEUT17|So you better focus on those are our.
NEUT18|Getting near closer to these imbalances, but obviously if you are looking at the smaller time frames you are not going to know what's going on in the markets because you won't be seeing the bigger picture.
NEUT19|So in the middle of the screen we can read about the specifics about the stock.
NEUT20|This is a ticker at the ATVI.
NEUT21|1M stands for the multi timeframe, so every single candle stick represent amount of time.
BULL22|So super strong balance down there.
NEUT23|If price drops on there, it is a good idea to go along right now.
NEUT24|Going along is not a good idea.
NEUT25|The mouth is in the middle of a correction, so buying is not aware.
NEUT26|Yeah, maybe if you are an intraday trader short term trader you can go short on the way down using bearish option strategies or.
NEUT27|Whatever you're using to sell or place a trade with a bearish bias.
NEUT28|For this stock, as you can see, I have not added any indicator or oscillator.
NEUT29|No news announcements, no fundamental analysis are don't care what these gaming companies doing what GNU Game Day, largest launch or if they had a bad quarter last, second or third quarter earnings were not that good enough.
NEUT30|I don't care about that, I just care about where these imbalances are created.
NEUT31|You want to add more layers of complexity.
NEUT32|You're welcome my friend up to you, I'm not.
NEUT33|Remember that this is a single time frame analysis for Activision Blizzard and a single time frame is not enough to make a training decision.
