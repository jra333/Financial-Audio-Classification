BULL0|"""Hey everyone, and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So if you ever need to my channel appreciate yes and drop alive.
NEUT2|Subscribe you guys find this very informative.
NEUT3|He has learned something new.
BULL4|So basically I want to talk about Netflix and the reason why is because Netflix has been increasing a lot for the past couple of days.
NEUT5|OK it used to be in the 300,400's OK. And let me show you something very interesting.
NEUT6|So we go for the past five years.
BULL7|We can see how Netflix has been increasing a lot.
BULL8|You know, it was like in the $88.00 like $80.00 in the past five years, how much their stock was worth now if we look at this, you know it started increasing.
NEUT9|And one thing that I notice?
NEUT10|OK, maybe this is just me, but you know, you can do your whole information.
NEUT11|Basically look at 2018 June that's running summer right?
NEUT12|It hit all high of, literally like.
BEAR13|424 hundred, $11.00 right and then you know, started decreasing and they dropped OK to like 243 and then you know it's going on going on blah blah blah.
NEUT14|And then it's summer again right July in 380 and then it dropped again and then you know we're here and right now it's April 24th and right now it's at a all time high.
NEUT15|Is $422 OK so from the past I'm looking at this pattern that.
BULL16|Their stock OK increases during summer.
NEUT17|What is the increase during summer?
BEAR18|And this is just my opinion and I truly believe that it's because they drop many good shows during summer, not now that.
NEUT19|Right now everyone said quarantine everyone's at home, just watching TV.
NEUT20|Being with family.
BEAR21|A lot of people have a lot of time now, and I'm pretty sure they're they're going to be dropping a lot of good shows.
NEUT22|You know, for everyone to just be at home and enjoy them.
BULL23|And I truly believe that the stock market for Netflix will increase to $500 during summer.
NEUT24|And if it doesn't, probably till the end of the year.
NEUT25|But once again, I'm seeing this pattern once you know, summer is kind of over, you know, just drops once again.
BEAR26|Like last year, you know in the summer it's increasing and then it just drops and then you know.
NEUT27|But I don't know I might be wrong.
NEUT28|Let me know.
NEUT29|Down in the comments section below.
NEUT30|What do you guys think about Netflix?
NEUT31|Is it a good company to buy?
NEUT32|Is that one of those strong stocks or is it one of those songs that you know that just boosts up for a moment and then they just drop randomly?
BULL33|I hope you guys enjoyed it.
NEUT34|Give it, give me.

BULL36|Hope you guys enjoy.
