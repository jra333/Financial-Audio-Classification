NEUT0|"""Time now for the Sozzi sizzle."
NEUT1|Looking at retail and consumer names and with editor at large Brian Sozzi.
NEUT2|Alright, Brian, help me out with what's going on with the Kraft Heinz.
NEUT3|We're going back to talking about Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway here.
BEAR4|I'm looking at consumer Staples XL Pycraft again the worst performer stock down here 2%.
NEUT5|That's a lot better when you're when you're off 2730% or whatever.
NEUT6|You know we had last week, so Warren Buffett coming out and saying that he likely overpaid for Kraft, but he's not going to pull the plug on it.
NEUT7|What are we to make of?
NEUT8|His position here.
NEUT9|Well maybe he should because in all for all intents and purposes this is dead money and I got.
NEUT10|I brought a couple of reasons down look.
NEUT11|Maxwell House reportedly might be trying to be shocked by the Kraft Heinz people for $3.3 billion.
NEUT12|But who is the buyer for that asset?
NEUT13|When was the last time we drank Maxwell House?
NEUT14|We have curing all sorts of different options.
BEAR15|You have an explosion in the pre packaged coffee section in grocery stores.
NEUT16|Maximalism House is not playing in this, but you will probably see it will be hard to ultimately spinoff these businesses.
BEAR17|The market is looking for spinoffs.
BEAR18|The bad results are going to continue.
NEUT19|What the company put forth in the fourth quarter.
NEUT20|There is no reason to think results will turn around.
BEAR21|That put pressure on the stock and then Lastly management trusts have buffet really looks for management trust.
NEUT22|He puts a lot of trust in managers.
BEAR23|How can you trust the management team after this type of quarter and massive write down?
NEUT24|You just can't.
NEUT25|And you guys these brands are so tired.
NEUT26|I mean on the one hand, they're facing competition for a lower priced generics and let me just read some of these.
NEUT27|In the other hand, like they're just so unhealthy, get their health.
NEUT28|Is macaroni and cheese Hines Velveeta or Ida Kool-aid jello?
NEUT29|Oscar Mayer Lunchables Capri Sun, but we've always known that Berkshire Hathaway has been in not the healthiest foods, right?
NEUT30|This isn't sure.
NEUT31|Yeah, but but but the wind is stronger in their face, right?
NEUT32|Is stronger finally going to be catching up with them?
NEUT33|I guess on a in a way.
NEUT34|Like see what you did there?
NEUT35|Catch up, yeah yeah no.
NEUT36|I think sozzi you know think about this I saw a few people make this comment over the weekend, especially after yesterday's report that Credit Suisse had been hired to shop the Maxwell House asset.
NEUT37|It's like I thought 3G could do it all themselves, right?
NEUT38|So now they're hiring a banker to sell, you know, basically, a flagging coffee brand and they're looking for seven plus times EBITDA.
NEUT39|I mean, that's an expensive PE deal, but I don't know what P managers out there.
NEUT40|And I know those guys always have a lot of dry powder.
BEAR41|Or someone might pay.
NEUT42|That kind of valuation, but they're doing $400 million in even a year.
NEUT43|They want more than 3 billion for that, but 3G's already been in there, cutting out every cost known to man.
NEUT44|So what's how are you going to get 7 times for the files of this thing goes for $3 billion mackles I will buy you lunch at your organic restaurant choice with a lunchable with a launchable alone.
NEUT45|It's just not gonna happen way excessive, so I guess what is it because Buffett is now come out and said we don't pull the plug.
NEUT46|It isn't our style.
NEUT47|To me it's like doesn't matter.
NEUT48|You're stuck with cut your losses wave goodbye.
BULL49|You're trying to tell, maybe buy some more Coca Cola because unlike Kraft Heinz, Coca Cola is showing that it can reinvent its brands.
BEAR50|Today they dropped Orange Coca Cola.
BULL51|A lot of innovation in smaller cans, a lot of product innovation around the globe.
NEUT52|They're doing everything that Kraft Heinz is not.
NEUT53|And they've been there for awhile.
NEUT54|I mean, it's not like 3G just walked in the door, right?
NEUT55|I mean, it's been awhile.
NEUT56|They cut the costs, but you're right, mostly like the innovation stuff.
BEAR57|It's all been cost cutting.
NEUT58|I don't see any new SK use innovation with packaging or different brands.
NEUT59|Spinoff healthier stuff.
NEUT60|"If only someone had the opportunity to ask Warren Buffett more about this latest, they will, you know will have to say."""
