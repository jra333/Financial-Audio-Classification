NEUT0|"""Aside from financials in terms of individual stocks, what do you have your eyes on?"
NEUT1|Well yeah.
BULL2|19 thanks Chris for that.
NEUT3|I think one that I think is just set up to do well and again it's on a much larger sizes Alphabet.
NEUT4|The Google parent business.
NEUT5|Just when you think about all that they are in.
NEUT6|And where they are taking that business, obviously search continues search and advertising online advertising continues to be the huge driver, but they're involved in so many other investments they're making.
NEUT7|It's about $750 billion business.
NEUT8|They have about $100 billion in cash.
NEUT9|They're making all kinds of investments there.
BULL10|YouTube business continues to grow, and I think it's probably more profitable than than what we're seeing.
NEUT11|Online.
NEUT12|Advertising will continue to evolve and grow.
NEUT13|Obviously it's a company that size has some struggles when it comes to regulatory concerns.
NEUT14|The online advertising market, while it's evolving, is under some pressure as we saw with the likes of Facebook.
NEUT15|When it comes to privacy issues and what that might mean for the average online advertising business.
NEUT16|But I just like what is it going on at Alphabet with the way they've structured that business with Google and the other businesses and investments they're making in other businesses, and the stock is really not that expensive, so it's one that I like now.
NEUT17|On the financial side, picking back back to the financial 1A non bank that I like is market access, which operates the largest online bond trading platform in the it's not ****.
NEUT18|It is well sorry you know with the with.
NEUT19|They're basically trying to democratize and open up bond trading, much like you've seen in with with.
NEUT20|Platforms and discount brokerages on the stock side is much more complex.
NEUT21|It's much more done.
NEUT22|Old school through phones or text messages or emails when you're trying to match up buyers and sellers of of corporate bonds and sovereign bonds, and lots of other fixed instrument investments and their market leader, the largest market share when it comes to online bond trading, that's a growing market.
NEUT23|They are led by their by their founder and CEO's and largest individual share owner.
NEUT24|Richmond VE I.
BULL25|Extremely profitable, it returns on capital are exceptional.
BULL26|They're growing, and I expect that market to continue to evolve and improve over the next few years, and so market access is 1 stock that I like this year and beyond just to go back to Alphabet for a second.
BEAR27|Obviously the Fang stocks have dominated media coverage for so long.
NEUT28|Yes, it is interesting to see with the pullback that we saw over the last couple of months a company like Amazon which is.
BEAR29|Still, even with you know the focus is on well, they're down from their highs.
BULL30|Well they are, but over the past 12 months it's a stock that's still up about 30%, whereas in the case of Alphabet I mean alphabets, basically flat from a year ago.
NEUT31|This talk really has.
NEUT32|It's just basically kind of treading water here a little bit.
NEUT33|And that's one reason why it sells.
NEUT34|You know that somewhere in the 1518 times earnings, when you think about the amount of cash flow generation where they can put those investments into now they have to make money on those investments over the long term.
NEUT35|And I think they will.
NEUT36|So I think that's the kind of company you can.
NEUT37|Again, it's a very large large company and it's widely owned, but I think that's a business that you can you can own and be comfortable with me.
NEUT38|"Look at the next few years regardless of what's going to happen to the stock market in the short term."""
