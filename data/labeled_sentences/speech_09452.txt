BULL0|"""Welcome back, shares of space companies rocketing today."
NEUT1|Kathy was Arc invest planning to add a space exploration ETF under the ticker ARKX.
BULL2|That's according to a new SEC filing it's boosting shares of Virgin Galactic and Maxar Technologies.
BULL3|Virgins up 19% right now, Max ours, up 21%.
NEUT4|Also, satellite operators like bias at an eridium.
BULL5|We're seeing some big moves as well.
BEAR6|Even two specs are spiking on this today.
NEUT7|Stable Rd acquisition, which is merging with momentous which is developing last mile in space transportation.
NEUT8|Systems and New Providence acquisition, which is taking broadband satellite startup AST and science public.
NEUT9|You can see some pretty big moves there, but it's not the only space news of the day either because we have one name that investors shouldn't expect to see in public markets anytime soon, but is watched very closely.
NEUT10|And that is Jeff Bezos, blue origin.
NEUT11|It just conducted a flawless test launch earlier today.
BULL12|Blue Origin sending upgraded version of its suborbital New Shepard capsule and rocket to the edge of space from West TX.
NEUT13|You can see that video right there on your screen.
NEUT14|About two hours ago was a trip that lasted about 10 minutes.
NEUT15|The reusable system built to carry space tourists went about 62 miles above Earth.
NEUT16|So just above the Karman line, an back closer to finally doing just that.
NEUT17|With space tourists that's eventually going to happen.
NEUT18|It's the 14th flight for Blue Origin an onboard.
NEUT19|Today we had a dummy mannequin named Mannequin, Skywalker and more than 50,000 postcards from kids.
NEUT20|Josh just isn't it.
NEUT21|So cool.
NEUT22|It really is and I like.
NEUT23|I like the fact that so many people are excited about this Anet cyantific.
NEUT24|It's not science fiction so it's like I like that there's this growing interest in the markets to an look what's going on with these space stocks.
NEUT25|So this is very reminiscent.
NEUT26|I was around.
NEUT27|Believe it or not, when the Internet first became a Wall Street topic in 98, there were only five companies that you could buy if you wanted to.
NEUT28|So every day you came to work and you just bought all five Amazon eBay Legos.
NEUT29|Excite Yahoo.
NEUT30|I think with the names, so there's like five or six publicly traded space plays.
BEAR31|They're all up huge because everyones frontrunning Kathy Woods show launch.
NEUT32|The ETF shall raise billions of dollars.
NEUT33|Yeah, she'll put it to work.
NEUT34|She doesn't have that many companies to choose from, so the market is not being entirely irrational here I feel like we're at the point where if she said she was about to invest in egg salad, people would start buying chickens like that's like that's what's going on right now.
NEUT35|Won't last forever.
BULL36|She's totally having a moment and I like it.
NEUT37|It's.
NEUT38|Cool to see.
NEUT39|"Yeah, and of course writing Gangbuster returns for those funds, let's let's do Andrew Shell."""
