NEUT0|"""So David Visa and MasterCard, two of the hottest financial stocks."
NEUT1|If investors are out there looking looking at these longingly, which is your pick?
NEUT2|Which is the better buy?
NEUT3|If I had to buy one?
NEUT4|So I'm not necessarily rushing out to buy it today, I would go with MasterCard.
NEUT5|Well we let's start then with you start.
NEUT6|If I had to buy one, so why wouldn't you buy one?
NEUT7|Let's go there.
NEUT8|You and I were both kind of.
NEUT9|We're kind of value guys.
NEUT10|We like stuff that people don't like necessarily.
NEUT11|When I look at Visa and MasterCard.
BULL12|There is so much optimism around these two companies.
NEUT13|Everyone looks at these companies and say they basically have a duopoly on the industry which is true, and everyone saying we're still in a very cash focused society as a whole in the global economy.
BULL14|And that's going to move towards electronic payments, and these are going to benefit.
NEUT15|So everyone's got this simple thesis, and it's basically everyone assuming it's a foregone conclusion.
NEUT16|That's going to happen that these two companies are continued to dominate the world, and there's just so much optimism an I can't help.
NEUT17|That makes me a little nervous.
NEUT18|What do you think?
NEUT19|Well, I agree, and you know it's.
BEAR20|Painful to me that I haven't purchased Visa or MasterCard to date because they've performed so well an it is that it's that simple thesis though, which is it's been there the whole time and people have known it the whole time, and so maybe some people have been staying away for that reason that they think there's been too much optimism.
NEUT21|Maybe it's like me where I've looked at both of these stocks all on the line and continued to say, and it's just a little too expensive.
NEUT22|It's a little too expensive, so I mean, even today I look at Visa forward earnings, multiple of 22 MasterCard.
BULL23|Forward earnings multiple of about 21, but the drivers are really still there here in the USI was looking at some numbers about 27% of transactions in 2012 took place with cash, so that's not huge, but there's still room for growth there.
NEUT24|But globally one of our fellow fools, Jason Moser, was telling me this it was from he was saying was from a MasterCard presentation that 85% of transactions globally still take place with cash.
NEUT25|I mean, when you think about the opportunity there for the.
NEUT26|Leaders in this industry, it's huge.
NEUT27|So I'm trying to wrap my head around the two of a man, get myself to buy because I still see a lot of growth opportunity ahead.
NEUT28|If I had to choose one, it would probably be MasterCard, mainly because to me it's a little bit of a toss up between the two and mastercards about half the size of visa so you can argue that there's maybe a little bit more room for growth there.
NEUT29|Yeah, that was my thinking as well, but I think it's kind of interesting if you think back to I don't know.
NEUT30|50 years ago and say you have a check and there's a company that does checks.
NEUT31|They might say man, this is.
BULL32|This is a great thing.
BULL33|It's so much better than cash.
NEUT34|Everyone kind of control their finances, but look when it comes to looking much, it's changed, yeah, well, I mean it has changed, but I mean if you look at so a particular type of check there wasn't branded companies that were doing except maybe American Express, which had the travelers checks which have been around for forever.
NEUT35|And if you look at American Express today versus 50 years ago, I mean we could be saying, you know, it could be a similar story with Visa or MasterCard over a similar time period.
NEUT36|Looking forward, right?
NEUT37|"All right moving on."""
