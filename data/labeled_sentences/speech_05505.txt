NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Saturday, February 13th and in this video I'm going to be talking about Palantir Tech ticker symbol PLTR.
BEAR2|So Palantir closed on Friday at $31.91, which was a 3.62% drop from.
NEUT3|The previous day.
NEUT4|As many of you know, we have the earnings report coming up on February 16th.
BULL5|While people have a positive outlook on the earnings report, I'm not too confident if it's going to help and the price movement.
BEAR6|If you look here at the daily chart you could see the 20 year mayline was broken.
NEUT7|And up and we close below that.
NEUT8|In terms of the next support zone I'm looking at is.
BULL9|I'm suspecting that it will catch up to this yellow line over here, which is the moving average.
NEUT10|So let me just hide it to clarify it.
NEUT11|So I think our next price target is going to be around the 2850 to the $29.00 mark which is aligned with.
BULL12|The resistance over here, so we're in the hopes of creating a support level around the previous resistance level.
NEUT13|Because we know him back in November and December, we traded sideways for awhile.
NEUT14|Until we had the breakout on January 22nd.
BEAR15|And we moved away from the 50 moving average and now it looks like it's tracing back down.
NEUT16|And we'll probably touch the 50 moving average before reaching the size of moment.
NEUT17|Are we going to form a support level here or we're going to have an additional downward movement?
NEUT18|Looking at the RSI.
BEAR19|It is looking bearish and definitely the Magdi is looking bearish.
NEUT20|We could see here the crossover between the two moving averages.
NEUT21|So there's definitely.
NEUT22|From a technical perspective, an indication of an additional downward movement.
BEAR23|And we could see here the sell off volume is getting, it's also increasing.
NEUT24|And as many of you know that in the coming week the employees will have their.
NEUT25|Stock options unlocked so they can sell if they choose to, and I'm sure many of them will cash out on the other stock options in the long term.
BEAR26|I'm very bullish on Palantir, but I think over the past month we went up too fast too soon.
NEUT27|So now we need to find a new support zone.
NEUT28|I'm probably trade sideways for a bit before the next leg up.
NEUT29|So we'll watch the price around the 2850 to 29 and see if that holds.
BULL30|If that holds, then we should see a sideway movement around this range.
NEUT31|And if that doesn't hold then.
BEAR32|We could see a trace down.
NEUT33|And probably create a support zone around the $25 mark if not less, win the $25 and the $20.
BULL34|Hope you find this video helpful, as usual.
BULL35|"Thank you all for watching and see you in the next video."""
