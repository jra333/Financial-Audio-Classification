BULL0|"""Hello Internet."
NEUT1|In this video, we'll make some educated guesses on the price of Bitcoin.
NEUT2|But before we start, let me remind that this video is not investment advice.
NEUT3|Please carry out your own research.
NEUT4|Warren Buffett once said that in the business world, the rearview mirror is always clearer than the windshield.
NEUT5|We all know the shape of Bitcoin price graph, and it doesn't say much about the future price.
BULL6|Speaking of future price, some people claim that price of Bitcoin will go up to $1,000,000.
NEUT7|We analyze this speculative allegation on our video.
NEUT8|Check it out.
NEUT9|Actually, long term investors don't attribute importance to manipulative information, so it would be rational to look into what is going on.
NEUT10|The rearview mirror, which is the past day tour of Bitcoin, as we all know, Bitcoin is not a stock, not a currency printed by governments.
NEUT11|So we have not too much data to investigate some cryptocurrency analysis to examines the Google trends search of Bitcoin.
NEUT12|It is not a novel strategy and not a new aspect.
NEUT13|However, in this video will show you some surprising correlation between price of Bitcoin and Google.
NEUT14|Search of Bitcoin here.
NEUT15|In Microsoft XL we have three columns.
NEUT16|First one, there's date column, second one is popularity of Bitcoin, and third one is price of Bitcoin.
NEUT17|Between 2012 to 2017, look at how correlated they are.
NEUT18|Price of Bitcoin in search of Bitcoin or 80% correlated as a superintelligence?
NEUT19|I will give you unknown analysis strategy through the history of Bitcoin.
NEUT20|Price always follows the popularity of Bitcoin.
NEUT21|Look at here in 2013.
NEUT22|First popularity increased and then price followed.
BULL23|It popularity rose up drastically whereas Price did not increase so much.
NEUT24|Because this was the first time people even didn't know where to buy Bitcoin.
NEUT25|Look at this between 2013 and 2014.
NEUT26|First, popularity went to Moon, then price followed.
NEUT27|As you can see, popularity is triggered before the price, but here is trick when popularity declines.
NEUT28|Price does not follow immediately.
NEUT29|Look at this section and this section.
NEUT30|Finally, let's dive in 2017.
NEUT31|Look at this harmony between price and popularity.
BEAR32|Here is the drastic uptrend of popularity.
BULL33|After that, three weeks later, price of Bitcoin reached Peak Point, which is about $3000 popularity.
BEAR34|A continuously declining price will follow as usual, and it is a superb opportunity to invest in Bitcoin when it is cheaper.
NEUT35|If you are a long term investor, do not worry.
NEUT36|Buy Bitcoin when the people do not talk about it.
NEUT37|Don't be stupid.
NEUT38|Buy cheap.
NEUT39|Please do not share this video.
