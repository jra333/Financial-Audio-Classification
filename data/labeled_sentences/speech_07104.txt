NEUT1|Kayla Tashi is actually standing by outside at the Labor Department.
BEAR2|Kayla Becky 157 thousand jobs.
BEAR3|That was the nonfarm payroll addition for the month of July.
BEAR4|I think the more important issue is that even with this, I think still very strong job numbers come back and professional hires nice strong manufacturing numbers were not getting the wage gains.
NEUT5|We like to see you never want to take one job number or one any number.
NEUT6|As a trend you want to see a lot of him, so taking an average is a better idea.
BEAR7|Now job creation is still going pretty well but has slowed compared to where it was.
BEAR8|Three years ago, so the last 18 months are slower than the 18 months before that part of that's natural 'cause we're running out of people think the averages have picked up.
BULL9|I mean, both the three month and and the six month are now above 220 K. And if you add you know something for this one off factor in Toys R Us, then I think it's very rapid payroll growth.
BEAR10|You look at the Household survey and the drop in the unemployment rate was due to very strong household employment growth.

BULL12|"So this is a firm report I think."""
