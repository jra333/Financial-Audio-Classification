BULL0|"""So I'm more optimistic than Dan Dan, by the way, is more optimistic than most of the sell side."
NEUT1|I think that I want to pick up.
NEUT2|I love dance work.
BEAR3|Want to pick up on the concept of super cycle, which undoubtedly will be one of the themes that we're going here going into 5G as a quick aside, the first year of 5G for the iPhone will be a disappointment for investors.
NEUT4|I think that ultimately it's going.
BULL5|This is a massive opportunity for Apple, a huge play on 5G, but it's going to take time for the networks to roll out coverage.
NEUT6|But I want to go back to the phrase supercycle, that to me is really the core of how most investors think.
NEUT7|Still, think largely about the Apple story.
NEUT8|Is this you kind of own it going into big cycles, and I think that is in part what is moving the stock higher.
NEUT9|But I think to answer your question where I think this can go, I think that this ultimately can be a 350 or $400 stock, and I base that on a belief that this is we're going to gravitate over the next two years.
NEUT10|Two of you, that this is more of a consumer tech staples company, growing much faster than companies like Coca Cola.
NEUT11|Doctor Gamblin should deserve a multiple closer to 25 or 30 times, and I understand that is a departure from this super cycle view over the last decade and covering Apple, but I think ultimately wearables services.
NEUT12|This whole kind of Symphony of products working together is going to influence investors to rate this higher overtime gene.
BEAR13|If the 5G iPhone super Cycle is a disappointment.
NEUT14|Arguably the 5G rollout in the US is going to be.
BEAR15|A disappointment, right?
NEUT16|I mean that that's that's the main device that a lot of people are expecting.
NEUT17|You're going to sell this network.
NEUT18|Is it that you think that Apple is not going to have the software and services ready in 2020 to entice people to buy a phone like that?
NEUT19|That that's a 2021 story.
NEUT20|I need to be clear 'cause you know the word.
NEUT21|Disappointment is a important word and I chose that wisely.
BULL22|Ultimately is that there is the stock is going to move higher next year.
BULL23|I think that this is going to be one of the best performers, if not the top tech performer next year as well.
NEUT24|So I just want to be clear about that.
BULL25|I think the hype around 5G is going to grow.
NEUT26|I also want to answer your question is that this is not an Apple related problem.
BEAR27|The disappointment is I think largely on the shoulders of the carriers who have talked.
NEUT28|I think a lot about the 75% coverage by the end of the next year.
NEUT29|I think that that is.
NEUT30|Optimistic at the best case.
NEUT31|And so as I kind of Fast forward, they'll be 5 iPhones next year.
NEUT32|I think the stock continues to move higher, but investors should have a sober view about how that first year this would be calendar 2021.
NEUT33|Largely that first year of 5G sales.
NEUT34|The good news is it's going to happen.
BULL35|We will get an incredible lift in iPhone.
BULL36|I reluctant to use the phrase super cycle, but we will get a massive lift over the next few years.
NEUT37|"It's just investors need to be patient in that first year because the coverage won't be there."""
