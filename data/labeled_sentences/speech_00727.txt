NEUT0|"""Let's get a little bit stock specific here."
NEUT1|We've seen some of those high flying techniques come under pressure today, and some of the other big names that we've been following.
BEAR2|A name like Tesla that stock off just around 2 1/2% today.
BEAR3|Elon Musk announcing a price cut for the model as it's his second one this week.
NEUT4|And Rick when you take a look at the stocks reaction to this news, I mean the street, at least.
BEAR5|Seeing this as a negative here for the company, at least in the near term, I guess.
BEAR6|So, Tesla said they're going to cut the price of the Model S and some other models.
NEUT7|Basically, it looks like there.
BEAR8|We're trying to get into competitive ballpark with this new company lucid that has a sedan coming on to the market in a few months that will compete with the Model S so Elon Musk tweeted that the new price will be just over $69,000, which will undercut the lucid sedan when when it hits the market.
NEUT9|But this is this is kind of weird in a way, Shawna.
NEUT10|I mean the way most automakers price their cars is they set a an MSRP when the thing goes on the market and nobody pays the MSRP.
NEUT11|You know, you negotiate with the dealer and usually you get it lower than the MSRP.
NEUT12|But if it's a really hot car, it's going to be higher than the MSRP, so the MSRP doesn't really mean that much.
NEUT13|For most cars, Tesla is different 'cause it doesn't really have dealers, and you know they're obviously trying to do things differently, so I guess Elon Musk wants everybody to know that Tesla will remain competitive on price with everybody out there.
BEAR14|If you know volumes don't change that, in theory that reduces your revenue by a little bit.
NEUT15|But in reality when you lower the price, sometimes you sell more cars, so I'm not sure.
BEAR16|It's a net negative for Tesla, and then they'll **** at least under pressure today after they cut prices for the second time in a week with falling just over 2%.
