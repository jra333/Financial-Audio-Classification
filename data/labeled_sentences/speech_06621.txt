BEAR0|"""Hello and welcome to this technical analysis video here at except.com is Thursday, July 19th and today we're going to look at pound dollar which continues to underperform as divisions over the Brexit plan and slower than expected inflation and retail sales readings pushed pound to fresh 10 month lows."
BEAR1|So now looking at what's happening in the daily chart, we can see that cable broke a key level at one point, 3048 on Wednesday.
BEAR2|That was the lowest level rich this year.
BEAR3|To touch a new trove of one point 2982 today, a signal that the next moving prices could come lower as well.
NEUT4|There is an empty magazine support.
BEAR5|We can see that there is size not expanding in bearish territory after failing to cross above the 50 neutral level.
BEAR6|While the market has dropped back below its red signal line.
BEAR7|So we see further weakness in the market.
BEAR8|The price could stop around 1.29 before it heads down to find support between one point 28 at one point 27.
BULL9|60 hour the price post for awhile last summer and on the other hand, chances for rebound are increasing as Versailles approaches oversold levels.
BULL10|Under this scenario, the pair could find immediate resistance at the previous low of one point 3048, while a move higher could also meet the 20 day moving average currently at one point 3189, then a little bit higher.
NEUT11|At one point, 3290 day moving average could be some of the challenge because.
BEAR12|But we have seen prices reversing lower ones touching this line in the past two weeks.
BULL13|Further up the market could confirm the start of an option if it manages to close above Jones high of one point 3471.
NEUT14|Finally turning to the medium term picture.
BEAR15|The bearish outlook has deteriorated as pound dollar continues to deviate below one point 3650 threshold for the market to return back to neutrality.
NEUT16|So that's all from him.
NEUT17|Thank you for watching.
BULL18|"Have a great day."""
