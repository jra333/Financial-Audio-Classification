BULL0|"""Hey silent investors and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about Nano Dimension.
NEUT2|Main reason why is because this thought can potentially double and possibly even reach $20 OK. And the reason why this stock has been growing up is because there's a lot of customers right now that they're actually investing in.
NEUT3|Buying a lot of things from this company before we continue guys, we will not.
NEUT4|We partner up and we're literally giving you 4 free stocks.
NEUT5|That's right, we would still doing the promotion where you have four free stocks.
NEUT6|All you have to do is use my link down inscription below.
NEUT7|Sign up deposit $100.
NEUT8|Get 4 free stocks.
NEUT9|Not only that, but I'm giving away $50 to a random person.
NEUT10|These are the free stocks that I've been getting and I want to give back to one of you guys as she signs up and takes the courage to do so.
NEUT11|I gotta Apple stock guys look.
NEUT12|I literally got three songs that are worth $100 so guys do not miss out on this great opportunity.
NEUT13|So what is going on with Nano dimension?
NEUT14|A lot of news because I don't know.
NEUT15|You know.
BEAR16|2021 stocks are kind of flat.
NEUT17|You know there are some stocks going up here and there.
NEUT18|When it comes to like electrical vehicle stocks, you know Tesla's, the one that really it's going up.
NEUT19|The other ones are kind of saying flat big songs like Adobe, you know, kind of dropping.
NEUT20|But when it comes to Nano dimension starting the year, it's not looking really good.
NEUT21|So you can see from the.
BEAR22|Since you know the beginning of the year now dimension has been dropping OK, I already went down like around 1520%, and the question is, should you invest especially right now that it's dropping?
NEUT23|Or should you wait or just you know, if you want to buy the dip so?
NEUT24|What do you need to understand is not dimension was actually really low.
NEUT25|It was one of those penny stocks that I was talking about.
NEUT26|If you guys go back to the penny stock videos I was making, you guys will see that Nano Dimension is mentioned here.
NEUT27|So I was talking about it but I didn't put a lot of attention to it because once again a penny stock.
NEUT28|It's a penny stock supposed to.
NEUT29|It supposed to stand for penny stocks, but sometimes some stocks to go up but nano dimension yes can see it continued to just go up and up.
NEUT30|He hasn't seen this huge increase, you know from.
NEUT31|I would say from October or even November just started going up so fast.
NEUT32|OK so one thing I need to understand is why is it going up?
BULL33|So if you guys don't know in December it almost went up 50% OK, absolutely crazy.
BULL34|You know they ended the year pretty strong right?
BULL35|So the record 4 is definitely going to show some good news.
NEUT36|Some share some dimension.
BULL37|It went up around 42% in December.
NEUT38|OK, and one of the reasons why is because there was a lot of customers that that they basically put a lot of orders and they upgraded to the Dragonfly 3D printing machine.
NEUT39|So yes or no, they do 3D printing printing machines.
NEUT40|You guys are familiar with that.
BULL41|I myself I've been wanting to own one, you know, do some cool stuff but a lot of people have been, you know, upgrading to it and because of that that's the main reason why nano dimension went up almost 50% in December.
NEUT42|Absolutely crazy yes, and see that it's.
NEUT43|It's insane how this stock just started going up in December.
NEUT44|Yes, and seen on the Metra, gave an update of its business in a press release published on December 4th and then from there you know it just started going up.
BEAR45|The company revealed that 10 customers have upgraded to its new 24/7 Dragonfly LDM machines in 2020, so a lot of things going on, but from the looks of it right now, the stock is dropping, so I think it's best to wait for the dip, but let me know down in the comments section below.
BULL46|Investing Nano Dimension will continue to go up in 2021.
NEUT47|Or will you know, drop once again, we've seen it in the past.
NEUT48|How none of the mentioned was really hard back in 2016 and then literally dropped to a penny stock and slowly right now going back up.
NEUT49|But I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT50|If you do give it a big thumbs up.
NEUT51|"Let me know down in the comments section below and I will see you guys on my next video."""
