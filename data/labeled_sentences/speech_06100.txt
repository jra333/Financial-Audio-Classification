NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|Amazon will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a rough day for Amazon, but it was a rough day for pretty much the tech stocks here.
NEUT5|Started off with the gap down and then a false bounce to the upside and then it was pretty much bearishness all the way to the closing Bell hair.
NEUT6|But there is definitely level here that.
NEUT7|Stands out quite a bit and a lot.
NEUT8|A lot of people are going to be watching this area right down here at 3120 and this is not some sort of great discovery on my part, so I'm not trying to come across like this is some sort of special skill.
NEUT9|The exact opposite, I assure you.
NEUT10|People that use charts understand charts have taken notice of this level, and they're going to be watching that area.
NEUT11|And I bring all that up because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy covered.
NEUT12|If you want it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT13|And then again that is exactly what we have.
NEUT14|This area right here.
NEUT15|I mean, you go through the history of things.
BULL16|And you can see it's done a fantastic job of behaving as support whenever the price is gotten down around it.
BEAR17|So my point here is that you know no such thing as a guarantee, but if the price does breakdown below that level, that could very well create quite a bit of downward selling pressure and drive the price at least down to that pink line there, which is that 200.
BEAR18|Moving average currently around the 3089 mark, so keep that in mind because like I said, now, to be fair, I mean the prices bounced off that level, so who knows, maybe the price is going to snap back upwards, but like I said, if the price does breakdown below that area, I would expect some more selling pressure to step in.
NEUT19|Now, on the flip side, like I said, maybe the price bounces and if there is any sort of attempted bounced back to the upside.
NEUT20|Key level resistance to watch is going to be the purple line there.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|Simple moving average current value of that right up there around 3175.
BULL23|So yeah, rough day today.
NEUT24|And yeah, the chart is now sitting at a very very interesting level moving forward.
NEUT25|So keep an eye on that.
NEUT26|And let's see if the price ultimately breaks down through there or if it can create another bounce again.
NEUT27|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live.
NEUT29|Revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT37|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT38|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot.
NEUT39|Which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT40|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT41|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
