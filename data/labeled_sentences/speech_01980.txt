NEUT0|"""Put bluntly, because Mssi is the first the index providers included Hong Kong in US listed Chinese stocks, such as Tencent and Alibaba, for awhile, but including domestic or a shares means investors who track its flagship Emerging Markets Index can no longer avoid getting to grips with those mainland stocks."
NEUT1|Other index providers already offer investors a parallel universe choice with their benchmark indices in two forms, one with a shares, one without mssi is the 1st to tell investors domestic China is no longer just an opt in.
NEUT2|Investors won't all have to rush in at once.
NEUT3|Today's decision takes effect next year and to begin with, a shares will account for just nought.
NEUT4|Point 7% of the index that requires less than 20 billion of net inflows.
NEUT5|The shares included are also all available through the Stock Connect system that links the Hong Kong market with Shanghai and Shenzen, meaning that while Mssi followers may now be forced to look at mainland stocks, they will be able to trade them at least from the comfort of Hong Kong.
NEUT6|One question is whether MSC Eyes rival Index providers will follow suit in equities.
NEUT7|Footsies operated parallel system for a few years and approach that Bloomberg, which is big in bond markets, has also adopted.
NEUT8|But the real key question is far simpler if are harder to answer right now, will MSC eyes move, forcing investors into mainland equities?
BULL9|"Encourage them to go further and buy more Chinese stocks and they would have done without this push."""
