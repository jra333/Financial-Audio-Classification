NEUT0|"""Is trading in making money."
BEAR1|So this year has been a lot of disappointment.
BEAR2|Disappointing to people because several times like oh this has got to be the bottom and then it falls another 20% and then they're like OK, but this is the bottom and then it keeps plunging just from your sort of trader kept.
NEUT3|What would be the types of things you'd watch for to say OK, Now this is truly capitulation.
NEUT4|Is it just sort of indifference?
NEUT5|Overall like a sense that everyone is truly given up or actually getting their signals like that?
BEAR6|Now they are size are buried, the markets going straight down the markets, well below its 200 day average.
NEUT7|You look in the chat so everybody's bears.
NEUT8|That's really looking for it.
BEAR9|It's the wrong time of year.
NEUT10|There's tax loss and actually tax gain selling from last year that people didn't do yet.
NEUT11|So I'm looking for those indications and the opposite of what happened this year, when, when, when we mentioned Ethereum when Therium's main competitor he was launched and we had that pump.
NEUT12|We had Bitcoin cash pump, those kind of things you need to see the opposite when the market gets buried and looks oversold.
NEUT13|This is not there yet.
NEUT14|Do you think there is any correlation between risk appetite and legacy markets like stocks and crypto?
NEUT15|Or sweetly?
BEAR16|I think people are missing that point.
NEUT17|Last year was a key thing.
BEAR18|The VIX was the lowest, the longest ever.
BULL19|At the same time at almost within the same month that Bitcoin reached the highest forever.
NEUT20|And guess what?
NEUT21|We're just mean reverting right now in the key level.
NEUT22|If you look at means in like this and P 524 hundred in the box is 1500 markets coming back to that?
NEUT23|To me it's not as big as the housing market in 2008 when the VIX reached the previous low, but to me that's a key thing that needs to be mentioned.
NEUT24|Is this bubble we had is just bursting and it's happening everywhere in the stock market is just indicative.
NEUT25|What markets needed to do is mean revert.
BULL26|And the VIX is going back to its normal level.
NEUT27|So what happened to the diversified trade?
NEUT28|What happened to this being separate in some way from this equity market?
NEUT29|Do you see it as something very similar risk, so they make a great observation where you can get crushed and that's happened to me.
NEUT30|I started buying this tip.
NEUT31|I thought that it was 12,010 thousand.
NEUT32|And you know, I've preached dollar cost averaging and I'm trying to stay discipline 'cause the problem is is it was easy for me to.
NEUT33|Put in money back then.
NEUT34|But now because I've invested so much money it's hard, but I'm forcing myself to continue to still dollar cost average and spread out my by so that if these dips occur which it keeps happening, you keep buying into it and then just having to discipline to know that I'm going to be holding this asset long term.
NEUT35|But there is some sentiment that the rebound will not happen for awhile and then some people think it's going to happen quickly.
NEUT36|So my main goal is just to educate myself and to learn more about the market and just to stay disciplined and continue to buy these dips.
NEUT37|"But let me know your thoughts on this and I will talk to you soon."""
