NEUT0|"""Welcome everyone to stockmarketfunding.com and for all the people that enjoyed buying Amazon and staying in it up around the 142 to 148 range."
BEAR1|We have dropped $20 off of that high when Amazon came out with its earnings and so we've had some pretty good pullbacks in these stocks and what I want you to know is that if you go to stockmarketfunding.com, we talked about it for the last couple of weeks.
BEAR2|That these stocks were going to come barreling down off their highs, and a lot of them have given up $20 moves off their high.
NEUT3|K If you don't believe me, here's Apple Computer 272 was a high 248.
BEAR4|So within the last week the retail investor once again has been dismantled and dissected.
NEUT5|What we did with Amazon today is it closed at one 2983?
NEUT6|We use the stock market pending.
NEUT7|Mechanical platform, which is a mathematical system.
NEUT8|We had a lot of traders sum up, got one 2785, some got 1/26/10.
NEUT9|And they were selling in the up move 138.
NEUT10|Do the math low to high and here's how you do it.
NEUT11|You use the SMF Pro trade or buy bar right here.
NEUT12|That was the doji.
NEUT13|That was the by bar.
NEUT14|It didn't look back.
NEUT15|You enter the trade, you keep the stop.
NEUT16|You'll let it run.
BULL17|You also learn that the SMF Pro Trader Indicators are working at its finest during this move off of the bottom.
BULL18|And that was a nice move, and that Makde was a sending up.
NEUT19|That's the power you could look over here.
NEUT20|Let me show you what was going on with the volume part of it, which was quite nice during that time frame.
NEUT21|This went along with it.
BULL22|Equity went along with it and it might make it.
BULL23|We sold up towards that peak.
BULL24|That's a very strong stock.
NEUT25|There's your low.
BULL26|That's the up move off of this low right here one 2755.
NEUT27|There's where it started.
NEUT28|There's the doji that cleared the high of that bar.
NEUT29|That's the entry.
NEUT30|That's what we did.
NEUT31|Once again we did it live while not Memorex.
NEUT32|"We don't just talk to talk the talents here."""
