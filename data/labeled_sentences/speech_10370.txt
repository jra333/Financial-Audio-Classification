NEUT0|"""Let me come at this from another angle, though."
NEUT1|At these prices, quantum scapes valued at more than 34 billion.
NEUT2|When Kensington Capital merged with Quantum Scape, they valued it at 3.3 billion.
NEUT3|You're paying 10 times with this pack.
BULL4|Paid capital raises sales management believes they can make 3.2 billion in revenues.
NEUT5|In 2027, seven years away.
NEUT6|In other words, right now the stock is trading at more than 10 * 2027 sales forecasts, and that's a very optimistic forecast to begin with, and to me that's expensive.
NEUT7|Listen, I love quantum scape.
BULL8|The company I believe they have real chance to revolutionize the electric vehicle business with their battery technology, but the stock I think it's jumped the shark.
NEUT9|Yeah, I think I I take some off the table here, trusted you, get a better price down along the lockup.
NEUT10|Expires and warrants.
NEUT11|Get cold in something that's crushed.
BULL12|Other electrics back.
NEUT13|Stocks like Nicola and and highly on which you guys constantly want me to recommend in my Twitter feed.
BEAR14|Of course, quantum scape is just the poster child for an unsustainable move across the whole group.
NEUT15|Let's talk about Luminar, which makes Lidar systems like radar with lasers.
BULL16|Bobby I spotted higher since I recommended $18.00 last week.
BULL17|Loomers technology is terrific for autonomous driving, but since it merged with this pack sponsor, the stocks soared as high as $47.
NEUT18|Two days ago.
BEAR19|It's already started pulling back to 34 as of today, but it's still way up.
NEUT20|I like women are $18.00 but if you don't take something off the table in the mid 30s I think you're asking for trouble right now.
NEUT21|Selling for 14 times management 2025 sales forecast and I I think that's too expensive, but look if you think this is just that it doesn't matter.
NEUT22|It's on a Tesla.
NEUT23|I get that.
NEUT24|I mean, it's not even sun in Norwegian cruise lines, but that stock goes up everyday.
NEUT25|Next up is CIGS merger and that's joining forces with arrival and that's a British company that's working on electric vans and buses with a very cool microfactory concept.
NEUT26|I wish I could come up with that term.
NEUT27|I would have patent it that could revolutionize manufacturing, I recommended CIGS last week at $21, said preferred, better in the high teens, but $21.
BULL28|It's now $31 and that's after pulling back over the last couple of days.
BEAR29|Again a little something off the table.
NEUT30|Please go buy you something nice.
NEUT31|I don't even care for Kashmir anymore.
NEUT32|Hey, I don't know.
NEUT33|Maybe you get one of those itchy wool sweaters.
NEUT34|What happened?
NEUT35|One of those you know fisherman sweaters?
NEUT36|Finally?
NEUT37|Hennessy capitals.
NEUT38|Merging with canoe?
NEUT39|Another electric play with a modular design platform, I gave you my blessing to dip your toe into this one last Friday.
NEUT40|$13.00 now it's at 22.
NEUT41|Give you 64% gain in less than four days.
NEUT42|I don't.
NEUT43|I don't want to be responsible anymore.
