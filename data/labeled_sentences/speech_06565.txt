BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome back to extend channel."
NEUT1|It's a Thursday 13th of August.
NEUT2|I'm Christina Bertha Neal, investment analyst and today will be looking at how the Australian dollar versus the Japanese yen is technically performing in the daily chart.
BEAR3|So when you look at the chart, the market is pushing again for a break above a long term resistance area around 76.70, which has been strongly restrictive to upside movements for more than a year now.
BEAR4|This follows a rebound near the black ascending trendline earlier this week, which signal that the price could.
NEUT5|Look for more gains, center their assigned.
NEUT6|The Stochastics are still in favor of this scenario because their size above its 50 neutral market.
BEAR7|This to Clastics have a rebound and again but if we compare this indicators with the price action we can realize that the indicators have been making lower highs at the time the price was holding above the upper surface of its range area over the past two months and that remains reminds a bearish divergent pattern which suggests that the sellers may be preparing to step up.
NEUT8|Technically this requires a drop below her.
NEUT9|The black trendline.
BEAR10|If this is the case, the price could fall into these 74.85 and 74 supportive zone where the 50 day moving average is placed while below that the focus will shift to the 72.50 low from June 12th and the 200 day moving average beneath.
NEUT11|On the upside.
BULL12|Now I could reject the bearish scenario of if the price manages to close decisively above the 76.70 wall, and more importantly.
BULL13|If it crosses above 77.50 and accelerate towards the key 79.88 number where the 200 moving average has been planning for the past three months in the weekly chart.
NEUT14|So that's all for Alsean today.
BULL15|"Thank you for watching and good luck with your trading."""
