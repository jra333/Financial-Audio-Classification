NEUT0|"""You know one of the things I do in terms of philanthropy."
NEUT1|I'm on the I'm on the Board of directors of the Girl Scouts of New York City and part of the reason why I decided to spend my spare time doing that is a lot of what the Girl Scouts has stood for, and I will tell you, I was a Girl Scout.
NEUT2|But really, what they teach girls is to how to be courageous.
NEUT3|How they have reinvented the Girl Scouts and made them relevant in today's world is the exact same thing I'm trying to do.
NEUT4|This asset management firm, an asset management firm that was 100 years old, reinventing them with having strategies that can help serve people's needs and meet their financial goals for the future.
NEUT5|Same thing.
NEUT6|Nuveen was started 100 years ago by John Nuveen.
NEUT7|It was a small municipal bond shop located in Chicago, and it was all about building the infrastructure for America.
NEUT8|So think of highways and bridges.
NEUT9|That's what they did 100 years ago.
NEUT10|The new Nuveen is a combination of Nuveen asset management capabilities with TIAS asset management capabilities.
NEUT11|Just about 2 1/2 years ago I joined as the CMO, an.
NEUT12|I was asked my job and part of the reason why I was so excited about this job.
NEUT13|Was to develop what's the name of the new company?
NEUT14|What's this new asset management firm with a trillion dollars new?
NEUT15|What are they going to stand for in the marketplace?
NEUT16|An as you know there are thousands of asset managers out there, so how are we going to differentiate ourselves in this very competitive space?
NEUT17|Product sale is at the end of the funnel, and so it's first and foremost is.
NEUT18|You need people need to.
NEUT19|Like you like the brand, they need to believe that the brand is smart, that the brand has valuable insights at their kredible and that's the part that marketing really plays.
NEUT20|A big role is creating that likeability.
NEUT21|I've been in the asset management industry for too long for quite awhile.
NEUT22|We launched the brand, you know, externally.
NEUT23|Really in the fall of 2018, and so we've just really begun to tell the broader Nuveen story.
NEUT24|An you know that we are a trillion dollars in assets under management.
NEUT25|People are surprised by that that with the 15th largest asset manager in the world we can use social media to show some of these stories because of the intangible Ness of the real assets that we own and so that creates a whole different story.
NEUT26|For people to think of us, not just the traditional equity fixed income investing, but it we have real assets, farmland, timber, real estate and we also have responsible investing.
NEUT27|I embrace change.
NEUT28|I love to try new things, new thinking I'd like to.
NEUT29|It's funny because when I talk to junior people in the industry, I always tell them be big, bold and brave.
BULL30|"For good, that was easy."""
