BEAR0|"""It seems that once the sellers ran out of ammo."
NEUT1|No more stock left to sell.
NEUT2|The buyers ran right back in Bye bye Bye Bye Bye bye bye.
BULL3|Dow surging poured in 40 points.
BEAR4|As some people voting 2.01%, NASDAQ soaring, 2.71% how supplied.
NEUT5|So how do we explain this incredible rebound?
NEUT6|Even as the ******* **** give up some of their gains in the last half hour of trading, it's easy enough to argue that things are simply better than we think, and that's definitely a part of it, but not the whole thing.
NEUT7|It doesn't explain the broad base of this rally.
BEAR8|We had a dramatic decline in Tech late last week, and yesterday, those same tech stocks were higher today.
NEUT9|No surprise there.
NEUT10|Last night I told you these cells tend to last three days.
NEUT11|And then check bounces back.
NEUT12|That's exactly what happened with shock me though.
NEUT13|Was the incredible buying in the industrial, the retailers and the railroads?
NEUT14|The last being really surprising?
NEUT15|Although born in other words, we had a rally in both the covid stocks in the recovery stocks when nearly everything goes up, you'll hear people came up with that.
NEUT16|It's there for the federal people betting on a stimulus package for mindless dip buyers.
BEAR17|I think there's explanations miss the mark.
NEUT18|How do we figure out the real driver of this move?
NEUT19|First, let's go over what we know for sure.
NEUT20|There's a semiconductor company you may not know it.
NEUT21|I think it's important to have a joke that it sounds like Cuervo.
NEUT22|Its name is Corvo QRV O with a ton of exposure to Wi-Fi.
NEUT23|The Internet of Things and smart phones, especially 5G now last night, in a quiet moment, the people weren't thinking about.
BEAR24|Corvo Pre announced some absurdly better than expected numbers and their product portfolio is so broad that it caused a ton of positive pin action.
NEUT25|What comes to mind?
NEUT26|Well think the other cell phone chip makers that have been leaders of this market.
NEUT27|I'm talking bout Skyworks solutions an XP and you feel communications.
NEUT28|How about Qualcomm?
NEUT29|We know them as the King of cell phones.
NEUT30|Think about the industrial chip makers and there he got Texas Instruments.
NEUT31|An Analog Devices one recently telling a good story.
NEUT32|You can even extrapolate to Cramer faves AMD and NVIDIA.
NEUT33|The latter is always in the conversation.
NEUT34|And it's not 'cause, it's just the dogs.
NEUT35|Those are the two most important semiconductor companies in this entire market.
NEUT36|If you ask me.
BULL37|Not to mention Broadcom, now Broadcom, ABG oh they had the misfortune of reporting when I wasn't around and what a fantastic quarter they had.
NEUT38|Now same goes for Marvelle, another one of my favorite Caesar.
NEUT39|All action alerts names.
BEAR40|That's a 5 cheap players just like Corvo and that's Liberty huge quarter that also fell through the cracks during the sell off.
NEUT41|I wasn't here.
BEAR42|I was busy in the tomato plants doing the tomato place because I do got locked out of the house 'cause I spent too much time with tomato plants.
NEUT43|Now the pin action doesn't stop here.
NEUT44|You also gotta consider the end markets if courses corpus moving lots of chips.
BULL45|Well, then why can't we just presume that cell phones around the world must be in good shape in the last few days, bearish analysts have mulled Apple.
NEUT46|They've been all over it with their cells.
NEUT47|And it's not as good as it used to be.
NEUT48|All that nonsense.
NEUT49|Well guess what?
NEUT50|Wait till you wake up tomorrow and you will see so many people born Apple because Corvo gave it a reason to repair.
