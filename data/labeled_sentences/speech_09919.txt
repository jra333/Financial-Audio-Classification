NEUT0|"""HCMC stock healthier Choice management Corp."
NEUT1|Welcome so we're going to talk about HCMC stock and you can see here that the stock has gone.
BEAR2|Taken a really big downtrend since it went up to 65.
NEUT3|We're going to remove the zeros.
BEAR4|College 65 gone all the way down to 14 Area 15 area and it's been stuck in this area for the past two weeks or so.
BEAR5|You can see here the volume has significantly gone down since we had this area back here where the volume was a lot higher and now it's.
BEAR6|It's gone down significantly here in this area.
NEUT7|You can see this few weeks that there was a lot of hype around the stock and they were thinking about what was happening with the lawsuit that they filed against Philip Morris.
BEAR8|Since then, we've had a significant decline, and I know a lot of people are now holding the stock.
NEUT9|I never bought this stock.
BEAR10|I never got into it, it just something felt a little bit off to me to think to get into the stock at the point that it was going up so significantly here.
NEUT11|And once it pull back to.
NEUT12|Also, I didn't.
NEUT13|I didn't get find my area to get in.
BEAR14|Currently it's really really getting tight on this consolidation here on the zero 15 area.
BULL15|If it is able to break out, even if the 0.2 area with some volume, I think there will be huge interest again in the stock.
NEUT16|I don't know if it's going to come from some news or for some new interest, or maybe our Wall Street brothers will get you know into the stack, will have to see if something happens about that, but currently I don't see anything in the near future that would able to would be able to move the stack.
NEUT17|Away from this area, we could see a consolidation a few weeks on the stock for the zero point 15 area.
BEAR18|Currently, if we look we're getting in there little bit of the oversold area 0.42.
BULL19|Sorry, not zero point 42 area on the RSI, so we're getting closer and closer to the 30 area which was the oversold area.
NEUT20|This Mac did.
NEUT21|The blue is under the yellow.
NEUT22|You can see since around this area when we crossed here the 0.34 area.
NEUT23|So if we are able to get back to that area maybe that would be a consideration to buying back into.
NEUT24|Buying the stock, but currently just the way the stock is has been playing out.
NEUT25|I don't see this stock as a buy currently.
BEAR26|I'm sorry I might get killed in the comments for it.
NEUT27|I know that a lot of people love this talk, but I just don't see any any reason to buy it from a technical analysis standpoint of view and also from a company point of view, I think that it could be a long time till this lawsuit is resolved.
NEUT28|So we're going to have to see.
NEUT29|Maybe I'm wrong.
NEUT30|Hopefully it goes to the moon and I'm wrong about that.
BEAR31|The stochastic all the red is under the purple is telling us that there's a negative downtrend here and we can see it in our own eyes that even since here when it was around 16, now it's gone down to 14.
NEUT32|So we have to think of this as not 000, but it's 14.
BEAR33|Then you can see that going down from 16 to 14 is a significant drop, so going forward it will be every interesting to see if the stock can break out of this 15 area or not.
