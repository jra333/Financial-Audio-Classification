NEUT0|"""It wouldn't be a day of technology if we didn't mention Apple, and thankfully from you."
BULL1|We continue to get more St highs this time.
NEUT2|You now have a street high of $350.00 a share.
NEUT3|If you come and take a look at a chart in my terminal that is well above the median analyst and well above where the company is trading now.
NEUT4|So why 350?
NEUT5|What's behind that call?
NEUT6|Yeah, it's really a continuation or thesis playing out from this year into next year in terms of the Super cycle.
NEUT7|I mean I, it really comes down to the math.
BEAR8|900,000,000 iPhones worldwide, about a third of those 350,000,000 have not upgraded 39 months, and I think we are going into a super cycle.
NEUT9|5G is going to be on the tail end of that, and I think when you look at that in mind in the install base, some of the parts I think this is a re reading stock that continues to go higher.
NEUT10|I think 350 is base case.
NEUT11|I continue look out 2-3 years.
NEUT12|You could see a Stockton now starts to approach a trillion half $2 trillion.
NEUT13|In terms of that core thesis playing out over the next two years, what if the upgrade supercycle doesn't materialize?
NEUT14|It's a great question, and that I think is the bear thesis is because we've been there before.
NEUT15|What happened to five Jesus bust, specially on the 1st on the 1st part?
NEUT16|Now I look at right now, if you could iPhone 11.
NEUT17|And you'll get the trajectory going into later this year.
BULL18|I can tell you from our work that we've done easier.
NEUT19|It looks like right now lie in the sand about 200,000,000 units for the 5G cycle.
BULL20|So in terms of suppliers, all indications are that's going to be a real strong product cycle.
BULL21|There could be speed bumps, and I think we'll of course hit those in a given quarter going into 2020, but as of right now, the visibility looks as strong as we've seen it.
NEUT22|You know, I'd have to go back 5-6 years in terms of where I've seen, and that's really why we have such a bull thesis here.
NEUT23|"And Apple, in terms of not just the rocket, Gibraltar, iPhone in terms of services and re rating."""
