NEUT0|"""Alright, so for now it's free training video where we're taking a look at the CME, one of the largest futures exchanges in the world."
NEUT1|And what we're looking at here is we had a Darvas box long trade.
NEUT2|So in this area.
NEUT3|This is how this trade works.
NEUT4|You, the indicator draws in a box and then once it breaks out of this box, let's time for along.
NEUT5|Now what will happen a lot is it'll retrace some and then what you're looking for is if you zoom in here is you want to enter on the close above the high of the low bar or the loading.
NEUT6|So in other words you can do different ways you can do it.
NEUT7|You can either get along.
NEUT8|And just go ahead and get along right there.
NEUT9|Or you can wait until you get a low bar.
NEUT10|In other words, a low bar here.
NEUT11|So we're going to call this the low and then this is the high of the low, so that's the high of the low.
NEUT12|Anytime you get a close above that, that's an automatic long signal and then your target is going to be this most recent high on.
NEUT13|See me stop is up to you, but I would use half the width of this box which would be around 3:10 or slightly higher around 3:15.
BULL14|Good luck, hope it helps.
NEUT15|"See you tomorrow."""
