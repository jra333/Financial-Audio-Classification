NEUT0|"""Janet Yellen's four year term as the first female chair of the Federal Reserve has just ended."
NEUT1|How did she do?
NEUT2|Well?
NEUT3|the Fed officially has a dual mandate to maintain full employment and to keep inflation stable and on that basis.
NEUT4|As you can see, it's very hard to complain about anything she's done.
NEUT5|The target for inflation has been 2% throughout her time.
NEUT6|In office, and that's almost exactly where inflation is now.
BULL7|It dipped a little in the middle, but basically inflation has stayed nicely under control throughout their time.
BEAR8|Meanwhile, even if there is very serious ongoing structural long term unemployment, the unemployment rate has fallen consistently throughout her term, so it's hard to complain about the job she's done there.
BULL9|Now, if we take a look at what many people care about most when it comes to the financial world, which is the performance of the stock market, you can see that American stocks have performed.
NEUT10|Fantastically, under the Yellen fed the S&P in itself, these all of these numbers are rebaste.
BULL11|There's obviously gained almost 50% over that time.
NEUT12|If you deflate that buy gold, which can be a way of showing whether whether this is really been achieved by currency debasement.
BULL13|You can see that the SNP is strongly outperformed gold as well.
BULL14|And if you compare it to the footsies rest of the world index, you can see that the US has indeed strongly.
BULL15|Outperformed the rest of the world in terms of its stock market during Janet Yellen's tenure.
BEAR16|Again, it's very hard to complain about the results that she is managed in her four years now.
BULL17|What's impressive is that she has done this even as the Fed has.
BULL18|After many years of record, low interest rates raised rates five times, but here.
NEUT19|Perhaps her record can be a little overstated.
NEUT20|What we're looking at here is what's happened to the balance sheet over the last 10 years under her predecessor.
BULL21|Ben Bernanke the balance sheet expanded hugely.
NEUT22|In other words, they bought lots of bonds and attempt to push bond yields.
BEAR23|Interest rates down under Janet Yellen, we saw the end of that program and then the very very tiny, barely visible move towards reducing the balance sheets again.
NEUT24|But if you take a look at the Chicago Fed's Financial Conditions Index, you can see that in fact any the lower the number is there.
NEUT25|That means the easier financial conditions are.
BULL26|Thanks to QE, aggressive expansion by other central banks, financial conditions have in fact steadily got easier in the US under Janet Yellen's tenure, you could argue that she has been lucky.
NEUT27|It is, however, very hard to argue that she doesn't deserve another term.
NEUT28|Jay Powell, her successor, has been on the board for the last four years.
NEUT29|He is regarded as a continuity candidate, but it does raise the issue.
NEUT30|"Why was it necessary to hire him when a better qualified woman was available?"""
