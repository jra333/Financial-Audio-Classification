NEUT0|"""Hey try this John how he in this video we're going to talk about the Facebook stock quote or Facebook stock market update."
NEUT1|So let's get into it.
NEUT2|I had tried this.
NEUT3|Done holy again.
NEUT4|If you don't have a comment.
NEUT5|I just sent this video is general advice only.
NEUT6|This is not.
NEUT7|This is not good to your personal situation or your personal circumstance.
NEUT8|This is just to give you a bit of an update of what I see on Facebook.
NEUT9|OK try the market is risky.
NEUT10|Be sensible with your trading right.
NEUT11|Disclaimer out of the way, let's get into it now.
NEUT12|Looking at Facebook here we're looking at I'm looking at here on a daily chart and I'm doing this.
NEUT13|I'm doing this video recording it.
NEUT14|On the end, on this day here, let's go back to this day here, which is the 28th of the 7th.
NEUT15|OK, so that's the day that I'm actually doing the recording.
NEUT16|The recording for this for Facebook.
NEUT17|Now the first thing I do see with Facebook is that we were going sideways for quite some time and then we start we got we got.
BEAR18|We got a big run back up through here and then the market came down.
BEAR19|Then Marcus other breaking out through here had a nice big run up to the high side and then now it's now it's having a bit of a bit of a pullback through here.
NEUT20|And if we squeeze our chat up with more, we can actually see it's had a big thumping through here and now we've had a pull back, so you can really see by looking at the moving averages as well.
NEUT21|You can say that this shorter term moving average and this longer term moving average and this moving average there both for turning up some Facebook is in a big upward trend.
BULL22|OK, a big upward trend.
NEUT23|I remember in December this thing came out like a $40 and people like oh it's too expensive by 40.
NEUT24|It's like almost 100 now or basically almost digita 100 up there, so you know.
NEUT25|So this is where we are right now.
NEUT26|So for my liking guides for what I'm looking for is I'm looking for a bit more of a pullback.
NEUT27|OK so right now I will I I'm actually liking.
NEUT28|I'm actually like in Dubai.
NEUT29|Facebook, but I'm more of a shorter term trade anytime any like one to five, maybe one to two week trade one day do after two weeks straight.
NEUT30|So I want a bit more of a pullback bit more pullback.
NEUT31|Want to get verbal back close this gap through here so I can see that there once the gaps close.
NEUT32|I want to stick down the bottom here showing me a turning point and then I'll be happy to start getting in there.
NEUT33|So that's basically what I'm looking for.
NEUT34|Guys on Facebook looking through there if we bring up the weekly chart here, this is the weekly chart looking at here you can see we just had an enormous.
NEUT35|Norma's run to the high side with with Facebook there and so that's what's happening with Facebook guys.
NEUT36|Overall a quick market up by Quickstar quick Facebook update here.
