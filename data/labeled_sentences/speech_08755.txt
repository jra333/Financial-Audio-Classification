NEUT0|"""Age playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another day today that I mean it was a fine day.
NEUT5|As far as training everything like that, but from a technical position where I said trying to, you know, make these presentations just a whole lot of chop.
NEUT6|Right now.
NEUT7|I mean, all these things seems to be doing right now is up, down, up, down up, down, so I mean it's just kind of.
NEUT8|In other words, we need to kind of cut through the chop, you know, just try to how do we ignore all this noise?
NEUT9|So that's all this is right now from a charting perspective.
NEUT10|It's just a whole lot of noise.
NEUT11|Whole lot of Chapins in order to do that.
NEUT12|What I want to get drawn up here and just focus on moving forward is more so this overall pattern that has taken place.
NEUT13|And this pattern right here.
NEUT14|Has that red line right there and then the support portion of the pattern?
NEUT15|Down here and actually let me change that.
NEUT16|To green to represent support, but this is really the main level and main overall pattern that matters the most.
NEUT17|Assuming you care about more so the bigger picture Now if you are a daytrader Ann, you're all about buying and selling within 10 minutes, well then yeah.
NEUT18|I mean, I'm not going to say this entire video would be worthless to you, because, yeah, there's there's zero B value in it.
NEUT19|But this is geared more so for somebody that's just trying to gauge and understand more.
NEUT20|So a broader viewpoint of the chart.
NEUT21|And really, it's just a waiting game right now.
NEUT22|The waiting game.
NEUT23|Is this.
NEUT24|What is the price actually want to do 'cause all it's been doing right now?
NEUT25|As I pointed out, is just chopping all over the place.
NEUT26|So what does it actually want to do?
NEUT27|It's got really two choices.
NEUT28|The Bulls can show up in a big way, work their way up to this area and get the break out of the pattern, so untouchable jargon, attentional pattern breakout, or the bears are going to show up.
NEUT29|Press the price down to that lower portion and then in training jargon a technical pattern breakdown by pushing down to that level.
NEUT30|So that's really what it comes down to is we kind of got to just wait and see what does the price actually want to do within this pattern itself?
NEUT31|Doesn't want to just continue to shop around.
NEUT32|Or is the price actually going to make some sort of bigger move, so those are going to be the main levels that I'm watching going forward.
NEUT33|And you know this overall pattern here, just kind of like I said, cut through all the noise cut through all the chop and let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL37|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT43|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT45|That is again totally live.
NEUT46|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT47|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
