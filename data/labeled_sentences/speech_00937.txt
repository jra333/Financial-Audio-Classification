BEAR0|"""Bonds and equities have been on a long rally, and although the VIX, a measure of the market volatility has climbed near 20 in the past days, it is still reasonably low in historical context."
BEAR1|Some argue the market is ripe for a correction.
NEUT2|That are investors that are complacent but their investors that are sceptical also and the evidence we get from position indicators we try keys is rather makes.
NEUT3|For example our client service, which structure duration, exposure of different types of clients so that while single currency investors were pretty long duration ahead of last weeks, submitting multi currency investors had rather low duration exposure.
NEUT4|And that is a different picture from a year ago at the beginning of 2015, ahead of the Boonville.
NEUT5|So when both types of investors had pretty high duration exposure, they var socks we experience in the past like the bond were sunk in April 2015, where underpinned by three conditions low volatility over stretch position at overstretch valuations.
NEUT6|And not all these conditions are currently in place, even the vault space rate Volt deliver volatility in rates was not.
NEUT7|As low as deliver equity Vol ahead of last weeks, it will be meeting.
NEUT8|For example, in this chart here you can see that systematic it's funds Reese parity funds that are the base, their strategies and volatility at CTA's.
NEUT9|Commodity trading advisors that they trade based on trades and different markets.
NEUT10|Are heavy in terms of their equity exposure.
NEUT11|This is the implied equity exposure with derived by looking at the relationship between their performance and the performance of the equity market, and that suggests that ahead of last week's ECB meeting, just before the correction began, we had some sort of vulnerability from these two types of investors.
NEUT12|However, there are other types of hedge funds.
NEUT13|The opposite you can see here two other types of hedge funds, equity long short at discretionary macro hedge funds.
BEAR14|They appear to have reduced their equity exposure ahead of last week's ECB meeting at this special, especially discretionary macro, hedge funds had rather low equity exposure.
BEAR15|That mixed evidence to me suggests that we are unlikely to see this mini tantrum.
BEAR16|We saw the end of last week cascading.
NEUT17|If you want into a big reversal.
NEUT18|Dust off your vinyl dark side of the moon.
NEUT19|"Exile in Main Street, maybe even never mind the ******** because the world is heading right back to the 70s."""
