NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Andrea Coombes and this is MarketWatch an learn taking care of your 401K can mean the difference between a fun retirement Anna difficult 1401 K's and four three bees are too common workplace plans and putting money in immediately cuts your tax bill because your contribution comes out of your paycheck before taxes."
NEUT1|You don't have to pay tax on your 401K savings until you withdraw the money in retirement.
NEUT2|Here are some ways to manage your account.
NEUT3|One pick investments carefully.
NEUT4|Your investment choices will likely include money market funds, bond and stock funds, target date funds.
NEUT5|And your employer stock.
NEUT6|Choose investments that meet your goals.
NEUT7|And remember, most financial pros say you shouldn't invest more than five or 10% in your company's stock, because more than that puts your retirement at risk.
NEUT8|Next, does your employer offer a match if you don't contribute to your plan?
NEUT9|You're passing up free money so your company matches 50% of the 1st 6% you save with a $35,000 a year salary.
NEUT10|A 6% contribution is $2100.
NEUT11|You get another 1050 from your employers match.
NEUT12|Don't miss out.
NEUT13|OK, now withdrawals?
NEUT14|You may be able to take out a loan to buy your first house or for school medical costs or economic hardship.
NEUT15|Usually that loan has to be paid back within five years with interest, and there are two big risks here.
NEUT16|One, you're short, changing your retirement to reap the power of long term compounding.
NEUT17|Let the money sit.
NEUT18|Set aside emergency savings so you don't need loans.
BEAR19|The second risk is if you leave your job, you'll have to pay that loan back quickly or face a tax bill plus a 10% penalty.
BEAR20|"Now that's a hit you want to avoid."""
