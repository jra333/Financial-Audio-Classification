BEAR0|"""When they say that the numbers at Home Depot came below their expected expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with their Home Depot strategic investments, what do they mean?"
NEUT1|What look Home Depot is technologically always trying to get ahead of the curve?
BULL2|I believe that will hear and I think you really make the great point David.
NEUT3|We don't know yet at 9, but the thing it really does bother me is is that this is the first time we really knew that they were doing something big.
NEUT4|Why didn't they tell us they were doing something big so we would know that they didn't beat what they were supposed to be doing it?
BULL5|Playing out disappointment in terms of the narrative at the same time remember one of the great companies houses charts this morning were very good.
NEUT6|I think that people will.
NEUT7|Let's say understand it, the one that is much harder.
NEUT8|When is Michelle Goss going to get it together?
NEUT9|CEO of Kohl's and let's hope that the expenses are related to the fact that they added Amazon to the back of the store because patience is wearing thin with someone who frankly doesn't really have anything special.
NEUT10|They're not the lowest prices.
NEUT11|They don't have a really good online strategy.
NEUT12|I need to then have a good offline strategy.
NEUT13|I gotta hear something about Amazon, or else people are going to say is Kohl's Macy's, which reports later this week.
BEAR14|Because I've got to tell you, this is awful.
NEUT15|Yeah, clearly we're not seeing that plan to allow you to do pick up and deliver drop off through Amazon.
NEUT16|Getting any traction.
NEUT17|One more thing on Depot though, Jim, do we believe them on the timing of these investments?
BEAR18|'cause we know we got retail sales on Friday and building materials were negative for the second month in a row.
NEUT19|Point blank, I say yes because mirrors no different from previous CEOs like Frank Blake.
NEUT20|What they're about is honesty, transparency and truth.
NEUT21|I'm out here at Salesforce Home Depot, old time customer and I just feel like the one thing I did want to know was at summer spend should have been better.
NEUT22|Outside furniture should have been.
BULL23|Better Grill should have been better.
NEUT24|Let's see what they have to say.
NEUT25|I know that if you bought it the last two times that that it blew up, so to speak.
NEUT26|They were great buys.
NEUT27|It remains the H in watch Kohl's I've got to tell you.
NEUT28|I still don't get Kohl's, I mean, I just think Michelle, I think she's a very very, very good person in terms of what needs to be done at a retailer that had been kind of nothing.
NEUT29|That's special, but the investing in future that Home Depot is telling you right now this moment, realize that almost entirely involved with making the stores better.
NEUT30|No particular theme, supply chain pro and services, product innovation.
BEAR31|It looks really hard.
NEUT32|It's called the One Home Depot experience.
NEUT33|Well, what the hell?
NEUT34|Why did we know about the one Home Depot experience beforehand in terms of a way to be able to gauge it?
BEAR35|"So Home Depot might be down for two days, not one."""
