NEUT0|"""This is an interesting one Sonoco getting sold selling itself upright for about five and a half billion dollars 500 give us the details on this one."
NEUT1|Yeah, well, I think the interesting things about this deal is kind of what it says about the energy market in general.
NEUT2|An you know the most obvious point is Sonoco has been around since the 1880s.
NEUT3|It's a very storied refining and marketing company used to be in all explorers sold their stuff off years and years ago.
NEUT4|I think what this shows is really just how you know.
NEUT5|How much suffering the refining business has gone through 'cause in actual fact you know energy transfer which is a company buying Sonoco.
NEUT6|They don't really want the refineries.
NEUT7|In fact, they're not even part of this deal and Sonoco right now is trying to get Carlisle to take its last refinery in a joint venture and the gasoline stations that energy transfer will buy.
NEUT8|They will.
NEUT9|I would imagine there will probably sell those off to a different refining company.
NEUT10|Well, they really want other pipelines, and that's where a lot of the excitement in this business is these days, mainly because.
BULL11|We've obviously seen a big turn around in America's gas and oil output, but mostly in non traditional areas.
NEUT12|You know up in the Upper Midwest and right North Dakota, different parts of Texas, Pennsylvania, places that haven't seen that much activity for decades.
NEUT13|And what that means is it's kind of redrawing the map in terms of pipelines.
NEUT14|Who owns those pipelines where you want them to be connected to?
NEUT15|And So what we've seen is refined.
BEAR16|The refining business is kind of on a real downturn.
NEUT17|But the guys who owned the pipelines that are building amount are expanding massively.
NEUT18|Last year we saw this huge deal between Kinder Morgan and El Paso where they bought that business.
NEUT19|They got rid of the oil exploration assets.
NEUT20|They didn't want those at all, and that's really what we're seeing with today's deal.
NEUT21|So what does Sonoco's pipeline network like?
NEUT22|I mean, everyone knows Sonoco, we just showed in the banner there for the gas stations and all that.
NEUT23|What's the pipeline network like?
NEUT24|Well, the thing.
NEUT25|The thing that that energy transfer is really interested in is the fact that Sonoco has a big liquid's pipeline network.
NEUT26|It's mostly up in the Northeast, but it also hooks down into the Gulf Coast.
BEAR27|And traditionally, energy transfer has been very focused on Texas and the Gulf Coast and very focused on natural gas, and they've really started to suffer 'cause a few years ago they were making a lot of money out of just shipping natural gas West to East across Texas.
NEUT28|What they found is, as the shale gas revolution's got going, people have come in and built competing pipelines.
NEUT29|Their profits on that business have gone way down and what they really want to do is get into the liquid's business where there's a lot more growth now and where prices are a lot better.
BULL30|Companies are a lot better capitalized.
NEUT31|And so they want to hook that into their existing pipeline and be able to say to companies.
NEUT32|Look, we don't just transfer your gas, were also able to offer you Liquid's and also you know link you to important demand centers like the Northeast.
BULL33|So now we can see Sonoco stock is up about 20% now.
BULL34|So obviously the market likes it up around the premium.
NEUT35|Yeah I mean what is going to happen to know what's going to happen to them?
NEUT36|Like you said, there's a company that goes way back.
NEUT37|Most people know that name very well.
NEUT38|Is this company now being broken up?
NEUT39|Is going to disappear that name going to go away.
NEUT40|Well, the name definitely won't go away because they have a subsidiary in Master Limited partnership called Sonoco Logistics and that will actually be a key part of this deal, and its units will remain listed, so the name won't disappear and I imagine that the gasoline stations got around 5000 gasoline stations.
NEUT41|Like I say, I don't think energy transfer will hang on to those for very long.
NEUT42|They'll probably sell them on, but I doubt that anyone buying them would want to get rid of the brand simply because it.
NEUT43|"You know, it's been around for about 100 and 2000 and 30 years something like that so."""
