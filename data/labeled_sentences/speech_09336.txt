NEUT0|"""My question tonight is about the pharmaceutical lottery."
NEUT1|Some companies say they have a vaccine that you have to keep frozen.
NEUT2|Russia and China said they have a vaccine.
NEUT3|You're not going to hit me with that.
NEUT4|My question is to you.
NEUT5|I have a call option with Pfizer $40 strike Price October 16th.
NEUT6|Am I gonna make it or is my contract sleeping with the Pfizer's?
NEUT7|Sleeping with the Pfizer's Bono and will go to you with this one here.
NEUT8|Pfizer closed the regular session at $37.79.
BEAR9|He's talking about a 40 strike call.
NEUT10|What do we think about Pfizer?
NEUT11|Well, you know what I think if you're in Pfizer you've gotta be liking it for more than just a play on the on the vaccine.
NEUT12|You've got Astra Zeneca.
NEUT13|Now you get fires of biontech and you've gotten Moderna.
NEUT14|Now I will say there are certain things that I like about Pfizer valuation for one.
NEUT15|And the fact that they're kind of spinning off or are getting rid of their their excuse me drawing a blank here, their generics business.
NEUT16|So there's a lot of things to me that are tailwinds for the stock.
NEUT17|With that said, I need to know what you would have paid.
NEUT18|Strike price but I will say is October right?
NEUT19|You're kind of in that sweet spot around route Time Vegas where your value starts to a road, so I would be looking to probably roll that position if you don't get a stock move in pretty short order, alright?
NEUT20|Carter worth we go to you here.
NEUT21|The majority of analysts here on cnbc.com's data Sheet for Pfizer have a hold rating on the stock.
BEAR22|It also is now down about 4% on a year to date basis.
NEUT23|Is this a stock that you want to get involved with?
NEUT24|I mean, I think it goes in the bucket of large cap laggard that has the potential to catch up, and so still some 18% off its all time high again, SNP making all time highs and so this is the kind of thing if you have a very extended name and Apple.
NEUT25|Let's trim some of that and double back and find something like this like a Starbucks like a Pfizer which has lagged that has catch up potential.
NEUT26|So I think this is 1 to look at in terms of the timing.
NEUT27|Yeah, you're cutting it close but October.
NEUT28|There's enough time if things go well, and my inclination would be to hold the option Karen is it?
NEUT29|Is it Pfizer when it comes to Big Pharma or biopharma or is it somebody else out there?
NEUT30|Do you like Pfizer as a name?
NEUT31|I like Pfizer as a name I you know, I think it's been a laggard, as Carter said, I think that for these really big names, like a Pfizer who's in the hunt and after Zeneca, I think there's so much pressure on them.
NEUT32|If they do have a vaccine to charge very little for it, unlike Moderna who seems to be interested in maximizing the profit potential.
NEUT33|And that's fine, we need a vaccine.
NEUT34|I think that the other big drug companies will face more pressure, so you know, I would be either in.
NEUT35|"The FBI or the IBB if you wanted to have exposure to the drug companies or the biotech companies."""
