BULL0|"""Hello guys and girls, hope you're doing very well guys."
BEAR1|My apologies for yesterday not pushing the video through because I had really bad sore throat and was not feeling well.
NEUT2|Thanks got to them very well so those people who are waiting really hardly for the for me to make a video.
NEUT3|So today I'm here.
NEUT4|I'm making a video.
NEUT5|Those people who are new and watching my video for the first time kindly subscribe to my channel.
NEUT6|If you haven't subscribed yet.
NEUT7|Starting my video with the Gold analysis guys.
NEUT8|As you can see.
NEUT9|Currently it is touched about resistance one I will show you the resistance one lies on 1733.
NEUT10|Before the weekend I did said that it will try to reach 133 or 140.
NEUT11|The maximum sorry 1:20 or 1:30 maximum in my previous video and it did try to reach 133.
BULL12|But because of the resistance area that it has formed it got rejected and it will try once again on.
NEUT13|You know 6th of April.
BULL14|To reach this 133 level, but you know we we need to.
NEUT15|The scalper needs to be take taking care here, that it might not break, because gold is not so strong an in the most cases, you know, the buyers give up when the price goes to go, you know, cross 1733 or that level.
NEUT16|So I would expect you that.
NEUT17|Be cautious and it can change the momentum anytime towards the downward.
NEUT18|But overall I would say that currently on the daily basis, if we change it.
BULL19|On daily basis it has changed its momentum to bearish up to the support one.
NEUT20|But the maximum on daily level which might not be tomorrow, but the maximum that I would expect that it will try to approach 1740 or the maximum which will be around resistance one on daily basis that it might go would be 1745 but for six April my target, the highest target is 1740 and the lowest target will be 1715.
NEUT21|Most of the people might ask me if it's bullish or bearish.
NEUT22|Currently it's it's it's.
NEUT23|It's into a channel trading because when we see I will you know in different momentum I have seen that it is kindly a kind of channel trading.
NEUT24|It's between currently between 1745 and the lowest lowest level is 1700 and the second lowest level is 1678.
NEUT25|So that's why it's very hard to determine but it will try to approach in a bearish moment bullish momentum at this point.
NEUT26|Which is for the six April.
BULL27|It will come down, but it were all the momentum will be bullish on 16.
NEUT28|Sorry six April 2021.
NEUT29|That's all from me.
NEUT30|From trade with him.
BULL31|"I wish you a very."""
