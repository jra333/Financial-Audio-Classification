BULL0|"""This movie is going to be big."
NEUT1|You know there are a lot of people who are waiting for it.
NEUT2|You've got toys that are already on the best toy Christmas list you got, JJ Abrams behind Star Trek Behind Mission Impossible and some other great movies.
NEUT3|I think this is going to be the thing to watch.
BULL4|This offsets the walls at Disney.
NEUT5|I mean ESPN and also the whole you know the cable chording 'cause this offsets that in your mind in mind, not just this movie.
NEUT6|We've got more Marvel movies.
NEUT7|We got more Pixar movies Frozen 2 is coming.
NEUT8|There's a lot of franchise content that's coming.
NEUT9|I gotta minute, I'm so pumped for this thing I didn't.
NEUT10|I hated those other the other three that came out of the middle three.
BEAR11|Yeah, they're horrible.
NEUT12|They were Jar Jar Binks.
NEUT13|What was that?
BULL14|But the first three were so amazing I gotta feeling that they're going to pick up on it.
NEUT15|I'm with you, I've been talking about Disney.
BEAR16|I think it was oversold.
BULL17|I think it's going to come back.
NEUT18|I was.
NEUT19|I was also talking about this Twitter thing last week.
NEUT20|Steve Ballmer took a 4% stake Twitter that start starting to come back on.
NEUT21|We're seeing these, you know, these people who are very successful put their money where their mouths are.
BULL22|I think that's a plus.
NEUT23|You know, you never know.
BULL24|It doesn't guarantee anything, but it is A plus.
NEUT25|Well, I come out a little differently, right?
NEUT26|Twitter was it was beaten to Hell, right?
NEUT27|So what happens?
NEUT28|They have they make Dorsey the official CEO.
BEAR29|They announced layoffs they pre announced.
BEAR30|So when you look at the short interest that they had 46 million shares, the shorts are clearing out.
NEUT31|Now all they have to do when they report their earnings is just explain how we're going to attract new users, how we're going to monetize if you could do that, then I think they're offering so far.
BULL32|That's been a big Dino for it has been a big yes because you can't make this thing cool overnight when it's not cool.
BULL33|I mean, it's good for us.
NEUT34|We like them like information like the news feeds.
BEAR35|But it's not necessarily what the kids are using, and that's where they got to figure this out there on Snapchat, Instagram and those kind of things, the competitive forces absolutely market in general again another session where we open down sharply, lower, finished higher and it feels like the buy on dips.
BULL36|Proud.
BEAR37|Not as big of a pool as it used to be, but we're up three weeks in a row in a down and it's been very quiet without any fanfare effect were a big since all of these smart people were saying the crash is coming.
NEUT38|You know, you know, putting out videos and whatnot.
NEUT39|Are you seeing something here with the quiet stealth moved in this market?
NEUT40|I gotta be honest with you, I see like you know this morning I was catching up on my weekend reading and stuff and I see all these industrial companies.
BEAR41|It's horrible.
NEUT42|Oh, we won't see a turn to 2017 and we're only now really, you know.
NEUT43|Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
NEUT44|And really next week, the belly of the Beast of earnings.
NEUT45|So I am a little concerned as we've had a lot of companies across different industries worn.
BEAR46|And on that note, after the Bell IBM is getting hammered once again.
NEUT47|But again, the perennial losers, the I beams and a caterpillars.
NEUT48|I don't think we think will lead a rally anyway.
NEUT49|No, I don't think the Nikes and a Starbucks in the world continue to go to all time highs almost every day.
BULL50|Thanks a lot Chris.
BULL51|"Appreciate it."""
