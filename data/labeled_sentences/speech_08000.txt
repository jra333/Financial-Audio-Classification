NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|With a very impressive recovery here on Apple, I mean to think that literally just yesterday on Tuesday, the price was all the way down here.
NEUT5|Now then the prices worked its way all the way up there.
NEUT6|Any rational person would say, yeah, that's been a very nice move, but that does little more than valid question of.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of true power behind this president?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of genuine strength, or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat Bounce site move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But you know, in order to answer that question in a very straightforward way in my mind, or revolves around this area.
NEUT11|Right here at 129.
NEUT12|Why is 129 important?
NEUT13|And I'm not saying all this was going to happen, but just for an explanation sake standpoint, let's say the price comes down here to 129 behaves in that manner and then continues on down.
NEUT14|What would that be doing with the price?
NEUT15|Well, that would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out from it.
NEUT16|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power to strength or anything like that.
NEUT17|However, to be fair, no pricing just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner and then start to work to way back upwards.
NEUT18|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there, you have lows down here.
NEUT19|If you envision each one of those stair steps, well, there you go.
NEUT20|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT21|Again, that's the name the game.
NEUT22|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL23|It's going to make progress forward.
NEUT24|And in this situation, quote unquote progress again, being defined as 129.
NEUT25|Now in the event, the price is going to keep on moving upwards, the Big battle ground to watch very, very clearly.
NEUT26|Right now all about that pink line, which on my chart denotes the very one of the very famous 200.
NEUT27|Moving average.
NEUT28|You can see that's already where the prices struggled once.
NEUT29|But the current value of that as well just call it one 3150.
NEUT30|So keep a close eye on that from the resistant side of things.
BULL31|But All in all, any angle you look at it, very impressive movement today.
NEUT32|Not just the question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT33|Let's see what happens.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT36|But it will be me.
NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL38|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT44|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT45|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
