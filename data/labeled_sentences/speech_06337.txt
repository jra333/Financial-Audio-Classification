NEUT0|"""Testing 123 SMF St traders."
NEUT1|Before the opening Bell in the new people on our Free Five day trials, we explain to you about the left elbow gap down and basically on the opening Bell.
BEAR2|This is that left elbow gap down.
NEUT3|Now notice that was made right to the penny to the penny at that teeny line he comes up he takes out half of that bar.
NEUT4|Annie Burns that and once because on the left elbow for you, new people, new MMT potential limites.
NEUT5|Is is that people short that gap down and what the market maker does is he starts to walk that up and till there ain't no more Bart he brought it right up here to that line.
NEUT6|That's a mathematical line that was calculated.
NEUT7|He brought it right so he went from teeny down here to teeny up reversal.
NEUT8|So basically that's what happens on these big left elbows.
BEAR9|The market maker walks that dog against it because the public says oh boy man that thing is going to fall.
NEUT10|Another $15 let me start shorting.
NEUT11|Let me start shorting.
BEAR12|K This is the left elbow gap down on Google.
NEUT13|And that was the clothes bat was right to the teeny line.
NEUT14|He brought it right up to the teeny line in our platform, which is mathematically 100% correct.
NEUT15|It was calculated all the prices before the market opened, and that's the power of understanding how to be a market maker and get those moves on that left elbow and that ones Google.
NEUT16|I will do Apple next and it all, and the time is 728.
NEUT17|We've been open 58 minutes from that left elbow.
NEUT18|Walk that dog and now we're coming back down.
NEUT19|And that tell these left elbows work on these gap downs vice versa.
NEUT20|Say that this would have been a gap way up here.
NEUT21|Well, we would have been shorting it back down.
NEUT22|The public walks away down here, but one just the opposite.
NEUT23|When they have a real big gap up, the public loves the buy and then they take the public down so they make they trade against him here and they always trade against him up on the other side.
NEUT24|And so for you new MMT's that are witnessing this remember talk is cheap.
NEUT25|This is real.
NEUT26|"This is approved and this is exactly how we said it would happen before the opening Bell on that left elbow."""
