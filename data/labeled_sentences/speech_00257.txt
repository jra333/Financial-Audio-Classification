BULL0|"""Welcome back to building wealth."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|In this video I'm going to be sharing a trade set up, something that I am currently playing and just want to share it with.
NEUT3|You also have something that will be beneficial.
NEUT4|Alright, before we begin, I want to point out that I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT5|These are my own thoughts and opinions and these are trade setups I am sharing for educational purposes only.
NEUT6|OK, so looking at Qualcomm on the daily chart we've got a left shoulder head right shoulder, potential head and shoulders.
NEUT7|We have not broken the neckline as of yet.
NEUT8|What we want to do is we want to see a confirmed break.
NEUT9|Which should come down to our.
NEUT10|Target, which is based off of the top of the head to the neckline.
NEUT11|Which will bring us right here when it breaks the neckline down to come on there we go right down to the red, around $95.
BEAR12|So if you look to the left though, there was a major gap up.
NEUT13|What I would most likely do.
NEUT14|Is take a little bit of profit here at the top where the gap was.
NEUT15|And then let the rest run.
BULL16|It will most likely try to close that gap.
BEAR17|My only fear is if we hit here and there's some support, it will most likely bounce, which will eat a lot of the premium off the puts I did.
NEUT18|Go ahead and place a number of puts right up here at the 21 day moving average that was showing as resistance look like a solid place to enter.
NEUT19|If it does take a bouncing comes up over the 118 level.
NEUT20|I'm going to be exiting the trade 'cause that will be invalidating the trade altogether, so we will see how this goes, see where it plays out and hopefully I'll be able to follow along.
