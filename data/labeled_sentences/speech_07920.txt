NEUT0|"""What is a stock market?"
NEUT1|Stock Market is a place for investors to exchange shares or small slivers of ownership in publicly traded companies.
NEUT2|Now it isn't actually a physical place per say, but more interconnected web of exchangers, buyers and sellers.
NEUT3|And at this point it generally takes place in the digital realm.
NEUT4|Now you can have small slivers of ownership from the largest most known companies like Apple and Bank of America which are frequently among the most traded companies on a day to day basis.
NEUT5|Means there's a lot of exchanging going on.
NEUT6|Down to smaller, more obscure companies that trade less frequently now, there as many as 10,000 traded companies listed in the US alone, so there's a lot to choose from and got everything.
NEUT7|Like I said from the biggest and baddest like Exxon and Apple, down to the smaller, more obscure companies.
NEUT8|Now every slice of ownership is going to entitle you to that certain percentage of earnings that that company makes, so that makes your decision about which shares you want to own very important.
NEUT9|So as an investor, you're always trying to buy those shares of those companies that you believe are going to earn much more in the future than they are today.
NEUT10|Or who shares are trading very cheaply to what you believe their earning or what they should be earning now.
