NEUT0|"""I am curious to know you mentioned LA opening a theaters and gyms."
NEUT1|As of today, New York City restaurants.
NEUT2|Jim I think 50%.
NEUT3|Starting Friday I wondered if that's going to pull forward your date.
NEUT4|Your Cinco de Mayo, date of your place.
NEUT5|No no plans were sticking by May we want to get everything right?
BEAR6|I think that the rush to open is a mistake.
NEUT7|I just think that we don't know enough.
NEUT8|Still, we don't know enough about viral load.
NEUT9|We don't know enough about what the real number should be at a bar.
NEUT10|I don't want, I just don't want to be involved with anything that we don't know that we have so few facts on.
NEUT11|But then again, that's been that's been the state of this thing the whole way.
NEUT12|Hasn't Carl?
NEUT13|How little we've really known each time incrementally think we, you know, we don't?
NEUT14|We look back now and think hands surface wash. Well, that was certainly a part of it, but it was this.
NEUT15|It was the idea that we all yell.
NEUT16|But then again I mean there were 3000 people last night watching the 76ers game.
NEUT17|We're starting to hear about about stadiums that are going to be.
NEUT18|For opening day, right for Baseball, Texas is going to be filled, I think.
NEUT19|Well, how do you feel about that?
NEUT20|You want to go to that game?
NEUT21|Are you going to have all your servers wear masks?
NEUT22|I mean from now till whenever your waiters and bartenders will be wearing masks.
NEUT23|Yeah I mean well guys.
NEUT24|New York Post New York Post has a great story this morning about Vegas which did go to 50%, and I mean the money quote is I couldn't even get into the Bellagio parking lot.
NEUT25|I do notice Jim MGM is the second biggest SMP Gainer today up six and a half, but it is remarkable how people are again want to travel and want to go?
NEUT26|And now Wynn has done remarkable work in terms of trying to figure out exactly what the safest way to do it is.
NEUT27|I wish restaurants would do the same thing.
NEUT28|There is a Japanese way the Japanese have figured out.
NEUT29|How to make it so that there's very little communicable disease in restaurants, but our country is just kind of catches catch, can governors deciding things that governors dot?
NEUT30|Are they really capable of making decisions?
NEUT31|What do they know?
NEUT32|I mean, I just think Carl that it unless you really vetted this thing with scientists.
NEUT33|And there are scientists who would say listen, there's some things that are not safe.
NEUT34|I mean look airlines are safe because they keep recirculating the air and yet they were the ones that were.
NEUT35|Fingered as being the most dangerous, so I find that when you go in and in a room and people are screaming that's just not safe.
NEUT36|I don't want to be in that room alright, but when I when we saddle up to the bar at Portion Gil yes on the 5th of May yes and I start down in tequila right and Carl's with me and we're all together.
NEUT37|That's going to be fine, right?
NEUT38|Well, it's going to be by invitation only because I'm trying to figure out how to do this.
NEUT39|OK, and David David unlike a lot of other things.
NEUT40|Like why wouldn't doors will be wide open?
NEUT41|Like I wouldn't give you the olive oil, I'll give you the invite here.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
