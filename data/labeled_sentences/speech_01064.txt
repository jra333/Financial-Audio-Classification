NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|My friends, my name is Moses.
NEUT2|If you need to the channel I like posting about things that I find interesting and at any point you find something in this video that's interesting to you, please feel free to let me know by hitting that like button.
BULL3|It's greatly appreciated on my end.
NEUT4|Today we're going to be talking about General Electric you don't know too much about General Electric.
BULL5|General Electric is an industrial company and they have been around for quite some time, but just like any other company in the world, they do have their peaks and valleys and right now they're actually recovering from a massive downturn in the company.
NEUT6|They recently got a new CEO and this CEO, in my opinion is working wonders for the company.
NEUT7|This company is a company that overtime they have accumulated a lot of debt and now that this new CEO is in place, he is focused on making that company move forward.
BULL8|He's focused on paying off a lot of the companies debt over time, which is very, very beneficial.
NEUT9|Not only that, he's also trimming the fat off the company.
BEAR10|So what I mean by that he's actually cutting off a lot of the things with the company that have been very cost effective that aren't producing a lot of money.
BULL11|And with that money you can then use it to improve the company itself.
NEUT12|Now they just recently announced A8 for one reverse back split.
NEUT13|If you don't know what a stock split is, let me give you this example.
NEUT14|Apple.
NEUT15|Pretty recently they announced over a couple months back this already happened.
NEUT16|Apple announced a stock split, So what Apple did is for everyone stock an investor had.
NEUT17|They gave that investor.
NEUT18|They split that investors position into four.
NEUT19|So if you had.
NEUT20|100 shares of Apple.
NEUT21|It then got split into 400 shares at a lower price that reflect those lower shares or those more shares I should say.
NEUT22|Anyways, the opposite.
NEUT23|Is a reverse stock split, so in this particular situation, General Electric is proposing 8 for one reverse stock split for every eight shares you have, they're going to combine it into one that's going to make the price seem higher, but in reality it's just those shares being combined.
BULL24|That is very beneficial for investors in the sense that it provides the market with less supply.
NEUT25|It gives the stock more room to breathe.
NEUT26|Right now.
NEUT27|General Electric is also a stack that has a lot of shares issued.
NEUT28|I believe it's like 5 billion.
BEAR29|Or actually I think it's like 8 billion shares that are issued in the market and a for one split would knock that supply down to 1 billion shares, which still is left but.
NEUT30|It's not nearly as much as a billion.
NEUT31|Now give the stock a lot more room to be a little bit more volatile and pick up on price.
NEUT32|Also.
NEUT33|As far as short term price action.
NEUT34|My prediction this is my prediction alone.
NEUT35|Of course I can be wrong.
BEAR36|My prediction for this stock for the short term is that the announcement of the reverse stock split is going to drive the price down.
NEUT37|Reverse stock split is usually used by companies that are failing.
NEUT38|General Electric is not failing, which is what makes this.
NEUT39|A little bit obscure.
NEUT40|But like I said, my position on this for the long term is that I'm very bullish.
NEUT41|I actually have a position in this company or doing the wheel strategy as we speak.
NEUT42|It's a small position, but I'm just waiting to get a sign because I I am very bullish on General Electric and I think the environment is ripe for General Electric.
NEUT43|If they play their cards right.
NEUT44|If you're considering investing or switching brokerages would highly recommend Weibel.
NEUT45|Their simple, easy to use in there, having excellent offers where if you sign up there giving away free stacks to anybody that signs up.
