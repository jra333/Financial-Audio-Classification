NEUT0|"""It's playing this weird video chart on ticker symbol, AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, now that the dust has settled here on Amazon headed into Wednesday, couple of very key technical levels in areas where a lot of people are watching, so I don't want to come across like I'm some.
NEUT5|I have some sort of special talent, or this is some sort of fantastic discovery.
NEUT6|The exact opposite, I assure you.
NEUT7|People that use charts understand charts are going to be watching these levels.
NEUT8|And the reason I bring that up is because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy caught whatever you want, it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements and the first level here.
NEUT9|That a lot of people will be watching is right here at that level of support.
NEUT10|At the 3193 Mark, and while nothing is guaranteed, my core point here is that it's a more than valid.
NEUT11|It's a more than rational thought to be having that.
NEUT12|If the price were to come down here, behave in that manner and then break to the downside.
BEAR13|That break could very well create that much more additional downside.
BEAR14|Selling pressure.
NEUT15|Again, a guarantee absolutely not a valid rational thought to be having.
NEUT16|Yeah for sure.
NEUT17|So definitely keep a close eye in that area.
NEUT18|That will be a main level of support to watch in the event that level is broken.
NEUT19|Now the next level of support to keep an eye on would be down there, right around the 3160 mark, so keep an eye on those couple areas from the support side of things.
NEUT20|As far as areas of resistance are concerned, he loved to watch is going to be the purple line up there.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|Simple moving average currently valid it.
NEUT23|Let's just call it 3277.
NEUT24|So 3277 will be that initial main level.
NEUT25|If there is any sort of attempted balances, but the levels that I find most intriguing are those levels of support moving forward.
NEUT26|So let's see how things continue to play out and see if the price is actually going to get a nice little bounce from that area, or if that could lead to some more bearishness.
NEUT27|With the breakdown of it, so we'll see how this all plays out on Wednesday.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT40|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
