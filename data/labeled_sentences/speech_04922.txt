NEUT0|"""Want to get rid of Jerrod Blicker?"
NEUT1|Because Jared news broke yesterday and now Amazon is moving on it that Amazon is in talks with Simon property, which owns a bunch of malls across the country.
NEUT2|To turn some JCPenney and Sears locations that are going to be going under that are going to be closing into fulfillment centers.
NEUT3|Kind of ironic, right?
NEUT4|I mean, Amazon was always sort of seen as the killer of the malls.
NEUT5|I guess yeah, I guess you could say the cycle is complete right now.
NEUT6|They have to do something with that space and it doesn't seem to me that this would be ideal because it's not going to bring in additional foot traffic to the mall.
NEUT7|Not very much, but you got to put something in there so this is going to be about through 74 stores nationwide in both Penny and Sears.
NEUT8|And we'll see how it works out.
NEUT9|It's Amazon's coming to everybody's mall.
NEUT10|Alright Chris, what do you think about that?
NEUT11|Move by Amazon doesn't make sense to you.
NEUT12|It looks like you know, Amazon just continues to have world ********** here.
NEUT13|Listen, I think I think not even specifically Amazon.
NEUT14|I think just just in general the corporate landscape.
NEUT15|Bigger is is really taking the economies of scale dynamic to a whole new level.
NEUT16|And so I think that it makes sense to see large entities began to take bigger toe holds within the the businesses of their traffic or the ancillary businesses in which their their end.
NEUT17|Consumers reside, so I think it just fits this broader theme of concentration.
NEUT18|One that's you know, benefiting capitalization, weighted indices and benefiting sort of efficiencies that come from those economies of scale.
BEAR19|"I don't think that's a trend that's going to dissipate."""
