BEAR0|"""There's got to be some opportunity, I said AbbVie, they've gotta be both look, Walmart is down to don't have enormous amounts of free cash flow that in life their stocks declined by 40 or 50%."
NEUT1|This is why I want to buy Mart.
NEUT2|Necessarily going to be impacted by the recession, but do I want to have one?
NEUT3|Do I want to buy Walmart at 1:15 knowing it traded at 96 in March of last year?

NEUT6|David.
NEUT7|OK, I'm listening.
NEUT8|I'm saying that that could be done a little more.
NEUT9|Why not be price sensitive?

NEUT12|I I said by AbbVie and I'm going to be looking like I like Burke because of what the cancer profiled their drug, but him at Merck.
NEUT13|Is it 79?
NEUT14|It yields three.
NEUT15|It used to be at 92.
NEUT16|I think that's attractive if I want to buy some more by a quarter position.
