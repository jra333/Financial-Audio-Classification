NEUT2|In today's video, I'm going to show you a very simple way to import stock data into your power BI model.
NEUT3|This involves using R, so make sure you have our download on your machine and then it's a very simple process.
NEUT4|So let's go to our studio.
NEUT5|We need to make sure we have installed Git batch, get symbols and once we once we have that library installed, we'll just need to.
NEUT6|Get the SP 500 stocks.
NEUT7|This is a function from batch.
NEUT8|Get symbols and then we'll take the tickers column from that return and then all we have to do is call the batch get symbols function, throw in our list of tickers.
NEUT9|And set a first date and last date.
NEUT10|So this is basically the date range that we want to get data for.
NEUT11|I set it to today minus 365 days and until today.
NEUT12|So basically just give me last year's data for all of the tickers in the S&P 500.
NEUT13|And finally we need to return this result as a dataframe power be I can only accept data frame so we need to make sure that our result is data frame and then for the purposes here I just printed it.
NEUT14|So if you go ahead and run.
NEUT15|Descript, from this portion it might take a little while, but you will get all the data you need, so coming over to power BI we see that we have a bunch of stocks here.
NEUT16|If we go ahead and click on one or a couple, we can see how we have all this data.
NEUT17|Here, let's go ahead and clear all those.
NEUT18|We also have a slicer up here.
NEUT19|We can just type in whichever stocks we want, like Google, Apple, Microsoft going, click filter.
NEUT20|And you have those three tickers, awesome.
NEUT21|So let me show you how I got here.
NEUT22|So all I had to do was enter a fake table here.
NEUT23|I just put in data.
NEUT24|I called the stocks will call this table stocks too.
NEUT25|So now I just have an empty table.
NEUT26|In stocks too, let's edit that query.
NEUT27|So in stocks two, I need to come to transform, run our script.
NEUT28|And from there all I had to do is take this portion, copy it and paste it into the OR script editor.
NEUT29|I threw that in there and once I clicked OK and when closed and applied, my data was already there because it was importing the data as a data frame that looked like this.
NEUT30|So gave us all of the information here along with the ticker symbol.
NEUT31|So with all this stuff with that code you'll be able to get all of the data for all of the S&P 500 stocks.
NEUT32|And just another quick look.
BULL33|This looks awesome.
NEUT34|We can filter based on these tickers and there are 500 acres to choose from, so you get all this data that you want and it was a very simple process.
