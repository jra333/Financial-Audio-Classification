BEAR0|"""Into the final quarter of the year, and it's easy for investors still to be blindsided by geopolitical uncertainty and worries about low inflation."
NEUT1|But how confident is the market right now with with me to discuss this is Luca Paolini or Pictet Asset Management?
NEUT2|Luca, welcome you, have you stop worrying about North Korea and low inflation and things like that.
NEUT3|You very much confident about the market.
BULL4|Well, we have learned in the last few years.
NEUT5|We shouldn't worry too much about political geopolitical risk.
NEUT6|We should focus on growth, will focus on inflation.
BULL7|Central banks, but we know it's a global growth is basically close to 4% is one of the best rates we have seen since since the since 2009.
BEAR8|Consumer confidence close and autumn high and inflation is low, which obviously very supportive for risk assets.
BULL9|So in that sense I think the outlook for the next three to six months is very positive for equity investors and our first chart shows just how confident the market is and how asset prices are responding to that.
BULL10|Yeah, well, we again we can see from the chart is that there is still a strong correlation between.
NEUT11|Global growth group of confidence in markets is not just central banks.
BULL12|If growth is very strong, earnings are going up and then obviously very good for equity investors.
NEUT13|And your second charges is field fashion Misery index which we used to worry about.
NEUT14|But just look how low it is these days and it means that India was very popular in the 70s in a period of circulation.
NEUT15|Just explain what it is.
NEUT16|It's just the sum of the unemployment rate and inflation with ideas that if you have low unemployment and low inflation.
BEAR17|Is very good for for market and actually while you can see here this negative correlation and this also would suggest that even if everybody is worried about valuation, the USN valuation is high.
NEUT18|The misery that would suggest is still a little bit of upside in terms of valuation.
NEUT19|Maybe around 15 or 20% until the end of the cycle.
NEUT20|So there is still a little bit of upside.
BULL21|Definitely US even in valuation.
NEUT22|OK and what's helping that?
NEUT23|Your third chart shows is zero bound policy which coupled with low end.
BULL24|Low unemployment also makes it a good case for investing.
NEUT25|Well.
NEUT26|What you can see in the chart that historically again will you have higher rates when inflation tends to fold.
NEUT27|There is a negative correlation.
BEAR28|Now we're seeing the unemployment rate in the developed markets at an all time low, but you still have exceptionally low interest rates.
NEUT29|This could be seen as a positive and it is for the next three to six months because we don't expect a big change in monetary policy.
BEAR30|But it also risk in the medium term because it's difficult to expect central banks to remain dovish forever.
NEUT31|When you have very solid growth and growth above attention, yes, I was going to.
BEAR32|I mean just finally look, I mean the investors have been very short term for an awful long time.
NEUT33|Is it time to start thinking more medium term about your investment opportunities?
NEUT34|Well, yes and not is always.
NEUT35|I think one of the problems that we have in this industry to be focused too much in the short term.
BEAR36|We are missing the big picture.
NEUT37|The big picture.
NEUT38|Still the business cycle.
BULL39|As long as the business cycle is doing well, equities will do well.
NEUT40|The question mark is though, is how long this business cycle will continue.
NEUT41|We start to see the first indication we are approaching the end of the cycle.
NEUT42|In our view, we still have 1-2 years, so maybe it's a bit too late to be too long term, but I think being too short term I think it's not.
NEUT43|It's never.
NEUT44|I think this solution look cappellini.
BULL45|"Thank you very much."""
