NEUT0|"""Well, anyway, how about this one?"
NEUT1|This is a.
NEUT2|Another Bitcoin related story, but a little bit different.
BEAR3|Wife leaves husband after he refuses to sell Bitcoin at 60K and bought the dip.
BEAR4|It was too much, so there's 60K scared out.
NEUT5|Tomball USD he said, how about I just buy this dip right here, more?
NEUT6|I don't know this is this is a Reddit post which turned into an article in bitcoin.com, so I won't take it for what it is.
NEUT7|According to a post on Reddit.
NEUT8|Username parking meter gave his testimony on how the Bitcoin bull run ended up hurting his marriage.
NEUT9|Here's a quote she just left to go stay at her sisters.
BEAR10|She is super mad that I didn't sell a 60K and looks at the price often scolding me.
NEUT11|I keep telling her we don't need the money and have the cash.
NEUT12|We live nice.
BEAR13|However, today she caught me buying the dip and was so ****** she almost hit me.
NEUT14|Now she packed her bags and went to her sisters to stay.
NEUT15|She said not to talk to her.
NEUT16|Well, that's an interesting one, as so many people have gotten into.
NEUT17|Investing in crypto, you start to wonder about the dynamics in the household as people may be in disagreement, went to buy, went to semi stressful enough on your own.
NEUT18|Yeah, let alone if it's the family savings or something like this that the children's Future Education Fund that you're using to buy the dip.
NEUT19|Yeah, you don't dip into those ones.
NEUT20|Well you have some Peach.
NEUT21|I think some people probably do.
NEUT22|Right, because you look at the games, I mean, you just showed the chart.
NEUT23|There's a lot of FOMO in that chart.
NEUT24|Yeah, follow chart.
NEUT25|It represents FOMO in and of itself.
NEUT26|That's a FOMO chart.
NEUT27|Anyway, I hope these two.
NEUT28|Are able to figure it out and who knows if Bitcoin keeps going up?
NEUT29|"She might just come back, yeah?"""
