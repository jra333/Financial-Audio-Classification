NEUT0|"""Oracle that was a steak that you will suddenly popped up in the third quarter."
NEUT1|That Berkshire had two point, 1,000,000 billion $2.1 billion of Oracle shares at the end of the third quarter.
BEAR2|It went to zero at the end of the fourth quarter, which it's really unusual to see a technology company creep into the Berkshire Holdings like that.
NEUT3|And it's even more unusual to see it flushed out so quickly.
BEAR4|It was that, you yeah, and Larry Ellison is not a fantastic job with Oracle.
NEUT5|I mean, I've followed from the standpoint of reading about it, but I felt I didn't understand the message.
NEUT6|Then after I started buying it, I felt I still don't understand the business.
NEUT7|I actually changed my mind in terms of understanding and not in terms of evaluating it.

BULL14|I'm glad we got out of higher on higher prices in this.
NEUT15|But I I'm not knocking went there, but the whole markets come back.
NEUT16|Markets that are high.
NEUT17|And that doesn't mean I don't mean it said hi and then it's going down something with me.
NEUT18|I mean that it's just tired, tired that's been on now for, well, really, ever.
NEUT19|I mean, we met here 10 years ago the the SMP was at 666 and within a day or two of when we got together.
NEUT20|And and you know, people thought America was washed up and they were afraid of America and what's happened to quadruple and 10 years?
