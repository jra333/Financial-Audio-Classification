BEAR5|Looking at Facebook on the daily and weekly time frame we saw the pattern we're seeing all over the place today that is a gap up off of the bullish momentum seen yesterday.
BEAR6|Thursday, and the Bears absolutely crushing the stock the entire day.
BEAR7|So 10 day moving average support is now resistance.
NEUT8|That level is 9371.
BEAR9|We closed right at the 50 day moving average support of 9277, so that is a must close over on Monday to keep that as support, we do see $92.00 being support on the previous candle sticks, their lows bounced off there as we do.
NEUT10|As we saw today as well, keep your eye on this rsia cross below 50 downward will be bearish and the Middle Bollinger Band Support 9175 is also a must hold.
NEUT11|Level 96 is resistance.
BEAR12|You can see how many times we've rejected from that level in the past couple of months, so close above 96 is bullish.
BEAR13|Anna close below 92 is bearish.
BEAR14|It's as simple as that on the weekly chart we have a bearish reversal Candlestick pattern.
BEAR15|We are maintaining the ten week moving average support of 9242 but if we see a red candle stick next week it will confirm this bearish reversal.
NEUT16|Maggie did not see the Bulls cross.
NEUT17|That was very close to happening and we will see either a green candle stick would make that more likely to happen, or a red candle stick will mean we're coming down to test the Middle Bollinger Band of 8844.
