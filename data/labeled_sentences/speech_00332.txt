NEUT0|"""Well, shares of one company whose CEO we talked to earlier in the week going to the Moon, or was the last week rocket companies is the one I'm talking about."
NEUT1|Brian says, you've got to take on this one, which seems to now be the target of a short squeeze.
NEUT2|Right, Julie.
BEAR3|So for the third straight day, shares of Rocket Company, which is the parent company of Quicken Loans.
NEUT4|That is the hottest trending ticker on the very very very large Yahoo Finance platform and we saw yesterday and I'll tribute this tattoo.
BULL5|The folks at Swaggie stocks a 19% increase in Reddit sentiment on the platform as it pertains to two rocket companies in rocket companies too was also the most watched ticker on that site.
NEUT6|Swaggie stock.
NEUT7|So it's a lot of activity in read it right now.
NEUT8|And it seems to be having got caught up in that sentiment or the short selling sentiment, and I'm not sure why, because the fundamentals of business are very strong and less about 46% of Rocket Company shares are in fact Shorten.
BULL9|That compares a GameStop at about 32% according to S3 Partners data.
NEUT10|But we had asked Rocket companies CEO Jay Farner about this just last Friday after the company reported earnings, how he feels about the short sellers getting involved with his company.
NEUT11|Take a listen.
NEUT12|And so that lifetime value of the client that we're winning each and every day we get to spread over all of those revenue generators, not just one.
NEUT13|And so I think I think the shorts are starting to understand that, and I assume overtime will see fewer and fewer people shorting the stock.
NEUT14|But we're just going to keep doing what we do, which is focused on our platform, focus on our business, focus on great client experience.
NEUT15|And I believe that the rest will kind of take care of itself.
NEUT16|So Miles and Julie, it is bewildering to me why rocket companies has been caught up in Reddit activity and this is coming.
BULL17|That's firing all cells fourth quarter closed loan, origination up 111% net profits up 350% in real business.
NEUT18|Unlike a GameStop.
NEUT19|Dare I stay?
NEUT20|Maybe it's just a cool name, miles maybe the maybe the rain is just like the name rocket.
BEAR21|I, I mean I, I think that's kind of overthinking it.
NEUT22|It's interesting just to hear a CEO.
NEUT23|I think it's always weird when CEO's comment on their stock in general, and I know that you're kind of forced to when you have a huge amount of short interest on the name.
NEUT24|And I know that Elon Musk kind of made it cool.
NEUT25|And like the cliche would be if you talk about the stock that something bad is going to happen.
NEUT26|And now that has been turned on its head because Elon talks about the stock all the time and only amazing things have happened as it relates to Tesla shares.
NEUT27|But I think in the meme market you know you don't have to worry about like.
NEUT28|Owner of the LTV is what are, you know, investors are really appreciating.
NEUT29|You can just say well look some people on Wall Street bets were talking about our Katie.
NEUT30|It's also an emoji, will leave it at that trying to like make it very serious.
NEUT31|CFA level stuff is to me kind of missing the moment but hey I'm sending the cheap seats so I mean you can also say absolutely nothing or you can post a picture of an ice cream cone.
NEUT32|"So there are all kinds of options that are available to people."""
