NEUT0|"""Ben in Minnesota wants to dig a little bit deeper on Amazon."
NEUT1|Hi, my name is Ben.
NEUT2|I'm from Minnesota.
NEUT3|I'm 26 years old and I'm relatively new and investing.
NEUT4|I want to own the best of the best and that's why I want to own Amazon.
BEAR5|The only problem is the stock is run up so much I don't know when the right time to get in is.
NEUT6|When would you feel comfortable and starting to position in Amazon and how should I approach this situation?
NEUT7|Would love to hear your thoughts.
NEUT8|Thank you.
BULL9|Hey Ben, thanks for checking in with us.
NEUT10|I own Amazon, but I probably would not be a buyer right now at this price.
BULL11|I do think that there will be other opportunities.
NEUT12|Typically during the course of a quarter when there's a lack of news, a lack of new developments, you do get that chance where either the general market sells down and Amazon's taken down with it, or what we saw earlier this summer that rotation into other stocks away from tech and people start to use the apples and the Amazons.
NEUT13|A source of liquidity.
NEUT14|So I would wait for those moments.
NEUT15|Rather than paying up at the all time high and the only thing that you risk by doing that is missing out.
NEUT16|But there are plenty of other fish in the sea.
BULL17|"Plenty of other opportunities."""
