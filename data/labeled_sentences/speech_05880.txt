NEUT0|"""The third objective of that program was."
BULL1|If we are able to set up, you know we have the right infrastructure and we have the right capabilities in place.
NEUT2|Can we pilot?
NEUT3|Two use cases to prove that these things make sense going forward, so we have set up two use cases or two.
NEUT4|What we call it use cases.
NEUT5|It's actually 2 business questions we're trying to answer, and the first one is specifically for Barcelona, where we're looking at 18,000 outlets, so an outlet for us could be a bar or restaurant, or could be a traditional store.
NEUT6|Actually, what we're trying to look at is rather than thinking about data we have from the past and analyzing data from the past is more looking at.
NEUT7|If we add a lot more data sources and variables to the outlet, will we have a different view of the potential of the outlet rather than just looking at what we sold in the past kind of extra data is.
NEUT8|So when we're thinking about extra data, this is really it's external data from trip adviser.
NEUT9|It's data from Facebook.
NEUT10|It's around events that take place around these outlets.
NEUT11|It's even weather data, predictions around that, etc.
NEUT12|So we're adding all these external sources.
NEUT13|And then we're looking at a totally different way to these outlets.
NEUT14|Now The thing is where we used to classify our outlets in the past into gold, silver, bronze.
NEUT15|You know, that's the way we visit them.
NEUT16|So we would visit the Golden ones more than the bronze ones.
NEUT17|But what we've seen now is we're looking at the potential.
NEUT18|Is that the pros wants might actually have a bigger potential then then the Golden one.
NEUT19|So the complex thing now is, as we've done the test for the 18,000 outlets.
NEUT20|Is to truly change the way we operate, so embedding the insights into the new business processes is actually the business.
NEUT21|The biggest challenge.
NEUT22|So I think as an idea organization you can easily drive lots of use cases and answer lots of business questions.
NEUT23|"But the business needs to be able to follow in embedding the change into into into the day-to-day operations."""
