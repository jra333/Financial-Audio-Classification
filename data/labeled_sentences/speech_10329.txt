NEUT0|"""And we gotta have nuts, you know, Michelle Goss."
BEAR1|That was a terrible quarter.
BEAR2|It's just terrible holiday season and they don't have a lot of traffic.
BEAR3|Women's hurt them, but they are so bullish on themselves that it's almost kind of like during a parallel universe.
BEAR4|I mean, they are the worst, but if you read the release you think that they had a dynamite quarter dynamite holiday.
NEUT5|So yeah, well, we should tell people comparable store sales for fiscal, November, December 19.
BEAR6|What they call the holiday period were down 2% over the same period last year.
NEUT7|.2% point.
BULL8|2% excuse me, Macy's was good.
BEAR9|Right Macy's and they are at the low end now of their previously announced guidance of 475 to 495, which excludes $0.22 a share in the due to the extinguishment of debt and impairment, store Closings and other costs.
NEUT10|Recognized in the first nine months of the year, we're not going to hear from them until.
NEUT11|March 3rd, so we got a while but Jim this follows what was not a good last quarter.
BEAR12|Of course for calls when we watched the stock decline as well.
NEUT13|Well David, they did this tie up with Amazon, where you can return things to Amazon.
BEAR14|It feels like people return things to Amazon and then ran out of the store.
NEUT15|I just am baffled that they do initiative after initiative and look at this stock now that you have a good balance sheet and they've got a good dividend, the dividend is safe, but Kohl's is just roadkill not unlike yesterday, Walgreens.
NEUT16|Roadkill and we're really getting who's roadkill.
NEUT17|News not compare this to Costco, 9% increase in one month, and Costco is so non they never hide themselves.
NEUT18|They just deliver after deliver after deliver the Kirkland brand.
NEUT19|I know a lot of people, maybe you too David think that is the premium brand.
NEUT20|That's their house brand.
NEUT21|It was remarkable for that stock is that stock is in one week one way collision with 330.
BEAR22|Yeah, Costco December sales are out.
BEAR23|ICB of a now is cutting Kohl's to neutral price target 50 they see something they don't like.
BEAR24|Carl Channel checks is stuck with 75 in April.
NEUT25|Jim well and then largely blaming a women's apparel BAML says that they're going to spend a lot more on promotions in attracting customer traffic.
NEUT26|Look, they're just trying to stay in the game.
BULL27|My Chapel trust had a huge hit when ran.
BEAR28|We kept some that was clearly a mistake.
NEUT29|They don't know what to do.
NEUT30|I mean, their strategy is I need to come into work every day and say anybody got any?
NEUT31|You guys started?
NEUT32|I don't know anything there other company Macy's Jeff Gannett delivered what he said he was going to deliver and he's got an Analyst Day.
NEUT33|He's going to talk a better story.
NEUT34|Coles, I'm speechless, speechless.
NEUT35|Wow, there it is.
NEUT36|You really were speechless for I counted at least points .06 seconds to speech.
