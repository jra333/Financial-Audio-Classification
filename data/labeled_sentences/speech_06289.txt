NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well, I mean that the obvious, but I will anyway just to establish some context here, but very impressive bounce on this one.
NEUT6|I mean something about the fact that at one point the price was literally all the way down there and then by the closing Bell the price had worked its way back up to where it has no game wrong.
NEUT7|There's still work that needs to be done, but the point here being from where the price was to was able to fight back to nice solid move, but that does not bring about the more than valid question of.
NEUT8|But is there any sort of true power behind this woman?
NEUT9|Is there any sort of genuine strength, or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce, type move, and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward, and in my mind it all revolves around a single area, and that area is right here at the 3080 Mark Wise, 3080 important.
NEUT12|I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT13|Let's say the price comes under 3080, behaved in that manner, then continues on down.
NEUT14|What would that be doing to the price at that point?
NEUT15|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where it just wasn't me not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT16|But price movements like go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT17|But I mean to be fair, no price and go straight up.
NEUT18|So maybe the price comes down here behaved in that manner.
NEUT19|Then start to work to way back upwards.
NEUT20|Now have a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here you have that settles down there.
NEUT21|If you envision each one of those as stair steps well hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and again.
NEUT22|That's the name of the game.
NEUT23|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL24|Overtime, it's going to make progress forward, and in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as the 3080 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT25|Main level right now the near term going to be all about that purple line right there with the 50.
NEUT26|Simple moving average.
NEUT27|Currently valid it right there and we'll just call it.
BULL28|The 3111 marks will keep a close eye on that, but like the main dynamic here, is that the price does have a very nice bounce, not just a question of Canada price start to build upon this balance and show signs of progress.
NEUT29|Let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT30|Moving forward.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT33|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR37|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
