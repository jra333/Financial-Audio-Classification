NEUT0|"""And then Kraft Heinz."
NEUT1|This comes in from David Hall.
BULL2|He says Mr Buffett, while Kraft Heinz continues to whittle down their total debt, do you feel that the current dividend payout is appropriate?
BULL3|Or should it be reduced further to free up more cash flow to reduce debt more rapidly?
NEUT4|And I think crafting should pay down its debt and it should, but I think.
NEUT5|Under present circumstances, it appears that it can pay the dividend and pay down debt at a reasonable rate, and it has too much debt, but it doesn't have some.
NEUT6|It doesn't have that it can't pay down and.
NEUT7|This.
NEUT8|The debt holders are going to get the interest and the dead should come down here by year and I think it will and I think it can with the president.
NEUT9|But who knows for sure in the future, Theofilos writes in a similar question and says, do you still believe in the company and management at Kraft Heinz?
NEUT10|It's still a great business in the sense that it earns, will say $5 billion after depreciation, pre tax on 7 billion of tangible assets.
NEUT11|It uses about 7 billion of fixed assets.
NEUT12|That doesn't know that working out well, I mean.
BEAR13|It's a very valuable business, but we paid too much for confirming for craft and we we took on more debt than that.
NEUT14|"But we paid too much."""
