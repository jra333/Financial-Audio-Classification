NEUT0|"""Why do investors buy negative yielding bonds?"
NEUT1|Governments around the world have recently got into the habit of issuing negative yielding debt, essentially borrowing money from investors and asking to be paid for it.
NEUT2|The total value of bonds with negative yields is now estimated at around $13 trillion.
NEUT3|Buying such debt and holding it to maturity is a guaranteed way of losing money.
NEUT4|So who is buying it and why?
BEAR5|Some investors, such as banks, pension funds, and insurers, are compelled to buy the less attractive debt due to various regulations.
BEAR6|They are therefore forced to swallow the negative rates.
NEUT7|Other investors are buying out of pure desperation.
BEAR8|When looking at how poorly other forms of fixed income have performed, they are prepared to take a guaranteed small loss on the bonds rather than risk a much big one elsewhere.
NEUT9|The final set of investors are much cannier.
NEUT10|They sense a way of actually making money.
BULL11|Some are buying the debt of foreign countries and hoping that currency movements will turn their negative, yielding bonds into profitable returns.
BULL12|Others hope that negative yielding debt bought from governments that suffer deflation will actually produce positive real or inflation adjusted returns in the long term.
BEAR13|Finally, bond yields move inversely to prices and some investors believe that yields will actually fall further, meaning the price of the bonds they hold will rise and they can make a capital gain by selling them.
BEAR14|"But for less adventurous investors, the mounting piles of negative yielding bonds are anything but positive."""
