NEUT0|"""Tonight we're giving You Tube shorts ago or basically, AMC is up to date."
BEAR1|This is fantastic and I think that today was a push that we really needed a lot of people are following AMC and recently the share price has been quite flat.
NEUT2|If we look at how this one has been moving over the past two or three days, obviously about 3 days ago we had this candle stick to the red.
BEAR3|The week was coming down pretty low and we can see that the share price plummeted by a rather large amount.
BULL4|Now yesterday the share price was ever so slightly in the green we did pull ourselves up.
BEAR5|We still did have quite a low week on the candle stick.
BULL6|We can't see how we opened up today was pretty fantastic, opening much higher than yesterday now.
BULL7|Ultimately at close we didn't move by too much, so that is significant as well, but ultimately I think that today's moves are a step in the right direction and today is a push that we needed.
NEUT8|It really is putting us on the track for what we need to see.
NEUT9|So the question is, will AMC continue to grow into tomorrow?
NEUT10|Well, make sure to watch our full analysis video on the channel, but I think we might be making shorts a bit more often.
NEUT11|Thank you.
NEUT12|"See you soon."""
