NEUT0|"""Other countries have a value added tax, which is a super sales tax, so we're going to be make the same mistake they made when countries put inviati's of the European stood in the early 70s, their growth rates sharply declined from that of that they had before, so they so level playing field in their minds is make the same mistake they made dumb thing, but that's why they're defending this because they say 100 countries have either a border adjustment tax or VAT tax."
NEUT1|We're just playing catch up 100 a hundred countries.
NEUT2|Bring up a bridge that we do that too.
NEUT3|It's kind on you.
NEUT4|That's their pushback by playing catch up this whole notion, and it's clearly a talking point.
NEUT5|They're using across this board of a level playing field level playing field.
NEUT6|For who for companies or for individual consumers, the Democrats could have a field day with this and all of the talking points that you were just talking about saying you're going after the average person you know.
BULL7|Raise prices of automobiles going to raise prices of all the things that we're consuming all the time.
NEUT8|So who is the level playing field helping?
NEUT9|Yeah, the vieti, the value added tax super sales tax in Europe slams consumers, especially since the hidden tax.
NEUT10|This is a hidden tax.
BULL11|It's going to slam consumers and they think that's going to grow the economy.
BULL12|They think that's going to get Trump's 4% growth rate next year.
NEUT13|It's preposterous.
NEUT14|These people.
NEUT15|I don't know what Kool-aid they're drinking.
BEAR16|Maybe the EPA ordered that water drinking the retail sector is as angry and up in arms about this as is the automakers, because the retailers as well, they've got fabrics coming in from across the world.
NEUT17|They go over the border.
NEUT18|They can have the fabrics come in.
NEUT19|That's one time over the border.
NEUT20|Go back to make the item, then another time over the border.
NEUT21|So again retailers will raise prices on their items.
BEAR22|They have to then look at the margins in the retail industry there razor thin as it is and we're seeing headlines every day about another store closure.
NEUT23|Bankruptcies, the retail industry's already taken it on the chin.
NEUT24|Now you take a lot of profit away.
NEUT25|They're going to be screaming bloody murder, not the voters.
NEUT26|OK, So what do we do though?
BEAR27|I mean, we understand the negative side of a border adjustment tax.
NEUT28|But the Republicans are going with it.
NEUT29|That's in their plan.
NEUT30|They're going to have another fight the way they had in healthcare.
NEUT31|Well, they're going to discover their caucus when they go out and start to when peep sales tax they're going to come back and say, what are you doing?
NEUT32|And so you're going to have the same split and faxes that chat on health care and the White House should just practice a Humane act.
BEAR33|"And that is just to say this is off the table another time."""
