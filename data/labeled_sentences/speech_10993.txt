BULL0|"""Hey guys I'm loving you."
BULL1|Q4 result is on 1st of March, new posted another good month of higher deliveries.
NEUT2|I don't know why this is going down.
BULL3|I believe it's a great opportunity to add more new shares.
BULL4|Will have added thousand more becaused knew posted another good month of higher deliveries in January 2021 and although the electric vehicle form will release its fourth quarter earnings on 1st of March, it's January deliveries shows that new stock is still undervalued.
BULL5|For example, new said that it delivered 7225 EV's in January, which was 352% above.
BULL6|Moreover, this represents a three point 1% growth even over December with 707 deliveries.
NEUT7|Nonetheless, I estimated at least one 35,000 vehicle will be delivered this year.
BULL8|An that is up by 229% over last year, once the company posted its Q4 on 1st March.
NEUT9|Then I will update this forecast, but for right now I estimate that the revenue will be 7.569 billions in 2021.
BULL10|At least I'm getting closer to the analyst average revenue estimated of 4.9 billion for 2021 according to Seeking Alpha.
NEUT11|Meanwhile, my prior revenue forecast was 9.2 billion for 2021.
NEUT12|The upcoming Q4 and 2020 earnings release will be able to help me see what the average price per EV.
BULL13|Has been nearly is up almost 1000% in past year and the current market value of 88.86 billion.
NEUT14|Neo stock is at nearly twelve time U.
NEUT15|By my estimates of 7.569 billion in sales this year.
BULL16|I believe that after first March Q4 we will see a huge upside in this.
NEUT17|That's why I have already added thousand more shares.
NEUT18|China Auto Home website reported that Neo is now in the last stages of testing its new second generation battery swapping stations.
BULL19|The company accepts to begin deploying the stations in April.
NEUT20|I don't seen you as a car company I bought new because of battery swapping stations.
NEUT21|Its market cap is more than food because of its battery swapping.
NEUT22|According to Kathy, would news, roughly 200 battery swap stations have become a key part of its overall business.
NEUT23|Buyers of Neo can choose to buy the vehicle without a battery pack, which lowered the purchase price and opt for a subscription to the battery swap service, which gives new ongoing revenue after the vehicle sales.
BULL24|The new second generation stations can handle more vehicles.
NEUT25|Per day.
NEUT26|Then you current station and can complete the swap operations in less time than the roughly 3 minutes required at the current stations.
BULL27|"The company hopes to have 500 of its new stations up and currently running in China by the end of this year."""
