NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up guys right here with another video for money Mondays found another roller coaster week in the financial markets, so let me quickly summarize what exactly has happened."
BEAR1|The Dow Jones and the S&P 500 posts a week losses of 8% after posting record highs just three weeks earlier.
NEUT2|This is suggested.
BEAR3|I'm going to enter into bear market territory after 11 year Bull Market run on Thursday.
BEAR4|The Dow Jones posted a loss of 10%.
NEUT5|Let me put it a little bit context for you.
BEAR6|That's the largest daily loss since 1987.
BEAR7|However, these losses soon turn around on Friday.
BULL8|The Dow Jones surged up, another 9% showing volatile markets.
BEAR9|This expected volatility in the markets of the next 30 days is expected to be at levels near that only seen in the 2008 financial crisis.
NEUT10|With all that, I want to use this video to explain how I'm investing my money in these turbulent times.
NEUT11|I've gotten my expenses.
NEUT12|I use my savings to invest in two main areas.
NEUT13|The first error I have missed him is index funds.
NEUT14|I use Vanguard to invest in the vrio index, and this is a fund that tracks the S&P 500, giving you the diversification of investing in 500 companies without actually having to invest in 500 companies separately.
BULL15|And historically, the SP 500 has had annual returns of 6% adjusted for inflation with dividends reinvested.
NEUT16|With this I invest on a consistent and regular basis and only invest for the long term.
NEUT17|This is Money that I don't plan on spending or needing for.
NEUT18|Next 10 to 15 years.
BEAR19|So any short term dips in the financial markets don't matter as I don't plan to cash out anytime soon.
NEUT20|Now there has been a lot of talk about using strategies such as investing in gold or shorting the market, but these seem like unnecessarily complicated and risky strategies for most people and therefore I don't follow these.
NEUT21|My second investment strategy is building up my emergency funds.
NEUT22|I usually aim to have at least enough money to cover my expenses for a 12 to 18 month period and with that money I usually invest into a high interest rate savings account.
NEUT23|I'm currently using HSBC, which offers a 1.85% annual return risk free.
NEUT24|As you can see, I try to keep my investment.
NEUT25|She's very simple.
NEUT26|One investing money into S&P 500 Index and to building up my emergency funds and investing this into a high interest rate savings account without being said who you guys have enjoyed the video.
