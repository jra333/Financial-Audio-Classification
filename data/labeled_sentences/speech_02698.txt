NEUT0|"""I want you to filter disinflation into what yield does?"
NEUT1|Is it just about a demand for paper price up forcing yield down?
NEUT2|Well, look, I think that there's a whole variety of things that goes into bond yield determination.
NEUT3|You know the expectations on the Fed and real rates inflation expectations.
NEUT4|Obviously both very large.
NEUT5|I'm in the camp that thinks that we're probably caught that in a range.
NEUT6|I'm always amazed that people think the 10 years going to break above 1% go back to 2% at only.
NEUT7|That's going to happen.
BEAR8|I think that there's still going to be globally a downward pull on Treasury yields.
BEAR9|Because I think inflation expectations, given the size of the Outlook app are going to come down over time.
NEUT10|And at the same time, if you're taking a look around the world, you take a look at the average AAA yield.
NEUT11|It's barely above 0, and in the US you know you get at least you know 70 or 80 basis points, so you know it's a in the land of the blind.
NEUT12|The One Eyed Man is King and I still think Treasurys offer very good value on a relative basis.
NEUT13|Italian, I think what you're saying is really, really important.
NEUT14|It's about the post Covid world and determining defining what is normal and many people seem to think that post covid with a vaccine Treasury or to have no business South of 1%.
NEUT15|You pushing back against that David.
NEUT16|Well, I am pushing back against that because you know what's your expectation of what the Fed is going to be doing?
NEUT17|I mean ultimately your forecast the 10 year yield has to be some scrolled expectation of what short term it's going to be doing over a certain horizon.
NEUT18|The feds already told you that you know they're not going to start to raise rates until inflation gets above 2%.
BULL19|Well, wait a long time for that and for us to return to full employment.
NEUT20|And that's gonna take a long time as well.
NEUT21|On top of that, look.
BULL22|There's no doubt that we're going to get a couple of quarters of pent up demand release.
NEUT23|Once a vaccine is broadly distributed, that's going to happen.
NEUT24|You know which exactly quarter is going to happen next year?
NEUT25|I mean, who knows?
BULL26|But it's going to happen, so we're going to get a couple of quarters of pent up demand release.
NEUT27|And then what does the World Post code would look like after that?
NEUT28|And we never got the inflation from 09 to 2019 despite all the stimulus.
NEUT29|Despite the Fed, you know, the reality is that the same thing the fundamental secular developments have nothing to do with kovit that brought us to low flation and low interest rates and low growth Asian demographics.
NEUT30|Well, how is that changed and monumental debts so you can have the reinharts on?
NEUT31|Well, we'll talk about then.
BEAR32|I hope how these massive run up and deficits and debts.
BEAR33|Going to be dealing with those resolving those are going to be a huge constraint in aggregate demand for years to come.
NEUT34|How are you going to get information out of that?
BULL35|So we're going to get a bump in growth.
BEAR36|Bond yields may go up 2530 basis points and then I'm going to come right back down again because the same fundamental fundamental forces that brought us down 200 basis points on the 10 year notes in the last cycle.
BEAR37|"Are going to be the same forces that drive yields back down towards 0 David X number of years."""
