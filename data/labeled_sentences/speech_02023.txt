NEUT0|"""Erin Kennedy here today with Sarah Hobin."
NEUT1|Our stock of the day is clean energy fuels, clean energy fuels.
NEUT2|Shares are taking it on the chin today after reporting fourth quarter earnings yesterday what happened?
BEAR3|So I think when investors are focusing on is that top line growth for the quarter seems like a miss compared to last year.
BEAR4|Last year's numbers included a one time bump and so that's making for a tough comp.
BULL5|But overall revenues up for the full year 2013 versus 2012 volumes are up and so.
BULL6|It actually looks like a good quarter.
NEUT7|So what do you see in the pipeline for clean energy fuels?
BULL8|Yeah, so basically this compressed national natural gas is building out across the US and now they're starting to make foreign deals as well, so we're seeing big contracts with Dallas public Transit, Long Beach Public transit, some smaller infrastructure building deals around the country.
BULL9|Like in Lancaster, PA. And now we're seeing bigger deals with Russia and China, so all good things so.
BEAR10|The last year, it's really underperformed the market and shares are obviously suffering today.
NEUT11|Do you like this stuff going forward?
NEUT12|I do.
BULL13|I think that we've seen a slower start than maybe we expected, but with the abundance of natural gas and with the focus on cleaner energy, I think clean energy fuels is has management's focus in the right place and it's looking good for the long term.
NEUT14|"That's our stock today and we'll see you next time."""
