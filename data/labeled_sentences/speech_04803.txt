NEUT0|"""There should be a decent number 100 were at 100,000."
NEUT1|A little bit of the low end of the range, but that's about in line.
NEUT2|That's fine.
NEUT3|Yeah, exactly.
NEUT4|They really.
NEUT5|The markets going to focus in on the average hourly earnings number because we're so concerned about what may be happening with inflation.
NEUT6|Where is it?
NEUT7|It's all about inflation at this point, it's all about the Fed and with the tenure reciting at 3%, we know if you get an upside print in which the year over year rate could be the two, 9 to 3% range, which would imply a pretty big beat.
NEUT8|That's a reason to test, you know, the highs of three.
NEUT9|You know three 10311 on 10 years.
BULL10|Now we're expecting 3/10, which would give you basically a year over year number that's unchanged, although it could round up to two point 8%.
NEUT11|So right now it's 27.
BULL12|It could round up to 28.
NEUT13|What would the Fed do?
BEAR14|Do you think that's going to keep my number if the number came in stronger than expected?
NEUT15|We're still looking for a rate hike no matter what comes up tonight.
NEUT16|We September priced December.
NEUT17|You're at.
NEUT18|Let's call it 60% at the moment.
NEUT19|You have to pry some more.
NEUT20|You have to price out.
NEUT21|December Deer started yes starting March 2 March of next year you have to be more confident in the feds hiking path.
NEUT22|If you get this strong wage growth that you know at this point you're getting there 7/10 below, where the Fed is in the narrow, so there's evidence of nonlinearities in the Phillips Group.
NEUT23|Evidence of non so when you get married when you get when you get this far down below the like the natural rate of unemployment, inflation and wage growth can accelerate.
NEUT24|There's some evidence that there's something you can see.
BEAR25|You can see inflation spike up because it's so hard to find workers.
NEUT26|There is debatable when he sends, it did.
NEUT27|They are looking to hire.
BEAR28|I think I heard a number today that more than 50% of companies say it's the hardest market to find perspective employees that they've they've ever on.
NEUT29|Almost every metric that we look at and at the Fed looks at the labor market is tight.
BEAR30|You know that you can argue one or two things here that show signs of excess slack, but remember this is an aging demographic and people are retiring and we need to replace him with workers.
NEUT31|And that's absolutely the case, Sir.
NEUT32|Let's talk about what this means from the markets perspective.
NEUT33|If we get a hotter than number than expected inflation number, will that be?
BEAR34|A big negative for stocks today.
NEUT35|That's hard to say, but what I think is really important is the shift in the market to degree value.
BULL36|Stocks have a chance to really outperform.
BULL37|They tend to be correlated with rising interest rates globally, and what we know is that we've moved in monetary policy tomorrow to tightening from accommodative.
NEUT38|That's happening just about everywhere.
BULL39|Much accelerated in the US, so that gives these more undervalued stocks a chance to really shine, because their growth counterparts.
NEUT40|The discount rate on those long duration stocks where much of the cash flows will be delivered far in the future.
BULL41|The discount rate goes up.
BEAR42|Those stocks usually get hit harder.
NEUT43|We've seen technology leading the way for an awfully long time.
NEUT44|You know, I think we're due for a shift in leadership.
BULL45|At this point, there's some tech stocks that may continue, but it's the rest of the market, and getting this is a global phenomenon that should have a chance to do quite well.
NEUT46|And you're talking beyond just the financials here, far beyond industrials Telecom, the beleaguered telecommunications stocks all the areas that have been left behind.
NEUT47|At some point time someone will say oh, look at those enormous dividend yields in those low multiples.
NEUT48|Maybe I have to wait a little longer, but it's worth it now.
NEUT49|Are you telling people to go ahead and start nibbling now rather than to wait a little while?
BULL50|So, absolutely, we've been very, very encouraging with our clients, saying please look at value stocks because after this very long growth run, it's time the value the growth to value premium is at an extreme, so growth stocks are very expensive at pre global financial crisis.
NEUT51|"Highs"""
