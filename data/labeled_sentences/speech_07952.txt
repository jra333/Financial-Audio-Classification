NEUT0|"""Market capitalization, or as we say in the biz market cap, is one of my favorite basic financial statistics."
NEUT1|It's the price tag on every company.
NEUT2|How do you obtain it?
NEUT3|You simply take the number of shares of a given stock times that price per share that you see in the newspaper or that you just quoted online.
NEUT4|So when you take the price of the stock and multiply by all the shares out there, you now have the value of that company.
NEUT5|Let's take a quick example 100,000,000 shares outstanding.
NEUT6|The stock is at $5 a share.
NEUT7|Let's do the math together.
NEUT8|5 * 100,000,000 is $500 million.
NEUT9|That means that company, which is priced at $5 a share, is actually worth half a billion dollars.
NEUT10|Now, once you start understanding market cap, you start seeing the world differently.
NEUT11|You start seeing in terms of large caps.
NEUT12|Medium caps, Midcap companies, small caps and micro caps.
NEUT13|You start seeing you know companies that have $50 billion or more.
NEUT14|"Those are really large companies and we would call those large caps right on down."""
