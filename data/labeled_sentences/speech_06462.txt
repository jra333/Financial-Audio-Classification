NEUT2|I'm going to look at all of gold market.
BEAR3|The follower chart zooming into the charnel prices are declining in Ichimoku cloud over the last sessions, falling below them bearish cross within the 20 and four Smas.
BEAR4|Also, this tactic oscillator down here is halted near there were sold zone.
BEAR5|While there is size falling towards the 30 level.
BEAR6|If the price continues, the bearish move emitted support is coming from a three eight point 2% Fibonacci retracement level of the upward movement from 12175 to 1400.
NEUT7|Three nine near 13176.
BEAR8|More losses could lead the Elemental until the 50% Fibonacci around 13157.
BULL9|On the other side, the 1400 psychological Mark Mark could attract traders and tension before flirting with the bearish cross of the Smas near 1400 oh, eight.
BULL10|Above these levels that price could meet the latest high of 14124.
BULL11|However, for assumption of the last month, bullish rally gold prices would need to build a six year high or 14139.
