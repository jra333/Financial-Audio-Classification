BEAR0|"""I want to start with technology because as we just talked about we have seen some big blowups this week in the tech industry that have taken down the NASDAQ to some extent."
NEUT1|At least one of them is in your portfolio.
NEUT2|Facebook's in your portfolio.
NEUT3|Amazon is to a little more happily for you.
NEUT4|What do you make of the action that we have seen and that there has been some bleed through to the rest of the market, but it hasn't really taken everything down.
BEAR5|Well actually, I'm pretty happy about Facebook's decline as well when the stock got hit.
NEUT6|We had it in the portfolio, but on the IPO sold it bought it back but it wasn't a really big position.
BEAR7|And then when it got hit in the spring when Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before Congress, it fell down from roughly 190 down to about 1:50 and we added the position pretty significantly.
BEAR8|Then it went up 45% and now it's back down 20%.
NEUT9|So it's above where we were, but we took the yesterday and today to top it off a little bit so it's only 17 times next year's earnings and it trades at about four multiple points in enterprise vibe below Coca Cola.
BEAR10|Which is going to have a hard time growing 6%.
NEUT11|Yeah, an Facebook on what we think are conservative numbers.
NEUT12|Even if those numbers are correct, margins down growth rates down there, doing that deliberately.
NEUT13|By the way, they're still going to 25% a year, so basic gist is just that.
BULL14|It's cheap and that regardless of whether maybe growth is plateauing a little bit or it got to spend more money on moderation, you're getting a deal.
NEUT15|Absolutely absolutely.
NEUT16|It was interesting.
NEUT17|Mark Zuckerberg was interviewed, interviewed a few weeks ago, and the moderate are the interviewer said.
NEUT18|You have an objective every year of project and last year was like Learning Mandarin a couple of years ago.
BEAR19|What is it this year and he said to fix Facebook and I thought you know, if we know what was coming, that was probably part of what he had in mind, which is there's been a lot of issues and they've been struggling to keep up with things they're going to spend.
BULL20|You know, another billion dollars plus on on security and safety, and I think that's a good thing and that repair effort may create more opportunities as well.
NEUT21|Do you think it's easier or harder to find value as the bull market ages?
BULL22|I mean, we're now past the nine year Mark.
NEUT23|Does that make it easier?
NEUT24|Harder, it all depends.
NEUT25|It's harder typically because as the bull market ages people have been had a long time to pick things over.
NEUT26|They've got things sorted out so the stuff which is obviously good and growing usually trades at a pretty expensive multiple.
NEUT27|This markets been a little bit different because for the first several years it was a flight to safety.
BEAR28|It was fear, but fear of risk for volatility, and so the bond surrogates like utilities and consumer staples got way overpriced.
BULL29|Those have come back in yet, but we don't think they're still attractive and in other areas that there are quite attractive financials I think are still good.
BULL30|I think airlines are really good.
BULL31|I think home builders are really good and selected tech.
BULL32|"I mean Amazons are biggest position but Amazon's got a huge runway ahead of it and a lot of growth in the future."""
