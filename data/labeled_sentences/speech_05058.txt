BULL0|"""Good evening Dan Fitzpatrick."
NEUT1|Here at stockmarketmentor.com on Thursday, January 10th and just a quick reminder, the high Octane Options Workshop.
NEUT2|It's an online streaming course or streaming online.
NEUT3|Course is on Saturday.
NEUT4|That's the day after tomorrow, and I want you to just go.
NEUT5|You can just go to the homepage of stock market Mentor or option market mentor.com.
NEUT6|And get the sign up information.
NEUT7|I would tell you that seats are going fast, so reserve yours before they're all taken.
NEUT8|But since it's an on line course, guess what?
NEUT9|There's room for everybody, but I still think you need to take it all right?
NEUT10|How's that for some slick sales?
NEUT11|OK, look Netflix, this is a stock.
BEAR12|It looks like it's pretty overbought.
NEUT13|It looks like you don't want anything to do with it, right?
NEUT14|Well, not so fast horshack, because if you just kind of zoom out you can see what's happening.
NEUT15|This has been it's, you know, this was a different deal here, but it's been in a basing pattern for quite awhile.
BEAR16|And it's just starting to drift higher.
NEUT17|If you look at the red line here, that's a 50 day moving average.
NEUT18|It's really just a nice.
BULL19|It's in a nice uptrend.
NEUT20|We've got this this bullish crossover awhile back between the 50 and the 200 day moving average depending on the steepness of the 200 day moving average versus the 50 day moving average, this can actually be more of a cell signal than a buy signal 'cause it just kind of happened so late here.
NEUT21|That's really not the case because, again, if you just zoom out, you get a better sense of the price action and where this stock is.
NEUT22|Relative to where it was before the bonehead decided that he was going to split up the business and basically give you less for more.
NEUT23|And you don't get your DVD's and all that stuff so bad.
NEUT24|Deal companies still really, you know.
BULL25|Basically recovering from that, but if you just use the 20 day moving average as a reference for buying, then you're going to be fine on this one.
NEUT26|I would suggest though you know you look at 100 bucks is resistance.
NEUT27|That's where it is right now.
NEUT28|But just buy buy the dips.
NEUT29|Buy these pull backs when they get closer to the 20 day moving average and I think it's OK to start scaling in now if you're late on this stock.
NEUT30|It's really OK. Just again, make sure you have a longer term time horizon.
NEUT31|Slide the chart over say wow in about four or five months.
NEUT32|This thing could be near 150 bucks if this trend continues so anyway, that's how I would trade Netflix members get over to the strategy session.
NEUT33|"Lot of stuff to talk about on this break out today."""
