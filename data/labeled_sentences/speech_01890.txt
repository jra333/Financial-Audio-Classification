BEAR0|"""Also a massive run up yesterday Civ is down 8.25% today and an additional 3.53% after hours."
NEUT1|This can largely be attributed to an article published by Wall Street Journal which stated that the deal is in fact not imminent according to people familiar with the matter who these people are exactly what they said is unclear, but this is had an obvious effect on share prices.
BEAR2|The article also seems to make clear attempt to scare investors away from the stock.
NEUT3|This may have validity in some respects.
NEUT4|They show comparison to the.com bubble.
NEUT5|And provide quotes of those who claim that this will end badly.
NEUT6|At some point.
NEUT7|It's true that is likely very few electric vehicle startups will succeed in the long run.
BULL8|However, I also think it is true that Lucid Motors is one of the better contenders, so there is a justified amount of bullishness on the stock.
NEUT9|In my opinion, continued references to Wall Street bets on the market being called a meme market by one investor, although often jokingly.
BEAR10|I do believe that Wall Street bets may sometimes overhype stocks.
NEUT11|But it is also true that read it is almost certainly not claiming to be a hub of financial advice.
NEUT12|With that in mind, this video is also not financial advice.
NEUT13|The sources that I've looked at will be shown in the description for your own interpretations, you can form your own opinion on this.
BULL14|Nevertheless, this is one of the largest Sparks in history, and this had the biggest share price increase before the announcement of the merger.
NEUT15|According to spacinsider.com wealth, rumors have not actually been denied.
NEUT16|Churchill also proposed an earlier deal to DIRECTV.
NEUT17|Which did not end up happening in the end.
BEAR18|This means it's also entirely possible, as many of you are already aware that this deal will not go through, which will almost certainly result in a massive dive in share prices.
NEUT19|So with that in mind, this pack is perhaps quite risky now, particularly at its current price.
BULL20|It has seen massive trading volumes recently relative to before.
BEAR21|An volatility may continue due to the constant use emerging about this stock and lucid Motors, and the speculation of Redditors on Wallstreetbets.
NEUT22|In my opinion, the stock seems increasingly risky, and it's not clear when investors will be given the news of a merger or a denial of the rumor.
NEUT23|Let me know what you guys think about the stock.
NEUT24|Do you believe it's inflated?
NEUT25|Do you think there's a bubble similar to the.com?
NEUT26|Personally, I don't think this bubble, if there is one, is quite to the extent ofthe.com.
NEUT27|Or do you think that the stock has room for our further increase before an announcement?
BULL28|Thanks for watching.
