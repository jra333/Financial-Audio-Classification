NEUT1|This first round matchup pits VM Ware against dry ships.
NEUT2|Well I have to admit a little bit of bias in this particular one as the judge you'd think I'd be sitting high above the battle Royale removed relatively from the arena and I would be impartial, but the truth is I'm not impartial.
NEUT3|VM Ware is one of our selections from Motley Fool Rule Breakers.
BULL4|The service that I managed it The Motley Fool and VM Ware has been a stellar performer.
BULL5|It hasn't been an incredible stock, but it has beaten the stock market by about 35 percentage points.
NEUT6|Since we picked it a few years ago, VM Ware.
NEUT7|Of course the leader in virtualization using software to make hardware and companies more effective.
NEUT8|So it enables companies like ours, The Motley Fool to spend less on hardware and make it count for more.
BULL9|VM Ware has really enabled the cloud computing revolution.
BEAR10|Contrast that with a company that I believe is cynically and poorly managed by the CEO over a dry ships.
NEUT11|It is a shipping company.
BULL12|Shipping does better when the worldwide economy recovers.
BEAR13|I hope the worldwide economy recovers, but dry ships is down from about $120.00 a share a few years ago to $4 a share.
BULL14|Still a billion dollar company, but between these two and between you and me, I'm a little biased here and I'm pretty sure that VM Ware is going to be a good stock for the next five years for our battle Royale I have to pick the best doc over the next 12 months.
NEUT15|You know my choice.
NEUT16|"It's VM Ware."""
