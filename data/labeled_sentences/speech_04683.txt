BEAR0|"""I think the international number was more important anyway and they were off by a little bit."
NEUT1|Not a ton, so I don't think it's doom and gloom by any means.
NEUT2|The reason why international is more important.
NEUT3|My opinion.
NEUT4|That's where the big growth is going to come from.
NEUT5|If the big thesis on Netflix is, it gets a 300,000,000 Subs.
BULL6|Most of that's going to come from international, so if they can get that going faster than they happened, then they'll be in good shape.
NEUT7|What's the explanation?
NEUT8|Max, the company seems to point to its own internal forecasting for the miss on subscriber growth, not a fundamental demand problem.
NEUT9|Do you buy that?
NEUT10|Yeah, and the bigger picture I think I do.
NEUT11|There's always a little bit noise around the quarter most of the time.
NEUT12|The second quarter isn't a real sweet spot for them.
BULL13|It's not the strongest quarter, but it does look like the domestic really kind of spilled.
BULL14|The thing that people who maybe aren't focusing on that we think is a little more positive is that average selling price stayed up, which is part of the reason we got that nice EPS of relatively good total revenue forecast.
NEUT15|Even though we had a kind of big whiff here in terms of the basic subscriber numbers.
BULL16|Obviously the growth is international.
BULL17|There's also a little bit of a chance for greater margin internationally because.
NEUT18|The relative cost of local content can be different, so we don't think anything's changed about the long term prospects of the company, and obviously it wasn't cheap a week ago still isn't cheap now, but it is cheap Earth, and we like the direction.
BEAR19|At the guidance wasn't great going forward.
NEUT20|The comments from Hastings in the letter on competition were very clear.
NEUT21|What do you want to hear from him on the earnings call that could perhaps get people a little bit more relaxed about some of the things I'm going to sort of cut the other way on this.
NEUT22|I actually think that he needs to talk about, you know, the price it needs to go up.
NEUT23|He needs to charge people more for what they are offering because I think longer term, that's where they're going to really hurt if they're going to really pump up the content they need to get more money from the viewers that the actual subscribers is to constantly borrowing from it.
NEUT24|And that's where the real growth is going to come from.
BULL25|They can set the price better going forward, not have to sort of see bigger increases later.
BEAR26|They have spotty track records of raising prices on consumer.
BEAR27|They haven't been great.
NEUT28|I think they do it in these increments that are sort of haphazard.
NEUT29|I think it's it's more regular thing and it starts hard to begin with.
NEUT30|People are less shocked by as we go forward Max.
NEUT31|I want to hear more about this AT&T Time Warner Threat Potential, Fox, Disney, or Fox Comcast threat.
NEUT32|What do you want to hear?
BULL33|Well, I think it's going to be an interesting place.
NEUT34|6 to 12 months from now.
NEUT35|Basically the wisdom for investors in the Netflix story kind of reflects that is.
NEUT36|You want to own the pipelines through which various stuff flows.
NEUT37|You don't want to get into that business already.
NEUT38|Netflix is shaken up by showing that they could drive the good economics on those pipelines if you will, by having the less good economics on the content, pull people in that's already changed.
BULL39|The story, I think it's going to be a good time to be a great content provider.
NEUT40|HBO's been slow to it, but I think they're probably interesting.
NEUT41|The sleeper in the space that no one's talking about, although of course we talked about it when we talk about the fangs is Amazon.
NEUT42|Amazon hasn't turned on The Jets, really.
NEUT43|For Amazon Prime Video, but there are guys are out there buying premium content.
NEUT44|We've had some success in the films, have had some success in award nominations and I think the real story we're telling is the future is probably streaming Amazon's pole position there.
NEUT45|Still the guys to beat, which is why we still like the name, but there's going to be a lot more people chasing an just law of numbers.
NEUT46|Some of them are going to look closer to that second and third position before too terrible law.
