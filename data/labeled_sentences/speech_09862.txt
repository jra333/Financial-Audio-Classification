NEUT0|"""Her friends are not much Alan."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this video.
NEUT2|Friends.
NEUT3|In this video we're going to discuss about the long term chart or the monthly chart of Globalstar ANC and a very positive trend which is emerging in this particular stock.
NEUT4|That's what we're going to discuss in this particular video, so let us first discuss about the two most important level or the support level.
NEUT5|Which we're going to look at, or I would say more than two now.
NEUT6|Here we have you have your first or immediate support at $0.31, point 31.
NEUT7|Then you will look at your next support at .24 and your final support will come at .15 now.
NEUT8|Below 31 I would say one must think whether to carry your positions on the lower side or not because although point 31.24.
BEAR9|And not very distant apart, but breaking down of support level does not indicate a good signal, that's why.
NEUT10|Individual need to understand and take a decision whether he or she want to.
NEUT11|Arrow hold 4.15, which is which will be the biggest support or the stop loss?
NEUT12|Because if the stock falls below .151 must not carry any further positions.
NEUT13|But in between point 31.15.
NEUT14|So you have your choice.
NEUT15|So it's up to you.
NEUT16|Which place do you find convenient?
NEUT17|But because the stock is currently holding about $0.31 and probably the way it is moving, it looks like this will be the final support for the time being.
NEUT18|Or I would say this will be the final low for the time being, so if it is, if it is true, then the levels which we are going to look at are definitely on the up side.
NEUT19|And as I told you, this is for long term, so this is a positional thing.
NEUT20|So do not be in a hurry to take these kind of trends or trades.
NEUT21|So having said that, the target which we are going to see on the upside.
NEUT22|Will start from.
NEUT23|This level.
NEUT24|So this will be our first support target or resistance level.
NEUT25|Let me just show you.
NEUT26|Here we have, so you have your first target or resistance at .75.
NEUT27|Then you have 2.02 and probably you can extend this big target.
NEUT28|Till 4.88.
NEUT29|So this is the big level or these are the big targets for the time being that we're looking in this particular stock, let's see how it will move.
NEUT30|And there is a history that when start doing this particular stock started moving.
BULL31|It will give you a sharp rise in a very short span of time.
NEUT32|So probably this should be the case, but we don't know about that.
NEUT33|That's why we have taken a considerable amount of time.
NEUT34|We will focus on the trend rather than on timing the trend.
NEUT35|So the big levels which we're looking at will be or.
NEUT36|Will extend this price up to 4.8 or $5 on the outside, so this is the end of the video.
NEUT37|If you like this content to say 2000 the comment section and subscribe my channel.
