BULL0|"""Hey everyone, and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about Microvision yes and see this is a very hot stock.
NEUT2|This was a stock that I used to make videos on Liberty when it was like around $2.00 three dollars and it's crazy to see.
NEUT3|For the past few months how crazy you know it's been growing.
BULL4|It's been growing so rapidly, yes, and see that it went up to as high as like $24.00 in $0.18.

BEAR12|So once again the link is down below.
NEUT13|Sign up deposit or $100 down.
NEUT14|Let's talk about Microvision OK, because don't know Microvision was actually doing really good things.
NEUT15|And if you don't know what they do it engages in the development of laser beam scanning technology.
NEUT16|So it has to do everything.
NEUT17|You know, but that and if you guys don't know they were doing really good when it comes to like the pandemic, yes to see last year.
NEUT18|Obviously the market crashed and then you know slowly they were starting to grow up.
NEUT19|They were actually doing a lot of products.
BEAR20|I was covering it here on my channel but from the looks of it the market has been dropping yes and see that it almost dropped to as low as 50% which is absolutely crazy and then slowly recovering going up to $12.38 hasn't seen going up $0.60.
BEAR21|After hours, so by the time you're watching this video it might have gone up, or it might have gone down.
BEAR22|But keep in mind right now the market is dropping OK. Reason why is because of inflation.
BEAR23|Obviously last year we were just printing money and eventually it just came and bit the stock market right in the ****.
NEUT24|So let me know what do you think about Microvision or but I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT25|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys on my next video."""
