NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, just wanted to make a quick video about stocks to buy or to consider."
BEAR1|Facebook has just dropped 20% after hours so this is ridiculous.
BULL2|This is an excellent buy opportunity.
BEAR3|I mean it reached 150 when with the data breach scandal.
BEAR4|With the Cambridge scandal an I personally missed out on it, I thought it was going to go lower than 150 so I put an order a little bit lower than 150.
NEUT5|It didn't reach and then it just went and then just skyrocketed and just went up.
NEUT6|All the way up to.
NEUT7|As you can see here 217.
BEAR8|But today after hours is dropped 20% reaching 172.
NEUT9|So after hours is outside the regular market hours, which is from 9:30 to four.
NEUT10|You can trade after hours, but it's going to be.
BEAR11|It's going to cost you more.
NEUT12|You have to call your broker directly and the fees are way higher.
NEUT13|Not sure if there's a minimum amount you have to buy in order to trade after hours, but it's definitely more expensive to trade after hours regardless.
NEUT14|Hopefully tomorrow when the market opens it is still trading.
BEAR15|At around 170 or even lower.
NEUT16|So definitely a stock to watch.
NEUT17|Now I missed out on it last time at 1:50.
BULL18|Could have made easily 33% in.
NEUT19|Let's see how much time so it's six months, yeah, so not even six months ago, about four months and I went back down.
NEUT20|Hopefully it opens this low tomorrow.
NEUT21|We'll see at 9:30 and if it does, if you're trading long term, even at 170, it's a good price because as you can see it was it was just trading recently at 217 and one year.
NEUT22|Target price is 233.
NEUT23|Anna and of course it's Facebook.
NEUT24|It's not going anywhere if you're more of a short term trade or maybe an you want to really want to get in at the lowest price possible, I'd say maybe wait till 165.
NEUT25|Maybe.
BEAR26|I don't think it's going to go lower than 160.
NEUT27|I mean it's weird though that this happened because with the scandal reached 150 now and look how fast look how fast it went back up after the scandal as if nothing happened, which I called, I called it back then 'cause that always happens.
BEAR28|Socks socks stock price drops.
NEUT29|They find the reason for it.
NEUT30|Goes back up and just find other reasons to justify the movement.
BEAR31|So now Facebook misses revenue expectations, so stock plunges.
BEAR32|I mean, is it really worth 20% decrease decrease because it missed revenue expectation?
BULL33|I mean it's not going to, everyone knows it's going to recover next quarter or even in the following year.
NEUT34|So what's the big deal?
NEUT35|It's not.
BEAR36|It's not worth the plunge of 20%.
NEUT37|So it's really just a buying opportunity.
NEUT38|That's how I see it.
BEAR39|So they had an awful second quarter, so they had an awful second quarter.
NEUT40|And that's why this stock.
NEUT41|Drop so hard after hours, so I'm definitely watching this talk tomorrow.
NEUT42|Thank you.
NEUT43|Should sell your house and buy some Facebook kidding, but try to try to find some liquidity soon and definitely goodbye in my opinion.
NEUT44|I'm definitely intrigued by it.
NEUT45|It ***** that it doesn't pay dividends, but I'm very confident in Facebook.
BEAR46|So let's just hope that tomorrow it opens below 170 an this morning I spoke about Ford which traded at a low of 10.12.
NEUT47|OK, so it's close at 10.52, but.
BULL48|After hours is back for 10.14 an options options went to Dollar twenty any closer to Dollar 50.
NEUT49|So if I had bought some options today at $1.20 and sold at $1.50, would have made 25% in one day.
NEUT50|But I didn't want to take the risk regardless, we'll see tomorrow.
NEUT51|We'll see tomorrow what price it opens at.
NEUT52|I still have my order.
NEUT53|I still have my order at $10.00 an I might have another order on Whirlpool.
NEUT54|I guess I'm going to cancel it and put it on Facebook instead for sure.
BEAR55|Alright, so just want to give you a quick update on which stocks to watch out for us and so just notice that Facebook dropped big time after hours so wanted to give you a heads up.
BULL56|"Thanks for watching."""
