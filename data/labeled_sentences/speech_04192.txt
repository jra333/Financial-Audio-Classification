NEUT1|So I got to see the seriously impressive amount of emails that came in as a response to Monday's episode about financial and investing books.
NEUT2|Apparently you guys are both listeners and readers, so way to not just rely on one of your senses, but Todd and I thought it would be worthwhile to add some of our favourites to the list.
NEUT3|Todd, do you have a favorite investing or financial book?
