NEUT0|"""Guess what, it's that time again?"
NEUT1|Yeah, time for the executive edge.
NEUT2|Welcome back to Squawk Box.
NEUT3|We're watching shares of a firm Holdings.
NEUT4|After yesterday's IPO, the stock initially opened at just under $91.00 a share.
NEUT5|After its IPO priced at $49.00 a share right now, as you can see up another 8% up almost over 105 Andrew, you have some reporting on this other than it's up.
NEUT6|Well, now you know it was interesting 'cause I talked to Max Levchin the night before the IPO and then yesterday spent a lot of time on the phone talking to a lot of people around this offering.
NEUT7|And you look at a stock price and that kind of arise after after an offering you think yourself was a success was a failure.
NEUT8|Did you leave money on the table?
NEUT9|Was this on purpose?
NEUT10|What's the story here?
NEUT11|And fascinating to me and I think this is true of Levchin, and I think it's true of a lot of the CEOs who have left money on the table.
NEUT12|The view inside these companies.
NEUT13|When they are shown the various spreads and what could happen is that they know they actually know that the stock may go up 50%, make up 100%, and a lot of them have been able or been willing to say you know what we're going to leave that on the table, 'cause we want to get a certain type of investor.
NEUT14|In certain institutions who are going to be long term investors in and you know what?
BULL15|If we lose some money along the way on this quick rise, given how hot the market is now, we're willing to accept that will take that.
BULL16|That's OK.
NEUT17|Thought that was such an interesting, and maybe it's just a rationalization, but that's I think a lot about how some of these CEOs who are involved in these IPO's are thinking about it.
NEUT18|And also thinking of themselves that it is a hot market and you know what?
NEUT19|Six months from now?
NEUT20|Nine months from now?
NEUT21|12 months from now it's not clear where these stocks will really trade, so they're actually happier and how many times can we have this this conversation though and not say so?
NEUT22|How much did they sell?
NEUT23|How much does he have left?
NEUT24|So now everything he has left is now priced it at $105.00.
NEUT25|Instead of where it would have been, so it's it's not as much about the initial, but the amount of money that you bring in I I would.
NEUT26|How much does he have?
NEUT27|How much did they sell and how much is still left in the code?
NEUT28|Sure, it's it's.
NEUT29|It's a small part of the company so that not matter with company is valued at at this level, what good is it if you raise a little bit of a pittance at the beginning and the stock doesn't go up in the market cap doesn't double I I don't understand why you would even question whether money was left on the table when the entire company is valued.
NEUT30|At twice as much clearly.
NEUT31|The reason you raise the question is because you say to yourself.
NEUT32|You know, was this thing terribly mispriced, and by default it has to be terribly mispriced.
NEUT33|If it goes up 100% in 24 hours, meaning whatever price you offered, I mean that part unto itself is mind boggling.
NEUT34|The thing that's interesting to me is not actually the idea that the whole company is worth that much more tomorrow, and therefore the 90% that they left on that they still own or hasn't been put into the market has gone up, sure, but the larger point is that what I'm suggesting you is.
NEUT35|That some of these CEOs are saving themselves.
NEUT36|I know this markets hot, it's actually too hot and I want to get a certain type of investor who's going to stick with me for a very long time.
NEUT37|And I don't want them to lose money.
NEUT38|So you know what?
NEUT39|Let's take it at a lower.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
