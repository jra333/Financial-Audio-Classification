BEAR0|"""OK, we're just seconds ago until the start of trading on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, and this is the last day of the second quarter, and you may see some squaring up positions."
NEUT1|And as we can here right now, the opening Bell is going on.
NEUT2|You are watching commodity series by the way, after the rally that we saw in the energy price.
NEUT3|But let me get down to the New York Stock Exchange for immediate few is standing by the very last trading day of the quarter.
BULL4|Anne, what a quarter.
BULL5|It's been the best quarter for the S&P 500 since 1998 were up more than 16%.
BULL6|On the S&P 500 now the SNP is looking to extend those gains today.
BULL7|Assuming that we continue to be in the green throughout the day and we did get some earnings beat.
NEUT8|This beats this morning from Apollo Group, an H&R Block.
BULL9|Also, we got some analysts upgrades of some of the banks like Citigroup and Goldman Sachs.
BULL10|We also got some more positive news on the dividend front coming from General Mills raising their dividend, which of course the major trend has been for people cutting for companies cutting their dividends, not raising them.
NEUT11|Also, Deutsche Bank.
BULL12|Raising their economic growth.
BULL13|Global growth forecast to 2 1/2% for 2010.
NEUT14|So lots of sort of positive bullet points here as this trading day unfolds.
BULL15|We're up about a point and a half on the down.
NEUT16|Dustrial average currently now.
NEUT17|Also interesting to keep an eye on the VIX Volatility index.
BEAR18|We did hit the lowest level there yesterday that we've seen since before the Lehman bankruptcy, so it suggests that there's fear sort of creeping out of the market.
NEUT19|Scott Fullman of WJB Capital, he does derivative strategy there, saying that it shows that investors are becoming complacent with the current investing environment.
NEUT20|He said it also suggested buying options may make more sense than writing them, so perhaps buying protection may be cheap here and also Jeffrey, why so?
BEAR21|I must say technical strategist over Jessica Lamont reminding us we have been pretty much stuck in a trading range here and a volume has been relatively low.
BULL22|But Betty we are up currently six points on the Dow back to you.
BULL23|"OK, Lydia, thanks so much."""
