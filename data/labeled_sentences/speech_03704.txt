BULL0|"""Amazon's up 30% since reporting earnings last quarter and you put a price target on it that's 20% higher than where it is right now."
NEUT1|Why is that necessary?
NEUT2|Well, I think if you made the opposite call at any point on Amazon, you've been wrong, right?
BULL3|And we just continue to see a fundamentally great story and has multiple levers.
NEUT4|The AWS Business and Cloud computing we're all working from home.
NEUT5|The clouds powering the work from home trend, or ordering everything online.
BULL6|The advertising business is flourishing now and we continue to have great checks on the ad side.
NEUT7|So we think that you know the inventories been restocked.
NEUT8|They've gone now just from a sentials to nonessential.
BULL9|And E Commerce as a category continues to fantastic, so we recognized the 60 plus percent run year to date.
NEUT10|We don't want to run investors over a Cliff on this, but again, we continue to look at the sum of the parts.
BULL11|So we take six parts of their business, we apply different multiples to the business and no one thought software would have a 25% multiple increase going into covid, and the EWS business continues to thrive and is generating a higher multiple.
NEUT12|Relative to what?
NEUT13|The rest of the software industry seen, so it's it's multiple factors that play into where we get to our price target.
NEUT14|So Brent, are you doing a similar look at some other stocks that you're taking up price target significantly, either in the E Commerce space specifically or Internet generally?
BULL15|Well, we brought up race circuit up on Microsoft as well and I think that the challenge right now with taxes, taxes had a huge run.
NEUT16|There's been an incredible move and we think the fundamentals are still behind the sector, so each one of these names were looking at differently and in Microsoft again, you know, trades at at, at, at, at, high in terms of the earnings, multiple, But that's the case for us to tag.
NEUT17|Tag continues to work despite these multiples that we've seen, and we think again what's really happening is just the other sectors.
NEUT18|Whether it's energy, banking, other other retailers that are actually physically shutting their storefronts is receiving this new capital and inflow.
BULL19|So this is a portfolio manager, reallocation and we're continuing to see again, fundamental shine intact.
NEUT20|Multiples are there as well, so we're cognizant of that.
NEUT21|And that's definitely a big risk factor.
NEUT22|"Going into this earnings."""
