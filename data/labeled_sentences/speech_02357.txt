NEUT0|"""Age play in this video chart on ticker symbol DISCA, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute."
NEUT1|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|Will another day in the chart continues to hang in there?
NEUT3|The price isn't necessarily making any sort of massive movements, but there is progress that still being made and illustrate this first bit of progress.
BULL4|I am going to make an adjustment to the area.
NEUT5|This area of resistance that red line there and the question just becomes what direction is this adjustment needs to be made and now that we have more data I'm going to just this area of resistance up to that level right there.
NEUT6|At 4560, is that seems to be more so the most accurate area and you go back and you can see, generally speaking, behaved as resistance behaved as resistance, and then once again today behaved as resistance.
NEUT7|And I mean not to insult your intelligence but you solve the direction that I needed to make that adjustment.
NEUT8|That level of resistance need to be adjusted higher, and while that doesn't guarantee anything, my point here is that whenever levels of resistance are adjusted and need to be adjusted upward direction.
BULL9|I mean that's definitely a step in the right direction, so moving forward now key area, resistance stuff is going to be up there at 4560, which again good to see that that.
NEUT10|Level need to be adjusted higher and I'm going to actually throw in one more just in case this thing really starts to come to life again.
NEUT11|So a 4560 can be broken.
NEUT12|The next key area after that would then be up there right around the 4750 mark.
NEUT13|So keep an eye on those couple areas of resistance moving forward as far as supports are concerned.
NEUT14|Nothing new here to report.
BULL15|Still have that light level right there at the $42 mark which was tested this morning.
BULL16|So great to see that we got more confirmation.
BEAR17|You can see on that drop price.
BULL18|Got right around that area and it held strong.
BULL19|So good to see that there are still buyers down around that area.
NEUT20|And then if the $42 mark can't quite hold up next level of support would be down there around that $39.00 mark.
NEUT21|But All in all, like I said, surely slowly.
NEUT22|But surely the price continues to make progress forward, so it'll be interesting to see how this plays out on Thursday.
NEUT23|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT24|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT25|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL26|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT28|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR29|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT30|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT31|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT32|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT33|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
