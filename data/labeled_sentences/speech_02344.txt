NEUT1|Here traders helping traders helping you grow your portfolio one trade at a time.
NEUT2|Right now we're going to talk about Disney so I had a lot of people asking me about Disney asking me to do a video on this.
NEUT3|And ironically, on top of that we got a big potential situation happening here on Disney with this massive bull flag happening here.
NEUT4|So it's like everything kind of lined up perfectly at a couple people asked me to make a video on Disney.
NEUT5|I saw a ton of calls happening on Disney, a really good both like happening on Disney.
NEUT6|And I took a position on Disney, so we get to kill a couple birds with one stone in this video before we get into this breakdown, guys hit the like button.

NEUT8|It's the easiest way for you to support small Youtubers like myself, so it's getting into it.
BULL9|So looking at Disney, first of all you can see in the past year the stock has done nothing but go up, so number one we have the trend in our direction.
NEUT10|Remember the trend is your friend is a lot easier to play continuation patterns than it is to attempt to play a reversal or find the bottom or time the top.
NEUT11|Trust me, I've done this for seven years full time and I will tell you it is a lot easier to do that now.
NEUT12|Looking at Disney here, then you see, we have a really good bull flag that's forming.
BULL13|Essentially is when we get a consistent push up.
NEUT14|This acts as our flagpole and then it consolidation period.
NEUT15|Usually halfway down that initial push considered to be our flag.
NEUT16|You can also see here on our TTM squeeze indicator that we have a ton of black and red dots.
BEAR17|Black is showing that the stock is squeezing.
NEUT18|Red is showing that the stock is really really squeezing and want to stock is squeezing.
NEUT19|Usually has to be released an in this case when we have a bull flag where the squeeze, it is usually a release to the top.
NEUT20|Something else you can kind of see here is that the Mac D cross.
BULL21|Now normally people have Mac, these that are sitting above kind of like separated but I just put mine right in the background because I don't really use my Mac D that much but we did get a good cross on the Mac D here so overall with a nice cross Mac D3 days of consolidation above our major resistance here on this daily chart.
BULL22|This is a huge confirmation for me that I believe there's a high probability that Disney is going to break out.
NEUT23|Now.
BEAR24|Of course it can fall back down to supports at 177, but I feel about 8085% chance then in the next couple of weeks.
BULL25|Disney is going to push up about 10% up to $200 now.
NEUT26|We take a look at our flow here on Black Box.
NEUT27|You will see that in the past two days nothing but calls on Disney.
NEUT28|Tons of 2C or four, sixteen $200 calls all across the board.
NEUT29|About $1,000,000 in the past couple of days alone flowing into this all the same strike all the same date.
NEUT30|Most of them above the ask or at the ask.
NEUT31|Overall this exact type of flow that I want to see in about $65 million with the dark pools hit today coming into after hours.
BULL32|Overall guys I really really like this position.
NEUT33|You know for me I have shares.
NEUT34|See how many.
NEUT35|I don't have alot 30 shares so it's not a big position for me but still if you're looking to trade this I would say shares or.
NEUT36|Personally, maybe grab some calls that go out till June.
NEUT37|I want to give myself some time so I would say get some calls.
NEUT38|Personally member I'm not a financial advisor, but personally I'd be looking at some calls for June about $190.00 strike right at the money.
