BULL0|"""Hello YouTube, welcome back into the channel today and today I'm gonna be talking bout AMC Entertainment stock AMC stock has recently seen a big movement coming from around the $11.00 all the way up to $14.00."
BULL1|So we've had a big jump as of today.
BEAR2|We are pretty much broke even ever since we opened up with market today so that is something that we have to take a look at and only around 5% of you guys are actually subscribed so make sure you do leave me a lot, Subscribe down below if you like this type of content.
NEUT3|So now it's kind of go over a little bit about the process, action some news and updates on AMC stock.
BULL4|Therefore as of today we have seen red volume of 54 million so far with an average 10 day volume on a.
NEUT5|The stock at around 152,000,000 in a 10 day.
NEUT6|6.298 billion market cap.
NEUT7|That is something that we do need to expect and take a look at with AMC Entertainment as they're going to be opening up a lot of different movie theaters here soon.
NEUT8|As previously mentioned, I do kind of want over the movie theater operator said that most of its cinemas will be reopened by March 26.
NEUT9|The announcement comes right after hours.
BEAR10|The Walt Disney Company said it plans to open his California theme parks to eliminate capacity on April 30th through the pandemic.
NEUT11|The movie theater chains have not.
BULL12|Able to contend with shutting cinemas but also filmmaker movie releases.
NEUT13|2 videos on demand or streaming services during the fourth quarter, Disney decided to move its highly anticipated film so produced through its Pixar animation studio to a streaming service Disney Plus, as long as the cinemas do real open back up, AMC theatres could get you know back to full capacity that's going to be something that AMC is going to need for the revenue long term.
NEUT14|And I can't talk about the shorts available is going to be around 650,000 at this time, but the short volume is 17.3.
NEUT15|Million with the Market Volume of around 122,000,000.
NEUT16|So let's have a short volume ratio of around 14% and we recently had saying we see that kind of have that big run up here as you guys can see.
NEUT17|And now we're sitting right around the same area that we could not resist from right here around the 1408 Mark.
NEUT18|So something we do have to take a look at as well.
NEUT19|The last time we seen this type of consolidation period was around right here, and that was right before the run up.
NEUT20|Going into around the 13 breaking resistance.
BULL21|But I do expect that we're going to break the resistance of 1454.
NEUT22|And we go back up to around the 15th of the $16.00 mark.
BULL23|I do think AMC Entertainment does see some movement.
BULL24|Just recently we had actually bounced off of the resistance I mentioned earlier, and now we're starting to see the downtrend going to around back to 1393.
NEUT25|Now, do we need to go past the 1384 mark to see if we're going to actually go further down?
NEUT26|That is a number that we did.
NEUT27|Take a look at as well because we're so close in with consolidation period, we need to see what is going to happen next.
NEUT28|AMC Entertainment recently has took a downfall around $0.07.
BEAR29|It looks like it is going to go back up as I do think AMC Entertainment is going to be a good hold, but we could potentially see something like we did here earlier and that could be just something that is going to happen and we could see it drop back down to around a $13.00 mark.
BEAR30|But if we do not break the resistance of the 1408 into 1454 we could easily go back down to the 12 to $13.00 mark.
NEUT31|I do think the AMC Entertainment is going to be when you want to hold long term because this is going to be a stock that will see a lot of movement.
NEUT32|Definitely is going to be a lot like GameStop.
BULL33|Do I think AMC Entertainment is going back up to around the $20 mark of the all time?
NEUT34|Ha, I don't think AMC could potentially go to the all time.
NEUT35|How the 52 week range of 2036 anytime soon.
BULL36|But I do think that it could potentially see that again long term, once the cinemas to open their revenue starts building back up as they are completely out of debt.
BULL37|At this moment I could see IMC going back up to around the 15 to the $17.00 mark, but I think it will kind of have a good steady there but we can see go potentially further if it does get shorted.
