NEUT0|"""Watching Home Value Store in the last 12 months is just not like I kept watching our house."
NEUT1|On Zillow.
BULL2|You know those estimates have going up and up and up.
NEUT3|That's why Matt Clancy and his wife decided they were going to sell their Burlington home in January.
NEUT4|It's really totally motivated by just trying to capture the equity and make a little bit of a bump up.
NEUT5|They only just closed on a different house this month.
NEUT6|There just wasn't a lot available and the House is up for sale that they did like.
NEUT7|We can before there's another house that we act like and we had probably.
BULL8|A handful of other offers come in way above asking where we just.
BEAR9|We had no ability to compete for getting 60 to 80 showings in the first two or three days on the market, and they're going to be competing against 20 to 30 offers.
NEUT10|It's something Amber Harvelle's has not seen in her ten years as a real estate agent.
NEUT11|We literally just go knock on their door and say, hey, we have a buyer that would love to buy your home.
BEAR12|Are you interested in selling about 1 1/2 to two homes are selling for every home listed, which is what's driving inventory to be extremely low right now.
NEUT13|They have about half the inventory they had this time.
BULL14|Last year she thought the COVID-19 pandemic would have put a damper on things, but if anything it's prompting people to make some changes, no matter the cost.
NEUT15|Most of our homes are selling for about four to 5% over sales price when they're working from home, they need a place that they can come in and close the door, be removed from the rest of the house.
NEUT16|Probably as people want to at home amenities now more than ever.
NEUT17|She's also seen people moved to the area from out of town, not just because of the lower cost of living you can buy probably 1 1/2 times the house versus those other areas, so a $200,000 house here is probably 3 to $400,000 house in.
NEUT18|This place is but the extreme growth in development.
BULL19|The Burlington area is seeing we have an Amazon distribution center coming.
NEUT20|"The Chick-fil-A distribution centers coming and its proximity to other cities where families like Clancy's can get to work easily muted out Raleigh prior to the pandemic is halfway between Greensboro and we're only prime area."""
