NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another episode of Bubble Trading."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|I'm going to be doing some technical analysis for the ticker at WS GF which is World Series of golf.
NEUT3|You know, at some point they're supposed to have their name changed to vacate Shella.
NEUT4|This is an OTC stock and it's one that we've actually made a couple of due diligence videos on, so go through our due diligence playlist and you can find a couple of videos on this one if you want.
NEUT5|As a disclaimer, I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT6|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT7|If you're going to do any investing and go ahead and speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT8|Full disclosure, I do have a super tiny position on this one.
NEUT9|Nothing, nothing crazy, but just to be fully transparent.
NEUT10|So me and Nick were kind of talking about this one an RDD videos around the three cent mark.
NEUT11|And if you look back we had drawn this.
NEUT12|You know, after this big run up I was drawing out this trend line of this super long consolidation and I was kind of saying, you know that if they can't hold this $3 range it might be bouncing around in this channel.
NEUT13|So it kind of went pretty close to the bottom of this trend line.
NEUT14|So you could have arguably even drawn it a little bit higher, just the bottom of you know where all these candles are closing so it got right around the bottom of this trendline.
BEAR15|Started to bounce off today.
NEUT16|A lot of volume.
NEUT17|You know this price.
BULL18|The stock price went all the way up to about four.
NEUT19|Just under four and a half cents.
BULL20|So a lot of volume today it broke out again above this three cent level.
BULL21|Tried to retest and close above that that four cent range, but couldn't quite do it today.
BULL22|So at this point moving forward, I want to see now this three cent level hold us support.
NEUT23|I'd say probably the first support level to watch for it.
NEUT24|Be like the.
NEUT25|And I'll pull it up on the four hour time frame so you can see a little bit better.
NEUT26|And again, this is just a technical standpoint, right?
NEUT27|Like I'm not talking about any of the news that they've dropped or anything like that.
NEUT28|This is just from a charting standpoint.
NEUT29|What I would be looking for.
NEUT30|So a couple of spots I'd want to see hold right now would obviously you know the first one be.
NEUT31|Pretty much where this candle was right here about that three.
NEUT32|Three and a half cent mark below that, you know I'd want to see like the three point 33.4 range hold, but ultimately the biggest level to hold for me at this point would be that three cent range lose that, and we're back in this channel, so.
NEUT33|You know, ultimately, I think I think one of the bigger spots I'd really want to see hold to not give back too much of my gains would be about that 033 so 3.3 cent mark.
NEUT34|But you could also, if you really want to keep a tight stop on this one, would be about that 3.6 cent mark.
BULL35|Ultimately, I think a break and hold above $0.04 on either the four hour or daily candle could send this one up easily to five plus cents, especially if they continue to drop more news.
NEUT36|So that's kind of what I'd be looking for in the short term.
BEAR37|Obviously a break and close above is 5 and a half cent range could send this much, much higher, potentially even to $0.10, but again, you know that's looking pretty far out and you know, with a pretty bullish eye.
NEUT38|So obviously there are so bearish scenarios for this one, just considering that they you know they do have some delusion going on.
BEAR39|This one's been pretty weak for the last couple of weeks, so I think there are still some some bearish scenarios to lookout for.
NEUT40|So if you are trading this one, just have your own trading plan and kind of know what levels you might want to use as your risk.
NEUT41|But again, this isn't advice, so speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT42|If you're going to invest.
NEUT43|But yeah, those so those are just some of the bullish and bearish scenarios I'd be looking at for this stock.
NEUT44|So if you're trading this one, or you know this video, provide any value to you, go ahead and like, comment, subscribe and share.
NEUT45|Let me know if you want to see me talk about anything else, or if you agree with anything I said.
NEUT46|Interest always interested to hear.
BULL47|"And with that being said, you know, thank you for watching everyone."""
