NEUT4|With the market maintaining the lower lows and lower highs pattern started from one point 4375.
BULL5|Pika reached in April in the short term, we expect some consolidation.
NEUT6|As long as both there at 10 constant line and the blue congestion line hold steady.
BULL7|While if you look at various side down here, this has been moving around its neutral threshold of 50.
BEAR8|The past couple of days supporting that the pair could lack momentum in the short term as well.
BULL9|And now bout resistance levels.
BULL10|Move to the upside and above 1.29 could meet the area between between the blue changes in line currently at one point 2936 and julies low one point 2956.

NEUT17|How we could look for support at one point had 26 where any significant step lower and.
BEAR18|Any significant blower could worsen markets bearish outlook opening the way towards 126 and one point 2560.
NEUT19|Finally turning to the medium term picture.
BULL20|The bear sentiment here has strengthened after this downfall towards one point 2660 and now only move above 1.32. Who could help the could help the market to return to neutrality while a break above one point 3471 could bring the bullish picture back into play.
