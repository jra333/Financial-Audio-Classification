NEUT0|"""I mean, you know when I look at what's going on in in the market again, I come back to."
NEUT1|There are stocks that are just unbelievably good and they tend to be stocks that react well when interest rates are going up.
BEAR2|And then there's these stocks that are just so bad and the younger people tend to be in the stocks that are so bad I continue to see that when you look at what's what's going higher, you've got a lot of the entertainment stocks up because I think that's just the fallout that maybe we're behind.
NEUT3|We're done with the with the archigos failure.
NEUT4|Black shouldn't say failure because they're still around and some people want to give them money, but the one that I'm most fascinated by, Carl, is GameStop.

NEUT6|Elliott Wilkie don't know the person, Chief growth Officer, but the people they are adding if they're going to.

NEUT18|No wing, obviously, Ryan Cohen has a story he's telling where he is getting some of the greatest people, and they're not deterred.
NEUT19|They're not thinking.
NEUT20|Obviously these are people are not saying it's a short squeeze.
NEUT21|These are people were saying, we know that this $14 billion market cap company is something that we it is a maybe it's clay and it's going to be turned into a sculpture, but I am.
NEUT22|I am blown away by who they're getting an it's most of the companies in the mall would not get these kind of people.
