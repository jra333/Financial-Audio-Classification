BEAR0|"""Yes Sir, you already know this would be a very bad with another."
NEUT1|That's going to get right into it.
NEUT2|You know, we're not waste nobody time before we do that.
NEUT3|Let's get this video.
NEUT4|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they will be touching bases on theory that's ticker symbol TRYIB input you alone to rate every time I said to Ray always let you know I was bullish, bullish on it I'll let you know that it was one of my main ones that on going **** ** an also weed is going to be a very very big thing.
NEUT5|You feel like we don't want to be just as big as.
NEUT6|EVV legalize all over is going to be just as big as easy, so let's go ahead and get right into it.
BULL7|Yeah, I hope you all got in on this.
NEUT8|I've been telling you how to get this since 22 dollars $2223.00 range.
NEUT9|Let's check out my position.
NEUT10|I got a total cost of 4100 we up about 1400 right now.
NEUT11|When you got the average price of $22.57 the last price was 33rd $30.42.
BULL12|We up about $8.00 a share.
NEUT13|So the market value now is 5600 for this position.
NEUT14|Anteriore, let's check it out to Ray.
NEUT15|Right now.
BULL16|We trade in about $30.68 we up 11.2% today.
NEUT17|The open was 2722, the high was 3134, the low was 2693.
BULL18|The 52 week high was $67.
BEAR19|A 52 week lows, 243 OK.
NEUT20|If we look on the chart.
NEUT21|Yeah, let's go ahead and check it out.
NEUT22|So the day if anybody later apartment like Dang I missed, you really want to get in on.
NEUT23|I'm going to look at and see what my support on the chart is for today far as if you pull back.
NEUT24|If it pulled back in, which I know it, will it always do, and then it's gonna pull back right before right before power hour, right before 3 right before the closing, and then after that close it's going to Spike right back up so at 31 and possibly going to see where it's going?
BULL25|But anyways, we gotta support right here at $28.25.
NEUT26|So like we formed a support right here at the low 28th.
BEAR27|And if we break that 28, we could possibly pull back down to the $2627.00 range, which but I think we got a strong support at $28.00.
BULL28|And we broke through resistance.
BEAR29|We had resistance at $29.15.
NEUT30|We broke straight through that and we had to have like 30 or $31 and $31.34.
NEUT31|So right here on the chart.
NEUT32|Write down the chart with for 3139 dash, great from.
NEUT33|Once we broke that 29 resistance we could flash crater or $34 notes nonstop.
NEUT34|We could've went straight over $34 and that's what we want.
NEUT35|We headed to Nicks.
NEUT36|Is that $34.63?
NEUT37|Soon as we break through thirty 463 this thing could be on his way to revisit the highs of 6391 to hide that we hit on favorite 10 when to hit his peak.
NEUT38|The issue we could revisit that level soon.
BULL39|Sustain breakthrough $34.63.
NEUT40|We can most definitely probably see that in push higher from here so you already know that.
NEUT41|Don't mean go and put all your money until ready because we're bullish on like that or your rent money.
NEUT42|You know you always wanna wait for pullbacks.
NEUT43|You wanna be smart, meticulous and never go all in 'cause anything happen in the market.
NEUT44|You feed me anything so I always be smart.
NEUT45|Meticulous with your investment decisions.
NEUT46|This is not financial advice.
NEUT47|I'm just here to show you how it behaves doing.
NEUT48|And help you out.
