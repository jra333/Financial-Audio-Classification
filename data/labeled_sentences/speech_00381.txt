BEAR0|"""Look what happened in the markets in the last few days is really messed up."
NEUT1|We have many so many questions that must be answered and must be answered immediately.
NEUT2|The SEC has said they will investigate and am I am urging the relevant Senate committees to investigate and do it quickly to get answers to the many questions that loom out there and we need all the platforms to cooperate.
NEUT3|Consumers and so many others.
NEUT4|Retail investors deserve answers and we want to get those answers quickly.
NEUT5|Be 'cause we cannot have a stock market where the players are also the refs.
NEUT6|That's the fundamental problem here.
NEUT7|We need equity for all participants.
NEUT8|The markets only work when there seemed to be on the up and up in.
NEUT9|The average investor has a fair chance and and actions in recent days.
NEUT10|Call that into question.
NEUT11|That's why we need investigation.
NEUT12|Restricting sales without warnings or even alerting consumers beyond real time just screams.
NEUT13|Of inequity in this space when you sign up for a trade.
NEUT14|Whether you're a big firm or a single person.
NEUT15|You have rights.
NEUT16|We have to make sure those rights are preserved and not unequal.
BEAR17|An effort to manipulate or restrict access to the markets to seemingly give an advantage to wealthiest investors would be reprehensible.
NEUT18|"The playing field we need the playing field not to be tilted against average folks, we must ensure their interests are much better protected as we move forward, and that's why we need a thorough investigation."""
