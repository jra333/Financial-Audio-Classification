BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
NEUT2|Hope you guys are having a fantastic day and before I get started this one quickly mention once again they have the link to my discord in the scription we have over 1800 members.
NEUT3|We have a great community in there so feel free to join and check that out if you haven't already.
NEUT4|Both amounts get right to this video and stay there.
NEUT5|Gonna be going over a company known as Morphic Holdings.
NEUT6|They are biopharmaceutical company as you guys can see.
BULL7|Huge breakout day today up $46.64 or about 130.92% up to a total now of $83.19.
BULL8|We take our symbol is just MRF and as you can see here on the weekly chart now they are going to be up about 146% and then on the year now up 434.9%.
NEUT9|Ever since the lows back here in early 2020 can see the reason behind this huge movement today isn't because of their earnings report and they actually did release earnings yesterday.
BEAR10|Came out with a quarterly loss or EPS loss of about $0.57 per share or Stephanie loss of $0.37.
NEUT11|So that is a pretty big miss there.
BEAR12|And they also did miss on revenue as well.
NEUT13|So you may be asking yourself what's the reason why?
BULL14|Over 130%, Despite that Big Miss, you can see they did announce a positive news about their interim data for a Phase one clinical trial drug to treat inflammatory bowel disease.
NEUT15|You can see this was just a test.
BULL16|The safety and things like that and as a result of the study drug was generally well tolerated with no serious side effects at all.
BULL17|So obviously that's great news.
NEUT18|You can also see SD by down here and they also still do have this license agreement in place with Abby, which is a farmer giant.
NEUT19|You can also see if I Scroll down a little bit further yesterday they came out and said that Abby paid them additional $20 million.
NEUT20|Are to assume responsibility to develop and commercialize a couple of their pipeline candidates.
NEUT21|So obviously this truck would fall in that category.
BULL22|So overall, guys, I do think this is good news for them.
BEAR23|I think the earnings report is a little bit iffy and that this is kind of an overreaction up 130% or $46 and expecting to fall back down in the next few days, but as of now they do have the momentum going to break them down here on thinkorswim you can see huge amounts of volume throughout the entire day.
BULL24|Today it did Spike upwards at the early morning hours all way up to $68 before pulling back to this view up.
NEUT25|Bouncing off of it again, kind of, slowly consolidating throughout the middle of the day, only to about 12:37 PM.
BEAR26|They just shut up once again on huge amounts of volume all way up to this upper view up at $86.77 and they reached a high shortly after of $90.10 and you can see at the moment they are still kind of consolidating in this range.
BEAR27|Lower volume right here at $83.44.
BEAR28|If you go ahead and look at the bigger picture here in 180 day time frame you can see they do look pretty overextended.
NEUT29|The RSI is going to be extremely high at nearly 9090.
NEUT30|Hi, if I go ahead and zoom in on this section you can see they're going to disconnect it from all these emails as well, and that's kind of as expected, particularly early timeframe.
BEAR31|Going to see pretty much the same thing RSI on this time frame looks to be about 8889 ninety, so like I said, I would advise against buying, especially after the earnings miss and you expect them to pull back down the next few days the next few weeks, probably at least down to about 50 to $60.00.
NEUT32|If you do want to get in there, and that's a much better entry in my opinion, but in that case that is about it for this video.
