NEUT0|"""How everyone let's take out the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see this is the weekly chart for Apple and what I need to mention is that here is very likely to form a Cup and handle pattern.
NEUT2|So the Cup body is here so the beginning is this red candle and then this is the body of the Cup.
NEUT3|And now if we draw a line.
NEUT4|Here.
NEUT5|With this light that they can see at this.
NEUT6|Huge green candle breakout.
NEUT7|We have formed the handle part of the pattern, so it's very likely for Apple to form a Cup and handle pattern.
BULL8|So when we begin at the handle pattern will go up further for a very stunning extent.
NEUT9|So in my opinion, here should be a very good .2 idea.
NEUT10|"Stock, thank you."""
