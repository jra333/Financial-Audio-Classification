NEUT0|"""We just in one fell swoop, basically seeing the reimagining of this company at least from an investor standpoint."
BULL1|At first thanks, thanks for having me today and I think I think that's exactly right.
BEAR2|What you're seeing is James made a number of strategic investments in bets along the way for a number of years, and I think the value of these investments has really been trapped.
NEUT3|We've seen come to market is enlightenment.
NEUT4|Some of these auto tech ventures from new companies and some other established companies.
NEUT5|Can to bring to Gemma, Jim has a lot of these state assets so you think about they own about 70% of cruise, which is which is what stuck on the investment with Microsoft today.
NEUT6|That's really like a robotaxi type outfit.
NEUT7|They have their Altium battery joint venture which is with LG which is building batteries for electric vehicles and electric vehicles themselves.
NEUT8|30 new vehicles by the Middle Directory.
NEUT9|I see yes the other week they announced the right track for last mile delivery.
BULL10|So a number of these technologies, a collection of them really, and I think these announcements like today helped investors realize that GM can really be a meaningful player in where transportation is headed.
NEUT11|Hey Joe, I'm long the stock had a lot of the same ideas that you did.
BEAR12|I'm a little bit frustrated though because I feel like GM should be higher and to some extent it's still being tide to a lot of these terrestrial valuation metrics by the analyst community.
NEUT13|Whereas you know, it seems like it's got one hand tied behind its back, whereas Tesla really isn't constrained by anything.
NEUT14|Logic physics throw it all in the garbage.
NEUT15|Why isn't GM getting more of a benefit given how advanced they are?
NEUT16|Why can't we untether this thing from the way that you would traditionally value an automaker they have 70% of cruise Now, which is being valued at what do we think?
NEUT17|30 billion?
NEUT18|Why not 50?
NEUT19|What if it were a standalone public company?
NEUT20|Yeah, I mean the the mark today was 4:30 billion.
NEUT21|Again, new and beyond 7% and I think there's a there's some validity to what you're saying, because if you if you back out the valuation of cruise, you know the entire T or the remainder of GM is probably training for something like three times you get done.
NEUT22|So I think there is a potential GM definitely has a transition that they need to make from the business model today to the business model of the future.
NEUT23|And I think announcements like today announcements I can come over the.
BULL24|Course of the year can get investors to continue to recognize that GM can continue to make this transition and unlock further shareholder value.
NEUT25|The other thing is, like you know, oftentimes you know you need.
NEUT26|You need a.
NEUT27|You need a catalyst, right?
NEUT28|Or or some unlocking events to realize that value is clearly today taking on money.
NEUT29|Bring on Microsoft, which you know we didn't spend a lot of time on it, but it is a clear important technology partner, right?
BULL30|It provides them with that cloud and computing platform that they could compete because.
NEUT31|You know this is a big opportunity, autonomous vehicles, but they're not the only ones going after, right?
NEUT32|You have Amazon, you've got others and and and I think bringing on the technology part is important.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
