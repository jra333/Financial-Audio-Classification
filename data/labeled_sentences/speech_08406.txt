NEUT0|"""The joke about economists is that summer find it hard to forecast past events."
NEUT1|Well, W stay did some digging and found out that not all are created equal.
NEUT2|In fact, women are better at forecasting the economy than men.
BULL3|Today, we're joined by the best economic forecaster, Beth Ann Bovino.
NEUT4|She is US Chief economist at S&P Rating Services, and there she is.
BULL5|Happy Valentine's Day Bethan, thank you.
NEUT6|Great to be here so we have a a list of your forecast that suddenly the big ones.
BULL7|And we're going to put that up and it's amazing.
BEAR8|The actual number is 7% jobless.
BULL9|Rate is what it was for Q4 and you predicted 6.9% the GDP 2.9 versus 2.7 all very very close.
NEUT10|What is your secret source an can I have some?
NEUT11|Well, I can't.
NEUT12|I would love to say that it was female intuition, but it wasn't.
NEUT13|You just looked at.
NEUT14|I was looking at 2012.
NEUT15|What we went through and what we saw was people.
NEUT16|It was after four years that basically cleaning up their balance sheets.
NEUT17|We saw people.
BULL18|Households and businesses ready to spend household household household networth hit a record high or started to reach that record high of 2007.
BULL19|We saw and that meant that stock prices were higher in home prices started to climb higher, making people who are holding their home feel a little bit richer.
BULL20|We saw jobs coming around.
BULL21|We saw jobs coming around, maybe not as much as we wanted, but businesses were also holding onto their onto their workers, suggesting that people have money to spend a couple other things that we were looking at looked fairly positive.
NEUT22|the Fed look like they weren't going to.
NEUT23|Move away from really giving that.
NEUT24|Giving the economy what it needed to grow.
BULL25|And that was another positive.
NEUT26|So your your latest paper.
NEUT27|I think it's the latest one February the 10th.
NEUT28|It says recovery postponed and not cancelled and you know you must be right 'cause you are our best forecaster in the Wall Street Journal survey.
NEUT29|But some of the data I've seen looks forward to not good stuff so knew or the new order segment of the ASM manufacturing survey.
BEAR30|That was the biggest drop since 1980.
NEUT31|We saw in that component and that represents future economic activity.
NEUT32|We saw a new home sales and housing starts both, which represent future economic activity.
BULL33|Not doing that great either and I'm looking forward at those things.
NEUT34|And I'm saying that doesn't augur good things.
NEUT35|How do you square that with its postponed not canceled?
NEUT36|Well, I just looked out the window.
NEUT37|I see all the snow that's it's hard to make people go to get together.
BEAR38|It's hard, it's a hard commute for people to get to work.
BEAR39|It's hard to go to school.
BEAR40|It's hard to go to the mall so you're going to see things slowing down in New York City, we've been pretty much wiped out by snow, and it's not just in New York.
NEUT41|It's in many, many parts of the United States.
BEAR42|We have seen in for December and January combined it's the coldest.
BEAR43|It's the coldest weather in the third, coldest weather in 30 years.
NEUT44|January is no is no difference, but what's surprising and why?
NEUT45|I'm still optimistic about what to expect for the year is that when we look at the jobs numbers?
BEAR46|Certainly disappointing on the headline.
BEAR47|But if you go further in households, people who were asked why they if they couldn't get to work and why we found that in December and January, about close to 550,000 people said they couldn't get to work because of weather.
BEAR48|And this of course means that, well, they couldn't make those orders, and they couldn't certainly get those those shipments out.
BEAR49|It slows down the economy, but I expect once winter passes we expect to see some uptrend.
BULL50|Well, we all hope you're right.
BULL51|'cause we'd love to see the economy warming up a bit more than it is.
BULL52|Thank you very much, Beth and Bovino.
BULL53|"We appreciate your time."""
