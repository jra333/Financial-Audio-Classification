NEUT0|"""Let's turn our attention to what's been happening in the tech space and specifically with IPOs and with deals."
NEUT1|So let's begin with a deal that it has been widely reported will be announced later today, and that is Salesforce acquiring Slack.
NEUT2|Salesforce is set to come out with its latest quarterly report after the closing Bell today, CNBC's David Faber, reporting yesterday that the deal would be quote at a premium to slacks valuation, which right now is $24 billion.
NEUT3|Brian Sozzi would be half in cash, half in stock.
NEUT4|And it's an interesting deal on a number of levels.
NEUT5|Sales force trying to compete with Microsoft once again, but also speaks to what we've heard from some of our guests on this program.
NEUT6|Animal spirits coming back into the market.
NEUT7|Well, miles, I think you know.
NEUT8|By most indications, this deal might get done around $25 billion in slacks market.
NEUT9|Cap now is about $25 million, so I wouldn't be surprised to hear that number across the wires.
NEUT10|But for Salesforce I think their recent acquisitions.
NEUT11|You look at Tableau.
BULL12|They have been emboldened by their integrations, which for the most part have been successful.
BULL13|Successful to try to pull off what could be the largest acquisition in the company's history and then with Salesforce really looked.
NEUT14|And the dominance of email, you know, I've talked to Slacks, Co-founder Stewart Butterfield many, many times.
NEUT15|He is really obsessed with sending email but I think at this point he realizes it's probably a better idea to join forces with the Salesforce.
BULL16|Get their scale, get more into enterprise and reach more enterprise customers to get to that mission of eventually ending email.
NEUT17|I don't know if it'll happen, but they might get a little closer to it.
NEUT18|It's so interesting to me the valuation at which this something like this could happen, right?
NEUT19|Given what the stock has done this year, the idea that the sales force would come in at these levels and make a purchase?
NEUT20|I mean you look at those sorts so called work from home landscape, right?
NEUT21|You look at a zoom.
NEUT22|You look at some of the other companies that have really benefited appellate on.
NEUT23|For example, we haven't seen any deals really.
NEUT24|This would be the first of those.
NEUT25|The first big one of these work from home companies.
BEAR26|And they're having to pay up for it because of what we have seen this year.
NEUT27|You know, it's interesting though, if you look at this, it was you look at sales forces strategy though.
NEUT28|For the last decade plus right?
NEUT29|Marc Benioff loves to use his stock as currency and that their stock is says almost doubled so far this year.
BULL30|In fact, to its high.
NEUT31|Is it more than doubled?
NEUT32|That hasn't been out of Tysons mid August, but there's certainly I guess Julie.
NEUT33|Even if they're paying that premium for Slack, it's certainly to.
NEUT34|Salesforce still seems like something of a discount, at least considering what their in-house currency.
NEUT35|If you want to think about it that way, has done in the last few months, yes.
NEUT36|No, I was just going out.
NEUT37|What you're seeing is 1 Salesforce pay up to potentially try to end email but also to Slack has had a promising service called Slack Slack.
NEUT38|Connect our Slack direct and really what they've tried to do is connect one Corporation to another and that is not necessarily worked out too great just yet.
NEUT39|It's been a hard sell, but it could become a much easier sell just given once you're under that Salesforce umbrella and you have a lot of the connections in the enterprise space.
BULL40|Yeah, I think perhaps in the media space, because Slack has had such a big uptake.
NEUT41|"Here we get lost, and how popular really is kind of across the enterprise stack where where Salesforce is working a bit more closely."""
