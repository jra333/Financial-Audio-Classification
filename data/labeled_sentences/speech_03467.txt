NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, Steve Aquino at base camp trading."
NEUT1|I'm watching Apple today here on Tuesday, April 6.
BULL2|You can see the market action and Apple has been pretty good today.
BULL3|High is 127.13 almost matching the high.
NEUT4|Here from the 16th of March 127.22, so we're really close to breaking out.
NEUT5|You see almost a triple bottom pattern, especially from the low on the 8th to the low here on roughly the 30th.
BULL6|We've got some increasing momentum in the past four days with this bullish move.
NEUT7|I think if we can break above 127 and a quarter or the next stop is roughly 128.81 and then if we continue to hire.
NEUT8|These include trend dots at 133 1/2 really good target for Apple.
BULL9|News about the upcoming iPhone has been pretty popular.
NEUT10|I know that Apple could actually be releasing some products here very soon.
BULL11|"I think that there will be some bullish sentiment there and I would definitely look for the breakout above 127 and a quarter, thanks."""
