NEUT0|"""Yo when crease, what's going on?"
NEUT1|It is December 26, 2020 and we're going to get into the market recap.
BULL2|Hope everybody had a Merry Christmas market.
NEUT3|Will reopen on Monday on the market.
NEUT4|Closed this week on Wednesday.
NEUT5|I'm sorry Thursday around 2:00 o'clock, and that's eastern so.
BULL6|Market closed and we are approaching new highs and that's what we discussed last week.
NEUT7|So let's do it a little differently.
NEUT8|This week will start off with the Russell.
NEUT9|We looking at IWM.
NEUT10|One 9901 is what it closed that and if you recall last week I was looking forward to push to 200 and long behold the high is 199 ninety four six it's off.
BULL11|But we count that, so that's pretty good.
BULL12|We got our almost record high close and we should continue to push higher.
BULL13|That's a beautiful looking chart where it should continue to push.
NEUT14|So that is the Russell.
NEUT15|Let's go ahead and check out the S&P.
NEUT16|So SMP did identical numbers.
BEAR17|Almost closing towards his highs, the high record high is 3726 seventy and we closed at 3703.
BULL18|Oh six so that's pretty close and we also have a similar trend with it pushing higher and we got our levels identified.
NEUT19|3800 is where I see this pushing too as well.
BULL20|I WM should push towards that 200 again and from there it could continue to go.
NEUT21|I think we're going to surprise some people in January.
NEUT22|When the market continues to push an make more and more highs, so that's it.
NEUT23|Like I said, Merry Christmas.
BULL24|Happy New Year we'll return.
NEUT25|Enter this week.
NEUT26|Oh I'm sorry, yeah, enter this week.
NEUT27|Always think about weeks starting on Mondays so.
NEUT28|Enjoy it.
NEUT29|Hope everybody got the gifts they wanted.
NEUT30|And we'll see you next week.
NEUT31|"Alright, peace."""
