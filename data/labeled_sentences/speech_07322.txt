BEAR0|"""I think for many of these business leaders, even privately, they've been anxious about speaking out."
NEUT1|They have spoken out on issues of racial justice before, but they didn't see it in that perspective.
NEUT2|And also, if we're being honest, I think that that, at least in the state of Georgia, the CEOs of those big companies wanted to maintain a relationship with the governor, wanted to maintain a relationship with the Republicans who control that state and.
BEAR3|Are pushing all around on taxes and so many other issues and therefore didn't want to speak out and now they frankly have been forced to you.
NEUT4|Governor Kemp there saying this expands access and he also says most of these companies didn't have a problem until after it became a law.
NEUT5|Does he have a point there?
NEUT6|Well, it doesn't expand access.
NEUT7|I think it's in truth if you look if you look in the if you look in the areas that are hardest hit a clearly does not.
NEUT8|I also think that the companies and even the CEOs and people like Ken Chennault and Ken Frazier are it took, I think it almost took this moment to approve for them to appreciate what was taking place not only in Georgia, but how this could sweep the rest of the country.
BEAR9|And so their speaking out has now forced the issue an force.
NEUT10|The issue for so many.
NEUT11|Other CEOs, you know.
NEUT12|It seems like the easiest thing on Earth.
NEUT13|Should voting be easier or harder, right?
NEUT14|I mean, who says harder?
NEUT15|An if they do, what's their motive?
NEUT16|Those are the questions you always have to ask and they are now being asked.
BULL17|Yep, good deal, Andrew.
