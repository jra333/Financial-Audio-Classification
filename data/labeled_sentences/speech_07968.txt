NEUT0|"""The PEG ratio is the price earnings to growth ratio and we use it as a way to gauge the relative value of a stock versus the company's growth rate."
NEUT1|So again, let's define our terms here.
NEUT2|The price to earnings ratio you can look it up elsewhere on our side.
NEUT3|A little video on PE ratios.
NEUT4|That's the numerator.
NEUT5|The denominator is the growth rate of the company, and what this little mathematical expression is telling you is it's telling you to look at the PE ratio in the context of a company's growth rate.
NEUT6|In the year ahead, that's what the PEG ratio does.
NEUT7|How about an example?
NEUT8|Sure, let's take a quick example.
BULL9|OK, so let's say companies growing at 30% a year over the next year.
NEUT10|That's the market's expectation.
NEUT11|And let's say the stock is presently today trading at 25 times earnings.
NEUT12|Its PE ratio is 25.
NEUT13|Were doing the math together.
NEUT14|Numerators 25 That's the PE ratio.
NEUT15|That's the pet part of Peg Denominator is growth.
NEUT16|That's the good part of peg 25 / 30 in my example puts that yes, I know this map .8333.
NEUT17|It was your batting average in Little League, but .8333 would be or .83 would be the PEG ratio of that stock.
BEAR18|What it's telling you more simply is that the company is priced below its expected growth rate.
NEUT19|It would look cheaper.
BULL20|It looks cheaper than if it were the reverse.
NEUT21|Let's say I hope this isn't too much math.
NEUT22|Let's say the company is only growing at 25% of the next year and the PE ratio is 30.
BEAR23|We've reversed our numbers all of a sudden.
NEUT24|That looks like a more expensive stock.
NEUT25|Its price to the PE ratio that exceeds.
NEUT26|Its growth rate, let's bring it all together, remind ourselves all the PEG ratio does and it shouldn't be overstated what it can do.
NEUT27|All the PEG ratio does is it reminds you to look at the PE ratio of a stock in the context of the company's growth rate, and I think that's smart.
NEUT28|So, given the choice, you'd rather look at the PEG ratio than the PE ratio.
NEUT29|"Given the choice, if I could only look at either the PE ratio or the PEG ratio, I would emphatically look at the PEG ratio, because while it's certainly not a perfect measure and has lots of flaws itself, at least it tells me how a company stock is priced versus how its business is expected to perform in the near future."""
