BEAR0|"""This market is giving me a split personality including one day like today, with the NASDAQ Ward 1%."
BEAR1|As can be gained .27% and the Dow declined.
BULL2|86 points were about to get a set of unbelievably positive numbers from big retailers and restaurant chains, which is fabulous.
NEUT3|If you own the stocks.
NEUT4|But frankly it is horrifying if you think about why they are thriving.
NEUT5|This week we hear from Walmart, but I buy from Home Depot by by Lowe's and talk.
BEAR6|Bye bye now their stocks get hit for any reason.
BEAR7|Says it's also so you have to buy them because these major operators are up against general merchandisers, hardware stores, sporting goods stores and lumber yards is simply cannot compete because they were deemed non essential by the garment an I fear they'll never get those lost customers back.
NEUT8|Now with the prices these big guys charge.
NEUT9|The winners have so many advantages over the little guy that I'm amazed there still any competition whatsoever soon.
NEUT10|I have a fear that there won't be, and that's what's really driving me nuts.
NEUT11|I love when these big household names go higher, but I hate one of the reasons they're going higher.
BEAR12|Their small business competitors are being wiped out.
BULL13|A lot of these smaller outfits have been able to hold on to hold their own before covid but now the big guys have crafted phenomenal same day delivery services that only Amazon can beat anyone.
NEUT14|By the way, who's shipped from Target knows they can send you stuff within an hour.
NEUT15|Sometimes we use them for props on the show.
NEUT16|It's fabulous mom and pop outfits can't compete with that in the age of social distancing, we constantly hear that our economy is going through five years worth of technological change in a matter of months.
NEUT17|But that also includes retail and now the PPP's run out that was that government program gave you some money.
NEUT18|Now this is everybody's left to their own devices.
BEAR19|If anything, it's even worse for restaurants where PPP was so valuable.
NEUT20|Today Domino's announced that it needs 20,000 more delivery experts.
NEUT21|They need pizza makers, managers, assistant manager.
NEUT22|Now let's brainstorm on this together.
NEUT23|I mean, do you think they're hiring all these people because of a surge in demand for pizza versus burgers versus chicken versus anything else?
NEUT24|No, no, it's because they're taking share from smaller pizza parlors that are more reliant on indoor seating and don't have the same kind of delivery infrastructure.
NEUT25|Don't miss a second of mad money.
