NEUT8|The Coca Cola Company is about to release its quarter 4 earnings on February 10th.
BEAR9|At this time the Wall Street, expecting its sales, will also drop anywhere from 6% to 9%.
BULL10|However, based on AI robots research, it seems like a good buy at this moment.
BEAR11|For last quarter, Coca Cola's net sales dropped 9% to $8.65 billion.
BEAR12|Organic sales fell 6% and unit case volume, which helps measure demand without the impact of pricing or foreign currency declined 4%.
BEAR13|All four of Coke's drink categories reported declines in unit case volume.
BEAR14|Sparkling soft drinks was the least affected with its volume falling only 1%.
BEAR15|Demand for Coke 0 Sugar and trademark Coke drinks lifted the category, although overall it was hurt by the decline in the North American fountain business.
BEAR16|Juice, dairy and plant based drinks off volumes shrink by 6%, hurt by pressure in Asia Pacific and Latin America.
BEAR17|Unit case volume of water, enhanced water and sports drinks fell by 11%.
BEAR18|Tea and coffee was the hardest hit, with demand dropping 15%, primarily due to the company's caustica phase.
BULL19|While the pandemic continues to limit drink purchases at movie theaters, restaurants and office buildings, Coke said at home demand is still elevated.
BEAR20|Away from home volume fell by the mid teens last quarter, an improvement from its nadir of 50%, helped by higher sales at fast food restaurants and convenience stores.
BULL21|As it navigates the pandemic crisis, Coke is undergoing a transformation.
BEAR22|It is slimming its portfolio, cutting drinks like tab that haven't sold well and don't have much opportunity for growth.
BEAR23|The company recorded a $160 million impairment charge last quarter.
NEUT24|Tide to its Odwalla brand, which is also being discontinued.
BEAR25|At the end of the process it plans to slash the number of master brands by 50% to about 200.
NEUT26|In 2021, the rumor about the Coca Cola Company is that CBT drink might be formed with some other brands.
NEUT27|This is just a rumor.
NEUT28|AI Robot has no creditable source of it at this moment.
BULL29|However, AI Robot thinks that without CBT, drink the Coca Cola will do just fine in 2021.
BULL30|If the stock market is not crash, it will increase 15% for sure.
NEUT31|The reason that I mentioned the stock market crash is that the market risk is the one I cannot control.
NEUT32|It is the risk that is always there.
NEUT33|I am only able to understand and control the individual stock, not the market.
BULL34|Therefore, 15% increase in one year is 90% possible.
NEUT35|So please buy yourself some Coca Cola stock if you haven't.
