NEUT27|In our article about safe investments, if the pandemic gets worse, we mentioned a company that makes COVID-19 tests.
BULL28|They are likely to do very well no matter how the market does, and probably go up in price during a crash.
BEAR29|But when COVID-19 subsides, so will their stock.
BULL30|This could be a good short term investment during a market crash.
BULL31|On the other hand, a company like Microsoft has gone up from $150 a share to $230 a share this year.
BULL32|Their rally in the face of the pandemic is partially because of the movement to online work, which is very likely to continue once the pandemic subsides.
BULL33|Companies have found ways to function just as well as before and with fewer expenses by having their employees till a commute.
BULL34|Microsoft is therefore a good long term bet and could be picked up at an attractive price when the next crash occurs.
