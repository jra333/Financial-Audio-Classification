NEUT0|"""Yeah, let's do Citrix."
NEUT1|Paul CTXS.
NEUT2|There we go.
NEUT3|Citrix Systems what's the market cap on this puppy?
NEUT4|$15 billion to the company is worth 15 billion if you buy it all out right now.
NEUT5|P ratio 27.
NEUT6|Not terribly insane, but high.
BEAR7|Especially this big run up in the stock.
NEUT8|There's probably some room there to show that it can drop.
BULL9|27 is an X profit margin, so this is surprising.
NEUT10|Profit margin only 13% and their gross profit profit margin.
BEAR11|84% I'm kind of surprised to see this low profit margin.
NEUT12|Bottom line is still a check mark.
NEUT13|How about pillar?
BULL14|#3 is revenue growth over the past five years.
BEAR15|Paul Pillar number 32.652 point 762.833 very slow growth.
BEAR16|Checkmark profit growth is code #4 three 19536 loss of 20.
BEAR17|I guarantee there's some sort of write off here 570-5681 massive check Mark.
NEUT18|I like.
NEUT19|These numbers are nice and steady growth pillar #5 number shares outstanding pole look at this 159 million down to 1:30 so these guys are taking their free cash flow.
NEUT20|Buying shares back so another check mark.
NEUT21|How about building #6?
NEUT22|Is current assets greater than current?
NEUT23|Liabilities poem software companies tend to be very good about this.
NEUT24|1.7 billion in current assets.
NEUT25|Current cash on hand 1.0.
NEUT26|Guys, that's kind of surprising, but over history it looks like they have this XA lot kind of surprising for a software business.
NEUT27|I'd want to understand why that is for this company.
NEUT28|Pillar #7 free cash flow growth with his cash from operations minus capital expenditures all pay attention.
NEUT29|This one Paul loves this one 930,000,000 one billion 829-5710.
NEUT30|So this is an X is decreasing.
NEUT31|This is an X on the free cash flow growth.
BEAR32|They are decreasing their free cash flow.
NEUT33|What do you have in average?
NEUT34|Uncles, uncles, eight, 8880 * 20?
BEAR35|17.6 It's actually a check mark here guys from a free cash flow perspective is selling for 20 times when they want to say is that a drop in free cash flow last year, but it looks like the previous 12 months it's actually up in the last 12 months.
NEUT36|Their free cash flow is at a little under a billion dollars, so this might be by who suggested this woman like this is a pretty good one.
NEUT37|What do you know about them?
NEUT38|We should it be interesting to find out more about this company.
BULL39|They can easily afford their dividend by five times over.
NEUT40|The only thing I don't like about it that profit margin.
NEUT41|I'm not a huge fan of and the free cash flow dropping over the last few years, but rebounding now.
NEUT42|"Understand why that is."""
