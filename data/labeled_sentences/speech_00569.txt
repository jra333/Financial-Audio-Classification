NEUT0|"""So the pick of the week so far is SIG Signet Jewelers Limited."
NEUT1|We spotted this this stock on Friday just after the close on Friday.
NEUT2|We notice this was approaching a nice nice break of the wedge.
NEUT3|Or of this trend, I should say?
BULL4|We had this on watch from Monday and as you can see it made a nice break.
NEUT5|Of this trend, let me pull it up on the one minute here.
NEUT6|Here, let's zoom that out.
NEUT7|There we go.
NEUT8|Obviously you can see this was Friday here.
BEAR9|It was creeping down and as it approached this trend here.
BULL10|It started to make a nice little.
NEUT11|Obviously the test.
NEUT12|You know, retest.
BEAR13|And finally the fade out and this thing just couldn't hold, so it eventually faded out to our target price number one of 2593.
BEAR14|And then today it got hammered down pretty good and there was no.
NEUT15|There was no real news that was pushing this down today.
NEUT16|So this is strictly a technical setup, at least in my opinion.
NEUT17|So it broke target one creep down nicely to target too.
NEUT18|But now watch what happens on target to it gets it tests here.
NEUT19|Test again and holds so for tomorrow what you'll see if it pops down a bit again right?
NEUT20|With another, hold an push up at the end.
NEUT21|So what we're going to look for tomorrow is if we if we can break.
NEUT22|If we can break this this tight range here between 2507 to 2498.
NEUT23|If we can start to break that and see that come down, provided that the spy is working with us, I think we can see this thing drop down too.
NEUT24|Zoom this up here down to target #3.
NEUT25|Maybe not in one day, but I believe this thing can start to come down and test these levels here, so we're going to keep this close watch for tomorrow, which would be Wednesday the 10th.
BULL26|And we're going to.
NEUT27|We're going to see if we can.
NEUT28|We can make another move on this one.
NEUT29|"So TuneIn later on in the week and and see how it goes."""
