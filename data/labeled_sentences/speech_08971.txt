BEAR0|"""Clearly you are feeling a fresh round of pain right now."
NEUT1|What is your strategy?
NEUT2|What are you buying?
NEUT3|What are you selling?
NEUT4|Well, we keep our eye on the prize.
NEUT5|We have a five year time horizon and actually when we go through a route like this, first of all is the rotation.
NEUT6|Now is happening very quickly.
BULL7|It started off slowly and is happening quickly so I'm happy that the market is broadening out.
NEUT8|This was this was the case in late 16 as well.
BULL9|Value took off and left growth behind and whenever I see that happen I say OK this bull market has broadened out.
BULL10|This is good news.
NEUT11|What we do during these periods is concentrate our portfolios towards our highest conviction names and so that's what we're doing.
NEUT12|We had extended the number of names in the portfolio from the low to mid 30s at the bottom of the coronavirus, and now we're at roughly 55 for our flagship fund and we are starting to sell the more liquid names and buy some of the more pureplay names so the the more liquid names are either more mature, the.
NEUT13|Facebooks the apples and so forth or and or they are.
NEUT14|Participating in innovation, but they're not pure plays, so regenerx on Novartis and so forth.
BULL15|So more liquid in order to have cash like instruments to use at a time like now and move again concentrate towards our highest conviction names.
NEUT16|So let's talk about Tesla.
NEUT17|Then you said that you were only going to buy the dip.
BEAR18|Are you going to continue to buy the Tesla dip now that it's dipping even lower?
NEUT19|Yes, we can buy a stock up to 10% of our portfolios, and that's certainly in the ETF's.
NEUT20|We were report our Holdings at the end of every day, so anyone can see that.
BULL21|And yes, we have been building whenever we can.
BULL22|Now we built up to 10% last week, so the stock behaved in line with our portfolio, so again we can't buy anymore here.
BEAR23|If it were to deteriorate at a rate.
BEAR24|Beyond that of our other portfolio, so drop below that 10%.
NEUT25|"We would then have the latitude to buy more of course."""
