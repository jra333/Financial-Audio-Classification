NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know she would behave."
NEUT1|We back with another one that's going right into it.
NEUT2|You know, we're not waste nobody time before we do that let's get this video.
BULL3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people than we touching bases on sundial growers.
NEUT4|SSN DL.
NEUT5|So we want to basically just be doing a brief update.
NEUT6|A little summary over to stop letting you know what to expect.
NEUT7|Long term short term giving you some reassurance in it.
NEUT8|Stop 'cause I know a lot of investors out there.
NEUT9|You know you are seeing premarket is following and probably getting scared.
NEUT10|I just wanna let you know that I feel during market so the market open I could see.
BULL11|Send our growers possibly pushing up under that 140 and we could, possibly we gotta support around $1.43.
BEAR12|We gotta support around 1:43 if we fall below that 141 I could see is falling down to around 1:31.
BEAR13|We could file down in 131 or one 34135 pretty quickly soon as soon as after we fall down and re touch that research.
BULL14|That level we can quickly spiked back up.
NEUT15|Spike vehicle he won 40 year break that 140 and go straight to one feet.
NEUT16|And let's look at the chart guys we see.
BULL17|We got a strong resistance on sundial growers around dollars.
NEUT18|$0.66 right at dollars $0.66.
NEUT19|This is a strong strong resistance point, so if we break $1.66 cents guys we this thing is going to fly fast rate to two dollars 208 to be exact, we want to soon as we break 166 that 166 more preferably around 170, soon as we break that we're going straight to 208 and once we get the 28.
BULL20|219 will be the last resistance point that we had to break through before we can revisit and touch the high that we had on February 10th, 2021 of 2095 cents.
NEUT21|219 will be our last resistant points before we can retest there.
BULL22|295 and I feel like this week will be a strong week for the marijuana sector and I told you I I always tell you SND L that's why I graduated from S&DS and I grew.
NEUT23|I still got a few thousand could invest it but I just keep it there and just sitting.
NEUT24|Because it's in, the deal is the lager like it?
NEUT25|Love the lag behind?
NEUT26|Just like in every in every sector there is a a company.
NEUT27|They like the lag behind is the sleeper while everybody else is moving going forward and going up the EB.
NEUT28|This one company that love the lag behind and I always peep out which company it is in the blockchain sector with SOS Mara Riot and now dealing with simply play the Bitcoin SOS is doing this always lagging always following behind.
NEUT29|Hard to keep up and with the marijuana sector.
NEUT30|Is in the year sundial.
NEUT31|Growers is the one that's always lagging behind.
NEUT32|I always hard to keep up OG I be done.
NEUT33|Flew off Tyrion be done, flew out.
NEUT34|ASB will be done, flew out and S and deal between when it's lagging behind.
NEUT35|Scared to take out so and that's a part of manipulation in the stock price so you know SN DL will fly is destined to fly.
BULL36|We can see all the pullback in the world and hopefully in worst case scenario this name pull all way back.
NEUT37|To $0.80 ninety cents you wanted just load the boat to this thing will fly.
NEUT38|It just lags behind.
NEUT39|It weights and legs and try to get all weekend scared investors out before it do what it has to do.
NEUT40|So I just want to give you a quick update on S and the yield.
NEUT41|And the channel was really going on with them, so that's all I really got this video.
NEUT42|She like these type of quick updates.
NEUT43|These are predictions out there.
NEUT44|Good stuff.
NEUT45|Consider joining the family.
NEUT46|We drop this type of stuff every single day and we love you.
BULL47|God bless.
NEUT48|"We are."""
