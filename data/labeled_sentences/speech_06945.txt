BEAR0|"""Amazon technicals don't look great."
BEAR1|I still think the stocks story stock.
NEUT2|I still think it's Amazon.
NEUT3|I still think eventually it's going to 5000, but it looks like I could cool off here at that if I wasn't long Amazon for long long term.
NEUT4|I'd probably sell it and then try to re get it by always knows what happens when I go my long term portfolio and I sell stock.
NEUT5|I think I'm gonna get cheaper then it blasts off and I miss it and I don't really buy it.
NEUT6|And then I'm mad at myself two years later.
NEUT7|So try not to do that with the Amazon, but as right now that Amazon Shirt looks tired.
NEUT8|Yeah, look at all those loans that you've had just below 3100.
NEUT9|And then when it came down there and early October, it bounced right up, right to 3200.
NEUT10|And now you're coming down here again in your not bouncing right up and that you know something when you hang out.
NEUT11|Support for too long.
NEUT12|You tend to take it out, so I would just use yesterday's low as you know, as a parameter on the downside.
NEUT13|And then I don't know are we going to get under 3000?
NEUT14|I mean, I think they'd really have to hit the market on this one.
NEUT15|I don't think this headlines could do it possibly could.
BULL16|I mean, it's had a great run this year.
NEUT17|Maybe this one like wow.
NEUT18|30 at this point it's not even hitting it here this morning.
NEUT19|It just.
BEAR20|Overall, I mean, look out the weekly's eye looks a little bit exhausted.
NEUT21|It's look at the monthly.
NEUT22|Just look at the monthly's two down here in the bottom right corner you need to hold.
NEUT23|If you know you need to hold the whole 3000 psychological level, and then maybe we dip below it and shake a few people out again.
NEUT24|I mean, we know if we get down below 3000 could hit some stops, so maybe this is one of those undercutting rally type trades.
NEUT25|You know that we always talk with Gil Morales about.
NEUT26|He loves the undercutting rally.
NEUT27|Maybe get under 3000, hit a few stops under there, and then maybe you know.
NEUT28|Pass backup and then you strike.
BEAR29|But right now I'd layoff.
NEUT30|"I'm long Amazon, I'm staying long Amazon, but then I'd lay off right now."""
