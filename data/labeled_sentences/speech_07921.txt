NEUT0|"""Today I'd like to describe for you what a stock split is and what it means for the everyday investor."
NEUT1|Now, if you have a stock split announced by a company, it means that they want to offer multiple shares for what is currently an outstanding share on the market.
BEAR2|So in other words, the stock is splitting.
NEUT3|You can go from one share of ownership stake to two or four or whatever the company has in mind.
NEUT4|But the end of the day, your ownership interest in the company as a whole does not change, but you also do not see the market cap of the company change the day that it's announced.
NEUT5|In the day that it's actually taking takes place, the company will trade in a market cap the same as prior to the announcement.
NEUT6|So to put this into an example, if you own one share and you paid $100 to get into a company that has ten million shares outstanding on the market, well, what they might want to do is decrease the share price down to $50 a share and now they have 20 million shares on the market.
NEUT7|Now if you add those up, you essentially have the exact same market capitalization of the company, but they now have more shares available and the overall market cap hasn't changed, but perhaps.
NEUT8|Sometimes investors might argue that there's more liquidity, so there's a lot more investors that might be willing to get into a $50 commitment to owner own a part of the company as opposed to $100 commitment.
NEUT9|Now the research out there isn't not completely proven that that is true, and you have companies like Berkshire Hathaway, the trade North of 100 and $29,000 per share.
NEUT10|You also have Apple at somewhere around $700.00 per share right now.
NEUT11|You know, there's not.
NEUT12|There's not a clear cut way as to why companies do want to do this.
NEUT13|Sometimes it relates to the index.
NEUT14|They might be apart of, like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones.
NEUT15|But at the end of the day, as investors need to understand you're taking one share and you're turning in multiple shares for the investor and the market cap of the company hasn't changed your intrinsic value and your ownership stake haven't changed, but it's something to really keep in mind as you hear these announcements come from time to time.
