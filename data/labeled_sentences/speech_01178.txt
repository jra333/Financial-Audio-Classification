NEUT0|"""What's up everybody."
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
BULL2|Hope you guys are having a fantastic weekend.
NEUT3|And before I get started this one quickly mention.
NEUT4|Once again I have the link to my discord in description where I have over 875 members.
NEUT5|We have a great community in there, so feel free to join and check that out if you haven't already.
NEUT6|Other than that, let's get right into this video.
NEUT7|So in tonight's video only going over Marathon patent group.
NEUT8|Their ticker symbol is Mara and for those who don't know, they are a company involved in mining, crypto currencies and Bitcoin and things like that.
NEUT9|And that's the reason behind.
BEAR10|Tonight's video is because of Bitcoin surge.
BULL11|In just the past week, if we take a look at this, you can see they're up 26.32% or about $6950 in just the past week.
BEAR12|Bring them up to a total of 33,300 per coin, so obviously this massive rally should have some sort of an impact in a positive direction on both Mara an riot, but if we take a look at Riot you can see that they are a little bit overextended in my opinion.
NEUT13|Will cover them briefly in just a second, but you can see that currently there are $16.81 on the monthly chart.
BULL14|You can see that they are up 92.90%, and I do think that Mara is the better company out of the two.
NEUT15|They actually have sold off about 25% in just the past week.
NEUT16|We take a look at them here in just a second.
BEAR17|You can see they're down $3.51 or 25.07% in just the past week.
BEAR18|Bring them down to a total of $10.49.
BULL19|I do think that this is a pretty solid entry right here at this price point.
NEUT20|If we go ahead and break them down here on thinkorswim on the yearly chart, you can see that they do look like a goodbye right here with Bitcoin rallying.
NEUT21|If I zoom in on this section, you can see the Mac doesn't look too promising right here.
NEUT22|It does look like it could be curling down.
BULL23|But with his Bitcoin news, I do expect them to bounce back, but go ahead and zoom in even a little bit more.
BEAR24|You can see they have sold off pretty sharply from highs of about $14.66.
BULL25|I do believe it was slightly higher.
NEUT26|They pulled back all way down to this nine Ma, which is this blue line we broke below it, and now they're currently trading between the 13 Ma, which is this yellow line and the nine ma being this light blueish line right there.
NEUT27|Do you think they will have a nice bounce off of this and I keep continuing to trend upwards as you can see if I zoom out a little bit more.
BULL28|This is a healthy pullback.
NEUT29|They did kind of shoot up.
NEUT30|Too much and too short of a time span.
BEAR31|I do think that they definitely need a pull back like this.
BEAR32|Going to break them down on 180 day chart.
NEUT33|You can see kind of the same thing.
NEUT34|We go ahead and zoom in right here.
BULL35|You can see Mac D looks much better on this time frame.
NEUT36|The high actually was $15.50 but as you can see my current resistance line looks to be about $10.80 by zoom in even a little bit more you can see and do you think they actually are hitting a support line right about here?
NEUT37|A pretty minor one.
BULL38|At $10.10 they did bounce off of that and they closed the day at $10 and.
NEUT39|$0.46 that you have all the emmas kind of curling downwards right here.
BULL40|But once they break these, I do think it's so form a massive support line they'll bounce up and create new all time highs.
NEUT41|Especially with all these crypto currencies.
NEUT42|Just absolutely ripping.
NEUT43|Go ahead and breakdown some of the option plays that you could be playing on Mara this week.
NEUT44|Something I'd recommend doing is a long term swing trade or long term call option.
NEUT45|I should say I would do something really safe like January 21st of 2022.
NEUT46|You can see that these really aren't too bad.
NEUT47|This one right here that that money strike the $12.00 call is only going to cost you $605.00 up front.
NEUT48|Look at the Greeks.
NEUT49|You can see it has extremely high Delta of $78, an extremely low Theta of less than $1.68.
NEUT50|Just a fantastic play.
NEUT51|I definitely would recommend buying into this specific option this week.
NEUT52|Do you think will be well above $12.00 by the 21st of 2022?
NEUT53|This does give you well over a year on this option and like I said, relatively no time decay yet.
NEUT54|Extremely high Delta.
BULL55|This could be a very profitable trade, so if you're looking into them for the long term and think that cryptocurrency is going to continue upwards and that Mara and Ryan are going to continue to play a big impact in that.
NEUT56|And definitely pick up this call option right here.
NEUT57|The $12.00 call expiring January 21st of 2022.
NEUT58|But then that guys that is about it for this video.
