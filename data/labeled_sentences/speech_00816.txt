NEUT0|"""Jim, let's start with you."
NEUT1|Do stock splits matter in an era where you can have fractional trading?
NEUT2|I mean what is going on with this stock right now.
NEUT3|Well academically, you would say an for the value of the company.
NEUT4|It does not.
NEUT5|But for retail investors and for stocks that are commonly talked about while you have breakfast, lunch or dinner as a family and you talk about family planning of wealth and stuff like that and retail investors own those stocks, it actually does matter and it simply adds the better ability for people to buy whole shares.
NEUT6|Now, fractional trading as you mentioned is available and so versus, you know, a decade or two ago, it's less.
NEUT7|Important on that fraction versus whole share basis, but for the average consumer retail out there, it does matter a little bit, but the total value of the company academically would say no.
NEUT8|But we all know the real world doesn't always function and academics and we believe yes, it does help.
BULL9|It helps attract more mom and pops college children and people like that who simply want to buy a couple shares.
NEUT10|You know, maybe a couple shares full shares for each child to give to them.
NEUT11|Well, doesn't matter if Apple has more retail investors.
NEUT12|I mean, this company is now valued at more than $2 trillion.
NEUT13|30 times estimated earnings according to Refin Ative you know, is Apple fully valued here?
NEUT14|Does it need additional retail support at these levels?
NEUT15|I don't know that it needs additional retail support, but the end of the day it's incremental buyers and sellers that move stock, right?
NEUT16|So you know anything that can move the stock in a positive direction.
BULL17|He is going to be helpful, but look I think that the bigger drivers right now is that the fundamentals of the company and this is a company that put up an epic quarter.
NEUT18|When you look back at fiscal Q3 in the midst of pandemic, know grew year over year and every geography, every product line, and of course you got the 5G cycle on tap.
NEUT19|And so we think those are still the bigger drivers.
NEUT20|We've been long term believers in the power of the ecosystems, the benefits that they drive from that.
NEUT21|We think much of that is, is still out in front of them despite notice this passage, Lucas had a blast.
NEUT22|Others so.
NEUT23|But well, let me follow up on that.
BEAR24|I mean, anybody who's obviously been negative on Apple's been dead wrong.
NEUT25|No doubt about that.
BULL26|But Dan Niles, you know, noted technology investor just we did at over $2 trillion market cap stocks up with 70% this year.
BEAR27|You know, it has the worst revenue growth of its peers for 2020 at 4% when you compound the last five years, which is revenue growth of 6%.
NEUT28|He just questions whether 38 multiple is deserved for this name, or whether it's going to back off at all, given there are other companies with far higher.
BULL29|Our revenue growth rates.
NEUT30|Look, you know it did.
NEUT31|David it's a fair question and and it's possible.
BEAR32|Stocks you overheat it agreed near term.
NEUT33|You know, I think you know if you look at the long term opportunities, you know we think there's still ecosystem benefits.
NEUT34|You ahead of them.
NEUT35|As we pointed out, this is typically a stock you want to own in part of the next big product cycle.
NEUT36|Of course, the 5G product cycle you know is right in front of us, and I think the other thing to keep in mind here is I think investors are increasingly in this environment.
BULL37|Putting a premium on visibility which is benefiting in large part from the work.
NEUT38|Homeworld the school from Home World that we're in and you know apples been a big beneficiary of that.
BEAR39|"I think those trends right now are trumping what we're seeing on the valuation concern."""
