BULL0|"""Good afternoon everyone you've seen here from the North American desk."
BULL1|So I've been searching for technology's office this morning that are fundamentally sound, but I've been under slight pressure these past couple of days, so we found an interesting technical setup that we want to share with you guys today.
NEUT2|Now it might not be a big buy, but it's definitely something to add to your watch this before it shoots it alive.
NEUT3|So let's take a look at the daily chart of Netflix ticker and FLX.
NEUT4|Now they can look at David chart.
BEAR5|Here we can see that the prices have been ranging within a bullish channel that's been in place since the month of March.
BULL6|We can see that the prices are trading around the 50 day moving average here and are at the lower end of the channel, so we're definitely expecting a rebound to our targets.
NEUT7|Now, taking a look at the ratio here at the bottom.
BULL8|We can see that's been also ranging within a bullish channel that's been in place since around the summer of 2016.
BEAR9|Now this means that the stock is clearly outperforming the S&P 500.
BULL10|So that being said, we do expect some ******** mountain on the sock towards their targets at the recent have 191 and 210 which actually intersects with the upper end of the bullish channel.
BEAR11|And we have a stop loss at 164.5, which is actually a significant overlap.
NEUT12|Now fresh, do trade.
NEUT13|Below are stop loss.
BULL14|We do expect them to reach either 146 or 129.
