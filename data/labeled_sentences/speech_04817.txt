NEUT4|By connecting the swing highs and lows using trendlines, a symmetrical triangle pattern forms.
NEUT5|This technical formation forecasts a 40% breakout, which is the distance between the swing high and low created on March 11th and 12.
BULL6|Since this setup has no bias, a decisive close above $0.38 will result in a 40% bull run to 54 cents.
BEAR7|On the other hand, a breakdown of the lower trendline at $0.31 will kickstart a downward trend to $0.19.
BEAR8|And increased seller activity at the current price will quickly push Polygon Tord, the lower trend line.
BEAR9|However, a breakout here will spell trouble for the modest price.

BEAR21|While the downward breakout seems set in stone, it could be altered by a strong surge in buyers or new capital flowing into the mortgage markets.
BEAR22|If this momentum manage is to push the price past the $0.40 supply barrier and create a higher high around $0.45, it will invalidate the bearish outlook.
