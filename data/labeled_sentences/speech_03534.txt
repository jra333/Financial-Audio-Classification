NEUT0|"""Is getting a weekly top 50 welcome back?"
NEUT1|Is the 22nd of December 2020, Tuesday, the 2nd day of the week.
NEUT2|We're at #32 Avery Whitiker 8th obviously, so for Eva games BDC we are.
BEAR3|It looks pretty weak do against PC.
NEUT4|Think about it, is that we have really touched the skinny pink line.
NEUT5|One thing which I don't really like at the moment.
NEUT6|You just keep in mind this means that potentially AF could already be in the process of going lower, right?
BULL7|So we could be reaching the skinny pink line and starting a new bearish trend for a.
NEUT8|Maybe yes, maybe no.
NEUT9|I don't really see any clear.
BEAR10|Trend reversals yet here we are still in a bullish trend.
BULL11|Mind you, the trend is still bullish, so potentially going to see if continue higher as well.
NEUT12|Is this good app?
NEUT13|So freaking lonely happened?
NEUT14|There is no guarantees that we're going to fall yet.
NEUT15|No clear chapiters yet.
NEUT16|So here are going to be very, very careful once you're sleeping.
NEUT17|More likely than not, you will be packaging through.
NEUT18|More likely than not.
NEUT19|But again, we still don't see that right, and so we're just going to move on, right?
NEUT20|So there plenty of other coins to trade and shouldn't be stuck to only.
NEUT21|One nice well do it again.
NEUT22|See SDT, but before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT23|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about it in the comments below for Eve against US GT.
BEAR24|Yeah this is not looking good.
NEUT25|Why would I say that?
NEUT26|Yeah, this is a shooting star, right?
NEUT27|Shooting stars are usually bearish reversals, and so I think that's a could be in the midst of forming a Paris.
NEUT28|Chop it, and we're going to get a head and shoulders.
NEUT29|Yes, no, maybe you again in terms of trade ability.
NEUT30|I don't see any clear tradeable chapters 48.
NEUT31|I'm not saying we can't go any higher, I'm just saying that we're not really clear off the short term direction of eight.
NEUT32|Moreover, if you look over here, there is a triple.
BEAR33|Bearish divergent, absolutely triple berries, divergents higher high, higher high, higher high lower high lower high, lower high on the mic, D lower high lower high lower high on the RSI, triple Berry divergent.
BEAR34|This means that potentially there could be a big reversal coming on for a against USD test.
NEUT35|It's just no guarantees that we're going to go any higher, so you gotta be very very, very, very careful because if you see me like potentially we could be reversing lower.
NEUT36|Maybe not immediately.
NEUT37|We might still see.
NEUT38|A rally is just that.
BEAR39|It's just not looking good for USD.
NEUT40|Triple bearish divergences really there, so watch out.
NEUT41|Be careful, alright, I guess it from my ethical analysis.
BULL42|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL43|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT44|"I'll see you in the next video."""
