BULL0|"""Tesla is in focus today that stock surging to a record high amid a credit rating upgrade just before it joins the S&P 500 index."
NEUT1|The new index with Tesla begins trading on Monday, but all the trading action is actually going to happen at the close today.
NEUT2|Yahoo Finance's Ethan Wolfman is here now with what we can expect an even I know some investors are bracing for fireworks here at the close.
NEUT3|What it what can we expect?
NEUT4|And that's the idea.
NEUT5|Everything kind of has to be getting get in, you know, at the wire at you know when the trading day ends.
NEUT6|And so I think this is going to be really interesting.
NEUT7|And we had Howard Silverblatt of SNP earlier today talking about how they expect some serious Chernin kind of interesting market movements at the end of the day.
NEUT8|But you know one thing that I've been looking at is, you know what the what the company's inclusion into the index is going to mean.
NEUT9|So many people love investing by the index.
NEUT10|Specifically, the S&P 500 index and you know, looking at some notes out, Goldman had an interesting one.
BULL11|I think it's really worth looking at that you know the 600 plus percent that Tesla was up this year would have if it had been included in the index raised the SNP's performance from around 16% to 18%.
NEUT12|So this is the this is kind of the idea of the type of move that will kind of require a significant change in the SP 500.
NEUT13|From a company like Tesla, so if you're worried about, you know this enormous company, the largest ever that's been included, you know, sorry, that's been added to.
NEUT14|We have six companies that are bigger.
NEUT15|I think that's really interesting to see and something that a lot of people would be worried about going forward, but it probably will not be that big of a deal.
NEUT16|I know that initially there was talk about it adding Tesla in two tranches, which is usually how a company is added to the index, but they decided to do this in one.
NEUT17|Why did they decide to do that an?
BEAR18|Is there concern that perhaps the market won't be able to keep up with the flurry of activity that we're expected to see here on the clothes?
NEUT19|I mean, I think it just makes more sense to do it in one fell swoop.
NEUT20|It's one company you know over 80% of its free float is going into the into the S&P 500 index.
NEUT21|You know that is a lot of churn silverblatt today said, you know that was about $85 billion worth of trading, which is a lot and you know it's important to remember that when people who are running index funds are buying $85 billion of Tesla, they also have to sell $85 billion.
NEUT22|Of something else, and so that could kind of increase the activity of things being dumped at the same time.
NEUT23|But you know, I think people have had a month to plan for this.
NEUT24|This is not a surprise to anybody, so I think the that element from these professionals will kind of make things a bit calmer than the otherwise might be.
NEUT25|This is something that you know SMB has done before and there is protocol to be followed.
NEUT26|And I think that you will see some craziness at the Bell probably, but it'll be fine.
BULL27|Yeah, good point there.
NEUT28|They have had some time to plan for this one.
BULL29|"Alright, Ethan Wolf man thanks so much."""
