NEUT0|"""Tell you too, but today will be talking about BFT stock."
NEUT1|BFT is going to be merging with a company called Pay Safe so I do kind of went over a little bit about the BFT's analysis, Prosper, Dacian and also some merger news.

NEUT6|We were sitting right on any resistance almost at 1591.
BULL7|There were around $0.31 away and then we might break the resistance going above back up into the around the $17.00 mark for BFT stock.
BEAR8|Recently we've seen a quite a bit of a downfall, definitely coming after earnings.
BEAR9|We sent it dropped from around the 16 all the way down to a low of 1250.
BEAR10|So now I want to talk about, you know, some of the movement that is coming with me FT stock, so the volume was a lot lower on Friday at 5.1 million, with an average 10 day volume at 7.5 million.
NEUT11|This market cap is sitting right around 2.8 bill for the FT when BFT an paysafe merge gets an exact date.
NEUT12|Will see a big movement coming closer to that date and when the merger happened we see some volatility coming to the stock but let's just go ahead and go over a little bit about some volatility that we see in the call options already.
BEAR13|So let's talk about the call options on Friday the stock price move down to $15.94.
BEAR14|We got to a low of 1560, was down almost 2% on the day.
NEUT15|The option top was sweet with the trade Couva call expiration date of.
NEUT16|April 16th, 2021.
BEAR17|But the strike price of $17.50.
NEUT18|We've seen a volume of 828 with an open interest of 20,000 so big reason why they can be an indicator of why this could be going 'cause we could see some potential news.
NEUT19|There's also another penny stock that had a huge amount of volatility come onto their call options for April 16th as well.
NEUT20|And that was my previous video SCS stock and that was a penny stock.
BULL21|I do believe that BFT is going to see some movement here soon.
BULL22|I think that we're going to potentially see around the 17 to $18.00 once we break there.
NEUT23|This back dominated the EV sector back in 2020, VFT and Paysafe is going to be the person that they are merging with a company that offers online and in store payment processing.
BEAR24|And I do want to mention that the last time we had seen it come from around the $16.00 mark we hadn't seen it fell around 20% going down to 12:50 and that was due to earnings.
BULL25|But I do think BFT is going to hold up and probably go around the 17 to $18.00 with in summer of 2021.
NEUT26|We can see this potentially if paysafe does get a merger date and whenever the merge.
NEUT27|Is actually going through.
BEAR28|We could see this big potential run upcoming on BFT stock.
BULL29|I think this stock could easily go past the all time high in 1957.
BULL30|Going back up until the 20 to the $25.00 range pretty quickly whenever Paysafe merger does come through and we started seeing some revenue coming from Paysafe and getting some earnings reports on their company as I do think BFT is going to be a good long term stock.
