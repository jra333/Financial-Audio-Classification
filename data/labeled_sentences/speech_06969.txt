NEUT0|"""Speaking of learning about stocks, two stocks for our audience to watch."
BULL1|Thanks, Scott.
NEUT2|Alright, so the first one will talk about is Treasury wine Estates mate.
BEAR3|It's a business that has been absolutely smashed.
NEUT4|Again, we talked about China a little bit earlier.
NEUT5|I just don't see how I'm not automatic investor.
BULL6|If you look forward 5 and 1015 years we know the growth of Australia in China's massive 20% growth in volume.
NEUT7|Another 20 top of that in price.
NEUT8|How that doesn't continue for the foreseeable future with some bumps and lumps and quarantines and government meddling.
NEUT9|Absolutely how Chinese under heat.
NEUT10|More Australian wine in 10 years time out today.
NEUT11|I can't think of anything more.
NEUT12|Likely not certain, but likely Treasury is so cheap right now its prices if it's never gonna happen, I'm that's a great opportunity.
NEUT13|You're buying the existing business at good value and you getting effectively what's now because of the price of free option of that Chinese growth either really, really great opportunity.
NEUT14|Really good perspective as you look forward to think about what might happen.
NEUT15|Again, really high quality brands can charge a fortune for them.
BULL16|I think Treasury is a great buy.
NEUT17|And the other stop.
NEUT18|I wanna play with Australian ethical investment Smite so there are ethical fund manager.
NEUT19|I don't actually think ethical investing works for the record but again like like afterpains, if I know one thing to me there is no clear sense that whether you own BHP, Ryan BHP or isolator useful out of it makes no difference.
NEUT20|For BHP does the whole concept ethical investing I think is flawed.
NEUT21|I take no pride in saying that by the way, but I'd like to think it could work in some cases.
NEUT22|There are simple.
NEUT23|Reality is it's not going to work, but it's not going to stop anybody from thinking.
NEUT24|It does show Nichols in the box seat to really get some.
NEUT25|Good price as quickly millennials a change their super and basically add more to super overtime.
NEUT26|Ethical investing will continue to be a bigger and bigger share of the Australian market.
BULL27|Australian ethical, as the name says, invest ethically and they've got a really great presence in social media reputation.
NEUT28|Word of mouth.
NEUT29|I think Australia computer really, really well it will be volatile as the market moves around because we know all fund managers are leveraged.
BULL30|Bets on the market, but I think the combination of market recovery is going to happen over time and you'll get more market share as people look for ethical investments.
NEUT31|Like strong ethical, a really good option.
NEUT32|Yeah, so Australian ethical investment and Treasury wine.
NEUT33|"Scotts pigsty."""
