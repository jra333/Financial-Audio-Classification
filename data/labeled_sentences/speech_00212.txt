NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol PHUN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|You're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Quite eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT8|More cycling would make this chart look the absolute best going forward, and that would be the price can stay up there above $2.20.
NEUT9|I don't get me wrong.
BEAR10|The price falls below 220.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL12|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move.
NEUT16|That right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT19|The Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT21|Yeah, stand up to 20 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT22|Nothing fancy or complicated here.
NEUT23|Party stopped today several times, right up there around $2.30.
NEUT24|So you're going to want to keep a close eye on that, but then of 2:30 can be broken.
NEUT25|Let me squeeze on the charter a little bit.
NEUT26|Next, key overarching level of resistance after that will then be up there right around $2.45.
NEUT27|So keep running those couple areas moving forward, but on all any angle you look at it.
BULL28|Great movement today, not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL33|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
