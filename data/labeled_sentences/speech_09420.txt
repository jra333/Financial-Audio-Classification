NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol CIDM."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another very eventful day in this one big volume, big price movement.
NEUT5|Although I will say that now from a presentation standpoint where I sit and extremely tricky chart to talk about 'cause there's just a whole lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT6|What do I mean by that?
NEUT7|Well, if you're some sort of daytrader, flipper, scalper, whatever you want to call yourself, and you were buying up around here in your plan was to buy in South in 20 minutes.
BEAR8|Well, then from that perspective, the chart looks really, really bad.
BULL9|Now, if you care about things from the grand scheme of it all from the bigger picture, I understand there was a large pullback today, but from the grand scheme of it all, the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT10|And that's how long term uptrends are constructed.
NEUT11|Higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time, and that's going to viewpoint that I talk about things from.
NEUT12|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had more of a charter type mentality going into all this, and I'm not saying that all of this was going to actually happen, but from an explanation standpoint, let's say that the price actually pulls back some more.
BEAR13|And goes down there to $1.55.
NEUT14|So price comes down here to Dollar 55 and then levels out in search of curl back upwards.
NEUT15|Now emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT16|What would you have?
NEUT17|Well, you have said all those there you have those there you have those here you have those down here and if you envision each one of those as stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT18|Well, from the big picture, you would still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT19|And that's the name of the game.
BULL20|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT21|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $1.55 once more.
NEUT22|I fully understand.
NEUT23|Your day trader and you bought right there, then you know you have no care.
NEUT24|You don't.
NEUT25|These stair steps do not pertain to you at all, but again, that is why I try to offer up that warning that I would be coming on things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT26|So yeah, today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today as in one day looking at multiple days as we're doing here, you can see the price does.
BULL27|They'll have plenty of opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT28|So let's see if the price can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT31|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR37|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
