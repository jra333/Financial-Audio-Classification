BEAR0|"""Tim Biggam joins us now for the Trader Rundown and you know, everybody's talking football, and so are you."
NEUT1|You say it's time to get defensive.
NEUT2|Absolutely in the Bears needed to get defensive on that last drive, but did.
NEUT3|But I think with stocks certainly here, 2019 will be the year kind of of the combination of dividends and kind of growth here.
NEUT4|Certainly 18 up until the end was big growth and the pull back, but I think given where interest rates are, I think those stocks that pay a decent yield have decent growth will be the out performers of Coca Cola.
NEUT5|Procter Gamble, the old kind of stodgy stocks in the world, so that would give your portfolio some defense, even if it's a rocky year head.
NEUT6|Absolutely.
NEUT7|That's why leaning on those dividends and also the lower beta names.
NEUT8|Certainly in the rocky market, always makes sense.
BULL9|And I think, you know, as an investor I prefer value over growth has been proven over the long haul.
BEAR10|Value outperforms growth over a long time frame.
BULL11|Thanks so much for being here better anytime.
NEUT12|Thank you.
