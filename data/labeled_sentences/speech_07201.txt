BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to the notes."
BULL1|We've had a strong day on the US stock market today.
BULL2|The S&P 500 is up more than 1% for the day, and that's despite rather poor performance on stock markets elsewhere in the world.
BEAR3|And also, despite very disappointing data from the big data point for the day, which was the monthly rash of ISMA supply Manager surveys.
NEUT4|Looking at the state of manufacturing in all cases, these are fixed so that something above 50 indicates expansion and below 50 suggests contraction.
BEAR5|Or recession now if we take a look at this chart, you can see that we have similar numbers for both the US and for China, and this is the first month since we emerged from the Great Recession in 2009 when both of these countries, both the two largest economies in the world, the US and China, have signaled a manufacturing contraction.
BEAR6|In the case of the US, you can see quite a sharp decline which can't easily be explained away.
BEAR7|It was a week reports across the board inventories.
NEUT8|New orders and so on.
BULL9|Now that has been balanced to some extent by other new data we had today on auto sales.
BULL10|And this suggests that the US consumer continues to be in fairly robust health.
BULL11|The sales of cars actually exceeding their rates from before the crisis.
BEAR12|No sign of a decline there, which people are very relieved about.
NEUT13|It still strikes me, however, that the poor manufacturing numbers should be taken very seriously.
BEAR14|There is only a very tiny drop in the perceived likelihood.
NEUT15|Of a rate rise by the Fed later this month on the back of this but plainly manufacturing numbers, that poor should give people pause for thought.
NEUT16|Now the main event for this week continues to be the ECB meeting coming up on Thursday.
BEAR17|There does appear to be a very likely divergent in monetary policy between the US and the euro zone.
NEUT18|One final point I'd like to make is that the perception that we're going to have a divergent in policy is already beginning to address.
NEUT19|The divergance in those actually economies.
NEUT20|If we take a look at this chart, it shows us the spread between predicted 10 year inflation in Germany.
NEUT21|This is all derived from the bond market compared to 10 year inflation.
BULL22|In the US you can see that about a year and a half ago Germany was predicted to have very very much lower inflation than the US.
NEUT23|It was seemed to be in a deflationary trap that.
BEAR24|Gap has narrowed very significantly over the last few months.
NEUT25|People are convinced that the Fed will start to tighten.
BULL26|They are convinced that the ECB will loosen further and that is already doing some of the central banks work for them.
NEUT27|"Now to find out whether those two central banks do indeed follow through on what everybody expects."""
