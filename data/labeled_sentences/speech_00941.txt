BULL0|"""Now, as I noted earlier on in the Program, Dark House or Shack, he has been able to get Uber back to its IPO price $45.00."
NEUT1|But you know what is Uber five years from now while they are getting closer to that adjusted EBIT da, you know, profitability?
NEUT2|They've scaled back ambitions in fright in autonomous driving, even in ride sharing, so can it still be sort of the Amazon of transportation as the company painted itself before its IPO?
NEUT3|Well dear sure you're right, it's been a few will if you don't mind.
BEAR4|It's been a long strange trip for for Uber this business.
BEAR5|The stock has gone through sort of a roller coaster.
BULL6|It's finally back up.
NEUT7|You know, quite some.
NEUT8|Later back up to its IPO price in the business is fundamentally changed.
NEUT9|The biggest thing, the most interesting thing to me is last year the bookings from their rides business or their mobility business was three times bigger than that.
NEUT10|From there each business or what's now called their delivery business this year and probably going forward, they're going to be equal in size.
NEUT11|That's the code that impact on this business.
BEAR12|They've both won and they've lossed big.
BULL13|From Kobid, but the overall asset we think continues to get stronger.
NEUT14|We like it.
BULL15|Right, but ridesharing was closer to getting profitability far closer than delivery is.
NEUT16|So how do they actually get there?
NEUT17|Do you think they get to EBIT?
NEUT18|Adjusted EBIT our profitability next year is Dara has said how did they get there?
NEUT19|That's really what I'm looking for.
BULL20|Yeah, you're right, that's a great great question and there's nothing that solves for profitability like 100% year over year revenue growth.
NEUT21|That's what they're finding into each business day announced for the first time.
BULL22|They thought that the eats business or the delivery business would reach break even next year.
NEUT23|You continue at those kind of bookings, growth rates, and they're saying they're still seeing that in the December quarter.
NEUT24|That's how you get there.
BULL25|They said you have 10 markets globally that are already at the break even or greater.
NEUT26|Revenues, not profitability.
NEUT27|In this case you have to spend a lot in this field to actually get those kinds of numbers.
NEUT28|How are the two related?
NEUT29|Yeah, well you do get there are some fixed costs in this business like in most businesses, so you scale against that and then your are seeing consolidation in this business luebbers acquired Postmates.
NEUT30|You've had other companies.
NEUT31|Grubhub acquired consolidation, maturity and industry's across the board.
NEUT32|Especially when you go public investments going to assist on profitability.
NEUT33|Insist on cutting back in those commissions.
NEUT34|That's what's happening.
NEUT35|That's what's driving the path to profitability.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
