BULL0|"""Hello and thanks for listening to this unscripted analysis by University Epublishing of Day trading."
NEUT1|Winning predictions meant for Tuesday, February 9th, 2021.
NEUT2|Alright, so this is going to be again all from the hip, so cut me some slack.
NEUT3|This is based on post market as of West Coast Time about 3:30 PM, so let's see how tomorrow goes.
NEUT4|Hoping the entire economy doesn't crash etc.
NEUT5|One big area for potential growth right now cannabis stocks again.
NEUT6|I'm going to ramble on so bear with me as I go through different cannabis stocks on my iPhone etc.
NEUT7|Alright, so first, let's start with cannabis stock ETF's.
NEUT8|So the tickers for the different ETF's that I'm aware of their doing pretty well are #1.
BULL9|There's pot X, which is my best performing ETF, at least today.
NEUT10|Next, there's MJ, which is a different ETF for cannabis stocks that did about 9% today, whereas iPod X did about 11% growth.
BULL11|Postmarket paudex is up 2% but post market on MJ.
BEAR12|It's up only .08%, so it's just probably because of the underlying cannabis stocks in the different ETF's or what have you and other one is HMLSF.
NEUT13|That's another ETF for cannabis stocks.
NEUT14|Well, if those are the three different ETF's that are worth giving a look, it's again, it's POTX is the first.
NEUT15|MJ is the 2nd and HMLSF is the third, so that's the end of the cannabis stock ETF's that I think are pretty decent.
BULL16|Let's look at individual companies, so there's Medmen Enterprises Incorporated, which today was up 47%.
NEUT17|And the ticker is MNFF and so I all I really know about these guys.
NEUT18|Is there in California to a certain extent?
NEUT19|Next is a CB which is Aurora Cannabis Incorporated which is a 16.17%.
NEUT20|Next is Emerald Health Therapeutics incorporated.
NEUT21|This is a Canadian cannabis stock I've watched for awhile.
BULL22|The ticker is MHTF and it was up 28.76% today, another one.
NEUT23|This is Penny stock.
NEUT24|I don't really know much about it.
BULL25|It's harvest one cannabis incorporated HR VOF was up 33% today.
NEUT26|Another one is Terra Tech Corp TRG.
BULL27|See 29% today.
BULL28|At Classic is Tilray incorporated up 16.99% today.
NEUT29|An post market at point 7% and then nice and old school underdog TGODF.
BULL30|The Green Organic Dutchman Holdings Limited was up 28.72% today.
NEUT31|Tgod F is at $0.37 a share.
NEUT32|Another one is if you're looking for something different, there's N Bev, which is new age incorporated, and they just do cannabis beverages.
NEUT33|Most of these guys are Canadian cannabis stocks like Tilray, Tgod, F, Aurora Emerald health therapeutics.
NEUT34|But take a take a look at these stocks and.
NEUT35|See how they do in the near future.
