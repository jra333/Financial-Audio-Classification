BULL0|"""Steve, I mean we've got 109 points being added to the Hang sang by Tencent, 40 by Alibaba, Huon on an absolute tear."
NEUT1|What's the latest?
NEUT2|Well, it removes a lot of uncertainty that is really dogged.
NEUT3|These stocks, in particular Alibaba's because of course, of all the uncertainty over the anti monopoly issues and the whereabouts of Jack Ma over recent weeks.
NEUT4|So this removes a lot of that uncertainty that was coming from the United States.
NEUT5|Now, sources are telling us who are very familiar with this matter, that the Trump administration is not going to be adding the so called bat companies.
BEAR6|Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to this investment blacklist, which would have forbid.
NEUT7|Of Americans from investing in these companies in the US or elsewhere, or holding these shares.
NEUT8|What this person?
NEUT9|This one sources telling Bloomberg News, is that Treasury refused.
NEUT10|The Treasury Department refused to go along at the urging of the Pentagon, which had its own report and list that it was pushing.
BEAR11|The Pentagon was pushing to block all companies that were deemed to have ties to the Chinese military.
NEUT12|Well Treasury, according to the source, did not go along with that.
NEUT13|And so we're hearing.
NEUT14|These three companies are not going to be added now.
NEUT15|It obviously removes a lot of uncertainty and difficulty of the prospect of unwinding all these positions that Americans have.
NEUT16|Of course, in Alibaba and these other companies because Alibaba and Tencent alone have market values through their primary listings as well.
NEUT17|Here in Hong Kong in excess well in excess of 1 trillion U.S. dollars and those two companies alone make up about 10% of the mssi emerging market benchmark.
BEAR18|Index so it would have been troublesome without a doubt.
NEUT19|Now I want to go on to say though there are many developments on this investment band, so to speak.
NEUT20|Kind of that they need to unpack the Trump administration.
NEUT21|Also today Trump himself signing an amendment to that November investment order that bans Americans from investing in certain Chinese securities.
NEUT22|This will now require for those companies that are on the list.
NEUT23|Complete divestment before the original order was prohibiting Americans from buying.
NEUT24|Now you cannot.
NEUT25|As of November 11th of this year.
NEUT26|So a year from the initial signing of the order will not be able to possess these stocks or sell them.
NEUT27|In addition to buying, so that's in addition to that also.
NEUT28|Again, I'm unpacking a lot of developments this morning.
BEAR29|We're hearing as well caught in the delisting quagmire is see Nook, the offshore drilling giant of China State owned company, S&P Dow Jones Indices says the oil giant will be ineligible for its.
NEUT30|Indices an removed prior to February 1st.
BULL31|The stock though is higher on the day.
NEUT32|And finally Hong Kong's Tracker Fund is the largest ETF here in Hong Kong.
NEUT33|It's run by State Street.
NEUT34|It is doing an about face similar to what like the New York Stock Exchange did two days ago.
NEUT35|It came out and said it was not going to buy stocks that were listed on the Trump ban.
NEUT36|Now two days later is coming back and saying we're reversing that decision and in fact this morning the manager of that.
NEUT37|Fund tracker fund.
NEUT38|State Street.
NEUT39|In a separate statement today says the ban doesn't apply because the tracker Fund and its advisors, State Street Global Advisors Asia are considered to be non US persons.
NEUT40|So while reversing its decision, the firm did reiterate though that this Hong Kong tracker fund is not suitable or appropriate for American investors.
NEUT41|"Lots to unpack."""
