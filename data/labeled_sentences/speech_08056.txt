NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|Apple continues to just grind and grind.
NEUT6|Not really any explosive movements, just slow and methodical, drifting in the upward direction.
NEUT7|And sometimes those are definitely the healthiest movements that you can see.
NEUT8|So more of the story, a lot of eyeballs going to be watching this one headed into next week.
NEUT9|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT10|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of them.
BULL11|They claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT12|That would be if the price can say above 138.
NEUT13|Now.
NEUT14|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 138.
NEUT15|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL16|But yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL17|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of power moving forward.
NEUT18|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT19|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT20|The 50.
NEUT21|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT22|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT23|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT24|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control period.
NEUT25|Most visualize that.
NEUT26|That is what is being presented against her.
NEUT27|Saying above 138 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100%.
NEUT28|Own the chart in terms of areas of resistance going to actually squeeze down the chart.
NEUT29|Here quite a bit here because it has been a long time.
NEUT30|This is an all time highs is it?
NEUT31|I don't know.
NEUT32|Let's go to daily timeframe real quick.
NEUT33|Oh, it is.
BULL34|It's breaking all time highs here.
NEUT35|Well on that note then yeah basically Blue Sky breakout.
NEUT36|At this point, I'm so you know 140, probably more so that accurate area of resistance.
NEUT37|But if the price can break above 140 then for sure at that point no dispute that would be officially Blue Sky breakout territory.
NEUT38|But hey, that's a good problem to have and you're not quite sure where resistances are because it's knocking on the door of all time highs.
BULL39|But on all the momentum continues.
NEUT40|So let's see what Apple has to offer next week.
NEUT41|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT42|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT43|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL44|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT45|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT46|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR47|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT48|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT49|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT50|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT51|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT52|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT53|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT54|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT55|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT56|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
