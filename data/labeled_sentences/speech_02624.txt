BULL0|"""You guys are quite bullish about growth next year."
BEAR1|Definitely out of consensus.
BEAR2|The markets in terms of the vaccine news that that reaction, the positive reactions waning.
NEUT3|What do you expect on the economic level?
NEUT4|Well, I think right now we have a lot of different things going on.
BEAR5|Quite a lot of bad news in terms of just the infections, especially in the US.
BEAR6|In Europe, we're seeing, you know, some some improvement in the last couple of weeks, but in the US the numbers are still getting worse.
NEUT7|I think there's a bit more uncertainty.
NEUT8|Also, around the fiscal outlook, we shaved our expectations for what we're likely to see under divided government.
BEAR9|From a $1 trillion number to a 700 billion number, obviously still a sizable amount, but quite a bit less than what we might have expected in a in in a Democratic sweep scenario.
BEAR10|So just in terms of the near charm boost to growth, it's it's going to be smaller, so I think that does mean softer numbers in the in the short term.
BEAR11|We did shave our Q4 and Q1 growth numbers.
BEAR12|We now have quite slow growth.
NEUT13|Over those two quarters.
NEUT14|But then, as you say, as you get into 2021, especially as you get into the spring.
BULL15|With the vaccine news continuing to be very positive and also with the likelihood that we're going to have a temperature kind of headwind as you get into the spring, the I think infections are going to come down because we're learning a lot about the temperature sensitivity of covert infection.
BULL16|So we think Q2Q3 very strong.
BULL17|We upgraded those were nine and a half percent quarter on quarter annualized growth in Q2.
NEUT18|Also 7% and.
BULL19|In Q3, so we still think that by Q2Q3 will be back at the pre pandemic level of real GDP and then we'll see continued good growth after no longer as rapid but.
BULL20|"But yeah, we continue to have a lot of conviction in the in the idea that this is more V shaped or vaccine shaped then I think a lot of other forecasters have in their numbers."""
