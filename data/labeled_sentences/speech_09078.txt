NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, overall a nice day.
BEAR5|It put in some higher highs and higher lows, but a little bit of a disappointing day in regards to the breaking of that level here, which had been in a level of resistance.
BEAR6|So like said, overall yeah, it was a respectable day, but you know it was a false breakout type of day.
BULL7|Meaning earlier on in the day got the gap up.
NEUT8|Price came up there broke above that red line.
NEUT9|Continue to move and move and move so it was currently, you know, breaking out at that point to use trader jargon.
NEUT10|So there was not only did it break that level, it kept on breaking out, breaking out, breaking out, and then as you see here, just all of a sudden things just turned around and back down the price one so much so that it actually dropped back below that red line.
NEUT11|Now does that mean the entire charts destroyed?
NEUT12|Absolutely not, in fact.
NEUT13|Like I said today, technically speaking, the price but in higher highs and higher lows.
BEAR14|I'm just saying that from an intraday perspective, a little bit of a disappointing day to see the price makes such a nice breakout move and then all of a sudden just totally.
NEUT15|You know, give all those games back.
NEUT16|So overall point here being is that was a fake breakout day, meaning that that red line red line here at one 1660 ISH still is going to be considered a level of resistance heading into next week and then also from the overarching standpoint, continue to watch the dotted red line up there, but as of now that's not really relevant.
NEUT17|And as I've said in past videos, you know first the price needs to prove itself by getting up above and staying up above that level keeping be there and staying above it right?
NEUT18|'cause here it got above it, but when it came to stand up above it, that's just where it completely fell apart.
NEUT19|If the price can do that, then at that point it makes more sense to you know.
NEUT20|Keep an eye on that overarching resistance.
NEUT21|Try to line up there as far as supports are concerned.
NEUT22|Nothing new here to report.
NEUT23|Still have the 1:15 mark.
BULL24|So on that note I mean I would say today was a very big success.
BULL25|I mean, the price didn't come in and we're close to even testing 115, so from that angle of things a good healthy day.
BEAR26|But overall yeah, little disappointed with the fake breakout, but nothing disastrous.
NEUT27|So we'll see what next week has to offer.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT30|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR36|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
