NEUT0|"""It's going to be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, overall a good salad, a sure the price pulled back but the pullback actually went down.
NEUT5|A very interesting area in here which I'm going to talk about.
NEUT6|But first thing to do is little house.
NEUT7|Go ahead and just get rid of that line right there.
NEUT8|Sure, that level still pertains, just not relevant right now and from her presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines every look, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible, But the first update that does even made comes about based on a foundational role in charge in which states 1 levels of resistance are broken and closed.
NEUT9|Above you want to see them act as support, so this one 2475 ish area was a former area of resistance.
NEUT10|Price got above it and then as a rule states you would like to see it act as important.
NEUT11|You know on that pull back there.
NEUT12|I mean you just can't make this stuff up.
NEUT13|You know absolutely the power of charts right there?
BEAR14|Price bounds beautifully off that level.
NEUT15|So moving forward at one 2475 Mark.
BULL16|Definitely what I would consider the ideal level of support.
NEUT17|Meaning for Ashley.
NEUT18|What make this chart look the best?
BULL19|Certainly if the price can stay above one 2475.
NEUT20|With that being said, if the price does not hold above it, that doesn't mean the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT21|As long as the price does stay above that purple line there, the 50.
NEUT22|Moving average.
NEUT23|So as the name implies, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, so as long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|Having best visualize that that is what is being represented again, staying above one 2475 would be great, but as long as the price is above that purple line, that's what matters most.
NEUT25|And then as far as areas of resistance still do have that level right there around 1:26 ish.
NEUT26|But now that we have more data, I'm just going to go ahead and adjust this area of resistance right up there to 127 an whenever levels of resistance need to be adjusted in the upward direction.
NEUT27|That's always a good sign, so that doesn't mean that the price is going to continue to explode upwards, but it's always a good thing.
NEUT28|If resistance levels need to be adjusted higher, which was the case here.
NEUT29|So overall the trend continues.
NEUT30|It'll be interesting to see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL34|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT40|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live.
