NEUT0|"""Hey guys, this is a very quick 62nd update on a whistleblower in the SEC."
NEUT1|We see right here too long.
NEUT2|Didn't read.
NEUT3|Of course we only have 60 seconds that a whistleblower came to the SEC within 120 days.
NEUT4|That's under the Safe Harbor provision of the SEC's guidelines, and now they're going to treat this information criminal into information, raising internal concerns, and this may very much likely be related to the closed door SEC meeting that happened.
NEUT5|Earlier on a couple of days ago and that's one of the most important questions at the SEC is having closed door meetings about pulling up criminal legal documents and then having this whistleblower come out with actual information of what they are criminally prosecuting now, we're likely seeing the end game arrive right as we can see it, if you guys have not yet gone out the description.
NEUT6|Down below is a good chance that you guys have not gotten your $250 or free Bitcoin.
NEUT7|If you do press that link.
NEUT8|"Go ahead and deposit up to however much you want, but you get $250 of free Bitcoin and you can get 8.6% APY, which is how I keep a savings account because which savings account is going to be able to give you that much money for now, but after forever I'll see you after you like and subscribe to get this video out to more space apes and Moon Platoon members and we'll see you in the money."""
