NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|Well, I'm in the state the obvious here, but I will anyways just to establish some context, but overall very impressive movement when you think about the fact that just on.
BULL3|Tuesday the price was down here and now Amazon has worked its way up to their.
NEUT4|Yeah, there's still work that needs to be done, but pointer being from where the price that was at its lows to where it is right now.
BULL5|Nice solid move.
NEUT6|So that does.
NEUT7|Bring about the question.
NEUT8|Yeah, nice move, but is there any sort of power?
NEUT9|Is there any sort of genuine strength behind this movement?
NEUT10|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead Cat Bounce Site moved and I have no idea.
NEUT12|But by using charge we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it's all about this area here at the 3075 Mark.
NEUT13|Now I'm not saying this was going to actually happen, but for explanation sake, let's say the price comes down here behaves in that manner, then breaks to the downside.
NEUT14|What would you have at that point?
NEUT15|Well, from a very literal POV you would quite literally have the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out from it.
NEUT16|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were.
NEUT17|Not exactly sound true power, true strength or anything like that, but to be fair, no.
NEUT18|Pricing goes straight up, so maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner.
NEUT19|Then search works way back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden what would you have while you have a set of Lowe's?
NEUT21|Right there you have a set of those right there.
NEUT22|If you envision each one of those stair steps, well, hey there you go.
NEUT23|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And that's named the game.
NEUT25|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL26|Overtime it's going to make progress forward and again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 3075 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|Main level, which is going to be that pink line up there.
NEUT28|It's on my chart.
NEUT29|Denotes the 200.
NEUT30|Moving average and the current value of that is right up there around 3170.
NEUT31|So keep it on that level moving forward.
NEUT32|But All in all, any angle you look at it.
NEUT33|Very nice.
NEUT34|Bounce today.
NEUT35|Nice movement.
NEUT36|Not just a question of can the price build up on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT37|Let's see what happens.
NEUT38|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT39|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT40|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT41|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL42|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT43|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT44|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR45|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT46|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT47|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT48|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT49|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
