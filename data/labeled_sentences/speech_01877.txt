NEUT1|Video chart on ticker symbol CTRM.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|While a rough day on this one, as the past couple of days talked about where you gotta give credit where credit is due, at least the price was able to go sideways.
NEUT6|So maybe this is some sort of bottom.
NEUT7|And of course bottom being defined as at least staying above that green line.
BEAR8|Well today that whole theory has been thrown out the window because the price is now broken down below that area of support and therefore put in new lows.
NEUT9|So to think that that is the bottom were clearly proven that wrong, it was just a little break that the Bears took before resuming their push downward.
NEUT10|Sarah so certainly updates need to be done first.
NEUT11|Do little house cleaning, get rid of that line that served its purpose for now, but the first big update an important one comes about based on a foundational role in charting.
NEUT12|Which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance, so going into the day $0.56 was that key level of support, but now that the price is broken down below there, that becomes Public Enemy number one in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT13|So if the price does try to consolidate out and then it works way back upwards, no $0.56 is now the big question mark, not necessarily in the price.
NEUT14|Get back up to 56 but much more importantly, can the price actually break above it and stay up above it?
NEUT15|So you're going to keep a close eye on that level moving forward.
NEUT16|Like I said, if there is any sort of attempted bounce as far as levels of support or concern.
NEUT17|I just squeeze things out here so you can get an idea.
NEUT18|Of the fact that it's been a long, long time since the price went down this low, but next key level of support now moving forward going to be right down there.
NEUT19|And let's see what is that the $0.50 mark which I believe is right where it's bouncing from 'cause it was the low from way back here.
NEUT20|One was that out of curiosity while back in late January.
NEUT21|So we'll zoom back in here.
NEUT22|But yeah, there we go.
NEUT23|That's right.
NEUT24|Where the price did balance.
BULL25|So at least the price did maintain about $0.50.
BULL26|But that will definitely be the level of support here headed forward.
NEUT27|So 56 cents.
NEUT28|Key level of resistance.
BULL29|$0.50 key level of support.
NEUT30|Let's see how this one plays out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT33|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR37|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT43|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT44|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT45|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT46|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
