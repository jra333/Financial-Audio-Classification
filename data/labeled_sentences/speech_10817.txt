NEUT0|"""Tomorrow's with Bitcoin."
NEUT1|You will see right the same way.
NEUT2|Any fluctuations there.
NEUT3|Even though the price of Bitcoin may have not changed dramatically your day over day percentage wise Mara Riots Square will all move accordingly.
NEUT4|So just be ready for those for those jolts when they happen.
BEAR5|And of course with most of tech down.
BEAR6|That's just another reason for more to be down as well.
NEUT7|Technically speaking, you know this was pretty much the support and resistance point.
NEUT8|It is not below it.
BULL9|The mighty sword over 0, so we're still OK right now with Mara.
NEUT10|If you're in that position, but remember the RSI's about to go below 50 once it gets below 50 you can see the next support level right over here at 32 bucks.
NEUT11|So right now, if you're not in a position to not interrupt position if you're into a position here, just be ready for that down.
NEUT12|"Turn back to the 50 before any bounce higher."""
