NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take a look at the Apple stock now."
NEUT1|It's about several minutes to the market closing.
NEUT2|We can see here during the day I post.
NEUT3|Doc has a make high during the new and then dropped a little bit and then have a support here and bounce back again.
NEUT4|If we check it in detail again see the volume here.
NEUT5|This volume is very high but this volume.
NEUT6|It's just a break out from the.
NEUT7|Average.
NEUT8|Moving average line.
NEUT9|So actually it means when it has by power to buy power is strong and when it has selling power we can see here on the same part.
BEAR10|Selling power is declining so it's a bullish sign for echo.
NEUT11|If we check here, we can see when the Apple dropped.
NEUT12|Around the 3:00 PM you can see here the big volume, right?
NEUT13|Hearts to a has had just with go with this.
NEUT14|Condo with a lower tail.
BULL15|That means this big volume just supporting of the firepower, so this still a bullish sign.
NEUT16|So in my opinion.
BULL17|Short term Apple stock has gained momentum and has some positive side.
NEUT18|If we change the chart into daily chart.
NEUT19|Then we can see here after one 2-3 after three days drop.
BULL20|Now there's finally a bounce back.
NEUT21|And also we can see here it has a five days.
NEUT22|You may and 20 days you may all together on the same line nearly so now we faced the direction for the stock.
NEUT23|So in my opinion regarding to this volume and this.
BULL24|Green Candle the Apple stock can make a further consolidation around the five year may and 20 year may until the volume goes up again.
BEAR25|So this volume is not enough to push it to any direction.
NEUT26|So it's no further down and no further up, so we need another high volume to take it to.
NEUT27|One of the direction up or down, and if we change the chart into daily chart.
NEUT28|You can see here actually after the.
NEUT29|Cup is here and now we face the Cup handle.
NEUT30|In this handled.
NEUT31|There is very small.
BULL32|Transaction volume, so actually this is a good sign.
NEUT33|When it's a red candle, it means there's.
NEUT34|Small setting pressure.
BULL35|Small selling pressure for the stock so it's a good sign it's a bullish sign.
BULL36|So in my opinion, in midterm, Apple stock still has the possibility to go higher from here.
BULL37|"Thank you very much."""
