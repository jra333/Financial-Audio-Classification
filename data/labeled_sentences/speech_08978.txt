NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Clay in this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|While a very very impressive day here on Apple, I mean a stop.
NEUT4|And when you think about the fact that not that long ago the price was just sitting all the way down here and now it's worked its way all the way up to that area.
NEUT5|Not bad, not bad at all, but let's get some levels of support and resistance now mapped out moving forward so that we can, you know, keep an eye on things from more so the technical point of view.
NEUT6|So the first area of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly one.
NEUT7|Make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT8|Could say up here above 118 fifty.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong.
NEUT10|If one 1850 fails.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL12|The price could manage stay above that level.
BULL13|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Now the next level, which I'm still not going to call a do or die level, but I would definitely consider it more important.
NEUT15|Sits down here at one 1725 and the reason why that love was important.
NEUT16|I'm not saying again that this was going to happen, but if the price were to come down there and then breakdown through that area where all of a sudden you'd have the price right back to where it was or said another way, that would imply that the price has made a very nice move up and all of a sudden is right back to where it began began.
BEAR17|Now does that destroy the entire chart?
NEUT18|No, it doesn't destroy the entire chart, but.
NEUT19|As far as this nice bounce that's currently underway, yeah it does pretty much wipe away all of that, so those are going to be the two main levels of support to watch.
NEUT20|Now what about areas of resistance?
BULL21|First year of resistance in the near term.
NEUT22|Going to be right here at the one 1960 ish area and then if the price can break above there, that's where things get pretty interesting.
NEUT23|'cause next level now?
NEUT24|Not until up around the one 2150 Mark.
NEUT25|Now I'm not saying that that level is broken.
NEUT26|Then you know within two seconds it's going up there, but it does enter into, you know, kind of this little void here on the chart, which suggests that it could pick up some additional momentum there, but overall those would be the main technical levels to watch moving forward, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT27|Going into Thursday.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT29|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT34|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT40|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT41|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT42|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT43|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
