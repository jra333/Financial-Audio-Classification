BULL0|"""After brutal hammering last week, this market is back in Rally mode, setting into a solid rhythm were good news gets rewarded with higher prices like the Dow game 332 points today."
BULL1|As to becoming 1.9% NASDAQ jumping 1.23%, why not?
NEUT2|That's what we want, isn't it straightforward moves based on how companies are actually doing not chaotic moves caused by short squeezes in rocket ship, emo, geez?
NEUT3|The anger and frustration shelf would be isn't this a good moment to take stock?
NEUT4|So at the big game coming up on Sunday, let's take inspiration from the NFL Championship and set our lineups the same way.
NEUT5|The Chiefs and Buccaneers are setting up.
NEUT6|There's I cannot believe how much time I spend on this today.
NEUT7|I mean, I'm supposed to be recuperating the hell with that stocks and sports go hand in hand.
NEUT8|The disciplines ducktail almost perfectly in the analogies are great way to make the market more accessible to you.
NEUT9|To all of us.
NEUT10|It's fine, this is what I used to do.
NEUT11|I had people do stock market fancy dress where they had to explain to me why they like something in a few short senses and why it belonged in our portfolio.
NEUT12|I can't trade anymore, but boy I can talk about stocks.
NEUT13|So with that in mind, who are the Dream team players?
NEUT14|We want to put on the field for Sundays game and what are their stock market equivalents?
NEUT15|I'm going to stop for a second.
NEUT16|I want you to write this down because I spent so much time in this darn thing.
NEUT17|You gotta remember these players.
NEUT18|First we need a quarterback.
NEUT19|Patrick Mahomes might be the most electric player in the League, but you know why I gotta have the goat greatest of all time and that's Tom Brady.
NEUT20|If he's old enough to be bones.
NEUT21|Father, if Tom Brady Warstock well you know what?
NEUT22|He Apple, I always say, own Apple.
NEUT23|Don't trade it.
NEUT24|I bet the Patriots which they listened to, the fans who said the same thing about Brady before they let him become a free agent.
NEUT25|Applewhite Brady is the most consistent player in the game.
BULL26|Frankly, this is really an easy call, especially now that Apple is getting into the car business.
NEUT27|I mean, like I said, I got an Apple phone.
NEUT28|I got Apple TV, Apple credit card or two.
