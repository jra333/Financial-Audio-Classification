BULL0|"""I think importantly, this is perceived."
NEUT1|I'll tell you on the Wall Street community as political pushback.
BEAR2|I think when you look at some of the data out there, there definitely is increased concern about it.
BEAR3|But some of the data shows it's not necessarily any worse than any of the other vaccines.
BULL4|And I would argue there's a little bit of political pushback on that.
NEUT5|So it could be a little bit more politics and actual science, and I would say most people have brushed this off to be nothing more than that, and we've got plenty of vaccines, and we've been talking about this for Moderna and Pfizer coming through the pipeline.
NEUT6|Of all of the companies that are out with vaccines, Michael, which one do you favor in terms of what it could mean for longer term profitability?
NEUT7|Well, that's an easy one for us.
NEUT8|I think in terms of who's going to be in the lead over the next couple of years.
NEUT9|It's clearly Moderna, Pfizer Biontech and to a lesser extent Nova Vax.
BULL10|Pfizer and Moderna have clearly demonstrated the ability to not only manufacturing get it out there with a safe and effective vaccine, but even as of today Moderna announcing the start of their multiple variant.
NEUT11|Vaccines are they're way ahead of everybody else.
NEUT12|So if we do need endemic vaccines, if we do need a booster shot every year, which most people are saying we do, clearly those players are going to be in the lead were most favorable in those guys.
NEUT13|Michael given their all these options, is there a risk in the US that we start to see a little glimpse of what seemingly is happening?
NEUT14|The EU, particularly as it relates to the Astra Zeneca vaccine, where there's perhaps some negativity towards it, but where people pause and say no.
NEUT15|I want to wait.
NEUT16|I want to get my vaccine of choice.
NEUT17|I guess he would be more about.
NEUT18|The one that most positive on, as opposed to being negative on them but but is there a risk that slows down the roll out here?
NEUT19|Well, I actually would argue that what we're seeing and what I predict is that you're going to see a huge wave of supply from Pfizer Moderna to a lesser extent janjay, which I'm sure you know you could talk about two and that there is going to be huge demand for that over the next few minutes.
NEUT20|Whether there's questions about.
NEUT21|Oh, some side effects here.
NEUT22|There we heard about this.
NEUT23|I expect that to happen, but the end of the day the risk benefit of the vaccine, the high efficacy, and the fact that people want to get this and get out there is absolutely on track.
NEUT24|And that's where we're seeing.
NEUT25|Michael quickly.
BULL26|Why did Lillie go down despite what I thought, looked to be somewhat promising results from the Alzheimer's treatment and we desperately need this.
NEUT27|Yeah, I'll, I'll make two comments on that one.
BULL28|Is Lily's had a fantastic run year to date on the initial top line.
NEUT29|Results with the Alzheimer's drug data came out.
BULL30|Looks very good.
BEAR31|There was a sell off lilies, clearly suggesting they're probably gonna have to run a second study.
NEUT32|As you know, some people thought and there's some profit taking on that.
NEUT33|We gotta wait for that next study.
NEUT34|Interestingly, Biogen of course, as you know, with an FDA decision on their Alzheimer's drug.
NEUT35|The FDA right now decisions by June.
BEAR36|There's a lot of nervousness about it could pull up the intraday chart.
BEAR37|Biogen was down as much as five 6%.
NEUT38|We hosted a doc call today, nervousness about whether the F. Yeah, a reviewer, Billy John is still working on that reveal, but there's a lot of nervousness that we'll find out by June 7th.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
