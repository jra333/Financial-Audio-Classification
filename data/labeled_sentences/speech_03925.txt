BEAR0|"""It's very tough at any given time too."
NEUT1|To look forward and and know what level of valuation is is justified.
NEUT2|You do know one certain dangerous things appear, and certainly if you're predicating.
BULL3|You're after that stocks are OK at these prices.
NEUT4|My name is Sammy Wong from Irvine, CA.
NEUT5|I have two questions.
BEAR6|Question number one he used in the USA market is overvalued today.
NEUT7|Question #2 would you buy proschan housewares stock today, considering the fact that it be, they have a nice one.
NEUT8|I've already this year.
NEUT9|And if yes, presuming advocate 20 years old and his $150,000 to invest in Persia, his way, and he wanted money until five years later, gradually would you recommend to buy Asia?
NEUT10|Or be sure all the combination?
NEUT11|Thank you.
NEUT12|If you decide to buy Berkshire, I don't think it really makes much difference with you by A or B.
NEUT13|What?
NEUT14|We don't make any recommendations about whether people.
NEUT15|Why or?
NEUT16|For Sale Berkshire we never have an.
NEUT17|That's a game we don't want to get into terms of overvalue over the question where the market is overvalued.
NEUT18|Generally it's simply as we said last year here in the annual report.
NEUT19|It's not the general market is not overvalued.
NEUT20|If two conditions are met which is in our view, which is that?
NEUT21|Interest rates remain at or near present levels or go lower and or and that corporate profitability in the US stay at the present.
NEUT22|Proposed to the president.
NEUT23|Bubbles which are.
NEUT24|Virtually unprecedented, now those are a couple of big ifs.
NEUT25|As we've pointed out.
NEUT26|A lot of the stories that came out after the report would emphasize one aspect or another, but it's simply and they say what does he mean by that?
NEUT27|Well, it means exactly what I say is true.
NEUT28|If the two conditions are met, I think it's not overvalued, and if the if either of the conditions is breached in an important way, I think it will turn out to be overvalued.
NEUT29|And I don't know the answer, which is why I put it with in the form that I did.
NEUT30|It's very tough at any given time too.
NEUT31|To look forward and and know what level of valuation is is justified.
NEUT32|You do know one certain dangerous things appear, and certainly if you're predicating.
BULL33|Your answer that stocks are OK at these prices.
NEUT34|You have it.
NEUT35|If you come to that conclusion, you have to also come to the conclusion that.
BULL36|In our view, that corporate earnings at present levels are likely to be maintained and, and that's a conclusion you would have to come to.
NEUT37|"I don't think it's obvious that that's the case."""
