NEUT0|"""Hey guys it's Nolan with another episode of Jyoti are Google Trends investing from the dumb Money Discord Group I have the mic right up here."
BULL1|So hopefully the audio is good.
BULL2|I'm taking three strikes already on the audio so hopefully this works out a little better.
NEUT3|I'm going to try to talk more directly into this, but the stock is one that was covered yesterday so I entered entry level position for me.
NEUT4|It took one started yesterday.
NEUT5|It's a small 1 1/2% position for me right now, so not a huge amount of conviction but one that.
NEUT6|I'm very eager to see the earnings report and that's coming up in a couple weeks for them again.
NEUT7|I got more digging to do some.
NEUT8|You're going to be best served, probably by going to read the high conviction post.
NEUT9|I think I think was eat those things, Ryan wrote.
BULL10|The high conviction post there.
NEUT11|If it's not Albany, apologize, but there's a high conviction post that I read through thumb through it.
NEUT12|It's really strong, so check the discord out this dedicated channel for Collectors universe, but again, they are actually the leader in this space.
NEUT13|The Google Trends clearly show that they are currently limited by how much they can actually, how quickly they can grade and turn them around.
NEUT14|There's.
NEUT15|Currently quite a delay in getting them to getting back to you, so they're hiring, so there I guess, so creating other facilities where I gather from this call as well, I'll be keeping an eye on Glassdoor to better gauge how they're growing.
BEAR16|It's pretty small amount of jobs out there.
NEUT17|I haven't LinkedIn yet either, but.
NEUT18|Again, Collectors Universe card authentication.
NEUT19|Their name doesn't get searched all that much.
NEUT20|Is the PSA grading one of the properties they own?
NEUT21|Is the main part to be following here, so this is simply just me reposting essentially what was that that album took them through in the live stream there, but we see even it's small, but it's really pronounced the Pokémon Reddit card, so I think we're going to see the communities take off a little bit, so I want to see that the Reddit following increases for a number of these areas.
NEUT22|I've got more digging to there.
NEUT23|I'll try to weigh into the dedicated channel myself.
NEUT24|I'm also gauging the Google trends around PSA rankings and something to remove the Pokémon cards so we can actually take a look at the PSA numbers.
NEUT25|I mean it's not really and I probably put quotes around them, so if you could quote it can make sure those two words are one or the other.
NEUT26|But here you can see PSA 10 PSA 9 on the climb, so again it's an exciting position to small one minute.
NEUT27|I'll be being a part of the community there, so again as I get in these early stages so I thought it was this mean not with high conviction.
NEUT28|There are three I had over 10 or 15% positions for for Square and Peleton, and Roku wasn't too far behind that.
NEUT29|But this is not a super high conviction for me.
NEUT30|But I'm showing you how I go through this process where it's called keywords everywhere.
NEUT31|Is this plugin.
NEUT32|You can add it on Chrome and they'll give you related words.
NEUT33|If there's enough volume for it, they actually give you the Google trends for it as well.
NEUT34|I'm kind of surprised I typed it wrong, but usually the Google Trends chart will show live right there, but going through some of these ones that might be interesting combinations of words to do that there's enough volume to gain.
NEUT35|Some kind of understanding, but this PSA 9 PSA 10 people are caring about what the grading of the card is, so the demand things out there for these cards, and I'm hoping that I could see that continue and as long as I'm seeing the trend to be my friend, I'm going to stay in the position so I lend lend it there really short video of a cop out then I'm really just using all the information from the team on order the Discord Community there.
NEUT36|So again, check him out.
BULL37|There's a high conviction post.
BULL38|I'm sorry I remember Salvador or Ryan posted, but it's a really good, well done.
BULL39|Post on that front so awesome job on the live stream guys.
NEUT40|I have to catch up with some of these posts.
NEUT41|It's obviously a really active channel these days, but it's interesting 11 and hopefully it will make some money on but let me know if any questions below.
BULL42|I appreciate it.
NEUT43|Like a subscribe if the audio is clear.
NEUT44|Anyways, if it's not let me know again.
NEUT45|I'm going to check the audio before I've gotta run to actually a subdued wedding so I gotta get going.
NEUT46|"But but yeah, let the trend be your friend and have a great weekend guys bye."""
