BULL0|"""Hey everybody, signal here with the bullish bears as requested."
NEUT1|I'm doing a deep dive into Disney.
NEUT2|And you can see that if you just want to cut to the chase, Disney is a strong investment.
NEUT3|If you're going to take a long term position but with no dividend.
NEUT4|With the theme parks closed and the box office is closed, only large portfolio traders should be looking to build a position here.
BULL5|But look guys, Disney is a powerhouse.
BULL6|They've had a good transition from CEO's.
BEAR7|They're continuing to grow their hammering down on their studio purchases.
NEUT8|They've got Lucasfilm, Disney animation, Disney live action.
NEUT9|Pixar Marvel.
NEUT10|20th Century Fox.
BULL11|All of these things make it a great company.
NEUT12|After the virus, the theme parks are going to come right back into play.
BULL13|They're going to be doing just fine when it comes to theaters, and they're working on a pay-per-view, which they just try it out.
NEUT14|Literally.
NEUT15|This month in September of 2020, so if that continues to do well.
NEUT16|I don't see why this could not be a great company to add to the portfolio, but again, you're going to want to be a big position trader, or at least someone with a large portfolio 'cause you're going to need to hang on to this for a while.
NEUT17|It's gonna have some pops.
BEAR18|It's gonna get a little volatile.
NEUT19|With the.
NEUT20|Films that are coming out, they keep winning awards.
BULL21|They're gonna have some volatility in the stock, but this market isn't going to double just because of some good movies.
NEUT22|There's no other way to say that.
NEUT23|If they can't continue to produce.
NEUT24|Theme parks based on the theaters, the movies that they make in the animations that they have.
NEUT25|If they can't continue to do that kind of stuff.
NEUT26|If they can't increase their streaming.
BEAR27|If they can't do something with this paper view in a way that can make up for the losses in the theaters, there is no way this market is going to double in price.
NEUT28|I don't think they're going to leave their dividend off forever, but there is no dividend.
NEUT29|There is no stock buybacks.
NEUT30|There is nothing that's going to make this thing really rocket out until we get that virus out of the way and they get back to opening up again.
NEUT31|So that's my take on this.
NEUT32|I did not move the screen through the entire discussion, so you can take a screenshot and you can crawl through the information that I have posted here.
NEUT33|I'm not going to dig through all of it, 'cause to sum it all up.
NEUT34|It's not going anywhere till we get done with this virus and we get a vaccine.
NEUT35|"Thanks everybody, I'll see you at the next video."""
