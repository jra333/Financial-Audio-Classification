NEUT0|"""It's very easy to build a brand that's relevant for two or three years, but to really build a brand that lasts, it really starts and ends with listening to your community and building something that they love."
NEUT1|My name is Kenny Tellez and I'm the CEO and founder of Parade.
NEUT2|I grew up going to the mall and seeing and now add 2 cups bra and you know these massive supermodels blown up on the side of the building.
NEUT3|They were over sexualizing women and I knew that that narrative had come to an end and there was time for a new brand to come along and rewrite the American underwear story.
BULL4|The past two years starting parade, we've grown and we're now one of the fastest growing do to see businesses in the world.
NEUT5|I think to me, American dream is about imagination and the possibility of recasting yourself.
NEUT6|And, you know the world around you.
BULL7|The world is at a critical place where the need for young imaginative leaders is so much greater.
NEUT8|And I think that with that comes the expectation and the need for vision.
NEUT9|Very few startups succeed, most of them fail, and in that you know we have a responsibility to swing for the fences and think beyond just you know, one market.
NEUT10|1 customer.
NEUT11|Think about how we can.
NEUT12|"Really rewrite and redefine our entire industries."""
