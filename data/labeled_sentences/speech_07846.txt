NEUT0|"""What's the second leg of the two year yield done?"
NEUT1|It's what all your clients are going to want to know from this morning down we go in September, I showed the chart early.
NEUT2|I don't have it right now.
NEUT3|Riley, down.
NEUT4|We go in September.
BULL5|Now we roll that we go up yet all clear beloning down we go again 1.47%.
NEUT6|What's its signal?
NEUT7|That we're doomed now.
NEUT8|I think I was just looking at it on my way here on my phone.
NEUT9|Bloomberg app, that.
NEUT10|That fed funds futures are more or less discounting a rate cut on October 30.
NEUT11|Now that would be three in a row, now of about 80%, and it's bouncing around a lot 'cause the Fed funds rate in the market daily effective rate is bouncing around.
NEUT12|But yeah, we're pretty much prime for a third rate cut, just like Chicago fed Evans wanted.
NEUT13|He wanted three rate cuts or he looked back to the 90s and said those three rate cuts were good for risk management purposes.
NEUT14|But Chris, is this an insurance cut, right?
NEUT15|Like we've heard, I mean, how many insurance constant?
NEUT16|Yeah, they keep saying insurance.
NEUT17|Well, they they now have regarded right, especially 'cause is it insurance cut or is it because actually the data is turning quite quickly so it's it's just needed?
NEUT18|I think it's still insurance.
BEAR19|I mean the purchasing managers for manufacturing ISMA they see recession coming all the time.
BEAR20|It seems like where you know the index level goes down below the 50 and signals that manufacturing is contract contracting so they kind of they're hypersensitive.
NEUT21|I would say these purchasing managers they don't always get it right.
NEUT22|You know manufacturing jobs are.
BEAR23|8 1/2 percent of payroll jobs in the entire country.
BEAR24|Is that enough to bring down the broader economy?
NEUT25|Don't forget, I **.
NEUT26|It's what 47.8 now manufacturing index.
BEAR27|It has to come down to 42.9.
BEAR28|It's going to fall five more points to signal an actual recession.
NEUT29|If I was a fed, I would wait for, you know, the recession signs to appear.
BEAR30|I think they're moving too early.
NEUT31|OK, are they moving too early because of my charts and let's me bring you over to the spread between the two and 10 year Treasury that the markets are just expecting too much.
BULL32|So they're trying to keep up with market expectation.
BEAR33|Yeah, they are kind of being pulled along, and in fact a lot of people think that the Fed cannot deliver what the market wants.
NEUT34|That's why I was surprised after I ** fell that you know the Fed funds futures now are saying a rate cut in October as opposed to December.
NEUT35|So that would be 3 meetings in a row.
NEUT36|But more than three.
NEUT37|I don't think they're going to need to do more than three without a recession, but what is the impact of this?
NEUT38|Let's cut to the chase.
NEUT39|3 is fine and if Evans goes back to the 90s or whatever.
NEUT40|That was not near the zero bound.
NEUT41|What is the efficacy?
NEUT42|This is a Michael McKee question.
NEUT43|What are what is the efficacy of these rate cuts in the vicinity of the zero bound?
NEUT44|Yeah, I'm I. I don't really like to forecast another Fed rate cut because I think they're going to do what happened to Europe and Japan with Rachel going negative rates or zero rates.
NEUT45|Once you get to the rim puting the thrust towards a Japan or Europe, it seems like it.
NEUT46|I mean they seem to believe they there's more they can do right?
NEUT47|And they even say that once they hit zero fed officials that there's more that they can do like they can give forward guidance.
NEUT48|I mean what's that?
NEUT49|Where they're going to promise to keep rates low for eight years?
BEAR50|I mean, they're going to put me out of a job here watching fix, don't want that because you know we don't work mobile app.
NEUT51|"That's the only reason."""
