NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, its David Keno with base camp trading and this is the free video for Friday May 24th."
NEUT1|I'm looking today at Xle which is the S&P Select Energy.
NEUT2|Fighters, so this is the energy sector of the S&P 500 and you can see that we've just come out of this consolidation pattern that we've been in most of the month.
BEAR3|We are now starting to break lower yesterday and today I would look for this to continue lower to the $60.00 level.
NEUT4|As the first target, the second target would be roughly 58 and the target below that will be.
BEAR5|Just below 54 and that is the low of December 26, 2018.
NEUT6|Now.
NEUT7|Energy prices are definitely tide to crude oil, so we gotta keep one eye on that.
BEAR8|But what we definitely have is a potential downside.
NEUT9|Move in Excele over the next couple of weeks.
NEUT10|Keep an eye on energy prices.
BULL11|"Keep an eye on crude oil prices and watch for momentum to continue to carry a slower."""
