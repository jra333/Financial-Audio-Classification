NEUT0|"""Jay, I want to speak directly about this this great out bed you have today focusing on the importance of financial education for the next generation and just what we as a country need to do."
NEUT1|Because it's not, you know, this disclosure is part of it, but also being able to understand the disclosures is very meaningful.
NEUT2|Well, well, look at Andrew it is.
NEUT3|It is so important for people to understand early that financial decision making is going to be part of your life.
NEUT4|Usually it comes in the form of credit rather than investing out of the box, whether it's student loans, car loans, and the like.
NEUT5|Understanding that those decisions are going to be part of your life and to make better decisions to look at fees, costs and expenses to minimize those and then turning to to investing.
NEUT6|Look, I think we've seen a lot and you know, I like Jim Cramer's comments on this.
BULL7|With the volatility that we've seen with the meme stocks and archives, I hope that the increase in investing that we've seen.
NEUT8|People don't pull back as a result of this volatility and the losses that it causes because people need to invest for the long term.
NEUT9|We've decided that.
NEUT10|You have individual responsibility for your entire Minton in America and I just encourage people to learn early.
NEUT11|Get started early.
NEUT12|Andrew when we did town halls when I was chairman of the SEC.
NEUT13|The one thing that everybody said to me was I wish I knew more earlier than I wish.
NEUT14|I got started more earlier.
NEUT15|I got started investing earlier.
NEUT16|So how are we going to do that?
BULL17|But I think he would do well.
NEUT18|My iPad says hey grandparents, you pick up so many of the pieces you do so many things.
NEUT19|I was lucky enough that my grandparents took the time to teach me about savings credit and eventually the basics of investing.
NEUT20|Not the complicated Stein, but invest for the long term.
NEUT21|Watch taxes, watch fees, have a balanced portfolio.
NEUT22|Think about diversification.
NEUT23|So that's one thing.
NEUT24|Start at home.
NEUT25|You don't want children to be afraid of credit and.
NEUT26|We should have it in the schools book.
NEUT27|Investing.
NEUT28|Understanding your connection to the financial community is such an important part of American life and in my own ideas.
NEUT29|Hey, let's give every kid a bank account.
NEUT30|Get him started.
