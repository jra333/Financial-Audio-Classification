NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Will a very very impressive day on this one.
NEUT5|So more of the story a lot of updates need to be made here and you know it's looking like a lot of eyeballs will be watching this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So first thing to do here is a little bit of house cleaning here and actually just get rid of both of these lines.
NEUT7|Sure these levels still pertain to the chart, there, just not necessarily relevant right now from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines are very long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible.
NEUT8|But when the newest areas of support what I would call the ideal area cycling one, make this chart now look the absolute strongest going forward.
NEUT9|That would be if the price can say above 123.
NEUT10|Now.
NEUT11|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 123.
BULL12|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and looking at things from the bigger picture POV battles with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT15|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT16|Which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there, being defined as the move, just watch a purple line.
NEUT17|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|His visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yeah, stand above 123 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT21|Gotta squeeze things down here a little bit as the price continues to grind higher and higher so the next key overarching levels keep a close eye on, at least in my opinion.
NEUT22|Can be right there at the one 2485 Mark and then after one 2485 next key level.
NEUT23|Can we write up there around 12625 so keep running those couple of areas moving forward but no doubt about it the bonds continues and not just a question of Canada.
BULL24|Price continue to build those higher bases.
NEUT25|Let's see how the week plays out First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT26|I want to invite you to a live webinar web class training workshop online event.
NEUT27|Whatever you want to call it but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL29|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT35|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT37|That is again totally live.
