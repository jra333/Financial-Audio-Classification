BULL0|"""JPM cutting beyond meat to neutral."
NEUT1|They go.
NEUT2|They shave their target.
BULL3|4 bucks to 134 still supportive of the overall business story.
NEUT4|Jim, you know look, I thought that that may not go down.
NEUT5|I mean, that was by the way we liked it at 75 and went to 122.
NEUT6|Ever like that?
NEUT7|I like that kind of cool.
NEUT8|I think that's a good one, but beyond meat is become something that millennials.
NEUT9|This is the the millennial stock and you had the Denny's news?
NEUT10|You McDonald's?
BEAR11|Obviously they're going to have trouble making demand.
NEUT12|It's just it's fabulous.
NEUT13|7.5 billion I think it's fabulous.
NEUT14|I'm still with you are yeah I am.
BULL15|I think beyond means great story.
NEUT16|The trend is it's friend.
NEUT17|Well, I mean like people people don't like to slaughter animals.
NEUT18|They don't like the way that they pop the chicken so they don't really think it's.
NEUT19|Unnatural.
NEUT20|No, I know I've talked about the poor chickens that can't even walk.
NEUT21|If you kill a cow that's two years old, can you off that found me for heat that count rest of the year.
NEUT22|Speaking Speaking of food, McDonald's is going to report this week and some news about some additions to the menu with breakfast chicken mcgriddle.
NEUT23|Yeah, that's hard to find.
BULL24|That might be good.
NEUT25|The new mcchicken breakfast as well.
NEUT26|So now it's been a horse of late, will see if they can drive any traffic.
BULL27|Take back a little share from some of its smaller scrappy arrivals.
NEUT28|Yeah, I mean, Wendy's is obviously coming hard with the breakfast when you go to a, I find Wendy's kind of picking up here.
NEUT29|When you go to a Popeyes, not Popeyes like I'm from Philly they say listen we have not many of these mocks, you know like these kind of signs put up say we don't have chicken we don't have it.
NEUT30|That's usually that's a sign of demand.
NEUT31|Isn't it?
NEUT32|McDonald's would not do anything unless they could meet.
NEUT33|That's exactly right.
NEUT34|That's exactly why you're not going to find shortages in McDonald's.
NEUT35|"And given their size that that is one of the challenges."""
