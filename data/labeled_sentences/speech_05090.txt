BULL0|"""Hi guys and welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|Netflix has been outperforming the market and just set record highs but I'm not buying into the hype and today I'm going to give you my 10 reasons why I think you should hold off on buying Netflix and just for the record, I'm not a financial advisor and this short video is for entertainment purposes.
NEUT2|Number one.
BULL3|Netflix is overvalued.
BEAR4|If you cut my recent video on the top tech stocks, you'll know that I'm not big on Netflix and Amazon at the current time.
BEAR5|They're just simply overvalued and there's too many other good buys out there like Google and Facebook that had better financials.
NEUT6|And if you didn't catch my video on those top tech stocks, I'll go ahead and drop the link down below.
NEUT7|You'll definitely want to check that out because I go into a lot of detail on the rest of the reasons that I'm about to cover right now.
BEAR8|#2 Netflix is earnings per share is 3 to four times lower than that of the other top tech stocks.
BEAR9|There's just simply too many other better options out there.
NEUT10|#3 Netflix PE ratio is over 99, and that's absolutely nuts.
BULL11|It should be under 30 to be competitive with the other top tech stocks.
BEAR12|#4 Netflix has a low income margin that's below 10%.
BULL13|We can do better than that.
NEUT14|Number 5.
NEUT15|The Netflix operating margin is only 12.9% number 6 Netflix has a high debt to equity ratio, and what that means is it's a higher risk for shareholders.
NEUT16|How high is it?
BULL17|Well, it's actually 11 times higher than that of Facebook's number 7.
BEAR18|The Netflix price is already over what most analysts were projecting #8.
BEAR19|Netflix has a book value ratio of .04 and that book value ratio is so low.
NEUT20|I literally had to stop the video open up my spreadsheet and double check my numbers.
BEAR21|It's really that low #9 Netflix has the most sell recommendations out of all of the big tech stocks and #10.
BEAR22|The Netflix RSI is hovering at the overbought amount.
NEUT23|Those are my top 10 reasons on why you should hold off on buying Netflix, and if you want a complete breakdown and explanation of everything.
NEUT24|I just went over in this short short video, then I'll leave the link down below and you can check out all those details there.
NEUT25|I put a lot of time, effort and work into my spreadsheets and videos and if you want to see more of them then all I ask is that you give the video a like and subscribe.
NEUT26|As long as the channel is growing, I'll keep on producing these videos for you.
