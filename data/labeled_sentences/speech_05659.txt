NEUT1|About Pontiacs I.
NEUT2|Highly suggest you invest in this cryptocurrency.
NEUT3|There is a chance that it could be sitting around $0.15 then the end of the year.
NEUT4|And that means if you invest $100 now.
NEUT5|It could potentially be worth $1500 by the end of the year.
NEUT6|All you have to do is buy.
NEUT7|And forget about it.
NEUT8|Some reasons why.
NEUT9|As you can see, there's not a whole lot of selection when it comes to exchanges.
NEUT10|If this gets listed on Binance will be etc.
NEUT11|Lot of money is looking for into it.
NEUT12|They already have a working product.
NEUT13|They're also partnering with Wanchain.
NEUT14|Bit thumb.
NEUT15|See if I can find their Twitter here.
NEUT16|I'm going to get there.
NEUT17|Social constantly posting on social media.
NEUT18|Also.
BULL19|Starting to collaborate with American Chamber of Commerce.
NEUT20|In Korea.

NEUT22|So they're trying to get on exchanges.
NEUT23|They have meetups.
NEUT24|Launch in partnership.
BEAR25|Yeah already working product which you see huge because there's not that many working problems 2018.
NEUT26|No.
BULL27|Chances for 15 times return on investment.
NEUT28|So $1000 could literally be worth $15,000 by the end of the year.
NEUT29|I'm not a financial advisor, so I could be wrong.
BEAR30|But I do not see this crypto going down in value.
NEUT31|Is.
NEUT32|The adoption determines.
NEUT33|Bigger and more widespread.
NEUT34|Yes.
