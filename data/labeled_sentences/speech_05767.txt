BULL0|"""Remember it comes as many retailers are closing physical stores around the world, so Amazon is ramping up its e-commerce capacity."
BULL1|Hiring 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers and raising their pay by $2.00 an hour through April.
NEUT2|This is an investment, it says of $350 million globally.
NEUT3|Now, of course consumers.
BULL4|They're turning to online deliveries amid the Corona virus outbreak in Amazon, which makes up about 40% of the E Commerce market here in the US, is seeing a major increase in demand for everything from toilet paper to cleaning supplies to groceries through Whole Foods.
NEUT5|I'm sure many of our audience.
NEUT6|Have seen this and experience this now.
BULL7|Amazon is also working with the Trump administration despite a tense relationship in the past.
NEUT8|At the press conference this afternoon, President Trump was asked if he was in contact with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.
NEUT9|He said, yeah, some of his people had been dealing with him.
NEUT10|We also know that Amazon is part of a broader tech task force, working with the White House guys, Sarah, Dear Joe.
NEUT11|One question I always get with the deliveries is, is it safe that people have been handling all of our deliveries and can we make contact with them when they come to the door?
NEUT12|Does the company give any guidance on that?
NEUT13|Now we've seen so many companies, not just Amazon.
NEUT14|All the food delivery companies like DoorDash, Postmates, and Uber eats have this no contact delivery so they will leave your meal or an Amazon package outside the door so that there doesn't have to be any actual human transaction.
NEUT15|So that's one way in which they're dealing with us.
BULL16|"Deirdre Bosa, thank you."""
