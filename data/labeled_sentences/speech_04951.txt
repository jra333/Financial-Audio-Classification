BULL0|"""Hello guys, welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|So in this video I'm going to be talking about MV ISO MBI is had an OK day.
BULL2|It moved up by $0.15 so it is actually a good thing for MBS after a harami which is basically a bearish signal to come and close about this support level of $15.64.
NEUT3|It's big because this actually would have.
NEUT4|Traded to the downside, if this harami would have actually played to the downside, but since it didn't, it is a it's kind of a bullish sign, so we should kind of see.
NEUT5|Maybe it break about the $17.41 if we can keep this going going into tomorrow.
NEUT6|So let's see what kind of an action we get on MBI is going into tomorrow and in terms of the trend, the trend seems to be pretty strongly to the upside.
BEAR7|And today's volume was kind of very low, so that is also not a great thing, but maybe we can follow up tomorrow with a great volume and that should kind again.
NEUT8|Give us the big green upside candle in terms of the mckeddie seem to be just about the.
NEUT9|About the yellow line Golden line.
BULL10|So which is kind of a still positive.
NEUT11|But let's see what happens going into tomorrow and the rest of the week.
NEUT12|If we can just stay above the $17.41.
NEUT13|Going into tomorrow, if we can break that and stay about that then that would be awesome, so that's what I'll be looking for on MVS.
