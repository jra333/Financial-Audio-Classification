NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol NOVN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
BEAR5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward, but overall rough day.
NEUT6|And just to summarize today's price, we went in trading jargon.
NEUT7|This is what would be known as the gap in trap.
NEUT8|Now what do I mean by gap in trap?
NEUT9|If you're new on Friday, the price closed right there and then.
NEUT10|This morning the price opened up there, so that's what is known as the gap up.
BEAR11|And in this situation of pretty big gap up and this is where things get absolutely Savage.
BULL12|The market opened up.
BEAR13|Some poor souls were buying all around this area here.
NEUT14|And then from that point it was just basically all selling pressure.
NEUT15|The rest of the day.
NEUT16|So that's the gap and trap that's taken place, which now brings about a very important level, and one that I would call a muscled area of support moving forward.
NEUT17|And that's it's right there at $0.62.
NEUT18|And that level is very important because I mean and I'm not saying this will occur, but if the price would come down here and then continue on down, what would that be doing?
NEUT19|The price that would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of this area of the chart where it where it had been.
NEUT20|Or in other words, that would imply that the price went from this area all the way up there to then come all the way back down there, not exactly sign of genuine power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT21|Again, I'm not saying this was going to happen, but that is why in my mind, 62 cents is by far a muscled area of support.
NEUT22|Now in the event.
BULL23|The price tries to recover back upwards as far as areas of resistance are concerned, first level going to keep an eye on would be there at the 68 cent mark and then after Whoops after $0.68.
NEUT24|A next level after that point would be right up there around 72.
NEUT25|So 6872 next couple key battlegrounds moving forward.
NEUT26|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT27|Piazza right now things are looking very very shaky, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around.
NEUT28|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT30|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR36|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
