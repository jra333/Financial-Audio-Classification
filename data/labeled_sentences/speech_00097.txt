NEUT0|"""Fiscal year 21 you're talking about digital being as much as 50% of overall revenues."
NEUT1|Given what you've gone through over the last year, could you ever imagine opening another physical store, even your smaller format?
BULL2|Yeah, yes we can.
NEUT3|I think for our Nordstrom stores we don't have any plans to open there.
NEUT4|To state the obvious, hard to see new Maldevelopment going on.
BULL5|But Iraq business we see a lot of opportunity for growth there and it very well could include new physical stores.
NEUT6|And digital, you know 54% this last quarter you see it as much as half of all revenues.
NEUT7|That is where the investment, I guess is going.
NEUT8|Tell me what Nordstrom really will look like then, as a retailer from here on, given we know it of course by those stores by the 300 and 249 rack stores and 100 full line stores.
NEUT9|But really digital seems to be the future for this company.
NEUT10|Well, it's really a combination.
NEUT11|I mean, it has to start the customer.
NEUT12|We put the customer at the center and and customers.
NEUT13|Channel customers customers shop as they want to shop and I think you see in a number of different categories, retailers who've been very successful by leveraging their physical assets and layering on digital assets.
NEUT14|On top of that, that's certainly what we've been investing in over these last several years.
NEUT15|And while we don't know exactly how it will play out.
NEUT16|People will return historic.
NEUT17|We believe in stores.
NEUT18|We believe in digital and our physical portfolio.
BULL19|We have motion storage of Nordstrom Rack stores where you have Nordstrom local service hubs that we've launched in Los Angeles and New York have been very successful for us.
NEUT20|So we really like that mix of physical assets and pairing him with our digital assets.
BULL21|We think we can serve customers better.
NEUT22|I actually recently was in your beautiful store on 57th St in Midtown Manhattan on the West Side.
NEUT23|I was one of the few customers in there.
NEUT24|You know what is the future for store like that?
NEUT25|I mean when you say get back to sort of normal, do you expect that customer counts will return to what they were in 2019 in stores like that?
NEUT26|Now we don't think normal is going back to pre pandemic levels, but I mean this is a strange time, particularly big urban centers.
NEUT27|You don't have office workers don't have tourism.
BEAR28|For what we sell, you know there's there's headwinds that Pandemic has brought for a lot of fashion.
NEUT29|That is a moment in time that people people will return to getting out and getting out months, people and interested in getting something new.
BEAR30|And that day is looks more short than ever with vaccines rolling out.
NEUT31|So yeah, we we do believe in physical stores and in particular New York, NY's unlike any city early in the world and really love our location there and how that that stores come out.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
