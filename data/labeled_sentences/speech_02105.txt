NEUT0|"""Who is Mike Terry?"
NEUT1|Want talk about Coca Cola Coca Cola?
NEUT2|Have one of the best days ever.
BULL3|I think in about a year it was up 6%.
NEUT4|But here's what's most notable.
BULL5|It has hit a new six month high.
BULL6|So that means there's definitely some room to run on Coca Cola.
NEUT7|I said in a previous video, I don't know how long this rotation into value stocks is going to play out.
NEUT8|I think maybe this just might be a one week or two.
NEUT9|Think two week thing.
BULL10|However, I do think Coca Cola does have a chance to go on a little bit of a run.
NEUT11|If you're looking for a safer stock that pays a nice dividend of 3.12% Coca Cola, one of the best, most recognizable brands in the world, I think one of the reasons why I could run.
NEUT12|It's like it's done really not much for the past five years.
BEAR13|It did have a run up in 2019, but then with the March 2020 crash it lost a huge amount.
BULL14|So I do think it's going to work its way back up and get back up to this pre crash high, which is $60.00.
NEUT15|It's really only about 15% away so.
NEUT16|I think it could.
BULL17|I could definitely think Coca Cola can get back up to the $60.00 level within the next six months.
NEUT18|So if you are looking for a safe stock that could give you some outperformance in play a dividend, the dividend is 3.12%.
NEUT19|I think Coca Cola is the way to go.
BULL20|And also if you want to hold Coca Cola long-term Coca Cola has had 58 straight years of raising its dividend last year.
BULL21|Racist dividend by 2.5%.
NEUT22|So if you are looking for something long term, the good thing about a stock like Coca Cola, even though Coca Cola.
NEUT23|Doesn't move much is that you can get paid from your stock whatever having to sell your stock.
NEUT24|And sometimes if you have like a huge portfolio.
NEUT25|If you have like a multi $1,000,000 portfolio you probably don't want to be Biden selling too much because of the capital gains implications, especially short term capital gains implications.
NEUT26|So if you have a lot of money, if you have a multi $1,000,000 portfolio it's great to have a portfolio that pays maybe a 3% and then just you're able to pull 3%.
NEUT27|In cash every yo you get 3% of your portfolio every year.
NEUT28|Well maybe your profile assisted dividend paying stock.
BULL29|It doesn't move up 9% a year like the S&P, but maybe you get 5 to 6% average gains and that's a pretty good strategy to go.
NEUT30|But I really like Coca Cola at this point.
BEAR31|I do think one of the threats like Coca Cola have was peoples were beginning to have some aversion to sugar and move away and and also a version 2.
NEUT32|Diet soda products.
NEUT33|Because those have asked pertained and people learning about the health implications have aspartame.
NEUT34|So I think Coca Cola have allowed those punks.
NEUT35|I know they've diversified into water water products.
NEUT36|I think they'll figure that out.
NEUT37|I mean, Coca Cola is a huge company.
BULL38|They have more market experience in drinks than anybody else on the planet, so I think they'll be able to diversify their portfolio enough to get that more than just sugar products in artificial sweetener product.
NEUT39|So definitely take a look at Coca Cola if you're looking at a value play, so I hope you enjoyed this video.
