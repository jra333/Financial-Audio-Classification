BULL0|"""Good evening guys."
NEUT1|Welcome to another video.
NEUT2|In this video, we're going to look at the stock Facebook and see whether it's offering any second printer point or not.
BEAR3|It's very dark mode, almost 23%, since it's added to the tracker.
NEUT4|So after day 623 we will take a real quick look at this chart and see whether it's offering in a secondary entry point or not.
NEUT5|So let's get started.
NEUT6|So before we dive into it, please take a look at our website and our social media site.
NEUT7|I hope you find this all the information of that is useful, so please check it out when you get a chance.
BULL8|So the stock has added to the tracker on for tonight and with the interpreter price around 194 and as of now it is trading around 239 and it is posting almost at 23% plus gains as of today and avoiding the stop loss was around one 7865 and let's see what its offers.
NEUT9|Any secondary entry point on that?
NEUT10|I think it's up for a second appointment on May 5th.
NEUT11|It was trading around 4/4 then again on June 16 when it was around 2:37 and June 23, again around 239.
BEAR12|That's the price range, so it is still failing within the price zone of 239 to 251 and the stop loss is around 2:20.
NEUT13|So if you look at the stock chart, it was headed for the track around this area when it cleared the 50 day moving average, and it's clear that only moving average after that, and it added a consolidation so it offered by quite over here the reason for the recent high point is it is trading almost 4-5 weeks sideways and it's closing between the range and as of today.
BULL14|It's now started rallying little bit higher.
BULL15|It's still flattered in much.
BULL16|But still it closed at the top end of the range, and this consolidation would get cleared at anytime if the market holds up.
NEUT17|So that is a reason.
NEUT18|And now I want to put more stress on the second entry point so it looks favorable for now.
NEUT19|So again, the second entry points are not as powerful as the first level entry point.
NEUT20|Our first entry point, so we may want to start with the pilot by and see how things goes.
NEUT21|An as you start accumulating more gains that you cannot keep up.
BULL22|Adding the stock permitting up so this is a weekly settings and it's still trading well above its 50 day moving average and way above its story moving average, which is a good sign and it's consolidating for last five weeks and hopefully you know it can barely from this point onwards.
NEUT23|And let's see how things goes from here.
NEUT24|You can check the tracker every day and the packet is getting updated with the end of the day stock data so we can see the performance and let's see how things behave.
