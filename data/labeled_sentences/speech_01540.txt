BEAR0|"""Beware, the stock market is overvalued."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL2|Will you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times?
BULL3|There are noteworthy signs that stock market is overvalued.
NEUT4|Most striking is the overall value of equities.
BEAR5|Visa vie our GDP stocks are now worth about 180% of GDP, a level not seen since 2000 after stock indexes reached a high early that year, they fell into a bone crunching bear market.
NEUT6|Other factors signaling caution.
BEAR7|Our recent initial public offerings IPOs, which have gone up some of them 80% or more from their initial offering price, is this kind of fraud.
NEUT8|Business is traditionally not healthy.
NEUT9|Along the same lines, there's been the eye popping boom and specs special purpose acquisition companies.
NEUT10|ASPAC has nothing inside it except the promise that will soon by a company.
NEUT11|It's a way for a Corporation to go public without the laborious root of her traditional IPO.
BEAR12|Stock market optimists, though point to two bullish factors.
NEUT13|One is enormous amount of cash still available to invest.
NEUT14|The other is that by spring, thanks to COVID-19 vaccines, the nightmare of lockdowns will be over.
BULL15|Anna pent up economy will result in a powerful comeback.
BULL16|But there are two important bearish factors that could well mitigate these positives.
NEUT17|One is the wave of anti economic growth regulations that will likely be coming from the new Biden Presidency.
NEUT18|These will adversely impact energy communications, high tech companies, financial institutions, agriculture and many other sectors of the economy.
BEAR19|The extra cost these new rules will particularly hurt new and small businesses.
BEAR20|It is true that such adverse actions will meet a flurry of lawsuits, but they may only delay implementation and the uncertainty of the outcomes will hinder positive capital expenditures by businesses.
BEAR21|The second bearish factors, the Federal Reserve will likely print too much money to pay those multi trillion dollar pandemic relief measures.
BEAR22|Result overtime will be an unexpected inflation.
NEUT23|It is a fools game to try to precisely time when a bull market ends.
NEUT24|What then should an individual investor do?
NEUT25|Three things first, continue to make scheduled payments to your retirement funds.
NEUT26|Don't sell stocks in your 401K's.
NEUT27|In IR A's stocks always come back from bear markets.
NEUT28|Your retirement funds remember are for the long term.
BULL29|Second, for your other Holdings, keep a healthy cash reserve.
BEAR30|If you don't have cash pared down some of your existing investments.
NEUT31|Don't buy new Holdings unless you feel they are truly Special Situations.
NEUT32|Finally, buy some gold, either the yellow metal itself or a sound gold ETF.
NEUT33|Think of this as inflation insurance.
NEUT34|I'm Steve Forbes.
