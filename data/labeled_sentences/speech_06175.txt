NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video value investors."
NEUT1|Today, we're going to be looking at the real value of Dexcom what's Dex Coms?
NEUT2|Intrinsic value, little start.
NEUT3|Dexcom is a company that develops manufacturers and distributes continuous glucose monitoring systems for folks with diabetes.
NEUT4|Now, instantly, there's a contingency that I see.
NEUT5|And that's the fact that Dexcom makes its money from folks who are unfortunately sick.
NEUT6|So if those folks get healthy, right?
NEUT7|And that's really the trend these days for most of the developed world.
BEAR8|To become healthier than Dexcom, suddenly loses its on its value proposition.
BULL9|So we're already weary in 2018, they've made $1.032 billion, which is excellent.
NEUT10|You can see that here.
NEUT11|And they were founded in 1999.
NEUT12|But what I want to know is, what's where is it standing on now?
NEUT13|What's its intrinsic value and what's its actual share price?
NEUT14|Then we can make a decision on an investment.
NEUT15|So currently its intrinsic value lies on a range and on the low end of things we're looking at $0.91 per share.
NEUT16|And this is based off of Dex Coms, cash and cash equivalents, right?
NEUT17|So for every share that it has, it has $0.91 in cash and cash equivalents about on the high end of things.
BEAR18|Well, on the high end it has negative $11.74.
NEUT19|In value right?
NEUT20|And this is based if you look at the address bar here that function, right?
BEAR21|This is based off of its net profits media net profit over the last 10 years, which is incredibly negative.
BEAR22|So this is negative.
NEUT23|$54 million * 20, Because this is what Benjamin Graham suggests that our time horizon should be in divided by its total shares outstanding to normalize the figure.
NEUT24|And we get this strange and odd number.
NEUT25|Now what this means is that the company would have to pay.
NEUT26|So we have to pay you $11.74 per share in order to facilitate the transaction.
BEAR27|That's how poor performing this stock is.
NEUT28|It's not good, so we already have the diabetes contingency, right?
NEUT29|They only make money if people are sick, which is not cool.
NEUT30|I mean, I'm not making any moral judgments here, but I'm just saying that it's a contingency that if people are healthy then they're not making money and then also we have the fact that they haven't posted net profits consistently.
BEAR31|They've really only posted net losses on a consistent basis.
NEUT32|So let's proceed forward.
NEUT33|What are they trading at today?
BULL34|Wow, they trading at an astounding $355.02 per share, which is an incredibly large figure.
NEUT35|Of course, we're not going to be investing, but we need some place to park our money, so I don't want to leave you guys out to dry if you need a place to park your money and you're considering an investment in Dex.
NEUT36|Com or some alternative right?
NEUT37|That will maybe NACHA the average, or an S&P 500 index fund, right?
NEUT38|That tracks a certain set of companies and its conservative.
NEUT39|Well, I recommend that you guys invest in the Vanguard 500 index fund the VF iax.
NEUT40|It's the same fund that Warren Buffett used in 2008 to beat out the hedge fund folks in his famous bet where he was $1,000,000 bet and he said I bet you I can buy this fund and do nothing and beat you guys beat the professionals in New York City and that's exactly what happened.
NEUT41|You won the bet in 2018 so parking money here.
NEUT42|It's relatively the same price, just a couple dollars cheaper.
NEUT43|As a matter of fact and look at that strong trendline in the upward direction.
NEUT44|So this is where I would park your money until.
NEUT45|This figure?
NEUT46|Well it's not even about their share price.
NEUT47|They just need to start posting some net profits, right?
NEUT48|They can't have this.
NEUT49|Is consistent net losses.
