NEUT0|"""I'm Eric Butler from Menlo Park, CA."
NEUT1|A couple of questions, one serious one, not quite considering.
NEUT2|Berkshire Hathaway is well run at low cost and is diversified.
NEUT3|Why should anyone do anything but put all their money?
NEUT4|Into Berkshire Hathaway, instead of maintaining a diversified portfolio.
NEUT5|An in some of these.
NEUT6|Hit your graphic kind of biographies.
NEUT7|It is apparent that you have other investments yourself beyond Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT8|The second question I had is there any significance to the fact that the.
NEUT9|Omaha World Herald does not include Berkshire Hathaway in its stock tables on any day.
NEUT10|Is this a sign that?
NEUT11|They do not honor profits now.
NEUT12|They actually they have a separate little table called Midlands.
NEUT13|I think it's entitled Midlands investment but they they they pick out about.
NEUT14|50 stocks that are of particular interest to people in this area, an.
NEUT15|They lift those from the regular table and put it in this separate table, which is usually on a second page right following the main stock table, so they they give us are just do on that.
NEUT16|But you do have to.
NEUT17|You should look in a different table for that.
NEUT18|Second question, by putting all your money and I've got 99%.
NEUT19|My money in in Berkshire an but it was bought at a different price.
NEUT20|Ann Charlies was bought little cheaper do I think so you know we we we like the idea of having it all in there but we don't recommend that.
NEUT21|People do that because it's you will get very low cost management.
NEUT22|What we hope well we hope is that from this point forward that that cost does not reflect its value, but.
NEUT23|The price at which you enter is very important.
BULL24|You do get a great group of businesses.
BULL25|You get a lot of great operating managers.
NEUT26|You get very reasonable costs.
NEUT27|But that is fairly widely recognized now compared to the past and people.
NEUT28|People pay more for it than they used to it.
NEUT29|I'm still very comfortable with it, and I think Charlie's comfortable with it too, but but everyone has to make up their own mind about about price Charlie.
NEUT30|Yeah, eventually.
NEUT31|If the success continues and we have more of this hagiography.
NEUT32|The stock will get such a high price that it's.
NEUT33|No longer.
NEUT34|Sensible at all to buy.
NEUT35|We hope we.
NEUT36|Dampen that process this week.
NEUT37|As we go along, you know.
NEUT38|And of course, there's always the very substantial chance that.
NEUT39|Will just fail to.
NEUT40|"Meet expectations due to the vicissitude's of life falling on her face is what we call it."""
