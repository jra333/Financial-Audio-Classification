NEUT0|"""Close eye on shares of giant Chinese Internet companies."
NEUT1|Alibaba course.
NEUT2|Perhaps the one best known to our viewers.
NEUT3|It had been a beneficiary of this.
BULL4|In part because of the strength of the Chinese consumer.
BULL5|The fact that they actually came out of the covid pandemic at least much quick more quickly than we have, and certainly other Western nations just because of the growth of the company.
BEAR6|But the stock has been getting hit lately.
NEUT7|It we're keeping an eye on it today.
BEAR8|Got hit badly yesterday as well.
NEUT9|Jim, as you know about 10:40 I mentioned 10:50 I mentioned something on air about Chinese regulate.
NEUT10|Actions they were out yesterday morning and so there was an opportunity then and during the course of day for it to be sold and it has been we're watching Tencent also and JD, but we're still trying to understand more exactly about what these new opinions on antitrust regulations that are being sought by Sam are.
NEUT11|The antitrust regulator in China will mean for the likes of these companies, and there's some of the draft antitrust rules price discrimination based on data bundling of sales, restricting sellers to one platform.
NEUT12|And yet they will seek public comment until November 30th.
NEUT13|If you needed any evidence of the influence of the Chinese government on so many companies, in particular, Alibaba, you've gotten it over the last week.
NEUT14|I mean the Ant financial IPO being postponed indefinitely will see if and when that thing actually comes back would have been the largest IPO of all time.
BEAR15|A change in potential regulations over parts of their business had them shelve it after Jack Mob Chorus, the company's founder said some things that perhaps may have run Rodman put him in.
BEAR16|Kind of a bad place with regulators Jim and then this comes out yesterday morning our time and we're watching these stocks get hit again.
BULL17|Well I mean Alibaba is up dramatically from where it was.
NEUT18|It's a 4:00 AM but but I would say this.
NEUT19|This reminds me of the capitalist rotors.
NEUT20|In the PNP RC where the campus voters were slapped down, remember there was an opening of China and then I go back David.
NEUT21|Is it possible that Jack MA is perceived to be more powerful than the government once any one person to be well, he is incredibly wealthy.
NEUT22|He does have an incredible following that's, but I don't know.
NEUT23|I mean, they won't allow it.
NEUT24|They won't allow it.
NEUT25|And you know, but held in their show me, they have to maintain control.
NEUT26|They do.
BEAR27|They slapped him down.
NEUT28|They showed what they can do.
NEUT29|OK, but let's see usually last week.
NEUT30|What Europe is saying about Amazon.
NEUT31|Yeah, it's like they borrowed the copy of Bill particulars in China against their own people.
BEAR32|They're worried about monopolistic practices of some of these Internet Giants and what it will mean.
NEUT33|I mean, in the same way that we are exactly that's what I'm saying, yes, but the difference is is that that they are communists.
NEUT34|If they wanted to, they could put Japon prison.
NEUT35|I guess they are, and they don't necessarily need to rely on a court of law.
NEUT36|Agreed with them and make the argument that gets that agreement.
NEUT37|That's true, they can move more swiftly.
NEUT38|Don't they have kangaroo courts over there?
NEUT39|They actually, you know, better than I would in terms of what this state of play isn't there in terms of their state of.
NEUT40|The law and administration of that law, Jim, but yeah, they can listen.
NEUT41|They got till the end of the month to get comments.
NEUT42|You could see something pretty quickly, but we'll see Carl how much of an impact it actually will have on the business.
NEUT43|So we gotta watch this because Chinese Communists don't act like this.
BULL44|They've been steady hands.
NEUT45|Yeah, well, you don't want to see volatility out of that region.
BEAR46|Too much guys and it's certainly overshadowed singles day.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
