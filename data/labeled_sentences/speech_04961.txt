NEUT0|"""So really, all I did to find this position is I Google search."
NEUT1|Where is Facebook headed and these were the results.
NEUT2|So I did the most reasonable thing.
NEUT3|What's going on?
NEUT4|Everyone and welcome back to the channel, and today I'm going to be talking about my next options trade and the company that I have bought options calls for is hold up and look for it real quick, right here.
NEUT5|It's Facebook.
NEUT6|So social media right now.
NEUT7|If you look at like Snapchat, Facebook, a lot of these tech Giants, even though they're going under a lot of scrutiny right now.
BEAR8|So they've been getting punished for these past couple weeks, and in Facebook's case months, if you go to a three month chart, you see their overall down and then on the last month there's really going to be in town.
NEUT9|Same with the last week and today was no different so.
BEAR10|After seeing Facebook drop from 270 because keep in mind I have this in my Roth IRA Ray, so I see it every now and then.
NEUT11|I don't track Facebook too closely.
BULL12|I trust it's going to go up.
BEAR13|For the long term, and I get a notification that Facebook is down 2%.
NEUT14|And then I check, check out what's going on with the company and I see that I set 2:40.
NEUT15|Not precisely 240, but it's in the two 40s.
NEUT16|Like right now.
NEUT17|You know, $246.
BEAR18|And in my head, I was like there's no way that Facebook is valued at 246 right now and I'm looking into what's been happening with been going on with Facebook these past couple weeks and months and I still have an overall bullish sentiment on Facebook.
NEUT19|So what I did to hedge on this is I bought some options calls on it, so take you over.
NEUT20|We will right now and if we go over to Facebook.
BEAR21|My bad, it's actually in my positions over here.
NEUT22|I have two options calls, one of them is a short term, one of them is a longer term call, one that expires next week.
BEAR23|Both of them have the same strike price of $247.50 and the one that expires next week.
NEUT24|I'm really going to flip it real quick tomorrow.
BULL25|I'm hoping that Facebook has a Green Day that's already up in the after hours and I'm just hoping that Facebook has some kind of a quick jump tomorrow recovers from this a little bit and I'm just going to flip this call for some quick profits.
NEUT26|Then the second one that I have expiring in February.
NEUT27|The reason why I picked this contract is it's after their earnings report, so if worse comes to worse.
BULL28|If this continues to drop hoping and I'm also like pretty sure that Facebook is going to be on their earnings and hopefully that sends the stock going up and it will recover that way.
NEUT29|And if it doesn't again I still have until February a whole other month after they release their earnings for it to recoup some of its value.
NEUT30|So that's the plan between these two contracts and tomorrow morning I'll record to see if my.
BULL31|Small short term contract worked out and if not, well.
BEAR32|It's a loss.
NEUT33|You can't win them all, but that was offered today.
BULL34|Thank you all for watching and there's just so many more new subscribers.
BULL35|It's getting me excited.
NEUT36|I have 68 hour so close to 100 subscribers and I just want to say that I love all of you.
BULL37|"You're all great, you're all awesome and I hope you have a great day."""
