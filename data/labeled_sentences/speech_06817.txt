NEUT1|This is crypto big boss coming to you with a quick price prediction.
NEUT2|Update A back in January if you guys remember.
NEUT3|I sat down and talk to you guys about Tezos and how that platform has evolved to become a real player in this space and during those price predictions.
NEUT4|I basically said that Tezos was going to hit $14.00 before close of business 2021.
NEUT5|I did say that there was going to be a pullback $3.50 and I said that after it got over that $3.50 there was going to be a shoot to the moon.
NEUT6|Right now we can see the shooting has begun.
NEUT7|Here we are with Tezos headed headed to the moon $5.34 if we take a look at this graph you can see in the last seven days.
NEUT8|Let's just take a look at this.
NEUT9|Look at how it is just skittering up it skittering up once he got past that $3.50.
NEUT10|It was on let's take a list.
