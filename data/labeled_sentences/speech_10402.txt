BEAR0|"""If you're looking at the New York Post website for correction of that story they wrote about on Monday about how December wasn't starting out so good, I had written how wrong you were going to be out there."
NEUT1|Not I'm not.
NEUT2|It's not forthcoming, I don't think, but you were exactly right about number.
BULL3|The economic backdrop, and there's good things happening.
NEUT4|And it validates some of the moves, right?
NEUT5|Growth with very little inflation.
NEUT6|I wish people were making a little more money.
BULL7|Obviously Joe, we want people to make more money.
NEUT8|There's a felt by him.
NEUT9|Michael symbols.
NEUT10|I don't know if you know him, but he is the.
NEUT11|Chairman of Marketing investment strategy at JP JP Morgan.
NEUT12|He came up with a list of what the cable companies cable, CNN, MSN, Weather.
NEUT13|They cover the number 16th.
BULL14|16th is positive economic news.
NEUT15|All the rest of them are negative so you know what's going on here.
NEUT16|Joe.
BULL17|People don't want to say good things and this is the best number I've ever seen in my life.
NEUT18|Is it gonna?
NEUT19|Is it?
NEUT20|Well, I said this earlier and is it cannot last forever Jim, how can it last forever and less?
BEAR21|It's a participation rate and if you know I think it has to go up Joe because when we win the trade war, which you know we're going to win now, 'cause we have better numbers then they're going to have to put jobs here.
NEUT22|That's what they're going to do.
NEUT23|Not even talking about that yet.
BEAR24|In the end, the Chinese have to put jobs here because this thing is the president can walk away from the table with this number you are so anti normal knee jerk.
BULL25|Thinking of the MSM so we could actually have more jobs coming back if we win the trade war.
NEUT26|No, you won't see that written or said anywhere.
NEUT27|Well, you know, sometimes the truth sets people free.
NEUT28|Yeah, that's a beautiful love to you and I both know these 50 years.
NEUT29|OK, now I'm 6450 speeding up but I didn't know about things were in 13 -- 13 and 14 other than the war.
NEUT30|But these are I'm not going to say it but he can't.
BULL31|He can't contradict that these are the best numbers of our lives.
NEUT32|Yeah you can't.
NEUT33|I mean we had guns and butter when we were doing these things 50 years ago and that followed with inflation and recession.
NEUT34|I don't see inflation.
NEUT35|I don't see recession.
NEUT36|50 years ago, that number was a curse.
NEUT37|Now it's a blessing and you know something Joe it doesn't.
NEUT38|I can't.
NEUT39|It doesn't matter whether you hate him or like him.
NEUT40|These are real numbers.
NEUT41|Someone said Janet Yellen numbers that was funny, but it's 1969.
NEUT42|That's literally I've been alive.
NEUT43|I mean, what am I going to do?
NEUT44|"I'm not from the Navin Johnson School of Economics."""
