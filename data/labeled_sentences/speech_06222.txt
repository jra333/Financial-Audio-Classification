NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart ticker symbol am ZN, Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I want anyways just to establish some Contacts here, but very impressive move today.
BULL5|I mean you something about the fact that just on Monday the price was all the way down here and now the price has been able to battle back up to where it has.
NEUT6|So yeah, there's still work that needs to be done.
NEUT7|But my point here is that, relatively speaking from where it was to where it was able to fight back up to nice salad move.
NEUT8|But that does bring about the more than valid question of, but is there any sort of true power behind this pricing?
NEUT9|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce, site move and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward.
NEUT12|In my mind, in our village on a single area, and that area is right here at the 3000 Mark now Wise 3000 important and I'm not saying that this was going to happen, but let's just say that the price comes down to 3000, behaves like that and then continues on down.
NEUT13|What would you have at that point?
NEUT14|Time?
NEUT15|Well, you would quite literally have the price right back to where it started.
NEUT16|An not to insult your intelligence but price movements that go right back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power.
NEUT17|Choose strength or anything like that.
NEUT18|But to be fair, no, pricing goes straight up so maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner.
NEUT19|Then sort of works way back upwards novice.
NEUT20|A sudden what would you have while you have a set of those right there, you have loads down there.
NEUT21|If you envision each one of those stair steps, well, there you go.
NEUT22|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
NEUT23|That's what a truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL24|It's going to make progress and again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as at the 3000 mark as far as areas of resistance are concern.
NEUT25|First key area of resistance is going to be the Purple line right there which on my charger notes the very well known.
NEUT26|The very famous 50.
NEUT27|Moving average and will just call its value at 3075, so 3075 the initial level.
NEUT28|And then the next key battleground after that.
BULL29|I'm going to be right up there at around 3085, but All in all, very nice bounce today.
NEUT30|Not just the question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT33|But it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
