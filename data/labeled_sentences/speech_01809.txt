NEUT0|"""So what is going on with Apple stock and do I still hold my open position?"
NEUT1|Of course I do.
BULL2|So what's going on team, it's tricky with tech, but solutions as you guys can see it shows that I'm up on the day altogether.
NEUT3|It shows that I'm up on the open, which is not true just because I've been day trading it day by day.
NEUT4|And this is something that I spoke about in the very beginning of when I made the overall video.
NEUT5|When I bought $10,000 of Apple at 100 shares, I said that the more it sells off, the more I will buy at significant price points.
NEUT6|And today I plan to buy another 100 shares or invest in another 100 shares and again.
NEUT7|It has to do with your overall intention.
NEUT8|My intention right now with Apple is to be able to buy it for a good deal, be able to hold it so I don't care if it continues to sell off my position.
NEUT9|Size is much smaller in comparison to what I plan to be in, so an example is if you're going to invest in Apple $1000, that's your goal and you only buy 100 shares of Apple.
BEAR10|If Apple drops 5 or 10% when you only have $100 when your goal is to have $1000, it's not going to matter that much because your position size is so small, which still allows you.
NEUT11|Just a cool, calm and collected, and that's essentially what I'm trying to do right now is because I'm day trading with the remaining shares, meaning that I keep the 100 shares all the time.
NEUT12|I'll buy an additional 15 to maybe an additional 100 shares and all day trade with those and then sell them, but I'll keep the original 100 if that makes sense.
NEUT13|So this just allows me to make some money off of Apple intraday by being able to let you know by the Lowe's and sell the highs and stuff like that.
NEUT14|So overall, very exciting Apple is a little bit more on the overbought side on the day so that's definitely something that we need to take into consideration now.
BULL15|One of the things that I also want to talk about is now that I covered my, you know, open position on Apple is one of the things that I'm looking at right now is because the overall market just pushed up based off of previous highs.
BULL16|Now we're looking to be a little bit more in the overbought signals, not that I think that the market is going to sell all the way right back down to previous support levels, but because it pushed up so much I now took a position on SQ&S cues.
BEAR17|Again goes up when the overall market goes down, so I'm anticipating based off of previous patterns that this thing is going to pull back a little bit.
BULL18|Then at least I can make some money once we get proper confirmation.
NEUT19|And of course, the more it sells off, the more money I'll be adding to my askew's position.
BEAR20|But if we continue to indicate signs of an option, then I'll have to closeout that position, but so far as of right now I'm up a little bit over $2000 on the day.
BULL21|I still have my open positions there, but again, I'm very, very excited to see where the day goes if this thing continues to sell off and I should be able to hit about.
NEUT22|$2500 to $3000 profit on the day.
BEAR23|But if this thing continues to push up, then I'm going to closeout my position on SQQQ and I'll most likely just manage my risk to try to stay above $1800 profit on the day.
BULL24|So at least you know I give it some wiggle room, but not so much wind up giving back all of my profits that I was able to make it.
NEUT25|You guys let me know.
NEUT26|Do you think that Apple is a good buy right now?
NEUT27|Again, not as a trade right?
NEUT28|I'm not buying it to try to sell it tomorrow, but do you think that it would make a good investment long term?
