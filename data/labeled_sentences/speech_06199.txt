NEUT0|"""Not at all."
NEUT1|Well, it's Friday, everybody and what we're looking at here just so everyone knows is a weekly chart on Amazon.com.
NEUT2|And basically the SMF Pro trading students are looking at the difference between bear and bull trend cycles.
NEUT3|Add when the.
NEUT4|Can people hear me?
NEUT5|OK, so excuse me.
BEAR6|There's going to be a little interruption on this tape.
NEUT7|You'll have to live with it.
NEUT8|Is that a couple of major key things have happened.
BEAR9|We rolled over 10 week rolled down.
BEAR10|And that meant that Amazon was in a bear reversal trend 1234567 weeks below that, ten week ten week was descending, but now check it out.
NEUT11|The ten week is flat and just the opposite of the bear.
BULL12|SMF Bear Qualifier trend is that we have come back up and we had 1234 weeks above the ten week and the ten week is flat.
NEUT13|It's pointing up.
BULL14|The 20 week is holding it up.
NEUT15|So we are not in the bear trend that we were over here.
BEAR16|That that was a bear reversal from the long term bull trend over here.
NEUT17|Basically what we've done is we have broken that bear reversal from January end of December, and now that Blue line is a 10 week moving average, it's flat.
NEUT18|We've got four weeks closing price above it.
BULL19|We're back up toward the 52 week I reversal.
NEUT20|Which remains up here.
NEUT21|This blue line is a 10 week half of that weekly bars about right there.
BULL22|And basically we have consolidated the high of that weekly breakout bar.
NEUT23|Which is bullish?
NEUT24|And when I take out this trend line, it's when you can consolidate the high of a weekly bar, daily bar monthly, 3 minutes, 15 or 16 minutes bar.
NEUT25|We're holding the high end.
NEUT26|And the support level is the high of that bar.
BULL27|The bodies are closing right on the high that this weekly breakout bar and we got a 20 rising week.
BULL28|We've got the ten week coming up behind it.
NEUT29|So basically, as of right now, with four weeks above it, that is constant, that provides the bull trend.
BEAR30|"We have had a bear reversal here to a bowl."""
