NEUT0|"""Bezos sold some Amazon shares just around 3 billion."
NEUT1|That's three Billy's just the way you like to.
NEUT2|The phrase you like to use for billions, 3 Billy's.
NEUT3|Did you know since your name is well, you can also choose to be called Bill if you want it.
NEUT4|Yeah, you know that, yeah.
NEUT5|And since you like, since you like to talk about the Billy so much, you may you may have a certain at a later date.
NEUT6|You may do that of a T shirt anyways.
NEUT7|Yeah, he sold 3.1 billion.
NEUT8|When you're a guy like him, you want to sell a few billion.
NEUT9|It's a big deal.
NEUT10|You need all kinds of approvals and insider trading, and you have to avoid.
NEUT11|Yet there's a lot of regulations.
NEUT12|Can't just move that kind of money around.
BULL13|The sales this week bring his total cash out in 2020 to slightly more than 7.2 billion.
NEUT14|He is converted.
NEUT15|He loves Amazon.
BULL16|Amazon is doing great right.
NEUT17|He's the richest guy in the world, Amazon booming to the moon.
NEUT18|And he keeps pulling money out and converting stock.
NEUT19|OK, why does he think does he think it's overvalued at the people?
NEUT20|Look into this.
NEUT21|They read into this.
NEUT22|I don't think it's that I think he wants some cash.
NEUT23|OK to buy neighboring houses?
BULL24|Definitely that.
NEUT25|But believe it or not.
NEUT26|7.2 billion is more than houses.
NEUT27|So he has all these properties.
NEUT28|He used some some some of his cash out to buy publication.
NEUT29|Washington Post if you know if you recall that transaction and most importantly he has ventured into, well, he's got a couple of new ventures.
NEUT30|Including his space program, what is that?
NEUT31|What do you call that moon?
NEUT32|Something or other?
NEUT33|Blue, blue origin.
NEUT34|You need to type it.
NEUT35|Well, you see that I googled my mind.
NEUT36|You like that at Google my mind.
NEUT37|Yes, space origin.
NEUT38|That stuff is expensive.
NEUT39|What if he wants to?
NEUT40|He's got so much money on his personal name he could start any company he wants.
NEUT41|He could go if he gets mad enough at Elon, he could just go make some cars real quick.
NEUT42|I mean he did invest in Rivian, right?
NEUT43|Amazon invested in rivian.
NEUT44|I don't know if he's personally an investor in Rivian, but you see how this goes.
NEUT45|You can if when you can pull out billions in real cash.
NEUT46|You can approach some pretty cool.
NEUT47|Projects, so whether it's space or cars or some other types of vehicles or publications he wants to acquire.
NEUT48|Media, there's so many ways in which he could extend his empire, but he can't.
BEAR49|It's hard.
NEUT50|Within Amazon there are certain restrictions as to how he may do that as a person, as a human, as Jeff Bezos with these billions sitting in the pocket, he can kind of do whatever he wants to a certain extent, and so that's probably the reason more than a lack of belief in what Amazon is working on.
BULL51|Or Amazon's continued progression progression towards world, dominance and justice.
NEUT52|To be clear, he pulls 7.2 billion.
NEUT53|"His current shares are worth 170 billion, so let's just chill out for a minute, yeah?"""
