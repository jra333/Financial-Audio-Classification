NEUT0|"""Alright, this is a quick."
NEUT1|A quick video prediction on stock CG hly.
NEUT2|It's late, I'm kind of short on time, so I'm going to be as brief as possible.
NEUT3|The stock is currently 7916 cents.
NEUT4|I'm going to try to get a buy on it tomorrow just under 80.
NEUT5|This stock will not be sold below 20% had beebout 96.
NEUT6|That's a minimum 20%.
NEUT7|Why is this important?
NEUT8|Meryl Price with the T Rowe Price Meryl Lynch?
NEUT9|These brokerages.
NEUT10|What are they trying?
NEUT11|What are they hoping to try to get you in a year?
NEUT12|12 months trying to get you a 10 percent, 12%.
BULL13|I think that's good.
BULL14|That's a hope.
NEUT15|There is no hope here.
NEUT16|I'm telling you this stock is going to produce a minimum, right?
NEUT17|That's a minimum.
BULL18|OK, so it's certainly going much higher.
NEUT19|You probably looking at 140 hundred $50 stock here before it's over with.
BEAR20|So 20% is changed.
NEUT21|But if you're not into that long term, buy and hold strategy in next few months.
NEUT22|This stock is at $80.00 right now.
NEUT23|It will not.
NEUT24|Not give you at least 20%.
NEUT25|That's all I'm looking for.
NEUT26|$80.10 percent would be about $8.88, so 20% be double that that 16.
NEUT27|96 is the minimum.
NEUT28|OK, that $110 price is absolutely false.
NEUT29|Don't believe it.
NEUT30|That is not deleted for this stuck.
NEUT31|I do not know who this company is.
NEUT32|I've done no research.
NEUT33|This is based strictly off of the chart and what it is doing.
NEUT34|OK so $80.00 and will try to purchase this tomorrow.
NEUT35|Would a guarantee of 20% in the near future?
NEUT36|Certainly less than one year?
NEUT37|OK, so here is the time.
NEUT38|I mean the date.
NEUT39|November 3rd Election Day 2020.
NEUT40|Definitely before one year this stock is gonna produce.
NEUT41|At least 20%.
NEUT42|If you got money.
NEUT43|This is where you need to ask some of it by tomorrow.
BULL44|"Thank you."""
