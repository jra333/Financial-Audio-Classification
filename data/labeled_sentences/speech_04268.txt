NEUT0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to another video and today I wanted to talk about Disney stock and kind of give where I think the stock could potentially be headed and where this stock could potentially find demand over the next few days."
BEAR1|So obviously the stock is kind of been dropping along with the SNP as the SNP is kind of building out its ABC wave here, but this stock in particular I think is about to come into a huge demand zone.
NEUT2|So ever since these March lows the stock is kind of completed, a five wave cycle hire and ever since September it's kind of been building out this ABC wave inside of this bull flag.
NEUT3|And the bottom of this bull flags channel is kind of in line with this 38.2% or Treisman at 38.2%.
NEUT4|Retracement is usually where stocks going to retrace on an ABC wave and that sits right at about 1:15 eighty.
NEUT5|That's also the kind of bottom of this bull flag channel.
BULL6|So I do think there's room to at least reach that level over the next couple of days.
NEUT7|But I think there's a significant demand zone there will most likely bounce off that level and then actually see new highs so where you could kind of go around trading this is to maybe take a position at 1:15 eighty.
BEAR8|I think there's an extremely high chance we bounced off that level and then actually break out of this.
NEUT9|Bull flag and you can use this one await level back here which were these previous lows as your stop loss whenever the stock bottoms it should head to the 161.8% extension of this ABC waves range.
NEUT10|That would sit right at about 1:50.
NEUT11|So in this trade you're risking about five points for 35 points.
NEUT12|That gives you around a one to seven rest reward in the trade.
NEUT13|That's a pretty good risk reward trade, so I think when we kind of come into this 115 level, I think you'll get a great entry at about 1:15, one sixteen I think you can use these loads that want to wait as your stop loss.
NEUT14|And I think you can target the previous all time highs at about 1:50, which is the 161.8% extension of this bull.
NEUT15|Flags range.
BULL16|And the yeah, I think we kind of see another five waves higher from there up to those previous size.
NEUT17|Anyways, that's kind of my views on this stock.
BULL18|I do kind of think we see if I will cycle higher after completing this ABC wave down and I think it's going to give you a great entry here at the bottom of this channel in a couple of days using those previous lows as your stop loss.
BULL19|You've got a great risk reward in this trade.
BULL20|An yeah if you enjoyed this video, I hope you on some sort of way.
