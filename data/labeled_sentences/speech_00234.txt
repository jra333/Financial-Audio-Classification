NEUT0|"""As we head into the New year, first up on the docket are Tuesday Senate runoff races in Georgia."
BEAR1|Incumbent Republican senators, David Perdue and Kelly Loffler, are hoping to fend off challengers.
BULL2|Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock to retain control of the Senate could be crucial for markets.
NEUT3|For more.
NEUT4|I'm joined by Tony Fratto.
NEUT5|He's the founding partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and former White House deputy press secretary under President George W Bush.
NEUT6|He's also a CNBC contributor, Tony.
NEUT7|It's good to see you and I mean, let me just start with what is the latest?
NEUT8|Whether you want to call it odds.
NEUT9|Thinking whispers about what's going to happen on Tuesday.
BULL10|I saw some pretty big lines in Georgia today.
NEUT11|Yeah, look.
NEUT12|Obviously the early voting is another theme down there that we're going to see.
NEUT13|If that's closing, I think tomorrow is the last day for early voting down there.
NEUT14|You know every poll that you look at says this is a toss up is all well within the margin of error.
NEUT15|It's it is a real repeat of the November 3rd election.
NEUT16|I think a lot of people were expecting you know, Democratic turn out to over perform in November.
BULL17|I think what we learned was that Republican turn out performed very well too.
BULL18|I think both parties that an amazing job.
NEUT19|Of turnouts at a huge turn out both in early voting absentee and on Election Day, and I think you're going to see the accumulation of that today is going to be very, very close race and you know turn out it's a function of money.
NEUT20|This is the most expensive election in the history of mankind.
NEUT21|There's never been anything like this literally hundreds of millions of dollars being spent down there.
NEUT22|So look if because if there were some under expectation of Republican turn out today, I might.
BEAR23|My expectation is that it's probably a slight lean.
NEUT24|For Purdue and Levler, the two Republican candidates, but that's you know these are guesses.
NEUT25|At this point, Kelly.
NEUT26|Yeah, and we've got so much at stake as well.
NEUT27|I mean, it is interesting to me that we don't see the markets moving more on whatever you want to call it the polls.
NEUT28|The odds may be because the polls are untrustworthy and there's not a whole lot else to look to.
NEUT29|Maybe because like you said it is just a straight toss up so we have to wait and see the outcome.
NEUT30|But you know, a Democrat versus Republican controlled Senate would seem to make a big difference in terms of President Biden's agenda and what gets done on Covid along with a host of other issues.
NEUT31|It's not a blue wave obviously, but still Democratic control of now the presidency.
NEUT32|And the Senate would be much more significant than if it's split, right?
NEUT33|Very much so.
NEUT34|I think we actually have an example of that in live time this week, even just with the $2000 you know top up in the in the covid relief bill.
NEUT35|There's no question.
NEUT36|Even if Republicans and Democrats had control of the Senate, you would see that $2000 top up on the floor today, so the Majority Leader of the Senate is able to control what goes on the floor and in what ways it goes on the floor.
NEUT37|And you know, so leader McConnell chose to pair it with some other pieces of legislation that Democrats aren't going to vote for so.
NEUT38|Controlling the floor is super important.
NEUT39|It will change the ambitions.
NEUT40|I think for for Democrats if they have controlled both houses, even if their razor thin margins, I think you're going to see the the progressive wing get a lot more ambition ambitious on the kinds of things that they want to do, and the kinds of things that they're talking about, especially in the area of energy and climate policy, tax policy, healthcare, and a few other areas.
NEUT41|But the fact that their razor thin in both houses though?
BEAR42|You know that it probably is moderating.
BEAR43|It just brings these moderates in both the Democrats and the Republican Party to the fore.
NEUT44|They are going to be the difference makers.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
