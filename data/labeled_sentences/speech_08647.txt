NEUT1|Hi yeah Jim.

NEUT3|Thank you.
NEUT4|I I invested in fiscal electric carmaker Adam Jonas from JP Morgan, really well respected analyst has a $90.00 bull case price target on the stock.
BULL5|And two weeks ago fiscal is trading above 30 a share.
NEUT6|Now it's in the $17.00 range and it's trading five to six times cheaper.
NEUT7|Afford price to sales ratio.
NEUT8|When you compared to Neil and Tesla, my neighbor.
NEUT9|She's a college student.
NEUT10|Actually, at San Diego State University, she did a survey on the electric car makers 14 of AM fiscal came up with the number one pick on design and appearance.
NEUT11|And number one on the price point and I was just going away so I've ordered a fiscal vehicle.
NEUT12|What do you think?
NEUT13|Should I be buying more?
NEUT14|I mean, this is 1 everyone's allowed to have a couple specula stocks.
