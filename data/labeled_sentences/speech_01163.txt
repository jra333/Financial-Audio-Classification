NEUT0|"""Look, my new bias Porsche so Pete reference Ford I sold for it."
NEUT1|I sold a little early.
NEUT2|I think they have governance issues.
NEUT3|Just put two more family members on the board.
NEUT4|So if you want a family company, it's been mismanaged 50 years.
NEUT5|Then have at it in terms of Porsche though, they are the leader in EV.
NEUT6|Forget about your Lordstown all those others.
NEUT7|This is the place to be.
NEUT8|They have more EV models than any other company out there.
BULL9|They are investing more in infrastructure including battery plants.
NEUT10|Including charging stations, charging networks, and I'll tell you this, Porsche is the way to play it because they own 31% of Volkswagen, they have a couple other assets in there, but this company is selling at a discount to the other European automakers.
NEUT11|It's selling at a discount to the US automakers.
NEUT12|Yet the fundamentals much better and you've got this asset in VW which is called Porsche, and if they ever spun out Porsche, the company said they wouldn't think of this.
NEUT13|That would be worth more than the entire company.
BEAR14|You've got Ferrari that's trading at 45 times earnings where sales were down 10% year over year.
NEUT15|Porsche are, which is about 10% of VW revenues.
BULL16|Their revenues were up 14% Porsche alone year over year.
NEUT17|So what's that worth?
BEAR18|It's not worth the seven times earnings that market is assigning to it.
BULL19|So I think this stock will do incredibly well over the next year.
BULL20|Five years in 10 years particularly, they've got a leading market position in China, so everything stacks up here.
NEUT21|Its new management, the diesel scandals behind it, the other liabilities will be behind it.
NEUT22|It's just clear sailing.
BULL23|Great balance sheet for an auto company.
NEUT24|I just love this one is one of my top positions now actually well I mean the stock is actually absolutely getting a rip as you're talking about.
BULL25|It's up 11%.
NEUT26|It is worth noting I think I'm correct.
NEUT27|I think I heard.
NEUT28|Did the CEO say that the 9/11 is not going to go EV?
NEUT29|Right isn't isn't that?
NEUT30|I think that's noteworthy out of this announcement, right?
NEUT31|I mean, let's not mean to 911 Steve, right?
NEUT32|Well, they have others that that God elect right now, but it's not working and you can't.
NEUT33|You can't buy.
NEUT34|Which is.
NEUT35|I know I had a 911 and Oh yeah, working lectric cars have to be fast.
NEUT36|Now what can I tell you?
NEUT37|My good didn't care.
NEUT38|Come on you gotta play buddy can't be all about work you know apparently so.
NEUT39|Listen to 911 double stacks alright stocks ripping like 12%.
BULL40|"Thank you, Steve."""
