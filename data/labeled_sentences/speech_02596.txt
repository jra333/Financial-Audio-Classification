BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about eBay today so they do auctions ish.
NEUT2|Minor minor part of their businesses auctions these days.
NEUT3|But no, they were the first.
BULL4|They just I guess they're website was just better than the competitors and.
NEUT5|It's the same to this day, which is just barely usable, but so they do, mostly e-commerce these days, which is.
BULL6|Good I guess.
NEUT7|Current stock price $61.00, which gives them market cap of $41.8 billion.
NEUT8|Revenue is $10.3 billion earnings $5.7 billion, which gives them a PE of 15 with a forward PE of 13.
NEUT9|Did 5.7 billion in earnings is not continuous operations, though, so there's some other stuff in there.
NEUT10|Obviously 60%.
BEAR11|Net profit margin is just way too good to be true.
NEUT12|Dividend yield just over 1% with a payout ratio of 18%, which is not terrible.
NEUT13|Total assets $19 billion.
NEUT14|Total liabilities $16 billion, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $3.6 billion, which is not even 10% of their market cap.
NEUT15|But you know, it's a company that runs a website, so there's not a whole lot of assets that they need.
NEUT16|Risk factors.
NEUT17|Game is gone I guess.
NEUT18|There's there's not really a lot going on in terms of new risk factors, and I don't think that anything huge is going to happen.
BEAR19|One of the problems I see is that they are kind of distancing themselves from auctions and just being a platform like Shopify, Amazon, whatever else and so.
NEUT20|They're just one of many at that point and so I don't really see the point of eBay existing in the 1st place, but that's a whole different issue.
NEUT21|Overall, I would say for a growth investor this is definitely not a growth stock anymore and I guess they didn't really make it as far as they thought they would either.
BULL22|For a dividend investor the dividend is not great, but the payout ratio is pretty nice, so if you really wanted to invest in this I wouldn't blame you, but I think there's far better stocks out there.
NEUT23|I would say Intel, IBM, PCT.
NEUT24|Whatever else for a value investor, the balance sheet doesn't look nice.
NEUT25|The P is currently nice, but I'm not sure if that's going to be the case going forward.
BEAR26|Still a PE of 20 ish, which is what they can realistically expect, is not terrible, and so with the balance sheet, that's not.
BEAR27|Quite as terrible as it could be, I guess.
NEUT28|Definitely wouldn't blame anyone for investing in this company either as I had.
NEUT29|I personally don't think I will because I don't really think that they have an itch anymore.
NEUT30|And they are just one of many platforms where people can sell stuff these days.
NEUT31|That's it for me.
