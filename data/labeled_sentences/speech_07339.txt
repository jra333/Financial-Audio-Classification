NEUT1|But of course you have to be sure that liquidity is available to institutions.
NEUT2|A fast moving situation and so that will be the main focus of our attention.
NEUT3|No.
BEAR4|When sentiment turns, we do have a vicious downward spiral.
BEAR5|What we're now waiting for is a sign that that downward spiral is petering out and the bottom has been reached.
NEUT6|But at the moment there's no sign of it.
BULL7|Cheers buddy.
NEUT8|Thanks.
BEAR9|It sounds very glib of me to say that we would consider it to be a correction even at worst when it was 450 points down this morning we were talking about 10% or so, which is less than half the level it was an 87, which is generally accepted to be a crash.
BULL10|So we maintain that the market itself is strong.
BULL11|The economy is strong and we are looking at a correction here.
NEUT12|Play Simon.
NEUT13|50 30 folder.
BEAR14|"I'm sure the the financial media will be writing this up as as Black Tuesday, but certainly this is an important event for investors and for stock markets given the very sharp declines that we've seen globally."""
