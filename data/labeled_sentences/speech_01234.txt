NEUT7|Alright, so this is tickers EOM on the four hour chart.
BULL8|I went ahead and re support and resistance lines an as you can see these 4 hour candle sticks are currently holding up at the moment creating a pretty strong support right here.
NEUT9|It's looking like the Mac dies.
NEUT10|Almost wanting to roll over, but nothing is official until it's official.
NEUT11|So what I want to see is this non email on the actual line come back up here and cross above 240 for a bullish confirmation.

NEUT13|So my algorithms?
NEUT14|They're actually saying an entry point will be 249.
NEUT15|We have to see just based off this setup.
NEUT16|Unless something bad happens, I could see you know this bounce right here, going up here and creating new highs.
NEUT17|"But again, you don't know what the stock market, so just remember to have a stop loss in and be willing to take profits when you have them."""
