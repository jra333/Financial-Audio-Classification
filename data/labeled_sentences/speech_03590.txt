NEUT0|"""What's up YouTube?"
NEUT1|So for this week we're gonna talk about Google.
NEUT2|Google has their event coming up on Tuesday, much like you know Apple, Tesla, and Amazon with their product releases.
NEUT3|Google is Next up to bat, so I want to give you the quick on what I'm watching.
NEUT4|I actually, I'm kind of excited for this one.
NEUT5|I do think the markets are turning around.
BULL6|I think this week is going to be a Green Week.
NEUT7|You know, I don't know if it's going to be a relief rally or a market bottom.
NEUT8|Is this just the best dip by of all time?
BULL9|We're going to push up to somewhere up here kind of lower, high and trend our way down.
NEUT10|I don't know how much hype is going to come from the product.
NEUT11|You know, it's all speculation here.
NEUT12|The next phone you know, stuff like that.
NEUT13|So we'll see when it when it comes out.
NEUT14|But I do want to keep an eye.
NEUT15|I know it's probably really struggle if you play Google at all.
NEUT16|You know it really struggles to get right above this level right here.
NEUT17|This is not the fastest mover in the world, like when it moves, it moves and then it just does some nonsense all day.
NEUT18|We jump into the higher timeframes you can see.
BULL19|We're definitely starting to consolidate though.
NEUT20|Started really hang out and it's really getting bought up right inside here.
NEUT21|So once we actually get a we just got above it Friday and we need to stay above when he.
BEAR22|We need to break this trend with one solid day down, followed by like a green Thursday in an agreed Friday.
BEAR23|All in all though, that's just a pullback for more to the downside.
NEUT24|The trend never actually broke.
BULL25|So you know, once we get above like the 1460 level, you know we definitely probably established a daily uptrend.
BEAR26|As long as we close the day above that 1460, the Daily Trend has now changed.
NEUT27|I'm looking out for that now.
NEUT28|I'm already actually already going to be taking a position and I'm actually keep my stop at the 1390 S 1395 area.
NEUT29|You don't stop out there seeing these Wicks, I might take a smaller position actually, yeah.
NEUT30|I think I will.
NEUT31|Sorry I gotta put the charts.
NEUT32|Tell me 1385 is where I'm definitely wrong.
NEUT33|It could just drop out and be a Wick if I decided anything smaller I might keep my stops a little bit tighter maybe.
NEUT34|Actually yeah, given the fact that.
NEUT35|We might already be gapping up in the morning, you know we'll have to see when we get the morning where we're at on this.
NEUT36|Did we get down to the gap above?
NEUT37|If we already down here, this Type 2 area?
BEAR38|We did gap down there was any kind of profit taking from Friday.
BULL39|I still like the dip by in this zone at that point 1385 will be my stop.
NEUT40|Anything else?
NEUT41|I'll probably keep it at the.
NEUT42|I don't like stopping at 1399.
NEUT43|I'll stop at 1396, Thirteen 96.
NEUT44|I'll just babysit it, might just drop down.
NEUT45|Might be a week.
NEUT46|Might be a giant red candle like this.
NEUT47|I'll keep my stops there, let it tagout probably babysit that day, but I'm thinking we, I think we do push from from zone to zone.
NEUT48|If we do crack above that though, our next area that like the next struggle spot is going to be up whom it's going to be right here.
NEUT49|Nothing but sellers right here, so we need to get above that level.
NEUT50|If that does break my dip by scenario.
NEUT51|My catch the knife.
NEUT52|It's gotta be around here somewhere.
NEUT53|Yeah, actually it's right right here.
NEUT54|As a matter of fact, at that point I'm catching a knife so those are 4 levels that I'm watching.
NEUT55|I'm actually going to be taking the bullish trade this week.
NEUT56|This will be a swing trade.
NEUT57|I want to take advantage of the week since this isn't the fastest mover.
NEUT58|I don't get too excited and catch a couple of grain based like this and then missed out on a bigger move like this not to follow you into any trade.
NEUT59|That's how I'm going to position this one little bit wider.
NEUT60|Stop, let it do its thing, let dance around and you keep my alerts on all of these zones.
NEUT61|"So I landed here guys I will see you in the next video."""
