NEUT3|So according to the Wall Street Journal, the Auto systems company Hawley's going public, it's going to be worth about $1.55 billion.
NEUT4|SPAC merger.
NEUT5|And if you're interested in this company, you're going to want to look for the ticker symbol EM, as in Mary P. As in Paul W. That's EMP W that's empowered limited.
NEUT6|Currently the shares are selling at about $10.
NEUT7|So a little bit about this company there in aftermarket auto system seller.
NEUT8|So everything aftermarket.
NEUT9|That's kind of their niche now.
NEUT10|Want to play video.
NEUT11|This is actually from Hawley.
NEUT12|I'll leave a link in the description below and this is one of their going to show one of your one of their Pro Dash systems so they have this external Pro dash board and it basically has all the configurations of your vehicle.
NEUT13|So one of the Tom Tomlinson he's the CEO of the company.
NEUT14|He said that this company is actually.
NEUT15|It's a very much of a passion driven business.
NEUT16|So they basically make and sell parts, but you know, including fuel injection systems, carburetors, engine products and so they do basically the market to car and truck enthusiasts and they have also exhaust systems for high performance vehicles.
NEUT17|This company is actually been around for over 115 years and in 2020 they had sales of about $580 million.
BULL18|That's actually up 25% from 2019.
NEUT19|Now what I find interesting is that this is one of the only companies that has that is going public on the stock market via SPAC.
NEUT20|That is not one of these new age tech companies or space or one of these green companies.
NEUT21|You know Holly's been around for over 15 years so maybe this is the trend.
NEUT22|May be a lot of older companies are going to start merging through a special Purpose Acquisition Corporation instead of the traditional IPO.
NEUT23|Anyways guys, that's going to be for today.
NEUT24|Let me know what you guys think.
NEUT25|I consider this kind of like the fast and furious company.
NEUT26|Because it just reminds me of people who are really into just swooping up their vehicles.
NEUT27|I don't know how the market this market is going to trend with the electric vehicles kind of surging, but there may be a whole new generation of fast and Furious cars that are electric.
