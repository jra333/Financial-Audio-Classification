NEUT5|In the later stages in going into August at random is 60 bucks.
NEUT6|Been very quiet ever since then but but boom this morning woke up had a really strange activity talking about the government loan stuff so if we go here to the daily chart again this is highlighting that $60.00 foam Oak.
BEAR7|Absolutely ridiculous movement that we've seen previously a couple of months ago and then it's been very quiet ever since then.
NEUT8|Now again, closing on Friday, around $7.53 now, being gangbusters in breaking up to all time levels of breaking out.
