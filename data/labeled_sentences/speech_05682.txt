NEUT0|"""Alright, and actually say the one last question at just about this before we move to GameStop value did tweet that you saw teeth might well and I'm quoting here."
NEUT1|Might well go to $20,000 this cycle.
NEUT2|Are you still standing by that?
NEUT3|It's all I did magic.
NEUT4|I took the child from a million wallets and a million wallets in Bitcoin and where did it go?
NEUT5|It went to 20,000 sunlight.
BULL6|OK, there's a good enough guest.
NEUT7|That was it.
NEUT8|Not hit that irrelevant what it means.
NEUT9|What I'm really trying to say in something like that is it's much larger than you think.
NEUT10|And we've got some idea of an event that played out in the past and looks very like this.
NEUT11|And you know, people like me love a bit of a historical chart, hadn't even though I said this whole new space.
NEUT12|Exciting.
NEUT13|But when you've got something that's so highly correlated, it's OK.
NEUT14|This is interesting.
NEUT15|That sounds sensible target and I know it sounds nonsensical to many, because nobody can think and exponential terms we're just incapable as humans to think.
NEUT16|I just spoke to us instead of spectrum or Mark Usko earlier, he said, and he had a great.
NEUT17|And again, I don't know if he's masses bed right, but just take it as roughly.
NEUT18|He said I can walk 20 paces and go across my office.
NEUT19|Linear paces if I take 20 exponential pace, I go around the world three times.
NEUT20|That's why we cannot think in exponential terms.
NEUT21|It's hilarious, he just can't do it 'cause we don't think that yeah, that way like that.
BULL22|That's a great quote.
NEUT23|And it's only the most maths is right or not, I don't know.
NEUT24|Maybe I'll try to find somebody to Fact Check that.
NEUT25|Yeah exactly.
BULL26|I'm sure we can find some.
NEUT27|That's like, that's like a Jeff Booth thing where he always points out that if you fold a paper 50 times, you know if you ask people how big you think it is, and people say I don't know like 3 feet and you're like no, it's to the sun like it's an after like fold 37 like you're already to the moon.
NEUT28|Like it's the math gets silly once you get out far enough.
NEUT29|Yeah?
NEUT30|Well, OK so Lynn what would be your price prediction for if by end of year?
NEUT31|I don't have a strong opinion on that, but you know, I I think that 'cause the concern is if you if you were watching in 2017, you gave a price prediction on any of them in early 2017, they probably would have all undershot.
NEUT32|What happened in 2017 and so.
NEUT33|But I do.
NEUT34|I think Rouse approach or just kind of looking at at historical hat price and see what happens.
NEUT35|I think makes sense and it's part of the reason why I got so bullish on Bitcoin about a year ago is 'cause I said look every time there's a having this happens and so I'd rather take the bet.
NEUT36|As as a you know, a certain allocation because you know I don't have a specific price target, it's almost like you're embarrassed to say what you think the actual price target is like.
NEUT37|You know it's if it's sitting there like 7000.
NEUT38|You want to be like I think I might go to 100,000, you know.
NEUT39|But like as it was like.
NEUT40|So even then, when I'm kind of made my Bitcoin argument, I didn't give a price target other than I thought it's it's well North of here and I kind of gave like a really big range of outcomes that starts at like 30,000 and it goes up from there.
NEUT41|And so I kind of you, a theorem the same way where.
NEUT42|If if this is a good year for Bitcoin, I would expect Ethereum to also have a very good year and you know, in all likelihood probably outperform during the bull market of that Phase I wouldn't be surprised, and so I don't really know where the the the end of the year looks like.
NEUT43|I just think it's probably North of here by, you know.
NEUT44|Probably a notable amount.
NEUT45|If I were to guess, OK, I've used exactly this the same way we look again.
NEUT46|None of us know exponential assets are really hard.
NEUT47|Not any of us.
NEUT48|Not a single person.
NEUT49|Earth would have guessed how big Amazon got or its share price.
NEUT50|None of us would, right?
NEUT51|So we're going to undershoot some years and we're going to wildly overshoot other years trying to figure this stuff out.
NEUT52|"And again, who knows, all right?"""
