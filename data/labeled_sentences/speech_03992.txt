NEUT0|"""Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett joining us just after writing his annual letter to shareholders and Warren."
NEUT1|This is a big deal.
NEUT2|It's something that the investment community kind of waits on and sees as a must read because you spend so much time actually writing that yourself too much, you start writing the letter.
NEUT3|Well, this when I started very early or very early because I had one section in mind.
NEUT4|It turned out to be the last section, but when I when I talk about the American tail window, I probably wrote that in.
NEUT5|Late summer and and then I work around different sections, but it takes a long time.
NEUT6|Yeah, I'm not a first draft right writer?
NEUT7|Well, for people who have been reading this for a long time, this letter was markedly different than you've written for the past three decades or so, because at the top the opening of every letter in the past to this point has been Berkshires percentage change in book value as the measure that you thought was most important.
NEUT8|This time you kind of stripped it out and said it's not the most important metric anymore for a couple of reasons.
NEUT9|One is which.
NEUT10|Berkshire is changed so markedly, but also you just think it's it's not going to be the way that you'll be measuring things in the future, so it's it's.
NEUT11|It's not the more relevant figure.
NEUT12|At least overtime, not in any one year.
NEUT13|But basically it's market value because we have become.
BULL14|Overwhelmingly, an operating company and we hope to become even more so than a company that really held a lot of stocks and bonds.
NEUT15|So I've actually talked about that in previous reports.
NEUT16|I wouldn't have wanted to quit in a year where I got clobbered by the one I was dropping.
NEUT17|It was adopting one that made me look good.
BULL18|So so I actually included in both in and it was a good year to to make the transition.
NEUT19|And as you said, it's different it.
NEUT20|I've always had the image that I am.
NEUT21|Talking to my sisters, I have two sisters.
NEUT22|They're both Berkshires, pretty much their whole investment.
NEUT23|They're smart, they're not.
NEUT24|Active in business, so they're not reading about it every day, but I pretend they've been away for a year and I'm reporting to them on their investment.
NEUT25|And then this year, because we may be repurchasing.
NEUT26|Shares I I tried to have the vision that they were talking to me about whether they should sell their shares and I was explaining to them exactly how I would look at it if I were in their shoes.
NEUT27|So so it's dear, Doris and Birdie at the start, and then I take that off at the end.
NEUT28|But I'm talking to them.
NEUT29|"And I'm trying to talk to him in a manner where if you know, they're probably entirely in Berkshire, and if they were thinking of selling some, here's what I'd want him to know before before they made a decision."""
