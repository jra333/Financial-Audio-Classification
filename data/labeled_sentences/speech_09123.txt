NEUT0|"""Now you know, take a look at Hilton stock were a major shareholder of Hilton Hilton is the Canary in the coal mine."
NEUT1|This is an incredibly well capitalized, amazing, dominant global company that actually doesn't know many hotels.
NEUT2|It just collects royalties down from like 120 to 50.
NEUT3|OK, it's going to zero OK, along with every other hotel company in the world, you know.
BEAR4|Park hotels and resorts stocks down from 33 to 4.
NEUT5|This is a spinoff from Hilton.
BEAR6|Why is it down from 33 to 4?
NEUT7|Because?
BEAR8|Every hotel is going to be shut down in the country.
NEUT9|Everyone hang on just one second.
NEUT10|You say Hilton is going to zero.
NEUT11|I mean, again, I'm a I'm a major shareholder.
NEUT12|What I'm saying is, if we allow this to continue the way we allow it to continue, OK, every hotel company in the world is done OK 'cause no business can survive a period of 18 months without revenue and that's sick with me and that's what happens.
NEUT13|OK, when if you operate the way we're operating now.
NEUT14|OK, now let me give you so that's a very very bearish thought.
BEAR15|OK, and I've been super bearish, but I got bullish.
NEUT16|OK, and the reason why I got bullish and I've been aggressively buying stocks, including Hilton today.
NEUT17|OK, and I've been buying all the way down Hilton restaurant brands Starbucks, you know, walk your way through are the only stocks are not buying or companies were on the board number restricted.
NEUT18|But the reason why is the only answer for the world.
NEUT19|"Is to shut the world for 30 days."""
