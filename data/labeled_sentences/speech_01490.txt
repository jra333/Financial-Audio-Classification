NEUT0|"""What's everybody?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel Stanley talk about Berkshire Hathaway?
NEUT2|Why I think it's bye bye love the stock and where I think it's going to go.
NEUT3|Let's jump right into it.
NEUT4|So start off.
NEUT5|Berkshire Hathaway is a big fund.
NEUT6|They own a lot of shares of a lot of other companies and it's run by Warren Buffett.
NEUT7|And currently this stock for one one share is 300 and $12,000.
NEUT8|Yes, that is correct 312.
NEUT9|That is an insane amount of money and here's why it's worth so.
NEUT10|The reason why Berkshire Hathaway so awesome.
NEUT11|The reason why it keeps coming up is because it's run.
NEUT12|By one man at the head that had a table, and he's really, really smart.
NEUT13|Just Warren Buffett.
NEUT14|Warren Buffett is one of the most successful investors of all time and truly has revolutionized the way that you should think about and invest in the US economy and globally.
NEUT15|Warren Buffett really thinks that the way people feel and respond to brands and then looks at them and then look at the statements to see if they're actually a positive cash flow company.
NEUT16|A lot of people flip that around and try to buy companies that don't actually have a good customer and consumer feeling to it.
NEUT17|And one Buffett truly has a unique gift.
NEUT18|Being able to analyze which businesses are going to decline in which businesses are going to succeed every single quarter quarter after quarter, successfully to be able to produce and actually have Berkshire Hathaway Bradys today to give you an idea of how much better Berkshire Hathaway is then just the regular market.
BULL19|I'm going to give you some numbers, so the regular market the SNP is up almost 19,000% in the past 55 years, which is a crazy game.
BULL20|Absolutely insane game for the SNP, and if you look at that compared to what is not too good, because Berkshire Hathaway stock is up two point 7,000,000% over the past few over the past 55 years at the same time spent.
NEUT21|And that's not an error that's truly insane to think about how Berkshire Hathaway has absolutely blown the US S&P out of the freaking water at a park.
NEUT22|Just that's insane.
NEUT23|Think about how awesome Berkshire can be.
NEUT24|Some other things.
NEUT25|10 Reasons why People love Berkshire Hathaway is because they own a lot of companies that pay dividends to their employees.
NEUT26|If that's Dairy Queen.
NEUT27|If that's Coca Cola.
NEUT28|If that's other companies that they own, maybe GEICO?
NEUT29|They want ton of other companies that pay dividends and those dividends come in and they give those to their shareholders.
NEUT30|So total those dividends rack up to around 4.7 to $5 billion every single year in dividends, which is absolutely insane to think about how much dividends that actually is.
NEUT31|And Warren Buffett tries to buy back and usually does buyback Berkshire with the dividends he gets from Berkshire to prove how good it is.
NEUT32|How strong it is.
BULL33|And that helped increase his stock in network overall.
BULL34|Berk Shire is a great company to get into their own.
NEUT35|A ton of other companies.
NEUT36|Ann Warren Buffett is a true genius.
NEUT37|I am over the world and I'm a little skeptical because Warren Buffett is in his 90s and as we know people don't live forever so there's definitely a risk there and we don't know what Berkshire will look like.
NEUT38|After Warren Buffett's passing in the next coming decades, which is very challenging to say, and it's hard to look at a company differently when they've only had this one solid brain leading them year after year after year.
NEUT39|So that's still up in the air right now.
NEUT40|It's a bye bye.
NEUT41|Still would watch Warren's health, other companies and how he's managing the markets.
BULL42|I hope you guys all have a good one.
NEUT43|Smash the like comment down below.
NEUT44|If you ever bought Berkshire, obviously probably fractional shares, not a full share and what it was like also.
NEUT45|Everybody stay safe out there.
NEUT46|I know it's been crazy few months and just be kind to one another.
NEUT47|Have a good one.
NEUT48|"Peace out."""
