BULL0|"""Alright, so Disney is at $189.04 with a market cap of 343.16 billion, so we're staying steady in this $190.00 to $180.00 range and that's pretty awesome."
NEUT1|So that means I'm up on money.
BULL2|I hope you're up on money and I'm trying to accumulate as much Disney shares as I can before it hits 200.
NEUT3|That's that's my, that's my limit.
NEUT4|Once it passes 200 I'm not buying.
NEUT5|So in today's news, Disneyland California reopens temporarily for special touch of Disney event.
NEUT6|So on Wednesday, Disneyland Resorts announced that starting March 18th, customers can go to Disney California Adventure Park to sample food and beverages from around the park.
NEUT7|An health and safety measures will be in place based on guidance from health authorities such as centers, Disease Control, an other government agencies.
NEUT8|The limited capacity ticketed event will run through April 5th and allows more than 1000 Disney cast members to return to work.
NEUT9|So it goes on to say why does it matter?
BEAR10|Disneyland Resort which which Disney California Adventure Park is part of has been closed since March 16th, 2020, when the Covid pandemic first took place in the US.
BULL11|So Disney has been very vocal to California that they.
BULL12|Are not happy that they can't reopen, but California keeps restricting them and I think they struck a deal to where they can show.
NEUT13|Hey, they can do it safely.
NEUT14|We need to start earning money and I bet you how this happened is somebody probably said hey.
NEUT15|We're going to pack up and leave and maybe had to taxes because look at their businesses, their open, they've got nice weather down there.
NEUT16|Well, not right now, but overall this is.
NEUT17|This is interesting.
BULL18|This is good.
BEAR19|I think Disney is going to strong arm California to allowing them to reopen because they're losing out on billions and billions of dollars and it's hurting their business.
NEUT20|So this is good to see.
BULL21|I'm interested to see what happens on this afterwards, and I think we're going to see Disneyland reopen very, very soon, and that would be awesome for all shareholders.
NEUT22|So stay on top of this, do your own research, have some fun, make some money.
