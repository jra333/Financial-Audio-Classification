NEUT0|"""Jim, it sort of reminds me of what Diamond said about going back to work and and the need for office space as Bloomberg this morning reports that JP Morgan is trying to sublease about 700,000 square feet in the financial District and Hudson Yards."
NEUT1|I think diamonds quote essentially was look if you have 100 employees, you're not going to need 100 desks.
NEUT2|You're going to need like 60.
BEAR3|Yeah, well this is the problem with the largest tower in San Francisco, Salesforce.
NEUT4|Nobody is there other than Mark when he.
NEUT5|Announced the quarter.
NEUT6|I mean there people lot of people don't really want to go back.
NEUT7|A lot of people turned out to be, I'd say, inexpensive to keep that home.
NEUT8|David, you know when you keep someone at home, you need that you can close the cafeteria an you can have them have Campbell soup.
NEUT9|Yep, chunky.
NEUT10|I think I've got a lot of that in the closet here that to your right, my boy put all this stuff that I'm never going.
NEUT11|I mean honestly.
NEUT12|I mean, I'm crazy.
NEUT13|Well we we we did that guys, you know.
NEUT14|Just before we quickly move on here on this subject though of remote and flexible.
NEUT15|Working again back to this series.
NEUT16|I've been doing this like yesterday to a model ecoh Dirk van de put will have that up for people fairly soon.
NEUT17|It's here to stay, you know.
NEUT18|He was talking about the fact that they're just going to have.
NEUT19|More employees with so-called flexibel plants in terms of working from home or working in the office, and it doesn't appear that we're ever going to go back to the levels, at least at this point, based on all the conversations I've had with these CEOs when asking that question that we saw in terms of people in the office in 2019.
NEUT20|What that means for commercial real estate.
NEUT21|Unclear, but one would imagine not particularly good.
NEUT22|But that's Jim.
NEUT23|That's just a trend that's that's that's going to stay.
NEUT24|Not that.
NEUT25|Of course people are going to go back, but you're not going to again 60%.
NEUT26|Maybe that's the number 7080%, you know, he's bought this chocolate company HQ that I like very much.
NEUT27|Obviously he's got the Tates cookies.
NEUT28|I mean, his lineup of snacks fits right in Qual model.
NEUT29|ES is a company that is fabulous.
NEUT30|If we're staying home.
BULL31|Wow, their cookies are good.
NEUT32|He's got Dirk please stop sending us the stuff you're killing me.
BEAR33|I mean, I mean, you're killing me.
BEAR34|I'm putting on too much weight since you he sends you stuff.
NEUT35|We sent him big thing it takes Malamar's man said that those are seasonal seasonal Mars.
NEUT36|Those are seasonal yet still cold.
NEUT37|It's so cold.
NEUT38|I'm looking at snow.
NEUT39|Well, that's 'cause you're not at the office.
NEUT40|You don't get no if you're not into office.
BULL41|The cafeteria has true.
NEUT42|Yeah, beyond that well.
BULL43|Well, I was going to say to the degree that we start going to the office, I don't know if you saw lift best ride demand for that company since the pandemic began shares I think are closing in not far from a two year high going back to August I think of 19 gas demand.
NEUT44|Last week Jim was the highest since the pandemic began and then Starbucks yesterday with some announcements about bringing oatly oat milk and nationwide some new vegan options like an avocado protein box.
NEUT45|So menu innovation is going to try to keep up with.
NEUT46|They return of demand that you've been talking about.
BULL47|Starbucks stocks been amazing in the last few weeks.
NEUT48|It's become a play on America opening.
NEUT49|I love Kevin Johnson.
NEUT50|I think it's really much more a play on throughput, but you know what?
BEAR51|A lot of coffee, a lot of coffee shops went out of business of the 150,000 stores went out of business.
NEUT52|Alot of them are coffee shops, so Starbucks Reigns Supreme Court.
