BEAR0|"""Even after the recent decline, Broden points out that goal remains in a longer term uptrend."
NEUT1|That is pretty beautiful.
NEUT2|I have to tell you that's what is that called.
NEUT3|That's a pattern of higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT4|Notice he doesn't take out that last low.
NEUT5|It's exactly what you want to charge.
NEUT6|More importantly, when she looks at past, the clients going back to 2013, she sees this pattern.
NEUT7|It's what's known as symmetry.
NEUT8|That's what she looks for.
BEAR9|Many of these declines have been very similar in size.
BEAR10|Taking gold down from 230-5262 when broaden ran 100% projections of these previous wings.
NEUT11|They suggested that the precious metal could find a bottom somewhere between.
NEUT12|1827 and 1853.
NEUT13|Well, sure enough, that's about where gold is repeatedly found.
BULL14|A floor of support over the last couple of months.
NEUT15|It's pretty incredible right now it's over $1900, right?
BULL16|That's up roughly 50 bucks from September last.
BULL17|As long as cold holds above that level, Brody believes the long term uptrend remains intact, meaning it can resume its long March higher.
NEUT18|How much higher look?
NEUT19|Based on Fibonacci methodology thinks she's going to take out 2153?
NEUT20|That's roughly 13% from this, where the Chinese stuff is currently trading.
NEUT21|I want that money.
BULL22|Hope you do too.
BULL23|Again, that's only works if gold holds above the mid 1800s, which I think it will, that's it, Rd is pretty confident that gold is already bottomed because of what she sees in the daily chart.
NEUT24|So let's take a look at the daily chart.
NEUT25|That was the weekly.
NEUT26|So we go to the deli.
BEAR27|And we're going to see is last week the precious metal it pulled back and retested the September lows.
NEUT28|OK, so I mean that's, you know we saw that this very quick pull back of the Lowe's held and now golds bouncing around again.
NEUT29|More importantly, you've got gold.
NEUT30|Remember how Britain operates?
NEUT31|She looks at past swings in a given security.
NEUT32|Then she runs them through that rubric of Fibonacci ratios, a series of numbers that repeat over and over again in nature.
NEUT33|That Flowers, pine cone snail shells, the result Fibonacci Queen gets a series of critical prices.
NEUT34|Are critical dates where Stalker body or an index is likely to change the trajectory for goal broaden?
BEAR35|Saw cluster of Fibonacci time cycles that predicted important low in October.
NEUT36|This is important low October 29th, 30th.
NEUT37|Sure enough, the actual location on 29th so there's a good chance that that was the turning point.
BULL38|She's been so spot on this.
NEUT39|That's why we're spending time on it now.
NEUT40|What would make you even more bullish?
NEUT41|OK Bro, wants to see gold.
NEUT42|Take out some key resistance levels.
NEUT43|There's one up.
NEUT44|If you push here at 1910, it's kind of interesting level.
NEUT45|Another one.
BEAR46|These are very tight here.
NEUT47|1919 Nineteen 22 crew.
NEUT48|These two rolls, along with the October Hiatt, 1939.
NEUT49|If she gets beyond those, I mean it's going to be really smooth sailing.
NEUT50|As long as the precious metal hangs in above the mid 1800s called her a buyer, I think she's going to be dead, right?
NEUT51|You know how much I like gold here now.
NEUT52|Here's the bottom line.
NEUT53|The charts is interpreted by Carolyn broaden.
NEUT54|Suggest that gold prices could have a lot more room to run OK?
NEUT55|And that currently fits with the current backdrop that we see in the news.
NEUT56|So if you don't already own some, perhaps it's time right now.
