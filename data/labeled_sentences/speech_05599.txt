NEUT0|"""Guess the question is, is Tech really going to lose dollars of the pie?"
NEUT1|Which seems unlikely.
BULL2|People think Roku is even going to benefit from this shift to kind of on line based on where the eyeballs are.
NEUT3|Is Amazon going to pick up ad money that Facebook and Facebook and Google might be losing out on right now?
NEUT4|I think they're going to share that add money.
BULL5|Certainly it's going to be reconfigured and adjusted as we move forward, but Amazon is the darling up nearly 30% year to date.
NEUT6|My thumb Kelly.
NEUT7|It's sore from pressing my Amazon app, 'cause we've been used as so much as we're confined here in Chicago, but I do think Amazon gives us a lot of information, but look at Microsoft too.
NEUT8|That's not forget about Microsoft next week on Wednesday, and I know Facebook just came out talking about competing with the video conferencing.
NEUT9|Microsoft has team, so all these can't share the market.
NEUT10|But Facebook.
NEUT11|That statement we just saw.
NEUT12|Is really interesting from Courtney, because now if you look at Facebook in the Messenger potential right there 10 times the size of zoom, I know people get excited about zoom.
NEUT13|I'm on zoom right now.
BULL14|This is super exciting, but at the end of the day, Kelly, we're going to see a lot of focus on this tech sector, and I think you still need exposure.
NEUT15|If it's XL K, you have to own these individual names or the broader swath ETF.
NEUT16|Alright, Jeff Kilburg always boiling it down for us.
BULL17|"Thank you Sir."""
