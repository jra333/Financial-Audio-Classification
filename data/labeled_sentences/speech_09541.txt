BEAR0|"""He did also want to ask you about Tesla because that sack also off just around 2% today."
BEAR1|Bears are pointing to the miss that they reported an earnings about that they reported lower margins.
NEUT2|Why doesn't this worry you at all?
BULL3|It's a Golden age for EB's, and I know we've talked about it before, but it's 3% penetration in terms of EV's globally going to 10% next three to four years, China firing on all cylinders, and I think you're seeing not just for Tessa but the likes of Neo X Ping and others.
BEAR4|And then when you look at a by the ministration coming in, I think a doubling down on tax credit restoration to Tesla and GM.
NEUT5|This is really just the start of what I believe could be a million vehicles plus delivered for tests in 2022.
NEUT6|They're going to be conservative at the gate for deliveries, but I think it's a sandbag special in terms of guidance.
NEUT7|What about this effort by the federal government to switch over to the fleet?
NEUT8|All new purchases?
NEUT9|Being electric vehicles?
NEUT10|I mean, are we going to see remember how it was K cars in the 1980s?
NEUT11|Or we're going to see Nissan Leafs?
NEUT12|'cause I can't imagine government folk driving Teslas.
NEUT13|Well, I think when you look at this government initiative, it's really the broader green in this ship that we're seeing.
NEUT14|Of course, GM just dove into the deep end of the pool, going fully bees by 2035, and I think what you're really going to see is a massive shift within the US, not just on the government side but but within consumer demand.
NEUT15|But a lot of it's driven from abandoning the Blue Senate green across the board, and that disproportionately benefits the likes of Tesla, GM.
NEUT16|But it's also why you have that company.
NEUT17|In Cupertino Apple, they're not going to look at TV's from the outside looking in.
BULL18|I believe in that six nine months they announced Navy partnership with the likes of Tesla, VW, Hyundai or potential.
NEUT19|One of the big three.
NEUT20|Hey Dan, we got the info out from Biden saying that he wants to move this whole the fleet to ivis this whole initiative that he wants.
NEUT21|He didn't give a timeline, does that matter?
NEUT22|Well, I think they don't want to put themselves sort of back against the wall in terms of the time frame that we took out 2030 in terms of Supercharger network potentially building at 500 K But I think they still need to double click and figure out to make sure that they do a time rise and they don't miss.
NEUT23|There'll be a lot of speculation on that and I I think over the next call it three to six months.
BULL24|It's gonna be more concrete plan but I think it's gonna be multifaceted.
BULL25|The restoration of tax credits of Tesla and GM that significant especially for Tesla.
BULL26|Terms of US demand more tax incentives in terms of factory build out in the supercharger build outs, and I believe a year from now we're sitting here.
BULL27|We have more far and EV manufacturers coming into this country, and I think that's going to be a big part of job growth in terms of the EV environment.
NEUT28|Dan, before I let you go, I gotta ask him, hold you to something you said earlier in the discussion.
NEUT29|Are you Kansas City fan?
NEUT30|Or I mean, ultimately I like Kansas City, but my homes in my opinion, it's hard to bet against him just like it's hard to bet against Tesla and Apple.
NEUT31|And you know, I still I think Casey by a touchdown.
NEUT32|Alright Dan Ives, we gotta get you back on the 8th.
NEUT33|But first I'm going to say thank you.
BULL34|It is always a pleasure to have you here buddy.
NEUT35|All the best to you.
NEUT36|Take care Dan.
NEUT37|"I was with Wedbush Securities."""
