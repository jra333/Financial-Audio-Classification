NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
BEAR1|Traders Greenwood stocks come at you today.
NEUT2|Wanna talk about quality catalysts and as you see, I tweeted about hurts and the quality catalyst it had on October 16th when it made the run so real quick.
NEUT3|What is the headline?
BEAR4|Say hurt stocks more than doubles after securing 1.7 billion in financing?
NEUT5|What does that mean?
NEUT6|That means that they're giving them 100.
NEUT7|They're giving them $1.7 billion.
NEUT8|To continue their corporate operations and to pay off their debt.
NEUT9|Now I checked the first thing you have to do is see how much the company is worth, you know, and when you go and you look at how much the company is worth.
NEUT10|Then you can get a gauge on you know exactly what this what these figures mean.
NEUT11|So right now we're looking at the open.
NEUT12|179 The market cap is 282 SO $282 million is what this company is worth before before it made the move that was worth worth about $100 million.
NEUT13|So 1.7 billion versus 100,000,000.
NEUT14|That's about 10 times the net worth of the company.
BULL15|So we're going to go and we're going to look OK, so my entry that I made I got.

NEUT26|So I got in at 138 runs up to two 2086 but because it didn't consolidate OK Now we're talking about trading Now the catalyst before it consolidates it spikes.
BEAR27|That means it's going to pull back really hard now.
NEUT28|This stock will rent went sideways when it opened.
NEUT29|Totally different story.
NEUT30|Could have made another run so because it spikes so so hard we had to wait for a new hire.
