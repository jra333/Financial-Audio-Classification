NEUT0|"""It's going this way."
NEUT1|Video chart on ticker symbol FCEL.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well, another day an higher highs and higher lows as it continues to recover from this pretty crazy movement.
NEUT6|When the price was all the way down there.
BULL7|And like I said from there just continue to recover with some new highs today.
BEAR8|New lows.
NEUT9|So more of the story updates definitely need to be made so one of the newest areas of support what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT10|We say you know what?
NEUT11|Make this chart look the absolute best.
NEUT12|Going forward.
NEUT13|That would be if the price can now stay up there above $18.00.
BEAR14|Now with that being said, don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 18, that does not mean that the entire charts now epically destroyed or anything like that.
BULL15|But yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL16|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT17|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT18|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT21|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move.
NEUT22|That right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT23|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT24|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT25|Her best visualize that that is what is being presented against an above 18 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT26|Let's squeeze down the charter a little bit.
NEUT27|Even probably more to bring up a bit more context there we go next key overarching area resistance.
NEUT28|In my opinion, at least right up there around $19.50.
NEUT29|So we'll keep a close eye on that and see if the price can work its way up there and then break up through it.
NEUT30|But at the end of the day, what matters most is what the price has been doing and continues to do.
NEUT31|And that's all about just building those higher bases.
NEUT32|So as long as that continues to happen, that means the Bulls are in control.
NEUT33|So let's see how this week continues to play out.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL37|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT42|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
