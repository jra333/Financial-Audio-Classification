BULL0|"""Long story short, save Frogs businesses a lot going forward."
NEUT1|I think this is a great story, but and this is one of those big butts Sir.
NEUT2|Mix alot but this stocks giving me Vertigo.
NEUT3|Jay frogs.
NEUT4|Valuation is already in Nosebleed territory when the company initially filed its IPO paperwork last month they floated an initial public break price range of 33 to 37.
BULL5|Earlier this week they raised the range from 39 to 41.
NEUT6|Then this morning the deal priced above that at 44.
NEUT7|At those levels it was a $4 billion company when J Frog open for trading at 12:30.
BEAR8|It it already soared to $71.27, which made it $6.5 billion company and will close down a few points.
BULL9|From these levels, it's far from cheaper.
NEUT10|Keep in mind late last year they were considering an IPO with just a $1.5 billion valuation later this year at the IPO Price, J Frog was already trading 25 times are rough 2020 sales estimate at the opening price that was sent from within 40 times sales that puts it towards the high end of the cloud based software stocks.
NEUT11|Yes, it's got zoom like valuation but does not have zoom like growth.
BULL12|Now this morning I said I'd be willing to pay up to 50 times sales for.
NEUT13|The other big IPO today Snowflake even that felt ridiculous to say, but snowflakes kind of triple ludicrous triple digit growth rate and it quickly started trading at more than 100 times sales which I tell you it doesn't often work out J frogs, only growing at a 50% clip.
BULL14|So you can't pay as much for that even as the company is much closer profitability then its IPO birthday.
BULL15|Buddy Jay frogs growth is more in line with that of something like Encino.
NEUT16|Remember an capital.
NEUT17|See, I know the financial services played it came public in July at by like this one and see no trades about 35 times sales.
NEUT18|Then they were on not that long ago.
NEUT19|I said this is a company that's hard to be good mode to bless J Frog at the same level.
BEAR20|Put it around 60 down nearly 5 bucks here.
NEUT21|Still a tad too expensive.
NEUT22|You know where I really feel comfortable.
NEUT23|This don't laugh in the high 40s is where you want to buy this one.
BEAR24|That's down about 15 points from where it went out.
NEUT25|That's where I would put it in the bullpen.
NEUT26|Bottom line.
NEUT27|Jay frogs, another terrific company with a stock that's simply too hot to handle right now.
NEUT28|It says lean so you know what we get sell offs.
BEAR29|Don't forget zoom fell from 4:50 to 3:50 in a blink of an eye we get.
NEUT30|Sell offs and when we do maybe you can get the stock at a much less exorbitant price.
NEUT31|Bye bye bye.
