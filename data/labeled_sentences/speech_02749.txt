BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|We're going to do some technical analysis for EGLD, which is L Ron against ever US based on finance prices.
NEUT2|Alright, so this is an update video just from a video I did a couple of days back on this one.
NEUT3|Obviously we've been talking about it since the break out of this wedge around like 1:35 to 1:45.
NEUT4|You know, e.g LD broke 160 with some volume gave like a 20% a little bit less than 20% pop from there.
NEUT5|This was kind of the big spot to watch on like 158 to 160, so after that broke.
NEUT6|You know we had this long upper wake.
BULL7|Typically not the best candle, but we had talked about saying that we wanted to see with some consolidation above this prior resistance level.
NEUT8|Now turn support.
NEUT9|So as you can see, like for example you have a big pop here, some sideways big pop.
BULL10|Now we're getting some sideways action over this prior resistance level.
NEUT11|So this is kind of now the new support level.
NEUT12|I mean pretty much you just want to see like 158 to 160 somewhere in that range held on the daily before we get.
BULL13|Another leg up.
BEAR14|I think the big spot to watch at this point is some volume to come in through 170, so this one can break about $170 on volume.
BULL15|Better than this kind of similar to this prior breakout spot.
BULL16|That'll set this one for another leg up break of 187 would probably like would realistically send this one back to $200.
BULL17|Plus, in my opinion, this chart has a really good look to it.
NEUT18|A really good risk to reward because if your risk is like down to one 56155 ish that's less than 10% with the reward.
NEUT19|Potentially of $200.
NEUT20|Plus at this point.
NEUT21|So just looking at this one to me.
NEUT22|You know, this one is setting up extremely nicely.
NEUT23|It's going to be interesting to see how this plays out with the Daily Candle.
NEUT24|You know closing very shortly.
NEUT25|It'll be interesting to see if some volume can come in, or if this one is really just going to keep going sideways for a little bit longer, but ultimately that's what I'm watching.
NEUT26|I don't wanna waste anymore of you guys this time.
NEUT27|This one is pretty straightforward.
NEUT28|Breaker 170 ish on volume, then a break of like 187 and then this one retest highs.
NEUT29|If it starts to break down and come back into this range, I'm not super interested into it.
BEAR30|If it loses like that 158 to 160, we're looking at like 150 as the next level of support below that, and I'm definitely not interested personally.
