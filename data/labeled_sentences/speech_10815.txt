BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking about Mara and the news we just got as it seems to be affecting the stock price.
NEUT2|But stick around and I'll go through the news we got as well as where I see this going.
NEUT3|Alright, so before we get into it, there will be a link in the description to the discord.
NEUT4|If you're interested in joining, I'm on there a lot of the time and we talk stocks and I'm there to answer you guys questions.
BULL5|So looking at more on the day, we were doing pretty well.
BEAR6|We were up over 11% for the day, but then came after hours which we were down 10% in after hours at the time of this recording to just under $24.00 a share.
NEUT7|So, so here's some of the news that we got.
NEUT8|So this first bit of news are here was actually from a day or two ago, but it's still kind of relevant to this, so we learn that the CEO of Mars sold 600 and 32,000 shares at $20.51 a share, which equals out to about $13 million.
NEUT9|So the new news we got on Mara is from this article right here.
NEUT10|The articles titled Marathon Patent Group Files for mixed shelving offering up to $300 million.
NEUT11|So what is the mix shell Warframe and what does this mean for the stock?
NEUT12|Now?
NEUT13|What I'm mixed shelf offering is it allows the company to register a new issue with the SEC that allows up to three years for the share offering rather than selling it all at once.
NEUT14|So what this essentially does is it gives the company three years to sell all the shares instead of doing a share offering all at once, which this is beneficial to them, because then they can share, or they can sell the shares.
BEAR15|And when the prices are higher throughout this time period, so is this going to be really bad for Mara or not so much.
NEUT16|Personally I don't think it's that big of a deal.
BULL17|I do think we'll see a bit of a dip, but I'm expecting this dip to get bought out pretty quickly.
NEUT18|I'm just treating this as a sale price because nothing really changed fundamentally and I still have seen the stock being really big over the course of the year.
NEUT19|So anyways, that's it for the video.
BEAR20|I just wanted to provide a quick update on the news that we got as to why the share price was dipping and some people are having trouble finding the article.
NEUT21|So I just want to share what do you guys think?
NEUT22|What do you think about the news?
NEUT23|Where do you think the price is going to go?
NEUT24|Let me know down below.
NEUT25|"But remember, this video isn't financial advice, it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
