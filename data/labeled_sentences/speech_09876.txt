NEUT0|"""Hello YouTube, welcome back to the channel today and today we're gonna be talking bout Golden Nugget Online gaming AKA GN OGI stock."
BULL1|Gino G Stock had recently ran up today all the way up to $19.18 an I gave you guys my resistance last time of 1911 and we did.
NEUT2|Kind of you know we go above that but we didn't resist in 1918 so therefore I'm going to actually talk a little bit about why Golden Nugget Online gaming had ran up and why it is kind of falling right now.
NEUT3|We do have support at $16.77 and also $15.53.
NEUT4|And I'm going to give you guys an update a little bit on Golden Nugget Online gaming as well.
NEUT5|And some news that have come out 4G energy stock that is going to cause it to skyrocket as long as they keep doing what they're doing.
NEUT6|And if you all do like a stop contagious, make sure you leave me like, subscribe only around 5% of you guys that are actually watching or actually subscribe to my channel so you can hit the notification Bell so you keep up to date with all the latest hot stocks that I do post.
NEUT7|So as of right now go to Nugget, online gaming, AKG and OGI stock has a market cap of 1.192 billion and the next earnings report is going to be on June 2nd.
BULL8|They actually beat their earnings last time around, which was just recently happened.
NEUT9|It happened around March 3rd, 2021, around 13 days ago.
BEAR10|As you guys can see here, we had a big downfall going up in the earnings we bounced off of around $12.50 and we've been on the run up ever since from 12:50 all the way up to the high of 1911.
NEUT11|This talk has seen $27.18 before and that was whenever it back in the day whenever the LCA become Gino G in the merge happened.
NEUT12|As of today, Gold Nugget online gaming had announced that it had one one of the few converted online gaming license.
NEUT13|To be awarded in Virginia has been granted temporary permit to online sports wagering in the state of Virginia.
BULL14|The company now has market access to 10 states, legislation and regulatory approval permitting.
BULL15|So that's something that is going to be good for G and OG as it is getting more and more states involved and we can actually get Golden Nugget online gaming revenue out there even further.
NEUT16|So go nugget online.
BULL17|Gaming is a leading online gaming company that is considered a market leader by its peers and was first to bring live dealer and live casino floor to United States online gambling market.
BULL18|Golden Nugget Online Gang was the past recipient 15-A Gaming Review North America Awards including the operator of the Year Award in 2017, 2018-2019, 2020.
NEUT19|So it is four years in a row so I believe that is what is causing the movement to go to nugget online gaming.
NEUT20|'cause Golden nugget online gaming is going to need to try to get every state 'cause that will just bring more revenue to them and their online casinos as it has got state of Virginia.
NEUT21|It is going to be the 10th state that is allowed to do with the online casino gambling for Golden Nugget Online gaming and giving them their permit.
BULL22|So Gino G is going to be a great long term potential as it is starting to grow more and more states.
NEUT23|Online gambling is becoming more of a virtual thing other than going actually into a casino now and gambling.
NEUT24|You can do virtually at any time that you please.
NEUT25|So I think Gino G is going to be one step ahead of a lot of these other casinos that are kind of behind.
NEUT26|Gino G and Draft Kings Stock is a lot similar because as you guys can see here once draft Kings and go to Nugget Online gaming both.
NEUT27|They were both packs.
NEUT28|And whenever they actually both came to the floor, they were trying to do the same thing they were trying to grow and grow and grow as I do think.
BULL29|Golden Nugget Online Gaming does have the potential to go back up to around the 25 to $30 mark in the short term.
NEUT30|I believe that is going to happen more than likely before the end of 2021, as I do think in my long term prosperity for Golden Nugget online gaming.
BULL31|If they do stay in the same tax bracket revenue and they're going to beat year over year and month over month revenues, we can see Golden Nugget online gaming easily going up to around the 40 to the $50 mark before the end of 2022.
