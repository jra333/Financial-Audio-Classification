BEAR0|"""And Bitcoin over the last week has a $13 billion market cap."
NEUT1|That's more than US Steel, and that's bigger than Twitter.
NEUT2|So what's going on?
NEUT3|There's a couple.
NEUT4|Just fundamental things going on.
NEUT5|The first thing is just classic supply and demand, so we have demand coming from China and India.
NEUT6|We talked about the devaluations that are occurring in China Capital Flight.
NEUT7|Coming from China, almost $50 billion last month.
NEUT8|People are using Bitcoin as a digital gold and store of value in an environment like that in India.
NEUT9|A month ago they in 20 minutes said.
BEAR10|86% of the cash in the country is no longer valid, so they essentially demonetized the country.
NEUT11|People then look for an alternative currency that is outside of the financial system.
BEAR12|Bitcoin got demand from that at the same time you have supply declining, so we only have 5,000,000 Bitcoin that are left is going to be 21 million total.
NEUT13|16 million are free floating the other 5,000,000 are going to be drip fed out to the market over the next 100 years so you don't have anything like in gold with the price goes up.
BULL14|And you have a supply response from the miners.
NEUT15|In Bitcoin that's not going to happen.
NEUT16|There's 5,000,000 left, so you have increasing demand smashing right in to decreasing supply.
NEUT17|And what do you get when you get a smart board that doesn't work but the other thing you get is you got a Chinese one highly correlated to Bitcoin.
NEUT18|OK, that's been happening over the last month or so and then the second.
NEUT19|Here we go.
NEUT20|That's the chart right there.
NEUT21|Look at that.
NEUT22|This has been for almost a year, and if you actually look at what Bitcoin does, it tends to move.
NEUT23|A week or two ahead of the one, so you can kind of get an idea of where that rates going to be, and then finally you might ask PK.
NEUT24|Is it too late to buy?
NEUT25|Bitcoin became populated by Bitcoin?
NEUT26|Yeah, you know like they can so much for asking that it's not too late to buy Bitcoin, and here's why.
BULL27|It's up 100% this year.
NEUT28|Phenomenal run, but this chart is a log chart which adjusts for big price changes.
NEUT29|Essentially percentage change.
NEUT30|So this is Bitcoin all the way back from 2002.
NEUT31|Massive rally and you can see on a log chart.
BEAR32|We've really just been going sideways here for a bit.
BULL33|"So if we really get this acceleration and we get some more use cases coming on in the next year, you could really see a massive breakout in this."""
