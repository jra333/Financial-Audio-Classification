NEUT0|"""We have one last request here."
NEUT1|Somebody wants to look at flow OK, so let's do that.
NEUT2|Let's take a look at flow.
NEUT3|Thank you.
NEUT4|Learn whether Zell not sure.
NEUT5|If I pronounce that right.
NEUT6|OK, so Flo, let's take a look at flow here.
NEUT7|OK, so we have the low frequency indicator.
NEUT8|OK, so this is still bullish.
NEUT9|What's going on over here and so still bullish on flow if you go to the high frequency.
NEUT10|Strategy.
NEUT11|So this is in the last six months.
BEAR12|OK, so the high frequency one which does a lot more trading has turned bearish.
NEUT13|So from both from 637 all the way until $25.00.
NEUT14|So how should somebody interprets right?
NEUT15|So as first mentioned?
NEUT16|One thing to note, so because this doesn't have as much data, but this accuracy is 100%.
NEUT17|But ideally you would want something that has been or has lots of price action for several years.
NEUT18|That way you can see how it trades over a long term period because flow is a relatively new coin there too much price history and as mentioned this requires three months worth of price history.
NEUT19|But looking at this.
NEUT20|Treat this as a time to take profits if you're still bullish on this.
NEUT21|Maybe don't sell everything, but if you're just trading this and you don't really care about the long term, story is probably a good time to take profits.
NEUT22|An wait until it turns bullish because going back to the example here.
NEUT23|Actually, I think it was.
NEUT24|It was on.
NEUT25|Right, so for example here, right?
NEUT26|So with Ethereum, it was Bush turned bearish, meaning it took profits.
NEUT27|Then it got Bush again, 'cause it looked like it was about a rally.
NEUT28|Then in theory and corrected right, so sometimes it's not perfect, right?
