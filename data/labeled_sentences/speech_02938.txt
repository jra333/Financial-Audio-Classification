NEUT0|"""You know how everyone today?"
NEUT1|I like to talk about Facebook stock?
NEUT2|It has a decent look and set up over here is the daily chart.
BULL3|And as you can see, it was turning up pretty nicely.
NEUT4|Then it took a dip down.
NEUT5|Came up came down and this look like this one.
NEUT6|Try to run up again.
NEUT7|How far?
NEUT8|Who knows?
NEUT9|But over here on the one hour.
NEUT10|You know it came down and it's coming back up.
NEUT11|Then it's on the one hour in the daily chart.
NEUT12|It's above the 9:20 in the 50 MA.
NEUT13|And on the four hour I used to have the Daily 4 hour up.
NEUT14|Always work I looked at.
NEUT15|One out I thought it didn't look too bad.
NEUT16|And now the four hour.
BULL17|I mean it, it was going up.
BULL18|Drop down came up.
NEUT19|Drop down and come up.
NEUT20|In this doesn't happen bad setup for long.
NEUT21|Possession.
NEUT22|Now, this daily chart wasn't sitting Warriors at.
NEUT23|I wouldn't think about it long.
NEUT24|But right now it has a pretty good set up like Friday morning, right here.
BEAR25|You know it went down.
BULL26|Friday afternoon it came back up.
NEUT27|I'm going to say.
NEUT28|Go Facebook long.
NEUT29|Only thing only thing you can hope for is look for.
NEUT30|Is a decent rate set up?
NEUT31|Like over here, you don't really don't want to buy high right here.
NEUT32|Could have continued to go up absolutely, but why take the chance?
NEUT33|Goodbye and low.
BEAR34|This is taking a debt down.
NEUT35|And now it's setting up.
NEUT36|This is a long setup trade for Facebook, so I say go ahead and and log it.
NEUT37|All of my videos would be short and sweet.
NEUT38|Try to keep things real simple.
BULL39|"Peace out people have a good day."""
