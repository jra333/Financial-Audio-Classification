NEUT0|"""As we've been bringing you out, the expectation here is that extra $600 in unemployment aid going to be rolling off at the end of the month, and we still don't necessarily know what Republicans and Democrats might agree to, but that's going to be impacting millions of Americans as well as what we could see come play through in that next round of stimulus and joining us now for more on how we should all be planning around this is Chris Hogan, the author of Everyday Millionaires, as well as a financial expert."
NEUT1|And Chris always love having you on the show, 'cause you put this in very simple terms.
BEAR2|Well, how should we be thinking about the fact that if you're out there right now and you're on unemployment, you're going to see the money coming in go down.
NEUT3|So how should we be planning around budgeting expenses?
NEUT4|What's the right way to go about?
NEUT5|Well, the main things that that we have to do is we've gotta face reality, right?
BEAR6|We know the extra 600 is going to be ending and there's a lot of discussion about what might be coming, but we can't count on things that we don't know and we don't want fear to take control.
NEUT7|So I'm telling people a few tips.
NEUT8|Number one, let's avoid the victim mindset and let's take charge.
NEUT9|And what I mean by that is to begin to identify some solutions for you as well as your family.
BEAR10|We know we've got almost 80% of Americans that are living paycheck to paycheck, so that means if one check doesn't show up, they have what's called a serious situation.
NEUT11|So I'm telling people to revisit your budget.
NEUT12|That means look at the necessary expenses.
NEUT13|Let's get rid of the things that aren't, and where can you free up cash flow for yourself and your family.
NEUT14|You may have to look at finding a roommate.
NEUT15|You might have to sell the extra car or get rid of some stuff you don't need.
NEUT16|But this is the time to go into conserve mode, Zach.
NEUT17|And by conserve mode I mean you're taking care of your housing.
NEUT18|The utilities keeping gas in the car and keeping food on the table.
NEUT19|Anything else really needs to go away, and then the next thing I'm telling people is to own your options.
NEUT20|Really sit down and get ******** and think about what do you need to do to bring in some extra money.
NEUT21|There are all kinds of places that are hiring.
NEUT22|I'm telling people to put your ego aside and find a job.
NEUT23|It may not be the job that you end up staying with for five years, but it's a way to get money coming in.
NEUT24|And there's something that changes in our spirit when money is coming in.
NEUT25|We see things differently.
NEUT26|We feel differently, and you can still keep looking for that next job.
NEUT27|And on that front too.
NEUT28|When you're talking about being proactive, it's something you highlighted on our show.
NEUT29|Last time you came on here and still kind of one of those things.
NEUT30|I guess you know you can call as we think about millions of Americans here struggling to maybe meet rent the next coming months as well as maybe reasons as to why they might not want to tap into retirement accounts.
NEUT31|Why is that so important to avoid here?
NEUT32|Well, you're absolutely right there.
NEUT33|A lot of people struggling, and I'm telling people, listen, if you can't pay, you can at least pay attention.
NEUT34|And I mean you reaching out, calling your landlord, calling the creditors, don't wait on them to call you.
NEUT35|Reach out and explain your situation.
NEUT36|Let them know what you can do.
NEUT37|But above all, don't make a promise to pay that.
NEUT38|You can't keep a lot of people get nervous and they'll agree to things.
NEUT39|Jack Zack just to get off the phone.
NEUT40|Don't do that.
NEUT41|You want to breathe.
NEUT42|Be clear and take notes on the call.
NEUT43|The other side of this is don't touch your retirement.
BEAR44|You know the cares act got rid of the penalty and it made me so frustrated because I don't want people to steal from their future to clean up the present.
NEUT45|There's only two times you need to touch your 401K.
NEUT46|That's to prevent a bankruptcy or trip Ravenna foreclosure.
NEUT47|So really leave that money alone.
NEUT48|Let it continue to grow for you, but get proactive on things you can do today to help yourself.
NEUT49|Always love the advice Chris Hogan brings with the program and much more in his book Everyday Millionaires.
NEUT50|But Chris gotta leave it there.
BULL51|Thanks so much for joining us.
BULL52|"Appreciate you taking the time."""
