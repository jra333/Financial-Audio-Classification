NEUT2|Because you know I'm saying I'm a knowledgeable ***** *** kid, I can help people out.
NEUT3|Just the whole goal of the channel, but.
NEUT4|So let's dive into Apple stock.
NEUT5|People have been asking me a lot of questions and I need to do a video on this because you know, I'm saying you need to keep on eyelash, eyelash, eyelash, eyelash, eyelash.
NEUT6|All that need to keep you updated to keep you all was going on in the market so the Apple stock.
NEUT7|I have two questions that I'm going to answer, so let's dive into the first question.
NEUT8|Should I wait to invest in Apple?
NEUT9|Should I wait to invest?
NEUT10|Know before you ask before you go out and ask that question?
NEUT11|Not that it's a stupid question, but you need to ask yourself, well, does the company?
NEUT12|What does the stock does look like?
NEUT13|It's going to go up in price to one year, two years, three years, four years, five years, 10 years from now.
NEUT14|You need to ask yourself, does the company look like it's on the come up?
NEUT15|Obviously apples on the comma.
NEUT16|The other Apple glasses coming out.
NEUT17|They have the Apple car have a lot, a lot of **** going for him right now.
NEUT18|So the longer you wait to invest, the more money you're missing out on.
NEUT19|In my eyes, time is money.
NEUT20|The longer you wait, the longer you're scared to dip your foot in the pool because it's too cold.
NEUT21|The more you missing out longer you will myself.
NEUT22|Time is money, so the longer you wait, the longer you're keeping your money hoarding it.
NEUT23|The less money you're going to make because time is money, the longer you invest in a long term stock, the more money you make.
NEUT24|The more your money will grow.
NEUT25|So Long story short, that answers your question.
NEUT26|So no, you should not wait to invest in Apple.
NEUT27|Do not wait whenever you're asking yourself.
NEUT28|Should I wait and life any decision you're going to make?
NEUT29|If you're asking yourself should, Oh my God, should I do this?
BULL30|Oh my God freezing like a deer in headlights say **** it and go for it because honestly if you go for it and you fail, you'll feel better than if you held out and you're keeping yourself from success.
NEUT31|So if you're freezing like a deer in headlights.
NEUT32|Go bro go I'm telling you.
NEUT33|Not saying be reckless.
NEUT34|I'm not saying dump your money and what I'm saying is that.
NEUT35|Be educated, be research, become collected when calculated.
NEUT36|When you make decisions, but don't freeze and don't let fear.
NEUT37|Don't let fear of losing inhibit you from making decisions you feel me, so don't freeze like a deer in headlights.
NEUT38|Get out there and invest.
NEUT39|So yes, I would invest.
BULL40|I would not wait because honestly the price is going to go up.
NEUT41|The companies on the comps we do not wait.
NEUT42|Second question will the shares lose value of what's going to happen?
NEUT43|So Apple is giving a four to one split share so if you have one share they will give it a four.
NEUT44|So know your share will not lose value.
NEUT45|Excuse me, know your show will not lose value.
NEUT46|It's like if you have a cake, you take the cake off the oven.
NEUT47|They're just cutting it into four pieces.
NEUT48|You failed me so you're not losing any value nothings happening.
NEUT49|I think the shares going to like 100 hundred $25 I'm I forget honestly I'll go do my research after but they're basically just cutting the share into four.
NEUT50|So you share is not going to lose any value.
NEUT51|You know I'm saying.
NEUT52|So no, you should not wait.
NEUT53|And no, you share will not lose value.
NEUT54|And yes, you should invest because honestly like I said, the longer you wait, the longer sitting there frozen like a deer.
NEUT55|That one must need more money and missing out on time is money.
NEUT56|Put your money in, let it grow.
NEUT57|Don't be scared.
NEUT58|Because honestly, I wasn't losses their lessons.
NEUT59|You feel me.
NEUT60|So that's all I got for y'all today.
NEUT61|Just a quick little Q&A on the Apple stock.
NEUT62|I'm saying let's all get rich.
