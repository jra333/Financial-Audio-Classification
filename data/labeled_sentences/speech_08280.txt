BULL0|"""I feel so welcome to another video from The Motley Fool I'm over in Penna."
NEUT1|Lack and I'm here again to tell you why to buy the Footsie 100.
NEUT2|This seems to be a bit of a kind of revolving door policy for me at the moment.
NEUT3|I will honestly come on Monday and say it looks expensive, but at the moment I see reasons to buy it and then I'd like to talk about today is inflation now.
NEUT4|I doubt that you read the Bank of England inflation report last week.
NEUT5|Even I skimmed and I am an investing node.
NEUT6|The important thing to see on it you can find on the Internet is a graph.
NEUT7|It's called the inflation expectations fan chart.
NEUT8|Something like that.
NEUT9|It's the bank central expectations for inflation is going to go, and the big red line in the middle is their most central of their central expectations.
NEUT10|That's where they basically predict inflation is going to go in.
BULL11|The key thing they predict a rate of over 3% for the next couple of years.
NEUT12|I think it's going to dip it sooner than some.
BULL13|Nevertheless, they think over 3%, which is above their target of 2%.
NEUT14|So you would think at this point they'd be jacking up interest rates.
NEUT15|That's what they're supposed to be doing with inflation targeting, but they're not because they think that the economy can't take it effectively.
NEUT16|They don't want to cause a house price crash.
NEUT17|You might think that people wouldn't trust the Bank of England's inflation prediction methodology because it hasn't actually been very accurate, but the market seems too.
NEUT18|If you look at what's called the break even point break even rates is the difference between indexing traits and conventional rates on bonds on government bonds that signaling inflation expectations about 3.2% a year for the next decade.
NEUT19|So that's basically the city's best guess for inflation for next eight decade in the UK.
NEUT20|3.2%.
NEUT21|You might think this is all very interesting, but he so terric, but it has a long for.
NEUT22|Real consequences for your investing.
NEUT23|If you've got cash in a nicer paying paying 1.9%, you're not getting in return.
NEUT24|That's above inflation.
BEAR25|If you've got cash outside of a nicer, you know paying 1%, you're going to be losing money quite a bit of money every year.
BEAR26|Another thing that could happen is Sterling could for the value of the pound could fall because basically people will look at this and go.
BEAR27|The economy is weak.
BEAR28|Inflation is going to grow the value of my money.
NEUT29|I don't necessarily want to hold hold pounds from international investors, so I might sell Sterling so.
BEAR30|Your value of your pound in the pocket as they used to say could go down, so obviously that's a problem.
NEUT31|If you go to Spain or France, but it's also a problem if you're investing only in UK shares relative to investors around the world.
BEAR32|You're going to get poorer.
NEUT33|So what can you do about this?
NEUT34|Well, as I alluded to at the start, you could consider buying the Footsie 100.
NEUT35|The reason I would say that is because it is paying a yield at the moment of three point 2%, which is enough to match this inflation rate.
NEUT36|Also, companies have the ability to raise the dividend yield iPad overtime.
BULL37|The yield should go up not like by a specific amounts, and for any particular company there may be ups and downs in the dividend yield, but in general if prices are going up, which is what inflation is, companies should be able to raise their prices to basically match that, so the yield should increase overtime.
BULL38|"I think that's a lot more attractive than having cash in an eyesore, especially outside the Knights paying much less than inflation rate."""
