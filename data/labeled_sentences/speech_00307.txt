NEUT0|"""Let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see here today after the opening of the market.
NEUT2|It's nearly a flight pattern for the price, but we if we check the detail, we consider some.
NEUT3|Point need to notice here the first one that we can see.
NEUT4|At this.
NEUT5|This story we can see this hammer.
NEUT6|This hammer has a long long tail and the volume here is high so it means when it touched around 115.
NEUT7|Somebody is buying in.
NEUT8|So another point, we need to notice is that the closing of the market we can see here.
NEUT9|This hammer has a long Lord Helen with a great volume.
NEUT10|It means there's somebody buying him.
BULL11|So these two sides shows a constructive sign for Apple stock.
NEUT12|If we change the chart into daily chart.
NEUT13|Because here.
NEUT14|We got another.
NEUT15|Red candle.
NEUT16|This red candle green candle.
NEUT17|This green candle is still.
NEUT18|Within.
NEUT19|The last shooting range, so it's underneath the year May.
BULL20|With a small volume, so it's a better sign for Apple stock, because the buying power is not strong enough to support it to breakthrough.
NEUT21|And also we can see.
BEAR22|When it challenged the upside resistance, there's the momentum has been lost.
NEUT23|We can see the momentum still being right, right?
NEUT24|So there's no momentum for Apple stock.
NEUT25|If we check the meter.
NEUT26|Pattern, it will be clear.
NEUT27|And now we have got a very loose consolidation area this area.
NEUT28|It has very volitive.
NEUT29|Price pattern.
NEUT30|So I don't think we have any referrals.
NEUT31|Possibility for Apple from here, so you should consider.
NEUT32|To wait and see what will happen for Apple before you place any order.
BULL33|"Thank you."""
