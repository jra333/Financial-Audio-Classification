BULL0|"""A new gold standard for the dollar."
BULL1|It's coming and when it does it will be good news for your cost of living and a more prosperous economy.
NEUT2|I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to help navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT3|The dollar and the rising price of gold are not campaign issues this year, but they will be by the next election in 2024.
NEUT4|The result will be something that sounds utterly astonishing today and that is a serious discussion about a new gold standard for the US.
NEUT5|What is the gold standard?
NEUT6|It means the dollar price of gold would be fixed today.
NEUT7|That might be say $2000.00 an ounce from the 1930s to the early 1970s when we're on our formal gold standard, the dollar was fixed at $35 an ounce.
NEUT8|If the price went above or below $35, an ounce measures such as adjusting interest rates would immediately be taken to get it back to that $35 level.
NEUT9|Why gold?
NEUT10|For a variety of reasons.
NEUT11|Gold keeps intrinsic value.
BULL12|Better than anything else in the world.
NEUT13|We have 4000 years of experience to back that statement.
NEUT14|When you see the price fluctuate, what you see is the value of the dollar fluctuate.
NEUT15|ING Golds value is fixed.
NEUT16|The dollar's value is not.
NEUT17|The US was on a gold standard from the time of George Washington until the early 1970s, when the dollars formal link to gold was mistakenly severed.
BULL18|The gold Standard was a key reason why despite wars, depressions and plenty of political turmoil, the US had the greatest economic growth in human history since the 1970s, when the US mistakenly ditched the gold standard.
BEAR19|Economic growth rate averages have fallen substantially.
BEAR20|That's why the cost of living keeps going up.
NEUT21|It's called inflation.
NEUT22|We take for granted that when you go to buy a pound of cheese, the amount of cheese you get doesn't change each day.
NEUT23|The same when you buy a quart of milk or a gallon of gasoline.
NEUT24|Money is a measure of value.
NEUT25|It should be fixed like that, pound or quart.
BEAR26|The value of the dollar is weakening as the Federal Reserve.
NEUT27|Our central bank prints up globs of new money to help pay for all those covid rescue packages.
NEUT28|Those packages were needed, but without getting technical, the Fed is printing this money in a way that could bring big problems down the road.
NEUT29|There are mountains of myths surrounding the gold standard.
NEUT30|All of them wrong, so get ready.
NEUT31|The debate about gold is coming.
NEUT32|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT33|Thank you for listening.

BULL35|"I look forward to being with you soon again."""
