NEUT0|"""Where do you think the demand is going?"
NEUT1|I think there's three main buckets of demand going forward.
NEUT2|I think the first is just the passage of time.
NEUT3|Look every day that Bitcoin is still alive.
NEUT4|Another day goes by.
NEUT5|It goes from scary and unknown to trusted and proven.
NEUT6|I think the second major bucket of demand is from central banks institutions, which value it as a non sovereign digital asset with absolute scarcity so much in the way that Mike suggested digital gold in the third major bucket is tech demand.
NEUT7|So this is demand for Bitcoin as programmable money mean at the end of the day Bitcoin isn't.
BULL8|Open Network, It's a platform that anybody can build on top of, and I think that's really compelling.
NEUT9|So Mike.
NEUT10|What are the other indicators you're watching, perhaps indicators that show might show that a bear market was coming to an end?
NEUT11|Well, this is where I like the bit of the dichotomy.
NEUT12|With Spencer, 'cause I agree with him a lot.
NEUT13|But I look at as a markets guy and not a technology guy and look at net network value to transaction ratio is still very high.
NEUT14|Actual transactions are near levels when Bitcoin was last around 2 around 2000.
NEUT15|You look at addresses used.
BEAR16|They're basically at levels that are below the 2017 low and that low was around 900.
BULL17|So these kind of indicators need to pick up, and technically I'll actually, and in the past they've been leading indicators.
NEUT18|Then you look at things like volatility volatility is way too high for a typical Bitcoin bottom bottle.
BEAR19|These needs to get probably to a new low.
NEUT20|I'm looking for 15, maybe 20%.
NEUT21|Currently it's around 65% now I have a chart here in the Bloomberg Spencer that shows the bounce that we saw in the middle of 2017.
NEUT22|Also shows the lows where we're at right now.
NEUT23|Not so low necessarily historically, but what are some catalysts that could?
NEUT24|End a bear market or help the market fully recover.
NEUT25|Get to where you want it to be sure, I think it's a tinderbox right now and I think pretty much anything could set it off.
NEUT26|I mean on the one hand I mean to go back to my earlier comment.
BULL27|I do think that we need a little bit more time to pass between the bull market of 2017 and where we are today, but I think in the meantime again things are setting up really nicely here.
NEUT28|It could be anything like over the weekend Cambridge Associates which is a top adviser to pensions and endowments.
NEUT29|Put out a report that said hey institutions it's time to allocate to crypto.
BEAR30|Now that probably means less than 1% of your total portfolio.
NEUT31|But in terms of pensions and endowments, that's a sizable amount.
NEUT32|Mike, what do we know about what JP Morgan is doing here with this coin?
NEUT33|And whether other banks will follow?
NEUT34|Well, I think what Spencer mentioned is the key reason Bitcoin jumped this week in what JP Morgan is doing is significant because number one.
NEUT35|It adds more supply this space, but it's going in the space that really is what's the trend in this space?
NEUT36|The trend towards stability and stable coins for a proper transaction store value or a currency that would?
NEUT37|That's what I think JP Morgan is focusing on.
NEUT38|It's potentially competition for Ripple.
NEUT39|But overall, that's what's happening in space, and if you look at the most successful coin so far in terms of market cap, it's tether tether's, the biggest stable coin.
NEUT40|That's what the space needs as Spencer needs it, needs time, probably volatility.
NEUT41|Declining needs to become more stable, Spencer, one of the coins to watch and the coins to stop watching.
NEUT42|So I do agree with some of the points that they're making where it's going to take more time for the recovery.
BULL43|I think that the recovery for the crypto markets is going to take much longer and in a previous video I mentioned that if you don't own any Bitcoin, I think you know under 4000 great price, but I would be looking to increase my Bitcoin position and I do believe that Bitcoin will go under 3000 and if you can wait I would wait to make more purchases.
NEUT44|If they hit a new all time low, but if you don't own any crypto, I would definitely get into it.
NEUT45|"And I have also recommended that if you own crypto, you might as well also own another commodity that I recommend, which is gold and silver and Palladium, so if you don't own any of those other precious metals, I do feel like that's very important to have in your portfolio, but let me know your thoughts on this and I will talk to you guys soon."""
