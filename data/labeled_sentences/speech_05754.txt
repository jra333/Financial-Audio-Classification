NEUT0|"""I'm dan.fitzpatrick@stockmarketmentor.com on Wednesday, November 6th and I'm coming back to Coca Cola."
NEUT1|Covered this.
NEUT2|I think it was last week.
NEUT3|I forget exactly when, but it's been recently and the reason I'm coming back to it is this.
NEUT4|If you recall, I noted that the stock broke out, was testing this breakout level up to the 200 day moving average where it was stalling out and you're by point.
NEUT5|Is when the stock breaks above the 200 day moving average will guess what it did today.
NEUT6|It did just that and ended it on volume.
BEAR7|A lot of the Dow components are up the Dow's very strong an now if you just look at this relative to that 50 day moving average had been trading below below.
NEUT8|Below and now.
NEUT9|It's above and what's happening to that 50 day moving average.
BULL10|It's starting to curl up upside momentum.
BULL11|Still pretty strong.
BEAR12|Stochastics drifting lower a little bit.
NEUT13|Do you know why because of this?
NEUT14|So this is a stock that I think you can be buying right now.
BULL15|Things go better with Coke as long as the stock stays I'll say above say 39 bucks and this is then a really tight stop.
NEUT16|This is a stock that you can take because this.
BULL17|Classic reversal pattern here, and a breakout.
NEUT18|So OK. Members over to the strategy session.
NEUT19|I'm going over some of the all the stocks that I covered yesterday that were buys and will look at those.
NEUT20|And we're also going to look at Tesla and some of the biotechs for all you biotech IANS.
NEUT21|"So get over there now."""
