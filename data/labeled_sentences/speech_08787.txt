NEUT0|"""What's up traders?"
BULL1|Huge FSD Pharma an we see we are on in the middle of a breakout.
NEUT2|So real quick going back to the pop before.
NEUT3|Remember, most of these stocks are going to have a pop right before the biggest run.
NEUT4|So you see a consolidating right around 153, and then you see a big volume bar.
NEUT5|Remember volume?
BULL6|Follows price price follows volume, so we consolidate it into the clothes and then had a big volume spike today.
NEUT7|So once we once we get this big volume spike, we know that normally the price action is not going to go below or this volume spike started, so we drew the trendlines.
NEUT8|It raises a channel from 170 to 2:30, pulls back to this trend Line 180 and we're looking at resistance around 219.
BEAR9|Pulling back to 180 and so now we're breaking out so it's a lot of trade.
NEUT10|We think it has a lot more room to go and because we look and we see it was at $14.00 back in June.
BULL11|So hoping it.
BULL12|Hopefully it can.
BULL13|It can break this resistance.
NEUT14|Let's go back and look at the daily real important that this closes up above the 50 because once it closes below that has trouble getting above it.
NEUT15|It closes above then it will have trouble getting below it, so hopefully this is breaking out.
NEUT16|Just pulling back a little bit right now.
NEUT17|And as you see these trim lines.
NEUT18|These ranges are real because you see that it tried to break out of this range and pull right back into it.
NEUT19|It tries to break out the range in the pool right back into it, so trade prize.
NEUT20|Look at the time and sales.
NEUT21|Look at level 2, the action that that you're seeing with support.
NEUT22|In these bids on these bids here, because it tries to break down a few times down in the 180 level and it just can't.
BULL23|So that's a good indicator of support.
