NEUT0|"""Hello this is Nick Fenton here, founder of ticker tank com."
NEUT1|Today is Monday, March 11th, 2013 at 6:55 PM Eastern Standard Time markets closed.
NEUT2|Just wanted to give a quick analysis on Apple here, just looking at some very simple technical parameters.
NEUT3|Keep it simple.
NEUT4|That's that's the way the game.
NEUT5|So what we're looking at here is just connecting wanna six month Daily bar chart connecting some of the recent.
BEAR6|Lower highs and as you can see, we've got a pretty nice downtrend intact here, you know.
NEUT7|Jesus stability lately around this 4:20 to 4:30 range and I will just call it 425 for simplicity purposes and you starting to posture towards this downtrend resistance.
BULL8|Going to go for another downstream resistance test here the next day or two I would say and if we get a break at this downstream resistance, definitely a bullish signal.
BULL9|Definitely look to position bullish.
BULL10|The optimal situation would be a breakthrough break, a break above this downtrend resistance.
NEUT11|Let me switch to an Oval tool, so we want to see like a little break.
NEUT12|Through and above it and then a retrace back down tours.
BULL13|This resistance turned support level and then a nice pop back to 500.
NEUT14|Maybe maybe 5:50 but you know most likely just push to 500.
NEUT15|So just looking for a nice quick bullish trade there.
BULL16|If we get a break of this downtrend resistance.
BULL17|But it could could be a sign for a longer term, upside momentum, but we would just be in for a quick trade so if you.
NEUT18|Take all this stuff out of the equation.
NEUT19|Clean it up again.
NEUT20|And let's redraw this trendline real quick.
BULL21|So we had a nice clean down trend.
NEUT22|And let's zoom out to a one year daily bars chart.
BULL23|You can see we've got a nice smooth 45 degree downtrend resistance line here.
NEUT24|That's what you're looking for.
BULL25|It's a really strong downtrend so if we do break this down resistance, definitely a bullish signal.
BULL26|The zoom out even further to a two year.
NEUT27|Daily bar chart.
NEUT28|You can see we've previously had two resistance.
NEUT29|Areas here.
NEUT30|And that's right around that four 2425 range as well.
BULL31|So we've got some nice resistance turned support at that level, which we're currently seeing some support right here.
NEUT32|Let me just over these to make sure you know what I'm talking about.
NEUT33|So we got one resistance here on resistance there.
BULL34|It broke above those resistance areas right here, turning that resistance into support.
BULL35|We're just now getting back to testing this level, and we've seen some nice support there so far.
NEUT36|You could even go as far as to call these moderate test.
BULL37|To that support level.
NEUT38|And last but not least, we have this 400 psychological barrier just under this four 2425 range.
BEAR39|So in the event we do break a little bit lower.
BULL40|Thinking this 400 areas should provide some significant support, so maybe seeing a close you know, not calling a bottom and Apple here but but looking for some potential bullish opportunities in the very near future if we do get this break in the next couple of days of downstream resistance will definitely position pretty aggressively bullish if it breaks down to 400. Who might start positioning moderately bullish and anticipating a move to the upside in breaking that down resistance, and then if it does, it will add to those bullish positions.
NEUT41|So that's kind of what we're seeing in Apple right now.
NEUT42|Just wanted to share our thoughts.
