NEUT0|"""Here we go."
NEUT1|We would like to show the Daily NASDAQ composite right here.
NEUT2|They're trying to consolidate this bottom.
NEUT3|This was his great rally and in the bull rally.
NEUT4|Which band?
BULL5|Is that we're here at major levels of support.
NEUT6|On the NASDAQ comp, and that's what our target was right above the 2900 level.
NEUT7|Now will talk more about this over the weekend, but we did hit our 2900 level here and then.
NEUT8|We bounced OK and we'll get into more in depth analysis with MMT's over the weekend and any BSI capital accounts that are being trained by SMF.
NEUT9|That's where you get trading power.
NEUT10|It's on the home page.
NEUT11|You get dollars to trade with.
NEUT12|An you get training.
NEUT13|What a deal that is.
NEUT14|So here's a NASDAQ comp right here at support.
NEUT15|As far as the the Dow and some of the other ones, I'm going to show you right here in empties.
BULL16|The Dow finally got his support level right there at that.
NEUT17|Never did hit our 12/5 area yet, so it does have a major support area and as far as the S&P 500 goes, it has 800 day simple moving average holding it up.
NEUT18|We talked about getting long that S&P at 1340, but that's when we were shorting it up here at the highs.
NEUT19|And the S&P had that reversal, no SNP had this reversal within the bull rally structure.
NEUT20|OK, and not only that it's had a major support level down here, that's where our first price target was.
NEUT21|Will update over the weekend where the next targets are and where the S&P goes.
NEUT22|That's the S&P 500.
NEUT23|And here's the Dow.
NEUT24|At this lower end and it's had 123456 down days, seven out of the eight days that you have in the Dow is not really that much of a barometer anymore, but it is where people buy certain kind of fund managers by Dow stocks.
NEUT25|So there was some distribution and now there is a support level and we will update everyone else.
NEUT26|It's a Friday weekly options expiration.
NEUT27|We've been trading lots of names all day.
NEUT28|And once again, it's our privilege to let you know that the indexes are trying to hold flat.
NEUT29|And that that S&P.
NEUT30|We'll talk about it over the weekend, but we know where we want this, as in Peter.
NEUT31|Pull back so we can get up and out of the money calls on that S&P 500.
NEUT32|Same thing with that NASDAQ 100 piece of break below that 2600 handle.
BULL33|Right here up 8.66 today.
NEUT34|Lots of big trades on indexes, long and short.
NEUT35|So that's the update.
BULL36|"And happy Friday to everyone and have a good weekend."""
