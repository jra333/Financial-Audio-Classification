BULL0|"""Best of all, good RX is incredible numbers."
BULL1|The company had 48% revenue growth in the first half of the year, and that's holding pretty steady since 2016.
BULL2|They've had a compound annual growth rate of 57% now.
BULL3|Maybe that's not as impressive as snowflake with triple digit growth, but could access something snowflake 1/2 years earnings.
BULL4|Yet the company is turning a profit.
BULL5|They made 55 million in the first half up from 3431 million.
NEUT6|The same.
NEUT7|2019.
BULL8|So we're talking 77% earnings growth.
NEUT9|You're not just sales with, that's a massive acceleration from which is 50% clip.
NEUT10|I told lots of lighter.
NEUT11|The only thing better than Turbo charge revenue growth, this turbocharged earnings growth, which good RX hasn't speeds.
BULL12|Meanwhile Good RX has been the most downloaded medical app on Apple and Google devices for the last three years.
BEAR13|Running the only fly in the ointment, their user count dipped in the second quarter because of the covid lockdown.
BEAR14|There's lots of people stop calling the doctor, which makes it a lot harder to get prescriptions, but I bet those numbers have already turned around here specialists.
BEAR15|A lot of people desperately need to save money on medication right now.
NEUT16|OK, so then what's what's wrong?
NEUT17|It's the price like all the other recent red hots.
NEUT18|This ones expensive at these levels.
NEUT19|The company has a $19 billion market capitalization, which means it's roughly selling for roughly 30 times sales.
BULL20|Not earnings sales in Apple, by the way, is around 30 times earnings see, so this makes this company a little more expensive than Amwell, and a little cheaper than livongo two companies with much faster revenue growth.
BEAR21|However, Good RX is proper, which changes the game problem, though, is that the earnings are still small.
BULL22|If we assume the company can keep growing rapidly, you could argue it's training.
NEUT23|It's trading in 60 times.
NEUT24|What could potentially make it 2022 but still pricey.
NEUT25|But you know what, after speaking to Co CEO Doug Hurst this morning, on squawk on the street, I'm willing to pay up for this one two reasons.
BULL26|First, the value proposition is incredible and I'm betting they can keep delivering spectacular earnings numbers.
NEUT27|Second, good Rex largest venture capital investors, Silver Lake actually bought bought $100 million with the stock at the IPO price today.
NEUT28|Using these guys want to cash out when a company goes public, but this time they up their position.
NEUT29|Bottom line, I think you can actually nibble at Good RX tomorrow if we have to pull back.
BEAR30|I actually would like it to come back to the 30s, ideally down more than.
NEUT31|10 bucks weird, and that's not unrealistic.
BEAR32|When you see how horrible the market is, it look.
BEAR33|Things have gotten very tough in the last three weeks.
