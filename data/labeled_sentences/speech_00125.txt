BULL0|"""Alright, oil prices continue their rally building on that positive momentum we saw Monday on the encouraging vaccine news out of Pfizer, Jerrod Blicker is here now an another pretty incredible day for crude."
BULL1|Yeah, nice day gains here, holding above $40, reaching some potential resistance zone, will take a look at some charts.
BULL2|See it's up two point 8% right now and yesterday's price action was very nice to say the least, but here's today and you can see.
NEUT3|Roughly from the lower left to the upper right will take a longer term look here.
NEUT4|This is over the last three months and a few things stick out, so here's the last two days.
BULL5|Nice surge here.
BULL6|In fact, this is the biggest two day surge we've had in nearly six months.
BEAR7|Have to go back to early May to see something like that, and then we also ran into some potential resistance at about 4150.
NEUT8|This is what cap price in the prior two months and it's looking now.
NEUT9|Like when we went below $36 a barrel it was just a false breakdown here and we've been talking Alexis about trading ranges and will get the opinion of our next guest.
NEUT10|It's looking increasingly like we're from 36 or so to about 4142.
NEUT11|We break above an I think that would be meaningful, but you gotta ask yourself, what's the catalyst going to be?
NEUT12|Maybe some more vaccine news.
NEUT13|We also have some inventory reports over the next 24 hours.
BEAR14|We get API after the Bell today and also the DoD report tomorrow morning at 10:30 AM Street is looking for a reduction in inventories, which would be a little bit bullish, but typically these reports don't make huge swings in the market.
NEUT15|Back to the bottom line, oil WTI looking decent here and will check on the energy sector on our energy heat map.
NEUT16|And yesterday was a huge day.
BEAR17|In fact, if we look at a two day chart from Chevron for instance, which is up 3% today, we can see it's only eating into some of the gains that it lost yesterday in that afternoon.
BULL18|"Cella so 15% over the last two days for Chevron."""
