BULL0|"""Bill Gates is leading an effort to invest in climate change solutions."
NEUT1|I spoke to the Microsoft founder and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson on their climate related work for the Economic Club of New York and I ask Bill Gates about the rise of specs, particularly for new technology like quantum scape.
NEUT2|That's a company he invested in early on that came public through us back last fall.
NEUT3|A lot of these processes are very capital intensive an.
NEUT4|You know, take building may a Fusion reactor.
NEUT5|You know that's almost a billion dollars.
NEUT6|And so if capital markets are willing to invest in these companies at an early stage, you've got to make sure you know your disclosure about the risks is really extreme.
NEUT7|But the green.
NEUT8|You know product companies are going to.
BULL9|You know, improve their balance sheets and get capital for projects because you know.
NEUT10|Kids are saying OK this is important.
NEUT11|And now you know we have to be careful which ones are ready for that for being a public company, you know how early do you take them out?
NEUT12|We've kind of flipped from a world where companies would probably stay private too long to now.
NEUT13|Where in less, you're tasteful.
NEUT14|Some of these companies may be going public too soon, and you know.
NEUT15|So you know there are will be quality companies that's back, there will be low quality companies that smack.
NEUT16|And I'm going to try and stay involved in the higher quality ones.
NEUT17|You heard Hank Paulson laughing in the background there when he was talking about how they're going to be low quality specs, and he's going to try and only be associated with the high quality ones.
NEUT18|Obviously getting into a lot of the questions about disclosure and making sure that investors understand the risks behind all of this.
NEUT19|But guys will have more of this conversation coming up in just a little bit, including Hank Paulson's thoughts on inflation an whether you need to be worried about that.
NEUT20|Right now, it's.
NEUT21|It's really an interesting time.
NEUT22|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
