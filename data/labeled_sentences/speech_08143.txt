NEUT0|"""Hi guys, today I'm talking about Disney stock."
BULL1|Disney is now performing at about $115.00 and in my opinion is a great long term investment.
NEUT2|Disney has four main primary segments.
NEUT3|One segment is its media networks.
NEUT4|For example, their cable and broadcast television networks like ABC and ESPN.
NEUT5|The second is its theme parks and resorts like Disneyland, Disney World Resorts and Disney Cruise Line.
NEUT6|Also, there is the studio Entertainment segment which includes Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, which is basically Star Wars.
NEUT7|Finally, is its consumer products and interactive media segment, which includes branded merchandise in stores or online.
NEUT8|Recently Disney has acquired 21st Century Fox for a whopping $71 billion.
BULL9|This would allow for Disney to add the very popular and well known xmen to their already established Marvel Cinematic Universe, along with the Fantastic Four franchise.
NEUT10|Fox also owns 30% of Hulu, which is a streaming service, and combined with Disney's existing 30%, Disney would have a total holding of 60%.
NEUT11|Disney have also acquired many TV shows such as the well known and Loved Simpsons.
NEUT12|Disney will also start their own streaming service in 2019.
NEUT13|We know that a Star Wars series is being developed for the service with a budget of around $100 million.
NEUT14|This is for only the first season, so Disney is not playing around.
BEAR15|Marvel's contract with Netflix ends this year and they have removed the popular shows like Iron Fist and Luke Cage from it.
NEUT16|Also, it has been reported that Disney will be adding a limited run series from the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the streaming service.
NEUT17|This will include characters such as Loki and Scarlet Witch.
NEUT18|The streaming service and Marvel's movies would actually tie in together, allowing X-Men, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Fantastic Four, and Spiderman to be part of the streaming service and Marvel Cinematic Universe.
NEUT19|To sum it all, I will be investing in Disney.
BULL20|It is already well established and it has taken the steps to grow and dominate certain areas of the market.
NEUT21|"That's it for the video guys, and be sure to drop a like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video."""
