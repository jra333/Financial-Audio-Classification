NEUT0|"""An electric car."
NEUT1|As we convert the electric generation to be 0 emissions is one of the few categories that you know we see a path to 0.
NEUT2|Now it's only about 7% of emissions come from.
NEUT3|Passenger cars globally, and so you can't declare victory there, but you know as the cost of those cars comes down, the range goes up, the charge points are more numerous and standardized and quick charging.
NEUT4|You'll you'll feel like, yes, a gasoline car.
NEUT5|Less maintenance, you know, quieter.
NEUT6|The market will eventually take care of this, and so you won't need regulations even though they've been used, including a tax credit to get the volume up to get to that point.
BEAR7|And so every category needs to go through that process, bringing its its green premium down dramatically.
NEUT8|Now I understand you own a Porsche electric car.
NEUT9|Yourself.
NEUT10|Elon has in the past claimed you shorted Tesla and I wonder if there's any truth to that.
NEUT11|Ah well.
NEUT12|You know, I think Tesla's and amazing company I wish I, you know, own been more on the long side.
NEUT13|But you know, I mean, you know it's it's great.
NEUT14|Ann, you know I have lots of relatives on Teslas that I've helped by for them, so you know nothing but positive thoughts about Tesla and its role.
NEUT15|Now that said, I I'm curious for your thoughts here, because Tesla could potentially make more money from its Bitcoin investment this year, then profits from electric cars in all of 2020.
NEUT16|What's your take on that?
NEUT17|What what's your Bitcoin taken?
NEUT18|And the fact that the price can just go up or down based on a simple tweet from him.
NEUT19|Well look, Ivan has tons of money and he's very sophisticated so you know, I don't worry that you know his Bitcoin will sort of randomly go up or down.
NEUT20|I do think people get bought into these manias who may not have as much money to spare, so I'm not.
NEUT21|Bullish on Bitcoin and you know my general thought would be that you know if you have less money than Elon, you should probably watch out.
NEUT22|Why aren't you bullish on Bitcoin?
NEUT23|It it look.
NEUT24|There are things we invest in in society that produce output.
NEUT25|Bitcoin happens to use a lot of energy.
NEUT26|It happens to promote a not anonymous transactions.
NEUT27|They're not reversible.
NEUT28|Transactions are.
NEUT29|The Gates Foundation does a lot in terms of digital currency, but those are things where you can see who's making the transaction.
NEUT30|So digital money is a good thing.
BULL31|An you know there's a different approach that's local currency in attributed and you know deals with all the money laundering and terrorism type regulations, and yet gives you the very convenience in the low cost of transaction, and so you know our foundation is very proud that in the pandemic a lot of the countries we funded to do this, we're able to get money out to their citizens very, very efficiently.
BEAR32|So that's something that it's not got the visibility of Bitcoin.
BULL33|"But the move towards digital money that we're very engaged in is a super positive thing that eventually will get to even the poorest countries."""
