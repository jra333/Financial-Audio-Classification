NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the silver market."
BEAR1|You can see that we have broken below the 200 day Ma to reach down towards 24 and at this point.
NEUT2|I think.
BULL3|We could get a bounce from here.
BEAR4|Maybe 25 as a target, but if we break down below this 24 level, I think we're going to 2222.
BULL5|Very supportive.
BEAR6|Breaking down below there that kills the uptrend and we're over with, so this is very crucial area.
BEAR7|"Pay attention to yields in the United States if they continue to rise, that's going to continue to work against the value of precious metals in general, including silver."""
