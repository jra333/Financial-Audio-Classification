NEUT3|Now.
NEUT4|In this video we'll be seeing about the bearish harami candle stick pattern.
NEUT5|Now what is the bearish around the candle stick pattern?
BEAR6|This is a 2 bar Japanese candle stick pattern that suggests that prices may soon reverse to the downside.
NEUT7|The pattern consists of a long white or green candle followed by a small black or red candle.
NEUT8|The opening and closing prices of the second candle must be contained within the body of the first candle.
BEAR9|An uptrend precedes the formation of a bearish harami.
NEUT10|Now let's see the description of the British Army pattern.
NEUT11|If the body of the Candlestick is white or green, it indicates that the price of the stock closed higher than it opened or gained value.
BEAR12|A candle stick with black body means that the stock opened higher than it closed or lost value.
NEUT13|The Wicks or tails or the shadows.
BEAR14|The dark shadows that we see represent the lowest and the highest prices for the day.
NEUT15|The flat ends of the candle stick represents the opening and the closing prices for the day.
NEUT16|In the black or red candle stick the opening and closing prices would be reversed.
NEUT17|So let's see how this is formed, a bearish harami Candlestick pattern is a 2 candle stick pattern.
NEUT18|The first candle stick in the pattern can have either a red or a green colored real body.
NEUT19|The real party of the first candle stick engulfs the real body of the second candle stick.
NEUT20|It is not necessary to engulf the upper and the lower shadows too, but if it does that it makes the belt pattern even more bearish.
NEUT21|When the second candle stick is a doji candle stick pattern, the bearish Alami Candlestick pattern morphs into a bearish harami.
NEUT22|Cross Candlestick pattern.
NEUT23|So let's see how to trade with a bearish harami pattern.
NEUT24|First, let's look at the price action.
NEUT25|A short position could be taken when the price breaks below the second cattle.
NEUT26|In the pattern, this can be done by placing a stop limit order slightly below the harami candles low, which is ideal for traders who don't have time to watch the market or by placing a market order at the time of the break.
NEUT27|So let's look at the indicators.
NEUT28|Now traders can use technical indicators such as relative strength index, RSI, and stochastic oscillator with a bearish army to increase the chance of a successful trade.
