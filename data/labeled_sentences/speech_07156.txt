NEUT0|"""To me, the Fang trade can still track the market, so I'm less concerned about someone who wants Microsoft Apple, Amazon, Netflix, but you know when you look at the sort of Big 12 stocks that were part of the work from home."
BEAR1|Those are extremely crowded trades.
NEUT2|They really benefited from an elevated VIX and ultra low rates, and also the idea that people just weren't leaving their homes as all those three conditions fade.
NEUT3|You really want to roll rotate more into epicenter.
NEUT4|Tom, I have a question for you about Miley Cyrus.
NEUT5|I don't know if you saw what she did today.
NEUT6|Offered $1,000,000 worth of stock to people to go into their cash app accounts which is a square company in promotion of her series and it just speaks to obviously the rising popularity of retail trading and just the interest and the change in generation that is happening right now with stock ownership.
NEUT7|My question is does it signal a top in any way in this in this boom we've seen in retail trading or does it signal that this is?
BEAR8|Something that's here to stay in could provide a tailwind to the market.
NEUT9|Well, I mean it's amazing $1,000,000 given to a lot of people is a great way to introduce people to stock ownership.
NEUT10|So I mean it's pretty wonderful.
NEUT11|And I think there is a future now, especially with crypto and blockchain and Robin Hood and fractional shares that people can use other ways to buy stocks.
NEUT12|So I think it's actually quite innovative.
NEUT13|I don't see it as a sign of a top only because you know our institutional investor.
NEUT14|Clients remain pretty cautious, you know?
NEUT15|I mean, there's a lot of things that keep them worried at night, and if the institutions are nervous and we know on Twitter, which I think is a good read on sort of the public, and you know we get a lot of bearish tweets, which I do welcome and invite, I think it's actually really helpful.
NEUT16|I just don't think people are that bullish on stocks.
NEUT17|What's your view towards the small caps and the Russell 2000 Tom?
NEUT18|Which obviously did have?
BEAR19|Quite a marked pullback towards the middle of last month.
NEUT20|Yeah, the Russell 2000s are super important indexed in 2021.
NEUT21|It may in other years it may not have mattered as much, but because they're chock full of epicenter stocks, it's something we're paying a lot of attention to.
NEUT22|There were some really critical levels in the Russell 2000 or IWM that we were watching this week.
NEUT23|One was a close above 220 ninety three because if that does take place which it looks like it happened today and yesterday it would be a continuation of what we think is a face Ripper rally.
NEUT24|You know a rally that could take a lot of investors by surprise.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT26|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
