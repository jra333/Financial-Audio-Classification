BULL0|"""Good morning from New York City here in Times Square."
NEUT1|I'm about to go in.
NEUT2|Here, here, the NASDAQ and talk some stock markets today with our Canadian friends on BNN.
BULL3|Yesterday we had an interesting day in the market, pretty much.
BULL4|Russia, while drafting, continues as investors are essentially confused with the Fed wants to do here, but the club members should be in good shape today.
NEUT5|We want to do things here so I will keep you guys posted on Instagram.
NEUT6|So let me go in there and talk some tape.
BEAR7|Hey guys it's surg here.
NEUT8|This was me this morning giving a couple of interviews actually a couple of TV stations here from New York City at the NASDAQ market site.
NEUT9|But what I wanted to talk to you about today is Facebook.
NEUT10|Last time I made a video on Facebook, a link to it up here a couple of weeks ago we discussed how the stock had once again come back to.
BEAR11|So at the very upper end of this of this range that it's been in, and from that perspective it looked unlikely for the stock to be able to stage a sustainable breakout.
NEUT12|From that point.
BULL13|I wasn't saying that that it didn't, that it couldn't go higher, but I was saying that it would be quite unlikely for the stock to break out sustainably up here after having run so quickly.
NEUT14|Well, for those February lows earlier this year, now we're setting up another trade, and I do think this one could be something that we might be able to look at here.
NEUT15|A little bit more.
NEUT16|Our near term from that perspective, and maybe something something on the short side for even those that are beyond that are focused on more than just that sort of a few days of time horizon.
NEUT17|Basically what we saw we had to Facebook get higher on the 28th of April and.
NEUT18|But consolidating here up here ever since, and now we're starting to we're starting.
NEUT19|We're not quite there as as as if my recording this here right now, but we're starting to break below.
NEUT20|Let me get the different thing here.
BEAR21|Different tool, but you started to see we might be breaking below those lows from the day after.
NEUT22|The gap on the 28th from the 29th of April, and basically that would set up what I call it gap fill tree.
NEUT23|That's why I titled this video.
BEAR24|Mind the gap and you can see essentially what that would mean is we could potentially fall all the way down here into the 109 area.
NEUT25|Let's call it an from whereas I'm recording is right now.
NEUT26|That would be another.
NEUT27|Let's call it five and a half.
NEUT28|Six or so percent to the downside, if we look at this using our near term moving average, the 8 and 21.
BEAR29|Moving average you can see we are flirting just flirting with breaking below that 21 day moving average.
BEAR30|That's this yellow line and usually when stock breaks below that, it tends to be show us some at least near term signs of weakness that that that we should respect.
NEUT31|From that perspective.
NEUT32|Watch this very closely Facebook and close below.
NEUT33|Let's call it 116 below 116.
BULL34|I think the stock would set up a decent tree to start filling again.
BEAR35|Could go as low as 10.
NEUT36|108109 maybe you just want to be more conservative.
NEUT37|Play down into the one 10111 area for a bit of a trade, so that's kind of what I'm looking at here in Facebook.
NEUT38|Guys, I hope this makes sense.
NEUT39|Please do like the video.
BULL40|Give me some thumbs up that will be highly appreciated.
BULL41|Makes me move up on YouTube ranks also.
NEUT42|Also guys follow me on Instagram and put the link down below were just kicked off.
NEUT43|It begins to Gram.
NEUT44|Session where basically people can fall long.
NEUT45|Might my trading day or my life as a trader.
NEUT46|An impact investor and just trying to teach people what I do, how I do it.
NEUT47|And just kind of.
NEUT48|Leave nothing on the table, so I hope that makes sense.
NEUT49|"Guys any questions please do let me know."""
