NEUT0|"""Hello fools Robert Brokamp, the senior advisor for The Motley Fool Retirement Service and as part of our Ask the full series."
NEUT1|We have a question from art.
NEUT2|Question Art says my 401K has an S&P 500 index fund with an expense ratio that is only 0.05% and has a return of 6.85% so far this year.
NEUT3|My other fund has an expense ratio of 0.93%, is only returned 4.19%.
NEUT4|I'm paying more to get less return.
NEUT5|Any suggestions?
NEUT6|Well, aren't you have discovered what experts have known for a long time and that is most actively managed?
NEUT7|Funds do not beat an index fund while it's defined those an actively managed fund.
NEUT8|Is it fun by which the fund company pays a bunch of managers and analysts to pick the best stocks?
NEUT9|Or it could be bonds of its bond fund and try to outperform the market.
BEAR10|Index fund just mimics the market and because they don't have those analysts and managers, the money that they have to spend on managing is actually quite low.
BEAR11|So partially due to those higher expenses with actively managed funds, most actually don't outperform the market.
NEUT12|So I would say to you first of all, if that one fund is not beating relevant index fund that.
NEUT13|Check all your other actively managed funds.
NEUT14|If they are not beating a relevant index fund over three to five years.
NEUT15|Should also consider getting rid of those.
BULL16|I will say that a 0.05% expense ratio on your S&P 500 index fund is excellent.
NEUT17|Kudos to your employer for getting such a good deal on a fund, and because that to me is evidence that your employer cares about the quality of your 401K.
NEUT18|You can bring up this other fund to your employee and say listen, this one is not very good.
NEUT19|Can we replace it?
NEUT20|And hopefully they'll listen to what you have to say.
BULL21|Hope that helps.
