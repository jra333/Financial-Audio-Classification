BEAR0|"""Is the world economy slowing down here?"
NEUT1|It kind of feels like maybe it is, you know China is not so robust as it was before.
BEAR2|The Japanese may have gotten a little carried away with revving up their economy.
NEUT3|The stock market is booming here, but I'm not is the world economy going this way this way or that way?
NEUT4|I think different parts are going in different directions.
NEUT5|What happened this week was after several weeks in which the stock market seemed to be going only One Direction.
BEAR6|Stock market shuttered and it's not surprising because the stock markets been going like this, and the economy's been going like this.
NEUT7|And so when the stock market is feeling a brilliant, they seem to ignore all the negative sides.
NEUT8|And then they have this dose of reality.
NEUT9|China huge market.
BEAR10|Particularly for Japan there factory sector slowing down Europe.
BEAR11|It's a mess and it's a mess.
NEUT12|Every day a different thing.
BEAR13|I mean there was a horrible series of photographs on the New York Times website of increasing number of young people turning to prostitution.
NEUT14|In order to make ends meet and then the US, we have this really interesting tension.
BULL15|The economy seems to be getting better, but very slowly.
NEUT16|And when Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman says that people say Oh my God, he's going to take away the adrenaline and they panic.
NEUT17|And if all the sudden it's not getting better and he says, well we need more adrenaline because it's not getting better then they panic again.
NEUT18|Well, but there's also a question which I think we're going to explore in some polling this summer of whether there's a new normal here.
NEUT19|Whether people psychology doesn't adjust to improvements in the real economy, even if their modest that.
BULL20|OK, the stock market is booming, the housing slump is over.
BULL21|Employment is actually getting a little better, but I'm not going to.
BEAR22|I'm not going to feel good about it because I've been burned for five straight, absolutely and look.
NEUT23|There's plenty to worry about.
BEAR24|Better is not good.
BEAR25|Yeah, seven and a half percent unemployment for the rest of the year.
NEUT26|That's the forecast.
BEAR27|Wages for most workers have not been going up this loss of confidence that somehow the economy is delivering the goods for the middle class and the next generation is palpable.
NEUT28|And it's not like there's some candidate or policy maker who says I'm going to make it better in here, so I'm going to make it better.
BEAR29|Instead, they're fighting over all this stuff.
NEUT30|I wonder if not so much in terms of the real economy and how real people think, but I wonder if partly what's guiding the uncertainty here is.
NEUT31|I think it's worthwhile acknowledging absolutely uncharted territory in terms of both the length and pace of the recovery, and also the extraordinary measures that central banks around the world that you sort of basically pump things up that no one, no one knows, either.
NEUT32|A what happens when the Fed in Japanese and European stop pumping money into the system.
NEUT33|And perhaps more, only no one knows quite what's going to happen at the moment when they start withdrawing it totally, and that's what you saw this week.
NEUT34|Bernanke said that someday, maybe in the next few meetings were going to withdraw the stimulus in the market starts to go like this.
NEUT35|So this has been an enormous experiment.
NEUT36|An in the sense the first stage was hard, but it was kind of everybody in we have a crisis.
NEUT37|We need to do all this.
NEUT38|The second stage may be more difficult.
NEUT39|There's no playbook for this.
NEUT40|An IT people a little more complacent inside the Fed.
BEAR41|You see this big disagreement starting to pop up.
NEUT42|Make the case of Japan.
NEUT43|Jerry is a bit of an exception.
NEUT44|Japan is one that said OK, after a decade or two of nothing happening, we're going to now join the experiment.
NEUT45|So what's happening there?
BEAR46|They're behind us.
BULL47|"They're kind of doing thing and to my surprise, it actually the early signs are, it seems to be working."""
