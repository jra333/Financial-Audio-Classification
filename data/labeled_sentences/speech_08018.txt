BEAR1|Both say we don't think Kraft Heinz will pursue a hostile and potentially costly tie up, as evidenced by its decision to quickly end its bid for Unilever in 2017 and walk away from a rumored bid for Pinnacle Foods in 2018.

BULL3|International Network stands as a means to aid its sales prospects.

BULL17|Wells Fargo's retail branch structure advisory network product offerings and share in small and medium sized enterprises is difficult to duplicate, ensuring that the company's competitive advantage is maintained.
BULL18|Wells offers the scale advantages of a money center bank without the risks and volatility associated with extensive capital markets operations.
BEAR19|There say Wells has been on defense while its peers have been on offense, potentially damaging the positioning of wells franchises over the long term.
BEAR20|COVID-19 will be devastating for the economy and likely devastating for the banks.
BEAR21|There is no way to know for sure how hard the banks will get hit or how bad things might get the fraudulent account scandal will permanently damage Wells Fargo's Brandon Fracture.
