NEUT0|"""In this video lecture we will look at how to import timeseries data from various web data sources and your local machine."
NEUT1|But before that, let me introduce you to another data structure called the Dataframe.
NEUT2|The underlying idea of a dataframe is based on spreadsheets.
NEUT3|Data frame is a 2 dimensional data structure where the data is stored in a tabular format comprising of rows and columns.
NEUT4|This table is set on a labeled axis.
NEUT5|That is, if you consider the top left corner of the table as the point of origin, then access equals zero for rows and access equals one for columns.
NEUT6|Further, these rows and columns are indexed.
NEUT7|That is, it is possible to find the exact location of any data point within the table.
NEUT8|The size of the table is mutable, and arithmetic operations can be performed on rows and columns.
NEUT9|Further, any particular column of the table can be of different data type from the rest.
NEUT10|For example, in this dataframe the column one consists of employee ID, a string, column, two consists of names of the employees against ring and column three consists of employee salary, which is an integer.
NEUT11|Dataframe is a pandas object and a most commonly used one.
NEUT12|It can be created using the following syntax.
NEUT13|Before creating a dataframe, you obviously need to import the pandas library into your namespace.
NEUT14|Have a look at a few examples on pandas dataframe.
NEUT15|These dataframes are created from lists, dictionaries and arrays.
NEUT16|You can learn more on this in the Ipython notebook of the pandas section.
NEUT17|Usually the financial data that is pulled from various data sources is stored as dataframes online sources to import.
NEUT18|Oh yeah Chelsea data include quandel, IEX, Finance and Yahoo finance.
NEUT19|For Indian stocks data you can use NSE pie.
NEUT20|Now let us understand the code that can be used to import data from Yahoo Finance.
NEUT21|In the first line we import the library pandas next from the pandas Datareader library.
NEUT22|We import the module data.
NEUT23|Next we have imported fix Yahoo finance package.
NEUT24|We will further use the PDR dot get data Yahoo function to store the required data in our data frame.
NEUT25|The first five lines of the Dataframe DF is printed using the head function.
NEUT26|Another way to work with financial data is to upload a CSV file and save it as a dataframe.
NEUT27|Use pandas dot read CSV function and input the CSV final path to it as done here.
NEUT28|The first five rows of the Dataframe and V is printed using the head function.
NEUT29|"In the upcoming Ipython notebook, we will further discuss how to import time series data from other web data sources such as Quandel."""
