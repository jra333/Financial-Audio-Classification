NEUT0|"""Tesla's on deck Jerrod Blicker."
NEUT1|What are they reporting?
NEUT2|That's right.
BEAR3|Tesla is down 6% and it was a big mess on the bottom line.
NEUT4|So here are the numbers on the top line.
NEUT5|Revenue came in at a beat 10.74 billion.
NEUT6|The estimate was for lower at 10.38 billion, but the headline number here.
NEUT7|Fourth quarter adjusted EPS coming in at $0.80.
BULL8|The estimate was for 23 cents higher dollar 03.
NEUT9|A couple notes here.
BULL10|Their free cash flow position is excellent.
NEUT11|They finished with 1.87 billion.
BEAR12|In the quarter, the estimate was for much lower 1.04 billion.
BULL13|They are seeing their CapEx increase.
NEUT14|Here came in at 1.15 billion.
BEAR15|Estimate was for lower at 969.9 million and I think it's that those spending outlays that may be weighing on the stock.
BULL16|Right now, they're actually ramping up quite quickly.
BULL17|They want to get to a 50% average annual growth rate in vehicle sales over the coming years, and that's going to take a lot of cash.
NEUT18|Also, semi deliveries will be again in 2021.
NEUT19|That's another line from.
NEUT20|The earnings release here, and also they're going to be building out their Berlin factory as planned.
BEAR21|So in early trading here after the report where we had that big miss on their bottom line and adjusted EPS stock is down about four and a half percent guys cheered.
BULL22|I'm curious what you make of the stocks reaction because outside of adjusted earnings per share where they did miss, it looks like a pretty solid report coming from Tesla first time that the company is reported revenue above 10 billion.
NEUT23|Do you think that this is just a reflection of the fact?
NEUT24|But the stock has come so far so fast and analysts were almost or not analysts, investors.
NEUT25|Shareholders were almost ready to sell.
NEUT26|If there is anything in this report that disappointed.
NEUT27|I think so.
NEUT28|We use the term and a lot on this on these programs price to perfection and I think that was the case with Tesla stock and also it came on.
BEAR29|These earnings reports are coming on the heels of a bad day in the markets.
BEAR30|I mean we were down the most are down the most in about 3 months here and you put it all together.
NEUT31|Yeah investors were taking money off the table over the last couple of days and probably going to see some more of that tomorrow.
NEUT32|So we'll have to see how all of this shakes out.
BULL33|Especially pay attention to the earnings call, but some of these stocks and especially Tesla have grown.
BULL34|And come so far so fast that anything slight anything short of stellar results.
BEAR35|Probably going to lead to a deeper sell off here.
NEUT36|Following this though, why all of a sudden are the investors have been willing to give Tesla a pass for months and months and quarters in quarters.
NEUT37|Now, not giving them the pass, although the stock is still up.
NEUT38|I mean, when you look at where it's been since December and since it got put into the S&P 500, it's still up huge.
NEUT39|Yeah, let's take a look at the Wi-Fi Interactive where I have a couple charts here.
BULL40|Now this is going to be Tesla over the trailing year up 674%.
NEUT41|Yes, that's an amazing run, so I'm not too worried yet and this is only a few minutes after the report.
BEAR42|"What's going to count tomorrow is when the market opens an where it settles, but if we are in fact entering a slight correction phase in the general markets, you can bet that some of these high Flyers are going to be sold off the most here guys."""
