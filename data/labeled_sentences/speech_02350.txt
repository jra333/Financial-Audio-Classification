NEUT9|Right now we have not looked at this one before.
NEUT10|Disney doesn't have support levels down here as well.
NEUT11|9755 and 9685.
NEUT12|I know that there's intraday trades here an intraday levels, but these are gonna be the levels I currently watch.
NEUT13|Watch for the break in $99 or breaking that $99.
NEUT14|You guys will get a rally off of that watching for the first break in the 10 day simple moving average which is currently at 9842 followed by the 20 day at the 9899.
NEUT15|Very close to 99, which is why I put that into 99 that could have been brought down a little bit lower to that 9888, but I figured make it 99 making a nice even now.
NEUT16|Number 97597 fifty five support level that doesn't hold 9685 will follow up behind that.
NEUT17|Little stagnant, not too sure which way it wants to go, but if you guys end up going below ninety 755, you could tap down to that 9685 area, which we've seen very close very, very close to happening today.
BEAR18|In today's low was 9689, so very close to that very close to it.
NEUT19|Just four cents off, alright.
NEUT20|Watching for the break of 99 to put you guys back into the Bulls territory.
NEUT21|The rally mode in my opinion 1027 this current date.
NEUT22|9779 we're going to have our resistance levels at 98, even followed up by.
BULL23|9842 followed up by the $99 support levels down here as well.
NEUT24|At 9755 and 9685.
BULL25|Going to support levels right now for Disney that we're going to be watching.
NEUT26|And watching for the bullish break of 99.
NEUT27|Alright, so 9685 is going to be mostly watch for the watch for the breakout and $99.00 that's going to bullish.
