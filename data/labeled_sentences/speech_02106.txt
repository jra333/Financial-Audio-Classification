NEUT2|Let's see.
NEUT3|So based on technical analysis as we can see in front of us, have already drawn at the Pride major trend and the trend of Coca Cola is a trendless trained or over sideways trained.
BEAR4|Sorry auto endless or sideways trend.
NEUT5|So meaning that the prices are moving inside a channel.
NEUT6|The blue line is the major trend already drawn.
NEUT7|The major tend to make it clear and easier to understand the price.
NEUT8|The price is moment for everybody.
NEUT9|Include including myself so it looks easy for me to see where the prices are moving where they're going.
NEUT10|So first of all, is usually just please taking analysis.
NEUT11|It's only one of the tools available that we know that we should use to predict next price step.
NEUT12|So next price movement or to forecast the prices.
NEUT13|We should always use fundamental analysis and we need to combine both fundamental and technical analysis to get.
NEUT14|Confidence to get as much confidence as possible in this stock or in all the stocks that we would like to invest so.
NEUT15|Coca Cola is we can see it's moving in a sideways trend sort endless condition where it means that the idea is that the prices are moving inside this channel and what's gonna happen next.
NEUT16|So because the price is close to the top but resistance line or 49 U.S. dollar India is data.
NEUT17|If Visa 49 U.S. dollar level will be broken that is to go long after this target price of 55 U.S. dollar target price was easily found just projecting the depth.
NEUT18|Of the high or the height of these rectangular shape from the from the breakout point of the price is older.
NEUT19|The price there is an opportunity to the bottom or the top top situation.
NEUT20|Ideas to go short and again there by service again.
NEUT21|Overs over oversold the bottom of the channels that is to go long and again here because the prices was in over Bolt so the price can keep really.
NEUT22|Going down before going up again, so and again and below this video, there are some fundamental news around Coca Cola.
