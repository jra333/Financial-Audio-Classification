NEUT0|"""Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke announced earlier today that the Fed will continue its $85 billion a month bond buying program otherwise known as quantitative easing."
NEUT1|It's a form of money printing.
NEUT2|What does one critic of the Federal Reserve System think of this news?
BULL3|Joining us now, we're very privileged to have Doctor Ron Paul format twelve term Texas Congressman, presidential candidate and author of Quote, the School Revolution 8 new answer to our Broken Education system.
BULL4|Thank you very much for being here, so thank you, Reddit.
NEUT5|Is this money printing programme continuation?
BEAR6|The right thing I, I think it's the wrong thing to do, but I'm not surprised there continued to do it, but I think it should be bad news.
BEAR7|Not good news.
NEUT8|Of course I think the markets in a way thought it was good news because I believe afterwards you know the stocks went up and the market is going high is basically there, right?
NEUT9|So if they've said, well, we're going to take her 10 billion only $75 billion per month.
NEUT10|The markets would have been panic.
NEUT11|I would think that this message.
NEUT12|They should get even by not tapering is that it's bad news anyway, because that means the feds worried after all this time and all this money trillions of dollars and they're still saying, well, you know we got these good statistics, but they're not for real.
BEAR13|I think the unemployment statistics are much worse than they admit to.
NEUT14|If you look at, you know the percentage of people who are under the under employed and unemployed or 5960% people under over 600 V actual number of people in the in the jobs market.
NEUT15|People actually actively looking for jobs.
NEUT16|Is a lot lower than what could the Fed be doing in your view?
NEUT17|Could could the Fed be you know doing more should it be doing?
NEUT18|I mean what is the answer?
BEAR19|Clearly this is an economic malaise.
NEUT20|We know that if you're a planner and you think the government or the Fed can do this and manipulate it, I guess you can pick and choose.
NEUT21|You might as well flip a coin, but you know, coming from the viewpoint.
NEUT22|Of mine, it's the more you print, the bigger the bubble and there still bubbles out.
NEUT23|There is a bond bubble.
BEAR24|There's problems out there.
BEAR25|So if you continue the process, yes, you might feel better and that it always feels better when they when they get their drugs so they feel better, but it's it's going to make the problem worse in the long run.
NEUT26|What one of the things that the Fed was looking at?
BULL27|We saw mortgage rates have gone up quite dramatically this year, but from about 3 three point 4% to 4.6%.
BEAR28|Broadly speaking, which was a massive jump in monthly payments for anyone wanting.
BEAR29|To buy a home and we're seeing you know the number of mortgage applications go down and housing was a strength.
NEUT30|Does that trap the Fed into this forever?
NEUT31|They probably think about those things, they're planners, and they think they're all powerful and they either want to purposely deceive us, or they decieve themselves that there's no inflation on prices.
BEAR32|I think price inflation is out there.
BEAR33|The cost of living is going up much faster than people who are making a ways their real wages, you know, go down.
NEUT34|They've been going down for many, many decades now.
NEUT35|So I think they decieve themselves they must come around to believing that there's no inflation in the economy is a little weak.
NEUT36|So let's just keep keep doing this, but they're very naive to believe that if the problem came from when they used to talk about Greenspan, he kept interest rates too low, too long.
NEUT37|So what they do is my Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Alan Greenspan.
BEAR38|Since Bernanke is been in, he took him even lower.
NEUT39|Who could believe you could take him even lower, and sometimes it's below.
NEUT40|Zero because there because of the inflation rate.
BEAR41|So very very low it can't solve the problem.
NEUT42|It is the problem now turning from from the Fed now to another part of Washington up budget.
NEUT43|Let's listen to President Obama talking about possible government shutdown.
NEUT44|"Let's listen."""
