NEUT0|"""This Xbox remember."
NEUT1|Now this is the Handbook for Technical analysis.
NEUT2|It has absolutely everything you ever want to know about technical analysis, but what's comprehensive about this is that every strategy you've ever heard of is in this.
NEUT3|It gives you a broad overview, and it's really simple to understand to look at to dip into.
NEUT4|It says trading system development is part art, part science and part common sense.
BULL5|Our goal is not to develop a system that achieves the highest returns using historical data, but to formulate a sound concept that has performed reasonably well in the past and could be expected to continue to perform reasonably well in the future.
NEUT6|Firstly, that technical analysis is something that you really need to study.
NEUT7|Secondly, you have to understand that not all systems are perfect.
NEUT8|You have to choose one that suits you.
NEUT9|Thirdly, this book tells you to trade without emotion, understand the levels you want to enter the trade, the levels you want to exit the trade and stick to your plan.
NEUT10|"It will search me."""
