NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Will Apple now, down at a very interesting level, as far as the tunnel chart is concerned, and as I put this line in place, let me just preface this by saying in no way am I trying to imply that this is some sort of great discovery or some sort of special talent that I have.
NEUT4|I assure you, people that you start to understand charts are going to be watching this level, and I make all those comments because when a lot of people are watching the same level and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy called whatever you want, it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT5|And that's what we have with the 119 mark.
NEUT6|I mean, going through the history of the.
NEUT7|In fact, I'm actually curious.
NEUT8|What did it come up?
BULL9|Yeah, it came up even one more time.
NEUT10|So you look down here and you can see 119 acted as support acted as support, support, support, support and even today acted as support.
BEAR11|So my point here is that it's not guaranteed to hold a support, but if the price were to come down in that area and actually break down through there that break in and of itself could very well create quite a bit of downward selling pressure, because that would be a very historic level.
NEUT12|That is all of a sudden been broken.
BULL13|But on the same token, it's a more than valid.
NEUT14|It's a more than irrational thoughts.
NEUT15|Have that you know what if the price comes on here?
BEAR16|I think it could potentially bounce.
NEUT17|That doesn't mean it's for sure going to happen, but I anybody could say, OK, that's a rational thought to have.
NEUT18|By no means is it random for you to say you think it could bounce up from 119, so definitely a lot of eyeballs will be watching that level.
NEUT19|In the event the price breaks down below it.
NEUT20|Next, key area of support at that point would then be down there right around the one 1750 mark.
NEUT21|If the price does bounce off it and starts to work its way back upwards.
NEUT22|First the level of resistance to watch is going to be the Purple line right there.
NEUT23|The 50.
NEUT24|Moving average and then after that that pink line up there.
NEUT25|That 200.
NEUT26|Moving average.
NEUT27|So watch those couple of levels in the event.
NEUT28|Like I said, there is some sort of upward movement, but as right now, yeah I think all eyeballs going to be watching that 119 mark.
NEUT29|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR35|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
