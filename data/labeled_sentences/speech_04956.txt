BULL0|"""EPS of $4.23 versus expectations of $4.62, revenue 69.98 billion."
NEUT1|The street was at 68.8 billion, turning head to that Q4 guidance there are going between 80 and 86.5 billion.
BULL2|That is light versus expectations.
NEUT3|The street was at around 87.4 billion, a WS revenue, 9 billion, about 35%.
NEUT4|Guys back to you.
BULL5|OK, thanks so much Josh.
BULL6|35% AWS comparing to Azure yesterday.
BEAR7|60% year over year growth but Mike were clearly revenue, essentially inline big EPS miss.
NEUT8|Yeah maybe the revenue guide there a little bit soft as well.
NEUT9|Just driving down.
NEUT10|I think the revenue guide is the eye catching thing now.
NEUT11|The backdrop is the line forever has been.
NEUT12|Amazon is usually pretty conservative about guiding revenue and in fact it's a ridiculously wide span.
NEUT13|If you think about it, $6 billion were already a month into the quarter that they're now guiding.
BEAR14|So to me, that's not that's not a positive for serving a WS decelerating and missing on the top line is probably also weighing on the stock.
NEUT15|Tim.
NEUT16|Your initial take on the numbers that we're getting here.
BULL17|Three 5% growth for a WS.
NEUT18|Do you think?
NEUT19|Ultimately it will be good enough?
BULL20|Well, I think there are a lot of businesses out there that would love to have 35% growth, so maybe it's a case where expectations got a little high.
NEUT21|However, a WS is the cash cow that continues to fund the rest of Amazon's growth and low margin businesses.
BEAR22|So at the end of the day, they're going to need to start showing some earnings, and this is clearly a margin compression that we have to look into.
NEUT23|Mike, I know we don't typically focus so much on the bottom line with this stock, but after 1/4 of we work, our report of those types of issues does that start to be more of a factor for them or they still many years away from having to have a reasonable P multiple?
BULL24|I think they've shown that on a cash flow basis they can dial it up and down enough that there's not a concern that the model itself is broken.
NEUT25|It's about pace of investment and things like that, so I don't think it's really about the EPS miss as much as it is, you know, a WS kind of maxed out is that now much more competitive.
NEUT26|"Market and that changes the complexion, also changes the multiple the market is willing to assign implicitly to the cloud business inside of Amazon."""
