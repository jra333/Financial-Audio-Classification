NEUT0|"""So at the outset, the President of the United States is the last person in the world who could want or a platform."
NEUT1|But recall that free speech isn't speech free from consequences.
NEUT2|It means speech free from government consequences.
NEUT3|And here it's a government speaker who who is the actor.
NEUT4|So when digital services take content offline that they regard is inciting violence and thereby violating their terms of service, they are exercising their own speech rights.
NEUT5|In saying we don't want our users and the public at large.
BEAR6|The affected by this content which violates our policies and arguably law digital services, have taken action against the inflammatory rhetoric in the past, particularly when it violated their policies against misleading the users or or otherwise creating content that was inconsistent with what the President as a user of the service that committed to abide by.
NEUT7|There's a very deep policy conversation we can have about how deep into the technological stack content, moderation policies like these should be implemented, but I don't think there's any question that if you make a commitment to abide by certain rules when you enter into a contract that the other party can say, hey, you've breached that commitment and terminate the service, and so that includes an Internet user.
NEUT8|It also includes an app.
NEUT9|"It allows its users to to incite violence or otherwise engage in in behavior they committed not to."""
