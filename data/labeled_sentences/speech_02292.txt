NEUT0|"""Good morning, 9:23 AM Pacific Standard Time today's Date 68 2013 what do we have?"
BEAR1|A massive bull rally trade in Amazon.com.
NEUT2|What I'm going to show is that these key daily moving averages, particularly the red line, is the 50 day we bounced.
BULL3|They gapped it up Friday and we came right back up here where the last two major daily reversals were and we got a higher high.
NEUT4|Just let me.
NEUT5|Show to everyone what I'm talking about on a 60 minute level.
NEUT6|On a 60 minute level chart.
NEUT7|You can clearly see where at 271 on the low where that 60 minute bam went straight up.
BEAR8|And I'm sorry this is a 30 minute chart on the 30 minute chart we hit that support level over here and we went straight up to the high.
NEUT9|Now on a 30 minute chart you can see where that rally started soon as that thing hit $280.
BEAR10|It dropped like a rock and it pulled back $5 up at the Inner day high.
NEUT11|That means we're going to use the $280 put starting Monday.
NEUT12|We're going to take a look and see how the next counter move would come up to a lower high.
NEUT13|That's a 30 minute.
NEUT14|Here is the 60 minute.
NEUT15|60 minute you can see clearly the cell.
NEUT16|Where we would short.
NEUT17|That's where the $280 put comes into play.
NEUT18|We would buy the dip.
BEAR19|The dip would be the $270 called down here.
NEUT20|That's where the calls were bought.
NEUT21|What we will be looking at come Monday is now that Amazon made that high over there is is that on the daily chart.
NEUT22|We can all see right over here.
NEUT23|That back when we had post earnings.
NEUT24|In the last quarter.
NEUT25|We made these triple tops and then immediately we had sell programs hip to stock.
NEUT26|This is all price volatility, price volatility and all of the high beta.
NEUT27|NASDAQ 100 will be here throughout the summer time.
NEUT28|They're not leaving.
NEUT29|That means that both directions for the bull and the bear both make money.
NEUT30|That's the bottom line.
NEUT31|The next thing is the trade management will be to see if that wall of resistance here on the $280 mark going back to.
NEUT32|A 15 minute chart you can see on a 15 minute move.
NEUT33|What a rally that was on Friday, but then immediately the sellers got control.
BULL34|Sellers got control, get buyers were here so we got a $10 range an Amazon.
NEUT35|I'll see everyone on Monday.
NEUT36|It's a bull run and it has bear reversals.
NEUT37|"The 60 minute chart tells us everything that's the last high that's going to be the near term wall of resistance."""
