NEUT0|"""Another position that they brought to my attention my Discord Group brought to my attention is this position position SJ."
BULL1|You can see that this did have a massive increase as well to where it did end up decreasing.
BULL2|Still up 30% thirty 3%.
BULL3|But it was up quite a bit before this kind of massive sell off.
BULL4|Here it was a slow moving sell off throughout the rest of the day, but you can see that it rose up to $18.00 from, you know, an opening of $15 up to $18.00.
BEAR5|After that decrease down to a low of $12.12.
NEUT6|You could have made about $6 over $6 worth of profit here per share that you buy, which would have been huge.
NEUT7|So for all the people that got in there, hopefully you did end up getting out before everything turned against you, because right now it's below where they are.
NEUT8|It's close to where the lowest, but if you got your profit then congratulations and thanks to the Discord Group from bringing this to my attention.
