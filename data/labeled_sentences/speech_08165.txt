BEAR0|"""Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell made a major speech the other day that will spell big trouble down the road."
NEUT1|What does this mean to you?
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to help navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT3|Jerome Powell, the boss of the Federal Reserve, delivered a virtue addressed a few days ago where he announced a big change in how our central bank will conduct monetary policy.
BEAR4|The consequences will be ugly.
NEUT5|Not today, but sometime in the future.
BULL6|Previously, the Fed said the goal of its operations was to achieve 2% inflation, that is, prices going up 2% a year.
BULL7|The Fed believe that such a level of inflation would give us a growing economy with low unemployment.
BEAR8|Our central bank has been lamenting that by the ways we measure, inflation is still has to achieve its goal.
NEUT9|So going forward, Chairman Powell announced that the central bank would allow inflation to go above 2% as long as they long term average is 2%.
BEAR10|Oh, this is destructive nonsense.
NEUT11|First, despite with the Fed believes there is no correlation between inflation and unemployment.
NEUT12|Real World experience has shown this idea is wrong.
NEUT13|At least 7 Nobel Prize winning economists have debunked it.
NEUT14|It is holy writ within the Fed.
BULL15|Thus, Jerome Powell's desire to shoot for a higher rate of inflation to stimulate our covid hit economy.
NEUT16|What power is telling the world was in the future when inflation rises up more than 2%, the federal letter trip for awhile before taking actions to stop it?
NEUT17|What are they inhaling inside the Fed?
NEUT18|Let's get real.
BULL19|Percent inflation, which the Fed desires, means that if you make $50,000 a year, the cost of living will go up $1000.
NEUT20|So how does making a typical household spend an extra $1000 to buy the same stuff?
NEUT21|Stimulate the economy as experience repeatedly shows?
BEAR22|High inflation will also damage stocks.
NEUT23|How to smashing the real value of stocks?
NEUT24|Help people with 401K's, and I raise the whole thing is preposterous.
NEUT25|We should have learned this from what happened to us in the 1970s.
BEAR26|When we had both high inflation and a stagnant economy, nonetheless, the Federal Reserve may give us a repeat down the road as its new goal could well lead it to print too much money.
BEAR27|The rising price of gold is a warning that this may happen.
NEUT28|Gold doesn't go up unless there's too much money being created, as experience indicates, inflation can't be controlled like a thermostat.
NEUT29|the Fed should junk this bad idea once and for all.
NEUT30|Don't try to create inflation.
NEUT31|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT32|Thank you for listening to send us your comments and suggestions.
BULL33|"I look forward to being with you soon again."""
