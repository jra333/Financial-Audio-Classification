BULL0|"""Alright, hello everyone and welcome to the daily forecast today."
NEUT1|Let's jump straight in it in a second.
NEUT2|If you're new guy, check out the website in the video description.
NEUT3|There's lots of chat rooms and channels and full cast you can follow on the link in the video description, right.
NEUT4|So let's just have a look.
NEUT5|Let's zoom in.
NEUT6|So funny opening.
BEAR7|We have broke downwards.
NEUT8|We had this.
NEUT9|Upwards line, which is here.
BULL10|Hopefully we we get downwards and broke that straight away and that's what we've been seeing.
NEUT11|Since then, which is the downward move that are predicted on the weekly forecast, which then should give us a main target of?
NEUT12|1710 I said it was a safety profit, but we should come down to this sort of line, which is the two red lines somewhere in between, then, which also gives us the middle of this wedge pattern that broke on a higher time frame.
NEUT13|So what I expect to happen today.
NEUT14|Is more than once movement.
NEUT15|We have this horizontal support on the smaller time frames to breakthrough and we also have this upwards.
NEUT16|Resistance to breakthrough which is.
NEUT17|When we go to the higher timeframes.
NEUT18|Which is coming from this angle.
NEUT19|In my opinion.
NEUT20|We've had this before.
NEUT21|And that is what we are seeing at the moment.
NEUT22|So that one might hold if we are going upwards.
NEUT23|From here on, the longer term higher timeframes.
NEUT24|But we will evaluate that as it comes down.
NEUT25|So the next main thing to lookout for is these two lines to break.
NEUT26|So want to break start.
NEUT27|We should be about.
NEUT28|23, Seventeen, 23 and then you should be safe for a sale.
BEAR29|Down towards 1710.
NEUT30|I got that wrong.
NEUT31|I said once you see these two lines broken, so around 1723, seventeen, 22 you should be in a safe cell down towards 1710.
NEUT32|You also have this horizontal line to get past.
NEUT33|Which is why I put 1720's take profit today.
NEUT34|But once you pass there that then you are in a short sale to 1710.
NEUT35|So there's things to watch out for.
NEUT36|There is a full cast for today.
NEUT37|I'll be back again later for the Asian session for another video.
NEUT38|And it is moving slowly today because of the US holiday, which is happening today.
NEUT39|Memorial Day.

NEUT41|Have a good day and I'll see you again in the next video.
NEUT42|"Take care."""
