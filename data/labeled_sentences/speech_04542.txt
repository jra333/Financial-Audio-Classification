NEUT0|"""Well, I guess I I wouldn't use the term stretched but alright, so taking a step back you look at the NASDAQ 100 so we said alright, it's the end for large cap growth."
NEUT1|These stocks are done.
NEUT2|Nobody wants anything to do with them.
BULL3|Now you have 85% of the NASDAQ 100 back above the 200 day, which is phenomenal.
NEUT4|Like in any market environment and that number was under 60% just a couple of weeks ago.
NEUT5|Is that entire narrative?
NEUT6|You can now throw in the garbage.
NEUT7|Take a look at Facebook, Microsoft, Google making new highs.
BULL8|Amazon's coming back, it's up like 75 points today.
BEAR9|Heavy drip in Amazon apples, Bustin loose set of prior range Invidia and some of the large cap chip names are running so that whole narrative is gone and now large cap growth.
NEUT10|Specifically tech communications helping the average is at least maintain where they've gotten too.
NEUT11|And then you look at the S&P.
BEAR12|95% of S&P 500 stocks are now above their 200 day moving average, and most of those 200 day Ma's are rising 200 day Ma's.
NEUT13|And that is insane in terms of participation in a bull market now.
NEUT14|Depending on what and who you are, there are two ways to interpret that.
NEUT15|One way is to say it's Goldilocks.
BULL16|It's as good as it gets.
NEUT17|Take some off the table.
NEUT18|It can't be this good for too long.
NEUT19|I think that's reasonable, but another way to look at that is really that's the type of market you want to be short.
NEUT20|Like, seriously, like what's wrong with you almost, so that's kind of where I am is right in the middle.
NEUT21|I can understand the push and pull of these levels, but my instinct tells me these things got hired to go.
BULL22|Even if we have to correct in the short term, so that's where I am emotionally well.
NEUT23|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT24|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
