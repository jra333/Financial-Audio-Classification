NEUT0|"""So what happened to Romeo Power after you've seen that large increase?"
NEUT1|What happened to Romeo Power?
NEUT2|The reason why I did have that increase was because of the fact that they did have that battery supply.
BULL3|The battery deal with a truck maker, which was great news for the company.
BULL4|It did end up increasing the $13.64 an the after hours market in pre market.
BEAR5|It decreased quite a bit.
BEAR6|But you can see like towards the beginning of the day it did decrease and then did increase to where I bought in.
BEAR7|Somewhere around here 11:50 I believe it did increase and then fell all the way back down to $10.31 where it currently stands at $10.49.
NEUT8|But we can say that this is really something that adapted to the market 'cause the market was really down today and it wasn't something that was just based on people selling off.
NEUT9|Yes there was a portion of it, but people have a lot of buying power.
BEAR10|It's just the fact that it was selling off today which scares people into not buying.
BULL11|"So they weren't making that by in this position, but it is a great position or really solid."""
