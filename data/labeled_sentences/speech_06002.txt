BEAR0|"""Welcome to Trading Nation on Michelle Caruso, Cabrera and let's take a look at shares of Facebook plunging on Tuesday for a second straight session."
BEAR1|Off by more than 3%.
BEAR2|This is the company faces massive scrutiny and a federal probe around privacy concerns.
NEUT3|So should you try and catch the Facebook falling knife?
NEUT4|Matt Meili is with Miller.
NEUT5|Tabak bore Schlossberg is with BK Asset management force.
NEUT6|What's your take on Facebook here so you know, I'm really of two minds about this right now.
NEUT7|The stock right now is no doubt radioactive.
BEAR8|And I think it probably faces tremendous amount of headwinds as we go forward, both from regulatory oversight and actually from their core business.
BEAR9|Because if you look at Facebook from just a core business point of view, its growth amongst Millennials has really slowed.
NEUT10|An millennials are going to find this whole story toxic the brand, on the other hand, Facebook is much more than just Facebook.
NEUT11|It's also Instagram an WhatsApp.
BULL12|So I think as a portfolio on a longer term basis, the company is tremendously valuable, and I think eventually it's going to become a tremendously good value.
NEUT13|But right now, I would definitely stay away because the risks are still not fully known.
NEUT14|OK, so that's the fundamental.
NEUT15|Take Matt.
NEUT16|What are you seeing in the charts?
BEAR17|Well, it's kind of interesting here, because the stock is obviously gotten buried the last couple of days and it is broken.
NEUT18|A key support level.
BEAR19|Basically it's February lows, but that's also where the neckline of a head and shoulders formation comes in, as broken significantly below that neckline, so that's that's a problem.
BULL20|However, if you look at the volume and it's not just today's volume, which is over 100,000,000 shares, we still got a ways to go, but it was up near 100,000,000 shares yesterday.
NEUT21|I went back since the IPO we can't find 2 days in a row.
NEUT22|We see that kind of big volume.
NEUT23|So on a very short term basis, it looks like the stock might be getting washed out, so you might see a little bit of a bounce here my thing and I agree with Boris, is that a fundamental side.
NEUT24|It's a dicey thing, so I wouldn't want to say we want to buy this on.
NEUT25|We just in fact I'd want to sell it on the next train on any kind of bounce.
BULL26|The key is, can it regain that neckline up near the one 71172 level?
BEAR27|If it can do that, then it's going to be OK, but it just seems to be a lot of headwinds out there and a lot of unknowns out there.
NEUT28|What's going to happen next?
NEUT29|So?
NEUT30|But my point is, you may want don't want to dump the stock here.
NEUT31|Look for a little bit of a bounce, but it may not last too long.
NEUT32|Got it, why is it that green line Michelle?
NEUT33|I think it's going to be weeks, perhaps even months before we get a lot more clarity on this story.
NEUT34|That's why I agree that it's selling it into strength.
NEUT35|Is a much better trade than trying to buy it on weakness.
NEUT36|Got it.
