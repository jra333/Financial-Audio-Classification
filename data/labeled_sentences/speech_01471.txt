NEUT0|"""So Sarah, what we're looking at right now, specifically with regard to the Berkshire filing, is the focus on financials."
NEUT1|We know that's a huge part of the Berkshire portfolio, so let's take you through some of these highlights here.
BEAR2|We've got seemingly large reductions in many of the financial Holdings here.
BULL3|So far.
BEAR4|It turns out that there's been a 27% reduction of quartering of the Wells Fargo stake.
BEAR5|Also, a 62% reduction in the Berkshire stake in JP Morgan.
BEAR6|A 42% reduction in shares of PNC Financial.
BEAR7|A 9% reduction in their stake in BNY Mellon and also, it looks like a dissolution right now of their stake in Goldman Sachs, where we're continuing to go through some of these right now.
NEUT8|We've also noticed, aside from the financials, perhaps a new stake in Barrick Gold, we're going to take a look at that as well.
NEUT9|But for right now, the focus on financials.
BEAR10|Big right now, it seems as though there's been a reduction in the shares over there.
NEUT11|Remember, we've also heard earlier after the deadline for this.
BULL12|13 If that more recently, there's been an increase in the stake of Bank of America for Berkshire Hathaway so.
BEAR13|"Again, will continue to comb through this, but for right now of big reduction in shares of Wells Fargo, PNC Financial, JP Morgan, BNY Mellon, also Goldman Sachs as well for right now will send things back over to you guys."""
