NEUT0|"""Let's talk about Apple now, preparing to officially announce."
NEUT1|According to our reporting, putting its own chips in Mac computers.
NEUT2|Launching this Mac trade in program.
NEUT3|Obviously there's a lot of demand for devices for computers right now.
NEUT4|How does that impact your outlook on Apple?
NEUT5|Yeah, and we can talk obviously about Muscatel Saudis now.
NEUT6|We gave the storm.
BULL7|I think when you look what cook and Apple have done, it's really one for the history books for Apple and it's helped them navigate through the services business.
NEUT8|That's really been the rock Gibraltar for them.
NEUT9|But now in the drum roll into iPhone 12 into 5G supercycle and of course in the chip side, more and more ownership of their devices.
NEUT10|And that's something you're going to see vertically continued for.
NEUT11|Are Apple and this is really what I believe is going to be.
NEUT12|The next leg of this growth story, which is why I believe this is a stock to topsy.
NEUT13|Navigated by think a year from now.
NEUT14|This stock as a four in front of it.
BEAR15|That said, there are a lot of people around the world hurting right now, unemployment is high in the economy is officially in a recession.
NEUT16|How does that impact the demand for $1000 plus phones?
NEUT17|And you know very expensive computers.
NEUT18|Yeah, and it clearly does not something that in the street started factoring with numbers, and that's very important because numbers have come down.
BULL19|There was a iPhone units anywhere from 15 to 17%, but but I believe now when you start to look at the SC, the lower price phone which is gaining a lot of strength especially you know, added China.
NEUT20|So that's going to be key right now because even though some of the demand cuts will happen, just given the soft backdrop come down to the pure numbers at the streets focused on.
BEAR21|350,000,000 of the 950,000,000 iPhones worldwide have not upgraded their phones in 3 1/2 years.
BEAR22|So massive pent up demand going into next year and a half.
NEUT23|And that's going to be the next key for Apple to monetize that, especially with this product cycle coming later this year.
NEUT24|Now just how big do you think Apple can get in terms of, you know the market high mean?
NEUT25|I remember reporting here as Apple was approaching that $1 trillion market cap.
BEAR26|You're looking ahead to a $2 trillion market cap and yet we're facing all of this uncertainty despite the uncertainty.
NEUT27|What makes you think that Apple can get there?
NEUT28|And how soon?
NEUT29|Sure, it's really just wrong that have gotten stronger.
NEUT30|If you could Apple, the key piece of services we believe services business is worth between 5 and 600 billion.
NEUT31|Then you look at the next piece in terms of obviously the core iconic iPhone franchise.
NEUT32|That's something where there's going to be further monetization of.
NEUT33|That especially also even tangential in the air pod side, we 85 million units this year versus 65 million last year.
NEUT34|I go out a year.
NEUT35|I think the year or earlier.
NEUT36|This is a $2 trillion market cap and I think Apple is 1.
NEUT37|The stock continues to get re rated and even though investors the haters scratched their head, it comes down to a pure rereading.
NEUT38|"Of Apple stock."""
