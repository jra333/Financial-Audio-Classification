NEUT0|"""Uhm?"
NEUT1|Otero said what's up with Facebook still feeling confident about them?
NEUT2|Yes, you better believe it.
NEUT3|Alright, remember to see if y'all taking my course Facebook last year they disapprove in December.
NEUT4|They approve an additional 5.
NEUT5|I think it was $5 billion and buy back.
BULL6|Alright, So what that means is that they're going to be buying back their shares more shares at those cheaper prices, because right now so undervalued.
NEUT7|Alright, you gotta understand that Facebook owns Instagram.
NEUT8|OK, and he's just not trying to monetize Instagram.
NEUT9|Facebook owns the world largest messaging app.
NEUT10|WhatsApp alright Facebook basically guys, I'm telling you their position to really be in what they already are.
NEUT11|Pretty much a monopoly in his whole social media space.
NEUT12|Snapchat, what happened to him?
NEUT13|OK, you look at their stock price.
NEUT14|Look at what happened.
NEUT15|Nobody can go up against these guys there to bully on the block.
NEUT16|They just need to go through their hard times there set.
NEUT17|Best, that's what you see and I'm going through right now.
NEUT18|This is from a business standpoint.
NEUT19|Is a good time to buy and what you'll see is they're going to make the changes.
NEUT20|This is what Amazon did 7-8 years ago.
BEAR21|All right, they got talked about profitability all messed up.
NEUT22|Having Netflix, it happens.
NEUT23|All the best companies go back and look at Apple, Microsoft do your homework OK, do your history and you'll see this common trend.
NEUT24|But that's what Facebook is going through.
NEUT25|They got breached, things happen negativity but guess what?
NEUT26|What the what the owner the company is doing putting out the fires out?
NEUT27|Paying to get the security around up the platform?
NEUT28|Still innovating, and that's what it's all about.
NEUT29|Gathering creatures of habit.
NEUT30|Facebook basically still owns a majority of our life guy.
NEUT31|They got it last 10-15 years and they got a lot information and nobody is going to match that 2 billion people.
NEUT32|"Trust me, it's all about all right."""
