BULL1|I hope you having a great day and a great week.
NEUT2|Just giving you a quick quick update here.
BULL3|So as I said over the weekend we got we got basically three big companies that were reporting earnings today actually and that is Disney.
NEUT4|McDonald's and beyond meat.
NEUT5|I actually never took a position and beyond me I am watching them, but they're just the revenues are just just super tiny and they already kind of had a lot of.
BEAR6|Hype built into their shares, but Disney reported today an absolutely surged.
NEUT7|About 12% of their shares popped today.
NEUT8|And then McDonald's didn't really seem to do much there.
BULL9|But basically, you know the combination of Pfizer reporting the vaccine with 90% effectiveness, I'm sure helped Disney somewhat.
BEAR10|Even Disney had talked about how they're going to have to furlough some more employees.
BEAR11|I'm sure there's going to be some more pain there, but what happens today is, it looks like a lot of the recovery stocks really appear to have jumped that haven't really done anything since March, so seven months ago and then a lot of the.
BEAR12|A lot of the other high tech tech stocks have gone down, which my.
NEUT13|Observation of this folks is that is that it's normal, and if there's things that you that you like, you know some of the opportunities that I really like our Facebook, and then Roku.
NEUT14|Really trying to pick up more shares of Facebook, Roku, CRM and see and a couple more.
NEUT15|I don't have him off the top of my head, but but basically it's it's always.
NEUT16|I view it as a as an opportunity to pick up some of those shares that you've been meaning to pick up.
NEUT17|You know, provided that that you can.
NEUT18|You know, of course that you have some.
NEUT19|Some cash on the sidelines or or a little bit.
NEUT20|A little bit of margin, you know, in play 'cause I do.
NEUT21|Personally, I don't really like selling.
NEUT22|You know, when there's a big red day, sometimes you kind of gotta do what you gotta do, but I don't like selling when there's a big red day.
BULL23|But I look at it as a great opportunity to pick up some.
BULL24|Shares that I've been eyeing for awhile, so next video I'm going to go ahead and put together some some companies that I've been eyeing that I want to pick up on the next Red Day and until then, thank you very much and I hope you have a great week.
