BEAR0|"""Here we go 18 T still at 30 bucks alright 2 to $20 billion market cap 220 P is actually high is actually 20 / 20 Now it's gone up in price profit margins low 6.7%."
BULL1|Two X is so far revenue revenue is going up 147 to 181.
BULL2|Very nice profit growth Pillar #4 profit growth check Mark as well.
NEUT3|Barely even check Mark as well.
NEUT4|It made some big money in the last few years.
NEUT5|Shares outstanding.
NEUT6|We want this down baby.
BEAR7|This is definitely down.
NEUT8|Oh wow, it's not.
BULL9|It's up all its up a lot.
BEAR10|Current assets over liabilities Builder 650 versus 59.
BEAR11|Negative not good.
BULL12|Cash flow free cash flow growth save alot of free cash flow.
NEUT13|Jesus Christ 1617 eighteen 2327.
BULL14|Well they have really increasing free cash flow.
NEUT15|That's an average of like 22 or 23.
NEUT16|If you're buying it for single digit free cash flow.
BEAR17|So the positives of this is the free cash flow multiples insane the negative is increasing shares outstanding and decreasing profits, decreasing profit.
NEUT18|No increasing profit yeah.
NEUT19|Let's see the trailing 12 months free cash flow.
BULL20|Wow, $28 billion in the last 12 months in free cash flow.
NEUT21|Good God.
NEUT22|I mean their dividend yield their dividend is safe 'cause they have 28 billion, they need 15 billion to pay their dividend.
NEUT23|That's a lot.
BULL24|That's really good.
NEUT25|Did we miss the boat on buying this when we told you guys to do so free money we set at 27 before wasn't 27 or something like that.
NEUT26|Now maybe it was in 27 then.
NEUT27|Maybe it was so it was on the 2027 listen, you're not buying this for growth though.
NEUT28|Guys, you're buying this for very little capital appreciation, mostly dividend.
NEUT29|Let's look at that momentum cementum son.
NEUT30|Alright so guys it crossed over at 35 and you bought it and sold.
BEAR31|You would've lost money right here so that's one of the one of the one of the problems with the momentum is you can lose money as long as you follow it.
NEUT32|That's the way it works.
BULL33|They sell off in March and then bounce back up.
NEUT34|So 18 T is one of those he loved anything.
NEUT35|It's safe.
NEUT36|Not why they're spending so much money on.
BULL37|Some people are saying that they're going to smoke it in partnership with HBO Max, who's going to be releasing movies directly to HBO Max possible, and that that sounds like great, great, maybe a great climb mixer.
NEUT38|That is true there.
NEUT39|They're going to start releasing brand new movies to HBO Ball.
NEUT40|I think the Wonder Woman movie or something.
NEUT41|It's all you know.
