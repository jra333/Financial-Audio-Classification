NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed to be a video chart on ticker symbol am, ZN, Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link also from this closure standpoint I do own Amazon from the long side of my retirement accounts so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
BEAR4|Well, a rough day today and I don't say that just because the price was red, but from a technical POV actually violated a relatively.
NEUT5|Interesting level, which was formed on Thursday and you can see right here at the 2975 Mark.
NEUT6|But essentially all day long just bounce, bounce, bounce.
NEUT7|So going into the day, it was more than valid question.
NEUT8|It was a rational question.
NEUT9|Be saying hey, is Amazon getting ready for some sort of balance?
NEUT10|And it was a pretty cruel joke actually because the price did bounce and make a movement to the upside.
NEUT11|Only then just get crushed to the downside.
NEUT12|So a Savage move right there.
NEUT13|And a good example from a trading standpoint that is on why you know risk management, stop losses matter, but.
NEUT14|With that move that brings about the first key update here, and that update is just based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed blow, they tend to act as resistance and you can actually see this is already played out here, so price broke down below 2975.
NEUT15|Spent a few times right there trying to get back above it could never quite do it.
NEUT16|Before you know the price then rolled back over, but point here being that yes, there is a respectable little balance right here going on.
NEUT17|No doubt about that nice little bounce, but I mean is there any sort of genuine power behind it?
NEUT18|Well, the first big test of that will be when it gets up to 2975.
NEUT19|Can it breakthrough it or is that level just going to smack it right back down?
NEUT20|If it can breakthrough it, the next key, overarching level you want to keep an eye on is that purple line up there, the 50.
NEUT21|Moving average currently valued right around the 3050 mark in terms of levels of support.
NEUT22|Nothing fancy here at all, literally just a question of where did the bleeding finally stopped today.
NEUT23|And generally speaking, stopped right down there at the 2910 Mark, so 2910.
NEUT24|Going to be that first, the level of support like said for that reason, and that reason alone, but overall rough way to end the week.
NEUT25|Yeah, a little bit of a miniature balance here, but we have to see if there's any sort of genuine power behind there or not.
NEUT26|Early next week.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL30|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT35|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note.
NEUT40|Is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT41|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT42|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
