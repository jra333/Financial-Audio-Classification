BEAR0|"""Entertainer rundown today."
NEUT1|Tim Big move options.
NEUT2|Insider joins mean a lot of people want to know is it time to get in or out of this market?
NEUT3|What do you think?
NEUT4|I think a little of both.
BULL5|I think we're going to be range bound here, at least for the short term, given the fact we saw that big sell off last week.
BULL6|Stocks seem to at least found mostly their footing here going forward.
NEUT7|I think using the SP Y-24 to the upside 2:30 of the downside.
NEUT8|So I'm selling upside calls spreads.
BEAR9|Downside put spreads just looking for the market, especially pre Memorial Day to kind of flounder around here.
NEUT10|Are there any names in particular you think will be big traders this week?
BEAR11|You know, obviously earning season starting to wind down.
NEUT12|We're looking at some of the economic numbers coming out, but until Washington kind of goes off the headlines here, I think that will be the dominant thing.
NEUT13|So I think the laundry list ready.
NEUT14|I kind of like value names that pay a little bit of a yield here with names like Coca Cola, Procter and Gamble's of the world.
NEUT15|Those growth names that have gotten ahead of themselves the Teslas and so forth I think probably to be avoided here.
NEUT16|So I think in kind of a sideways market, lean on those dividend yields more than on growth.
NEUT17|Tim, how much is the activity in Washington affecting how you're handling your portfolio right now?
NEUT18|Is it at all?
NEUT19|Yeah, absolutely.
BULL20|I think you know using you know Washington to kind of get into some positions have been a little underweight in cash, so I like the fact of the market selling off and there's a longer term investor.
NEUT21|You favor sell off because you can add your monthly kind of contribution at lower rates.
NEUT22|You know you can get in buy more stock for the same dollar amount, so sell off would be welcome for long term investors.
NEUT23|Certainly once I kind of contribute month over month.
BULL24|Thank you for coming on, but I have a good trading day.
NEUT25|"Tim YouTube."""
