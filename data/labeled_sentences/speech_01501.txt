BULL0|"""Hey guys, so since Motus GI Holdings Carter FDA approval on one of their products which we're going to discuss in a minute, the penny stock went up 38% from 180 to $246."
NEUT1|We're going to have a look at their technology and then discuss some revelant informations for investors just to let you know, this is not a financial advice.
NEUT2|I'm just the Med student in my third year and really interested in medical companies.
NEUT3|If you haven't subscribed yet then please do so and leave a like that would help me a lot.
NEUT4|So I'm going to explain their technology using this video to help you visualize.
NEUT5|And understand it as you see they developed a system that adds an useful function to conventional endoscopes.
NEUT6|Endoscopes are used in the got to detect any lesions such as bruises or polyps.
NEUT7|This is a picture showing a polyp and polyps are potential precancerous stages of colon cancer.
NEUT8|I don't know what the number of cases in the world is, but the prevalence in Switzerland is really high compared to other forms of cancer.
NEUT9|It's among the top three of all cancers regarding incidents and mortality in women and men.
BULL10|So I think this would be one important argument for the further development of endoscopes to improve outcomes.
NEUT11|So their product PureView, as you see in this picture, lets out a mixture of water and air to break up feces in the got.
NEUT12|Why is this important?
BEAR13|Because the ***** material could potentially cover bruises or polyps, which means the gastroenterologist.
NEUT14|Won't be able to detect it the traditional way of cleaning the gut from feces to use laxatives, but the main problem which comes with this prep is that it's often insufficient.
NEUT15|Here.
NEUT16|It says more than half preparations to be precise, 55% are insufficient, and you're asking yourself, maybe in what way?
BULL17|So this picture from the investor presentation shows it really good.
NEUT18|You see that only 38% of the gut is cleaned with the traditional way of cleaning.
NEUT19|Whereas with their product you get to clean the whole organ.
NEUT20|I guess they profit a lot from their sleeves, which are rather expensive.
NEUT21|$975 per sleeve isn't a small amount and the question is how big the benefit would be for the hospitals if they would buy their product.
NEUT22|Firstly that.
NEUT23|And Secondly how good their marketing is.
NEUT24|This depends on how good the sales manager is.
NEUT25|I don't know anything about their sales manager.
NEUT26|Jeff Hutchinson, but he has over 25 years of executive sales leadership experience in the medical device industry, which means he probably has a lot of valuable experience in this area.
NEUT27|Here you see some companies and institutions they working with.
BULL28|Mayo Clinic is a very renowned clinic.
BULL29|Its reputation is well known even in Switzerland, so this is a good thing.
NEUT30|We got another very interesting pennystock would like to hear the opinion of a gastroenterologist as well.
NEUT31|Or any other physician working in this area, for example, oncologists which are specialized in colon cancer.
BULL32|I'm curious to see how their product PureView performs in the clinics and see if the stock grows even further.
NEUT33|As always, do your own research before jumping to any conclusions.
NEUT34|I'm not a financial or medical advisor.
NEUT35|"Thank you for watching like and subscribe if you want to see more stuff from me and see you in the next one by."""
