BEAR3|So as we can see, GBP JPY has been declining in today's trading while earlier in the day it he did a 1 1/2 month low 142.46.
BEAR4|The RSI is projecting a narrative picture in the short term as we consider indicator is comfortably in bearish territory and 37 and it is heading lower.
BEAR5|The overall bias is also to the downside.
BEAR6|We can see that the 10 concern line remains below the blue kitchen send line, while if they appear finishes the day lower than this would be the 5th day in a row that that it would do so.
BEAR7|If the price is indeed continues declining, then support could be made around the current level of the 200 day moving average, or 141.97 should this be violated.
BULL8|Then further down additional support could come from the region around the 141 level which was of significance in the past.
BEAR9|As we can see, this was a congested area in the past.
NEUT10|If, on the other hand, the price advances resistance could be made around the cloud, both home and cloud and cloud top ranging from 143.23 to 143.375.
BEAR11|Bear in mind that area around the cloud bottom failed to provide supported early in the day.
NEUT12|It could instead act as into the resistance.
NEUT13|Further up, another support area could be formed around the kind level of the 50 day moving average at 144.10, while a break above this area would shift focus to the range between the 10 cannon kinda loose and lines at 144.62 and 145.11 respectively.
BULL14|Concluding with the medium term picture, it looks predominantly neutral given the considerable sideways movement over the last three months, and the fact that the price is currently in between the 50 and 200 day moving average is a safer today.
