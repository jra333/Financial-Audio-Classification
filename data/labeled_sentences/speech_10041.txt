NEUT0|"""Top of the morning family top of the Morning Man man another blessed day man."
NEUT1|Like I say everybody have been following my journey man I started from you know.
NEUT2|$500 here you know, maybe $200 there and just built it up.
BULL3|Man, build My Portfolio up today.
NEUT4|Man, I hit that 50K man.
BULL5|50 bands man so it's a blessing man.
NEUT6|I had a lot of y'all hit me up on how I buy options, you know, and it's just my personal.
NEUT7|You know what I do know financial advisors, so this is not financial advice.
NEUT8|I'm just showing you guys what I do.
NEUT9|So anyways, look step by step.
NEUT10|We get to the option calls think it's going up.
NEUT11|I like to kind of look at the calls and see what the dates and what the strike prices are.
NEUT12|So if I can, preferably I'd like to get something that's a little out.
NEUT13|I always look for something like a month out that's just me, 'cause personally I've I've lossed when I got stuff that inspires that week.
NEUT14|You know some crazy drastic happens in the market.
NEUT15|Next, you know price tanks on something stupid and now you're out of money.
NEUT16|You know your contract expires out of money, so always keep that in mind.
NEUT17|I like to look for something like.
NEUT18|I say that there's possibly a month out, so and if you look.
NEUT19|If you look at that, go through these.
NEUT20|There's not a lot of times there's not much difference in price from something that's a. Amarch call to something that's maybe in April.
NEUT21|I even have what they call leaps, which are basically call options that are like a year out, so it gives the stock if I believe the stock has potential for growth, it's going to give me the opportunity to let that sit in mature so you can see I even have some Nokia.
NEUT22|Call options that expire 2022 so.
NEUT23|Either way, man's pig strike price that you feel is something that you know is looking good and then go ahead and make that and again, what a car option is to remember you're buying the.
NEUT24|Opportunity to buy 100 shares of that stock at that price, right so?
NEUT25|And then if you look, you'll see the break even say this contract cost me $0.51.
NEUT26|It's going to cost $100 per share.
NEUT27|$400 plus the $51.00 for the contract.
NEUT28|There's my break even price anything over that.
NEUT29|It's good money anyways.
BULL30|"Man y'all stay blessed."""
