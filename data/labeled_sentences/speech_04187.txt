BULL0|"""Ladies and gentlemen, we are going through one of our best days in history in the stock market."
BEAR1|We are calling U.S. stock market crash.
NEUT2|We already published the second bundle of professional short sellers the Carnage Bundle and Netflix.
NEUT3|It is included in that bundle or it is a test been included.
NEUT4|So I recommended to close during the course of 2014.
NEUT5|Low battery moon position.
NEUT6|Next weeks.
NEUT7|This stuff that I recommend as number one.
NEUT8|Investment opportunity in the world $52.86 and in 2014 I recommended for closing title loan positions and to sell short the stock the most to hold precisely on the very that government sites.
BULL9|The analyst upgraded this talk to $590.00 as.
NEUT10|It is disclosed in the blog of the company, so just a few days ago we iterated the strong sell rating in Netflix and therefore here you have Netflix at $335 and why?
NEUT11|If you have Netflix at this price because that is, as everyone knows, huge a massive bubble in U.S. stock markets.
NEUT12|So this is just a question of timing.
NEUT13|Before these collapse entirely.
NEUT14|So this is the first stuff to go, but there are many more that they will follow the same pattern.
NEUT15|But for all of those investors or traders that both Netflix on Berman Sacks at play, I do believe that they deserve entirely the losses because my friends in our history more than two decades, we never failed.
NEUT16|So why will be afraid this time there was no.
NEUT17|Priority will surrender to fail by Sally Netflix and going short, the stock the most for the total collapse the meltdown.
NEUT18|Moreover, as I explained, I said many months ago that I proved to predict live stock prices and here you have the blog post where everything was disclosed regarding Netflix improved in the case study.
NEUT19|And he had a way of the recommendation using investors to sell the stock at 472 to Goldman Sachs sheep followers on their upgrade to $590.00.
NEUT20|So you just have to play if you wish the case, study and then to read this sentence since it is repeated in every single case study, it does not make any difference how beautiful your guess is.
NEUT21|It does not make any difference.
NEUT22|How smart you are?
NEUT23|Who made the gas or what his name is?
NEUT24|If it disagrees with my view, it is wrong because I can read the market and that is all there is to say and that is the reality.
NEUT25|For the past two decades because there is nothing else to say.
NEUT26|And here you have the crash in Netflix.
NEUT27|And congratulations to everyone.
BULL28|"Thank you."""
