NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Wednesday, May 24th.
NEUT2|I'm Celina necklace technical analyst.
NEUT3|Exam.com today will look at the Australian dollar versus U.S. dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR4|So we can see that AUDUSD maintains a down trend that started from the March high of Zero Point 7748.
BEAR5|The medium term outlook is bearish and hasn't changed and the market remains below the 200 day moving average.
BEAR6|Keeping a bearish outlook and the crossover of the 50 day below the 200 day earlier this week is actually supporting the bearish view.
BEAR7|Meanwhile, if we look at the momentum indicators, makde is below the zero line, so it's in bearish territory and the RSI.
BEAR8|Is rising, but this rise has stalled.
BEAR9|Now it's paused at 50, suggesting that there's a fading upside.
BULL10|Momentum in prices.
NEUT11|We could see that today.
BEAR12|So, after peaking testing the .75 level yesterday, prices turned back down, so it's paused, a rally that started from the point 7330 area.
BEAR13|So this .75 level is now acting as a strong resistance level and failure to rise back above it soon could see prices had lower towards support at .74 and then falling past the May 9 low of point 7328 would suggest that a lower high is in place here at .75 Fifty 16 that was hit on me 23rd.
BEAR14|So we could say that the market is starting to make lower lower lows and lower highs.
NEUT15|The market would then see resumption of the downtrend that started from point 7748.
NEUT16|If prices fall below this point 7330 area and then there's scope to target Point 73 and then the December low of point 7160.
BEAR17|So only moved back above the key .75 level and back above the 200 day moving average would signal a shift from the current medium term bearish picture turn more bullish.
BULL18|One thanks so much for watching.
BULL19|"Have a great day."""
