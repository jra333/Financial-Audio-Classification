NEUT0|"""So this is really interesting."
NEUT1|I don't know if you guys have invested in crypto currencies based on marijuana, but you know there is opportunity.
NEUT2|I think stock market is the way to go, especially since Canada is a first mover.
NEUT3|I do feel like if you have access to the Canadian stock market.
NEUT4|You should do some research into marijuana and I just see this gaining a lot of market share and the main reason I think that marijuana is going to gain so much market share.
NEUT5|It just doesn't have the same negative effects as smoking cigarettes and alcohol in and in fact you don't even need to quote me the US surgeon general actually stated that and he got a lot of heat for this, 'cause it was a couple of years ago, but he actually stated that marijuana is safer than alcohol and cigarettes.
NEUT6|So do your own research and this might be an investment opportunity, and it doesn't have to be crypto I. I think the safer places to to look at stocks, but I would consider if you are going to be going for altcoins.
NEUT7|Look at the marijuana projects because there is a lot of utility in crypto currencies with marijuana, especially with the issue of banking and how it's legal in the US but not illegal and.
NEUT8|"It's very hard for a lot of marijuana producers to be able to do banking, so let me know your thoughts on this and I will talk to you guys soon."""
