BEAR0|"""Still got this pandemic."
BULL1|We spent a lot of money already.
NEUT2|What do you think we need right now from the Biden administration and whatever the makeup of Congress is.
NEUT3|And do you think we'll get it or are we already out over our skis in terms of valuation?
NEUT4|So what we need right now for the economy, I want to stress for the economy is a broader policy response, and I think most economists agree on what we need and hasn't been any different in the last couple of years.
NEUT5|What we need for the markets is the Fed to continue with the pedal to the metal approach, and I suspect that they will continue and.
NEUT6|The one thing I would add to my to Mike Santoli is really good analysis is that most people are waiting for a dip to buy.
NEUT7|So to the extent that we do get a dip, look for buyers to come quickly because it's so deeply ingrained that there is no alternative to stocks right now.
BULL8|So as long as the Fed remains supportive of markets, the path of least resistance is going to be going up despite the economy struggling a lot drop Journal.
NEUT9|So what what type of non Fed stuff would you like to see and what do you think is possible?
NEUT10|An would you raise taxes?
NEUT11|For example given the opportunity with the kind of economy we have right now is the backdrop.
NEUT12|So you need three things.
NEUT13|One is you need to counter when it's going to be intense.
BEAR14|Downward pressure on productivity.
BULL15|We have higher concentration of companies.
NEUT16|We have less globalization.
BEAR17|All of that is going to lower productivity.
BULL18|We have massive gains that can be achieved domestically.
NEUT19|Just think about infrastructure, what labor retooling retraining can do that first?
BULL20|Second on the fiscal side, we've got to get better at supporting pro growth initiatives, and that's really critical.
NEUT21|It involves.
NEUT22|Fiscal reform, not just whether you raise taxes, whether you cut taxes, you need to reform the system.
NEUT23|And Thirdly, we need to be a global leader.
BULL24|There are things out there globally that can improve the outlook for everybody.
BULL25|All this is attainable.
NEUT26|It comes down to politics and Georgia is important in this regard.
NEUT27|Then tell me tell me how that's going to, how you expect that to play out and what do you mean it's important.
NEUT28|So you know I'm not a political analyst.
BEAR29|I suspect it's going to be closed.
NEUT30|It's important because you want.
NEUT31|The administration to be able to move one way or the other if we get a divided Congress, which is what we likely to get, then we're not going to see any major.
NEUT32|Economic reform measures so that that's a tradeoff between on the one hand, whisking one party, doing things you don't like, versus risking paralysis, and that's what we're facing right now.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
