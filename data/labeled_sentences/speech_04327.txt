BULL0|"""Is Mike and I will talk about value stocks because we had a big move in value stocks."
BULL1|This is some looking to hear the Vanguard S&P 500 value index symbol is V. OV was up over 4%.
BEAR2|Now compare that to the S&P 500, which was up 1.26% and then compare that to the tech heavy NASDAQ that was actually down 2% and it looks like we may get some rotation into value stocks.
NEUT3|I did a video on Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT4|Let's just take a look at the Berkshire B.
BULL5|Class starts to swell up 6%.
BULL6|Coca Cola just one of the most traditional value stocks out there is up 6% as well.
NEUT7|So if you've been looking at EV stocks, those hot stocks, like your workhorse and all that, and you're looking to get some great performance, but you won't be a little conservative with portfolio.
NEUT8|You should go ahead and look at value stocks.
NEUT9|I would definitely take a look at Coca Cola.
NEUT10|Or maybe end up Walmart was down, but I do think Walmart is going to have a great fourth quarter with the E Commerce else, so that's a stock you maybe want to look at.
NEUT11|And then if you don't know what value stock to get in, another great move is just to go into the Dow index because the Dow is 30 companies and the basically the third largest companies out there.
NEUT12|That's a nice safe way to play the value play.
NEUT13|But I as long as how long this value plays gonna last.
NEUT14|I'm not sure.
NEUT15|I mean, if you look at the Dow here, this is actually a pretty good set up.
NEUT16|Ways have this big dip in this little bit of a break out.
NEUT17|You have two 9121.
NEUT18|It's broken through the September high and it's also broken through this June high, so it sat down with the the Dow is out of six months high here so maybe if you have money in the NASDAQ and you're looking to rotate, you might want to rotate into the Dow ETF which is D or also known as the diamonds.
NEUT19|I don't know how life because I do feel like for the fourth quarter is historically the best time of the year for tech stocks.
BULL20|So I do think tech stocks are still going to do well.
NEUT21|People are going to be buying a lot of stuff for Christmas.
BULL22|That means your Amazon's in your Walmarts are going to do well.
NEUT23|And that's another reason why I recommend.
NEUT24|Or you know, I would tell you.
NEUT25|Take a look at Walmart because even though Walmart was down yesterday, it gives you the best of both worlds.
NEUT26|It is very much like a traditional value stock that peas at 22 but it's going to get a lot of sales for the fourth quarter.
BULL27|They have now Walmart is finally getting a really nice big ecommerce presence.
NEUT28|Look at the six months.
NEUT29|It's my choice.
BULL30|Actually pretty good, yesterday's action notwithstanding.
BULL31|I do think though, that no matter where you put your money in the first quarter, you're actually going to be OK.
NEUT32|The only place I would not put my money early in the fourth quarter would be in commodities, 'cause if you look at gold, gold really got slammed.
BEAR33|Jeff stairways down 4 1/2%.
BEAR34|That's a shame 'cause gold showed some promise in the beginning of the year, but then it's pretty much leveled off and done nothing.
NEUT35|I think the assumption with gold was that with all this spending with the pandemic that you were going to get some inflation and gold would be a great place to put your money, but.
NEUT36|Right now for the short term, it looks like the diamonds.
NEUT37|I do think over the next two months though I would.
BULL38|I would definitely keep my money in the NASDAQ because I do think that the NASDAQ had a huge five day rally.
NEUT39|You've had this sell off, but I don't think this will last too much longer.
NEUT40|I think people go back into the ecommerce stocks in your tech stocks, but maybe this week we take a breather on the NASDAQ.
NEUT41|So that's my update.
