BULL9|Not only refreshing but also appetizing and satisfies your stomach.
NEUT10|So in order to make this culture, it's pretty simple.
NEUT11|We don't need to model, and it's not very labor intensive.
NEUT12|We have about five ingredients here.
NEUT13|We have our sweet Clementine that will take about 1 1/2 ounces.
NEUT14|If you do have a jigger at home and it's very easy to measure, you can also do free por even though you screw up on a little bit of ingredients here, it's not going to make a big difference for the flavor combination.
NEUT15|After that you have about 1/4 ounce of lemon juice.
NEUT16|People in here that provides a lot of vitamin C antioxidants.
NEUT17|Then we have about an ounce and a half of pear juice here.
NEUT18|Half an ounce of mango juice.

NEUT25|Don't put too much in it, otherwise it will remind you of a falafel.
NEUT26|So just take this up.
NEUT27|Then use a strainer to strain this into a martini glass and you can see it has a really beautiful orange color already to it.
NEUT28|A nice beautiful froth which is created by the lemon and pear juice together and the last thing we need to do is cut the Billboard which is an orange rose and the way we do this is we thinly slice orange peel from an orange but like 3 or 4 inches.
NEUT29|Often orange, and we slowly roll it to the shape that it already bends to hold it with an index finger in our thumb, have an incision through all the different layers and put this on the glass.
