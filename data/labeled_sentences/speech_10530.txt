BULL0|"""For it is an historic morning for markets and for medicine, as well as Pfizer's vaccine."
BULL1|Data shows 90% efficacy.
NEUT2|No serious safety concerns.
NEUT3|So far, massive implications for stocks, oil, global growth, interest rates, the Fed, the future of America at large.
NEUT4|We are looking here.
NEUT5|Take a look at the screen.
NEUT6|You won't see many mornings like this.
BEAR7|One of the biggest gaps higher in recent memory.
NEUT8|Jim, an stocks with all time highs, insight at the open yet look.
NEUT9|We have to be careful because there are many many companies that benefit but.
NEUT10|We have been piling into stocks that were meant to be as if there was no vaccine till sometime, maybe sometime late 2021, where there then they'll be 2022.
BEAR11|So yeah, the NASDAQ futures up way too much.
NEUT12|You have the SNP I think in Dow up the correct amount given what what is in those stocks because you've got the bank stocks suddenly.
NEUT13|Maybe they get a real break, travel and leisure.
BEAR14|Just incredible how bad they've been.
NEUT15|But then again you've got say the stocks like I don't know what do you do with the service now here.
NEUT16|Honestly, what do you do with a company like a zoom Palatine?
NEUT17|I, I think it those stocks are uniquely price for a belief that that Covid is going to be with us for a long time.
NEUT18|David, you know that a lot of these stocks are trading, not as if they're going to be households, and everyone is going to happen, but they've been trading as if there's going to be catastrophic.
BEAR19|Catastrophic growth in number of cases.
NEUT20|And while there's still clipping for the next 3-4 months, I think there's going to be element that says that.
NEUT21|You know what?
NEUT22|It can be.
NEUT23|It can get under control.
NEUT24|So start thinking about the second half of 2021 for numbers, right?
BEAR25|Well, unfortunately there has been catastrophic growth in cases, and unfortunately that seems to be something that we're going to be living with for the next few months.
NEUT26|To your point, Jim now use made this earlier on Squawk Box slowly over other point, which is the stocks move well in advance of course of the actual return of revenues of significant revenues.
NEUT27|But you know what?
NEUT28|What interests me the most is what happened to your point?
NEUT29|How much do you sell some of the big technology stocks?
NEUT30|How much did Microsoft really sell off today?
NEUT31|Jim?
NEUT32|Well, if at all, based on the reopening trade that clearly a lot of people have had on, or if they didn't have it on there, putting it on today, which also included one would assume hedging in certain areas and potentially being short some names.
NEUT33|I mean I can understand why you sell Amazon or eBay, right?
NEUT34|Why would you sell Micro so that that's on the cusp of what you want to buy?
NEUT35|If things come down because that's that's a business that benefited but wasn't really why you bought it.
NEUT36|And I would tell you, let's go further Apple.
NEUT37|I mean how many times have we sat here and said you know what Apple is going to be?
NEUT38|Just crushed?
NEUT39|When President Xi says he hates President Trump, well, you know David that that narrative is not as much in place.
NEUT40|It was a week ago.
NEUT41|So I think you buy Apple.
NEUT42|That one comes in.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
