NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, Steve here from the turtlefollower.com and in this video we're going to take a look at a trade idea in Facebook."
NEUT1|One of the social media stocks.
NEUT2|One of the high Flyers.
NEUT3|Everybody looks to trade doesn't really give you too many opportunities to get into it, but here we are today with a great looking setup.
BULL4|So first let's take a quick look at the weekly chart and you can see that we've just been trending higher over the last year to two years.
BEAR5|Stock is really taken off really since the middle of July 2013.
BULL6|And you could see it trade it up, pulled back to the 200 day moving average, and then traded higher again, and then ultimately consolidated.
NEUT7|Now I think we spoke the other day about consolidating or correcting via time instead of price, and that's what happened here.
NEUT8|You could see it came up and then it spent a good part of six months going sideways in a range between 81 and 72.
NEUT9|Alright ultimately broke out and then again.
BULL10|Put in another consolidation on the weekly chart.
NEUT11|I just recently broke out on the 22nd out of that consolidation so.
NEUT12|Now we know obviously that we want to belong the stock.
NEUT13|It's trending higher and now it's time to find where exactly we want to get along the stock.
NEUT14|So here you can see.
NEUT15|On the week.
BEAR16|I'm sorry on the daily chart.
BULL17|Their Facebook is now trending higher and again breaking out from a daily consolidation.
NEUT18|So here was that weekly consolidation.
NEUT19|We just spoke about.
NEUT20|Right through here.
BULL21|OK, ultimately broke out, spend a couple more weeks consolidating and is now breaking out again.
NEUT22|So what I'm looking for in this trade for Facebook, it's definitely an aggressive trade alright.
NEUT23|But again, I think the way this stock is acted over the last couple years, it's worth taking.
NEUT24|So what my trade is right now in Facebook is buying this tomorrow at the open, putting a stop right here around 8545, eighty 550 and seeing what we can get out of this now look at how 8550.
NEUT25|ACTED as.
NEUT26|Support so one of the old adage is for trading is old resistance becomes new support.
BULL27|OK so it was resistance here back in March once again in the middle of April, finally broke through, came back and held that level OK right here on the 30th of June and just recently on the 8th of July.
NEUT28|So those that level to me seems or is very substantial.
NEUT29|I think if it broke 8550 I wouldn't need to see it.
NEUT30|Wait until it came back to trend line or the 50 day moving average.
NEUT31|I think at that point to trade that we're taking right here right now, buying this on an extended break out is over on a breakdown below 8550, so that's how I'm trading Facebook.
