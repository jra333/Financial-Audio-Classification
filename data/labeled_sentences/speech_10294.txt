BULL0|"""Congratulations, you just won the seven $31 million jackpot."
NEUT1|You're the Powerball King, right?
NEUT2|Maybe not you specifically, but someone in Maryland just one.
NEUT3|So what do you do with that kind of massive windfall?
NEUT4|Speaking as someone who's actually done this kind of thing before some planning, I've got some advice for the Powerball King or anyone else who's sitting on a gigantic pilot change first with matching money.
NEUT5|When you're wealthy, you only need to get rich once.
NEUT6|Now people come to you with schemes, long lost relatives, great ideas, unknown ingratiate as they want to break into your bank account.
NEUT7|Believe me, the con artists are never going to stop.
NEUT8|And they're going to get you is brutal, especially long term cons.
NEUT9|So once you've made your fortune, don't give people loans.
NEUT10|In fact, that invest in anything that is any risk for the vast majority of your newfound fortune.
NEUT11|Who needs risk when you're already rich?
NEUT12|Second, in the case of Powerball, you've had chance to take of taking 731,000,000 as their annuity or smaller lump sum.
NEUT13|Always take the lump sum you can stick it in Treasury bonds and the interest you will accrue will make you more than if you got it.
BEAR14|If you look, if you took the annuity plus the top marginal tax rate is as low as it's been in decades thanks to President Trump's tax reform package.
NEUT15|Better to pay the taxes now because that makes only going to go up from here 3rd when you're super rich like this.
NEUT16|Your main worry is not the taxman.
NEUT17|You've got to be worried about inflation, specifically hyperinflation.
NEUT18|That's the only thing that can really threaten the 9 digit Porcher.
NEUT19|If you're managing a normal portfolio, I wouldn't actually think that much about inflation.
BEAR20|Now we have persistently low inflation since the early 90s.
NEUT21|It's just not a serious concern.
