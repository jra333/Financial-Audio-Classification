NEUT0|"""Clearly the ports struggles have been kind of on going and you know Nike was not immune from them, but I think the important thing for us is this is near term in temporal in nature as vaccines rollout as the social distancing post vaccine can kind of come a little bit closer together."
BULL1|We do think some of the port challenges will improve.
BULL2|Furthermore, having talked to Nike last night, it does sound that some of the container challenges they've been able to kind of lean into their relationships and really leverage some opportunity to see some of that improve, so they're not seeing as much constraint currently with that container piece.
NEUT3|Of this shortage.
BULL4|So as we look forward into the fourth quarter, which is their mate quarter, you know revenue should be up 75% so everything that was lost in the third quarter should come back.
NEUT5|Inventory is flowing currently and candidly.
NEUT6|The brand is really never been, you know, as hot as it is.
NEUT7|So we do think this is temporal in nature and buying the dip this morning.
NEUT8|Yeah, and right now we're showing a graphic with some other major retailers talking about their supply chain issues.
NEUT9|I know you also cover some other retailers, so I have to ask you with stimulus checks coming.
NEUT10|Is everybody buying Jordans dry fit pants and chucks or does that money go to some other retailers?
NEUT11|Yeah, look.
NEUT12|I think I mean using Jordan is an example.
NEUT13|That brand is very hot right now.
NEUT14|Very relevant and we don't see that going away.
BULL15|We think it's well positioned for stimulus check.
BULL16|Other brands that we cover we think are pretty well positioned.
NEUT17|Would be brands like Elf that's in the cosmetic space more value oriented Under Armour as well so we think and even some of the handbag names.
BULL18|So stimulus this year is going to look better than it was last last year with $1400 checks going into the pockets of both adults and.
NEUT19|And children as well.
BULL20|So you know this is going to be, I think, a pretty robust opportunity for many of the names in our coverage to see a little bit of a tailwind as we move forward into this spring and into the early summer.
NEUT21|So bit of a personal question here, and I'm actually a big Nike fan.
NEUT22|I wear their sneakers.
NEUT23|I wear a lot of their clothes on their website a couple of weeks ago buying some workout clothes.
NEUT24|Lot of sizes were out, but at the same time there weren't any discounts.
NEUT25|I barely saw any discounts on the website.
NEUT26|I'm a big fan of direct to consumer business.
NEUT27|Does Nike need to get a bit more promotional or do they also need to kind of maybe innovate?
NEUT28|'cause the other thing I didn't see was a lot of different colorways.
NEUT29|And variations on the on the stuff for the workout.
NEUT30|Clothes that I kind of feel like I saw in years past.
NEUT31|Yeah, well, first of all I love that you do your own research and obviously you're out shopping.
BULL32|That's great look, I think the lack of promotions and you know, is actually a really positive thing.
NEUT33|So the industry right now is clearly clean from inventory.
NEUT34|Some of that was just how lean inventory was going into the fall season, and some of that is candidly, some of these shipping delays that are kind of pulling inventory a little bit later into the season.
BULL35|That being said, I think it's an incredible position for Nike to be in.
NEUT36|That they aren't having to promote it speaks to the health of the brand.
BULL37|One of the interesting tidbits from the quarter ASP, so their average selling price was up double digits in the quarter.
BULL38|Their full priced business was higher than it's been historically.
BULL39|In gross margins were up 130 basis points.
NEUT40|So actually to me that shows the power of the brand and the power of this shift towards digital.
NEUT41|Which is their best margin channel.
NEUT42|So I think from an innovation perspective, just to you know layer on your kind of second kind of maybe comment or concern.
BULL43|I think as we move forward towards the Tokyo Olympics, which as of now we're still hearing is happening in some way, shape or form, there will be more innovation to come.
NEUT44|So stay tuned on that front.
NEUT45|But they're doing a lot on the footwear a lot around carbon neutrality or zero waste footwear, and I think you'll see some new things coming.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
