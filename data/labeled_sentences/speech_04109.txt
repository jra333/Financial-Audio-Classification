BULL0|"""The Occupy Wall Street movement has shown the world a lot of things for one that people are looking for more integrity and honesty from the financial sector."
NEUT1|And I couldn't agree more with that.
NEUT2|That's really why I'm proud to work at The Motley Fool.
NEUT3|I love coming to work every day because I know that I'm making a real difference in people's lives.
NEUT4|I was a hedge fund manager for nine years, focusing on small value investing, concentrated portfolios and then in 2008 I probably became a fool.
BULL5|I'm really proud of my track record as a hedge fund manager.
BULL6|Over the nine years I manage money, I beat the market by 145% in total.
NEUT7|Over that period of time.
NEUT8|Analyzing stocks all day, every day is what I do.
NEUT9|It's what I pretty much always done, and so you know that that always has been a lot of fun for me.
NEUT10|Learning about new companies, putting capital at risk behind your best ideas.
NEUT11|The great thing about The Motley Fool and $1,000,000 portfolio in particular versus the hedge fund world is that hedge funds are really only available to wealthier clients.
NEUT12|What we call accredited investors where The Motley Fool and $1,000,000 portfolio are focused on individual investors.
NEUT13|Of all shapes and sizes, you don't have to be wealthy.
NEUT14|You don't have to be able to afford the 2% in 20%.
NEUT15|Of the profits that clients pay the hedge funds when we talk about $1,000,000 portfolio, we often use the term the best of the best.
NEUT16|The Motley Fool has hundreds of stock recommendations from across our newsletter services.
NEUT17|Rulebreakers hidden Gems stock advisor.
NEUT18|For example, an investor said can you help me create a portfolio from all of these companies?
NEUT19|And that's exactly why $1,000,000 portfolio was created.
NEUT20|We actually mended $1,000,000 of the Motley Fool's money, and we put that money into the best of the best recommendations from across The Motley Fool.
NEUT21|Newsletter services.
NEUT22|And we tell our members exactly when to buy.
NEUT23|Went to sell.
NEUT24|How much of that stock to buy and at what price they should be purchasing that stock.
NEUT25|Yeah, the analytical Department here is the investing group as we call it.
BULL26|We're very close knit group.
NEUT27|Were talking stocks constantly all day long.
NEUT28|All I have to do is yell over and say hey Andy, how do you like XYZ stock today?
NEUT29|So when I looked at Ron you could tell me that this $1,000,000 portfolio is a $5 million portfolio or $10 million.
BULL30|Portfolio an I would say I feel completely confident in Ron.
NEUT31|I felt that way with a million.
NEUT32|It is $1,000,000.
BULL33|It does mean a lot to us as a company, but I also know that we've got somebody who is highly confident in who I completely trust.
NEUT34|One thing I didn't like about the hedge fund world was where I helped.
NEUT35|Kind of nameless faceless institutions make money and invested their capital, but I really like about The Motley Fool.
NEUT36|It's all about the individual investor.
NEUT37|Your next door neighbor.
NEUT38|Your father, your son, and it's really important to help those people take control of their financial futures and the community is such a big part of The Motley Fool.
NEUT39|You don't really have that in the hedge fund world.
NEUT40|Well, I think the reason there's a movement called Occupy Wall Street right now, in part, is because people are saying what is going on in these organizations.
BEAR41|They're putting a lot at risk and we can't even really connect with them.
NEUT42|It's faceless and what we're developing and have been developing for 18 years is its us.
NEUT43|We're right here.
NEUT44|We're not hiding from our mistakes.
BULL45|"We're here to answer any questions you have, and we're here to get smarter 'cause we can work together."""
