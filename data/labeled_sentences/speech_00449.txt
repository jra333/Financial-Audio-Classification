NEUT0|"""Another one, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
BULL1|We can see Apple has.
BULL2|Jumped from the negative area very quickly and to the positive area.
NEUT3|Kept flight until the end of the.
NEUT4|The close of the market, as we can see from the.
NEUT5|Daily candle stick we consider has formed a green candle with a large body.
NEUT6|So this green candle.
BULL7|Has confirmed that we are still well above the uptrend because if we compare the price level we can see it has managed to bounce back.
NEUT8|To the.
NEUT9|Beyond this point, I mean, here is the formal, high and now we have the real body beyond this point.
NEUT10|That means we are still in the afternoon channel under the breakout.
NEUT11|From here is still valid.
BULL12|So even though yesterday we have touched this level and closed beyond this level, but today we have penetrated this level and pull back quickly.
NEUT13|But as to the volume, the volume is not so strong.
NEUT14|It means the buying power.
NEUT15|Is not so strong and then we can notice that the upside of the.
NEUT16|Kendall has just been.
BEAR17|Squeezed below the five days, yeah, may so it hasn't.
NEUT18|It hasn't penetrated five days yet, so it still pressure showing here so should be careful even though we have revised the downside.
BEAR19|Trend monitor, but we are still stuck between the five days.
NEUT20|You may and attending CMA.
BULL21|"Thank you."""
