BEAR0|"""Snap is out with its earnings results."
NEUT1|Jerrod Blicker has that fresh air and.
BEAR2|That's right, and we're seeing the stock down about 6 1/2% in after hours trading here.
BEAR3|Maybe because of negative free cash flow will get to that in a second.
NEUT4|But aside from that, all the very all the top line metrics here really checking out.
BULL5|So revenue came in at a 911.3 million, much higher than the estimate of 856 million.
BULL6|That's up to 62% year over year.
BULL7|Also came in with an adjusted earnings per share of $0.09 versus $0.03 a year ago, and higher than the estimate from Wall Street at 6.7 cents adjusted IVA.
NEUT8|Della coming in at 165.6 million.
BEAR9|Versus estimates of 141.2 million.
NEUT10|Now here's that line negative free cash flow of $69 million and just a side note on that.
NEUT11|They're also saying free cash flow includes $98 million payment.
NEUT12|A $98 million payment from for a non recurring legal charge.
NEUT13|So something that happened only once related to securities class action in 2019.
BULL14|They see building on investments in augmented reality mapping and content to drive growth.
NEUT15|And here's the first quarter forecast.
NEUT16|They're seeing revenue of 720 million 740,000,000.
BULL17|And that is higher than the street was expecting at a 705 million.
BEAR18|Also seeing an adjusted EBIT, a loss of 50 to $7 million, and that compares with an estimated profit of 17 and a half million.
BEAR19|So I think those discrepancies right there, the expected EBIT a loss and also that negative free cash flow could be scaring the investors at least in early trading here, but I'm sure we'll get some more color on that in the call.
BEAR20|Stock is down about 6%, and just checking out what it's done over the last year.
BULL21|That has been one of the high Flyers.
BULL22|Up 207% guys.
BULL23|"Alright, thanks so much Jerry."""
