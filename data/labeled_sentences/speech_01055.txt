NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Almost at Facebook?
NEUT2|What's going on?
NEUT3|YouTube happy Wednesday.
NEUT4|I think it is the reason why I almost said Facebook is 'cause that's some of mine and that's the question I have to ask you.
NEUT5|Are you going to purchase stock in Facebook when it becomes public?
NEUT6|You know, when I heard that statement come out, you know the first thing I could think of when I used to rekey esaki really have heavily Rob Ickes cycle.
NEUT7|That is and I remember one part in his book where he said that the best time to buy a stock is when it's private.
NEUT8|Not when it's public.
NEUT9|When it when when the stock becomes public, you know a lot of the big big earnings are pretty much.
NEUT10|Gone by now you know meaning like for instance, if you was a Angel investor and you were one who.
NEUT11|Put money into a start up company like Link in or maybe was Facebook or whatever or the next new company you have.
NEUT12|The likelihood of making some serious money at that level versus when something becomes public.
NEUT13|Now they're saying that with Facebook.
NEUT14|A lot of them are predicting that they probably would have the same success is Google.
NEUT15|You know, but then experts accent asking questions like OK well look.
NEUT16|Facebook has 8,000,000 users right now like where is the like.
NEUT17|When is the growth stuff for Facebook?
NEUT18|You know, like I'm sitting here making a video with You Tube, but with You Tube will one day something become much better than You Tube and totally blow YouTube out of the box?
NEUT19|You know, I remember when Myspace was just like Oh my gosh.
NEUT20|If you weren't my space, you weren't in the end thing, and all of a sudden Facebook came and blew it out of the water.
NEUT21|So.
NEUT22|What do you see the future of Facebook actually becoming?
NEUT23|So I just want to chime in 'cause I'm actually thinking about it.
NEUT24|Not saying I'm going to do it, but.
NEUT25|I saw the behavior LinkedIn, which is a much smaller.
NEUT26|Business then Facebook but everybody bought at the beginning and all of a sudden people were selling their stock.
NEUT27|At the end it was like they bought then all of a sudden the stuck just shut down, you know.
NEUT28|And a lot of people are saying that the price that Facebook is going to come out with at the beginning.
BEAR29|Maybe way overpriced.
NEUT30|No one knows.
NEUT31|So I'm thinking about it.
NEUT32|I just want to see what are you guys thinking about the Facebook stock Axem interviewing a CFP certified financial planner tomorrow?
NEUT33|And I'm going to ask him this question too, and I want to see what he comes from it.
NEUT34|So what we comes from, sorry, but so let me let me see your answer guys.
