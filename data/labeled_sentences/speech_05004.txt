NEUT0|"""We're going to analyze Netflix, and we're going to do it all in 90 seconds."
BULL1|You can thank Martin Eder H for prompting me to move Netflix up in my queue.
NEUT2|He is a loyal subscriber, a member of my private group of insiders and hails all the way from Padu Ola EV agouti request for Micron.
NEUT3|Very soon as well, and if you have a request, be sure to subscribe.
NEUT4|Click the Bell and then let me know in the comments.
NEUT5|Will get to it, but let's not waste anytime Netflix in 90 seconds or less.
NEUT6|That's what you're here for.
BULL7|Fair warning, I'm obviously going to go fast.
NEUT8|Let's put up a Clock and let's do this.
NEUT9|Netflix is a massive Internet television network.
NEUT10|As of this taping, it has a market capitalization of around $159 billion, with the price per share around $370 for existing shareholders, this represents an over 6000% over the last 10 years.
NEUT11|Are you too late to buy shares?
NEUT12|That's the question here.
NEUT13|A couple reasons you might consider owning Netflix.
BULL14|Netflix has been increasing subscribership like crazy as of the beginning of this year, they had approximately 117,000,000 members in 180 countries, which is insane when you consider the fact that there are only around 195 countries.
NEUT15|Depending on who you ask, in the world, in fact I know because my son is super into geography.
BULL16|They've proven the hard part that they can actually get into these countries.
NEUT17|Now they just have to increase the penetration within each management, which includes CEO founder.
BULL18|Reed Hastings has proven itself beyond savvy.
BULL19|My favorite example of this is their willingness disrupt themselves like they did in 2007 when they shifted their focus to streaming even though their income from the DVD by Mail service had more than doubled the prior year.
NEUT20|But here a few analytical reasons to not own Netflix.
NEUT21|There P is outrageous 236 versus its industry at 40 on the market at 19, PB ratio is almost 40 versus the industries three in the markets too.
BULL22|Recently the company has been increasing its debt quite a bit as they continue to invest in creating their own high quality content, but clearly investors are pricing in significant growth into its current share price as a simple discounted cash flow model of its future projected earnings suggest it's quite a bit overvalued today.
BULL23|Many investors perceive the amount of money Netflix is pouring into its content as a good long term investment.
BULL24|It appears to have a promising future and it has a good track record of staving off any real threats to its market share.
BULL25|But there is already a lot of growth priced into the stock should the stock market crash.
BEAR26|Netflix shareholders should not be surprised if they experience a drop much more dramatic than the market itself.
NEUT27|So what do you say?
NEUT28|Bye or no?
NEUT29|Does Netflix is subscriber ship growth justify such a high valuation today?
