NEUT0|"""Wow, I'm not even allowed you guys."
NEUT1|I didn't even really expect this to happen to AMC.
NEUT2|It honestly started to look like it was going to have a comeback today.
NEUT3|We did not get that come back yet, but man, am I hopeful yo what's up?
NEUT4|Everyone, it's your boy.
NEUT5|Thevan from market craze.
BULL6|I hope everyone is having a great day today.
NEUT7|If you're new around here, welcome to the channel.
BULL8|I hope you enjoy your stay and if you're returning member, welcome back.
NEUT9|So today we are going to be talking about AMC because honestly that is one of the biggest topics.
BEAR10|In the stock market world at the moment, AMC started to come back up, which is a complete difference from the last couple of days.
BULL11|AMC has been looking super Red the last couple of days and it was nice to just see a green for once.
NEUT12|But guys before we get into any of that, if you guys do enjoy daily stock market videos and daily stock market updates, please make sure to slap the subscribe button and turn on post notifications.
NEUT13|And hey, if you feel like being generous, make sure to slap a like on this video as well, but alright with that out of the way, AMC.
BULL14|Was looking really good today at market open and honestly even beyond that as well as of recording this video, AMC actually peaked at around $8.10 at 9:00 O'clock AM Central Standard Time now.
NEUT15|This was absolutely beautiful to see as we know, AMC was not looking too good these last couple of days completely crashing and crashing and burning.
BULL16|It was just nice to see AMC kind of open up at a high started to go down once again.
NEUT17|But I think that if we continue to open up that high like that could be really good news for the future, like I discussed in yesterday's video, no matter what happens to AMC, whether it does crash and burn, it goes back to two to $3.00, or whether it completely skyrockets.
NEUT18|It is a good asset to have in your portfolio.
NEUT19|Now you might be wondering why in the heck is AMC a good asset to have?
BEAR20|It has insane debt, and they were just banker.
NEUT21|I don't want to hear it though, from a lot of you guys know, AMC is debt free.
NEUT22|No, it's not.
NEUT23|At all AMC is not even near debt free.
NEUT24|There are a lot of companies out there that are successful in healthy companies that have debt just like AMC.
NEUT25|Now, with that being said, AMC does have a lot of debt, but it's still a good asset because once the pandemic is lifted, AMC is going to be an insane money maker and it's going to straight up print money.
NEUT26|Once this pandemic is lifted.
NEUT27|You might even want to buy dips whenever this company does actually go down again, but that's not financial advice.
NEUT28|I just make these videos for entertainment purposes.
NEUT29|Only I see AMC sitting around the seven to $8.00 mark on Monday, and that's kind of being a little generous.
BEAR30|But I definitely think AMC is going to make a slow run back up to $15 now that Robin Hood took the restrictions off of all these stocks.
NEUT31|But hey, that's just my opinion.
NEUT32|Please do not follow my opinion without doing your own research first.
NEUT33|Again, this is not financial advice.
NEUT34|I'd love to see what you guys think about this in the comments section below.
