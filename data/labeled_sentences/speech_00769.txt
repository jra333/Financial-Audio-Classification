NEUT0|"""What do you make of the delivery numbers?"
BEAR1|I mean, I realized just shy by a couple hundred of that 500,000 that Musk had forecast, but we also did have a pandemic in the middle of this and some manufacturing key manufacturing shut down too.
BULL2|Sure, look, it's it's a very notable accomplishment to grow units 36% to ramp new facilities.
BULL3|It's a terrific achievement by Tesla.
NEUT4|The question of course always is what was in expectations, and I'm a little surprised the stock is as strong as it is today.
BEAR5|'cause I think most people expected Tesla to be able to deliver against this target, and in fact, there was speculation over the last week that they might eclipse that target.
BULL6|Yeah, I mean the stocks trading up about 5% right now, about $742 a share.
BEAR7|I'm looking at your note, you've got an underperform rating $180.00 price target.
NEUT8|What do you think triggers that?
NEUT9|What do you think?
NEUT10|I guess brings such an incredible dramatic sell off to this stock?
NEUT11|I mean it has been largely Teflon until this point, at least recently.
NEUT12|No, absolutely Morgan.
BULL13|You know the stock is up about 80% since it was included in the S&P or since it was announced that it was going to be included in the S&P and quite frankly, estimates haven't changed at all, nor have you know nor have the company really announced anything material.
BULL14|So the stock is really appreciating.
NEUT15|We believe largely on momentum now.
BEAR16|What reverses that it's very difficult to call.
BEAR17|You know if there's a rotation in the broader marketplace towards value oriented stocks, that could undermine tests and other growth stocks.
BEAR18|I think most importantly, if Tesla is not able to deliver against expectations, you know you'd likely see a material pullback in the stock, and I think expectations are for close to 1,000,000 units in 2021.
NEUT19|The company will on it in all likelihood on its earnings call at the end of the month.
NEUT20|Set its target for the year and we'll see how that stacks up, but but those are really probably the the most material things.
BEAR21|A disappointment in relative to expectations or a broader market rotation away from higher flying growth stocks.
NEUT22|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
