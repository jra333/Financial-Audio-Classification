BULL0|"""Hi guys, hope you're doing well."
NEUT1|Today I've got stock analysis video of the UK Stock S4 capital to try and determine whether it's a good bar.
NEUT2|Not I'm going to give you unnecessary information.
NEUT3|In the shortest amount of time possible.
NEUT4|First of all, what does S woke up to actually do and why do they have an advantage?
NEUT5|S4 Capital, which is a building a purely digital advertising and marketing services business for global multinational, regional, local clients and millennial driven influencer brands.
NEUT6|So basically there an advertising company.
NEUT7|You've got products you want to advertise.
NEUT8|S will capital will take care of that for you to a very high standard.
BULL9|I personally believe S World Capital has an advantage to be very big in this space.
NEUT10|As they found that is so Martin Stewart Sorrow, who is a British businessman and the founder of WPP, the world's largest advertising and PR group, both by revenue and number of staff.
NEUT11|So this guy has done it all before and he's got a new project in S4 Capital.
NEUT12|So why can he not do it again?
BULL13|He should be able to do it again, so that's why I think they have an advantage.
BEAR14|If we take a look at the stock truck here we can see quite a lot of three month period of consolidation around here and obviously with what's going on in the market recently is taking quite a dip.
BULL15|So maybe when the market comes back to normal levels it might find this consolidation line again.
NEUT16|So it's looking like at the minute a good place to get in at this price.
NEUT17|This world capitals market cap is 2.2 billion and according to Simply, Wall Street is changed.
BEAR18|It's trading at 56.8% below its fair value, so that's a good indicator and simply Wall Street very rarely.
BEAR19|Say a growth stock is undervalued, as you can see huge growth here.
NEUT20|If they can meet this number in 2024, which I believe they have a good chance of doing, there's no reason this company can't be worth $10 billion in market cap, which obviously is a 5X from current prices.
BULL21|This is also a company that could possibly expect to get into the Footsie 100 in coming years if we take a look at their balance sheet, we can see they've got debt of 77.7 million in cash and short term investments of 85 million, so they could pay that debt off tomorrow so the balance sheets looking very good in terms of cash runaway it can.
BULL22|Yes, cash went away for more than three years, but maintains its current positive free cash flow level, so hopefully no share dilutions.
BULL23|Also, there's a fair amount of insider buying which looks good for the company.
BULL24|S4 capital are expected to be profitable this year.
BULL25|Thanks for listening, guys.
BULL26|"I hope you enjoyed."""
