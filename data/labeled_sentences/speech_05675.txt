NEUT0|"""OK, what's up everybody?"
NEUT1|I wanted to put out this video right away and this is my first video, but I wanted to put this video out right away because I see something in the market that's different that's different from this past bullmark we have.
NEUT2|Have had and I want to get right to it right now.
NEUT3|This is a six month chart of the S&P 500 and if you notice.
BEAR4|We've been having higher highs and higher lows the whole time right to get right here and then.
BEAR5|We broke down hard.
BEAR6|This is our first lower low, which is it's not too bad.
NEUT7|Only if we make a higher high which we didn't.
NEUT8|Right here we got a upside down hammer.
NEUT9|Inverse hammer, which usually means we're going down so we didn't.
BEAR10|We didn't get new highs here so we got the lower low but we didn't get a higher high.
NEUT11|Now we gotta lower high so you know what that means.
BULL12|That means we're going to have a lower low.
NEUT13|These, I think so.
NEUT14|So if we go down to the weekly chart.
NEUT15|Let's see what's happening to get this crap outta here.
NEUT16|Alright, this is my first video so be patient.
NEUT17|If you look at this.
NEUT18|But as you can see, here's the dip.
NEUT19|We didn't get the higher high, so we're probably going to go down to support, which is right here.
NEUT20|168.88 as to say 168, right?
NEUT21|And look with the 50 day moving averages, also 168.
NEUT22|I'm willing to bet.
BULL23|That this market is going right down here, we're going to find support.
BEAR24|We're going to make a lower low.
NEUT25|And we'll probably settle out right around here at the 168 mark.
NEUT26|So if you've been in this bull market for some time now, you probably want to take some profits.
BEAR27|I think we're going to go down pretty hard.
NEUT28|And you got this.
NEUT29|Stuff going on in Ukraine or whatever the country is is fighting or whatever is going on.
NEUT30|Who knows, who knows.
BEAR31|Whatever the reason is, but I don't like the fact that we didn't make a higher high.
BEAR32|So since we made the lower low and we did make a higher high, we got a lower high.
BEAR33|1st as a real real real real good sign that we're going down the next support level right here at 168.
NEUT34|Thanks for watching this video.
NEUT35|Please tune in.
NEUT36|I'm going to have more videos like this.
BULL37|"Appreciate it trading scared amount."""
