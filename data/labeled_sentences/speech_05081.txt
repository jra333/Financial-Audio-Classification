NEUT1|Be telling you why you should invest in Netflix as a stock.
NEUT2|So Netflix is a streaming service that allows viewers to watch an assortment of TV shows and movies ranging from reality to horror.
NEUT3|Netflix is ad free but requires a monthly subscription.
NEUT4|The reason you should buy Netflix are recent one.
BEAR5|Netflix has been popular for ages now, but his recently taken a big jump because of the Corona virus.
BEAR6|Now that people are stuck at home, they watch a lot more TV and since so many people have a Netflix subscription subscription, they're using this resulting in higher stocks for Netflix.
NEUT7|And of course, this is clearly an reason.
NEUT8|Two is, Netflix has this deal with T-Mobile, and that means that those on the T-Mobile subscription get a free subscription Netflix, they can watch it on their own.
NEUT9|And Netflix is now getting viewers from both T-Mobile subscription people and people who just found Netflix and really wanted to watch it.
NEUT10|And.
NEUT11|Netflix is currently worth.
NEUT12|$475.
BEAR13|And it went down like drastically today how it went from $489.00 to $475.
NEUT14|But this is just in a day, but it's been going upwards from month three months a year and five years so that you can see it started at around $109 and built its way up.
BEAR15|To $475, the only time it really dipped was.
BEAR16|Really didn't make it wasn't that bad in the stock market crash for here, it's just another dip.
NEUT17|As you can see.
BEAR18|There, there's even worse tips over here.
NEUT19|This is just this is the stock market crash.
NEUT20|This is also the stock market crash, but if you look at it from this Netflix's entire story, it's only a little a smaller blemish in its entire thing, so that's a good sign 67% of people buy this, which is still a majority.
NEUT21|21% of people hold it and only 12% of people sell it.
BULL22|This is a pretty good start to invest in.
