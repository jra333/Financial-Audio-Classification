BULL0|"""Well, Jagdeep, you're doing it."
BULL1|You got a better lithium back, better battery than the lithium you've got.
NEUT2|It's heavier than lithium batteries, heavier, they catch fire.
NEUT3|They don't get you enough distance an you, on the other hand, I've got one.
NEUT4|And you and the other end got white versus that.
NEUT5|What kind of battery?
NEUT6|Oh yeah.
NEUT7|Yeah, you know actually so.
NEUT8|So the quantum scape solid state battery addresses the five big problems, many of which you addressed him.
NEUT9|So it has more edge density, which gives you longer range for a given charge.
NEUT10|It has more power density, which gives you faster charge.
NEUT11|That's the 15 minute charge that you referenced.
NEUT12|It's it's actually safer because it consists of noncombustible nonflammable elements.
NEUT13|Unlike conventional batteries that you mentioned it, the cycle life is better 'cause you don't have the reactive elements that you have one conventional.
NEUT14|Notes and you get all that without having to pay more because you get those benefits by simplifying the battery and illuminating the traditional carbon or carbon Silicon anode.
NEUT15|So actually ends up being lower costs.
NEUT16|You pull out together.
NEUT17|We know in one fell swoop.
NEUT18|With that one change of going from the liquid based design to a solid state design you can address all five of those limitations.
NEUT19|And yeah, that's why that's why this approach is is better and you did you discuss this today to support these claims were discussed and presented an incredible cyantific death never.
NEUT20|With never before shared proof points, this must be why Volkswagen decided to give you guys $100 million in your partner.
NEUT21|That's exactly right.
NEUT22|In fact, the data has in fact never been seen before.
NEUT23|People have tried to do it for, you know, in some mid 70s, but the idea of hitting all those requirements simultaneously, right?
NEUT24|You gotta get high charge rates without shorting the cell.
NEUT25|You gotta get them.
NEUT26|Oh, temperature operation, you gotta get long life, high density, all those things together is what makes it hard.
NEUT27|You know experts called the end problem of salsa batteries.
NEUT28|And that's exactly why the automotive OEM's including folks wagon have gotten so excited.
NEUT29|And by the way, VW is put in over $300 million.
NEUT30|Not not just $100, so there there pretty much all in and and and in addition to that, they announced that you know there together with US funding a manufacturing joint venture to help bring these batteries to the mass market.
BULL31|So it's a very exciting partnership.
