NEUT0|"""The president at a rally last night brought up the subject of a doctor, fouchy, and an interesting exchange took place."
NEUT1|Let's take a listen.
NEUT2|Don't tell anybody, but let me wait till a little bit after the election.
BULL3|I appreciate the advice.
BULL4|I appreciate.
NEUT5|Now he's been wrong a lot.
NEUT6|He's a nice man, though he's been wrong and allowed.
NEUT7|Do not under any circumstances wear a mask, he said.
NEUT8|Do not close up to China, he said.
BEAR9|Of course it comes after Felci said we are in for a world of hurt on Friday.
BULL10|Saying that we could not be more poorly positioned in this country.
NEUT11|Jim, he's a career point.
BEAR12|It's not clear the president can do anything about his employment status, but I wonder whether or not you think the firing quote unquote of fouchy will be positive for a market that would see.
NEUT13|Lockdown is even less likely.
NEUT14|Oh man, I hadn't.
NEUT15|Who does not have great respect for man in his late 70s who was just doing everything in Canada to try to stop this?
NEUT16|But would it people?
BULL17|I think that anything that signals that you don't listen to the scientists is positive for market because there's enough companies that will benefit that well 'cause they stay open.
NEUT18|Remember, if you follow the science you have to close the bars and restaurants you have to there is anyone who doesn't think that you any scientist who thinks that those should stay open.
NEUT19|So the president if he fires fouchy that means.
NEUT20|What he says is basically science does matter.
NEUT21|So let's just keep the bars and restaurants open, which have been every time you see them, you see hot spots.
NEUT22|You know Dave look, I owned a bar and a restaurant and I came to believe that you could have outdoor right, but it's real cold.
NEUT23|No one wants to eat wearing a parka.
NEUT24|I mean, I did it on Saturday night.
NEUT25|You did.
NEUT26|Yeah I did.
NEUT27|I did.
NEUT28|4540 forty can you can go that low.
NEUT29|I think when you're wearing your you know also.
NEUT30|I mean, there's other things you can do if you need to go to it, but do you have hot chocolate?
NEUT31|But yeah, you just, you know you can wear your coat.
NEUT32|You keep a hat.
NEUT33|Hats are always good, right?
NEUT34|Carl?
BULL35|Thankfully, going to be warm this week.
NEUT36|But listen, New York is an outlier.
BEAR37|It's got a 1.5% positivity rate right now, which is amongst the lowest in the country.
NEUT38|Best versus you know, other place is where and by the way, they've limited indoor dining and bars as well.
NEUT39|Whereas other places have much higher rates, Carl found that was interesting about bars is you couldn't have anybody at the bar like Ilabor Ann.
NEUT40|You allowed anybody at the bar, which therefore made it so it was not a tenuous tenuous that doesn't work.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
