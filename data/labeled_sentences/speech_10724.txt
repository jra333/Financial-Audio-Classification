BULL0|"""I think what separates this recovery is a huge amount of savings that we have coming out of the recession."
NEUT1|The second thing is a cyclical economy, but autos and housing are booming and ultimately I think you're going to see more corporate investment if you think about what happened in Texas with the power down there.
BULL2|People are going to want to build resiliency.
NEUT3|You think about some of the issues in China in the US on trade trade Wars, people are going to reinvent their supply chains and so all that's going to lead to stronger.
NEUT4|Anything that's happening in time.
NEUT5|When monetary policy's been quite accommodative in festival is, as you guys have been reporting correctly isn't quite extraordinary.
NEUT6|So so given that backdrop, where do you want to be investing right now?
NEUT7|Henry?
NEUT8|What parts of the market?
NEUT9|Yeah, it's great question.
NEUT10|So I mean, obviously we're a global forum.
BULL11|I think Asians leading the recovery so we continue to be very focused on Asia in terms of real estate, infrastructure, private equity and even credit.
BULL12|And then what we're really seeing as as companies are doing better, they're starting to reposition their footprints.
NEUT13|Everything a lot of corporate carve outs take place globally in the private equity world.
NEUT14|I think one of the big things we talked on investors about it.
NEUT15|Focus on as a team is around more of a cyclical recovery, this time for the past decade, every time you had economic growth, all you wanted to do was to fade that.
NEUT16|And by secular growth stocks.
NEUT17|And that's really why you ended up with this concentrated Fang.
NEUT18|Stocks that you guys have been reporting on and what's happening right now.
NEUT19|I saw Michaels.
NEUT20|Before his comments before about the big boom in the small caps mean that's what we're saying, right?
NEUT21|We are in 200 companies.
BULL22|Globally, we're seeing a real improvement in in the kind of small to mid size companies that are benefiting on the good side and what's encouraging right now is we're seeing services start to come back, and that's probably going to accelerate as vaccines getting rolled out more, not only in the US but in Europe, where growth has been a little more capital.
NEUT23|Henry, you mentioned, briefly infrastructure.
NEUT24|What does that really entail in terms of investment opportunity right now?
NEUT25|Is it tide to you know whatever government program might come out or or you know, is it about, you know, just investing in real assets that already exist out there.
NEUT26|Yeah, so really what we're seeing from from our Purge is this huge energy transition.
NEUT27|We estimated it's a $3 trillion annual spend as people go away from carbon force renewable and I can play that multiple ways and look, China, the US and Europe don't agree on many things, but all three of them are barreling down the road to improve their carbon footprint, and so that's a very exciting being included when Mike is just rolling around on fiber a lot of times people think about infrastructure.
BEAR28|Slower growth industry.
NEUT29|What we're seeing is anything but that.
BEAR30|If you think about data usage, it's exploding.
NEUT31|That helps data centers.
NEUT32|If you think about fiber in the ground towers, those are all growth areas where we've had a really strong investment deployment phase.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
