NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Daniel's and today we're gonna talk about Fisker and a little bit about Sparks and if you don't know it is a beautiful car made by Henrik Fisker and also he participated in this car Aston Martin DB9 and BMW's at 8 and now his care."
NEUT1|It is a public company with Ticker S Air.
NEUT2|Stranded on a nice and actually it was a spark spark.
NEUT3|It is special Purpose acquisition Company and Spartan Energy acquisition.
NEUT4|Corporate is a spark and spark is the company without commercial operations and it made only for make money on IPO and then buy some campaigning and with the overflow that manipulations.
NEUT5|Now if this Corona around $1 billion in cash, and I think with this amount of money as they can produce the cars, Fisker have lots of experience in building cars, and now their partnership with Magna.
NEUT6|And now the stock cost only $11.00.
BULL7|I think it is cheaper and maybe it will be a good idea to buy.
BEAR8|Some long call options on the stock because we have unreal amount of hype around electric vehicles.
NEUT9|It is Tesla, it is near.
NEUT10|It is workhorse hand.
NEUT11|Then as a campaign, yeah so.
NEUT12|But from the other site are we have some risks when someone is using Spark to go public and we definitely have some.
NEUT13|A risk, because if you're using spark to go public as it means that you couldn't pass checker Commission to just go public over normal IPO and in 90% of cases you have some problems with money or management or your company.
NEUT14|Just fake.
NEUT15|Don't forget about this risk when you will buy Fisker now, they're not producing.
NEUT16|Anything could and as they are planning to deliver, first occurs in fourth quarter 2022, but I hope that Henrik Fisker will make something great because the first two companies fill it for bankruptcy.
