NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take a look at the Apple stock and we can see today I performed a green candle and this green candle has a upper tail."
BEAR1|That means the resistance upset and it has been hesitate to break out from the yummies.
BEAR2|So is the weakness and the various system has been shown.
BULL3|And as we can see the after hour, Apple declared the profit in the country and it seems that Apple has a strong set of Mac.
NEUT4|And iPad, but it's not enough to.
BEAR5|Offset the decline in the iPhone, which is the major product of the company.
BEAR6|So after the announcement, the price of the stock has dropped nearly 4%, so it's roughly already touched the 110 level.
NEUT7|So in my opinion.
BEAR8|This up tail is a weakness sign and after the announcement the stock dropped.
BULL9|Another 4% is to the low over here 110 so it has made a new law actually.
BEAR10|So in my opinion it's a bearish sign for the stock so it will continue in his downtrend.
NEUT11|So let's wait and see what will happen.
BULL12|"Thank you."""
