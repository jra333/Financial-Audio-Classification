NEUT0|"""But in a GameStop continue, I'm rich, what's happening remains."
NEUT1|Oh well, it's all game site like they brought me on to talk about Microsoft, Walgreens, and a bunch of other stocks that no one really cares about today.
NEUT2|John, but look and we talk about not only the moves in GameStop and really the after hour moves that we saw yesterday.
NEUT3|I mean, I was on here yesterday when Elon Musk had that one line tweet about game stunk.
NEUT4|And of course the stock just took off basically doubled in after hours trading here and up about doubled here in premarket trading, but there is a bigger story here.
NEUT5|This isn't really just about.
NEUT6|The pajama traders and the folks on Reddit duking it out with the Big Dogs.
NEUT7|This is about the Big Dogs duking it out with the Big Dogs.
NEUT8|You talk about Melvin Capital and then really getting caught up in this.
NEUT9|Sure, yeah, there was definitely a group of individual retail traders that definitely went after this short.
NEUT10|The Melvin Capital had the Melvin Capital needed help from getting bailed out from.
NEUT11|But there were also a lot of big players in this from the Ryan Cohen from the Michael Berry's a lot of people who were long GameStop and they were long GameStop because of fundamentals.
NEUT12|Now do those fundamentals get you 2 to $300 a share?
NEUT13|Probably not.
NEUT14|Romaine I'm looking at it now.
NEUT15|Maybe we can get the pre market up here so we can take a look at it right now at 2:38 yeah and romaine.
NEUT16|It's all the same.
NEUT17|Whether it's Gamma DA beta, whatever.
NEUT18|The Greek letters that Sheldon Natan Berg taught us years ago and the bottom line is when you end the losing short money has to appear to cover the trade.
NEUT19|Are we at a moment this day where money is going to appear on losses?
NEUT20|Yeah, it's starting to look that and look.
NEUT21|I mean this has been driven by the options market.
NEUT22|You talk about those Greek letters in this type of squeeze that you see.
NEUT23|I'll put on some of these will basically put on the dealers, which helps to sort of drive the stock up.
NEUT24|If you're on the short side of that trade then you end up like a Melvin capital where you got to close out that position.
NEUT25|You got to close it out fast and a lot of times you gotta find cash to close it out.
NEUT26|There's not already on your balance sheet there, So what you're seeing now here is this.
NEUT27|Play out in the options market and we always put up these charts here showing the the issue.
NEUT28|The price on the intraday stock here, but really pay attention to the volume that's out there in the options market now we point out we saw a record volume on Friday, something like 2.2 billion traded on Friday.
NEUT29|I think it was one and a half billion yesterday on GameStop, but I should point out that when you look at the put to call ratio Tom, we're still a little like something like a 2.2.
NEUT30|So you do the math.
NEUT31|Whatever you learn back when you got your CFA 50 years ago, that tells you that right now they're actually more puts in this market.
NEUT32|Then there are calls right now remain Bostick secures an invite so so you have so for every person for every person out there.
NEUT33|That's betting on this stock to go higher.
NEUT34|You got just as many people right now.
NEUT35|On the short side of this trade romaine, just to close this out in a sort of wrap this up.
NEUT36|The big debate here it was.
NEUT37|A compliment idiot syncratic oh, I'm sure it was.
NEUT38|You can convince him of that later.
NEUT39|Is how much of this is idiosyncratic and how much has a broader impact on the market?
NEUT40|Yes, there are a lot of technical factors here, but how much are we seeing?
NEUT41|For example, some of the favourites of hedge funds, long stocks, the long positions getting sold off in order to cover these shorts to Tom's position earlier, there's yeah, there's two parts to this.
NEUT42|I've been asking this question of every guest here and the general consensus seems to be that the systemic risk there to the market just is not there.
NEUT43|That this is really confined to the game stops in the expresses in the causes, and a few of the other sort of short stocks that are.
NEUT44|Short squeezes out there as far as whether it's taking money away from an attention away from the Microsoft's and some of the other stocks that might be getting bids here, but there seems to be evidence that that is the case.
NEUT45|Remember, this may not be the case so much with a Microsoft, but when you look at sort of the next tear down, you look at the pelotons and the zooms of the world that had been bid up and bid up for relatively decent reasons.
BEAR46|There is a sense here that those stocks really aren't getting the attention right now.
NEUT47|Retail traders now are focused on what, at least for the moment, seems like easy money, easy money, easy money.
NEUT48|I I have trouble aggregating all of these ANX to me is just a short trade in the derivative build up.
NEUT49|But I could be wrong on that.
NEUT50|Romain Bostic numerous times with us this morning.
NEUT51|"Here information."""
