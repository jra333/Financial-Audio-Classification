NEUT0|"""Hey there, Jason Moser analyst with Motley Fool."
NEUT1|One thanks for joining us for another edition of Ask a fool today we're taking a question from Cheryl and Cheryl asks I have some cash to reinvest as the cash is sitting in my money market.
NEUT2|I'm 56 years old and trying to set myself up for retirement recently in advisor gave me the Edward Jones prospectus that calls for a 1.4% load fee and monthly fees there after my husband says that's too much money.
NEUT3|What say you?
NEUT4|While Cheryl, I'll say this, your husband's a smart man, I think he's right.
BEAR5|I tend to agree that a 1.4% load along with monthly monthly fees thereafter those will definitely eat into your returns.
NEUT6|You're closer toward the protecting your wealth.
NEUT7|Part of your investing life as opposed to the growing your wealth part of you want to take that in consideration in regard to the funds that you invest in.
NEUT8|But first I want to make sure that you understand that whatever funds you do put your money in.
NEUT9|Make sure if you put your money into the market.
NEUT10|This is Money that you're not going to be at least five years.
NEUT11|You don't ever want to get caught in the position of being a desperate seller.
NEUT12|Now from there, I actually would recommend checking out vanguards different fund options.
NEUT13|You know, one of the keystones to the Vanguard philosophy is keeping costs for the individual investor low.
NEUT14|They tend to have no loads at all, along with very low expense ratios that will.
NEUT15|That will help sort of keep your returns in check without having those fees eat into your returns too much and you know on average, Vanguard mutual fund expense ratios are 82% less than the.
NEUT16|Industry average and if you look at what the expense ratio is, that's basically just the annualized cost of maintaining the fund, right?
NEUT17|I mean, their management fees and marketing fees, administrative fees that are associated with any fun, but Vanguard chooses to keep these fees very low for the customer.
BULL18|Low fees and excellent performance.
BULL19|Overtime wins them loyal customers, and certainly they do have excellent performance overtime.
NEUT20|So what I would say is Google Vanguard.
NEUT21|Check out the different funds they have out there in a Vanguard isn't the only option, but it's certainly a very good one, but.
NEUT22|Either way, you want to make sure to focus on keeping those fees low or eliminate them completely, but it's a great question.
