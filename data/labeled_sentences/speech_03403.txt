NEUT0|"""It's claim this via video chart on ticker symbol FCEL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one and a disappointing day.
NEUT5|Now let me emphasize the word day when I say day, I mean just today.
NEUT6|Individually, I don't mean the entire chart or anything like that, and the reason why today and I'm sure you understand why today was not so good as I mean, the thing started off just an absolute beast mode, just crushing upwards, crushing upwards, crushing upwards, and then all of a sudden.
NEUT7|Rolled back over and went right back to where it started.
NEUT8|So yeah, today.
BEAR9|Not a very good day at all.
NEUT10|In fact, relatively bearish day in some senses, but let's now focus on more than just a day.
NEUT11|And let's look at multiple days.
BEAR12|Or in other words, the bigger picture viewpoint and you can see that as disappointing as today was, the overall trend is still perfectly fine.
BULL13|The overall trend is still put in higher bases.
BULL14|I mean, even when you look at the lower trim today, still managed to stay above that area.
NEUT15|And if you look at those lows right there and then, those lows right here and then, you know the lowest get even lower.
NEUT16|And if you envision those as their steps.
NEUT17|Well then from the big picture point of view, stair steps still plenty in the bowl instruction.
NEUT18|Again, I realize if you are a day trader an you bought right there this morning, your plan was to buy and sell within 7 minutes.
BEAR19|Well, yeah, from that point of view, from that perspective the chart looks really bad and things are not looking so good at all.
NEUT20|But again, that's why I'm trying to really emphasize that there is a differentiation between today and then multiple days because it really that's going to dictate how you should be looking at this chart.
NEUT21|Whether this chart is bullish or bearish to you as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
BULL22|Definitely got confirmation that this area right up here.
BEAR23|At $19.00 is going to be a very stubborn area of resistance.
BULL24|Yet today the price did actually get up through there temporarily, but that didn't last very long and then back down the prices went.
NEUT25|So 19 remains.
NEUT26|Public Enemy number one headed forward, but the week is young, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL30|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT36|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
