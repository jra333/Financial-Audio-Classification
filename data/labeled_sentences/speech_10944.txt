NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see here.
BEAR2|I performed a dodgy yesterday during your training time and with a compatible smaller volume.
NEUT3|So if we checked pattern we can see here Apple tried to make a consolidation and hear a small base has been found.
NEUT4|Small base has a low of one or three .10 and it never make a new law.
BULL5|Other than this, so in short term we can see the stock price has been stabilized, but if we check the volume we can see.
NEUT6|The volume is not so strong, so in my opinion.
NEUT7|The best scenario for Apple stock is to make consolidation along this line.
NEUT8|And not go back up too soon, so the pessimistic.
NEUT9|Analyzes will say it still has possibility.
NEUT10|To retest the 103 point because it's only one test, it needs another test.
NEUT11|To confirm the support is valid.
NEUT12|So in my opinion is not a good time to buy Apple stock at this moment.
BULL13|"Thank you."""
