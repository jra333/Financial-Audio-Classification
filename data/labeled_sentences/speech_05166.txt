NEUT0|"""He did this exact with Achilles financial, and I've got a quick video for you here today because we just talked about DMYD, which is Genius Sports Group."
NEUT1|They are the spec that's taking them public, which is the DMY Technology group is taking genius sports public an I wanted to highlight because we just talked about that because they just announced that merger date information.
NEUT2|They also, as you can see here on Twitter, they just announced that they have a official partnership with the NFL.
NEUT3|Now during our last video we talked about their existing.
NEUT4|Partnerships which include a number of organizations across the soccer community.
NEUT5|For those of you in the United States Football Community overseas.
NEUT6|The reason why it's so important is because they are the dominant force overseas in regards to data analytics.
NEUT7|They utilized this data for a number of different betting apps.
NEUT8|Think DraftKings, think, FanDuel, think flutter.
NEUT9|Huge behind the scenes.
BULL10|Not only was this a big win for them from a revenue perspective, but this is big for them.
BULL11|In terms of this was one of the largest deals for sport radar, which is their largest competitor.
BULL12|This is awesome.
NEUT13|I am a huge fan again as a Holder of the stock and have been consistently talking bout them.
BULL14|It's great to see them have this big kind of upwards push after hours.
NEUT15|Let's talk about it.
NEUT16|So as you can see here on the screen, we're looking at DMY Technology Group or DMYD.
NEUT17|This is again this back taking genius groups public.
NEUT18|It's one we've been covering.
BULL19|Since last November you can see that after hours move again already a decent update today because they were up 6%.
BULL20|Now they're up over 25% after hours.
NEUT21|The reason for this?
NEUT22|The reason this is a big deal is because they estimate that this is going to be a billion dollar deal for them over the course of multiple years this relationship has been finalized.
NEUT23|The deal has been finalized, but the terms of that deal have not come out yet.
NEUT24|The reason why this is such a big deal for them is because Horizon.
NEUT25|Which is the group taking the.
NEUT26|Sportradar public is not doing so hot.
BEAR27|You can see that they've dropped 5% after hours all the way down to the expected acquisition price of right at $10 a share for this particular SPAC.
NEUT28|They've had the acquisition, or they, sorry, they've had their relationship with the NFL going all the way back to 2015.
NEUT29|So this is a big deal for them.
BULL30|Missing out on this deal and for that reason I'm happy.
BULL31|I think that Sportradar is the lesser of the two powers in this space and I think that this bodes very well for DMYD going forward.
NEUT32|Keep in mind that that ticker symbol is going to change to GE in I later this month pending the vote that happens on the 16th.
NEUT33|The expected merger date is April 20th, so if you'd like to see some of the other information I've compiled on this group, I will drop that down in the description below as well as.
