BEAR0|"""Hey guys, we got one more bad news, Mr Rollinson said on CNBC that there will be a delay in delivery of vehicles."
NEUT1|They did it intentionally because they will might fail.
BULL2|He also talked about rapid growth valuation.
NEUT3|We will talk about it if their vehicle will not sell CCI we will touch lower levels.
BEAR4|However I think that at some point in near future lucid is going to deliver a fine car but the CEO just today revealed that another delay in the delivery of their first production vehicle.
NEUT5|Now to second half of this year in the interview, his explanation seems to reveal they don't have the perfect car, yet.
BULL6|I am generally patient with investment in a good company, but this company has been well funded an had a few years to get a car launch.
NEUT7|I'm concerned that either the CEO has fear to launch or that the car isn't everything.
NEUT8|It should be for the price, or maybe a little of both if they will launch their vehicle now and if the sales will be down.
NEUT9|In that case, their stock price will go down to its real value.
NEUT10|I'm not touching this back, but I understand that many even investors will.
NEUT11|I'm going to sit by the sidelines until I can see how this thing trade.
NEUT12|For few months I might wait for the sell off between now an medium and then try to run up to the first car delivery because their vehicles are so costly.
BULL13|He also talked about rapid revenue growth plan.
BULL14|Listed expects to achieve rapid revenue growth.
NEUT15|It will begin selling significant number of vehicles next year.
BULL16|More specifically, Lucid expects to be able to an sell 20,000 cars and 2022.
NEUT17|49,000 in 2023 and many as five Lacs cars a year.
NEUT18|Including the air, the gravity activity and the future models by 2030, according to Bloomberg.
BULL19|Revenue will ramp up from 97 million two in 2021 to nearly 23.8 billion in 2026 until Lucid generates.
BEAR20|It's a bitter off 637,000,000 in 2025 and nearly 1.8 billion in 2026 lives it Chief Lucid Chief Executive Officer Peter Rawlinson told Bloomberg.
NEUT21|I see this pack as just a tool, another level to Poland, where we can excelerate our trajectory.
NEUT22|This is a technology race.
NEUT23|Tesla get the technology, that's why they are selling.
NEUT24|That's why they are so valuable.
NEUT25|Anne Lucid has got the technology now lives.
NEUT26|It can turn these dreams into reality.
NEUT27|If you want to go along with this.
BULL28|Potential bumpy, high speed right.
NEUT29|I'm pretty sure that it would be a bumpy ride for sure.
NEUT30|I bought 200 shares at 17.
NEUT31|I will hold it for the long term.
NEUT32|I will not invest more than 2% of my overall foot fully up.
NEUT33|In the end I would just like to say that their vehicles are so costly whether they will sell or not.
NEUT34|No one can predict the future.
NEUT35|I will see whether their vehicles are selling or not an after some good sales number.
NEUT36|I will think to add more.
NEUT37|Not now.
NEUT38|"I will hold my position."""
