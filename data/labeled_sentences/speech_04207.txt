NEUT0|"""Next guest, he tweeted on Tuesday that he'd gone long through call options."
NEUT1|Chamath Poly Apatia is the CEO Social Capital.
NEUT2|He joins us now on the phone.
BULL3|Shama, thank you for being here.
BULL4|Hi Scott, how are you?
BULL5|I'm good thanks.
NEUT6|So you tweeted yesterday that you bought $115.00 calls in GameStop.
NEUT7|Can you tell me what your position is as of this very moment?
NEUT8|Yeah can I?
NEUT9|Can I tell you a little story before all of that or no, why don't you tell me that first and then we'll go from there?
NEUT10|So this morning I woke up after spending all time all last night in wallstreetbets reading about all of this stuff, I ended up closing up my position this morning and I wanted to announce.
NEUT11|That I'm taking all the profits that I made plus my original position, so I'm going to take $500,000 and I'm going to donate to the Barstool Fund for small businesses.
NEUT12|But I really want to tell you, beyond the 500 grand donation or the the money that I invested, which is, you know, not a huge amount in the grand scheme of back stock or the entire market.
NEUT13|What I learned, 'cause I think what I learned over the last couple of days is important for everybody that's watching CNBC.
NEUT14|And that is.
NEUT15|I think that what you're seeing is essentially a pushback against the establishment in a really important way.
NEUT16|You have a lot of people, and I would encourage anybody who is dismissive of this thing to go into Wall Street bets and actually just read the forums.
NEUT17|And I think that you're going to see.
NEUT18|Three kinds of posts.
NEUT19|The first kind of content are a lot of people doing some incredible fundamental diligence on companies.
BULL20|Trying to think about long term value and in my opinion many of them are doing as good and frankly a better job than a lot of hedge fund analysts that I work with.
NEUT21|That's number one.
NEUT22|The second or a lot of people who believe that you know, coming out of 2008.
NEUT23|What happened was Wall Street took an enormous amount of risk.
NEUT24|And they left retail is the bag Holder and a lot of these kids were in grade school and high school.
BEAR25|When that happened they lost their homes.
BEAR26|Their parents lost their jobs and they've always wondered, like why did those folks get bailed out for taking enormous amounts of risk and nobody helped and showed up to help my family.
NEUT27|And then the third thing is a realization that instead of having idea dinners or you know quiet whispered conversations amongst hedge funds in the Hamptons, these kids have the courage to do it transparently in a forum.
NEUT28|And I'm not saying all of it is perfect by any means.
NEUT29|"But I think it takes an enormous amount of faith in the system to be that transparent, to talk about things, and then through each individual to make their own mind up and to do things, whether it's to buy in to sell."""
