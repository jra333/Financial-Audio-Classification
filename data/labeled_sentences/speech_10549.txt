NEUT0|"""We announced this morning that we posted last night minus previous between the NIH team and the modern a scientist."
NEUT1|Looking at those new variants, especially the 117 first found in the UK and B 351 was found in South Africa.
NEUT2|The great news.
BULL3|We both virus we see very high level of antibody.
BULL4|We were beat strength from the UK.
NEUT5|We basically see the same level of antibody as we saw in the in the strain that has been circulating in the US.
BULL6|As Moderna this morning, announcing results of neutralization that they say Jim remains above levels that are expected to be protective against these new variants.
NEUT7|Although out of an abundance of caution, they're launching a clinical program on some boosters.
NEUT8|Yeah, I mean, I I took, that's the one I've taken half of.
NEUT9|Then I will take the other half next month.
NEUT10|And of course you all wish that they would give you that one.
NEUT11|But what we just talked about, but the fact is, is a very effective vaccine look.
NEUT12|Everybody knows that if you get it even.
NEUT13|If you get you, you get coded with the shot.
NEUT14|The kovit is very light so I'm not saying that this can stop everything but David.
BULL15|The prospects are pretty good if you come in contact, which is great.
BEAR16|Other good news is, of course hospitalizations, nationwide or down cases are down seven day average, at least about 173 thousand, down from 144 thousand.
BULL17|That's good.
NEUT18|Still real questions about vaccine distribution, what we're going to be able to get to an.
NEUT19|Obviously Jim still concern about these new variants, which are more transmissible, and Scott Gottlieb was Gottlieb, was making a good point this morning.
NEUT20|I thought, saying, well, given.
NEUT21|The how they, the reasons why they're more transmissible, it would make sense that they may in fact also be unfortunately more.
BEAR22|I think he said pathogenic but just deadly right now.
NEUT23|This is 1 where the people who are involved with with view it as an aerosol issue.
BULL24|This is good.
NEUT25|I don't mean to make this tougher for people at home, but the mask you need isn't N 95 and that is the special one that has a better filter now.
NEUT26|They don't let the filters that are plastic on planes so you have to get an in 95 that doesn't have that but.
NEUT27|Check to see what your mask is.
BULL28|If it's N 95, it's going to do a lot better against these additional strains because this one is easier to catch if you're just wearing a scarf.
NEUT29|If you're just wearing any kind of covering that is got something that doesn't repel the air sole, so quarrel it should.
NEUT30|It should make people feel twice about what their what the face covering, but if you don't have a face come, it just seems like you're going to get it.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
