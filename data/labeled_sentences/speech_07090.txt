NEUT0|"""Yellow corporations this pretty much this stock is a very very small cap and it's technically it's a penny stock, but it's a legit company with logistics."
NEUT1|They provide logistics and pretty much transportation services.
NEUT2|Locali I believe, and also their international as well.
NEUT3|And they have according to their.
NEUT4|Description of the company they say that they provide less than truckload network in North America Locali and they say also it's international company.
NEUT5|And one thing I like about this stock right here right now is its float and its market capitalization.
NEUT6|This is a small cap 388,000,000 market capitalization with only fifty million outstanding shares.
BULL7|This is a pretty good.
BULL8|Some momentum could be pretty good.
NEUT9|Momentum stock if we see this volume.
BULL10|Persistent volume is pretty big today.
NEUT11|Let's have a look at the chart.
NEUT12|I'm going to zoom out to daily chart so we can see what's going on here.
BEAR13|So this stock was on my watch list for some time and it was pretty much popping and fading away.
NEUT14|And also we chopped a lot right here and now.
NEUT15|Finally, this stock is above $7.00 and also this stock is above this trendline as white trendline.
NEUT16|And another thing I like about this stock is that it has a lot of call buying activity at the moment 11,000 calls purchased so far today and only 700 puts and it was coming in even back in I think on Friday.
NEUT17|Let's have a look at the call buying activity.
NEUT18|I'm going to go to let's say let's take a look at the seven dollars strike or five dollar strike price and.
NEUT19|I'm going to zoom into daily chart even when stock was chopping around.
NEUT20|There are lot of people coming in.
NEUT21|Look at this size.
NEUT22|Big big buyers.
NEUT23|Let's have a look at the $6 strike price even on Friday when this stock was sitting right here at the lows.
NEUT24|There were people buying decent size calls for this stock and also look at this one right here.
NEUT25|Let's have a look at the seven dollars strike price.
NEUT26|It is pretty much.
NEUT27|Bullish all around.
NEUT28|Also, they don't have shares to borrow.
NEUT29|Let's right here.
NEUT30|If you take a look at the.
NEUT31|NTB which means no shares to borrow HDTV, usually GameStop.
NEUT32|Let's have a look at the games that hard to borrow.
NEUT33|OK, you can't borrow to short a stock.
NEUT34|No shares to borrow which means nobody can short this stock.
NEUT35|So you can only play it long.
NEUT36|At least with my brokerage there's no shares to borrow so I'm watching this stock to the upside it's looking very, very bullish if it stays above this trendline.
NEUT37|$7.30 I'm looking to play this name to the upside.
NEUT38|At the moment I don't have any position.
NEUT39|I don't have shares.
NEUT40|I don't have contracts, but if I play this name, most likely I'm going to play it with options to the upside.
NEUT41|So I'm watching this penny stock to the upside just given the volume and given the market capitalization of this stock, I believe this can.
NEUT42|This stock came double or triple in a matter of very very short period of time.
NEUT43|So I'm watching this name to the upside for the rest of the March and for the rest of this quarter.
BULL44|Thanks for watching.
NEUT45|Don't forget to like subscribe and I'll see you in the next one.
NEUT46|"Take care."""
