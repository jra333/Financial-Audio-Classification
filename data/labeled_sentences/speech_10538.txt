NEUT0|"""I wonder if you think that lead this morning is are these loss provisions, especially at JPMorgan."
BEAR1|Well look, I I, I am surprised positively and I think that what's happened is people aren't spending that borrowing a credit card losses fine and this small business loans.
NEUT2|I don't know where the people are that they are not suffering.
NEUT3|This is.
NEUT4|It's not a happy days are here again.
BULL5|It's just maybe JP Morgan's landing better now I will say this.
NEUT6|And David knows this, there will be a call that goes on simultaneously when we talk about it, and that call is going to take the wind out of our sails.
NEUT7|David, if we say something really positive because they'll be one comment and will be some comment that comes out in that call.
NEUT8|And this has happened again and again, which is made us pull in our horns.
NEUT9|I'm frantically trying to figure out which one they're going to say.
BEAR10|That is not great.
NEUT11|Then I do my background call with City.
BULL12|Its cities quarter looks amazing and you've got the $71.95.
NEUT13|Book value and It scrub book value, but that seems to be impossible.
NEUT14|So David, you know in this day of days that you and I always just like 'cause we're going over these quarters.
BEAR15|There's something in these numbers that someone will not like and that is typically sent JP Morgan down in City with it has not been able to keep a lead, that's for sure.
NEUT16|Neither one of the stocks, even during earnings days.
NEUT17|You say I remember the last last quarter.
BEAR18|It appeared that they were both quite strong, but they did not stay strong in terms of the stock market.
NEUT19|At least Jim, to your point.
NEUT20|Sometimes it is.
NEUT21|Comments on the calls as you say that perhaps are more concerning.
NEUT22|We don't know what's coming.
NEUT23|We don't and they don't when it comes to future provisions for loan losses.
BULL24|But that said, I mean, JP Morgan is actually releasing a lot of reserves.
BEAR25|The provision came in well below it had been anticipated.
BULL26|The weakness that you've been concerned about his not showed itself.
NEUT27|It wouldn't seem on the consumer or even on the corporate front.
NEUT28|Not that we were expecting that much there.
NEUT29|It's just not there, Jim, not to mention of course, deposits are extraordinary, of 28 percent, 28% of JP Morgan.
NEUT30|I think what was it?
NEUT31|1617 at city?
NEUT32|I think yeah.
BEAR33|I mean, people aren't spending and therefore their balance sheets are getting better.
NEUT34|That's something I did not count on.
NEUT35|That, and one reason it didn't count Enquanto make this clear is the Fed scared that.
BEAR36|Scared the living daylights out of me.
NEUT37|One of the things that they have said is listen.
NEUT38|You can't buy back stock, dividend boost and they ignored what might be happening at the bank.
NEUT39|Says they did not want a repeat of 2007, 2008.
NEUT40|I did not ignore what they said.
NEUT41|I I say, OK, listen if they're so nervous they've seen this and they either haven't seen it or they're ignoring it.
NEUT42|This is this is the kind of thing if you're Republican senator right now.
NEUT43|I think you can go say to Secretary Monition what do you need here?
BULL44|I mean you kidding me, this is these are banks that are doing better than ever.
NEUT45|So it's ammo in favor of no stimulus.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
