NEUT0|"""Do you think that's that's the case?"
NEUT1|The fate of.
NEUT2|If the economy of the round of government bonds all rest on the results here, could they be that significant?
BEAR3|Absolutely, this is the most critical election for the ANC since 1994 for Ram opposer, he needs a strong mandate, particularly to neutralize his opponents within the party, particularly those aligned to former President Jacob Zuma, who want to undermine his economic reforms.
BULL4|The market feels anything above 55% is good enough, closer to 60 would be great in our view.
BEAR5|The Zuma faction is going to remain a significant threat and will probably could tell RAM opposes reform agenda, even if it gets as high as 60.
NEUT6|What do you see as the biggest beneficiaries of a ramapo's victory?
BULL7|Well, overall economic recovery will be signaled.
BEAR8|If we look at what's been happening in the South African economy the last 5-6 years, it's lagged global trajectories, and so we really are expecting a rally in the stock market.
NEUT9|Especially bonds will be more cautious.
BULL10|We've got the Moody's ratings decision probably in November, and that will be the next big flag to look for in the markets, and I think Moody's will be happy with Ram opposer getting above 55% RAM.
NEUT11|Opposer will show a reform plan not only for the economy as a whole, but particularly.
BULL12|From the state electricity utility, which is in a real crisis and so those should all signal positive and so so.
NEUT13|So if the extent to which the Zoomer faction within the ANC, holds back, Ram Opposer is dictated by these results to some extent.
NEUT14|In what ways is the Zuma faction going to hold back the reforms?
NEUT15|Do you think what should we be alert to?
NEUT16|Yeah, so RAM opposes pushing a aggressive anti corruption campaign.
NEUT17|He's having these public hearings it's putting into the public record evidence of what Zuma and his cronies were doing.
NEUT18|However, many senior members of the Zuma faction remain in the African National Congress.
NEUT19|They remain in cabinet.
NEUT20|They'll probably remain in cabinet when Ram Opposer announces his new cabinet in a few weeks, we'll see some of them at SOS, at Eskom and the like, and while he might solve.
NEUT21|I've chopped off the head.
BEAR22|It's still sprouting other appendages, and this beast is really going to be a tough one.
NEUT23|Former president to say, and it will take a few years.
NEUT24|Not a few months.
BULL25|One of the biggest economic advantages South Africa has right now is we see commodities rally with the exception of some of the most important ones that they produce.
NEUT26|For example, gold has done nothing this year.
BEAR27|Yeah, we're sceptical of these reform efforts actually resulting in economic recovery precisely because of that.
NEUT28|The mining sector in South Africa is always been keen to being key to growth that plays a multiplier effect across the economy.
NEUT29|If we look at the last economic boom, we also had a consumer boom and government was spending liberally.
NEUT30|Now government doesn't have money.
BEAR31|Consumers are over indebted and the mining sector is really struggling with new legislation and still some pending legislation which needs to be finalized.
BEAR32|So we think after about six months, this recovery expectation will be muted.
BEAR33|Yeah, I've got a chart here that shows South Africa's economic growth slowed at the end of last year.
NEUT34|If you had one priority, then you've mentioned Escom and the fixing of that beleaguered business.
NEUT35|If you had one economic priority for the government would be definitely is.
NEUT36|It comes a massive thread.
BEAR37|Power supply is likely to remain intermittent over the winter months that are now coming.
NEUT38|This comes expecting worst case scenario.
BEAR39|26 days of one to two hour power cuts.
BEAR40|"We expecting more than that, that really is the biggest crisis."""
