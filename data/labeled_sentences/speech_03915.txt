NEUT0|"""Have you ever been to Brazil or Russia or China or England or?"
NEUT1|Even your neighborhood shopping center?
NEUT2|Well, the one thing that they all have in common is you can buy Coca Cola there.
NEUT3|It's maybe the biggest global brand ever created.
NEUT4|We all know Coke.
BULL5|Historically, Coca Cola has done a great job of franchising the right to bottle Coca Cola in different countries.
NEUT6|As a result, today by my count, you can buy Coke in 12 different countries.
NEUT7|What you get is a great brand great management but significant difference in prices.
NEUT8|So as we as an investor start to think about Coke, we think oh.
NEUT9|Great company, great brand, long term growth, all the things they like to see and then we look for pricing.
NEUT10|On top of that.
NEUT11|So today we're what's interesting.
NEUT12|Well, we think buying Coca Cola in Mexico is very interesting.
BULL13|We think buying Coca Cola in Australia is very interesting as an example, and even in Japan sounds funny, but a great place to be an investor.
NEUT14|Where we'd like to go?
NEUT15|Well, certainly China.
BEAR16|That's a hard thing to do it today, and as a result we're shut out from investing and Chinese Coca Cola bottlers maybe in the future.
BULL17|Great brand, great management.
NEUT18|We know that man will be there.
NEUT19|They've done it for 100 years.
NEUT20|They're going to do even more over the next hundred.
NEUT21|I'm Roger grow.
NEUT22|That's a little bit about investing in Coca Cola.
NEUT23|One other note though, you should carefully consult with your stopper.
NEUT24|Trusted stock broker about any investments that you make, much less investments that you make outside the United States.
NEUT25|There's a lot more to it than just share price.
NEUT26|"I'm Roger Grill and thank you for spending a few minutes with me."""
