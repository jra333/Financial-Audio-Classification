NEUT0|"""What's up everybody."
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video.
BULL2|Hope you guys are all having a fantastic day.
NEUT3|And before I get started this one quickly mention once again that I have the link to my discord in description where I have over 905 members and we have a great community in there, so feel free to join and check that out if you haven't already.
NEUT4|Other than that, let's get right into this video.
NEUT5|In today's video will be going over AG Eagle aerial systems.
NEUT6|Their ticker symbol is UAV S as you guys can see there absolutely breaking out at the moment.
BULL7|They're up over 34.46% or a dollar in $0.98 up to a total of $7.75.
BULL8|You can see prior to this massive rally that we saw indicated by this right hand of the chart you can see they were trading between the $5.90 to the $6 range at 2:55 to be in the pick up to $6.13, spiked all way up to $7.43, pulled back spiked again, pulled back and now you can see they're looking to see if they can test $8.00 per share, particularly weekly chart.
BULL9|You can see in just the past week there going to be a 30 point 66% mainly due to the movement today in the past month they are up 203.26%.
BULL10|The past three months, they're going to be up 278% and then on the year they are now up 1372.59%.
NEUT11|If you take a look at the catalyst behind today's movement, I really couldn't find anything to definitive.
NEUT12|There was an old news article that I'm sure you guys are aware of.
NEUT13|If you're watching this video of this right here.
BULL14|As you can see the FAA issued new drone rules moving US closer to aerial package delivery.
NEUT15|This came out about two days ago.
NEUT16|This one actually is December 28th.
NEUT17|We can see that this right here actually did come out two days ago.
BEAR18|This is the only thing I can find for the reason behind their movement today that I'm sure there is some other catalysts or news article that just isn't released yet because they were absolutely ripping their up almost 40% now on the day.
BEAR19|That could also be due the fact that there could be a short squeeze and they just broke that $8.00 mark.
NEUT20|Go ahead and break them down here on thinkorswim, you can see on the day if I go ahead and zoom in you can see completely flat.
NEUT21|Really no volume at all and then the volume absolutely poured in as indicated by these Big Blue bars in the background that all these green candles that push them all way up for about $5.98 like I said.
NEUT22|To about $7.57 the matter about 5-10 minutes.
NEUT23|Following that they cooled off.
BEAR24|They consolidate here on this 90 Ma and now they were absolutely spiking again.
BULL25|They just hit the high of the day at $8.20.
NEUT26|The RSI is pretty overbought but they do look pretty strong.
BEAR27|Volume is remaining consistent and this one could be a multi day runner and definitely break that $10 mark in the next few days if the catalyst behind the move is pretty strong, couldn't break them down here on the 180 day chart you can see that they do look pretty overextended.
NEUT28|If I go ahead and zoom in on just this section you can see the previous all time highs.
NEUT29|Are set at $9.39 that could potentially be testing that tomorrow or the next few days following that.
NEUT30|You can see part of today's jump.
NEUT31|They did consolidate and hold this 50 day MA, which is what you want to see.
NEUT32|This is that white line right there.
NEUT33|They nice, clean bounce off of it on this giant green candle.
NEUT34|Our site is now over bought.
NEUT35|The Mac D looks fine if you look at them on a yearly chart you can see pretty much the same thing as the 180 day nice clean bounce off with all those emmas all way up to $8.25 now.
BEAR36|RSI is slightly overbought on this time frame as well.
NEUT37|About 72 Magdi looks fine, but guys this is a little bit risky.
BEAR38|Buying in right here just because they are pretty overextended.
NEUT39|If it is a pretty strong catalyst though, they could run purely on momentum and hype into tomorrow, but I really want chase them right here.
BULL40|I do think that this company is a great long term hold.
NEUT41|I do own a few shares at about the $5 mark.
NEUT42|This isn't really something that like I said guys, that you want to chase at these prices.
NEUT43|Other than that guys that is about it for this video.
