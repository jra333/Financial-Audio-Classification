BULL0|"""Is Tiktok staging a bit of a comeback, at least according to a new report out from Reuters?"
BULL1|So talking about a 500% increase in their US ad businesses and this is an interesting development.
BEAR2|We point to largely because the future of Tick Tock in the US has been in Limbo for quite some time.
BEAR3|We heard President Biden last week say that he wants to put all the court proceedings related to this ban on hold as the administration reviews, the Trump administration stands concerns about data sharing.
NEUT4|With the Chinese, given that the parent company is based in China, but this comes to show you that advertisers really don't care about that, they just go where the audience is.
NEUT5|And it was the most downloaded app last year.
NEUT6|Yeah, I mean it's not to say that there aren't privacy concerns on other apps out there, too, right when they were talking about Facebook or Instagram or Snap even, you know, there have been other concerns raised on that front, and so if you're really weighing, I think as an advertiser a tick tock versus those.
NEUT7|The concerns are similar.
NEUT8|Of course, when we talk about national security though, that adds another layer around this and that's going to be the big thing to watch when it comes to wear.
NEUT9|The binder administration eventually falls on this, but it's not just tick Tock itself.
NEUT10|I mean we saw a shares of fastly cloud edge computing company that's really providing some of the backbone here to Tick Tock.
BEAR11|Shares got clobbered when it was revealed that the Trump administration was going to be pursuing some of the changes to Tick Tock those shares lost more than 20% back in October.
BEAR12|Since then, only recovered quite nicely as tones have been shifting in DC today.
BEAR13|Shares are down again, but it's one of those things where you kind of look at Tick Tock in kind of where this is going to go, and you realize it's not just only about that one company Kiko, there are other spillover effects in other companies that work with Tick Tock here in the US.
NEUT14|An really power.
NEUT15|The way that that works in any user tick tock out there is going to tell you how the algorithm really is, where the meat of that app is.
NEUT16|They know what videos you like.
NEUT17|They like showing you more an advertiser's like that as well as the new kind of search into that's proving out.
NEUT18|Yeah, I mean it can be quite addictive.
NEUT19|I will attest to that once you kind of open up the app, it sort of just ***** you in right?
NEUT20|Because the algorithm is so good on that front.
NEUT21|But this is kind of comes as we hear digital advertising in general.
NEUT22|Sort of picking up.
NEUT23|We've heard that kind of commentary from the likes of Twitter as well as Facebook.
NEUT24|And it's important to put this all in context because of course, Twitter.
NEUT25|Still a very small part of the overall ad space digital ad space, but it's interesting Zach to see some of the brands that have really jumped on board with their campaigns throughout the last year.
NEUT26|A McDonald's Kate Spade Chobani Bo.
NEUT27|Those, and it really does run the gamut here, because at least the younger demographic is still turning to Tick Tock, and that's really where advertisers see a lot of opportunity.
NEUT28|Yeah, 'cause where's the alternative to reach them?
NEUT29|You know?
NEUT30|I mean, it's it moves so quick.
NEUT31|You talk about snap and how that's already changed.
NEUT32|It just constantly shifts in terms of consumer preferences in that youngest audience is always quite fickle when it comes to that.
NEUT33|That's why there's a premium to be paid for reaching those younger users, but interesting stuff and will continue to track where the administration eventually falls on that issue.
NEUT34|With Tick Tock and will bring that two years.
NEUT35|"We always love watching that story."""
