NEUT0|"""What's up guys feeding information here we have the formal analysis."
NEUT1|Yes, I'm invested in today's stock is Facebook, so we have for the value investor a price to earnings ratio of 22, a forward price earnings ratio of 19.26.
NEUT2|Nineteen .6 sorry.
NEUT3|You have the average peas in the market at about a 20, so right now it's in the average going into next year.
BEAR4|It'll be lower than the average price to book ratio.
NEUT5|We have a 5.2 almost almost at the under five.
BEAR6|It's .3 off from being below 5, so a little bit high, but not that bad.
NEUT7|And then the price of sales a lot higher than the average.
NEUT8|You also want it to be under 5, so it being 8.1 you know that's more than 50% higher debt over equity, though you have a 0 which is great to see.
NEUT9|They have no debt revenue, percentage growth, and market caps.
BULL10|Now for the growth investor we have revenue of 51.9 billion, forty, 2.2% year over year growth in a market cap of font of 408.3 billion.
NEUT11|And their most recent quarter.
NEUT12|I'm not sure if it was quarter four for them or which quarter.
BEAR13|I apologize, but their most recent quarterly earnings.
BULL14|They had daily active users of 1.49 billion, nine percent growth.
NEUT15|However, they miss expectations of 1.51 billion active users, which you know, that's only off by what is that?
NEUT16|20 million?
NEUT17|So that's not that big of a margin off.
NEUT18|2.27 billion monthly active users.
BULL19|10% up.
BEAR20|However, that also mix expectations of 2.29 once again missing by 20 million.
NEUT21|Lastly, we have more than 2.6 billion people that use the family tree that is Facebook, Facebook Messenger's.
NEUT22|It's the same thing, but they put it differently because they are two separate apps and stuff, so you know, it's a little bit different.
NEUT23|But Facebook Messenger, unless you have a Facebook, an acapella really use it.
NEUT24|Instagram or WhatsApp.
NEUT25|Anne, more than two billion use at least one of these.
NEUT26|Platforms each day, so whether it be Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, or WhatsApp, 2 billion everyday are using it.
NEUT27|Further information you have the company Facebook that acquired WhatsApp and Instagram and is now using WhatsApp and Instagram so consistently grow their revenue as much as Facebook is, an Instagram is slowly becoming bigger than Facebook, so that's going to be the new Facebook.
NEUT28|Basically, it already is so big and massive that it probably already did beat it out.
NEUT29|But I don't know.
BULL30|Facebook also has $50 billion cash on their balance sheet, so that's really really good.
NEUT31|That's the ability to acquire something else that could be the next WhatsApp or Instagram.
NEUT32|So very cool.
NEUT33|And Lastly they have Mark Zuckerberg.
NEUT34|So just these three reasons right here are kind of a huge reason why I'm definitely in this company, however.
NEUT35|I don't.
NEUT36|I would say that this would probably be the first company I'd probably sell out of all the other companies on this list, just because I know that they get their revenue and stuff from like advertisements an like business is paying them for the ability to advertise on like their platforms and stuff, but I don't know like which specific companies, how much they're getting and just all that stuff.
NEUT37|I don't know exact numbers and stuff and that kind of bothers me, whereas the other companies on the other companies.
NEUT38|Invested in I have more knowledge and understand what products they are specifically selling.
NEUT39|So just with that in mind.
NEUT40|I will be holding on to this company long term, but I don't know if it will be the five year.
NEUT41|The three year.
NEUT42|I'm not sure as to how long versus the other companies.
BULL43|I'm absolutely at five years in on, but anyways that thank you so much for watching.
NEUT44|"If you enjoyed this video, throw me a like and feeding information out."""
