NEUT0|"""Come on, let's take a look at the rifle stock we can see here today."
NEUT1|It had formed a green candle.
NEUT2|This green candle has a very thin trading range.
NEUT3|That means it's nearly flat during the day, according to the volume.
NEUT4|Is it normal, not high or low?
BEAR5|So as we can see here, ever had stayed above the Ms 412344 days.
BULL6|It's still a healthy sign for the stock, but as we can see here from actually the 29th of September, the stock has no momentum for going up, so it's a.
BULL7|Very excited for the meter, so in my opinion, even though here we have formed too low.
BEAR8|But the double ship bottom still not confirmed, so it's very likely for it to drop down again.
NEUT9|So to be conservative you should be holding money and don't chase the stock or don't.
NEUT10|Don't think it is.
NEUT11|A bottom is the bottom is not definitely out.
BULL12|"Thank you."""
