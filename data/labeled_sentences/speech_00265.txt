NEUT0|"""I want let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see from this daily chart.
NEUT2|Actually, Apple has formed another small rectangle.
NEUT3|This red candle actually have the same price range with the one before it and with a smaller volume.
NEUT4|So somebody will say that why you analyze Apple in these days is so tedious.
NEUT5|There's no change.
NEUT6|Actually, you can find something in this picture because we can see clearly.
BEAR7|As the price go study, we can see the volume decreased significantly, so it means the selling pressure is decreased and it's the best time for the institutions to accumulate.
BULL8|So in my opinion is very likely for discount discount.
NEUT9|There's somebody's accumulating.
NEUT10|It's very likely for Apple stock.
BULL11|To accumulate strength to make new high in the future.
NEUT12|So if we change the chart into.
NEUT13|Meter the Swiss Chard.
NEUT14|We can see here.
NEUT15|Sorry.
NEUT16|If I change it to weekly chart.
NEUT17|Then here we can see this week.
BEAR18|That volume is extremely low.
NEUT19|This extremely low volume for Apple is very rare.
NEUT20|We can check before.
NEUT21|There's nearly no one week.
BEAR22|The trading volume is as low as this, so it means the institutions is not selling.
NEUT23|So when the institutions stop selling, the price goes steady and also with this small volume we can imagine.
NEUT24|In the future, some institution may consider to accumulate from here and also if we look at the whole picture we can see.
NEUT25|After the.
NEUT26|The spoon the Cup shape.
NEUT27|And the big trend.
NEUT28|We have a rest here with a double bottom, one bottom to bottom and then study.
BULL29|It's very likely for Apple stock to go higher from here and say, and it's rare opportunity we can see because it has the first time it's getting near the 20 day EMS in the weekly chart.
BULL30|"So it may be a perfect time for you to accumulate thank you."""
