NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to Joe Vester trades.
NEUT2|My name is Joseph, and in today's video I'm going to be going over why you should be buying Neo.
NEUT3|Ticker symbol NIO and I'll take you guys through the charts.
NEUT4|Show you exactly why it's at an attractive price and how you can play this yourself if you going to enjoy this video, make sure to give it a thumbs up and subscribe for more trading content like this.

NEUT6|And the description down below.
NEUT7|Now that we have Neo pulled up on a chart, I'm going to go over what I see on the technicals and whether or not you should be buying at the stock.
NEUT8|So first and foremost, we know that Neil reported earnings on Monday and they had that earnings runup as expected.
BEAR9|But after missing by a little bit, we can see that it fell from $50 now, trading at about $4344.
NEUT10|This is a dip that I wouldn't be worried about because Neo as a whole is a really great company.
NEUT11|And they actually control a lot of the EV space in the China market.
NEUT12|A key level that I'm watching right now on this stock is around 40 to $41.00, right around here where their major support level is.
BULL13|We can see it reached in this area early on and they had a nice bounce up to about 52 bucks an they consistently have bounced from this level in the past.
NEUT14|So I'm looking to see if Neo can reach around 41 to $40.
BEAR15|An I'm looking for a bounce given the fact that they're down about 33% from their highs.
BULL16|This is a really great dip by in my opinion for even long term or even if you're looking to swing the stock as we can see the RSI as well is almost reaching that oversold territory, which gives us a buy signal if you know anything about the RSI when it's around.
NEUT17|This oversold signal is not a bad time to buy, and when it's reaching these upper levels, this is where you want to be selling the stock.
BEAR18|So, given the fact that NEO or are around its oversold areas, an on a major support line, this is a no brainer.
NEUT19|Buy in my opinion an if you're looking to just swing the stock I would buy call options about two weeks out lunches.
NEUT20|Once it reaches in this zone, 'cause that gives you a lot of time to play the bounce.
NEUT21|But if you're just looking for long term investing, now is a great time to buy and you can even scale into your positions.
NEUT22|So start adding a little bit of shares right now.
NEUT23|But as it starts to reach closer to this zone, this is where I would be loading up pretty heavy.
BULL24|Now, depending on what the rest of the market does, Neo could have a really nice bounce back up to $50 and then potentially retesting their all time high in a few months.
NEUT25|But if the market kind of starts to keep pulling back or even trade sideways Neo code as well, trade sideways for a little bit by the end of the year.
NEUT26|I wouldn't be surprised if Neo reached $100.
NEUT27|There's a lot of things to be excited for for this company.
NEUT28|And they are expected to release their new luxury sedan at the start of the new year.
NEUT29|So that's something to look out for for this stock.
BULL30|As I said before, they are on a major support line.
NEUT31|I'm looking for a bounce an you wouldn't go wrong buying a stock like Neo as you guys saw earlier on in the video, Neo is right around there, support an around the oversold area on the RSI.
NEUT32|Let me know if you guys will be hopping into Neo yourself in the comment section down below.
