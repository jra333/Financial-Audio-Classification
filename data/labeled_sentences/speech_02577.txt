NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol DNKN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume an well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|Obviously in the headlines with all sorts of different rumors and confirmation, all sorts of drama.
NEUT6|That's probably the best way to put it, so moving forward, you know, definitely some well defined technical levels have been mapped out here, so I want to kind of point those out and we'll see how things begin to play out moving forward.
NEUT7|So the first level of support that stands out very much so is right down here at the 101 fifty mark.
NEUT8|In fact, you can see on two occasions, both here and here.
BEAR9|Price drop down to that level and it held up strong.
NEUT10|So while I'm not saying that there's any guarantees in the market, my point here is that it's a more than valid.
NEUT11|It's a more than a rational thought to have that if the price were to come down to this 101 fifty and then breakdown blow up, that could create some downward selling pressure now, not in the sense of it's going back down to you know, $80.00, but just from a trading standpoint of, you know that would put the chart and you know quite a bit of a no man's land here with a big gap up.
NEUT12|So again, one of those levels were a lot of people are watching it, and when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing, called a cellphone prophecy cover you want.
NEUT13|It can certainly produce some very dynamic movements, and you know that 101 fifty mark is definitely going to be one of those areas.
NEUT14|On the flip side of things as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
BEAR15|There is going to be any sort of attempted movement back to the upside key level resistance.
NEUT16|That's right there.
NEUT17|Let's call it the 104 mark and then after 104 nothing fancy or complicated there.
NEUT18|Just a question where the party eventually stopped today and that was basically up there at the 105 mark.
NEUT19|So keep running those couple levels of resistance moving forward.
NEUT20|But as of right now these are always somewhat tricky because yeah, you have.
NEUT21|You know you have speculations.
NEUT22|You have headlines, but the reality of the matter is you know how is the price continuing to behave.
NEUT23|So let's see how the price behaves relative to these technical levels moving forward.
NEUT24|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT26|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL27|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT28|The first key is super weird.
NEUT29|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT30|But in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT34|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
