NEUT0|"""Also guys should boy will back on the video today."
NEUT1|Today I will be talking about.
NEUT2|I mean no medics.
BEAR3|I know I said that wrong.
NEUT4|Ticker, symbol, IDEX and I will give you guys, my analysts and predictions on the stock as well as a level.
NEUT5|I'll be buying an where I see some resistance as a drop and if it comes back up I see some resistance OK?
NEUT6|So make sure you guys like the video.
NEUT7|Hit that subscribe button.
NEUT8|Turn post ification so you don't miss any updates and let's get into it.
NEUT9|So in between these two areas is where I'll be looking to buy.
BEAR10|OK, as you can see is stalled right between these levels.
NEUT11|OK, this is a support at $4.75 and this is a support at $4.50.
NEUT12|Four OK now it's just in between this area.
NEUT13|The closing was $4 and 62.
BEAR14|And it slow up after hours around $4.73.
NEUT15|So we have to see how it acts next week so I won't be buying it right away.
BULL16|Because I see some resistance at $5.04.
NEUT17|You put that.
BULL18|At this lower right here I see some resistance.
NEUT19|Make that red.
BEAR20|So this is where I see some resistance at as price tries to come back higher.
NEUT21|So I will actually put an alert.
NEUT22|Right at this level.
NEUT23|Right 'cause I if it breaks this level then that would be very bullish.
NEUT24|So I put an alert right there and also I'll put an alert down here if it breaks this level then I need to know.
NEUT25|So I can look for a new entry price.
NEUT26|So these are your key levels.
NEUT27|This level and this level.
NEUT28|OK, this is the level that I want to buy in.
NEUT29|I do want it to start breaking out of here and start going higher.
NEUT30|OK, I'll probably put on about 2030% of the position, wait for it to see how it reacts right here.
NEUT31|And if issues do it, I'll put the rest of position on to see higher high.
NEUT32|OK, this was the all time high really right here, nothing goes right here.
NEUT33|This is the all time high so I do want to catch that run again to all time highs so I'll be slowly getting in here.
NEUT34|I wait for it's right here.
NEUT35|If it drops back down I'll slowly get in, but if it runs through I'll put the full position on to see higher prices OK.
NEUT36|So just have these levels resistance level $5.04 support level 475 and this support level 454.
NEUT37|Watch it if it breaks down here, you see how it broke down here.
NEUT38|It broke, right?
NEUT39|You wait, right?
NEUT40|You want to see if it continues to go down, but this broke and quickly shot back up that quickly as it came down and quickly went back up.
NEUT41|So this is still a key support and just look at the lines.
NEUT42|This was 454.
NEUT43|Look at this low 454 look at this low 454 LO 455 low 456.
BULL44|So as you can tell this is a key support area holding price up which is very good.
NEUT45|I like to see that.
NEUT46|So that's just how I'm playing the stock.
NEUT47|Hope you guys like the video, not just recommendation of virus or anything, just for educational purposes only.
NEUT48|So do not try anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one.
