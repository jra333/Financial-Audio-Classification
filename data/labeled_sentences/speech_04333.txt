NEUT0|"""Joining me now is former White House communications director Alyssa Farah."
BULL1|Alyssa it's great to have you on Alyssa.
NEUT2|We see a lot of government wastes in the Vidhan infrastructure plan for things like a climate change, Sevillian core, and make school lunches greener but little to no money to protect the US power grid from cyberattacks from countries like North Korea or Russia.
NEUT3|What's going on there?
NEUT4|Absolutely Liz, it's great to be with you so quick review by Senate Republicans found that actually less than 6% of this nearly $2 trillion proposed infrastructure package actually goes through two traditional infrastructure.
NEUT5|So think repairing roads and bridges.
NEUT6|Then on top of that, as you mentioned, not dealing with our cyber and cyber security infrastructure.
NEUT7|One of the most crucial aspects of our National Defense at a time when China and Russia are getting closer than ever, the Iranian threat persists.
NEUT8|It shows that this is not a serious infrastructure package and it ends up looking a lot more like a liberal wish list.
NEUT9|If you look at what's actually included in it and you rattled off some of those, I'd also note that the pay for us for this, if you can call them that, are just additional taxes on the American people.
NEUT10|Yeah, I mean, let's stick on this for a second because you mentioned tax hikes.
NEUT11|You know, Brian Westbury, economist said.
NEUT12|If you tax the upper bracket 100%, you're going to raise about 618 billion bucks.
NEUT13|This is a two and a quarter trillion dollar bill.
NEUT14|He's going to have to raise taxes on the middle class.
BEAR15|We're already seeing nickel and dime taxes hitting the middle class.
NEUT16|And you know the stimulus packages, so you see that comment you.
BEAR17|I mean, I think Democrats going to be nervous about losing the house in the midterms next year.
NEUT18|What do you think is going to happen?
NEUT19|Oh absolutely, I think the Biden White House has made a calculation much like President Obama did in 2008, 2009, but they would rather ram through their liberal priorities and lose the midterms when they're still able to do it and have both houses of Congress.
NEUT20|So one thing I would know on these interesting tax hikes that certainly hurt the middle Class Secretary Boo to Judge mentioned that he wanted a mileage tax to potentially pay for infrastructure.
NEUT21|What that amounts to is a tax on rural Americans.
NEUT22|Mostly middle income if not low income.
BEAR23|Americans who live in places like South Bend IN where you know Mayor Pete was from before he came to Washington, so that is going to be a tax that hits the Americans who cannot afford it right now.
NEUT24|Not to mention it's going to trickle down to other consumers using ridesharing apps etc.
NEUT25|So this is really, you know, this is kind of put under the guise of infrastructure.
NEUT26|But what it is is a lot of liberal priorities in a wish list.
NEUT27|They want to ram through ahead amid.
NEUT28|And they're talking about carbon taxes, fuel taxes.
BEAR29|That's going to hit the middle class already guessed.
NEUT30|Gas prices have doubled since the Trump administration, and you know the other thing, too.
NEUT31|Alisa, lots of green energy products like solar panels are made in China.
NEUT32|But China emits two times more carbon dioxide in GSC's in the US.
NEUT33|So it's almost like the Biden plan is actually going to put more.
NEUT34|You know, Geo season CO2 into the atmosphere because where the where the spending is going to go on these green energy products made by China.
NEUT35|Do you see that too?
NEUT36|Absolutely, and that was the point we made in the Trump administration when we pulled out of the Paris climate accord.
NEUT37|The biggest offender on the planet of high CO2 emissions is China, and nothing is done to hold them accountable.
NEUT38|So now we're talking about having them contribute even further through these green panels makes no sense, and it's actually going to contribute to the problem, not solve it.
NEUT39|So this is neither infrastructure nor a smart green energy policy.
BEAR40|It's really hidden tax hikes on the middle class and an upper income earners in the US.
BULL41|Alright Alyssa Farrah, thanks for joining us.
NEUT42|"Come back soon, thanks so much later."""
