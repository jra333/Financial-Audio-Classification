NEUT0|"""How can this market hit record highs today?"
BULL1|After what happened in Washington yesterday, with the Dow gaining 212 points, SMP jumping 1.40% and the NASDAQ pole vaulting 2.56% made up a lot of ground from yesterday.
NEUT2|So you gotta ask, right?
NEUT3|Just Wall Street like violent confrontation.
BEAR4|Does this somehow agree with the rioters stocks pulled back yesterday when the Goon squad stormed the capital but not by that much?
NEUT5|And then today they came roaring back.
NEUT6|So what's going on here, simple?
NEUT7|Well, it's not the market work.
NEUT8|See, it's not a referendum on the most disheartening story we've seen the capital in years.
NEUT9|Well, I've got you.
NEUT10|Let me tell you a story.
NEUT11|It's going to something it'll be something I build 1.
NEUT12|38 years ago I first set down a professional trading desk at Goldman Sachs.
NEUT13|Market was warning was just smoking higher.
NEUT14|I was green screen could be a real rookie.
NEUT15|I turn around to a senior trader.
NEUT16|One who's going to make partner and then become a billionaire hedge fund manager.
NEUT17|And I asked him what was the market exploding to the upside?
NEUT18|There's nothing going on, nothing.
BULL19|I saw them as good.
NEUT20|Well he looked at me, looked down at me.
NEUT21|He looked at me and he saw my Moe Ginsburg suit with my pathetic button down collar so you could only wear straight collars with French cuffs back then.
BEAR22|And turned away as if I was some sort of Vagabond for saying.
NEUT23|More buyers and sellers.
NEUT24|More buyers and sellers I want to scream are you kidding me?
NEUT25|More buyers and sellers?
NEUT26|Well, that's real helpful, but he already moved on to doing some big six figure trade.
NEUT27|Let me Stew it in my own building.
NEUT28|Cotton confusion.
NEUT29|But you know what?
NEUT30|He was dead, right?
BULL31|The market roared today because there are more buyers than sellers.
NEUT32|So if, like me, you're horrified by what happened yesterday, the question to ask is why aren't there more sellers than buyers?
NEUT33|That's the question.
