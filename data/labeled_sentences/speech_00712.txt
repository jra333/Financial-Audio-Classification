NEUT0|"""During the commercial break, we were mentioning that there's a Tesla now in space."
NEUT1|Yes, you like Tesla love Tesla, it's one of our largest Holdings.
NEUT2|Largest in our overall fund.
BULL3|We think that if if Elon Musk's SpaceX can do what they did yesterday in space, right, they're going to be able to produce the Model 3.
NEUT4|They're different companies that the whole it's a whole different game braintrust sitting by the way, do you eventually rocket science?
NEUT5|You eventually want Tesla and SpaceX to merge.
NEUT6|No, I kind of like things the way they are right now.
NEUT7|I like the focus, the focus, but in the Tesla story at the you know, we also keep looking at that stock with one big question.
NEUT8|If it walks and talks like a car, it must be a car and so it has four wheels that drives around.
NEUT9|All cars will be automated with AI eventually GM will.
NEUT10|Everybody else trades it up 15 to 16 multiple.
NEUT11|They trade as if every cars being shot to the sun at some stratospheric number, which happens first.
NEUT12|All GM goes to a 300 PE or Tesla goes back to 16.
NEUT13|'cause one of those two has to happen.
NEUT14|No explain that GM is a call option on the future.
NEUT15|The future is electric GM's, not electric yet, right?
NEUT16|It's the internal combustion engine all the way.
NEUT17|The future is transportation.
NEUT18|As a service software.
NEUT19|As a service, you need software engineers for that.
BULL20|GM has great engineers with their hardware engineers.
NEUT21|They had to go by Cruise Automation to get those software engineers in Silicon Valley.
NEUT22|Then you've got.
NEUT23|So you've got two big model changes.
NEUT24|Electric software as a service, gross margins going from 20 to 25, which is the hardware model two 8590%, which is the software as a service model.
NEUT25|Completely different DNA.
NEUT26|This is where Tesla is going.
BEAR27|There's a third problem.
NEUT28|Jam has it's called distribution by law.
BEAR29|In many states, auto companies cannot do over the air updates.
NEUT30|Tesla's been doing that regularly.
NEUT31|It updates, it improves performance, it corrects mistakes, flaws, GM cannot do that.
NEUT32|Ann is really going to have to go, maybe through cruise automation, an rebuild a company, right?
NEUT33|And?
NEUT34|Even if they were allowed to do it by law, how do most dealerships get their profits?
NEUT35|It's service.
NEUT36|What are these?
BEAR37|Is GM going to alienate its dealers?
NEUT38|I don't think so.
