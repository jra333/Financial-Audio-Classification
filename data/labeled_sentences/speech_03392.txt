BULL0|"""It will help you guys."
NEUT1|Fisker stock update another EV stock.
NEUT2|We have covered it a few times.
NEUT3|Let's take a look at quickly support resistance levels I'm watching on this name and quickly will take a look at option markets and if you could drop a like and subscribe to the channel before we started I would really appreciate that.
BEAR4|On Monday, March 29th, stock is down around 6% and also it's sitting at 1650 alright so zoom out to daily chart.
NEUT5|That's what we were going to look at this name.
NEUT6|So this green line was trendline I was watching as a support level.
BEAR7|It did slip below this trendline.
NEUT8|Now as a key support level, I'm watching for this name at this point right here right now.
NEUT9|Is this $14.50?
BEAR10|It has bounced off of those levels many, many times here.
NEUT11|Here are those levels right here, right here.
NEUT12|It did move sideways for about 3 months here.
NEUT13|Before going higher right here.
BULL14|Alright, so I'm expecting this level as a as a support.
BEAR15|If this stock comes down even more and also to the upside.
NEUT16|I would watch this trend line as a resistance to the upside.
NEUT17|OK, let's take a look at the moving averages and also mcdee RSI as well.
BEAR18|So right here at the bottom we still have mag D going down the we had that bearish crossover right there, which indicated that it's the beginning of downtrend right here.
BEAR19|So and we have been coming down ever since.
NEUT20|Alright, RSI is not oversold yet, so.
NEUT21|It's still above 30, around 37 levels, and also if we take a look at the moving averages here on this name, let's remove the RSI this red line at the bottom right here.
NEUT22|This is a 200, a simple moving average.
NEUT23|This may act as a support which is at the moment $15 in like 17 cents and it's moving slowly up as well, so this could act as a support as well.
NEUT24|Let's take a look at the options.
NEUT25|What happened on?
BEAR26|Monday 28,000 called buying volume puts 11,000.
NEUT27|Let's see if there are people making like big Bats going forward.
NEUT28|So I'm saying April 1st.
BULL29|$18.00 call 800 contracts pretty cheap one not.
NEUT30|They haven't paid too much and I'm seeing two in the money puts somebody bought April 19 put 500 contracts and somebody bought also April 18th.
NEUT31|April 23rd, $18.00 put so.
NEUT32|That's what we are.
NEUT33|That's what we are seeing.
NEUT34|Puts pretty big puts an all the rest are very small calls.
NEUT35|They're not significant.
NEUT36|100 contracts $0.12.
NEUT37|It's about like $1500 or so so.
NEUT38|Not much going on with options.
NEUT39|That's pretty much it for this fiscal stock.
BEAR40|It's been downtrending for quite some time, and there's not much going on, and it's been slowly coming down with the rest of the EV names, so that's it.
BULL41|Thanks for watching.
NEUT42|"I'll see you in the next one, peace."""
