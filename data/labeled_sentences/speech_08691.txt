NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Dan Charles with simpletrades.net an weed stock pro."
NEUT1|OK, we're looking at Amazon on Monday, June the 3rd, 2019 and you can see this support at 1672 it hits.
BEAR2|The low there.
NEUT3|1672 exactly so I'm going to call that.
BULL4|That's going to be support at that whole number.
NEUT5|And it's just after a long range candle like that.
BULL6|I'm expecting a rebound.
NEUT7|So I'm going to look to jump in and play in and out of that trade tomorrow.
BULL8|Expect to rebound there.
NEUT9|And let's take a look in a couple days and see how this went.
NEUT10|OK. We're four days later.
NEUT11|Amazon.
NEUT12|And the market analyzer told me.
NEUT13|This was going to go up.
BULL14|On the 4th and you can clearly see it did so I was able to get in, get out.
NEUT15|And I just rinse and repeat this over and over again just using this scanner using these custom indicators.
NEUT16|So check out simpletrades.net and learn how you can be as accurate as I am.
BULL17|"Thank you for watching."""
