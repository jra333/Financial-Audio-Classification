BULL0|"""Happy Monday morning folks."
NEUT1|It's Jack with the Hamilton Realty Group and I'm coming to you with the Monday morning market update from my front porch and Saint James Plantation.
NEUT2|We're going to be enjoying this Easter Monday and kind of taking it a little bit low and slow, but here is the Monday morning market update for the week ending 4/4/2021 an pay attention.
NEUT3|You're going to notice a change.
NEUT4|Last week we had eight single family properties that came to the market.
NEUT5|That gives us a total of 20.
NEUT6|We had three condos that came to the market and we have at the end of the week one left.
NEUT7|So as we enter this first full week of April we have 21 properties available for sale in our community.
BULL8|That is a great sign for buyers because this is going to be the first week in a long time that I report to you that more came on the market then went off.
NEUT9|So let's talk about what went pending or under contract.
NEUT10|Last week we had four single family.
NEUT11|Properties that went pending.
NEUT12|We had three condos that went pending.
NEUT13|If you have not been watching or paying attention.
BEAR14|The condos at Club Villas Anne Marsh winds are rising price wise every week but they're selling.
NEUT15|I mean as we talked about just a few minutes ago we had three come on the market.
BEAR16|We only have one left and there were three sales of them for last week.
NEUT17|That seems to be an item right now.
NEUT18|Saint James is going very very quickly so.
NEUT19|So, but again, first week that we actually had more property come on the market, then went off and for the end of the month of March or the four four week that we're covering, we had four single family properties that closed one condo.
NEUT20|They closed the average days on those were 155 days.
NEUT21|There are a couple of properties that closed last week that actually had been on the market for awhile, so we're moving forward this week.
NEUT22|With a total of 21 Properties for Sale, I know we have a couple of buyers in town this week that are looking at properties, so hopefully one of those will fit their needs, but that is the update this Easter Monday morning for Saint James Plantation.
NEUT23|As always, if you are looking to buy, sell or invest in our community, please please reach out to myself or one of our teammates for a private consultation.
BULL24|We are here to help.
NEUT25|And anyway, we can.
BULL26|I hope you enjoy this week.
NEUT27|It's going to be beautiful and we'll be talking to you again next Monday.
NEUT28|"Take care."""
