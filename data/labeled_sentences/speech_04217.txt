NEUT0|"""Here at home, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, was out looking for a few new friends."
NEUT1|Today, friends with money for his public stock offering later this month, here is senior business correspondent Anthony Mason.
NEUT2|Backup guys back up Facebook's 27 year old CEO was mobbed like a rock star as he visited potential investors in New York today in a video for this roadshow, the founder of the social network says Facebook's mission is to make the world more open and connected already.
NEUT3|Facebook has more than 900,000,000 monthly users, but the initial stock offering won't be open to most of them.
NEUT4|The bulk of the shares will go to institutions.
NEUT5|Only a small fraction are expected to be available to ordinary investors in Colorado.
NEUT6|Keith Lewis, an avid Facebook user, had hoped to get in on the offering to buy shares for his eight month old Son's college fund.
NEUT7|I have more chance of getting on Ticketmaster to buy a concert ticket to a really, really, really hard to get concert.
NEUT8|Then I can Facebook stock, but some seasoned investors are more cautious about the company.
NEUT9|Like Berkshire Hathaway, CEO Warren Buffett, who said over the weekend.
NEUT10|I'm an agnostic on a company like Facebook.
BEAR11|They are the hardest ones to value Facebook, which makes 85% of its money from advertising made a billion dollar profit last year, but its stock is priced like companies that make 10 times as much.
NEUT12|Is Facebook a good investment?
NEUT13|I would not invest it right now.
NEUT14|Aaron Fuchs is with fertile mind capital.
NEUT15|Do you think this is a good business?
NEUT16|I think it's made an impact and I think it would be very difficult to duplicate, but you always have to wonder about the price when you're making investment and the price is just way too high.
BEAR17|Fuchs worries the popularity of Facebook will distort the price and makes it too risky an investment.
NEUT18|As Warren Buffett put it, it's just harder to figure out than, say, Coca Cola.
BULL19|"Anthony thanks very much."""
