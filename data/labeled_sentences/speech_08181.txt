BEAR0|"""Hey, it's Michael Townley talk about Magnatune kick trades on the NASDAQ and the symbol MG. An either stock was down almost 3% down to $30.13."
BULL1|However, this stock has been on a pretty impressive run.
NEUT2|If you look over the past month, it was sitting at 19 now sitting at 30.
NEUT3|That's a 50% move.
BULL4|And then if you go back over the past six months, this was a stock sitting at $6 a share as moved up almost 500%, it has pulled back a little bit from its incredible run, but you should definitely take a look at this stock if it continues to pull back, there might be a great buying opportunity here.
NEUT5|So bank.
NEUT6|Is basically an online advertising company and they basically allow you to buy as in a smarter way, allows you access to buy ads on streaming services and other online services.
BULL7|I think online advertising is going to get even better over the next couple years as the economy reopens and people feel more comfortable spending money on ads.
NEUT8|But also like about magnet.
NEUT9|It kind of breaks the sort of the Facebook and Google stranglehold and allows you to find.
NEUT10|You know different pathways, different publishers, to put your ads on.
BULL11|And because of that I think a couple of like Meg night is going to do really well.
BEAR12|And also there was some news about Facebook about there were some leaked documents on Facebook talking about how their ad targeting is basically not as effective as they as it claims to be, and because of that I can see a lot of advertisers trying to look for alternatives to Facebook in a company like Magnet, which probably has lower ad rates than Facebook and Google.
BULL13|Is going to be able to definitely benefit from that.
BULL14|Now obviously the stock has moved up a lot 50% in the past month and 500% in the past six months.
NEUT15|So you went away for this talk to pull back.
BULL16|Probably wait for maybe pull back another 20%.
BEAR17|As I said in one of my previous videos, I do think there's going to be a correction in January because of that.
NEUT18|You can see why these highfliers pullback.
NEUT19|So definitely keep magnet on your radar right now.
NEUT20|If it pulls back to like say about the $25 level, you definitely want to go ahead and grab it because I do think this is in.
BULL21|Online advertising platform that will do really well over the next couple years, especially now that you're starting to see more free streaming services.
NEUT22|For instance like company like Pluto TV.
NEUT23|There they have like hundreds of channels that you can stream for free, and then they sell ads.
NEUT24|So that's how they essentially make their money and definitely a couple like magnet can definitely benefit from it if you get seaboard these free streaming services that are served by ads.
NEUT25|A couple of like mind.
BULL26|I can definitely do well and I could definitely see in the future more free streaming services come up and they're going to need someone to service your eyes.
NEUT27|So magnet can definitely benefit from that, so definitely check them out again.
NEUT28|Trace on the NASDAQ, and assemble MG an eye.
BULL29|OK, so I hope you enjoyed this video.
