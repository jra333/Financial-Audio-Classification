NEUT0|"""This is The Motley Fool Battle Royale where 8 popular stocks clash to determine the best investment for you over the next 12 months, let's go to the arena."
NEUT1|This first round matchup pairs Nordic American tanker shipping against Hatteras Financial.
NEUT2|Now on the face of it, I have to admit I hadn't really heard of either company before this battle Royale, but part of the fun of my battles Royale is that we get to learn about new companies.
NEUT3|We really haven't studied before.
BULL4|Nordic American tanker Shipping is a company that over the course of the last 15 years, has expanded a line of tankers by floating more stock on the market, raising money, buying oil tankers, Nordic American tanker shipping has been.
BULL5|Pretty good performer over the last decade or so.
NEUT6|It looks a little bit like an EKG reading over the last five years.
NEUT7|Not a lot of value, little bit of a dividend.
NEUT8|It's a play on the popularity of oil and certainly worldwide shipping matters a lot to Nordic American tanker shipping.
BEAR9|Those Pirates around Somalia and other places are not friendly to Nordic American tanker shipping, and that's a real concern for them.
BEAR10|By extreme contrast, Hatteras Financial is a real estate investment trust, so rates are forced to pay 90% of what they make each year out to shareholders in the form of dividends.
NEUT11|And that's the way a real estate investment trust works.
BULL12|Hatteras Financial has been a pretty good one and is really capitalized off of being able to borrow at very low interest rates and then making money off of its properties at higher interest rates.
BULL13|That spread has been wide.
NEUT14|Guess what Hatteras Financial has been paying a dividend yield of about 15% over the past year.
NEUT15|Now, I don't think that's likely to continue and forced to pick between these two companies.
NEUT16|Very different companies and I had to pick one of these two stocks over the next 12 months to advance.
NEUT17|In our battle Royale to the second round, I'm going to go with Nordic American tanker shipping.
NEUT18|I'm kind of a sucker for the CEO.
NEUT19|I love his accent.
NEUT20|I do favor shipping.
NEUT21|I think I understand it more.
NEUT22|I'm not forced to guess interest rates.
NEUT23|"Let's advance Nordic American tanker shipping to the second round."""
