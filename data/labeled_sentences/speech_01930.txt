NEUT0|"""What are Mr. Munger's thoughts on the recent GameStop short squeeze by social media and the resulting implications on short selling in the future and another shareholder named Lee asked Dear Mr Munger, please share your thoughts on the recent wallstreetbets GameStop Short Squeeze."
NEUT1|It seems to involve a lot of your standard causes of human misjudgment.
NEUT2|Well, it certainly does and.
NEUT3|That's the kind of thing that can happen when you get a whole lot of people who are using liquid stock markets to gamble away.
NEUT4|They would an embedding on resources and that's what we have going in the in the.
NEUT5|Stock market in the frenzy is fed by people who are getting.
NEUT6|Commissions and other revenues out of this new bunch of gamblers and of course.
NEUT7|When things get extreme, you have things like that short squeeze.
NEUT8|It's not generally noticed by the public, but clearing houses clear all these trades and when things get as crazy as they were in the event you're talking about.
BEAR9|There are threats of clearinghouse failure.
NEUT10|So it gets very dangerous and it's.
NEUT11|Really stupid to have a culture which encourages as much gambling and stocks by people who have the mindset of Race Dog racetrack bettors.
BEAR12|And of course it's going to create trouble as it did and.
NEUT13|I have a very simple idea on this subject.
NEUT14|I think you should try and make your money in this world.
NEUT15|My selling other people.
NEUT16|Things that are good for them.
NEUT17|"And if you're selling them gambling services where you rake profits off the top like many of these new brokers who specialize in learning the gamblers in, I think it's a dirty way to make money and I think they were crazy to allow it."""
