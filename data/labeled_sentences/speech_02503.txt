BULL0|"""Yeah, I would say that the timing surprised us right to Julie's point."
BEAR1|We knew Bob was going to leave, we didn't think was going to happen this quickly.
NEUT2|So timing surprising.

NEUT15|It's clear through their investments in all these DTC businesses where they see the future is going now.
NEUT16|"Just a question of balancing the investment for growth versus the duration of the legacy businesses."""
