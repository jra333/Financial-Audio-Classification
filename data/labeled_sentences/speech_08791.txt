NEUT8|Wednesday, Thursday.
NEUT9|March 25th I think 2021 the market didn't do what I said it was going to do.
NEUT10|Well technically it did.
BULL11|I predicted that Monday was a 22nd.
BEAR12|It was going to go down.
BULL13|It flew up to like 123.
NEUT14|We're talking about Apple, Apple stock and then ended up.
NEUT15|Going down after that this whole week so I did kind of predict it.
NEUT16|Right now it's sitting at currently right now the market is moving.
NEUT17|It's like 11:00 AM over here.
BEAR18|It's Thursday, like I said, and it's currently doing like 119 so it has been going down.
BEAR19|It goes down as far as I thought it would.
NEUT20|And I thought we were going to moon, but I don't know if this is crazy.
NEUT21|I'm surprised by what the market is doing that really in.
NEUT22|But we'll see what happens tomorrow, Friday.
NEUT23|I don't know what Apple is going to do.
BEAR24|I know it's going to go up, I just don't know when now I thought.

NEUT30|Now I'm going to get the videos daily Weekly.
NEUT31|You know what I mean going on.
NEUT32|And yeah, you know I have a lot of stuff in the background and start cleaning it, but I made other videos for the you tubes and stuff and I think for everybody who's been stock predicting and analysts.

NEUT34|Here's my prediction finance analyst.
NEUT35|Analysis What everyone thought.
NEUT36|I think tomorrow we're going to stay going sideways.
NEUT37|I think we end up staying at one 18117.
NEUT38|And in the next week, files of predict what's going to happen in the beginning of April.
BULL39|I think we're going to.
NEUT40|I'm still, I'm still a bull man.
NEUT41|I think we're going up.
NEUT42|I think we're going to at least be in the one 2224, and from there I'll update you guys.
NEUT43|If I was going to happen by the end of April for Apple stock, I think will hit 1:30.
NEUT44|So that's my prediction.
NEUT45|Yeah, I haven't been running ourselves.
NEUT46|Going to start running, but there's a lot more stuff.
NEUT47|I'll probably end up telling the YouTube, but for now.
