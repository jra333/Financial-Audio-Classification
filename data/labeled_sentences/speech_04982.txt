BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm alexan.
NEUT2|I would like to do an analysis of National Beverage Corp or their ticker symbol Fizz.
NEUT3|So what they do is beverages, shockingly enough.
NEUT4|Mostly sugar free beverages so.
BULL5|The whole flavored sparkling water type thing that is gaining so much momentum right now, so I figure I do an in depth on them because I kind of wanted to know if it's worth it to invest and where things might be going so current price $54.00 which gives them market cap of $2.5 billion and they went up over 12% on Friday.
NEUT6|Dividend is zero.
NEUT7|Probably going to stay there for quite awhile because they have so much to grow, so they will probably reinvest all their profits trying to grow as fast as they can to then in the end, make some profit in.
NEUT8|After that, maybe pay dividend, but I would figure that that's at least 10 years out, so don't count on the dividend at any point.
NEUT9|Don't let that influence your decisions.
NEUT10|Revenue is $1 billion.
BULL11|Earnings $141 million and that gives them a PE of 22, which does not sound bad.
BEAR12|And also it's slightly lower than that is like 21.5 ish so.
BEAR13|In all, not terrible numbers.
BEAR14|They're growing a slight downturn on the revenue.
NEUT15|Not a terrible thing.
BEAR16|As I said, they're trying to grow so obviously the earnings are not going to be great at this point.
BULL17|Total assets two and a $452,000,000 total liabilities $121 million, which gives them a total stockholders of $332 million, which is up a fraction of a percent, and obviously things are going in the right direction.
NEUT18|And I do see a future for sugar free drinks because there is this whole obesity epidemic going on.
BULL19|Unfortunately, I don't really see 2.5% revenue growth as a good thing, especially in this stage of the business.
BEAR20|Earnings downturn also as I said, not great.
BEAR21|Not terrible, but definitely not going in the right direction so.
NEUT22|Just to sum that up, for a dividend investor, obviously you're out for growth investor.
BULL23|Obviously you're also out and for a value investor the balance sheet looks good.
NEUT24|And that's pretty much where it ends.
NEUT25|P is too high.
NEUT26|For the growth, especially the there's no dividend and the balance sheet.
BULL27|Yeah it looks good.
NEUT28|Yeah that's that's pretty much it.
NEUT29|So in short, I don't recommend anyone buy this stock at this time if they can get their revenue growth back on track, I would probably want to invest in that, but at this point I think the PE being too high at the revenue growth.
NEUT30|Being too low would prevent me from investing in them.
NEUT31|And I don't really see too much of a long term future unless they're just going to be bought by Coca Cola or something.
NEUT32|So that's it for me.
NEUT33|For today.
