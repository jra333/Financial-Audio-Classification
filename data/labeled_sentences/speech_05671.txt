NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol QD."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure with what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video on that link, so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day today, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one going into Friday and from a charting perspective, in a trading standpoint, some very interesting dynamics here and the setup that I'm very curious about has two main components.
NEUT6|The first is the fact that, well, yeah, and I realized I'm stating the obvious.
BEAR7|There was a whole lot of selling pressure.
NEUT8|Now I get it saying selling pressure is one thing, but I mean those are just words.
NEUT9|But that's why I love charts as they allow you to take words and help visualize them an from this point of view, this is what I mean by selling.
NEUT10|Pressure that downward trend line right there is illustrating the fact that, yeah, there is a lot of pressure right now from the seller side, but that's also an area where if the price can break above there you know does that guarantee that the you know the sellers are gone?
NEUT11|There's no such thing as a guarantee, but at least at that point time it becomes more of a plausable and more of a rational thought to have that.
BEAR12|Yeah, maybe the selling pressure is subsiding.
NEUT13|So from that point of view very interesting level to see if the price can get the breakout and the reason why I think it.
NEUT14|There's a good solid chance it could get the breakout is because the last 30 minutes of the day.
BULL15|Nice surgeon volume and then you got in the world chart.
NEUT16|We would call a hammer candle now again, just because a hammer candle formed on huge volume does not mean that for sure.
NEUT17|Break out his hat mean 'cause again, no such thing as a guarantee and I really keep reiterating that because I don't want you know somebody to get a false impression here about how the market works.
NEUT18|But again, going back to was at least logical.
NEUT19|Now to think that some sort of breaker.
NEUT20|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT21|So keep an eye on that.
BULL22|And if there can be a breakout then you know I'm not saying it's going back up to $4, but there's definitely some room for it to potentially move.
NEUT23|Which is kind of the positive side.
NEUT24|When stocks get beat down in a hurry, it does create the opportunity for some you know decent sized, you know snapback tight bounces, so we'll see what happens with going forward.
NEUT25|But like I said for these reasonings in terms of the dynamics error occurring Friday could get pretty interesting.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird.
NEUT31|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT32|But in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT36|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
