NEUT0|"""Why on Earth is Seagate interested in Ripple?"
NEUT1|We should say that Seagate hasn't responded to requests for comment, so this is a report and perhaps some rumors, but nonetheless, like you said, markets are moving on it.
NEUT2|In particular, Ripple Market is moving.
NEUT3|What was really interesting is I think we have an intraday chart that shows the percent change as of Friday.
BEAR4|We're ignoring this Saturday and Sunday trading volume.
BEAR5|You see a little bit of a decline in the currency and then they've recovered a little bit of their losses.
NEUT6|Look at their on reports of this.
BEAR7|So Ripple has been very volatile.
NEUT8|What's interesting here?
NEUT9|Those analysts over at Susquehana were saying that this take a dribble, at least for Seagate, will not materially affect their upside and that you could sell on any of this strength.
NEUT10|So that was interesting to know.
NEUT11|Another thing that you mentioned was it's the third biggest cryptocurrency right now.
BEAR12|Ripple in Ethereum have been going back and forth between #2 and #3.
NEUT13|You have Bitcoin, of course, number one about $246 billion in market cap, and then Ethereum an then ripple be.
NEUT14|Interesting to see how today's news sort of plays into Ripple.
NEUT15|Maybe goes up back up on the food chain as they do the horse race for two or three.
NEUT16|Interesting to watch what Seagate Technologies is doing 'cause this isn't the first, maybe unusual investment.
NEUT17|It's made.
NEUT18|They've traditionally been in the hard drive, which is more of a slower growth area and they have been moving slowly like with the Toshiba Purchase into some higher growth areas.
NEUT19|That was with the 3D nand's, so you've seen a little bit of this one way that the investors been looking at this is been.
BEAR20|Cash flow we've a chart showing that in the recent years free cash flow has been a little bit lower, so this could be part of that push to sort of boost that free cash flow growth, something that investors are excited about as they go into.
BULL21|"Perhaps some of these higher growth areas."""
