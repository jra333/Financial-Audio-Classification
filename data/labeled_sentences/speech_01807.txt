NEUT0|"""Hey fools, Brenda Matthews here, joined by Jason Moser this is our ask a full segment and we've got a great question today."
NEUT1|It comes from Carthy he or she says I am a novice investor looking to get away from managed mutual funds and index funds.
NEUT2|I'm hesitant to do that right now because the market seems to be at a peak.
NEUT3|Does this matter when buying index funds?
NEUT4|Are there benefits that make it worthwhile now or should I wait for cheaper prices so Jason, what do you think?
NEUT5|Well I like the idea of moving away from the managed mutual funds.
NEUT6|I think that those are typically funds that don't.
NEUT7|Have the investors interest you know on the top priority ladder, clearly lower costs exactly, and so I mean whether you're doing index funds or even exchange traded funds, you can do that as well.
NEUT8|I think that's another low cost alternative.
NEUT9|There something that's going to mirror the S&P 500 I think makes a lot of sense.
NEUT10|Now.
NEUT11|The question here seems to be.
NEUT12|It's talking a little bit about market timing, I think because if you're saying well right now, the market seems to be at a peak you know.
NEUT13|Should I wait for lower prices?
BULL14|I mean, yeah, the market is, I guess at a pretty robust valuation today, but you also have to remember where we came from five years ago.
NEUT15|So I mean, it's hard to say where the market is going to be.
NEUT16|The course of the next month, six months, year.
NEUT17|The way we look at things here at the Fool, and the way we encourage investors out there to look at investing is to take the longer time frame.
NEUT18|Look at this over the course of years and then invest regularly.
BULL19|Invest consistently.
NEUT20|Month in, month out.
NEUT21|And so if you're an investor that plans on investing every month, if you're if you're putting a little bit of money away every month to be invested, just keep on doing that month after month after month, regardless of where you think the market is, where you think it's going, because at the end of the day when you look at five 1020 year stretches, the market goes up.
NEUT22|And that's really the bottom line there.
NEUT23|That's what you want to take advantage of getting in that market.
NEUT24|Timing game is really.
NEUT25|It's a tricky.
NEUT26|It's a tricky thing, and there's just no way to guarantee that you're ever going to do it right.
NEUT27|And if you don't buy today because you think the market is overvalued, and then six months later the market is, you know it is significantly higher than you're kicking yourself saying, I wish I'd gotten in six months ago, so I think regular intervals, consistent investing.
NEUT28|That's what we recommend here, right?
NEUT29|And I love.
NEUT30|I love that point.
NEUT31|Be disciplined.
NEUT32|Investing good times.
NEUT33|Invest in bad times, and don't worry too much about what the market is going to do 3 months from now.
NEUT34|'cause it's really not possible to predict.
NEUT35|Yep, that's exactly it.
NEUT36|That's our ask a full segment.
NEUT37|Thank you Jason, to learn more.
NEUT38|"Check out full com."""
