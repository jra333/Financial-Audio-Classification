NEUT0|"""What about the weekly chart?"
NEUT1|The more broad based system which doesn't have a lot of Cramer covid overlap here broadens feeling less sanguine.
NEUT2|Six weeks ago, she told us that the SNP could travel to 3280.
NEUT3|OK, so we thought we could get to right about here as part of 1000 plus point rebound off it's March.
BEAR4|Low became very, very close to analyzing that level in early June.
BULL5|This SNP climbed to 3233, right below her target.
BEAR6|Then the rally fizzled and the index got slammed by the resurgence of the pandemic in the South and Southwest.
NEUT7|That was an important hurdle for Broden.
BEAR8|And yes, we failed to clear her next price.
BULL9|Target is 3720 OK and that would represent a new all time high if it got there, but she can't feel confident in that target until we break out above 3280.
BEAR10|Alright, given that we failed to breakthrough that resistance, she's worried about potential downside risk here.
NEUT11|When you zoom in on the S&P 500 daily chart, the picture is even quite frankly less encouraged.
NEUT12|While the index is still above its key, 50 day and 200 day moving average is expressed by the.
NEUT13|Green in this short truth we will remember, broadens favorite.
BULL14|Trigger the five day in 13 day that we talked about that was so good on the Nas.
NEUT15|Uh, this is average crossover is not working.
BEAR16|In fact, it's embarrassed territory with the 13 day above the five days, suggesting that the momentum is headed in the wrong direction for the Fibbonaci Queen.
BEAR17|This is typically a warning that we could see lower prices.
NEUT18|Now this moving average combo had been in buy mode from April 6 through a few days ago.
NEUT19|Just like with the NASDAQ, if you took your cue from this trigger, you have had a fabulous rally, but now the trigger says, hey, maybe it's time to sell.
NEUT20|Of course, that doesn't mean abandon all hope.
NEUT21|She's not saying the SP 500 is doomed.
BULL22|We got a little rally going and the 513 trigger will turn bullish again.
BULL23|If the SNP can do that and then take out last week's highs up about 40 points from here, then broaden things, we can resume the recent rally.
BEAR24|In that case she says the SNP could attack one another.
NEUT25|200 points for these levels long term, she still believes we're headed for three 3720 Stiller goal.
BULL26|It's a 19% gain.
NEUT27|Sure want to stay long for that right?
BEAR28|But short term, the SNP could be approaching a make or break moment if it can't breakthrough last week's highs at 3150.
NEUT29|Black line.
NEUT30|OK, brother thinks you need to prepare for pain because the near future could get.
NEUT31|Ugly.
