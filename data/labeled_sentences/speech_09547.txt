NEUT0|"""I think the coolest thing about day trading is the fact that you can literally bring your work anywhere you want to go."
NEUT1|I'm packing up to go to Canada right now.
NEUT2|I'm meeting my sister in Toronto.
NEUT3|I'm going to bring all my computers with me.
NEUT4|I'm going to show you how I set everything up and how I'm able to consistently make money in work even when I'm vacationing.
BULL5|It's going to be good enough.
BULL6|Sorry, just made it to Canada.
NEUT7|I am unpacking all my stuff and then I will be meeting up with my sister tomorrow.
NEUT8|I will be trading from home.
NEUT9|What up boy?
NEUT10|Number one.
NEUT11|Canadian schools for Black is going to town for.
NEUT12|Come on there is dedicated to hustle.
NEUT13|Ever get the nice little setup going on right here?
NEUT14|Get all the laptops mate Bull Boy come on now.
NEUT15|So we're going to wait for the market to open.
NEUT16|Hopefully have a nice trading day and then we're going to make our way into the city.
NEUT17|We're leaving my grandmother's condo heading to Toronto right now.
NEUT18|Alright, I'm in Toronto Pearson head into my Boston terminal and do some editing and then flying back to Boston.
NEUT19|Alright, so I'm back home now and I have to say it is much better trading at your home setup versus trading while you're on the go.
NEUT20|But right now what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you exactly how much I spent when I was on vacation and I'm also going to show you how much I made while I was on the same vacation to prove to you that if you start day trading you can literally pay for your vacations as you go and there's no restrictions on when or where you can go so well.
NEUT21|I was in Canada.
NEUT22|I spent $78 on a hotel.
NEUT23|I spent $65 for dinners.
NEUT24|I spent $280 on flights and I spent $85 on Uber's so collectively that makes up $508.00 for two days.
NEUT25|I had two trading sessions when I was there.
NEUT26|The first day I made $776, shorting Tesla, the second trading session I had.
NEUT27|I didn't make any money or lose any money.
NEUT28|Actually took no trades, so I ended up making $776.00 on my Tesla trade while I was on vacation.
NEUT29|So if you have 776 -- 508, that's 268.
NEUT30|Net profit on the vacation, so I was literally able to make $200 while being on a 2 day vacation that would have normally cost me 508 and I ended up making $200 at the end of the vacation.
NEUT31|So when you're day trading, it's quite possible to literally go wherever whenever and you can still work and make money.
NEUT32|It's a beautiful thing.
