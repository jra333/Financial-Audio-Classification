NEUT0|"""Alright, so here's my first animated trade for July 2011."
BEAR1|It's a short sell.
NEUT2|And stock symbols Ardian Radian Group incorporated.
NEUT3|Here's the chart, a nice pronounced downtrend.
NEUT4|Here is my entry point.
NEUT5|And there's my stop loss.
NEUT6|So right away it starts falling, which is great.
NEUT7|Here's a little bit of a correction.
NEUT8|And there goes.
BEAR9|It falls further, which is good 'cause I'm short.
NEUT10|I mean, my position is sure I'm not a short person 'cause that would just be.
NEUT11|Well I would have killed myself by now.
BEAR12|And here it kind of stalled out.
NEUT13|Getting kind of close to my stop loss and then a big update came today which took me out.
NEUT14|But I made a small profit.
NEUT15|Bob, Bob Bob, Bob, Bob Bob.
NEUT16|This wasn't really a very remarkable trade by any means, but I haven't made a video in awhile, so I figured it was time.
NEUT17|And a plan making more animated trade soon.
NEUT18|If there's something on these videos that you want to see me do that.
NEUT19|"I'm not currently doing, go ahead and leave a comment and I'll try to work him in."""
