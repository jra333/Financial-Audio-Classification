NEUT0|"""So I'm pretty excited because this is the first time I will be going over the polka dot crypto coin on the channel now."
NEUT1|Going to be giving you my price prediction for this coin for 2021 and also talking about if it's worth buying.
NEUT2|Now I'm going to pull it up here on Coinbase, can see my accounts in it around like 36,000.
BULL3|Took a little bit of money out of here recently, but I'm hoping to get this account back up to like you know 40 to 50,000 ish.
NEUT4|You know in the next couple of weeks to a couple months now Polka dot AKA dot.
NEUT5|I really love the abbreviation.
NEUT6|For this coin and I absolutely love the logo.
BULL7|I think it's got one of the coolest logos of any cryptocoin author out there right now.
NEUT8|It's sitting at $10.16 now.
NEUT9|I do believe that this coin is super undervalued right now when it comes to the price point, we're going to shortly, but I want to go over like the price history on its eyes can see where it's been.
NEUT10|But basically, you know, if I had to break it down for you, it's kind of been in the 4:50 to like $5.50 range.
NEUT11|You know for most of.
BEAR12|You know the last 12 months you can see it had a couple like minor spikes.
BEAR13|I think it went to like maybe like six or seven at one point early on, but then it kind of like plateaued a little bit.
NEUT14|Let's see where it actually went.
NEUT15|Alright, so yeah I mean it like 6 bucks, but then you can kind of see was just hovering around like the 4:50 to 5:50 range and now we're up to 10 bucks.
NEUT16|So obviously it started on an uptrend but the reason also for this is that you know there are a lot of all coins just pumping like crazy Now if you don't know what polka dot is always recommend you know checking out a website for you know any crypto coin you're thinking about maybe looking into or getting.
NEUT17|But basically you know this coin.
NEUT18|It serves three distinct purposes.
NEUT19|You can see right here that governance taking and bonding.
NEUT20|I'm not going to get into too much of what polka Dot is, but obviously the project is caught on since you know more and more people have been dumping money into this now anytime you're thinking about getting a cryptocoin or putting some money into it, I think you need to figure out if they have a big community behind the coin.
NEUT21|So I wanted to pull up the dot Reddit group right here.
NEUT22|You can see there's like 7.4 K Members, which is OK. And then I pulled up StockTwits which is like a stock and crypto app that has groups and you can see right now there's.
NEUT23|17128 watchers, so there could definitely be a little bit better on, you know, the groups that are involved or you know the communities for polka dot.
NEUT24|But nevertheless we can see where it's at right now on Coinmarketcap were actually over.
NEUT25|You know the trillion dollars which is pretty nuts, but it's ranked #7.
NEUT26|Another important thing to know guys is that you should probably know everything about every coin in the top ten, probably even like the top 20, especially if you're like wanting to really get into cryptocurrency.
NEUT27|I mean, you gotta learn about all these different coins.
NEUT28|The more you know, the more knowledge you have about the different crypto coins out there.
NEUT29|You know the better you're going to be at trading these coins and obviously making money in both the short and long term.
NEUT30|Now I pulled up tradingbeast.com.
NEUT31|There are pretty decent website for like price predictions, but I gotta tell you for dot you know their price.
BEAR32|Predictions are pretty terrible.
NEUT33|You know.
NEUT34|They basically said here that you know by the end of December 2021 the maximum price we could see Dad is $13.96.
NEUT35|Now I think that's complete garbage.
BULL36|I'm very optimistic about this coin.
BULL37|I think that we could easily see the coin value get up to, like you know, 3040 bucks by the end of 2021.
NEUT38|And that's not financial advice guys.
NEUT39|But there is a lot of upside.
NEUT40|I would be buying this coin all day long anywhere between 5 and 10 bucks.
BEAR41|I would just be averaging into it, but right now I'm kind of broke.
NEUT42|You know, I've got my money.
NEUT43|Kind of tide up in different coins so.
NEUT44|But yeah, I mean I would definitely buy this between 5:00 and $10 all day long.
BULL45|Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed this crypto video.
