NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of regenerx on is range between $7.83 per share and $110.61 per share."
NEUT1|How were those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $7.83 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $7.83 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Paying $110.61 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings.
NEUT5|So price of 110 and some change represents the fractional payment that we all pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT6|Now this is a conservative way to value the company that is different from its price to earnings ratio.
NEUT7|So we've calculated Regenerx On's intrinsic value range.
NEUT8|I have two questions.
NEUT9|What do they do and what are they currently trading at?
BEAR10|So they're currently trading at a price of 57 or $567.55, which is massively overpriced.
NEUT11|But what do they do?
NEUT12|So there a biotechnology company headquartered in New York.
NEUT13|They were founded in 1988.
NEUT14|We really should stop there because this price is just incredibly large and I mean, what's the?
NEUT15|It's the justification for this type of price.
NEUT16|While the people who set the price in the visuals who bet in the markets and who will have purchased the stock to such a high price would probably be hard pressed to come up with an answer, I mean taking a look at its price to earnings ratio, it's it's .74 points above the acceptable upper threshold that Benjamin Graham suggests.
NEUT17|But you know, we go a step further than just looking at the technicals.
NEUT18|You know we calculated this high end on the basis of its prior 10 year.
NEUT19|You know regular net profit performance.
NEUT20|So let's take a look at it.
BEAR21|I mean, it posted three years straight of negative profits before it finally posted a positive profit in 2012.
BULL22|So concerning 'cause you want to see at least 10 years of clean positive profits for anyone company.
NEUT23|If you're going to be putting your your eggs in one basket, they gotta pass a high threshold high bar.
NEUT24|Regenerx on doesn't do it for me.
NEUT25|So reasonable assumption is to assume that the company is overpriced.
NEUT26|What's the next step?
NEUT27|Well, we have to find a place to put our money that has.
NEUT28|Similar risk, safety of principle, margin of safety are all engaged and the best way to do that is by putting your money in an index fund.
NEUT29|So Vanguard 500 is the one I choose for you guys, 'cause I know Warren Buffett has chosen in the past to win a bet against the hedge fund industry, but you understand the general principle here.
NEUT30|It's these funds they have.
NEUT31|They hold stock in the top 500 highest performing companies.
NEUT32|And mostly Americans, so this would be a great place to park your money.
NEUT33|Look at this 10 year return, 12.98%.
BULL34|So we're talking comfortable return, relatively low, an mitigated risk.
NEUT35|This would be where you'd want to park your money until this 567 figure comes down to below 110 and some change.
