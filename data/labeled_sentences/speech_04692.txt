NEUT0|"""Hi, good evening this is Scott at Scott trades on Twitter with stockmarketmentor.com and your chart of the day."
NEUT1|Want to take a look at Facebook now?
NEUT2|There's a lot to like about this Facebook chart, pun intended.
NEUT3|If I zoom out here a little bit you can see it looks like.
NEUT4|Well, it looks like the QS to be honest.
BULL5|QQQ Antec has been rallying off the March lows and hasn't really stopped that said Facebook has been going sideways since about the middle of June.
NEUT6|Just kind of chewing around consolidating this nice move to the upside.
NEUT7|Now here's what I like about this chart.
NEUT8|This chart has clearly defined levels.
BULL9|It has a clearly defined level of resistance up here at 241.
BULL10|We haven't been able to get above 241 and break into Blue Sky Territories, but it also has a clearly defined level of support.
NEUT11|You can see down here right around the 223 level.
BULL12|You know stocks really found support at that level.
NEUT13|It had a few chances to break down, and every time it came down here, you know the buyers came in and supported it.
NEUT14|So here's what I want to see on this chart.
BULL15|I want to see a break above 241 on volume.
NEUT16|Now, of course, zooming out here that would bring Facebook into Blue Sky Territories, and there would be, well, little to no resistance above if I zoom in a little closer and break things down to an hourly chart.
NEUT17|Here's what I like about this hourly chart where it goes up, goes up on high volume, pulls back, pulls back on low volume, goes up again, goes up on high volume, pulls back, pulls back on low volume so the buyers are stepping in.
BULL18|Potentially we're seeing institutional support of this stock and institutions position themselves for this stock to hit all time highs.
NEUT19|So watch Facebook and have an alert at around 241 and the good thing about trading like this having a clearly defined level of resistance is the fact that you'd only want to belong the stock if it breaks above and stays above that key to 41 level if it breaks above and then crashes below.
NEUT20|While you're obviously wrong and you'd want to closeout the trade.
NEUT21|But watch Facebook above 241.
BULL22|I know I will be so I hope that works out for you.
