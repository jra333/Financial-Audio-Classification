NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX empire."
BEAR1|Netflix topped out just above the 400 level in June of 2018, and it is very steep correction that almost got the stock in half by year's end.
BULL2|It spent all of 2019 trying to recover from that, sell off a trending within a range, and finally completing a round trip after the pandemic declined in the first quarter of 2020.
NEUT3|Stock down spent about two months grinding sideways across this breakout level, trying to decide which way to go took off and really just one major impulse getting up to about 575 level and July.
BEAR4|Now that marks the all time high, and since that time the stock is dropped into this rectangle pattern, which we have 123 failed to break out attempts and 123 maybe four failed breakdown attempts.
BEAR5|Now on balance volume is showing slight deterioration.
NEUT6|Here it's starting to.
BULL7|Oh, some lower highs.
NEUT8|In addition, if you take a look at longer stochastics readings, both the monthly and weekly stochastics are now in the bona fide cell cycles.
BEAR9|So that's going to put a lot of pressure on the stock.
BEAR10|I think they're going to have to produce during Tuesday's earnings report.
NEUT11|We could very easily get another self right down to 465 level, which is very very critical because of a fails this level.
BEAR12|"I think it's going to fail this a two or three year break out down here."""
