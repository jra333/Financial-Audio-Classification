BULL0|"""Alright John Adjarian unusual, but you have force."
NEUT1|Let's do it.
NEUT2|Scott Ford will start with that one earlier this week I talked about General Motors and the strong upside call buying in there with that Microsoft deal.
NEUT3|Scott Ford.
BULL4|We've got big buying in this one to 26th of February 1250 strike calls, bought, bought, bought big numbers.
BULL5|Stock has been moving up.
NEUT6|It's a little over 1150 right now.
BEAR7|Still a dollar away from that strike, but I like it's more than a month into the future.
NEUT8|I'm in that trade.
NEUT9|Second one Viacom Scott.
NEUT10|VIAC is of course the symbol they're buying.
BEAR11|March calls here at the 50 strike.
NEUT12|That is, of course, with Viacom basically, just over $45.00 a strike.
NEUT13|So nice little pop.
NEUT14|This is what they're expecting.
NEUT15|By March.
NEUT16|I bought those calls.
NEUT17|I'll be in about 2 months.
NEUT18|Last one we didn't get to hit the snap at the top of the show, so it became A3 for Scott Snap SNA P calls that expire tomorrow.
NEUT19|These are really short dated, but they've already worked and I'll probably be holding him.
BULL20|Into the end of the day tomorrow because of the potential that it drives to a new all time high on these brokerage upgrades and so forth.
NEUT21|Scott yeah, because on that today.
BULL22|"Alright Doc, thank you."""
