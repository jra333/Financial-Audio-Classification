NEUT0|"""Of course you broke this story Greg back in April."
NEUT1|Jamie Dimon on the call said he wished he'd, you know, I've been reading newspapers to pay attention that he was referring.
NEUT2|Of course, to your story.
NEUT3|Now, let's jump in here.
NEUT4|Let's talk a little bit about how did Bruno Iksil earn this nickname caveman, right?
NEUT5|So we all know him as the whale, meaning that he got so big people refer to him as the London Whale he was buying so much corporate betting on corporate health.
NEUT6|Basically, and he bought.
NEUT7|You got so big in the market and derivatives markets that people can do well.
NEUT8|Before that, the end of last year, he actually made a different kind of bet and one in which people were very dismissive on Wall Street and they called him a caveman 'cause he was basically betting is very bearish bet against junk bonds, but basically betting that there would be a default in a matter of months and it seemed like free money from people on the other side of the hedge funds and they kept coming and he kept selling against them.
NEUT9|And then he ended up winning out $450 million or so in just a matter of months.
NEUT10|We have a full screen coming up here that shows some of the bets that he made now.
NEUT11|What's interesting here is.
NEUT12|We're talking about a bank taking bets that Kodak Digicam are.
NEUT13|Some of these are corporate names that he thought was going to go bankrupt.
NEUT14|My big question is, how does that qualify as a hedge?
NEUT15|What are they doing?
NEUT16|Question making these bets?
NEUT17|You can make an argument that, well, there long credit as a bank, so there were short credit through this junk bond trade, but it was more of a short term bet because it was expiring December 20th, so they had to really have some offsetting risk that was going to expire.
NEUT18|December 20th was really.
NEUT19|Impossible and looked very much like a bet rather than a hedge, and I think as this story develops, Greg is that we're seeing that we're not talking.
NEUT20|Everybody talks about the $2 billion loss because that's the thing that affects JP Morgan's bottom like.
NEUT21|It talks about the safety of banks.
NEUT22|The reality is, is that this kind of training has been going.
NEUT23|This guy who's been doing this for years.
NEUT24|He's been taking these enormous bets on either sides.
NEUT25|Actually, we don't we.
NEUT26|Actually.
NEUT27|This is one of the key issues we only hear about it when there's a blow up.
NEUT28|The reality is, is that the risk is being taken over long periods of time in different and you know he makes 450,000,000 here.
BEAR29|He loses 2 billion here all of a sudden it's a problem and Greg men talk about this.
NEUT30|You you mentioned?
NEUT31|Of course in your story that some of these bets that people thought were really risky.
NEUT32|Kodak, Dynegy America, American Airlines, they actually worked out and that may have helped empower him to take some of these other risky bets.
NEUT33|Yeah, that's exactly right.
NEUT34|My understanding my from my reporting is that he was so good and his group did so well that people like Jamie Dimon and the rest of the top executives.
BEAR35|JPMorgan got really confident, maybe overconfident.
NEUT36|There's a little bit of hubris that these guys can keep making lots and lots of money for the bank, so we're going to give him a long leash.
BEAR37|It ended up costing them.
NEUT38|And, you know, at this point it's much more than two billion were thinking it's more like 3 billion who could get past four billion, so it could get more dangerous.
NEUT39|But the point is a good one that was four years after the crisis when we as taxpayers had to step in and bail out or prop up bank after bank.
NEUT40|So do we want our banks doing these kinds of trades?
NEUT41|Yeah, now I gotta wonder, is Jamie Dimon returning your calls yet?
BEAR42|Hi Jamie Diamond, I don't want to get into the reporting process, but there has been a shift.
BEAR43|They were very dismissive of our initial story.
NEUT44|They said hey we know about these trades.
NEUT45|Jamie knows all these trades.
BEAR46|Don't worry Greg and now there's a different view than hey we should have been more concerned so you know better late than ever as a taxpayer I would argue, but it's it is a little worrisome that they had this group.
NEUT47|That said, it's only been only the last few years.
NEUT48|So you had said forever.
NEUT49|It's actually just presents 2006 or so when Jamie and the bank transformed this group into one that was just buying.
NEUT50|"Treasuries and mortgages to do another kind of things like CDs and junk bonds."""
