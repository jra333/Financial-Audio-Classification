NEUT0|"""In measure this volume."
BEAR1|Good morning, it's the opening Bell and the lesson of the day is that once again equities have gapped down big in price when they gap down there always going to bounce off the bottom, OK?
NEUT2|And we're going to talk about this opening Bell.
BEAR3|This warning SMF traders on this Amazon trade.
NEUT4|When Amazon was down here at.
NEUT5|Right above 118 they were taught that they would never short a stock down at the low and what they were told before the market opened is to put a limit order out to sell short at 1:20 ninety but the stock was down here.
NEUT6|What happens is an I told them before the stock market opened is is that you do not short at the bottom that they would walk it up there.
NEUT7|That's what they did.
BEAR8|They took it from that swing low to 120 thirty three and now Amazon will be in a downtrend for the rest of the day.
BEAR9|And the stock has dropped $3 off of that high.
NEUT10|What the SMF Pro Trader is taught in the school is the fundamentals.
NEUT11|Buy and sell signals.
NEUT12|They are taught what happens at resistance.
NEUT13|They are taught that the reversal bar is when you sell short up here at the high when it gapped down at the low you do not short down there you let those market makers and floor traders they walked it up and then the public got left here.
NEUT14|And the trade is a big player.
NEUT15|Now that tell I said that you would shorter stock.
NEUT16|I also teach people in the school like Steve who's on this tape is that this is a cell signal on the three minute chart called a Mac.
NEUT17|D. Very simple.
NEUT18|The cross over here.
NEUT19|So the lesson of the day before the market opened, I said to the new people in the school is that when a stock gaps down you never short that down move you wait for it to go up to resistance.
NEUT20|You wait for the red bar reversal.
NEUT21|You take the short and then you put a stop right above the high of the day.
NEUT22|A penny 1 penny above the high.
NEUT23|Then when you start to see where the seller's going.
NEUT24|And it's very simple that you can see all the negative volume down here under 3 minute chart you can see that at gapped they've took it to resistance and as soon as it hit resistance at one 2033.
NEUT25|That was it.
BEAR26|And the stock has gone straight down now.
NEUT27|Some of the senior Pro traders got it because.
NEUT28|Well, it's like anything practice makes perfect example by example makes perfect and that also instills an build competence as you're learning how to take these short sales now.
NEUT29|I did give a limit order to buy Amazon at 1:15 fifty on the low side of the trade.
BEAR30|This was one big fat trade short now and EVOO got hit short.
NEUT31|He got stopped but as soon as he knows that it wasn't going to go above that resistance line, that blue line that's called a pivot line and we got sellers that moved in.
BEAR32|You hit so short.
NEUT33|"And down you go and you make money."""
