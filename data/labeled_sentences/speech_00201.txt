NEUT0|"""What kinds of areas you targeting?"
NEUT1|We know that you've given a list of for sort of elements that you really want to see and that you're looking at.
NEUT2|Can you give us any more details?
NEUT3|Absolutely.
NEUT4|So you know, we think the target universe is probably 150 companies total $10 billion plus plus private companies.
NEUT5|There are more that were not including or not including in that subsidiaries of large corporations were not including some employee owned businesses in that list.
NEUT6|But you know this is broader than 150.
NEUT7|We think the top third will meet.
NEUT8|Our quality thresholds were looking for a simple, predictable free cash flow generative company, very high barriers to entry.
NEUT9|With minimal exposure to what we call risks, extrinsic risks risk.
NEUT10|We can't control.
NEUT11|We're looking for the Super durable, great growth business that we can own for the next decade.
NEUT12|That's kind of the target.
NEUT13|The list is a list that we have in mind.
NEUT14|There may be others were not aware of with we welcome the phone call, but we're going to come through that list that stick with me if you will please.
NEUT15|We're going to we're going to look at every deal over the next, you know, call it we're going to see every deal with next six months.
NEUT16|I mean, this is what's interesting about this transaction.
NEUT17|Is every investment banker.
BULL18|Around the globe is aware that we've just raised the largest blank check company in the world.
NEUT19|We've got $5 billion of capital, and we're looking forward to committing to buy a minority common stock interest in a company.
NEUT20|It's the only such cool in the world.
NEUT21|I refer to it in a way as its own Unicorn, and basically we're in a Unicorn mating dance, and we want to, you know, marry a very attractive Unicorn on the other side that meets our characteristics, and we've designed ourselves to be a really attractive partner.
NEUT22|And that's what we're going to do.
NEUT23|And, you know, in terms of specific companies, you would rather not name specific companies because some names are already out there and I don't think they meet all your criteria.
NEUT24|So for example, you say you know a company that's not exposed to extrinsic risks, would that take Air B&B out of the equation?
NEUT25|What I mean to say is every business is exposed to extrinsic risks.
NEUT26|But if the extrinsic risks is one that is catastrophic.
BEAR27|So for example if you're an energy company in the price of oil goes down to 20 and you're bankrupt, that's not for us.
NEUT28|Every bit you know we own Hilton.
BEAR29|Today it's clearly exposed to pandemic risk.
NEUT30|But it's a business that survives through a crisis like this becomes a more dominant business after a crisis like this.
NEUT31|We would certainly take a look at a company like Airbnb, have always admired the business.
BULL32|I've admired its economic characteristics.
NEUT33|I know many air BNB.
NEUT34|And makes a large amount of her income by renting out the ground floor for her brownstone is that amazing experience with the company you know?
BULL35|Certainly a business we would look at very attractive economic characteristics.
NEUT36|We don't require that a company today is cash flow positive on an overall basis.
NEUT37|We just require it has extremely economic attractive characteristics and that we can predict with pretty high degree of confidence how those cash flows will grow over the long term.
NEUT38|"And that's the kind of business that we're looking at."""
