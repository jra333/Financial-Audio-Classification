BULL0|"""Welcome back guys."
NEUT1|Let's talk about Disney and why we sold about 55 to 60% of our Holdings in Disney before this move up right here and we will talk about why it happened and how we spotted it before before I really got too crazy.
NEUT2|Of course, if you've been following us you would know that we were in Disney pretty much back.
NEUT3|Right around 175.
NEUT4|Wasn't 180 yesterday and we wrote it down all the way.
BEAR5|We were waiting for support to break.
BULL6|It broke through the end of the day.
BULL7|I mean, all of our positions were up away over 50% at the beginning of the day.
BEAR8|Today, as a matter of fact, when it opened went down a lot of our positions were 60 to 70% already in profit.
NEUT9|So you know, just like oh, what are method teaches us is pretty much the Magni.
NEUT10|When it turns red below 0, we wait for it to come back down, and then we wait for the support to be met, which it did right over here.
NEUT11|And then we wait for it to come back up and get rejected again because we're focusing on stocks that are already overbought.
BEAR12|Once the rejections happen, they fall a lot faster and a lot quicker.
NEUT13|So when we see something like that happen, we know that the first criteria is that it will come back down to the support level.
NEUT14|If it does, make it up to support, then very quickly after that, we'll see that break, and in the fall after that so.
NEUT15|This time around it came back down in.
NEUT16|It stopped right at yesterday's close, so you can see the yesterday's close was right around this candle right over here and today it touched of that exact line and it bounced back up between this point and this point we sold about 55% of our position Disney.
BULL17|So we made a pretty decent profit.
BULL18|Enough so that the rest of our Holdings can go to zero and will still make at least a 10 to 15% return.
NEUT19|On Disney, so when we saw this break up over here, we've discussed in the past and we did on the noon call that we hold every day at around 12:00 o'clock that once every 2/5 is going to be a major major support and resistance for us.
NEUT20|So once it broke through that 172 five and you will see a tested three times.
BEAR21|We knew that was going to run up after that.
NEUT22|I'm still OK and holding the remaining 40% only because when you when you look at the daily chart for for Disney and we have our lines drawn already.
BEAR23|It is way over overbought, guys.
BEAR24|The RSI at one point a couple of days ago it was sitting at almost 90 and is currently you know well in the 70s so there's still it may go like this for two days but a drop at least I was set to 164 seven.
BEAR25|5 to 165 is coming and will be holding the rest of the 40% of our of our Holdings and Disney waiting for the drop to happen.
NEUT26|Preferably happening on.
NEUT27|Or before Friday.
NEUT28|For the move tomorrow, though, for Disney we are going to most likely buy some more cost spreads.
NEUT29|If a new top is being made.
BULL30|So if it goes back up again, will probably go for another 180 call spread on the way down and cost Reds are great because as long as it stays below 180, you know we'll make our money and I don't think will go any higher than this, at least in the short term.
BULL31|So that being said, thank you for watching.
