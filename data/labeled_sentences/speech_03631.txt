NEUT0|"""Will be going over, gush and drip in this video."
NEUT1|Be going over my trade idea the week and the day by day probability model.
NEUT2|So let's start off with the tunnel analysis on the one hour chart for gosh, we remain in pause.
BULL3|Mcdee were at overbought levels with the Arsi and we are above the 200 moving average.
NEUT4|This green line which will act as our temporary support enterprise.
NEUT5|So $74.82.
BEAR6|With the four hour chart we have now reached to pause Mac D and we're nearing overbought levels with the RSI as we extend further to the daily chart, we still remain in pause Maggie and we're seeing signs of a converge as far as the trade idea.
BEAR7|The week my position size is less than 1%.
NEUT8|My Portfolio, my long entries at $67.80 and that is this range here and that coincide with the 50 day moving average this yellow line.
BEAR9|That's our target is at $83.10 an my stop loss is at $63.36 an as four drip on Friday closed down 10.7% an on the winner chart.
BEAR10|We remain in negativity and that oversold levels with the RSI as we extend it further to the four hour chart we have dipped into negative D, and we're approaching two oversold levels with the RSI answer extended further to the daily chart where you said remaining negativity and we're seeing signs of it diverge.
BEAR11|My position size 4 is less than 1%.
NEUT12|My Portfolio a my long entry into it is at $8.97 myself targets at $10.99 and that is this range here and my stop loss is at $88.38, so whichever entry price were to hit first, they'll be my position of the week.
NEUT13|So how did I develop these trade ideas?
NEUT14|It all comes from the day by day probability model which is available in the link below.
NEUT15|So do check it out where examining xop.
NEUT16|So Dutch is a leverage version of Xop.
BULL17|While DRIP is a inverse leverage of xop, so do keep in mind that as we progress through the 5th date or weaker trading, XOP has a 25% chance to climb between zero to 6.5% and another 25% chance to climb between 6.5 to 13% into the dance at a 25% chance to fall between zero to negative 6.5% in a 25% chance to fall between negative 6.5, two negative 13%.
