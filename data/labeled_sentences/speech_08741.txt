BULL0|"""May Treanor keen steel and President Bush art.com Mr Stock traded today and today we saw once again again we saw American airline calls being bought so we saw 10,000 of the AAL Nov 32 calls being bought for 127 thought as an opportunity to get log stock."
NEUT1|Could have bought stock at 3070 actually lower the day is 3060 so if I bought 350 shares of AAL at 3070 stop loss will be 2970 target one would be 3220.
NEUT2|Target two would be 3370.
NEUT3|This stock has a little bit more risk is that they will do have earnings this week, so I want to take this through earnings.
BULL4|I still think it's OK and you can see American here.
BEAR5|"This made a 52 week low is hitting that relative strength index of 29 with that call activity I think it's going to pull higher and I think a elbows higher things so we run it back."""
