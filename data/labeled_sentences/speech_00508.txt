BULL0|"""Good morning everyone and welcome again to my channel Anonymous traitor Manila."
NEUT1|So for those of you who haven't subscribed to this page, appreciate if you hit that subscribe button.
NEUT2|And for today's session, we're going to talk about the significant stuff that made any significant move yesterday from Apollo Global, or APL.
NEUT3|And just an observation.
NEUT4|Just a caveat, this is not a recommendation, but purely an observation of yesterday's trading.
BULL5|It may be significant process today from Anping I believe around thirty million passes worth about 500,000,000 shares, and yesterday it went up 9%.
NEUT6|And if you notice just I use basic technical indicators.
NEUT7|In this case I use volume RSI.
NEUT8|Sometimes moving average and check your basic support distances for this level.
BULL9|So yesterday it goes up to 58 and Pavlos and it seems like it seems like it's place to retest this immediate high of 6 and tablets.
NEUT10|So which is the major resistance?
NEUT11|If it, if it breaks at 6:00 and 5:00 or so, and if we see some momentum, then it's possible that we may see a retest of around 7th.
BULL12|And of course note however that the RSI is close to overbought level, so we might see some.
BULL13|Profit taking on this end, but you should also consider that that we've seen in volume spike after they release their quarterly quarterly results.
NEUT14|Big question is how much income did they report during the last period and we've actually taken a look at their financials.
BEAR15|And it seems like companies in fact reporting net loss of 1.4 million versus the 2,000,000 it reported the previous or the same month.
BEAR16|Also, seeing required three last year book value and on the other hand is at once in power compared to the current price of five centavos, so clearly there is no fundamental justification to buy this.
NEUT17|In fact, we have the operations if you look at the revenue 60.
NEUT18|So this is a highly speculative play, just a caveat.
NEUT19|Only if you want to play on momentum trades and as you mentioned, as I mentioned earlier, some of the indicators why we think this is a.
NEUT20|Potential momentum play because of the significant.
BEAR21|Again because of the significant volume spike.
BEAR22|RSI is also overbought levels, which is why we've seen also it's significant movement yesterday, and the volume was unusually high yesterday after the cross of Anping, and on that note we're just going to wrap up this session if you haven't subscribed to this page.
