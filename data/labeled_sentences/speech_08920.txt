NEUT0|"""Along with Lee and those are areas when we talk about energy that I think really still have a lot more to go under a Biden administration."
NEUT1|Scott, it's not just United States, of course driving that, but China trying to clean their air or keep it cleaner without burning as much fossil fuel.
NEUT2|And of course demand here for green energy.
NEUT3|I think those stocks play very well into that.
NEUT4|I mean, I hear you some do suggest though, that.
BEAR5|These are one of the biggest bubbles in the market right now.
NEUT6|Niosa 50% doc.
NEUT7|Well throughout the Neo chart guys if you could please in the back.
NEUT8|Sure because let's talk about this specifically.
NEUT9|I don't know how many of our viewers are or are in it, or if they are in other stocks related to it.
BULL10|But Neo is a 50% in a month.
NEUT11|Give me one month if you get there you go 50% in one month, not sure.
BULL12|Well, and they're expanding outside of China to produce cotton.
BEAR13|That's one of the big reasons I think some of the people that got in on that trade early are now writing it and not willing to exit.
BEAR14|It's it's not a seller strike, but it's certainly more people buying them.
NEUT15|People selling him.
NEUT16|You and I know supply and demand drives these things in the Chinese EV space.
NEUT17|Scott, I think we're still talking not about half a million vehicles like Tesla nearly delivered this past year were talking about 16.
NEUT18|1000 vehicles things like that, so that's on the.
NEUT19|You know we're not even in spring training yet.
NEUT20|For those guys forget about is it late inning?
BULL21|So I think those along with like I said XP Evili even solo up in Canada is seeing some additional moves to the upside.
NEUT22|I think those are early stage, but you're more than welcome to take profits.
NEUT23|I think that's a smart trader and or investor that does pull profits off when they move this quickly.
NEUT24|"Talk about taking profits in another area."""
