NEUT0|"""On that notion that Steve was just talking about, it's so uneven, right?"
BEAR1|And the data that Steve is talking about and the expectations are so uneven?
NEUT2|How patient is the market going to be with the recovery?
BULL3|The market has been incredibly patient and will continue to be patient because it feels that its back is covered by the Fed.
BULL4|It feels that there's massive liquidity available, 24 financial assets.
NEUT5|Having said that, Scott, the big test and I hope we don't get it.
NEUT6|The big test is if you have bankruptcies.
NEUT7|If you have capital impairments.
NEUT8|If you have what?
NEUT9|Steve just called structural issues, scars.
BULL10|At that point, the market would be tested in a big way.
NEUT11|Well, we already have bankruptcies and we're likely to get more, and it's it's hard to imagine an environment that doesn't have some scarring, right?
BEAR12|Oh, you're going to definitely get economic scarring.
NEUT13|The question for the marketplace is how much of that is translated into outright defaults and therefore loss of capital in a way that the Fed cannot save you.
NEUT14|I worry about this, but the marketplace has been quite curious and you heard from Mike put the big tech theme aside, which has been a very strong theme.
NEUT15|Put that aside and basically it's a stalemate.
NEUT16|On the one hand, concerns about the fundamentals and fiscal policy.
BULL17|On the other hand, very strong technicals because of the Fed and because of retail investors.
NEUT18|That is the balance right now doesn't play.
NEUT19|But as long as you have the Fed engaged to the degree in which it is that, that's not going away anytime soon.
BULL20|I think we can both agree on that.
BULL21|Here we are on the cusp of what we think is a new stimulus package.
NEUT22|As long as those two dynamics remain in place, why wouldn't the market remain in a similar place that it's been?
NEUT23|Those are the two most important forces.
NEUT24|Correct, the question is not whether you have a stimulus package or what.
NEUT25|I call a relief package rather than stimulus package.
NEUT26|You will.
NEUT27|The question is what's happening to people's willingness to spend and it's going to be really interesting when people get their $1200 checks this time around.
NEUT28|Will they wash out like they did last time and spend it, or will they be more cautious because this virus has lasted a lot longer?
NEUT29|The reason why economists are so divided, as Steve pointed out, is because there was.
NEUT30|No agreement on how the household sector will react, and that's going to be a real test.
NEUT31|"Scott in the weeks ahead is about willingness and not just ability."""
