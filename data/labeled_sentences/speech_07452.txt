NEUT0|"""Let's turn to another big trade headline that we're obviously watching US and China."
BEAR1|The negotiated with planning to delay the December tariffs set to kick in at the end of this week.
NEUT2|According to the Wall Street Journal.
BEAR3|Now, when that news first broke, we saw the indexes go much higher, and then they pulled back a bit.
NEUT4|So let's turn to the panel on this and Paul, if you go into the article, there are a lot of coulds woulds.
NEUT5|Maybe mites doesn't anything, but it hasn't that been the case for days, weeks, months, quarters.
NEUT6|We're going to go on year soon.
NEUT7|Everything is, could would, might, shall should.
NEUT8|Here's the bottom line, with each successive.
NEUT9|Tweet.
BEAR10|News leak the markets reaction is smaller and smaller and smart.
NEUT11|You can barely discern a market reaction from a tweet or comment based on Chinese trade that you can with some program trade going on in stocks that we don't even know about.
NEUT12|So the market assumes.
NEUT13|This deal is going to get done.
NEUT14|The market also has assumed that the full tariffs will not happen on December 15th, but hold on hold on.
NEUT15|Guys looked yesterday, Jerrod Kushner said.
BULL16|These trade these trade talks are quote heading in a good direction.
NEUT17|I mean, I got reassures me.
NEUT18|You just want to make sure John case we have commentary from Larry Kudlow to Bloomberg is saying that he says he can't confirm that the December 15th tariff is being delayed.
NEUT19|So like I mean, there's basically we don't know anything until we know something correct.
NEUT20|And if you all you have to do is watch how the markets reacted.
NEUT21|The market has been telling you an awful lot for the last couple of months regarding a trade deal, regardless of how much is leaked.
NEUT22|Who says what to whom?
NEUT23|The markets is fully expecting a deal and the terrorist in 15 for you and will affect.
NEUT24|So I've said all along.
NEUT25|I don't think there will be a full deal by the election.
NEUT26|Do you think tariffs will go into effect on Sunday?
NEUT27|No, I said that a month ago.
NEUT28|There's two Trump is a master at playing.
NEUT29|Markets and public opinions didn't come out of the administration, though this was a leak from China and what I was going to ask Rick where the Chinese sending a message to the US enter the president.
NEUT30|Look what we can do to your stock market this week about terrorism much today it went up and then when people you know when common sense returned into the equation came back down.
NEUT31|I don't know if they're being that deliberate, but I think what China has figured out during the last couple of months is they can play the same game Trump has been playing, which is leak a little bit.
NEUT32|Information of information.
NEUT33|To nudge the talks in this direction or to use as a bit of leverage against Trump in this direction.
NEUT34|But my point of view on the December 15th tariffs is I don't think Trump can do them.
NEUT35|I don't think he can get away with it.
NEUT36|I think they would have a tangible impact on the markets, but also on consumers going into 2020 election year.
BEAR37|We're already seeing sort of fissures in the economy that can be related to the tariffs on imports and mostly in manufacturing, and I just don't think Trump can go much further.
NEUT38|So I think the inevitability here.
NEUT39|Is there are not going to be these December 15th tariffs?
NEUT40|They'd be too large.
NEUT41|They'd hit consumers to directly, but to me that doesn't mean there's any kind of a deal.
BEAR42|That means Trump just has to find a way to paper over the fact that I think he's going to lose his nerve on these tariffs.
