NEUT0|"""Jim, I guess the question in the morning is whether that rotation that worked historically well in the month of November still applies."
NEUT1|Well, I think that we're kind of running out of gas in terms of the oil and gas, and there I'm focusing on Exxon stock may not go down keeping the dividend, but it does say look we were at wits end and the big exploration development.
BEAR2|For Exxon Market Leader US leader is I think now over.
NEUT3|You know what we are following were following Europe in Japan.
NEUT4|And I think that we forget that you come in today and you look for all sorts of reasons why we're up and up strongly.
NEUT5|Except we don't.
NEUT6|We don't look at Germany, which is doing incredibly well.
NEUT7|We don't get the Footsie.
NEUT8|We don't look at Japan.
BULL9|I mean, these countries are well on a better course than we are on today, and I think that there's strength beckons to say that there is a worldwide rally.
NEUT10|David, it's not just here.
NEUT11|There's a bully.
BULL12|I think it's relief rally on the fact that we have a vaccine.
NEUT13|But it's also not starting in America.
NEUT14|It's starting overseas.
NEUT15|Interesting, yeah, you know, it's funny to your right there for a second, we're the best performers.
NEUT16|Of course, over the month of November, and they were all energy related.
NEUT17|You mentioned Exxon Mobil.
BULL18|Briefly, we watched the stock maybe up a bit.
NEUT19|Jim, we've talked a lot about it.
NEUT20|This moving oil as well there, that there?
BEAR21|I mean, Occidental gotta downgrade today, there's Devin.
NEUT22|I mean, those moves were incredible.
BEAR23|Of course they were off lows that had not been seen for most of these stocks in ages, if.
NEUT24|Ever but an Exxon, you know, we've talked so often about it in terms of their capital allocation in terms of how much they're spending on exploration and on that dividend.
NEUT25|Any takeaways from this latest announcement?
BULL26|Look, you can cut back enough like they did, and I think that might make the dividend safe.
NEUT27|I think that ultimately there were some rig count went up again this week, and what happens in that camp goes up is that OPEC plus then decided you know what?
NEUT28|We're not going to make it even better for the Permian, but you know what, David?
NEUT29|I think more than.
NEUT30|Any other energy company.
NEUT31|The dividend is a religion at Exxon, and they'll do anything to preserve it.
NEUT32|And that's why when you see these right down so you don't get negativity, you get a sense that, wow, they threw the kitchen sink at it and we're fine.
NEUT33|When I look at stocks these days coral, I look at them for income and I look at them because I've kind of given up on the idea that the yield curve is going to move.
NEUT34|But especially when you hear what Chairman Powell saying I've been with Chairman Powell saying is look, I'm going to keep rates as long.
NEUT35|Low as long as possible, so everyone's looking for something.
NEUT36|Whether Bitcoin where they just got some capital appreciation?
NEUT37|Or will there be something like Exxon where it seems like the dividend might be safe despite what's going on?
NEUT38|So dividend and Bitcoin are the stories.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
