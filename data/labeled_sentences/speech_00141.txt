BULL0|"""Welcome to Sterling stocks."
NEUT1|Today I'm going to be talking to you about ticker symbol ONTX on Canova.
NEUT2|First off, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT3|This is not financial advice, so do what you will with this information.
NEUT4|I just kind of want to get into some chart stuff and kind of theory on.
NEUT5|While we seen a big spike as we as you all know we had this big spike right at Bell Slash after hours and then had a pretty nice opening as well today and then wrote it out when the whole market was pretty sketched out on what J PAL was going to say.
BULL6|So that's pretty promising.
BEAR7|We seem basically our average volume, so now that everyone's kind of surely settled after what he said.
NEUT8|We should be good to go and usually when you see this big spike up off, no news.
NEUT9|It is, uh, someone knows something that not everyone does, and they're really interested, you know, and so they're in the Roth conference right now.
NEUT10|And then they have these two more meetings that was also today and then tomorrow, so I'm sure they had a pretty solid one on one investment and somebody bought up a ton of shares would be my.
NEUT11|Inclination or they got it?
NEUT12|Some sort of true investment and other people got wind that they got this investment and loaded up some shares.
NEUT13|So if we go to the three month so we can just get look look at an overall trend of how it's looking.
NEUT14|C'mon c'mon.
BULL15|So as you can see, since the late December to the first of the year, it's really broken out of these top Bollinger bands quite a bit.
NEUT16|And as you can see here, we're making another break for it.
NEUT17|And as I said, there was not like much action.
BEAR18|Everyone was pretty sketched out and we've we've been on the way up and if we can add some good news and really pop, that will be good because if we need to avoid the RE split at all costs, but I don't see it happening because they really wanted to delay it to see how these meetings went and we're about to see a pretty good run up in my opinion.
BULL19|If if they got some good news from this conference which that little spike up afterwards, I think was a sign of things to come.
NEUT20|So I mean, yeah, not financial advice, but I think we're on the way up and it's going to be sooner than later, so don't miss out on on the rocket ship as they say.
NEUT21|Pretty sure you're looking at scribing it.
NEUT22|Super helps when channel get more views.
NEUT23|Trying to get this bad boy going.
NEUT24|Geez, can't with the slow computer though.
NEUT25|And wow, the.
NEUT26|That *****.
NEUT27|OK, here we go.
NEUT28|So as you can see.
NEUT29|Bum bum bum battlebus again that's on the six month so gives you a little better read.
BULL30|I think we're on our way up we're kind of trading over that moving average which I like to see bullish trend and this is very bullish to me.
NEUT31|Don't forget that big after Spike and then after our spike yesterday and then ran it on in today today when everyone was pretty sketched out.
NEUT32|Plus 14%.
BULL33|Not too bad.
BULL34|"So yeah, thank you all for watching like a scrub seal next time."""
