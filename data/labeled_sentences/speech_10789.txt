NEUT0|"""So Peter, one of the things I think our viewers, they're so excited they wanted a piece."
NEUT1|They bought Churchill when you try to figure out a price do you?
NEUT2|Did you say, listen, you know what were every bit as good as Tesla if not better, but were priced underneath Tesla?
BEAR3|So therefore anyone who thinks that this is over price is the stock is missing the big point.
NEUT4|Which is we have more technology.
BULL5|We have faster charging.
BULL6|We got a better car and were cheaper than the stock of Tesla.
BEAR7|Well, I think there's a gross misunderstanding of the markets actually Jim, because actually the price.
NEUT8|The acquisition price.
NEUT9|Of lucid from Churchill was $11.75 billion.
NEUT10|That was a snippet was a great deal for Churchill, but there was a quid pro quo.
BULL11|Churchill brought this incredible array of the bluest of blue chip companies to invest in us with long term commitment with a lock up and a commitment.
NEUT12|And those companies provided there was there, was that we were oversubscribed for the pipe.
NEUT13|So we actually.
NEUT14|Extended the fight and.
NEUT15|The pipe sold at $15 and this is unprecedented in the in the history of specs, so This is why I'm so Boyd that so many of these savvy investors.
NEUT16|Blue chip companies could see the long term value potential and that lies in lucid technology.
NEUT17|Yeah, and Peter.
NEUT18|I mean to that point you did sell 16% of the company to see Civ shareholders and to your point the pipe holders will own about 10%.
NEUT19|At 15, which is 50% more than those who invested originally in this packet, 10 have paid.
NEUT20|But that said you still sold 26% of the company at a discounted value.
NEUT21|When I say that I mentioned it because you might have just gone public the traditional way, there seemed to be great enthusiasm for your stock and your product.
NEUT22|Why did you still choose to go this way?
NEUT23|I think that this is people to us to secure our future we've raised over.
NEUT24|Four and a half billion dollars.
BULL25|This means that we can accelerate our business model and in a secure manner, and this is really important because the whole world needs to move to sustainable mobility with technology.
NEUT26|And this means that loose it can be at the forefront of this new movement.
NEUT27|The world cannot wait.
BULL28|This is given a security commitment from long term investors.
BULL29|And we've been.
BULL30|Augmented as a company by the illustrious roster of luminaries that Churchill capitalism has assembled, which provides a whole new dynamic and dimension as we grow the business going forward.
