NEUT1|What will happen tonight?
NEUT2|Tuesday, December 29th.
BULL3|NIO is one of the best performing stocks of 2020, which grew over 1000% in the last year.
BEAR4|However, recently Neo is down due to Alibaba's anti fraud investigation due to monopolistic practices in the company.
NEUT5|This leaves many investors worried on the future of the stock price, so watch to the end for my prediction.
NEUT6|Tuesday December 29th.
BEAR7|1st off a lot of comments said that I was wrong when I expected Neo to have a Green Day on Monday.
NEUT8|However, investors should not be worried.
BEAR9|Like explained by many analysts and me in previous videos, Neo has been down this past month purely because it's a Chinese company, not because of any fundamentals.
NEUT10|This is why when people claim the stock will go to zero, it makes zero sense.
BULL11|Now is still producing record breaking deliveries every single month.
NEUT12|They are planning to expand to Europe and at the same time they have no day approaching where they will release a new E7, a direct competitor to Tesla's model 3O150 kilowatt per hour.
BEAR13|Battery and rumors about them partnering with Apple.
NEUT14|As well as they will be building a new charging station every day in 2021.
BULL15|I stand behind my prediction that battery as a service will be a huge catalyst for the stock price due to their ability to offer their cars for even cheaper and then make recurring commissions.
NEUT16|As we all know, more and more business are transferring to subscription models as it is the most profitable and scalable.
BULL17|Now looking at today's premarket, it looks like Neo is currently 1.18% in green, meaning it is completely possible for it to gain back the 3.74% that it dropped yesterday.
BULL18|This is very good news and another big catalyst for the stock price also happened today.
BULL19|The House passed Donald Trump's $2000 stimulus bills, meaning the stock is expected to go even higher.
NEUT20|Now the part you all have been waiting for.
BEAR21|NIO stock price prediction for Tuesday December 29th, 2020 according to Sun Crest Banks Big Data stock analysis algorithmic system nyaho should bounce back at least 2% of what it dropped yesterday due to Alibaba's investigation for monopolistic practices.
NEUT22|Here is NIO stock projection by Sun Crest Bank, December 29th maximum price $53 median price.
NEUT23|$48.00 minimum price $45.00 December 30th maximum price $56 median price $49.00 minimum price $46.
BULL24|In summary, this algorithmic system and the basic Neo stock analysis indicate that NEO is expected to bounce back today and continue producing gains in the future.
BULL25|There is a good chance Neo will be green today.
NEUT26|I would give it an 80% chance.
BEAR27|Nio's recent drops are nothing to be worried.
NEUT28|Instead what I'm doing is recharging My Portfolio.
NEUT29|During the time I can buy Nio at a huge discount.
NEUT30|I think the Neo discount days are soon to be over, hold long and strong blue skies are coming.
BULL31|Thanks for watching.
