NEUT0|"""Age play in this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL2|Will a very impressive movement today on this one.
BULL3|Great way to start off the week.
NEUT4|So definitely updates are needed for scheduling.
NEUT5|Just go ahead and get rid of that line down there.
NEUT6|It served its purpose for now, but the first update that needs to be done come about based on a foundation rule in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed.
NEUT7|Above you want to see them act as support.
NEUT8|So on the newest areas of support moving forward now is right there at 123 fifty again was the resistance with the price above it you would want to see that that support actually played out perfectly already.
NEUT9|Once right there price bounce off it again right there.
NEUT10|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 123 fifty.
NEUT11|I'm not saying yeah, 123 fifty.
NEUT12|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL13|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|As far as areas of resistance are concerned, it's all about this red line which I've talked about in past videos that being defined as the $125 mark.
NEUT15|So we keep a close eye on that moving forward.
BEAR16|But All in all, fantastic movement, especially when you consider the volume analysis big solid volume on the move upwards, and then as the price just gone sideways here you can see volume has dropped off quite a bit.
NEUT17|Which is what you want to know as any textbook will tell you during those consolidation phases, you just want to see volume, kind of calm down, and that is exactly what's going on here.
NEUT18|And again, that doesn't mean that for sure this thing is going to blast up to 125 and above, but from a technical pattern perspective and from the volume analysis standpoint, it certainly is behaving just like you know a textbook would want to tell you that you would want to see it behave as, but overall great way to start the week.
NEUT19|Maybe that's the best news of everything that is only Monday.
NEUT20|So still four days left on the week.
NEUT21|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT22|Moving forward.
NEUT23|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT24|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT25|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL26|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT28|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT29|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR30|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT33|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT34|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT35|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT36|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT37|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT38|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
