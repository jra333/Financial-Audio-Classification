BULL0|"""Welcome back to market call."
NEUT1|I'm Paul Bagnell at our guest is Bruce Campbell of Stone Castle investment management.
NEUT2|We still have lots more time for your questions to Bruce in this segment.
NEUT3|However, we are going to deal with past picks and the first pass pick.
NEUT4|Bruce is next Leaf solutions at the ticker symbol OOLS on the Canadian Stock Exchange.
NEUT5|Recommended at $0.71.
NEUT6|Now trading at $0.32.
NEUT7|What are your thoughts on next Leaf where it sits right now?
BULL8|Yeah, so it's obviously sold off significantly with the overall cannabis sector over the last year, it's falls into the same category as valence, which we talked about earlier.
NEUT9|They were in the extraction technology side of things and the big thing that that next week's been doing is they've been built really building their facility over the last year.
NEUT10|Stock price was probably a little bit ahead of itself a year ago when we recommended it.
NEUT11|We thought they would be kind of up and running a little bit faster, but recently you know they've got their facility up and running.
BULL12|They've got a number of different patents, which is interesting for their technology, and now they're actually signing up clients, and they're going to be generating revenue here.
NEUT13|They just recently closed the financing, which probably had a bit of overhang on the stock is the stock was starting to really perk up here before that financing.
BULL14|It's one that we continue to own, and we think that you know it's probably a year and a half behind where balance was, but if you look at what happened with their numbers, they continue to ramp up after they started extraction, and now they're one of the most profitable, and we think that next week will be similar path.
NEUT15|You know, if you go out probably a year or 218 months in history.
NEUT16|OK, that is next.
NEUT17|"Leave next one green."""
