NEUT15|They want to be in smart cars, right?
NEUT16|Answer You would never.
NEUT17|You would never get on a hot.
NEUT18|I've already get it I don't want to ride around in a minute in a Mini Cooper know that it's too small I want to be in the biggest truck and then you if you are nothing right, nothing and so it's just to jump through them.

NEUT26|Now you're dealing with and there's some environmental issues too, so they had a case they had to settle with some environmental issues, but they have so many different SKUs there in so many different segments so that something can hit, but that one is going to be a little bit of a wait if you want to wait for a little bit of a turn around for that stock price.
