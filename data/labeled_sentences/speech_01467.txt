NEUT22|Those that's a tough pill live up to but my pick is magnite MGN I and a lot of you will probably unfamiliar with this name, but it was a merger between the Rubicon Project and tell area and it's starting to show synergies and the synergies are.
NEUT23|Happening to be paying off to shareholders, so at the open today, Angie and I was trading at 1898.
NEUT24|It's a little bit risky 'cause it's up over 100%, but Magna is the largest cell site advertiser and their clients are focused in the automotive, retail and technology sectors, and I truly believe if you want to ride the wave with me, this is not a Jim Cramer fan stock.
NEUT25|Whether it's not a Pinterest Motley Fool stock, so enjoy magnate Matt Night.
