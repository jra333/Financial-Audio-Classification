NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Also from disclosure standpoint, I do own Amazon from the long side in my retirement account, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
NEUT6|Well, quite the monster movement today and it was all about that last 30 minutes right there on Monday, so always makes him.
NEUT7|Did people know something that other people don't know?
BULL8|But regardless, that last 30 minutes surge definitely was a leading indicator of a very very impressive movement.
NEUT9|So moral.
NEUT10|The story here updates.
NEUT11|Definitely need to be done since the last video I did on Monday.
NEUT12|So the first thing to do is just move this green line up, yet still retains all the way down there, but it's just not relevant and from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT13|'cause there's lines that rare look.
NEUT14|So like I said, I'm just going to just level up.
BULL15|And now we have one of the newest areas of support and what I would call the ideal of a clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price can say about 3090.
BEAR16|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3090, that does not mean the entire charge destroyed or anything like that.
BULL17|But yeah, if the price could manage to stay above that area, that would be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT18|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT19|That is with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT21|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT22|Which is very very helpful, because when it comes to gauging the strength and health of the move from here all the way up to where it is her being defined as the move, just watch that Purple line.
NEUT23|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|Hiring must visualize that.
NEUT25|That is what has been represented.
NEUT26|Again, yes and both 39 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT27|It's all about that pink line going forward on my charge.
NEUT28|You know, it's a very well known and famous 200.
NEUT29|Moving average.
NEUT30|Currently valid at, let's just call it 3195 so keep an eye on those levels going forward.
BULL31|Be out on all very impressive movement today.
BULL32|Let's see if the price can continue to build upon this momentum.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT42|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live.
