NEUT0|"""Zach Estrada calling in from Houston, TX."
NEUT1|So I just want to know what are y'all's opinions on a T&T?
BEAR2|It's been around $30 and every time it gets above $30 it always drops.
NEUT3|I hear they're doing stuff with DIRECTV as far as selling it.
NEUT4|I heard it's in for the long run, but what do y'all think?
NEUT5|Do you think he could possibly get up to $60.00 a share?
NEUT6|Let me know.
NEUT7|Bonoan, what do you think?
NEUT8|FWF $60.00 a share.
NEUT9|I mean, Speaking of opinionated opinions, I do have one here.
NEUT10|I mean, this stock has been dead money for some time, hasn't really participated in the rally and ultimately I just don't think it's a winning business model to be purchasing assets at X.
NEUT11|Selling assets at fractions of X.
NEUT12|And that's currently the business model that they're undertaking.
NEUT13|So really, what I need to see is a consistent structure plan from management in terms of how they're going to right the ship here, particularly when you think about Netflix, Disney plus all the other streaming services.
NEUT14|I really I just got to see him right to ship here.
NEUT15|No, I'm not touching it.
NEUT16|Are you as downbeat Auntie guy as Bono and is?
NEUT17|We've been for a while.
NEUT18|They're getting a Clock cleaned by T-Mobile.
NEUT19|I mean, if you look John Ledger's just kicking everybody's rear end.
NEUT20|I mean they have balance sheet problems that we've talked about forever that you have the greatest stock market in the last six months in the history of mankind.
NEUT21|And the stock can't get over $30.
NEUT22|I mean, I, I take it to get the 32 befores 60 is pie in the Sky stuff.
NEUT23|My man, I dig Zach.
NEUT24|Love the name, Zach Mayo.
NEUT25|If you recall Mel, I know you do an officer and a gentleman, but I'm not digging AT&T right here.
NEUT26|I don't think I've ever seen that movie.
NEUT27|Dan, what do you say?
NEUT28|Baby Oh my God, sorry behind on movies in General, Dan.
NEUT29|You know, I like what these guys are doing here.
NEUT30|Anan Guy is right.
BEAR31|They do have a balance sheet problem.
NEUT32|They have a ton of debt and that's why they're looking to sell DIRECTV, even if it's lower than what they bought it for.
NEUT33|They're coming to the conclusion that that is not a business they want to be in.
NEUT34|So would you, rather than just kind of sit with it and let it bleed out?
NEUT35|I don't think so.
BULL36|So I think if they can sell that, pay down some debt, then you have a situation where this company, the valuation, can kind of expand a little bit.
NEUT37|They can focus on that Time Warner content integration.
NEUT38|Their delivery mechanisms that are working that are that is a utility and that's wireless.
NEUT39|And then the last point, I'll just make it pays a 7% dividend yield.
BULL40|So if you're looking at this stock at 29 and a half, and you don't think there's any risk to that dividend and you think of anything that they are able to pay down that debt with the DIRECTV, so I think the stock works higher.
BULL41|"I don't think it gets to your 60, but it could get back to 40 over the next year, so I think this is probably a pretty decent value play."""
