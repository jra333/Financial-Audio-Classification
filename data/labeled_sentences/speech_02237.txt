NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this."
NEUT1|Be a video chart on ticker symbol sesean.
NEUT2|I will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT4|By 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT6|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of Weakley one.
NEUT9|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price can now stay up there above 0017.
NEUT10|I don't get me wrong.
NEUT11|If the price falls below 117.
NEUT12|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage step above that level.
BULL13|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT18|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT19|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT20|Heard must visualize that.
NEUT21|That is what is being presented against your absolutely stand.
NEUT22|Above 117 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT23|As long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT24|First, the level to watch gonna be right here at.
NEUT25|002 and then, after 002, just simply where the party and momentum stop today.
NEUT26|And that was up there at 0024.
NEUT27|So keep running those couple levels moving forward.
NEUT28|But on all.
NEUT29|Anyway, look at it.
NEUT30|Great volume today, great price movement and not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum.
NEUT31|Moving forward.
NEUT32|Let's see what happens.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT35|But it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL37|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT42|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
