NEUT0|"""December the 2nd is in the books here on Wall Street."
NEUT1|Here's the New York minute.
BULL2|It's been a tough day for stock markets across the world, particularly tech stocks, but exciting one.
NEUT3|For bonds in particular, the 10 year Treasury yield here in the states you can see it nearly hit 2 1/2% yesterday and that it's come right back again today.
BEAR4|Such volatility shows great concern, but also suggests that it's too soon to declare that we are definitively in a GNU upward trend yields.
BEAR5|Now the big news today was on unemployment.
BEAR6|Here in the states, if you take a look at the unemployment rate, it's down to 4.6 its lowest since before the crisis, and lower than it was for most of George W. Bush's presidency.
BULL7|If you're wondering why the Democrats failed to get much political credit for it, signal average hourly earnings growth, it's now it's still above 2%, but not very strong at all.
NEUT8|Showing that living standards still aren't rising much for those in work.
NEUT9|The bottom line, as far as the market is concerned, is that this is all consistent with the Fed recent rates, but only doing so slowly, not much inflation.
NEUT10|That's the bottom line.
NEUT11|"And that's the New York minute."""
