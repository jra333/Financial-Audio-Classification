BULL0|"""Thank you very much Dominic."
BULL1|And Speaking of movers, Disney shares having a huge run up in the past year or 30% in that time period.
NEUT2|Has the stock run its course or is there still more room to the upside little fashion Stock Brawl on Disney today for a magical bro, we got Robert Luna from sure Vest Wealth Management.
NEUT3|He's our bull on this and David Trainer from new constructs is our bear David it's UN American to be bearish on Disney.
NEUT4|I thought, you know, I realize that it's still a great company, is just not the best stock right now.
NEUT5|I'd never say anything bad about Disney is a business though.
NEUT6|Simply just too expensive.
NEUT7|Is that what you think?
NEUT8|Yeah, that's right.
NEUT9|It's priced for perfection.
BULL10|They've got a great pipeline, but it's all priced in.
BULL11|I mean, the valuation implies the company is going to grow profits and revenues at over 6 1/2% for 40 years, so I'd say that's probably a pretty good run and we live in a world where there's a lot more competition for Disney and they can only recycle Star Wars and Avengers for so long, right?
NEUT12|We haven't seen a Mickey Mouse movie in awhile, right?
BULL13|'cause some things just get old and I look, I think they've done a great job.
BULL14|The pipeline looks good and the stock accurately reflects everything.
NEUT15|What do you think Robertini?
NEUT16|It is just looking at the analyst estimates here.
NEUT17|Five and a half dollars in earnings.
NEUT18|It's trading at 100 and that's for the September of next year.
NEUT19|It's trading at 108.
NEUT20|You know?
NEUT21|It's certainly not cheap.
BULL22|Yeah, I mean well, if you look at next year's earnings Kelly, I think the stock easily could hit above $6 a share.
NEUT23|And if you look at historical multiple on the stock, that puts Disney in about 100 and 22125.
NEUT24|I mean, I, I get the downgrade to neutral.
NEUT25|I mean, they're not.
NEUT26|They're not saying sell.
NEUT27|This is the first time.
BULL28|Honestly, in the last three years that my 12 month target hasn't exceeded 20%, we're looking at about a 14 to 15% upside over 12 months.
NEUT29|But you know, if you look at the S&P where that's value.
NEUT30|I mean, if you're getting ready to sell Disney here, you might as well be selling the whole market.
BULL31|This is a best in breed company and it's been mentioned they have a very robust pipeline.
NEUT32|You know this year they're putting the 60th anniversary at Disney Parks in California.
NEUT33|That's going to drive record attendance.
NEUT34|They got Lucas coming up in December.
NEUT35|Let's not forget Shanghai's opening January February of next year, so there's a lot of good things about Disney and even at the shareholder Holder meeting, they announced a frozen Part 2 so I don't think it's time to let this one go.
NEUT36|What about that David, I mean?
NEUT37|Bob Eiger is celebrating his 10th anniversary as CEO.
NEUT38|I mean, we all agree he's done a masterful job of assembling these different parts and pieces that are in that pipeline that you acknowledge is pretty strong right now, don't you think he's got some up up something else up his sleeve?
NEUT39|At this point, you know, I think I think the point that look if you're if you're looking at Disney and you're thinking of cell there, you might want to think about selling the whole market.
NEUT40|I think this there's a fair point to that, right?
NEUT41|I mean, the idea is that it's fully fully valued and most people leave the markets fairly valued now.
NEUT42|I think when it comes to picking stocks.
NEUT43|Hey, if you're going to put your money into something, put in something that's attractively valued, some of its cheap, not something that's fully guide, and I think that's the distinction here.
BULL44|This is a great company Robert.
NEUT45|Let me if I just tried to pick up at Disney's business for a second.
NEUT46|Do this.
NEUT47|You could argue ESPN all right, we've got a bunch of things happening with the television business changing theme parks everytime measles comes up.
BEAR48|People maybe get a little scared off.
NEUT49|I mean, there are perhaps some of these concerns.
BEAR50|Could cloud the stock for a time.
NEUT51|Yeah, I mean.
BEAR52|Absolutely short term, you could see a 510% pullback.
BULL53|That's an opportunity.
NEUT54|I was at Disneyland Saturday.
NEUT55|Kelly, it was packed.
BEAR56|Measles wasn't an issue and I think time and time again people have had a bearish case on Disney for the last.
NEUT57|You know, two and a half, three years at the every time it gets to these valuations but they continue to exceed expectations.
NEUT58|I would stay with the stock.
NEUT59|All right gentlemen.
BULL60|Thank you both.
BULL61|Appreciate it very much.
NEUT62|"Robert Luna and David Tran."""
