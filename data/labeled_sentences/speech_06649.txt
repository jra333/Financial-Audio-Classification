NEUT2|Today we will look at LB all on the daily chart.
BEAR3|Gbpusd has been making lower lows and lower highs since declining from June of this year, falling from a peak of one point 5929.
BEAR4|The market is below its daily Chimacum cloud also below the 200 day moving average.
BEAR5|Ann, these highlight the bearish market structure, also the negatively aligned tenkan Sen and Kijun Sen lines are adding to the downside bias.
BEAR6|The July 2013 low one point 4811 is the next target to the downside, but with this stochastic reaching oversold levels and the RSI also approaching oversold levels, we could expect a pause in the decline.
BEAR7|Any bounces to the upside would find resistance level at the Tenkan Sen line.
NEUT8|Which comes in at one point 5050.
BULL9|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
