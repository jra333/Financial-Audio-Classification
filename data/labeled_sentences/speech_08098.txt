NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Bill Nygren."
NEUT1|He manages the oakmark fund.
NEUT2|He joins us as he always does from Chicago.
BULL3|Nice to see you happy New year.
BULL4|Welcome back.
BULL5|Thank you happy New year to you as well.
NEUT6|Thank you.
NEUT7|Appreciate that.
NEUT8|Alright, let's talk.
NEUT9|Let's go for some of these new buys.
NEUT10|I want to get right into it.
NEUT11|KKR.
NEUT12|Number one tell me why?
NEUT13|Sure, if you just look at the surface multiple.
NEUT14|On KKR it looks like it's selling at roughly a market multiple, which is a little premium to the other asset managers.
BULL15|And you'd probably say that looks appropriate because KKR has been getting such good inflows compared to traditional managers, which are generally suffering outflows.
NEUT16|The thing that Mrs. Is there's about $16.00 per share, and KKR sells at about $40 a share.
NEUT17|So $16.00 a share of value in.
NEUT18|Assets that are invested in KKR's own products.
BEAR19|So we look at that and say we're only paying $24.00 for the business that earning about $2.00, so that drops the multiple to about 12 times earnings for Premier asset Manager.
BULL20|That's got better than industry growth.
BULL21|We think that's pretty attractive.
NEUT22|So apparently does the street.
BULL23|The stock is getting to move on that up to percent alright.
NEUT24|Fiserve why this one sure fiserve again.
NEUT25|The story is the headline multiple looks about like a market multiple somewhere around 20 times earnings.
NEUT26|But if you look out just a couple of years and give them full credit for the synergies that they expect an expense savings that they'll record from the first data acquisition that multiple falls from about 20 times down to 16, and then further there's a business inside of fiserve that accounts for less than 5% of its revenues Clover, that has a lot of similarities to the business square and square trades in the public markets for more than all of fiserve's market cap.
NEUT27|And Clover actually processes more volume than Square does, so we think there's an important hidden asset in there in addition to a company that is cheap.
BULL28|"If you account for the cost savings that they're likely to record in just the next couple of years."""
