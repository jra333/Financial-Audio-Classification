NEUT0|"""Let's talk about crew Ted."
NEUT1|We're about $68.
NEUT2|You say there's key support at 6570.
NEUT3|Resisted 68 Resistance 73.
NEUT4|Where are we heading?
NEUT5|Yeah, that's a great question.
NEUT6|You know.
BEAR7|Yesterday it really kind of looked like we were rolling over to the downside under more pressure on the idea that global demand destruction is occurring.
BULL8|Right now we're watching the dollar gets stronger that's causing issues, but yesterday's reversal off of key support, I mean, longer term trendline support was really pretty interesting and supportive.
BEAR9|Now we're running into resistance again in a big cluster of moving averages.
NEUT10|Like you said right here at the $68 mark.
BULL11|But if we can get through that, we might go up and test those recent highs.
BEAR12|Overall, the fundamentals are getting a little bit more negative.
NEUT13|I'm not terribly negative crude oil, but.
BULL14|I do think we could roll over and see a bigger correction.
BULL15|I think yesterday's bounce off a key support was just the first time we were testing that support.
NEUT16|I'm looking for a bit more downside, but fairly limited in nature.
NEUT17|Ted, what sort of moves can we expect to see in the dollar?
NEUT18|It's it's move upwards stopping today, but you know, it's pretty close to that 1213 month high.
NEUT19|If you look at the Dollar spot index, what's next for the dollar?
NEUT20|Yes.
NEUT21|Well, you're right.
BULL22|I mean, so we are close to that 1213 month high.
NEUT23|So that is very key.
BEAR24|Psychological resistance were also really overbought.
BEAR25|In the dollar were over 70% in the in the relative strength index, we don't usually stay above 70% in most markets and less there is sort of a parabolic move in this fund, something extremely surprising fundamentally driving that we don't really have that in the dollar, so I think we find some resistance here.
BULL26|I think we can see a bit of a pullback.
BEAR27|I don't think it's going to be a major pullback.
NEUT28|We're in an upward trend channel where at the high end of that trend channel right now.
NEUT29|I'm thinking maybe 402 to 400 point pullback.
NEUT30|Test the bottom end of that trend channel and then continue upwards.
BULL31|I think overall the fundamentals for the dollar are really rather strong.
NEUT32|You look at all the other currencies in the world, not all of them, but a lot of other currencies in the world.
BEAR33|Losing strength.
NEUT34|I mean, we've been talking a lot about the euro with with Italy we've been talking about rupee in India and Lira in Turkey.
BEAR35|These are things that are having sort of temporary relief bounces because they've gotten very oversold.
BEAR36|Dollar again, very overbought could see a correction.
BULL37|But again, longer term I'm still looking for upside potential.
NEUT38|So it's really interesting that they're talking about this, because yes, Bitcoin is getting crushed.
BEAR39|Yes, other currencies are getting crushed, but he makes a great point where it's getting more and more overbought.
BEAR40|The dollar, so this dip for crypto could continue for a little bit longer, especially if you're comparing or Bitcoin chart.
NEUT41|In the US dollar, which is right now, the King of all currencies.
NEUT42|But this trend can't last forever, and you know, he says that the fundamentals are strong for dollar, where I am going to say it's the contrary, I mean.
BEAR43|The dollar is going to have to get weaker.
NEUT44|We are loading so much debt with interest rates going up and eventually this is going to stop an let's just be honest or President Trump make America great.
NEUT45|Love him.
NEUT46|Well kind of.
NEUT47|But anyways, he's really just doing this short term.
NEUT48|He's just loading up debt and making and even this trade war stuff.
NEUT49|It's all just short term which is going to help him get elected for 2020.
NEUT50|But long term this is going to fail and that's the biggest issues you know can you can you hold?
NEUT51|Can you wait for?
BEAR52|The trend to reverse because this trend might continue for another three months, another six months, but eventually it's going to have to correct.
BULL53|And when it does, that's where I see crypto and other currencies rebounding.
NEUT54|"But let me know your thoughts and I will talk to you soon."""
