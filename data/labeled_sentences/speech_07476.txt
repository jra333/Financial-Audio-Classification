NEUT1|Here's a valuation I did on Facebook Inc. Ticker symbol FB currently trading around $274.00 per share.
NEUT2|The reason I wanted to take a look at them was I've been watching him for a while and I kind of missed an opportunity to buy when they were a lot lower.
NEUT3|So I wanted to see if maybe there was any value left or if they are.
NEUT4|Overpriced.
BULL5|Also, I think they got a lot of investment in future tech.
NEUT6|That's going to be really big, like AI VR and that FaceTime thing they have.
NEUT7|Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if you see a lot higher adoption and baby boomers on that technology.
BULL8|And then it's just going to put them in a great position.
NEUT9|First thing I like to take a look at is their earnings per share trend.
NEUT10|I'm looking for it to be in the positive and trending upward quarter after quarter.
NEUT11|This is a great example.
BULL12|This looks perfect, positive and trending upwards nicely.
NEUT13|I estimated their intrinsic value using a Benjamin Graham model with $10.09 earnings over last 12 months and a growth rate at 2150.
NEUT14|Conservatively, they're worth $98 a share more aggressively.
NEUT15|$623.00 per share.
NEUT16|So 274 is kind of.
NEUT17|On the low end of the middle range there.
NEUT18|So I would say overall it seems like pretty fair price.
NEUT19|Morningstar estimates their fair value at $335 per share.
NEUT20|I went ahead and did a fundamental analysis based on their recent 10K filing from January 2021.
NEUT21|One thing I liked about their fundamentals was a lot of year over year growth and key earnings metrics.
BEAR22|The biggest concern I have is their intrinsic value looks way overvalued compared to their market price.
BEAR23|The risk looked alright, so really it's just the market price trend showing they're overvalued and the stock price is possibly in a mini bubble.
NEUT24|But like I said, I missed out before then.
BULL25|There's definitely potential.
BEAR26|They could continue to run up given all the investments they have in future technologies that could pay off.
BULL27|Thanks for watching.
BULL28|"May you be blessed."""
