NEUT0|"""Of course, the process of bankruptcy is messy."
NEUT1|The bondholders often don't know where they stand.
NEUT2|You'll have senior bondholders, junior bottle, or sometimes Sir senior mortgage banker bondholders.
NEUT3|They all have a chance of getting a piece of new post bankruptcy hurts because it's highly unlikely that the business actually goes away.
NEUT4|The enterprise is more something.
BEAR5|The problem is that the common stock holders are at the bottom of the bankruptcy pecking order, meaning there's almost zero chance they get a piece of the new company.
NEUT6|If you own hurts here, 4 bucks, you're buying the old hurts with 19 billion in debt.
NEUT7|That it can't repay, since the creditors can't collect, they're going to seize the collateral, which is the business.
NEUT8|So this $4 stock will most likely just be cancelled.
BEAR9|Honestly, the fact that hasn't been cancelled yet is a travesty, because it's only a matter of time.
NEUT10|If I were running the bankruptcy court issue, an edict saying the darn thing can trade, which would keep inexperienced investors from losing money on it.
NEUT11|Instead, this darn thing traded 5 or 30 million shares yesterday in 295 million today.
NEUT12|The whole float is only 140,000,000.
NEUT13|That's insane, and it's not just hurts we're seeing the same thing with Chesapeake Energy.
BEAR14|The heavily indebted oil and gas producer.
BEAR15|Chester is headed for bankruptcy because it can't cover its interest.
NEUT16|Payments to bondholders will repossess the company taking away the common stock from shareholders.
NEUT17|The same way hurts is being repossessed the same way your house or your car would be repossessed.
