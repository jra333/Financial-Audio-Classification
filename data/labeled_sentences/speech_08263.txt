NEUT0|"""This is a name that we like from mathematic perspective."
NEUT1|We didn't get there in time by moving into an active idea.
NEUT2|I don't feel terrible about that just because we did a lot of thematic work to justify the view heading in.
BULL3|But even with the stock up here, I think that there's potential that this thing can continue to run early, show extreme relative strengths.
BULL4|Just given that you know the rise and with cord cutting, you know we saw a significant acceleration in the decline in people cutting the cord in Q1 of 19 versus 2018.
NEUT5|And as that continues to accelerate, and as more time goes to streaming, eventually ad dollars are going to follow and so basically this is the chart that is the bull case on Roku, and it's still very early days.
NEUT6|Meanwhile they have, you know the largest share of streaming devices out there at 28% more so than you know the Amazon Firestick which I know that there's a debate out there in terms of active users, but it's hard to really figure out.
NEUT7|You know what Amazon's definition of that?
NEUT8|Active user metric is relative to Roku and then the last point I'll make is you know why do you.
NEUT9|Why do I like Roku?
NEUT10|You know and not.
NEUT11|Netflix is because Netflix is reaching the end of its.
NEUT12|I think of its growth life cycle.
BULL13|I think it's turning into a value.
BEAR14|Company's growth slows.
NEUT15|Roku wins any Roku wins either way, because if you lose growing at a fast clip and Netflix is slowing vice versa.
NEUT16|There diversified platform based on ad dollars, so I think it's you know everything.
BULL17|"All things considered, it's positive."""
