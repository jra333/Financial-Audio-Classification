NEUT0|"""Yes, Sir, you already notice you would behave we back with another one."
NEUT1|That's going to get right into it.
NEUT2|No one like waste nobody time before we do that, let's get this video.
BULL3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people.
NEUT4|They wouldn't be touching base on organic gram.
NEUT5|Let's take a symbol OG I we're going to be doing a brief summary.
NEUT6|Quick update.
NEUT7|We're not gonna put nothing on the screen 'cause we talked about this stop multiple times on the channel.
NEUT8|So we just gonna be doing giving out some reassurance, letting y'all know what this stock is headed for.
NEUT9|The short term long term knowing what I knew.
NEUT10|Support and I knew resistant points are.
NEUT11|So it's going to get right into it.
NEUT12|Yeah, so organigrama time this recording we train at about $3.83.
NEUT13|The open was 399, the high was four seats.
BEAR14|The low was 381.
NEUT15|The 52 week high was 6:45 to 52 week low was 101.
NEUT16|So if we go ahead and take a look at our chart guys, we right here at the silent support right where we at now.
NEUT17|If we don't bounce out this three 8384 range is 383 seventy.
NEUT18|The high three 70s in the low three 80s.
NEUT19|We don't bounce off their support and start an eyesore, retreating from here, we could possibly we could possibly see.
NEUT20|Where need support line is?
NEUT21|We could possibly see the low three 60s around 3:50 and if we don't hold 353 sixty we could see the low threes around 3:00 or 4.
NEUT22|In and then, if you don't hold that three or four, the Lord she going to see is around 286.
NEUT23|I don't expect this time to go no lower than that.
NEUT24|I doubt we'll see those prices, but I always want to have your prepared for worst possible.
BULL25|So let's carry on you guys now let's see why resistant point at we know previously we had a resistance around 4:18 once we broke their 418, we posed a flew straight up to $6.
NEUT26|But you know you know how I know the style market is not one reward or so.
NEUT27|Easily Nanny 9990 to 99% of people in the stock market loses money, so it's not going to be your Peaches and cream easy ride you gonna have to hold your shares.
NEUT28|Hold on for the long haul because if you went in just to meet.
NEUT29|Quick money he was not going to last very long.
NEUT30|You're going to have to have patience and discipline and a whole lot more that we go over on the channel on the daily.
NEUT31|So let's go ahead and check it out.
BEAR32|Yeah, now I knew resistance point is around $4.02.
BULL33|Once we get back up in this upward momentum.
NEUT34|This all return.
BULL35|We need a Birdie 402 before we could see a nice upward push.
NEUT36|Once we break that resistance around four or two, we got another resistance around 444.
BEAR37|Once we broke 418 the last time, that's where we stopped in our tracks around $4.44.
BULL38|Once you break their 402, we need to get better at 444 quickly and once we reached at 444, this tank of fly straight to the fives and straight to the sixes or previously Woods on February the 10th at $6 would retest that from $6.
NEUT39|This thing can go high, so most definitely OG Organigram is bullish.
BULL40|We still bullish.
NEUT41|They trying to shake the weekend they trying to shake the tree.
NEUT42|In the marijuana sector right now.
NEUT43|So just hold on guys.
NEUT44|Hold on for the ride and like I see always if you got Cody and at the top if you bought too high you can always sell half your position.
NEUT45|75% of your position and buy back in towards the low threes, the mid threes or as it's falling down you can you want to bring your average costs down, so that's another word of advice for you guys.
NEUT46|And that's all.
NEUT47|That's all I really got for you guys.
NEUT48|This video I just want to bring out the quick update give you all some reassurance on OG.
NEUT49|I let you know that we still bullish on it and give you a quick update.
