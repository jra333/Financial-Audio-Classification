NEUT0|"""So today my group and I are going to present a leadership analysis on Warren Buffett."
NEUT1|Warren Buffett is an is an American business magnate in investor and philanthropist who is also the Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT2|Our project aims to explain how he could be a successful leader by analyzing his leadership behavior in terms of threat, approach, behavioral approach in situational approach.
NEUT3|He was born in.
NEUT4|Omaha, NE on August 30th, 1930.
NEUT5|He he bought his first stock at age 11.
NEUT6|He went to University of Pennsylvania and transferred to University of Nebraska, Lincoln and graduated with Masters from Columbia University.
NEUT7|He married Susan Thompson Buffett and had three kids with her and then married Astrid Maxon.
NEUT8|In 2006.
NEUT9|His net worth is 82 point.
NEUT10|Billion U.S. dollars?
NEUT11|S for 2020.
NEUT12|His personality type piece.
NEUT13|I TJ through the inspectors are showing sturdy torrented present focused, observant, and their weaknesses are typically judgmental, subjective and they have tendency to blame others.
NEUT14|Some of the trades that he's been described.
NEUT15|He's been described as frugal.
NEUT16|He's also been described as greedy, but people call him cheerfully greedy, and he's also big on independent thought.
NEUT17|He never really follows the trends.
NEUT18|Which contributes to his success.
BULL19|I was able now, says Warren Buffett is obviously free spirited leader.
NEUT20|He is our relationship oriented.
NEUT21|He lets his own employees have the free will to do what they need to do without him having to hover over them.
NEUT22|He is a transformation, a leader.
NEUT23|He likes to let his employees.
NEUT24|Follow principles of behavior instead of rules and he is a person who looks at the glass half full rather than half empty, and he deeply believes in integrity.
NEUT25|Moving on to situational analysis, Buffett has employed a laissez-faire or freirean approach to managing his company.
NEUT26|A lot of freedom is given to employees to make the right decision or what they're going to do.
NEUT27|Buffett employs a hands off management style because he knows that people perform best when given autonomy.
NEUT28|So is he successful or unsuccessful?
BULL29|I would definitely say, or we as a group definitely say that he is a successful leader.
NEUT30|Some suggestions or recommendations that we would give him is to be a little less greedy.
NEUT31|He can be cheerfully greedy as said before, but he would be more successful if he was less greedy and would stay within his ethical perspectives.
NEUT32|When investing.
