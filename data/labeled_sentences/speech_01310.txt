NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Katrina and I'm the social media manager here at The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|We're here to answer your investing questions and I've got a batch in from Facebook and Twitter.
NEUT2|I'm going to send them down to our analysts who answer them with their foolish opinions.
NEUT3|Pat on Facebook, asks asset allocation, how much of My Portfolio should be in stocks?
NEUT4|How much in fixed income, etc.
NEUT5|It's a good question, Pat.
NEUT6|I'll give you one rule of thumb, will start and will work off of that.
NEUT7|One rule of thumb is that you have a percentage of your portfolio in bonds that is equal to your age.
NEUT8|So if you are 60 years old.
NEUT9|60% of your portfolio should be in bonds.
NEUT10|It's a pretty conservative rule of thumb, but it's one that is often recommended as a starting point.
NEUT11|I know that it is recommended a lot by someone like John John Bogle, who is the founder of Vanguard Funds, and he actually lives this.
NEUT12|So he's about 81 now and 81% of his portfolio is in bonds, but he's an interesting example because as the founder of Vanguard Funds, he probably has a significant amount of money, so he actually doesn't have to take too much risk.
NEUT13|So one answer to your question is how much risk do you need to take if to accomplish your goals.
NEUT14|You only need two or three percent.
NEUT15|A return on your portfolio.
NEUT16|Then you can have a significant amount of your portfolio in bonds and not have to take the extra risk.
NEUT17|Another rule of thumb is that people who are close to or in retirement should have about 50 to 60% of their money in bonds.
NEUT18|Why should you still have some money in stocks?
NEUT19|Well, if you retire at 65 you should expect to live until maybe 90 or so most people want, but you should factor that into your plan, 'cause it's certainly possible and with that long of an investment timeframe, you're talking 2025 years, even if you're already retired, you should still have a significant.
NEUT20|Part of your portfolio in stocks because over the long term stocks beat bonds but also your retirement income has to keep up with inflation.
NEUT21|So you should always have some stocks.
BEAR22|Now if you're younger, the question really is about your risk tolerance and you look back to maybe 2008 when the stock market dropped 37%.
NEUT23|What did you do?
NEUT24|Did you panic and sell at the bottom, or did you use that opportunity to buy more stocks?
NEUT25|If you panicked because the market dropped 30% thirty 7%, that means that maybe you're a little more conservative investor.
NEUT26|So in that case you should probably have maybe ten 2030% of your portfolio in bonds.
NEUT27|If you did not panic if you saw it as a buying opportunity, then you're a little more aggressive.
NEUT28|You're more risk tolerant.
NEUT29|In that case, you may not need to move into any bonds until you are maybe 5060 years old, or at least within a decade of retirement.
NEUT30|And now we want to hear from you.
