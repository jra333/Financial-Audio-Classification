NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Wednesday, January 18th, I'm wrapping by John, Currency analyst and xm.com, and today we're going to look at the British pound versus the Japanese yen."
BEAR1|Pound yen has been on a steady downtrend since mid December when it reached a post Brexit high.
BEAR2|The decline has shifted the near term bias to negative as prices have slipped below the moving averages and into the ichimoku cloud.
NEUT3|Looking at ichimoku analysis, the Purple Red kitchen purple Tank Hansen Line has recently crossed below the Blue kitchen sandline.
NEUT4|This alignment is a very short term signal.
BEAR5|D RSI is also bearish below 15.
BEAR6|Yesterday's attempt to break above the cloud failed as prices met resistance at the top of the cloud at around 114.
BEAR7|There is further resistance today at around that level, this time from the Tenkan Sen Line.
BEAR8|If the downside momentum holds, prices would likely find support at the bottom of the cloud at 135 a drop below the cloud would only strengthen the negative momentum.
BULL9|To the upside, a successful break above the 140 area and above the cloud Top brings interview the 141 level, which is where the 200 day moving average is currently at.
BULL10|The 50 day moving average is not too far up at 141.84.
BULL11|Under pair would need to overcome this level for more convincing signal of a reversal in the short term, negative bias.
BULL12|However, the longer term picture remains unclear as a rally at the end of 2016 produces only a neutral outlook at best, and prices would need to beat the December high 148.44 to resume the uptrend.
BULL13|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
