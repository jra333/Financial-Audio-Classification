NEUT0|"""Nicole and I just spent two hours on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right behind us covering the Uber IPO."
NEUT1|Nicole opened up at 42.
BEAR2|The IPO price is 45 not auspicious start for Uber now.
BEAR3|We were talking to some of the market makers inside and they were arguing.
BEAR4|Look, it's been a down market all week is bad market today, so they said they're not necessarily upset with the outcome.
NEUT5|But I gotta say this comes a couple months after lift.
BEAR6|There seems to be sentiment turning against some of these ride hailing apps.
NEUT7|What's your takeaway from today's action?
BEAR8|People are excited about this latest round of tech visionaries, disrupting everything from the way we communicate the way we get around the way we travel around the world.
NEUT9|They're excited about it, but not euphoric, so that's sort of the nuances here compared to some previous generations of tech companies that have gone public to just absolutely insane amount of euphoria.
NEUT10|Another thing that's going on now is investors are really looking for companies to have a pathway to profitability.
NEUT11|They don't necessarily have to be profitable now.
NEUT12|In fact, lift is not profitable.
NEUT13|Uber is not profitable, but investors need to get comfortable around the story around the trajectory to profitability pathway.
NEUT14|It's interesting, this was the largest tech IPO I guess in seven years, right?
NEUT15|Facebook was the biggest one.
NEUT16|In 2012 we've had a whole spate of them.
BEAR17|Now we've had left as you said, printer S. We have a slack coming up.
NEUT18|Why do we think that everyone's now come to market now?
NEUT19|Is there anything that tells us about the froth in the market or sentiment market?
NEUT20|Why do we think everything is happening now?
BULL21|This generation of tech companies out of Silicon Valley has stayed private, much longer than we've seen historically, so they've been able to grow to these very, very large sizes through private funding.
NEUT22|And that's because the private market, the pool of money available for private investing is just much larger than it has been in the past, so there's a couple of different theories about why now.
NEUT23|Which is, you know, the big question one is that we are in the very late stages of a very.
NEUT24|Decade Long Bull Run, but it was like time's running out.
NEUT25|But I think people are aware that we are getting to the late stages of it.
NEUT26|Another thing that sources have been telling us is next year 2020 is a potentially contentious presidential election, so perhaps companies are thinking may and their bankers might be advising them.
NEUT27|Let's get this done and dusted before we have this very high level of uncertainty that could potentially come into the market.
NEUT28|Right?
NEUT29|Last question just again some color from the floor and I know it's day once it's hard to draw any conclusions.
NEUT30|But as we were standing there, we saw the guidance go from 40 to 48th and then lower and lower and lower and user I sort of turned each other says gosh, you could feel the air just seeping out of the room.
NEUT31|Does the fact that Uber is opening lower the IPO price followed following the lift sort of going haywire and their their IPO?
NEUT32|Do you think that's going to affect decision making going forward?
NEUT33|Whether some of these IPO these tech companies that were thinking about going public may now stop?
NEUT34|Or is it too early to to call that?
NEUT35|I think it's too early to call because will have to see what happens over the next couple of months.
NEUT36|It is day one.
BEAR37|It was a down day.
NEUT38|But certainly you do not want to open below your offering price, it's more about.
NEUT39|A good signal of what the investor mindset is that the companies that come now may not.
NEUT40|It may not change anybody's decision to come, but after lift, the word around Huber was that they were going to be much more conservative.
NEUT41|They were not going to push it to the bitter limit an you know take as much as they could in the IPO.
NEUT42|And so I think that's what you'll see going forward is that companies will be mindful that investors are being very discerning and they have to take that into account.
BULL43|Thank you Nicole Serena Cole's coverage of the IPO surge of the last few months.
