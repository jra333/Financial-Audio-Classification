NEUT0|"""But you were just talking about times when it's OK to sell."
BULL1|If you've had gains on some of these big cap tech names.
NEUT2|Yeah, I'm not advocating that this is a get out now moment.
BULL3|I just think that we've had such a good run.
NEUT4|There was something that came out on the screen this morning that we are having the best quarter since the fourth quarter of 1999 and I just can't be.
NEUT5|Oh well, So what?
NEUT6|That's one was that it's that was a Seminole top.
BULL7|There's been some fantastic runs.
NEUT8|And I think that sometimes we forget why we own stocks.
NEUT9|We own stocks to create.
NEUT10|Well, there was a gentleman one just now Mr. Baylon.
NEUT11|And he made so many good points, agrees with me on selling the ones that are really selling some of the ones that have really moved.
NEUT12|He would like to rotate into what the stocks that haven't moved yet.
NEUT13|What I am saying is, you know what?
NEUT14|There's no sense for a lot of our investors who watched a rotating something has to move when they can just sit and wait with some cash which is.
NEUT15|Cash has been so vilified an I think that I am not coming in early like some of the people I don't need to go over their names anymore because they happen to be some very good investors, but I am not coming in and saying get out when they did they missed a huge move.
BULL16|One of the greatest movies in my lifetime.
NEUT17|It could still go on.
NEUT18|I did a piece last night saying with Larry Williams saying the best actual day of the year is the day before July 4th.
NEUT19|But I do feel that it is not a shocking thing to say.
NEUT20|There's so many signs that we're getting, why not obey some of them an go and take a little off.
NEUT21|"And maybe you can say you know what I took some off before something bad happened."""
