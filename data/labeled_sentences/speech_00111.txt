NEUT0|"""So what happened to Visa?"
BEAR1|The stock market was broadly lower on Wednesday morning, with all three major averages down by nearly 3% as of 10:45.
BEAR2|AM visa ticker symbol V was having a particularly rough day down more than 5%.
BULL3|Typically visa is less volatile than most other fintech stocks and it also has held up much better than most of the financial sector during the COVID-19 pandemic.
NEUT4|Additionally, Visa actually reports its earnings after today's trading session.
NEUT5|So it may seem odd that it's following so much.
NEUT6|There are two likely reasons for today's move.
NEUT7|First, and most obviously is the general market selling pressure.
BEAR8|It's fair to say that a 3% decline in the S&P 500 is likely weighing on Visa's stock price.
NEUT9|Second, Visa announced that it has agreed to acquire Fintech Yellow Pepper.
NEUT10|The deal is at an undisclosed price, but given the prices of recent vintage deals such as Paypal's $4 billion acquisition of Honey, the valuation is likely rather high.
NEUT11|It's not uncommon for the acquirer to take a hit in these situations, and that could explain some of these is declined today since we don't know the financial details of the Yellow Pepper acquisition.
BULL12|It's tough to analyze whether it's a smart move by Visa, however the company has some proprietary technology that Visa could potentially implement throughout its vast network, giving the company an advantage over rivals.
NEUT13|"Since visa reports earnings after today's close, it could be worth watching to see if the company offers any further detail or commentary about this transaction."""
