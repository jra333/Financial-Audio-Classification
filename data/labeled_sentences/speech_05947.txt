NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Guys go to your tactical traders.
NEUT2|I just want to go vertical symbol SHOP and that's Shopify.
BULL3|So earlier today it opened up around 1072, sixty one in which case it decided to go up to around 1080 to create the intraday high for the day.
NEUT4|Within the 1st 20 minutes.
BEAR5|Now it did drop below the 50 SN may on the one minute chart.
NEUT6|Nothing too crazy here but it did go flat for.
BULL7|Least 10 minutes, and that was a pretty good sign to let me know that the Bears weren't really going to try to push it down any farther than it already has been an.
NEUT8|It might be a little bit safer to buy in around 1075 to 1080 with a potential breakout about 1085.
NEUT9|I did want to have a. I did have a 1100 price target and that's just to give me something to shoot for, but when Shopify starts to move, it really starts to move in a big way and it really.
BEAR10|Started to push the volume limits around 13 million and and sure enough we reached our price target fairly soon and I didn't see any signs of this stopping.
BULL11|I'm going to back out onto the 15 minute time frame and as you can see it ran all the way to 1164 to create an all time high for Shopify.
NEUT12|In which case I did hold.
BEAR13|I sold around the 1040 level where it honestly just had a slight.
BEAR14|Call back, I saw that first red candle I got out before anything could possibly get me to lose any profits and it didn't really pull back that much.
BULL15|It continued to rise, broke above 1050 and now has been channeling sideways for a nice bull flag.
NEUT16|So where is this going to go tomorrow?
NEUT17|Now I'm going to back this out onto the one hour time frame just to give us a little bit more.
BULL18|Information on what's more important levels to look for so 1144 was the previous high and looking back at this level, it's going to need to get above that to continue to my $1200 price target.
BULL19|Now I do think Shopify does have the gusto to get there.
BEAR20|It's just I don't know if it's going to have a slight pullback tomorrow or if it's going to give up some of its gains for profit taking.
BULL21|But realistically, when Shopify starts to move, especially when it makes a new high, it can tend to keep those gains and continue into the next day.
BULL22|So I'm really hoping that Shopify will fold this trend and move on to a higher price target around $1200 in the next few days.
