BULL0|"""Hey Sean Hathaway here have a great weekend coming up."
NEUT1|Happy Friday to everybody you have see fights on Saturday.
NEUT2|Lots of playoff football Sunday.
NEUT3|Monday is a holiday for a bunch of people and then Tuesday we've got the Netflix earnings call, which is a really big deal if you've been following this whole streaming wars.
NEUT4|This, you know, hashtag streaming wars is kind of a new concept.
NEUT5|Yesterday, NBC just announced Peacock.
NEUT6|I'm guessing a lot of people in my sister and her Peacock, and I'm guessing like 0 people outside of the United States have ever heard of Peacock, but that's generally how I would summarize the streaming wars.
NEUT7|So we have all of this discussion of the apples in the Disney's and the Amazons and the HBO Max and the Hulas and blah blah blah blah.
NEUT8|But nobody watch is this stuff outside the United States.
NEUT9|Now there is competition outside the United States, but Netflix is really the big boy on the block and really has global infrastructure and global global streaming.
BULL10|So I think the whole competition against Netflix is a little bit overblown, but this quarter is going to be a little bit of the proof is in the pudding, so Netflix guided to 7.6 million Subs growth in Q4.
NEUT11|Now keep in mind last Q4.
NEUT12|So a year ago it was they had 88.8 or 8 something.
NEUT13|So they've actually said below.
NEUT14|So I think that they're actually under guiding.
BULL15|I think they're going to surpass surpass that number.
BEAR16|Their stock price has been.
BEAR17|Has been hindered largely due to a Q2 miss on domestic Subs like the first ever decrease in domestic Subs for the company, but that was in the face of price increases globally and so I think that that gets a little discounted in the news, but nevertheless missed their growth forecast in Q2.
NEUT18|And then we've got this whole environment streaming or so.
NEUT19|This is actually a really important earnings call for them so people will say well as Netflix done growing is there is their growth.
NEUT20|Going to slow.
NEUT21|Here's how I think about it broadly.
NEUT22|A lot of people are going to disagree with me, but this is how I think about First off.
NEUT23|You can think in terms of global broadband households, big round numbers.
NEUT24|Maybe there's a billion and Netflix has 160,000,000.
BULL25|That means they've got a 16% penetration globally.
NEUT26|Definitely room for growth there, but what if I was to say it's actually bigger than broadband?
NEUT27|Households would have looked at like Facebook Daily Subs 'cause I definitely a goal.
NEUT28|Could be that everybody on Facebook uses Netflix again.
NEUT29|Kind of random, but that's two and a half billion.
NEUT30|Daily users of Facebook, so that would tell me then that Netflix has a 6% penetration.
NEUT31|Now have a look at the markets.
NEUT32|They forget about broadband households.
NEUT33|I want every single person that's got a cell phone in their hand.
NEUT34|While I just read that there's like 9 billion cell phones in the world, there's only seven and a half billion people.
NEUT35|So let's just go down and say, OK, well on average, every every person's got a cell phone.
NEUT36|So if you look at the global population 7 half billion and say that's your goal, well now you'd say Netflix only has about a 2%.
NEUT37|Penetration so.
BULL38|Long and short of it is, I think there is a ton of room for growth here.
NEUT39|I think they're going to figure it out.
BULL40|They're going to continue to grow.
NEUT41|Everyone else is going into streaming.
NEUT42|Not a big deal, by the way, if you don't go into streaming, you go out of business.
NEUT43|So expect more people to go into streaming.
NEUT44|And I think Netflix goes to $500 in the next 12 months.
NEUT45|That's my call.
NEUT46|"Have a good one."""
