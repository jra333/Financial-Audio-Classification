NEUT0|"""Bond ETF's are an increasingly popular part of the market as managers look for precision tools to move around their portfolios."
NEUT1|I'm Chris, Dieterich, writer, writer and editor funds at Barons.
NEUT2|I'm here with Bob Smith, Chief investment Officer at Sage Advisory in Austin, TX.
NEUT3|Bob people have been talking about what the Federal Reserve is going to do for a really, really long time.
NEUT4|Talk to me about your view about that and how you been moving around your ETF bond portfolio.
BULL5|Good day, Chris, thank you.
NEUT6|We believe that the Fed is in a hold position at the moment.
BEAR7|We don't believe that we are going to see any major shift in policy to towards the end of this year, and certainly probably well into the first half of next year.
NEUT8|What's that done for our portfolios?
NEUT9|Basically, we were very cautious going into the beginning of 2015.
BULL10|Our maturities will a little bit shorter than the market, and while we felt that we wanted to be very well diversified, we felt valuations got very high for corporate bonds for high yield bonds and so forth.
NEUT11|So we brought those back and we reduce those.
NEUT12|And as we got into the middle of the year.
NEUT13|We felt that we wanted to be a little bit more defensive with regard to interest rates and yield spreads between the sectors that didn't turn out to be the case.
BEAR14|The market corrected over the summer and as we got into the back end of the summer, we thought the market got very pessimistic.
BEAR15|In fact, overly pessimistic relative to the underlying fundamentals.
NEUT16|Did that present a bit of an opportunity for you to step in?
NEUT17|Absolutely, we felt that the baby was indeed thrown out with the bathwater and that we moved back into the high yield market for our core plus.
NEUT18|Fixed income strategy and highlight for us what which specific ETF you like for high yield.
NEUT19|For us, we tend to buy the more passively oriented index oriented ETF so hyg which is the largest in the marketplace has the highest trading volume, largest amount of securities.
BULL20|The greatest diversification we felt that was an appropriate measure.
NEUT21|We also went into preferred stock and convertible bonds as well.
NEUT22|That's great so a little bit of time for a little bit more risk.
NEUT23|At this point you know there's so many, there's nearly 300 bond ETF's on the market.
NEUT24|Maybe highlight just.
NEUT25|One, two, or three things that that all investors should look at before they before they dive into bond ETF.
NEUT26|Sure, I think the rules of the road are really important.
NEUT27|First thing is understand the index that underlies your ETF, understand its composition, how it's put together, what its risk, reward characteristics are not only right now, but what they've been historically, because if you don't understand that, you shouldn't be buying a security that's based on that.
NEUT28|The second thing is, is the size and scale of the provider.
NEUT29|We generally prefer to be working with an operating with ETF's that are brought to market by very large providers.
NEUT30|Who have deep resources and very large scale to provide information to provide help and market making and research.
NEUT31|And then the third part is really understanding the security itself.
NEUT32|It's not just about the lowest expense ratio, but it's the expenses that I'm paying and the expense ratio as well as the tracking error.
NEUT33|The percentage of replication in my ETF of the underlying index, the volume of how much does this trade on a day to day basis, not only in terms of frequency, but how many participants?
NEUT34|What types of investors are involved?
NEUT35|And then Lastly the size of the ETF.
NEUT36|So absolutely, take care to look under the hood and make sure it's trading enough.
BULL37|That's yes, Chris, without a doubt excellent.
BULL38|Well, thanks so much for joining us, Bob.
NEUT39|"This is an increase of Baron signing off."""
