NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Everybody today I'm going to CSX.
NEUT2|They just had something happen on Friday.
NEUT3|Man in the Ridge just sold $305 million of its shares and let's get right into what's going on.
NEUT4|And just like to remind you to subscribe to my channel to balance to get the notifications.
NEUT5|And like the video, let's get right into it.
NEUT6|Large stockholder of CSX sells 305 million of shares on Wednesday.
NEUT7|They sold 1.93 million shares and then on Friday they ended up selling 2.78 million.
NEUT8|Of CSX shares, so is this going to be the trend in the next coming weeks or months and our other institutional holders?
NEUT9|Are they going to start following suit?
NEUT10|Lots of questions.
BEAR11|You can see the employees aren't really too happy with CSX.
NEUT12|You can see there's a CSX ***** page and one of the bosses at CSX said this.
NEUT13|You'll do what you're told.
BEAR14|You little bleep that could have been anything so we also got employees suing CSX.
BEAR15|So basically suing them for wrongful termination.
BEAR16|So basically they called out sick.
BEAR17|And then they either got terminated or they got suspended.
BEAR18|So last year they terminated 4000 jobs and this is from contractors and employees and some employees have said that they even been denied personal days off and sick days.
NEUT19|So this goes into what they were saying and why some of the employees are actually suing the company.
BEAR20|So nonetheless CSX by 2020 is going to be shedding 3000 more employees so they keep on firing more and more employees.
BEAR21|They're really trying to save money here and cut the books.
NEUT22|So right here they got the target price going for 7468.
NEUT23|I don't really see it getting there for some reason, I just don't.
NEUT24|The man on the Ridge right here.
NEUT25|This is an updated yet they have 42 million something shares and now they're pretty much going to be under 40 million shares.
NEUT26|But it's still a substantial amount of shares.
NEUT27|All of these other institutional Holdings still have a lot of shares, so here's a CSX web page you can see.
BEAR28|Very nice has scrolling photos, so look at the chart pulled up here high of 76 and a low of 58 is going to see is definitely in a downtrend at the trend line right here.
BEAR29|It's trending down.
NEUT30|This is at resistance right now, and this is what makes me think why they actually sold.
NEUT31|Let me zoom in here.
NEUT32|So I got a gut feeling that they think that this stock is not going to go up any higher than this resistance right here, so that's why I gotta feeling they sold right around this area.
NEUT33|So they're trying to get their profits and just get out.
NEUT34|So that's why I'm thinking this might be a good short right now.
NEUT35|Definitely a long term one, so the stock price right now is at 66 point $0.20.
BEAR36|Like I said, I think it would be a really good time to get in here for a short and then if it drops down a lot then I don't think it's going to be pretty.
NEUT37|Goodbye once the market starts to recover and everything.
NEUT38|So just like to remind you to subscribe to my channel, hit the Bell so you get notifications and like this video.
