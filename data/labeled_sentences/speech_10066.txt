NEUT0|"""Hello, investors are welcome back to another Neo stock NEWS UPDATE now."
NEUT1|While 2020 has been a year, most people would prefer to regret now Neo has had an epic year in 2020.
BULL2|This talk of course, is up over 1000% crushing the S&P 500.
BULL3|And of course, Tesla has only jumped 670% this year.
BULL4|So on that note, Neo has been a more profitable stock to hold in the year 2020.
BEAR5|Of course, Tesla has jumped 670 and of course Neo just pulled back from our November high of $0.57 or $57.20 and is actually now trading just short of $0.45.
BULL6|'cause with Neo solid monthly growth and endings and growing demand for electric vehicles, we believe that NEO stock could be one of the top electric vehicle winners going forward.
BULL7|Of course, we also expect that shares will rise further once the company's December delivery numbers are released in early January.
NEUT8|And of course, after exploding higher, the company actually announced it would sell another 60 million shares of its US talk.
NEUT9|And of course, the cash was aimed to raise the cash raised from this year's called Help.
BULL10|Neo actually grow even more as Chinese electric vehicles ourselves accelerate, adding to that the Chinese government apparently wants more electric vehicles on the road and granted at this talk cell will be dilutive for existing shareholders.
NEUT11|However, as we all know, afternoon sold 75 million of its US shares in August.
NEUT12|The stock ran from 13.
NEUT13|Dollars in $0.20 to actually $57.20.
NEUT14|So after this sale that has just finished for NEO, you should expect an uprise when it comes to the Neo stock price.
BEAR15|But of course, since October, the company's deliveries have remained above 5000 units every month, doubling year over year in November, for the eighth consecutive month.
BULL16|Now in October news deliveries rose just over 100% year over year and over the last 11 months the companies deliveries have surged 111% year over year to 36,721 vehicles.
NEUT17|Now of course ahead of the company's release of its December delivery numbers in early January.
BULL18|We expect this talk to actually climb again, and as we noted on December 10, Neo stock usually moves higher.
NEUT19|After the company releases its delivery data.
NEUT20|Now that phenomenon occurred earlier this month as well, and in each of three previous months.
NEUT21|So we also expect the same this month, so you should always keep your mind on that.
NEUT22|The sell of these talks have finished, so you should pay attention to the Neo stock price.
BULL23|It will definitely.
NEUT24|Be on a surge and the end.
NEUT25|In my own opinion, I believe that the upside will start on early January, once the December delivery report is announced.
NEUT26|So yeah, keep in touch.
NEUT27|Keep in touch for more details on that.
NEUT28|Stay connected.
NEUT29|We will definitely bring you the the December quarter report.
NEUT30|The quarter four 2020 report.
