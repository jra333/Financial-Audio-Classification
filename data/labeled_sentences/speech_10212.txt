BULL0|"""Since I last started talking about this stock, the stock has already went up by 400%."
NEUT1|You can probably check my last couple of videos on Jaguar Health Agency and the way the stock has moved it as it is currently giving us some signals that there are further upside which are yet to become so.
BULL2|Hello Friends, welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video.
NEUT3|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about the next upcoming moves.
BULL4|Of Jaguar help Diancie and the confidence does comes because the stock has indeed.
BULL5|Make some of the decent moves and already surpass the.
NEUT6|Intermediate An some of the important resistance level, so that's where the resistance comes, and that's where the stock has successfully performed.
BULL7|An give us some phenomenal returns.
NEUT8|In the last one or two months.
NEUT9|Now, having said that, the levels which we are going to look at first is 1.72 because 1.72 previously was your resistance level.
NEUT10|Now it will act as a support level and your next support will come at .86.
BULL11|OK, once you're not go below .86, so this is the final support 'cause one must remember that in the stock has started moving up since last October.
NEUT12|It has already given you a return worth 780%, so any kind of correction or volatility.
NEUT13|May come in the overall.
BULL14|That we're looking at or it may come in the near term as well, so one must we know about this fact and these two levels would probably help you as your support level, because if the stock started falling below .86 then again the probability will open up 4.14.
NEUT15|And that's why you should not go below .86.
NEUT16|Now if this talk started.
NEUT17|Moving above.
NEUT18|1.72 as it has already done.
BULL19|But if it sustains in the same way as it is right now, then we are at least looking at a target which is as high as $8.00 for the time being.
NEUT20|OK, so this will be a target, and it may extend up to here we have.
NEUT21|This level.
NEUT22|Which is.
NEUT23|$10.00 So that's what we're looking at for the time being, and with this kind of move there is every possibility for the stock to move on.
NEUT24|The higher end of the range, and the upside that we're looking at it at least 400 plus so.
NEUT25|This is the move which probably come if the stock holds more specifically above 1.72, but it should not go below .86.
NEUT26|OK, so that's the thing you need to understand and that's the target which we're looking at in the weekly chart for the time being, we will re analyze it once it once the stock surpass.
NEUT27|Any of the level or depending upon the nature of the move, so this is the end of the video.
