NEUT0|"""Jennifer, are we going to see inflation in 2021 in the US?"
BULL1|We're going to already started seeing a little bit bubble up.
BEAR2|Whether or not this is going to be sustained is another story, but I think you know, we've been saying that inflation will stay low, but it's not going to stay at such low levels as what we saw.
BULL3|You know, over the past six months or so, things are starting to improve.
BULL4|We've gotten past that first wave.
BEAR5|Now we're in the second wave, which is show is showing that it's not as it's not hitting the economy as badly as it did earlier in March.
BULL6|So we are starting to see inflation pick up a little bit.
BEAR7|We're starting to see some supply shortages because of, you know, because of either shortages in the goods themselves or because of the people that are breaking them.
BULL8|You know you're a lot about labor shortages these days for various reasons, so we are starting to see inflation pick up a little bit.
NEUT9|I don't think it's going to be rising too quickly again.
BULL10|Just like with interest rates, I think they're going to say this is going to start increasing.
BULL11|"Probably a more of a modest pace."""
