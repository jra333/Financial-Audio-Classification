NEUT0|"""Doctor Nielsen, the markets want the Fed to act."
NEUT1|What is the history of central bankers when they are told what to do?
NEUT2|They had Tom that they they usually do something, and particularly in extraordinary circumstances like we have now, I think you could you.
NEUT3|I wouldn't be surprised if it moved ahead of the of the meeting, but certainly the first weight cut is is on its way, almost without a doubt.
NEUT4|The first rate cuts on its way.
BULL5|Your former colleague, Jan Hatzius, Goldman Sachs quite clear today about a coordinated fashion.
NEUT6|How does central bankers coordinate?
NEUT7|Is it?
NEUT8|You know, they get.
NEUT9|Nobody wears Burberry Plaid?
NEUT10|Or you know how do they?
NEUT11|How do you coordinate an intervention to cut rates?
NEUT12|I don't think you really can, so I'm not sure what John said about this, but I, but my view is the following that that there's a.
BULL13|There's a cord coming up on the G7 level.
NEUT14|It's very good for the market to be told that policy, coordination and communication is is taking place between central banks and between the physical and the central bank authorities.
NEUT15|But how do you coordinate a rate cut?
NEUT16|If I, God forbid, the ECP just comes out and does 10 basis points or something?
NEUT17|It's a for me.
NEUT18|If the ECP is liquid ITI and the terms of liquidity.
NEUT19|That would matter, not a rate cut.
BEAR20|Actually, rate color DCP could, could could be bad in my opinion.
NEUT21|But Eric, I don't really understand what you know.
BULL22|Central bank help could actually do to ease market.
NEUT23|I mean sure it helps with market fear, but this is not a financial concern.
NEUT24|This is possibly people being scared not going out to spend.
NEUT25|Yes, that's right.
NEUT26|So they said we have to understand the difference between a supply shock in a demand shock and even a demand shock as several people, including my former boss gaming David, said that there's a lot of that going on right now.
NEUT27|But if the demand shock is that people are scared of, traveling is not, that is forbidden, it is still a demand shock with the effects of like a supply shock.
NEUT28|Meaning, as you said, exactly you can give them a tax break.
NEUT29|You can give a lower interest rate, but we're still not going to move.
NEUT30|We're still gonna be scared and not do anything.
NEUT31|So there's like the economics of fear.
NEUT32|"If you will, but what the central banks can do it is that they can by providing the credit E. They can stem some of the negative impact of the tightening of financial conditions that the market is now imposing on the world, and then also you can, along with the fiscal authorities, for example, provide liquidity and or guarantees so that companies which are temporarily impacted in a negative way at least don't go out of business."""
