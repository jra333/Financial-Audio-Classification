NEUT0|"""Yo yo yo, what's going on guys I am back here with another video and in today's video I will be charting ticker BLNK or Blink Charging Co. Now this stock is a EV charging company so they did have a lot of hype in the past."
NEUT1|Uh, I think the hipster is still there, but.
NEUT2|This chart looks amazing.
NEUT3|I think going into this week, this by far has to be my favorite setup, right?
NEUT4|So I already charted this, but let's look at it, right?
BULL5|So off the bat is strong uptrend right massive amount of volume towards the TV hype.
NEUT6|If you guys don't know what EV means it means a electrical vehicle hype.
BULL7|All right, new higher lows are forming good price action as well as this red line which is my 20 simple moving average and it was acting as a pretty good support right here.
NEUT8|Once their choice there and now if you look here it's starting up again and.
NEUT9|Let's go to about this chart, is that?
NEUT10|It bounced off it, but also set a very strong bullish pattern, which is the falling wedge, right?
NEUT11|So if we could break this, we could target on $58, but my target honestly is $60.00.
BULL12|Plus it has been forming new higher highs, so that's why.
NEUT13|I'm targeting that, but if you guys see here, I said the previous resistance can become support and it didn't right.
BULL14|This was a good resistance level right here.
BULL15|And it didn't write, broke through and then I said if it breaks that we should wait for it to see if it bounces off, because in the past it was a pretty strong support.
NEUT16|And that's exactly what it's doing, right?
NEUT17|If you look at a closer time frame, right?
BEAR18|It looks like it's going to bounce off.
BULL19|And if we look at our Richter Award it's really good, right?
NEUT20|3% to win 30%.
NEUT21|But if I'm talking $60.00, which is all the way over here.
NEUT22|That is 36 almost 37%, which is totally insane.
BULL23|So I do think that billing K going into the week is a very strong buy and you guys should definitely keep it on.
NEUT24|"Watch this, but other than that please little, if you guys want me to try any other stock and I am."""
