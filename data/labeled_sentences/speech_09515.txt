NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, this is Jeff Skilling and for the insidetechnician.com and today I'm gonna make a demonstrated walkthrough on another recent trade that I took on Cray."
BULL1|The symbol is CR Ay craze assigned to the computer sector, and this was a trade that a whole time of about 3 days and brought us in a net profit of 10%.
BULL2|Craig came on my radar screen in a big way on 527 2010 right here with this huge volume spike.
BULL3|From that day forward, it was tracked in anticipation of a developmental trade to the upside.
BULL4|If we look back here, we can see we had a solid bottom that was established here.
BULL5|Another bottom established here.
NEUT6|Giving us a widespread double bottom and the kind of support we look for this floor level when we're in anticipation of an upside move.
NEUT7|Let's also take note on volume with these two additional spikes here and this additional block of accumulation here.
NEUT8|Let's blow this up for a second.
NEUT9|You can see clearly 527 these two spikes.
NEUT10|This really showed us.
NEUT11|That all the institutional guys, offshore banks, pension fund managers role in heavy on Cray.
NEUT12|And anytime we have this kind of accumulation of volume, I immediately want to look to the money flow indicator.
NEUT13|Look at this money flow indicator an look at the confirmation that this indicator gave us.
NEUT14|Proving out that this was insider accumulation incredible.
NEUT15|Referencing MACD, let's take a look here and we can see clearly how we had a crossover here with continued upside movement.
NEUT16|This told us that we wanted to be in as soon as possible on a chart pattern development stochastics.
BULL17|Here the same we had already crossed here from below to above continued upside movement.
NEUT18|Another confirmation to belong.
NEUT19|As soon as the chart pattern developed, let's go back and look at that chart pattern for a second here.
NEUT20|Right here we had a trend line that had developed subsequent crossover from here.
NEUT21|Two above here, and this is exactly the day that we were in on June 9th at about 5:10 for a three day trade that got us out about here on June 11th at 560, again in here.
NEUT22|Out here on a Feb Annachi profit target level for a 10% move there was a lot of money we made on this trade here.
NEUT23|Just a beautiful trade.
BULL24|It came through force and everybody who follows us knows that we like to trade with a lot of volume under our belt and this really gives us the kind of confidence that we need to load up put on a big position and make a lot of money in a short period of time.
NEUT25|So this is how this trade came through for us.
NEUT26|And this is how we do it.
