NEUT0|"""We want to get to a report here."
BULL1|Sticking with Tech Apple is close to reaching a deal with Hyundai Kia.
NEUT2|Now this is for its Apple car.
NEUT3|We want to bring in Hallie for the latest on this and and I guess what can you tell us at this point about what we know?
NEUT4|Regarding this.
NEUT5|Yeah, so the the partnership.
NEUT6|It sounds like according to reports that it would be Apple building out its car from a plant in West Point, Virginia.
NEUT7|It would be a Kia plant and basically they would end up using some of Hyundais own technologies.
NEUT8|As far as electricity goes, electrification goes to build the vehicle, but to still have say in how the vehicle looks and the software inside now Appleton working on its project Titan.
NEUT9|This is what the cars been called since 2014.
NEUT10|It's gone through fits and starts.
NEUT11|First it was going to build its own vehicle.
NEUT12|Then maybe it's how hard that was for Tesla and decided not to do that.
NEUT13|Then they pivoted and we're going to software, and now they're back to doing a full car with a partner, so it'll be interesting to see how this goes down the line.
NEUT14|But reports are that we could see at Apple Car on the road, perhaps as soon as 2024, and a prototype by next year.
NEUT15|Do you want to get to your tech support that you have this week sticking with Apple because you're looking into the new privacy feature?
NEUT16|Yeah, they have something called at transparency tracking or app tracking transparency rather and it really has started a war between Apple and Facebook.
NEUT17|Let me give you an idea of what it is you have on your iPhone.
NEUT18|Something called an ID for advertisers or I dfu.
BEAR19|Now this is a temporary tracker.
NEUT20|It doesn't take personal information, but it allows advertisers to follow you across apps and the web.
NEUT21|Apple wants to cut that out entirely.
NEUT22|The problem though according to Facebook, is that if they do it will make it.
NEUT23|Harder for advertisers to understand who they're targeting and how well those targeted ads turn out.
NEUT24|So Facebook is essentially saying that it would end up costing advertisers as much as 50%.
BEAR25|Sorry, small businesses that advertise as much as 50% in revenue because they wouldn't be hitting the right people for their products.
NEUT26|Now for Apple's part, it says this is all part of privacy and they want to do this to ensure consumer privacy and that there are other ways that people can go about providing advertising on their products.
NEUT27|And then as far as Facebook goes now, they're contemplating filing their own antitrust suit against Apple as result of all of this, basically saying that look, Apple wants to take away the ability for app developers to provide their apps for free via advertising they want, then those developers to pay or have people pay for their apps, and then that would go into Apple's coffers via it's 30% charge in the App Store.
NEUT28|It's kind of a roundabout way of doing things.
NEUT29|Facebook is also joined.
NEUT30|"Epic's lawsuit against Apple in antitrust, not necessarily joining it, but is assisting in those proceedings."""
