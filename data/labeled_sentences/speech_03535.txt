BEAR3|While the gold recovered on the other hand, there is great expectation about the possible decrease of India's imports of gold, which may decline in March.
BEAR4|About half rates recorded in April and May due to the retreat of purchasing power.
BEAR5|The goal has maintained a sideways trading below the simple moving average 500, which indicates the strong bearish trend of the gold prices.
