NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for October 20th, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm roughly by John currencyanalystericsson.com.
NEUT2|Today we will look at the US dollar versus the Mexican peso on the four hourly chart.
BULL3|USD MXN rallied from 18.25 to 19.91 back in September, when the US presidential race was going in favor of Donald Trump.
BEAR4|However, the pair hit a six week low of 18.45 today following disappointing performance by Trump in the final election debate.
BULL5|Prices have since rebounded back an hour currently.
NEUT6|Just around the 10 consent line at 18 point 56th, rebound could lead to test of the Kijun Sen Line, the Blue line at 18.75.
BEAR7|At today's low DRS I gave a strong oversold reading at that volume to 23 is currently at 32 and a recovery closer to 50 could possibly allow fresh USD MXN shorts with the aim of reaching 18.25 or possibly going below.
BEAR8|18 the near term prospects for the pair are bearish as prices.
BEAR9|Below the cloud and tank and sent an kitchen.
BEAR10|Send lines are negatively aligned, however, with prices so deep below the cloud, this suggests that some overextended selling has taken place and ideally the price must retrace some of its losses and move closer to below the cloud just before the fresh shorts.
BULL11|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
