NEUT0|"""We work's business model, absolutely depends on it."
NEUT1|Raising more money, and that's sort of been the story with them from the start, where every year they keep doubling their valuation and basically doubling the amount they raise.
NEUT2|So if they're going to keep growing, they need to keep raising money.
NEUT3|How much money, Elliott?
BEAR4|Because it seems like the valuation issues as they prepared to go public are going to be a big problem for them.
NEUT5|You've got as well to motor and out now saying that's a $14 billion valuation.
NEUT6|You know the initial range was supposed to be in the 20s, and maybe it can still get there.
NEUT7|You know, what do you think they need to to strive for?
NEUT8|Many billions and yeah like you said, it's this weird puzzle where if you need to raise 3 billion IPO to get 6 billion in debt.
BEAR9|But then the problem with that is you have to pay it back so and if their valuation is lower than something they have a lot more debt compared to the size of the company.
NEUT10|I mean the short answer is, as long as they want to keep growing, which is the pitch they've made to investors, they need to really sort of double their spending every year.
NEUT11|At least that's been the pattern for the past history 9 year history we were so handicap the risks for me.
NEUT12|For we work as I understand it in my.
BEAR13|Understanding may be imperfect here.
BEAR14|If they shelve the listing, they lose access to a loan or a line of credit.
BEAR15|If they reduce the listing that puts SoftBank the roost.
NEUT16|Reduce the size of the IPO and the valuation.
BEAR17|That hurts SoftBank and its ability.
NEUT18|Who is one of the biggest backers and its ability to raise a funding round?
NEUT19|On the other hand, if they go with an IPO and it flops, there's a big risk there.
NEUT20|So handicap the risks for me.
NEUT21|Yeah, I mean I, I think that's pretty well put, SoftBank.
BEAR22|It's a really bad look right now.
NEUT23|If they were to have a big markdown on.
NEUT24|We work because they're trying to raise a ton of money on the thesis that there are really good tech investor and for we work, yeah.
NEUT25|I mean, if you get more money from soft Bank, it's a big reputational hit because you pulled an IPO.
BEAR26|That's embarrassing.
NEUT27|On the other hand, Regis, which basically has a very similar business model to we work was the Hot Office company of 99 and 2000.
BEAR28|They pulled their IPO in 99 after very similar arguments were being made.
NEUT29|Leslie, I mean to Elliott's point about the impact on SoftBank, it seems like the impact would be almost greater on SoftBank than it would be for we work.
NEUT30|Yes, it would raise less money, but I would think that early investors already writing down the valuation of their steaks on their books.
NEUT31|So the impact won't be felt there.
BEAR32|But for SoftBank, this follows Uber and it follows Slack, which haven't been trading well.
NEUT33|So it's sort of like damned if you do, damned if you don't.
NEUT34|For SoftBank, there's certainly a pattern here with.
BULL35|Regard to these recent IPOs that soft bank has back.
NEUT36|Although it's important to note for we work, I mean in comparison with Uber and Slack.
NEUT37|Those are, you know, they're off their trading in the public markets may be lower than where they intended to initially, but but they're still kind of doing their thing with regard to we work.
BEAR38|There was a Bernstein note today that said that if they don't have about $7.2 billion worth of capital to fund their free cash flow losses over the next few years over the next four years.
NEUT39|I mean, they're basically.
BEAR40|Out of business they need this capital to stay alive so it's a matter of you know this is a company that risks going down to zero if they don't have the capital to fund their operations, especially given the various plans that they've set forth, and that, by the way, is in a non recessionary scenario.
NEUT41|Bernstein stressed for a recession in 2020 and in that scenario they would need upwards of $9 billion in capital to fund their operations.
NEUT42|So this this cash isn't really like a nice to have.
NEUT43|"It's kind of a need to have for this company."""
