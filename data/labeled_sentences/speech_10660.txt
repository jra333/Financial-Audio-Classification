BULL0|"""So tonight on Valley brand new list, this is a less in your face, but possibly more potent reopening place since they're all being ignored, even though they should have had a great year."
NEUT1|If we can just get back to normal by June now.
NEUT2|By the way, none of these stocks is is is is low.
NEUT3|OK, I'm just saying that they're not considered reopening place, so we're going to start with one that people think is a closed closed economy stock.
NEUT4|And that's not true.
NEUT5|It's square.
NEUT6|This is a popular peer to peer payments, platform cash app, terrific point of sale system is tide into the small business lending platform.
NEUT7|Oh, and just tonight breaking news.
NEUT8|They're now saying that they're opening their own bank to cater more what equal holistic experience.
NEUT9|And that's gigantic news that I I have to tell you.
NEUT10|I think the animals are going to Crow about it tomorrow.
BEAR11|Now about 150,000 restaurants have gone under because of the pandemic, but for the first time in ages, big cities have reasonable rents, and RAM was always the killer for the restaurant industry.
BEAR12|Now people grumble about the minimum wage or food costs, but as someone with two restaurants at trust me on this, OK, it's the rent that's the killer with rents down and lots of people eager to go out again.
NEUT13|I'm betting we'll see a restaurant renaissance with people eating out rather than ordering in, and that's per square.
NEUT14|Lots more in person transactions using their hardware, and they can also make a mint by lending money to the ones with the best prospects.
NEUT15|And now these same people bank with this new square bank that I'm talking about, rather than the current bank one piece of the Puzzle Square bought a bundle of Bitcoin at about $10,000 for the cash management, and it's now closer to 50,000 huge home run and they just put more.
NEUT16|Remember, they're actually using.
NEUT17|It is what I say it should be.
NEUT18|You should have some cash.
NEUT19|If you're running a company and you said some Bitcoin, I know that only square seems to agree with me, but I don't care.
NEUT20|They're smart guys.
BULL21|Even better, squares cash app platform is become the easiest place to buy Bitcoin, which could be used now.
NEUT22|The crypto currencies become a worldwide sensation.
NEUT23|They got on this bandwagon rolling back in 2018.
NEUT24|I know people buying a dollars, buying $100 of Bitcoin and they're all using the square app.
NEUT25|You maybe you should too.
NEUT26|OK, I am pro Bitcoin thousands of younger people are doing this.
NEUT27|Second, less obvious.
NEUT28|This is an idea that I haven't talked enough that Ralph Lauren created.
BULL29|This one is already 50 kindness, but I think it's got a lot more room to run.
BEAR30|Ralph Lauren used to use this downturn to close underperforming stores that they took advantage of the downturn while betting heavily on direct to consumer and digitizing its advertising.
NEUT31|The big pivot toward Tik T.O.K, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.
NEUT32|But a whole new demo to the stores.
NEUT33|I know the stock is run but Can you imagine how well will do once people feel comfortable shopping in person in?
NEUT34|Now think about it like this.
BULL35|L Brands is up 52% for the year, and they're not even fit to shine Ralph Lauren shoes even as RLS.
NEUT36|We have 16%.
NEUT37|I got another one that we just had not talked enough about lately.
NEUT38|It's Ulta beauty alright.
BEAR39|This cosmetics retailer really managed to hang in there doing it very difficult.
NEUT40|They create their own app that shows you how you look with certain colorations and they pivoted hard e-commerce.
NEUT41|But this is the year when Ulta moves into target, a store within a store.
NEUT42|OK starting with 100 locations nationwide, I'm telling you this move is not in the numbers nor is the fact that they have a tremendous partnership with Estee Lauder.
BEAR43|One of the reasons I no longer worry about American Department store, so they sell it in Alta Evolta can make this much money with its business completely hammered and crippled by the pandemic.
NEUT44|Think about what will do when you go to the stores and trial makeup and not worry anymore.
