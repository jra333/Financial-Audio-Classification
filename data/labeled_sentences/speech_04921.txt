NEUT0|"""Oh hey, can you pass me my iPad?"
NEUT1|Yeah, just just put it, put it through the screen there.
NEUT2|Yeah, there we go.
NEUT3|There we go.
BULL4|Thank you, that's much better.
NEUT5|It would have been hard to do this video without the iPad.
NEUT6|Thank you so much for that, let's go ahead and talk about this.
NEUT7|Though The Motley Fool, an article coming out.
NEUT8|Forget Dodge coin.
NEUT9|These are the smartest stocks to buy.
NEUT10|Now I'm The Motley Fool.
NEUT11|I don't understand doge coin.
NEUT12|I roasted them a little bit on Twitter, but basically in the article they were saying doge coin.
NEUT13|It's all bark, no bite, it's all bark, no bite.
NEUT14|Don't understand.
NEUT15|It's legitimately good cryptocurrency.
NEUT16|5 billion combined year 120 billion circulation.
NEUT17|So it will take more than 25 years to double.
BULL18|Code updates continuing to happen, making it better.
NEUT19|It's actually a good cryptocurrency people to understand that at The Motley Fool they don't get it, but take a look.
NEUT20|So this is the dude who actually wrote the article.
NEUT21|His name is Sean Williams.
NEUT22|This is what Sean said about Bitcoin.
NEUT23|Only if you want to go, make sure to hit that like we're hoping to grow the Dutchman Community cryptocurrency is not going to take off, and less were actually participating in sharing information and by clicking like you can actually help with that.
NEUT24|But this is what he said.
NEUT25|Put plainly, Bitcoin is dangerous, dangerous, he says is driven by short term emotions.
NEUT26|Technical analysis.
BEAR27|And misinformation about scarcity.
NEUT28|So it's not actual investing.
NEUT29|It's not a hedge against the dollar, which it is.
NEUT30|None of the positive stuff about cryptocurrency.
NEUT31|None of that's always saying is, it's emotional.
NEUT32|He also very specifically and outright said it's the one.
BULL33|Investment should strongly avoid in 2021, one of the best performing investments of all 21 Doge coin.
BULL34|Of course, a much, much better performing investment.
BULL35|That's only because don't want crazy, but Bitcoin did pretty damn good so far in 2021.
BULL36|It's gone up a lot.
NEUT37|And yet if you had listened to Sean, you would not have put any money into cryptocurrency, probably at all.
NEUT38|I guess what can we expect?
NEUT39|What can we expect from someone like Sean who's been around for 400 years?
NEUT40|He still used to all the old stuff.
NEUT41|Kind of has a slick back here to go to you so little bit a little bit of a joke there 400 years he's been around 400 years.
NEUT42|I told him directly.
NEUT43|Don't hate on Doe, just 'cause you don't understand it then also said can you all of us in the future now what the 90s is like right now?
BULL44|It is cool that you found a way to be living there.
NEUT45|Keep in mind that Sean, he's not really a bad dude or anything.
NEUT46|He hasn't done anything terrible.
NEUT47|It's OK to roast them a little bit obviously, but we don't want to being mean.
NEUT48|So don't be mean to Sean.
NEUT49|Sean may have no idea what he's talking about when it comes to cryptocurrency and doge coin, but at the same time that doesn't make it necessarily a bad person, so I don't wanna be mean for there we go.
NEUT50|You can see that this picture he's doing he's doing this thing.
NEUT51|It's a little bit silly.
NEUT52|It does seem like it was taken from a Nokia phone.
NEUT53|Sean, if you want to come on, you're welcome to come on the show and explain to everyone here while you think we should sell our Doge coin, I disagree strongly.
NEUT54|I would love to hear your opinion.
BEAR55|I'm at loss.
NEUT56|This is fast and help the community out.
NEUT57|"Let's all be participating and I will see you in the next video."""
