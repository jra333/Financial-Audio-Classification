BULL0|"""And some of the stuff we do, we just know it's a little better than our car."
NEUT1|Our alternatives were doing all kinds of stuff.
NEUT2|Now that we would not have done.
NEUT3|Apple stock in the old days.
NEUT4|It's a very odd thing for us to do.
NEUT5|And obviously we've got no special insights as to how sticky.
NEUT6|Apple's business is Apple.
NEUT7|Whole supply chain is like one man.
NEUT8|With two million employees, that's very peculiar, and the man is nothing, not perfect.
BEAR9|And on the other hand, Apple has a very sticky.
NEUT10|Bunch of customers.
NEUT11|Will they be able to keep that going and if so how long?
NEUT12|I don't know what I think the chances are pretty good.
BEAR13|It's going to be quite sticky and that's why we bought it.
NEUT14|But but.
BULL15|So we have a slight edge in our favorite there.
NEUT16|But it's not a big edges were doing that because we don't find the stuff we used to find.
NEUT17|Where were we knew we couldn't lose Apple?
NEUT18|We barely got.
NEUT19|We think it's a little edge.
NEUT20|We don't have a big insight that can't fail.
NEUT21|If you can't find if you got the money, yeah, put it somewhere and you can't find what you used to like.
NEUT22|You have to put it.
NEUT23|Space available ham.
NEUT24|We shouldn't really be client complaining about that got harder.
BEAR25|"The reason they got harder as we got so much money."""
