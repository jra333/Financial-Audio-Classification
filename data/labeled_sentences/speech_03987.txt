NEUT0|"""It all started my passion for cooking that maybe become meticulous about cookwares One day I told Levi, let's start our cookware brand."
NEUT1|You know the way we want the material.
NEUT2|We can decide the usability, how we want.
NEUT3|Like, OK, do we want to get into the mythology and manufacturing?
NEUT4|Let's do it.
NEUT5|There's nothing to lose.
NEUT6|Will explore will learn.
NEUT7|So we just got started.
NEUT8|So that that's how the aircraft was born.
NEUT9|We call ourselves accidental entrepreneurs.
BULL10|It's been very natural.
NEUT11|It's like we never thought this is a start up or we're being the entrepreneurs.
NEUT12|Now we have to do this.
NEUT13|We have to do that.
NEUT14|We're going to design the cookware how we want and we have to sell it to the passionate cooks, chefs, mothers.
NEUT15|There is a lot of thought that is gone in terms of usability, how user-friendly it is, because I don't think we're was thought as can be user friendly.
NEUT16|We only talk about the software or apps as user friendly.
NEUT17|That's the aspect we.
NEUT18|Brought in cookware, and we want to work more on that, like how user-friendly can this be?
NEUT19|So we had to learn metallurgy.
NEUT20|We didn't know anything about the metal composition, but we got behind it and we learned it.
NEUT21|The steel that is using the pan is is much higher quality and if some customer comes and ask us we know what exactly happening because we know what we're making right from the composition of a metal till the pan to the quality.
NEUT22|Initially we started from our garage.
NEUT23|We used to get all the curtains in our garages to store in our garage and then we used to check each each and every product product.
NEUT24|We used to sit like overnight and go on checking because daytime used to be with kids and busy, but that taught us a lot about how a quality check should be on a product.
BULL25|Once it became like huge like container wise then we have a third party logistics at California which works out better.
NEUT26|Going back to 2015, our first year revenue was like $1500.
BEAR27|That was our revenue and we definitely made a lot more losses than that last year.
NEUT28|I think the goal we had said that we will do 2,000,000 and we were like about a little over 2,000,000 this year and we have planning to double that.
NEUT29|At home, it's not a business for us, honestly.
NEUT30|It's it's something that we really love working on.
NEUT31|Some of our friends and people ask like how is it like husband and wife working and then how's the personal life?
NEUT32|We never really have felt it actually we just enjoy this journey.
NEUT33|Never felt that it's a personal and professional life is different because as we share both the same dream and same version, same passion.
NEUT34|And people are so important in startup that your co-founder, your teammates, it's less about their technical skills.
NEUT35|It's more about their attitude and mindset.
NEUT36|That's really important an you get it at home.
NEUT37|I mean, you know each other for longest you know the strengths, you know the weaknesses, and if you're able to tap into it, I think great this is the this is the best school that you can give it to your children to your kids.
NEUT38|Are there going to be challenges?
NEUT39|There will be challenges.
NEUT40|Just go with attitude of you will figure it out.
NEUT41|"You will find some solution and you will find some."""
