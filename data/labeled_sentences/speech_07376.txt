NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol USO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|What crazy crazy day.
NEUT5|We're all living through history as far as oil an pricing, all of this stuff is concerned.
NEUT6|All sorts of drama around USL, but at the end of the day, and I realize I'm stating the obvious when I say this, but just to establish some context there, this did and went through a very, very nice balance.
NEUT7|I mean, to think at one point it was all the way down here and then the price managed to bounce its way up to where it was now.
NEUT8|Of course, don't get me wrong, there's still a whole lot more work that needs to be done, but the point here being that chart looks very, very different than what it did earlier on in the day when the price was essentially just going straight down.
NEUT9|So there is a bouncer that's taken play which now does lead to the more than valid question of.
NEUT10|But is there any sort of true power behind this bounces or any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT11|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT12|You know dead cat bounce or dead cap movement type bounds going forward?
NEUT13|I have no idea, but by using charge we can make answer that question very straightforward and in my mind Torvalds ran a single area and that area is down here at $2.60.
NEUT14|Why is 260 important?
NEUT15|Well and I'm not saying this is what's going to actually happen, but let's say that the price were to come down in 260.
NEUT16|And then just continue on down.
NEUT17|What would that be doing with the price at that point?
NEUT18|Well, from a very literal perspective, that would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where it was at the Lowe's and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT19|But price movements that go back to where they were, not exactly a sign of true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT20|Now on the flip side, 'cause I mean nothing can go straight up, so maybe the price comes down here.
NEUT21|Behave like that and then begin to work way back upwards.
NEUT22|Now all of a sudden what would you have while you have a set of those right there, you have that set.
NEUT23|Of those down there.
NEUT24|If you envision each one of those as stair steps, well, hey, at least now you have progress being made in the upward direction.
NEUT25|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT26|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
NEUT27|Overtime it's going to make progress forward and again, in this situation, quote unquote progress.
NEUT28|I'm defining as $2.60 now as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT29|If this thing is going to continue to bounce upwards next key very, very interesting level of resistance.
NEUT30|Going right up there.
NEUT31|Around $3.20 off the price can get up to that level.
NEUT32|Like I said, I think that's going to be a big battle point that will be very interesting to see how the price reacts with it.
NEUT33|But All in all it did bounce today, so not just a question of can the price build upon this balance build upon this momentum, let's see what happens.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird.
NEUT39|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT40|But in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT44|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT45|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT46|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT47|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT48|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
