BULL0|"""The XL M price hints at an upswing as it trades around a crucial support level."
BULL1|The ex LM price has formed three swing highs that have tapped the resistance at 43 cents since February 23rd.
BEAR2|Similarly, three swing lows formed during the same.
BULL3|Saw a bounce from the 33 cents support barrier.
NEUT4|A flat channel seems to form by connecting the swing highs and lows using trendlines.
BULL5|This set up forecasts are 20% upswing to $0.52.
BEAR6|If the upper trendline at 43 cents is breached.
BEAR7|The most recent attempt was rejected by the upper boundary and is currently trading around the flat channels middle line at $0.39.
BULL8|A bounce from this point seems likely due to the recently spawned by signal from the Super Trend Indicator.
BULL9|Hence, a bounce from the middle line at $0.39 or the immediate support at 38 cents could propel X LM price to the upper boundary.
BULL10|A spike in bullish momentum here, leading to a decisive close above $0.43 on the 12 hour chart, will confirm a bullish breakout.
BULL11|In such a case, stellar is likely to surge 20% to hit the intended target at $0.52.
BEAR12|Adding credence to the bullish outlook is the low social volume which can be perceived as a bullish sign from a counter sentiment perspective.
BEAR13|A spike in price followed by a sudden uptick in social volumes tends to mark cycle tops more often than not.
BULL14|Therefore, a low social volume creates a perfect scenario for a surge in stellar price.
BEAR15|A sell off up to the lower boundary at $0.35 is likely implausible.
BEAR16|However, if ex LM price convincingly slides below this level, the bullish thesis will be in trouble.
BEAR17|"A decisive close below $0.33 will invalidate the positive outlook and trigger a sell off to the immediate support at $0.31."""
