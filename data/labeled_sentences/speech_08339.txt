NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clearing this via video chart on ticker symbol WKHS."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Did this analysis several times this past week, including just on Thursday.
NEUT5|So let us with the green and red line annotations are coming from and really everything remains the exact same, although there's some context within that and the big bit of context is that the day started off very very shaky.
NEUT6|Sure, the price gap down, but the problem with the gap down was it actually violated this first Green line here at $15, which I've talked about in past videos.
BEAR7|So things were looking very, very shaky.
NEUT8|'cause at one point that was a big, solid red candle.
NEUT9|However, the secondary green line again that I talked about in previous videos came into play in sure it didn't hit it.
BULL10|Exactly, but I think we all agree it got pretty darn close and then not only did that level hold as support, but also provide enough power to get not only back up to the green line, but up above it, and then after the price get back above it you can see well that $15 Mark just went right back to acting as support once again, which was a very very good sign in and of itself.
BULL11|So yes, the day without doubt started off very very rough, but you gotta give full credit credits do not only did the price bounds, not only did it get back up above it, being the price get back above $15.
NEUT12|But the price was able to stay up above it, and that one that level went right back into acting as support.
NEUT13|So point here being for $15.
NEUT14|Still that near term of support in the next level followed by 1425 and then as far as areas of resistance, nothing new to report it.
NEUT15|Still all about that overarching trend line up there.
BULL16|But yeah, no new levels, but a very actually event filled day, considering how nasty things started off but got the bounce got back above 15.
NEUT17|So let's see if the price can build upon that momentum next week.
NEUT18|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT19|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT20|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL21|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT22|The first key is super weird.
NEUT23|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT24|But in a cruel way.
BEAR25|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT26|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT27|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT28|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT29|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
