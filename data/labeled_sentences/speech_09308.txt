NEUT1|You tune into the Market Beast Edition.
NEUT2|Yes, it is.
NEUT3|Your fellow composite is speaking.
BULL4|Yeah, and now we're going to really quick update on the mankind in Mankind Corporation ticker symbol MNKD very briefly, it appears that the stock has broken out of the pattern that we've been following.
NEUT5|Guys are just joining and hopefully we're going to link for you to check out the video.
BULL6|When we entered the market is so glad to have you actually leave a comment so I can personally welcome you into the charts.
NEUT7|OK, leaving appropriate thumb there as well.
NEUT8|If I didn't mention that the YouTube algorithm is picking up on the channel.
BULL9|Thanks for you guys.
NEUT10|Thank you.
NEUT11|Let's go and dive into this chart.
NEUT12|Make this a quick video.
NEUT13|Yeah, let's not waste time is to have right into the charts here show.
NEUT14|Alright, so today is February the 2nd 2021 and the previous close.
NEUT15|The man God is going to be $3.84.
BULL16|It's up approximately 5.2% for the day.
NEUT17|For those of you who did participate in this market and did not use what we said is financial advice and of course entered it according to your strategy, because we have to emphasize that more on the channel guys implement your strategy, execute your strategy, your predetermined strategy that you determined before you hit that buy button, that's market entry, market exit, and stop loss before you step on that exchange and hit that buy button.
NEUT18|Let's continue our price target on mankind as long as it stays above.
NEUT19|$3.31 is likely going to go all the way to, and possibly through the $6.36 level.
NEUT20|OK, it's been our price target for ages.
NEUT21|OK, so for those of you who have held strong through this and potentially still holding your assets there, it's likely it's going to $6.36.
NEUT22|I'm not sure how long it would take.
NEUT23|I mean, we're just starting a new month here, so if it didn't take longer than 30 days, I mean that would be a shocker to me, right?
NEUT24|So that's what we're looking forward to.
NEUT25|Let's do a really quick percentage.
NEUT26|This isn't a video indicating that is time to buy mankind.
NEUT27|Please understand that's not what my intentions are on this video, but from the current level up to $6.36 is going to be a 64% move to the upside.
BULL28|OK, so I just wanted to let you guys know everything is looking really good with mankind as long as it stays above that level that we've said like like I don't know how many times.
BEAR29|$3.31 If the sellers cannot compromise that level, then this is an official break out to the upside.
NEUT30|That's it guys, hopefully enjoy that leaving appropriate thumb just below the video there.
NEUT31|If you enjoy the content, leave a comment.
NEUT32|Let me know if you guys have actually held through these this.
BEAR33|This area right here was actually pretty tough on be honest for the buyers because we actually wouldn't recommend, but we were saying yeah, we were adding to our position as a price came down to about like $3 and not sure how much it was but actually went lower like homestead like $3.
BEAR34|Like yeah lot of investors were getting a little bit antsy.
NEUT35|Like maybe this guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
NEUT36|I'm outta here and they probably sold their positions off, but either way I mean.
NEUT37|Remember guys, get rid of this mindset that you missed out on anything.
NEUT38|Please have an abundant mindset as if you would always have a next opportunity.
NEUT39|OK, there's no such thing as missing out on a plate.
NEUT40|There's a million more than millions actually of other plays waiting on you to do your research.
NEUT41|Execute your strategy and follow through with your strategy, yeah?
NEUT42|Pretty much, I say guys there's no such thing as miss out on an opportunity here with us guys.
NEUT43|OK, let's develop a abundant mindset in the twice.
NEUT44|Alright, let's cut it out here.
