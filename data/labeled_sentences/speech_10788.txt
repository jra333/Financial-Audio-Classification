NEUT0|"""Well, let's take the Apple stock we can see here today."
NEUT1|It has formed a small right kind of distracting and adjust the seat above the first year.
NEUT2|My line, but still below 2 year.
NEUT3|My last email is hung above.
BEAR4|That means even though in short term it has some strengths, but emitter, we're still in bear market vacancy.
BEAR5|The volume here is very low, so it's not enough to push it back up.
BEAR6|It's very likely for it to drop down further to retest the first supporting level that 120.
BULL7|"Thank you."""
