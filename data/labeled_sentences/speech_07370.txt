NEUT0|"""It's clear this via video chart on ticker symbol UAL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, a very very interesting chart headed into next week.
NEUT5|I myself will definitely be watching it closely and I'm going to map out a couple of levels that I think a lot of other traders will be watching, including myself and I make that point about a lot of other traders is because when you can locate those areas that a lot of the other traders are watching and you know you know that a bunch of people are thinking the same thing, call those events self fulfilling prophecies or whatever you want.
NEUT6|It can definitely produce some very dynamic movements, and the first level here that a whole lot of people are going to be watching going into Monday and early next week is right here at 3350.
NEUT7|I mean, let's just take a quick look down memory Lane here.
NEUT8|You can see that level acted as support.
NEUT9|The price bounce pulled all the way back here and once again the price bounced right from that level, but it's a double whammy now because basically at the exact same value of that support level you also now have that pink line which is hard to see 'cause it's behind a couple other lines, but the value of that pink line, that 200.
NEUT10|Moving average on my chart is that basically $33.50.
NEUT11|So more of the story here is that's an area of support that a lot of people will be watching an not a guarantee those don't exist.
NEUT12|But my point is, it's a more than valid thought to have that if the price can work its way down to that level.
BEAR13|And get the break up, but that could very well create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
NEUT14|So 3350 like is that going to be level that I'm watching with?
NEUT15|I'm sure plenty of other people and in the event that level does not quite hold up.
NEUT16|And starts to move to the downside at that point.
NEUT17|Would it be shocking Alessia Price potentially get down to right around that 3225 Mark?
NEUT18|Now in the event the prices just decides it wants to start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT19|First key area of resistance to watch from that angle of things is right up there at $34.50 and then after 3450 next key level up there on that makes it easy at 3550.
NEUT20|So 34 fifty 3550 next couple of key battlegrounds with any sort of attempted movement upwards.
BULL21|But yeah, definitely.
NEUT22|I think a lot of eyeballs going to be watching this one on Monday.
NEUT23|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT24|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT25|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL26|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird.
NEUT28|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT29|But in a cruel way.
BEAR30|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT33|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT35|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
