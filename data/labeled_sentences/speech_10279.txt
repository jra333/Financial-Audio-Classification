BULL0|"""As the indications for door dash open kept climbing and climbing ever higher, never hire, no doubt."
NEUT1|Fueled by over exuberant fires, the image of my Jenga tower just kept dancing in my head.
BEAR2|I mean, it's remarkable borderline miraculous run for the broader market.
BEAR3|A piece had been pulled that sent a big chunk of the thing tumbling down.
BEAR4|It gets worse tomorrow.
BULL5|Airbnb becomes public, and a deal that could potentially be bigger than DoorDash.
NEUT6|We have to hope that the rest of the Jenga tower doesn't fall.
NEUT7|But there's a reason I'm always warning about the danger of big IPO's to the rest of the market, right?
NEUT8|So what's going on here?
BEAR9|Has the younger cohort finally decided that they just gotten way too exuberant, or did they just buy Gord Ash at the opening using market orders, forcing them to sell something else to pay for it when the price came in higher than expected?
NEUT10|I actually that actually we see that we couldn't see the same thing tomorrow and that would produce 2 back to back.
BEAR11|Really ugly days.
NEUT12|Bring out a lot of bears.
NEUT13|Remember how the market got slammed in September?
NEUT14|If the last wave red hot IPOs like Snowflake.
NEUT15|By the way, I couldn't find snowflakes name in the Jenga game.
NEUT16|Ha, we've got door dash.
NEUT17|And then we've got Air BNB oh, and then there's the Robin who deal right around the corner.
BEAR18|Three Jenga towers and then three collapses.
NEUT19|Can the market handle it?
NEUT20|Oh, maybe it's just a game.
NEUT21|First off, I don't think this will say the bull market, no.
NEUT22|I mean, even if it weighs us down for a few days, yes, it's true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe they were far higher than they thought they should have paid with a market order, you never know what price you're going to get, which is why I always try to use Blender sometimes.
NEUT23|Just gotta take a pass with a limit order.
NEUT24|The transaction won't go through if the price goes beyond the level you're comfortable with.
