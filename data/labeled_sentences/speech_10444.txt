NEUT0|"""However, let's take the Apple stock."
BEAR1|We can see Apple has sharply drop after the opening of the market.
BEAR2|So it's bearish sign for the Apple stock.
NEUT3|If we change a chart into daily chart.
NEUT4|We can see here we got a final confirmation of the red candle.
NEUT5|It's a burial site.
NEUT6|The two year my line nearly.
NEUT7|Make a dead cross so it's still bearish.
BULL8|But emitter, we're still above the supporting level.
NEUT9|Here is the bottom of this level.
BULL10|The bottom of this candle is the current final support, so as long as we keep it above here, that means we're still in US consolidation area even though we have dropped the day with a nearly death cross.
BEAR11|And if we check the volume, we can see the volume is low.
BULL12|There's not too much distribution, so it's still healthy.
BULL13|"Thank you."""
