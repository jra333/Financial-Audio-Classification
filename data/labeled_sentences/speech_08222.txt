NEUT0|"""It's calling this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a rough day on this one with the pullback here actually started off very very impressively with the gap up, but then totally just rolled right back over up.
NEUT5|So definitely updates here.
NEUT6|Need to be made from the the annotations that I made on.
NEUT7|Monday, but the first update is just based on a foundational in charge in which states when levels of support are broken and closed below, they tend to act as resistance.
NEUT8|So firstly, level now to keep an eye on that you could throw this right to a textbook.
NEUT9|I mean this played out perfectly, but going in the day right around one 2675 give or take a little bit was that area of support, but then the price fell down below it right?
BEAR10|There you can see afternoon try to bounce upwards but surprise surprise right there got rejected from it and back down it went.
NEUT11|So I'm not saying that the price could never ever break above that level.
NEUT12|I'm just saying that moving forward if the price does consolidate out and then it works its way back upwards.
NEUT13|No, that'll be the big question mark in terms of, you know, can the price at least break above there and stay above that level?
NEUT14|So resistance wise, definitely going to keep a close eye on that and then from the overarching standpoint, continue to watch that pink line up there.
NEUT15|That 200.
NEUT16|Moving average.
NEUT17|But as of right now, that level is pretty irrelevant because First off the price just needs to get up above that initial red line.
NEUT18|Now as far as levels of support concern.
NEUT19|Main level to watch moving forward all about that Purple line right there.
NEUT20|The 50.
NEUT21|Moving average which is currently valid will just call it one 2450 so that will be an important area that you want to see the price hold above.
NEUT22|If this pullback continues, so those would be the main touching levels to watch your moving into Wednesday, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT23|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT24|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT25|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL26|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT28|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR29|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT30|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT31|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT33|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT34|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT35|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note.
NEUT36|Is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT37|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT38|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
