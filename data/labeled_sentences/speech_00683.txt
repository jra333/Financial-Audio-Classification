NEUT0|"""Welcome to the video."
NEUT1|Everyone in today's video will be looking at the crypto currency called guard.
NEUT2|I know this will be a quick update video to show you guys where the price may be going in the near future and where we might be expecting a little bit of pull back in the near future.
NEUT3|So in my last video I gave this so the ultimate target for Cardano is $3.85 for now.
BEAR4|And I said we may be expecting some pullbacks around these fibbonaci levels.
NEUT5|So if we have a look at the first profit target, here it is $1.51.
BEAR6|And if we have a look at the price here, we can see that we're getting pretty close to this level, so we may be seeing some pullback from this level, so this is not a guarantee that we will see a pullback from here, but through historical data we know that price likes to pull back from one of these febra Nachi levels.
NEUT7|So what you may want to do is maybe sell around 5% very small amount around here.
NEUT8|So if the price does dip you can buy back at a discount.
NEUT9|If you are planning to hold this talk long term and you don't want to be constantly buying and selling.
NEUT10|Then you don't have to do this because ultimately Cortana should be going to the free two $4 mark.
NEUT11|But if you are the type of person that wants to sell a little bit and buy back at a discount, then this might be useful for you.
NEUT12|So if you haven't got into this crypto currency or you want to get into this crypto currency, then the best way to do it wouldn't be to buy right now.
NEUT13|It would be to buy when the price starts to dip.
NEUT14|And when we start seeing the price slow down a little bit here.
BEAR15|Because right now it is growing very fast when we see the growth starting to slow down and a little bit of pullback happening, we can predict where the pullback might be going down to.
NEUT16|So when that does start to happen or make a update video to show you guys the best prices to buy this cryptocurrency at top.
