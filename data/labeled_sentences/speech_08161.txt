BEAR0|"""Give me yelling."
NEUT1|Like I am now, but Instagram influencers and Facebook.
NEUT2|You know that this is the time because I know back to my opening rant, even if all of you do it great, it's not going to come out of me and what I get in return is your email that I get 50 times a day.
NEUT3|Which is I did something nice for you and your life is different.
NEUT4|This is the time, so I would do both.
NEUT5|But to your point, real quick anybody selling **** back to supernova, Instagram.
NEUT6|Selling hasn't even started when I think about the sheer amount of fashion that is going to be sold through Instagram when the shop integration is real seamless and lacks friction.
NEUT7|This is why I continue to buy Facebook stock.
NEUT8|Do you know how much money Facebook is going to make when they take a rack off the top?
NEUT9|Of every transaction sold of every fashion product sold on Instagram.
NEUT10|Money.
NEUT11|Hands up.
NEUT12|I had Johnny.
NEUT13|I saw Jenny.
NEUT14|So I've seen a lot of success, but how do you pass the measure success?
NEUT15|Or what does going to success look like to you as Gary mentioned?
NEUT16|Actually this one I understand pretty well.
NEUT17|Do I wake up in the morning and have complete control emotionally and financially around every single action I'm about to take?
NEUT18|That's the best.
NEUT19|The best.
NEUT20|Like I do whatever the **** I want every day, which means there's another thing people don't look at it one way you know what else it means.
NEUT21|It means everything bad that's happening to you is on you which makes you feel in control which makes you happy.
NEUT22|So I keep telling everybody I love my losses.
NEUT23|There my else.
NEUT24|The personal responsibility 100% when you start realizing that Brexit or retaining or ******* Trump or Obama or Facebook or Instagram don't control you.
NEUT25|"**** gets real interesting when you start realizing the answer to everything is and what?"""
