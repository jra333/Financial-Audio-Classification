NEUT1|Pippa Stevens is here to take us through some of the big winners and of course clean energy has been a huge huge focus for many investors Pippa.
BULL2|Hey Don, good morning, that's right.
BULL3|Clean energy coming off a record 2020 both in terms of performance as well as investor interests and that momentum showing no signs of slowing down and falling costs.
NEUT4|Greater adoption, ESG investing among the driving factors here and then.
NEUT5|Of course, President Biden on day one he re entered the US into the Paris climate agreement, really setting the stage for clean energy to be a priority throughout his administration.
NEUT6|So getting down to some of the specifics and some of the top.
BULL7|Out performers take a look at shares of SunPower, the residential home solar installer up 35% this week 69% this year, when blade manufacturer TPI Composites rising 11% this week 30% this year.
NEUT8|And then you can't really talk about the surge in clean energy without touching on the fuel cell stocks.
BEAR9|So plug power really a quite a volatile stock here.
BULL10|It's been known to swing heavily in either direction, but shares of Plug power up nearly 90% this year.
NEUT11|As investors bet that hydrogen fuel cells are really the future Dom, even if it's still a few years away at this point.
BULL12|Pippa, it's a 79% run for Plug Power on a year to date basis.
NEUT13|We're three weeks into the year.
NEUT14|Given how much these types of stocks are up in terms of valuations, how are they looking?
NEUT15|Is there really that much more upside ahead?
NEUT16|It seems as though the risk reward at this stage tilts more towards maybe downside, right?
BULL17|Yeah, that's a great point, and there are certainly certainly a lot of investors saying after this big run, higher valuations really do look stretched.
BEAR18|You know I spoke to one investment manager the other day who said that he foresees a pullback coming.
BULL19|And he mentioned that he didn't expect these stocks to rise more than 200% last year.
NEUT20|And he doesn't really forecast that type of return for this year.
BULL21|That said, he remains optimistic on the space, and there's still plenty of value to be had, according to Wall Street analysts.
BULL22|So this week, for instance, JP Morgan reiterated its overweight rating on shares of.
NEUT23|Sunrun and cynova.
BULL24|The firm thinks that continued adoption of solar across the US will continue to drive these stocks higher.
NEUT25|Also this week, Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on Solaredge.
NEUT26|The company makes inverters which are commonly referred to as the brains of a solar system.
BULL27|Morgan Stanley said Solar Edge has a wide economic Moat and that it's gaining market share in a rapidly growing space.
NEUT28|And then finally truest initiating coverage on Enphase Energy with a buy rating and phase, of course, joins the S&P 500.
NEUT29|Earlier this month, it's the first pureplay solar name to be added to the benchmark index.
NEUT30|So really, a vote of confidence.
