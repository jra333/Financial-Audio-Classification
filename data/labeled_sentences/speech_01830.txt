NEUT0|"""Black boss here, folks today we're going to be talking about margin debt balances, stock market bubbles, and I'll be finishing up with a few companies on my radar for a market sell off."
NEUT1|So what is a margin debt balance, folks?
NEUT2|Well, what that means is it's basically when folks open a brokerage account, you have the option where you can take out a loan from your brokerage for investing in the stock market.
BEAR3|So using borrowed money to buy stocks, and that can be very dangerous when markets sell off because your margin debt balance decreases your brokerage account and call you and be like, hey, we're going to need you to contribute.
NEUT4|A few $1000 to your margin account to get it back up to where we'd like to see it, and you might have a hard time coming up with that money, so let's look at margin debt balances.
NEUT5|I'd created this chart for you all here and this shows margin debt balances overtime.
NEUT6|And so as you can see, in April 2013, we set an all time high of $384 billion.
NEUT7|But that does not tell the whole story.
NEUT8|Folks, we have to adjust that amount for inflation over time because previous debt balances are in yesterday's dollars and we need to put those in today's dollars.
BULL9|So we're going to inflate those by two point 4%.
NEUT10|That's the average rate of inflation.
NEUT11|From 1997 to now and so, as you can see, the new high was set back in the housing bubble around 2 June 2007 and that was around $438 billion.
NEUT12|So today's balances are still 14% below those margins, debt, debt, high set back in the housing bubble era, and so they are equal with the tech bubble, though as you can see from the chart, so moving on the moral of the story here is this data can't be used as a predictor and should not attempt to be used that with high margin.
NEUT13|Balances do not cause market crashes and this data shouldn't be used to time the market.
NEUT14|It's rather a wake up call to be aware of the amount of speculation in today's marketplace.
BULL15|That being said, it's proving to be especially difficult to find good bargains at today's prices, and this is the perfect opportunity to get that wish list ready.
NEUT16|Get that list of companies you want to buy on the market, sell off their little too expensive today that you would love to get it a cheaper price.
NEUT17|So I have a little wish.
NEUT18|Listen today.
NEUT19|I want to focus on media companies that specialize in producing content companies like Disney and Time Warner for example.
NEUT20|So we can look at some data from the Nielsen.
BULL21|Institute here and so as you can see, TV viewing hours has increased overtime in traditional TV viewing has slightly outpaced inflation since 2008, but as you can see, Internet viewing has skyrocketed up 279% since 2008, or 26% per year.
NEUT22|I found this especially interesting because you think Internet would steal share away from traditional TV.
BULL23|But 93% of media consumption is still done through traditional TV and DVR and has actually increased over that time period did not last viewing hours.
BULL24|And so this moves us on to those content production companies there exhibiting great pricing power in the marketplace due to increasing global media consumption and increasing demand from distribution services like Dish Network and Netflix for example.
NEUT25|So as you can see, content is King here and that's why I especially like Disney and Time Warner and why they're on my wish list.
BEAR26|I'm just not willing to pull the trigger at today's prices.
BULL27|I might miss out in the short term, but in the long term, I think I can get in a better price than today.
NEUT28|So that's all I had to say about the stock market margin balances.
NEUT29|In a few companies in my wish list, be sure to check back with pool com.
BULL30|"Thanks for watching and full on."""
