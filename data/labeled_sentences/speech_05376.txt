NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol NAK."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|So if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day today, not only from the price action POV, but you look down here at the volume and this is all occurring on well above average volume, so very very rough day.
NEUT5|But now going forward from a trading standpoint.
NEUT6|Certainly an interesting setup taking place there and the first key point that's really interesting and stands out is right down there at $0.38.
NEUT7|Not once, but twice.
BEAR8|Actually the price went down in that area.
BEAR9|Anna give credit where credits do the Bulls held strong and the price was not able to go below that level, which suggests that maybe this is some sort of bottom that's forming and now don't get me wrong, I really.
NEUT10|Really wish I could say trade was easy.
NEUT11|Just because the prices bounced a couple times off 38 does not mean that for sure.
BEAR12|Guaranteed this is the bottom.
NEUT13|My point is it's at least a logical thought to have case in point, let's say that the price never bounced off 38 once and it was still just trending trending downwards and I'm sitting here saying hey it's looking like 38.
NEUT14|Could be the bottom would be totally justified to say what are you talking about based on what.
BEAR15|But in this situation it actually has bounced off there a couple of times.
NEUT16|So again, does that mean it's for sure the bottom no?
NEUT17|Does that mean it's at least a valid rational thought to have absolutely so $0.38?
NEUT18|Very, very important level of support going forward, not only from the trading standpoint, but if you just look at it from an overall charting standpoint.
BEAR19|If the price does not hold above 38 then that would literally just be putting the price that even lower lows that have not been seen for a very very long time now in the event.
NEUT20|Let's say this is some sort of bottom and the price starts the bounds.
NEUT21|Let's talk about some potential areas of resistance.
BULL22|Initial area resistance.
NEUT23|Give me right there at the 40 cent mark, the $0.40 can be broken.
NEUT24|The next key battleground after that is right up there at the 41 cent area and 41 cents is important and interesting because if the price were to break below you know, excuse me up above there.
NEUT25|Not saying it shoots straight up, but I mean really things begin to space out quite a bit because of that gap down.
BULL26|So 41 definitely becomes a very interesting breakout point if the price can get a movement back to the upside.
NEUT27|So let's see what happens with it.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
