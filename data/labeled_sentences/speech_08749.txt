NEUT9|And is likely to stay in the channel between 58 and 63 U.S. dollars.
BEAR10|Falling oil prices put pressure on the Russian assets, including the ruble.
BEAR11|What's more, rising tensions between Russia and the US make the situation even more difficult for the ruble.
NEUT12|For instance, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia was planning to gradually move away from the US dollar and Western controlled international payment systems.

BEAR30|However, the employment rate in the US.
BEAR31|Has suddenly decreased in recent weeks, while the number of unemployed reached four point 1,000,000 people.
