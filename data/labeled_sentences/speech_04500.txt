BULL0|"""Welcome back and thank you for watching."
NEUT1|This is going to be another stock analysis view with an LC capital Biogen ticker symbol BIB.
NEUT2|We're going to be looking at the 90 day one hour chart.
NEUT3|And trying to get a better picture of the near term.
NEUT4|Price.
NEUT5|Price movement.
NEUT6|So, to start, let's talk about the resistance.
NEUT7|That Biogen is trading there.
BULL8|So you have strong resistance at that 9205 level, multiple test.
NEUT9|The high is 9269, so it's not too far from.
BULL10|Weather resistance sets.
NEUT11|Moving towards the near term OK. You have this this gap.
NEUT12|That there was obviously.
NEUT13|Broken made a nice little Cup.
NEUT14|Pattern.
NEUT15|And now you gapped up and you're you're in this recent consolidation period where prices just consolidating and most likely prepping itself for a move higher.
NEUT16|Just looking at at the bigger picture.
NEUT17|What we think you can see happen is this is going to end up being a couple of Cup and handle pattern OK. After this completes, you will most likely see a pop above this resistance line.
NEUT18|It will trade above $292.00.
NEUT19|And it will most likely tell up to 300 if we pull up the daily.
NEUT20|A decent price target for this is probably 310 near term.
NEUT21|We do think that you'll see this this pop on the daily.
BULL22|It is a little overbought but there's still a lot of momentum and as you can see the Mac D is trading above its.
BULL23|Nearterm recent high.
NEUT24|Pulling back up that 90 day one hour chart.
BULL25|You can see that we dig into over overbought territory after we reported earnings.
BEAR26|But then we kind of tailed off on our side as we consolidate sideways.
NEUT27|Same thing happened on the Mac D and the Mac D is looking like it's.
BULL28|Gaining some momentum.
BULL29|So this is good.
BULL30|This is a good sign by B.
BULL31|We're definitely looking for a bullish move near term.
BULL32|Reported fantastic earnings an.
BEAR33|They reported fantastic earnings and stock is prepping itself.
NEUT34|Remove hard technically.
