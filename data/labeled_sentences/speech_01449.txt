NEUT0|"""How many times can runs price really multiply?"
NEUT1|In this video, we're going to go over just that.
NEUT2|We're going to go over the chart and we're setting a price.
NEUT3|Target Run is currently sitting at 0.62 U.S. dollars.
BULL4|The August high of 0.58 U.S. dollars has now become the support level, and I can see a good buying opportunity as Ron retest the support level that was the previous all time high.
NEUT5|We're going to be setting a price target a bit later on guys, but first, let's head to the fundamentals.
NEUT6|Run has a market cap of 545 million at 24 hour trading volume of 104 million.
NEUT7|Circulating supply of 881,000,000 and the maximum supply of 1 billion.
NEUT8|So RAM protocol is a permissionless and trustless protocol that allows users to transfer tokens across different blockchains, drain score, product there and virtual machine is focused on building an interoperability solution for decentralized finance.
NEUT9|Oren tokens are used to operate dark nodes which functions similarly to validator nodes on a proof of stake blockchain.
NEUT10|So to run a dark mode you would need 100,000 rent as collateral and the people who are under dark nodes earn a portion of the transaction fees collected during the swap from one cryptocurrency.
NEUT11|To another, so the major use case for rent is to offer liquidity to the Ethereum network and device sector.
BEAR12|There are lots of Bitcoin sitting around and users wallets and not earning any returns.
NEUT13|Andrew and they can be used in a wide selection of defy applications on Ethereum, like lending, borrowing and trading.
NEUT14|OK guys, we're going to get to our price target soon, but first let's head to the rest of the market.
BULL15|If you mess up 10% today, it is currently at 1155 U.S. dollars and it seems it will be retesting its resistance level which was the 2018 peak Bitcoin is consolidating at the Thirty 1800 level.
NEUT16|And it seems that slowly but surely it will be retesting the support level at the 30,000 level units.
BULL17|Warp is doing exceedingly well.
BULL18|It's up 21% today and is currently at 11.3 U.S. dollars.
BULL19|The units Wapiti relation with the 11% and seems to be retesting its previous resistance at the 0.086 level and chaining a stabilizing at the 24.3 U.S. dollar level.
BULL20|OK the top three gainers over the past 24 hours are there if Adele up 45.4% units were up 19.6% and one inch up 18.4%.
BULL21|Getting back to the rank chart, I can see significant upside foreign coin given that it has a small market cap of 545 million.
NEUT22|I would say that at the peak of the altcoin cycle a market cap of 2.5 billion is reasonable and that will give ran a price of three U.S. dollars.
BEAR23|In this article on currentdesk.com, we say that institutions have been buying Bitcoin in spite of the retrace.
BULL24|In fact, the number of words with 1000 Bitcoin or more have continued to increase this week.
BULL25|OK guys, I hope you learn something new from this video.
