BULL0|"""Cheers markets saying a 30% chance of a 25 basis cut."
NEUT1|Reduction by the end of July and a full 25 by year end and then you get maybe a little bit of cuts next year.
NEUT2|It's a fine tuning.
BEAR3|I generally agree with that because inflation is not an issue and we are losing some momentum.
NEUT4|On the gross number.
NEUT5|So yes, it makes sense to me.
NEUT6|This view though that was put forth on Friday by.
BEAR7|The data was little better today.
NEUT8|I want to call the White House and that's where they think they ought to do the data.
NEUT9|Yeah, OK, still 50.
NEUT10|OK our number.
BEAR11|So yeah, they're running out of the White House.
NEUT12|I thought the point of you put forth on Friday was nothing short of stunning in that the economy is doing great.
BULL13|President says it's the best economy we've ever had.
BEAR14|The stock market is, as I said, now 80 points away from a new all time high.
NEUT15|But just in case we need to immediately cut interest rates by.
NEUT16|50 basis points.
NEUT17|What do you make of that?
NEUT18|I'm a little speechless on this one, Scott.
NEUT19|And when this first happened I said that it should be nipped in the Bud right now because it's a slippery slope.
NEUT20|And where does the slippery slope lead to?
NEUT21|It leads to the pit and now we're sort of like deep in the pit of the White House, essentially trying to run Federal Reserve policy, and I think about what is conservatism?
NEUT22|Conservatism sort of starts with the idea of things were a certain way before and before we change them.
NEUT23|We should think about why they are the way they are and.
NEUT24|There's a reason why we didn't have presidents running 'cause right now.
NEUT25|What I'm concerned about is that the market gets confused that the market.
NEUT26|Here's the president and the White House talking about cutting rates and they no longer know what animates the Fed and why they're going to do what they're going to do.
NEUT27|Look, that may be the right call.
NEUT28|But shut up about it.
BEAR29|It's been a bridge too far gone too far.
NEUT30|No?
NEUT31|I'm calling for the Fed to make these these moves.
NEUT32|No, I mean if you think it's perfectly OK, Joe for the for the White House economic adviser to say cut 50 basis points now.
NEUT33|Absolutely I don't look the Fed is not above criticism, affect fed invited.
BEAR34|A lot of criticism, find itself and it confusing markets.
BEAR35|The we had this conversation when Powell did terrible job communicating late last year and they fixed it.
NEUT36|But if you look at the change in rates from the trough we talked about the shadow rate.
BEAR37|The Fed has gone significantly and the yield curve is very flat.
NEUT38|In the US is a very much a high yield are among the G20.
BEAR39|So yes, rate should be lower.
NEUT40|The irony the irony of different show.
NEUT41|The irony of having different parts in the market.
NEUT42|It's different from letting the people you appointed to do something in an independent way.
NEUT43|Get there on their own.
NEUT44|Is there any doubt that the Fed would have stopped hiking if the president hadn't said one word?
NEUT45|Sure, but I'm really.
NEUT46|I'm saying the fundamentals.
BEAR47|Would argue for them to cut, so I don't know.
NEUT48|I'm I'm I'm.
NEUT49|"I'm sort of with you on that, or maybe either way to different debate from the White House running fed policy."""
