NEUT0|"""Are you gonna be taking a look at stock ticker symbol TWTR?"
NEUT1|That's going to be for Twitter right now.
NEUT2|Currently trade at 1859 were over here on investorshangout.com.
NEUT3|Taking a look at the buy rating on investorshangout.com right now.
NEUT4|Currently at a moderate.
NEUT5|Sell it with 24 analysis reporting.
NEUT6|376 is going to be for the average recommendation for the top right here.
NEUT7|We've got 14 so remember 14 out of the 24 have a hold on this and 9:00 if strong sell.
NEUT8|And then one of moderate sell.
NEUT9|This is why you can't always go off of this stuff right here.
NEUT10|Why?
NEUT11|Because, look at what's going on right now.
NEUT12|Now this is a few things I was going to be watching for here with Twitter.
NEUT13|The last time we went over this one is going to be back in February.
NEUT14|Back in February, the last time we went over this boom right there, 1858 right now blowing through the 1830 area that would have been a huge level resistance level broke through it today.
NEUT15|Getting that momentum back into this one.
NEUT16|I'm going to be watching for that break of the 19.
NEUT17|I think that Twitter right now.
NEUT18|At 1856, is going to make make that trend up to the $1919 area.
NEUT19|Off of that, you're going to be the next stop would be much higher, roughly $20.
NEUT20|Even we can put that in there right there just to hold this trend where you're currently at right now.
BULL21|1748 is going to be the area that would want to see hold here, but Twitter really coming alive, breaking you guys through those levels that we were at before.
BULL22|I think that now you guys are going to see a huge rally coming behind Twitter again.
NEUT23|Kind of blows at this stuff right out the window of the matter itself.
NEUT24|24 analysis reporting.
NEUT25|Again, that's why I said the charts play a big role in this guys.
NEUT26|You can sit there going through the company all you want.
NEUT27|But it's going to be coming out between the chart.
NEUT28|The chart is going to basically tell you the story of what's going on with the price action 1830 blew through making your way up to $19.00.
BULL29|I wouldn't be shocked if we've seen that here within the next day or 219 break would bring you guys up to $20 on the resistance level 1748 on the support will need to hold right there.
NEUT30|I think that we're going to have another support at $18.00 as well, so let's go ahead and add in our date here at 1012 current price at 1858 resistance level.
NEUT31|$19.00 is going to be a level that I watch in $20 support levels right now, currently at 1830.
NEUT32|That's where we just blew past.
NEUT33|It was going to be leveled, watching and then followed up by that $18.00 even and then the following at 1748.
NEUT34|Right there, resistance at 19 and 20 supported 1830 and eighteen 1748 in my opinion.
NEUT35|This will continue.
BULL36|To rally.
NEUT37|Here for a few days I think this could really up to $19.00.
NEUT38|We're gonna be watching it.
