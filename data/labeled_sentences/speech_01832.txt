NEUT0|"""So I'm going to be going over the Neo crypto coin in talking about if it's possible for this coin to ever hit $1000."
NEUT1|Now if you want to check this coin out, it's currently available on a couple of exchanges.
NEUT2|E Toro Crypto has it's going to be breaking it down here, and if you want to check out the Toro Crypto, definitely recommend it.
NEUT3|I've been using it now for the last two or three months of some resource.
NEUT4|Sign up in bonus links in both the description and comments of this video.
NEUT5|OK, but more importantly, Neo, uh, you know, the coin is known as the Chinese Ethereum killer.
NEUT6|It's been around since 2000.
BULL7|14 its all time high.
NEUT8|This coin was $196.00, so that's the highest it's ever gone.
BULL9|You know if you pull it up on the one year here you can see that you know it's up a little bit.
NEUT10|It's been between like 14 and $25 in the last few months, so that's kind of the price range it's been in now.
NEUT11|I think that if you can get Neo under 20 bucks, it's a great coin to get and hold on to.
NEUT12|You know for the next year to three years.
NEUT13|And I'll explain my thinking on that shortly.
NEUT14|But you know, I do also want to pull it up.
NEUT15|Quickly here on Coinmarketcap to really show you where it's at, but it's in the top 30 coins right now.
NEUT16|It's been it's been in the top 20, I think it's number 21 right now.
NEUT17|Something like that.
NEUT18|So I mean, it's definitely in there, but if you've researched this coin a little bit or when you research it, you're going to see that they've made a lot of progress with regulations in the you know China and Asia, and that's what it really all comes down to.
BULL19|If this coin becomes more and more adopted over time, the price on it will definitely go up and.
NEUT20|You know from checking out some different price predictions, you know for this coin for 2021 specifically, I've seen people threw out some crazy numbers.
NEUT21|You know, I've seen people say it's going to go up to 300 bucks.
NEUT22|I've seen some people say it's going to go up to, you, know, 500 some people have said 100, but you know, for me personally where I think this coin could go, and I feel like you know, OK, saying it, it's not like financial advice, but in 2021, you know, as long as a lot of the other altcoins start to, you know, go on a bull run and start to move up.
NEUT23|I think we could see Neo get anywhere from like 50 to 100 bucks.
NEUT24|I mean, why not?
NEUT25|You know it's it's a top altcoin.
NEUT26|You know it's in the top 30.
BULL27|Could definitely get in the top 20 again, you know in no time and you know, I definitely think that it could get up to that $100 price point again.
NEUT28|But if we're talking about $1000 Neo, you know?
NEUT29|I mean, it's possible.
NEUT30|I just don't think it's going to happen anytime soon.
NEUT31|If it did, you know it could be like 5-10 years down the road, you know, so you know.
BULL32|But for 2021, you know I definitely get back up to 100 bucks for sure.
BULL33|If you can get this coin under $20 and like I said you're willing to hold on to it for you know the next six months to a year to three years, then you know I just definitely see it going up in value for sure.
BULL34|Anyways, hope you guys enjoyed this.
