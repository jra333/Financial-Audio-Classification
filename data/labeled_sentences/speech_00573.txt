NEUT0|"""Promo video for stock Trade Calculator pro."
NEUT1|We have a chart of Microsoft here.
NEUT2|This Calculator is meant to be used with the 2% rule that traders use.
NEUT3|Over here on Investopedia.
NEUT4|Haven't really good reason for why you use the 2% rule.
NEUT5|If.
BEAR6|You lose 25% of your account.
BEAR7|You have to make 33% back in order to restore it to the original amount, and that it gets worse and worse.
NEUT8|If you lose 50%, you gotta make 100% return 75%, four, 100% return.
NEUT9|At that point, you were basically blown out your account and you can't recover.
NEUT10|So you gotta use 2% rule.
NEUT11|Come here too.
NEUT12|We are with stock trade Calculator pro screen.
NEUT13|Here I am with with Microsoft and I'm thinking I want to go along.
NEUT14|You can go shorter.
NEUT15|You can calculate long or short trades with this Calculator.
NEUT16|I'm going to calculate along trade.
NEUT17|In the prices, well, first of all you first want to do is is find.
NEUT18|2% of your working capital so.
NEUT19|So you had $60,000.
NEUT20|Calculate.
NEUT21|2% of that which is 1200 bucks.
NEUT22|So we got 1200 bucks to risk on this trade, so we're going to go along.
NEUT23|We're going to.
NEUT24|We're going to buy where it is at 3680 first.
NEUT25|First we put in.
NEUT26|How much to risk and we're going to buy it 3680.
NEUT27|An I would, I would say the stop should go.
NEUT28|But right here.
NEUT29|35.25 yeah, and it looks to me like it's just double top or something so.
NEUT30|Well, I put the stuff about the limit at 38 points.
NEUT31|Trade with Scottrade.
NEUT32|$7.00 trades.
BULL33|Scottrade is great.
NEUT34|So here appear it displays the calculations of the data you've used for the calculation.
NEUT35|It says your number of shares to buy seven 766 shares are going to need 28.
NEUT36|$1202.80 for the trade and you're going to make this much money.
NEUT37|If your limit is hit.
NEUT38|Now you can.
NEUT39|You can re enter the data.
NEUT40|If there's a mistake like you.
NEUT41|Forget to enter something the interest cannot be blank.
