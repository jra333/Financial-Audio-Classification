BULL0|"""Welcome back everybody."
NEUT1|Can see is going parabolic guys.
BEAR2|We've been expecting this breakout.
BULL3|We actually broke out off a massive cap with handle here on the weekly time frame.
NEUT4|This was a massive Cup with handle broke out.
NEUT5|Made a bearish.
NEUT6|Pull back OK.
NEUT7|It was a bull back actually, but the nasty pull back and now it's over shooting all the way to 3 point.
BULL8|$3 already hit 3.0.
BULL9|We have resistance here at around 3.5 OK, my expectation guys.
NEUT10|My target for can see this is going nightmare mode.
NEUT11|OK, if you measure the Cup with handle, obviously patient guys.
NEUT12|It's not going to happen in one day, it could, but it's not have to anyway I'm expecting our next target.
NEUT13|The big target is around 5.2 dollar.
NEUT14|This is like the big target for me for KFC.
BULL15|Obviously I'm going to handle it.
NEUT16|I've been buying it here on the accumulation range.
NEUT17|Let me show you the other child.
NEUT18|The BTC chart can see Bitcoin chart.
BULL19|Look at that case if it can start getting very stronger here as well, we get in big volume breakout and we just made a higher high, obviously not confirmed that we need to close this daily candle above 5200 Satoshis.
BULL20|But this look in Burlison looking very good.
BULL21|You can see we took that high.
BULL22|We already making higher highs.
NEUT23|If we can take that high.
NEUT24|OK 61 OK. 6120 fourth.
NEUT25|So she is.
NEUT26|It would probably go Nightmare modes anyway.
