NEUT0|"""OK, so as I understand it, you know."
NEUT1|Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think Avax is.
NEUT2|In a way connected to sort of like polka dot.
NEUT3|On defy maybe.
NEUT4|Or defy polka dot?
NEUT5|Is is somehow connected to how well Avax can do?
NEUT6|OK, you're going to just watch me charted as we.
NEUT7|As we sit here, I'm just looking for something OK, my my inclination to chase something that has already gone up.
NEUT8|I really don't want to do that.
NEUT9|OK, that said, in this particular coin, OK.
NEUT10|If it goes from 2 1/2 to 7 and then it retraces back to say it's old high at 5.
NEUT11|Right, if there's a dip to either 5 or maybe 6.
NEUT12|OK, it may be worth it to take a shot at this coin.
NEUT13|OK, 'cause I watched this thing move, believe it or not, where did I learn about Avax from our private group?
NEUT14|One of the things about our private group is that everyone involved makes each other smarter.
NEUT15|So somebody was talking about Avax.
NEUT16|Someone asked me about the chart.
NEUT17|I looked at the Shard, I'm like, Oh my God, this is going on.
NEUT18|I went on a TV program.
NEUT19|The guy asked me for my number one pick.
BULL20|I told him avax it went up for three days.
NEUT21|Was that because I was a genius?
NEUT22|No, it's because I was a part of a community.
NEUT23|That collectively you know, everybody just makes each other smarter.
NEUT24|So end of token metrics.
NEUT25|Commercial avax January 10th I say buy the dip at either six or five.
NEUT26|Alright, thank you Bill.
NEUT27|"Let us know what you think about avax down below in the comments."""
