BULL0|"""With us now foundation capitals Paul Holland Foundation was an early venture backer of Netflix, Paul, Good to see you."
BULL1|Good to see you Carl.
NEUT2|This is Mike, but let's talk sorry, my Netflix, I can't.
NEUT3|I'm blind.
NEUT4|I can't see the monitor possible no, I got you.
NEUT5|If you talk about Netflix though this decade long window to look at is actually fascinating, right?
NEUT6|That started the decade it was a DVD subscription business for the most part it had to kind of convince the world that people would pay for streaming either instead of or in addition to their pay TV bundle.
NEUT7|Now the company is being cast as a bit of the incumbent that supposed to the innovator.
NEUT8|They have to play defense.
NEUT9|Is that a fair way of thinking about it?
NEUT10|And what is this next phase?
NEUT11|For the company's growth, going to look like.
NEUT12|Well, I think you characterized the history quite Royal.
NEUT13|My partner makes you invested in Netflix back in 1998.
NEUT14|At the time the concept was, you know, we'd like to see large markets.
BULL15|We like to see innovative business models and we like to see fantastic management teams.
NEUT16|It's now 21 years later.
NEUT17|An all of that's been proven out in spades.
NEUT18|One of the top five investments in the history of the tech business as a whole.
NEUT19|And then I'd probably quibble with you about a little bit about the present.
NEUT20|Yeah, though the incumbent, because they've earned the top slot from that perspective, people like Disney took 21 years to respond.
NEUT21|But I think you know if I look at the Business Today, I did a very scientific study yesterday, asked 3 next Gen Gen Z people, a Piper Kylie in Devon Hall and Dan and they came back and said you know Dad, Netflix is a subculture for us like we grew up with it from the very very beginning.
NEUT22|It's a dream brand from a segmentation perspective.
NEUT23|So when you think about kind of where they are in the position they are in the marketplace, it's a trillion dollar marketplace for media.
NEUT24|Their number one and continuing to.
NEUT25|To grow and.
BULL26|So yeah, they've become a giant, but they're still a pretty nimble and effective giant run by, you know, the best management team in the world for my money.
BULL27|But it's interesting part because they are facing more competition here in the US competition, not just for subscribers but also for content, which of course drives up the cost of content empire and then internationally where they seem to be focusing more.
NEUT28|We're seeing them charge less for those subscriptions.
NEUT29|So you sort of have the pressure there in terms of their pricing power.
NEUT30|Where do you think Netflix has the biggest opportunity?
BULL31|When will they be able to grow their US subscriber base anymore?
NEUT32|Or is the future really overseas?
NEUT33|Well, I think you get to a place where you become so large you know you get to wear your reflection of the population at some level.
BULL34|Facebook has gotten to that point as had have other Giants in the field.
BULL35|International certainly represented a huge opportunity in an investment for the company.
NEUT36|For any of us that have worked and lived overseas, you know you have to adjust to what's happening in terms of local pricing in different places, so you can't do sort of 1 size fits all, so it's sort of logical that they would end up going down that path, so I'm not.
BEAR37|Terribly concerned from that perspective.
NEUT38|I think what you have to look at you look back at Netflix.
NEUT39|You know his name, Netflix, not DVD by Mail.
BULL40|It was an innovative company run by some of the best software company developers and engineers I've ever known, and I think as we look forward, we're going to continue to see innovation on the business model.
NEUT41|Some of that you can look at and try to predict, and some of that you can't predict.
BEAR42|But this is a disruptive group that is built out this business and they're not going to rest.
NEUT43|At this point.
NEUT44|"It's still very early days when you think about it from that perspective."""
