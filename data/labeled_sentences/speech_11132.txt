NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock here."
NEUT1|I perform the red candle last Friday.
NEUT2|The good thing is that it's still above the EMA.
NEUT3|We can see here still about the army but the bad thing is that we can see here the during the daytime if we change it to one day we can see that dropped at the closing of the market.
BEAR4|So it means a bearish sign in short term.
NEUT5|But if we change the chart into the weekly chart, we can see here.
NEUT6|Actually.
NEUT7|Apple has formed a Cup pattern.
NEUT8|Why?
NEUT9|Because we can see here.
NEUT10|This is the first Cup.
NEUT11|And then.
NEUT12|Straight up and then drop back.
NEUT13|But here is another Cup here.
BEAR14|We can see this coming week because the volume here is very small compared to here.
NEUT15|So when the volume drop down it means somebody hold the stock and no sale.
NEUT16|But now this volume jump up comparably larger than this one, so it means somebody buying in here.
NEUT17|So on weekly chart we can see this Cup.
NEUT18|Hazard meaning has a bullish meaning for the Apple stock.
NEUT19|But the.
NEUT20|The one thing we should notice is that the Dodi Dodi here has a upper side like, so this means there's still resistance about.
BULL21|So in my opinion, as long as the volume keep trending up there still hope for Apple stock to breakthrough to a new high.
BULL22|"Thank you."""
