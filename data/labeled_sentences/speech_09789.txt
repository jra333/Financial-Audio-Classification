NEUT0|"""Imagine for a moment a world that has everything you could ever dream of."
NEUT1|Need some supplies.
NEUT2|Every kind of story you can imagine.
NEUT3|Is there an open 24/7 want to see a movie or a show millions at your fingertips?
NEUT4|And if you're tired of storms, it never rains there.
NEUT5|Weather is perfect.
NEUT6|So where is this magical place?
NEUT7|It's the Metaverse that's the world.
NEUT8|The gaming company Roblox is trying to create, and they're not alone in the dark is super real Life Ready player.
NEUT9|One sort of experience, but he died.
NEUT10|Melding real and virtual life into one thing.
NEUT11|And it might be right around the corner.
NEUT12|Steve kovach.
NEUT13|Now he's cnbc.com's technology editor, save all of that.
NEUT14|Sounds pretty incredible, but how close is it all to becoming a sort of virtual reality?
NEUT15|In a way, it's already kind of here, ship Roblox, which you just mentioned and went public yesterday.
NEUT16|They already have over 30 million people living in their digital world.
NEUT17|This Metaverse they're building every day now.
NEUT18|It's mostly kids and teens, but they are spending real money and having these hilarious and great interactions with each other in this virtual world.
NEUT19|And that is why people are watching this company so closely.
NEUT20|So it sounds like something that could.
NEUT21|I don't know if it replaces the right word, but supplement social media and all the ways we all communicate now.
NEUT22|And in addition, it's not just Roblox, there are a lot of companies doing this, right?
NEUT23|Exactly, think of it as like Facebook on steroids.
NEUT24|It's a new kind of futuristic way to socialize online today.
NEUT25|We're used to doing it on phones and tablets and computers, but not too far from now.
NEUT26|We're going to have augmented reality and virtual reality headsets from companies like Facebook, Apple, Samsung, Google that lets you really feel immersed in these digital worlds that are being created right now and give you a sense of presence more so than we're having right now remotely.
NEUT27|Imagine if it felt like I was sitting right next to your shop.
NEUT28|Even though I'm not, that's what it's like.
NEUT29|That's creepy, just thinking about it.
NEUT30|But I will say does that mean kids whose first start in this virtual world do those kids then grow up in that world or their avatars grow up to their habits and likes and dislikes grow up?
BULL31|Yeah, that's the real advantage for something like Roblox.
NEUT32|Yes, they have kids captured right now, but the kids are also the ones building this world.
NEUT33|So as they age, the world will evolve with them.
NEUT34|So as their tastes and likes change, they can build the world the way they see fit.
NEUT35|So yes, it seems like a kids game now, but I don't know 1015 years from now when these kids are adults, it's going to be more common.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
