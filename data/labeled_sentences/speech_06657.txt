NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here in excel.com."
NEUT1|Today will be looking at Euro USD on the daily chart so zooming in we can see that Euro USD bears move the pair below the one point 1026 low of August 1st as well as the one point 10 handle which is the 23.6 people natural retracement level of the downlink from one point 1411 to one oh 925.
BEAR2|The price had deflected of the one point 1110 level where the 42 day SMAD merged with the Downtrend line rendering the double bottom pattern obsolete.
BEAR3|While there is amaze suggest a negative outlook, the momentum indicators concur, but traders need to be aware of the tenkan Sen and Ken Johnson lines which have remained flat during this move.
BEAR4|If the Bears revival brings further losses, the pair could fall to test the one or 940.
BULL5|Taking full control of the reins, the 28 month low of one oh 925 already tested twice, could prove to be a more durable barrier prior to the traders attention.
NEUT6|Turning to the May 2017 level of 1.08 ninety.
BULL7|Upwards the Bulls would need to initially overcome the one point 10 hurdle and the one point 1026 resistance.
BEAR8|If buying orders managed to increase the price above the 38.2% Fibonacci of one point 1050, the Bulls could then face their restricting downtrend line.
NEUT9|Presently at one point 1070.
BEAR10|Supposing this, the nearby 42 SMAD, coupled with the 50% fib oh of one point 1087, could apply the pressure ahead of the swing high of one point 1110.
BEAR11|Overall, the short and medium term biases remain negative and a close below one.
NEUT12|Oh 925.
BULL13|Would revive the downward move.
NEUT14|However, an initial break above the downtrend line would be needed to consider a shift in the bias.
NEUT15|That's it for me.
BULL16|"Have a great trading day."""
