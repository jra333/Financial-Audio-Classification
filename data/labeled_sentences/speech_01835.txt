BEAR0|"""So let's shift our focus to Netflix because they were the first mover in this group, but the stock has gotten hit quite a bit with all of this competition that it's facing."
NEUT1|Yeah, technically we don't like Netflix right now.
BEAR2|The stock is trading underneath its 50 day though above its 200.
BULL3|Hopefully the 200 day can act as support for that.
BULL4|It's got a week relative strength right now.
BULL5|The relative strength about 24 on the O'Neill system in the stocks not under accumulation.
BULL6|In addition, the stocks not hitting new highs as the market is.
BEAR7|So it's kind of out of sync with the market right now, and I think the reason for that is is that investors are worried about the Disney entry.
BEAR8|In addition, when they reported their quarter in October, they missed the new sub ads they were supposed to do.
NEUT9|7,000,000 was the guidance.
NEUT10|They added 6.8.
BEAR11|That's a good number, but it is below with their guidance was that's the second quarter in a row.
BEAR12|They've missed their guidance.
NEUT13|Now they have 158 million subscribers worldwide that split about 5050 US versus international, so there's still a dominant player.
BEAR14|But again, they haven't been making the sub numbers and they continue to burn cash.
NEUT15|Netflix spends about $15 billion a year on new content.
BULL16|That's a very strong number.
NEUT17|They spend more on streaming than Disney.
NEUT18|Disney is probably going to spend 2 to 2 1/2 billion.
NEUT19|But remember overall, Disney spends 24 billion, so they have a lot of content there, and Netflix is burning cash.
NEUT20|The estimates for this year for them to burn about 3 1/2 billion.
NEUT21|Disney just finished their fiscal year.
NEUT22|They generated 1.7 billion, so ones, burning cash and ones generating cash long term that could be an issue for Netflix as the cost of content continues to rise exactly and we know that other players are from NBC to HBO.
BULL23|Also ramping up their plans to get into this space.
NEUT24|But one more note on the technicals for Netflix.
NEUT25|You talked about the relative strength rating.
NEUT26|Can you talk about what goes into that?
NEUT27|So that's really analyzing how the stock looks versus the other stocks.
NEUT28|In their markets.
NEUT29|So this in this case in regards to the US market and really stocks that have the best performance, tend to be North of 70 on the relative strength rating.
NEUT30|The thing we always say it O'Neill is right.
NEUT31|You want to own a leader, not a laggard.
BULL32|Netflix has been a laggard until we can see it start to regain positive relative strength versus the market North of 70 and get above that 50 day.
NEUT33|We would really avoid the stock.
NEUT34|Alright.
NEUT35|Well, some interesting thoughts there on this ongoing streaming war.
BULL36|Will definitely keep tabs on it and it looks like we could see some continued upside for Disney.
NEUT37|We think both for Disney and for the market.
BULL38|Alright sounds good.
BULL39|"Thank you so much Randy."""
