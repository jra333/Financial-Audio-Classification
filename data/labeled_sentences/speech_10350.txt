NEUT0|"""First, we want to wish the President first lady."
BULL1|Well, I know that we have seen many people have recovery fast.
BULL2|Some people obviously hospitalised, and the situations are much better.
NEUT3|But he's an at risk age.
NEUT4|I think that the I'm not saying this much.
NEUT5|Do about nothing.
NEUT6|I am saying that people should have a buy list ready.
NEUT7|I don't think that this is going to change things that much.
NEUT8|I don't think it's going to change things with the with the stimulus and less Senator McConnell, who I think is really got all the cards, does something.
BULL9|I think the Senate is convinced that the Republican senators, 20 of them, that we have the shape recovery.
NEUT10|So why are we wasting any money?
NEUT11|I think obviously if you look at the employment report, you'll see that.
BEAR12|I mean there's just staggering number of people who are losing their jobs permanently because the companies are closing.
NEUT13|It was always the idea of the secretary that there should be insurance against that.
BEAR14|19.4 million people reported unable to work, but I don't think the two can be conflated.
NEUT15|I just don't think that.
BULL16|And I do believe the president be able to do some zoom and will be surprised at how well the zoom does.
NEUT17|Jim, you know we're looking at a number of the travel stocks.
BEAR18|Get hit particularly hard I think on the assumption that there's a view that this is going to make this real for certain Americans, and maybe would reduce their willingness to travel, reduce their willingness to spend money.
NEUT19|Do you buy that argument and not one bit?
BEAR20|I think that only 19 people, since the period that Covid is started according to medical sources and Boeing have contracted covid from flying in planes, and that's because people wear masks.
NEUT21|The president has been quite, I say, cynical, about mask wearing.
BEAR22|I think that this is going to increase mask wearing, which will therefore further the tamping of the virus.
NEUT23|Not unlike Southeast Asia.
NEUT24|So I don't want to say that this is this sad event is good news for America, but you know, if you wear masks as people do on their own planes, it works.
NEUT25|19 people have covid after millions of people have flown at, documented by medical sources, why they wear?
NEUT26|Mass on plates.
NEUT27|And if you wear a mask, you're stupid.
NEUT28|Jim, Jim, it's an important point.
NEUT29|We raised it earlier that that in a very it may be unconventional thought, but if there is a positive from this from this situation, perhaps more Americans will wear masks, and we appreciate this and your primary person who has stood in the way of this being tamped.
NEUT30|Is the press the United States 'cause he doesn't wear mask and he makes fun of the vice president?
NEUT31|For wearing a mask, a big mess.
NEUT32|Well, maybe we have to rethink that.
NEUT33|Maybe the Tennessee Titans have to rethink that.
NEUT34|Maybe the country has to rethink that.
NEUT35|So yes, maybe something good could come of it, which is that the every scientist, every epidemiologist, every person who understands arsole all agree that mastered.
NEUT36|The only hope, really, haptically indoors.
NEUT37|So maybe that changes it.
NEUT38|Maybe the notion that you're somehow not tough enough.
NEUT39|To wear mask goes away.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
