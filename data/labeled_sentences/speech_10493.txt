NEUT0|"""Alright, let's get to a mad dash."
BULL1|I think over heard Pinterest Yes, and also snap.
NEUT2|I should throw that in.
NEUT3|This is a Bank of America peacetime referencing David for those who are caught up in the notion that how interest rates affect stocks, they should read this piece 'cause it really is about how when rates go higher, what is with these stocks that go up 500% last year?
NEUT4|Saying that this is it's time to rethink and they want to downgrade because that these stocks are going to have multiple compression.
NEUT5|Based on the yield and that they're far too linked with the stay at Home movement, when people are going to start going out and so they like booking booking.com and what you know what David?
NEUT6|I'm in agreement with this I I happen to love Pinterest, but you see what this to that one good quarter right?
NEUT7|And and I like Pinterest, 'cause it's hobbyists and stuff.
NEUT8|But David, this is the residue of that era where if you lived inside and didn't think that the vaccines were going, roll out this fast.
NEUT9|You felt like you had another couple of quarters, right?
NEUT10|I don't feel people feel like that.
BEAR11|I think everyone is broken AstraZeneca.
NEUT12|We haven't talked about it but and I don't know whether people want to go for it.
NEUT13|But there the vaccine is starting to be available for people who are not.
NEUT14|My age yes and and that means they're going to go out and they're going to travel again.
NEUT15|And so therefore maybe they don't stay home and look and look.
NEUT16|I think people still cook, right?
NEUT17|I really do.
NEUT18|But if you think that they aren't, if you think you're going to look at the pictures part to travel and they have big European component and that Europe is still shut down.
NEUT19|But I do point out that when you look at SNAP which is had can we show snap chart snap is unbelievable.
NEUT20|Yeah there is this multiple correct you.
NEUT21|If you get rates look at this one David if you get.
NEUT22|Rates going up more I just I know, you know, our people need to understand that it is not.
NEUT23|Now remember the comparisons.
NEUT24|Right now we're right at the almost at the bottom I know, but people need to under remember that.
BULL25|A 470% rise in the stock price in 12.
NEUT26|That's why this isn't very common sense piece.
NEUT27|These you know the bear case, more multiple compression.
NEUT28|I mentioned it 'cause a lot of the younger investors David the Simis.
NEUT29|Yeah, they don't know multiple compression but they gotta learn it because they might be surprised about why Pinterest is going down.
NEUT30|Even though Pinterest isn't saying anything right?
NEUT31|And it has to do with the fact that people traditional money matters not that Patricia money managers look at this at the tenure and make a decision about whether this is up too much.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
