NEUT0|"""Smsststockmarketplunging.com, what we're going to show you an after hours here is that the earnings on Disney and you can see that the quarter at $0.67 per share."
BULL1|It's 9 pennies better.
BULL2|Than estimated and revenues rose 16.4% year to year 10 billion versus 9.38 billion consensus.
BULL3|Now that's a very nice increase.
BULL4|The Q2 Revs from Parks and Resorts increased 3%, which is nice to 2.8 billion and segment.
NEUT5|Well, let's talk about one other thing that's most important.
NEUT6|This one right here.
BEAR7|Let's just use this work income decreased 8% to 477 million.
NEUT8|That's an important number, and it's a number that you would want to watch going forward.
BULL9|The other thing that we like is that the Disney Cruise Line, partially offset by improved results at international operations.
NEUT10|So basically what that tells me here is people have been out and from around the world or whatever and and been going around.
BULL11|And engaging with their cruise line so they picked up some revenue there.
BEAR12|The report is not bad on the revenue side.
NEUT13|There's nothing wrong with it.
NEUT14|The headline numbers wonderful to the next thing though is the actual stock has closed at 3529 and you can see that the bids in the ask it's you know it's up a little bit $0.50.
NEUT15|That's the Disney earnings reports.
NEUT16|They'll have a conference call and I'll talk about what forward looking like.
NEUT17|Events maybe and so.
BULL18|"Executed well."""
