NEUT0|"""What do you make of the numbers?"
NEUT1|Yeah, I mean the glaring omission is there's no stated 2021 forecasts for deliveries right?
NEUT2|And you know, I've written a lot in the build up to these earnings.
NEUT3|That consensus was around 800,000.
NEUT4|Some murmurs that it could be a million.
NEUT5|What Tesla is saying in the releases that they expect to grow deliveries 50% sequentially every year.
NEUT6|From this point onwards.
BULL7|What's very important to note in the release is that the installed capacity, particularly in Shanghai, has grown since the prior quarter.
NEUT8|So they installed capacity.
NEUT9|The number of cars that they can physically get through the production lines in a calendar year.
NEUT10|Is closer to a million than it is to that.
NEUT11|800,000 consensus, though is talking about otherwise it's a mixed bag, right?
NEUT12|Guys, look at the financials a beat on revenue and miss on earnings per share.
BULL13|Free cash flow, much better than they expected.
NEUT14|All the things we used to ping Tesla on every single quarter.
BEAR15|So it is a mixed bag.
BEAR16|But the disappointment is clearly there in the after hours reaction.
NEUT17|And the glaring omission is that there is no clear stated goal for what will be delivered this year.
NEUT18|But what's the general sense here that investors are looking for?
NEUT19|Is it just that growth and deliveries because?
NEUT20|All through 2020, especially when we saw that run up towards the end of the year, there was all this talk about Tesla was more than a car company.
NEUT21|It was more about their deliveries that this was a tech company.
NEUT22|This was a battery company.
NEUT23|This was, you know, so many other things and that is what justified the valuation.
NEUT24|What about those other things?
NEUT25|Is that in this news release?
NEUT26|No, I I go back to the recent raises on price target and Anne knew ratings on the stock from Wall Street every time a price targets been raised and even when the Bears have conceded that they were wrong.
NEUT27|If you read the note that they put out on that morning, it says that a lot of the valuation is assigned on future revenues.
NEUT28|High margin software revenues, the idea of autonomy and Robo taxis.
NEUT29|The idea of energy storage, which we don't talk about a lot.
NEUT30|Guys right?
NEUT31|Tesla has this whole other business about commercial residential energy storage, solar and a lot of what's baked into the share price.
NEUT32|Is reflective of that.
NEUT33|Elon Musk is very good at keeping investors looking to the horizon every time there's an earnings call.
NEUT34|There's a little carrot about what's 235 years down the line talking about 20-30.
BULL35|Delivery targets expanding manufacturing over the course of five years.
NEUT36|The issue is, is that Tesla may be the incumbent in this market, but it's delivering very few vehicles relative to its combustion engine peers.
NEUT37|VW Toyota deliver 10 million vehicles each apiece.
NEUT38|Yes, they're not battery electric, but that's the reality check that we're getting here that it has a lot more work.
BULL39|Cap ex time that it needs to expand its global manufacturing footprint to get their cars up to speed.
BEAR40|And it's still a little way off on those value ads that are reflective of the share price right now.
NEUT41|And talk to me about that.
NEUT42|I'm on page.
NEUT43|I think 9 or 10 on the press release.
BULL44|We know Shanghai was a success.
NEUT45|They talk about Berlin.
NEUT46|They talked about their next Gigafactory here in Texas for the Model Y capacity.
NEUT47|Where do you see that next leg of growth when it comes from the product?
NEUT48|Yeah, I mean credit where credit is due, right?
NEUT49|Tesla says in the earnings release that Austin and Berlin will come online this year, they've already started moving machinery into the factory in Berlin.
NEUT50|In terms of like the context here that they've built those factories incredibly quickly, you know we assign a lot of kudos to Tesla for being the incumbent.
NEUT51|They have great technology, but you forget at the end of the day, they're in the business of building 'cause it's capital intensive.
NEUT52|It's very difficult to look at the struggles that GM and Ford are having an electrifying their fleets, but they're on targets.
NEUT53|Bring 2 new factories online in 2021.
BULL54|They also confirmed that the Tesla Semi truck, a new product range, a heavy truck battery electric will also come to market this year, so they're making progress.
NEUT55|It's just it's not happening.
NEUT56|"This week, January 2021 is something that will happen by year, end and beyond that, and we're all very impatient."""
