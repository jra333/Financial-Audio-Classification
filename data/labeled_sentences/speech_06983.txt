NEUT0|"""What are the companies that you've been looking at investing in and what are the areas that you think are most productive for you guys to venture into?"
NEUT1|Well, we're in a number of sectors were in insurance with akasher.
NEUT2|They're one of the largest brokers in the world, and the idea was to use our artificial intelligence algorithms that we've developed over the past couple of years.
NEUT3|And to apply that to their entire platform.
BULL4|So we're very excited about that.
BULL5|It's obviously a large sector, and something that we think has some room to grow.
NEUT6|And in terms of the way we look at it and when.
NEUT7|What the broker of the future is going to.
NEUT8|Is going to look like.
NEUT9|We we are in a company called Figs which is a healthcare workwear company run by two brilliant women who've done an amazing job of growing that company and obviously over this past year I think all of us have taken a moment to think about how incredibly important the healthcare sector is in the workers are on the front line each and every day, so that's a company where we proud of where an investor or company called Roadrunner.
NEUT10|Which is in the waste management business and recycling that uses a very interesting business model.
NEUT11|We're in the security business with Edgeworth who uses artificial intelligence to do anomaly detection through camera systems.
NEUT12|And a few others, but so it's diverse.
NEUT13|But you know, is work well for us.
NEUT14|He is it kind of like Berkshire Hathaway or Oh my goodness, well you just named.
NEUT15|I mean in structure and Marty Willhite, who's the Vice Chairman was formerly at Munger Tolles and worked with that group.
NEUT16|Certainly I would never put anything in the same paragraph with Mr. Munger and Mr. Buffett, but just to me what I like about it is it's not a fund, it's permanent capital.
NEUT17|It allows us maximum flexibility on what to do with the companies.
BULL18|Make sure they have the capital that they need, certainly providing hopefully some business acumen and then the tech side.
BULL19|But it just allows us a lot of flexibility.
NEUT20|We don't have pressures on.
NEUT21|Vintage your funds or anything like that and let them grow at the pace they need to grow at.
NEUT22|Yeah, right, so I can see that it's not private equity per say or venture anything like that in permanent capital.
NEUT23|I get it.
NEUT24|Have you talked to Warren or Charlie about business at all ever?
BULL25|Thomas yeah, I had the privilege of sitting with with Warren.
NEUT26|For almost 2 hours in his office in Omaha, which was beyond privilege, is something I will treasure for the rest of my life.
NEUT27|And there was a moment I don't think he mind me sharing this where I was describing and talking through the business model and how I thought about something and I said we're trying to do is to be smart about it.
NEUT28|He stopped meaning us.
NEUT29|I gotta be honest for years, Charlie and I have always asked what's the dumb thing we could do here and I kind of laughed and he said, no, I'm dead serious.
NEUT30|We always ask.
NEUT31|We don't want to be in the clever pile once.
NEUT32|What could we do here?
NEUT33|That would be the dumb thing.
NEUT34|And how do we avoid it?
NEUT35|Honestly, it actually is how to.
NEUT36|Fair amount of impact on the way that I assess and think about situations.
NEUT37|"And you know, it's he's incredibly sharp and it's something again that that I'll that time will treasure forever."""
