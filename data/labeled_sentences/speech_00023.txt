BULL2|NIO stock is better than Tesla, the Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, NEO, and its American rival, Tesla, have both been doing amazing this year, with Tesla rising over 750% in the last year and Nile rising over 1700% in the same.
NEUT3|Time span many analysts used to say that Tesla was the safer pick and that we would have more guaranteed gains.
NEUT4|But the times are changing and more analysts are choosing now than ever, especially with Tesla's insane recent bull Run today.
BEAR5|Analysts are saying that Tesla is overpriced and that it might not have as big of a future as the stock predicts.
BULL6|I disagree with that, but I do think that Neo will have better growth in the next five years.
