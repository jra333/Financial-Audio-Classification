NEUT1|The real Wolf of Wall Street, Jordan Belford is weighing in on the GameStop and AMC stock craze warning that those jumping on board the handful of stocks that are going through the roof due to Reddit users are playing with Fire Bell for two amassed a fortune in the 1990s as a stock broker in New York City.
NEUT2|With his own firm before spending 22 months in prison for fraud and corruption published his memoir, The Wolf of Wall Street in 2000.
NEUT3|Seven that of course, was adapted into a 2013 film of the same name, starring Leonardo DiCaprio.
NEUT4|My name is Jordan Belford.
BEAR5|The year I turned 26, I made $49 million, which really ****** me off because it was three shy of a million a week.
NEUT6|In an interview with CNN, business Belfort gave his take on the stocks that are skyrocketing via hype, mostly on Reddit.
NEUT7|If you could prove that they were actually colluding together, then it would be illegal.
NEUT8|The Wolf of Wall Street author and film subject went on to say this.
NEUT9|The problem is, is that you know it's sort of this sort of weird loose.
NEUT10|Collusion where you know one person is, let's stick together and stay strong.
NEUT11|Theoretically that's not legal, but I would doubt that the SEC we try to make a case out of something like that, Bellfort told CNN business that the average person could actually make a lot of money through the hot stocks, but they could lose it all too.
NEUT12|It's like a modified pumping dump 'cause at the end of the day it will most certainly go back down 'cause it's not trading based on any rational fundamental value.
NEUT13|Belford cautioned this, just remember.
NEUT14|Every time the market goes up like a GameStop goes up, it's gonna get harder and harder to make that next move up because the market caps eventually gets the point.

BEAR16|People are going to get hurt and it will likely be the average lower income individuals who attempt to catch the Golden goose too late.
BEAR17|There are going to be some massive victims in this whole thing.
NEUT18|They most certainly, and I think that frankly, is already starting.
NEUT19|I think some of the brokerage firms like Ameritrade and others have.
