NEUT0|"""Everybody, Jason Moser here with Brendan Matthews joining you for another edition of Ask a fool and today we're taking a question from Rosie and Rosie asks what is the future prospects and growth for Russian stocks?"
NEUT1|Are there any good stock picks out there and you know Brendan, this is, you know it is the world becomes more global as the markets become more global, certainly more opportunities out there.
NEUT2|But just because it's it's overseas or an international opportunity doesn't always make it a good one.
NEUT3|What's your take on Russian stocks?
BEAR4|So first of all, my general take on Russian stocks is is very negative.
NEUT5|The country doesn't necessarily have the rule of law or respect for shareholders and a lot of companies there are state owned enterprises which are explicitly owned by the state who may not have shareholder value creation in mind.
NEUT6|They may be pursuing other goals and then even companies are explicitly owned by this state.
NEUT7|I think there's a lot of implicit control by the government over stocks.
NEUT8|That said, there is one stock that it would actually consider in Russia, and that's.
NEUT9|Yandex Oh yeah.
NEUT10|So it's the number one Internet destination in Russia.
NEUT11|They have majority 60% of search share.
BULL12|They've grown their their adjusted net income at 40% annually over 40% annually since 2007 and it's raining.
BULL13|Pretty reasonable valuation 20 to 25 times earnings and that's obviously building in a discount because it's in Russia.
NEUT14|Yeah, I mean, I like.
NEUT15|I think that really whenever you're looking in international markets, particularly emerging markets and Russia, is one of those one of those markets.
NEUT16|Obviously very big, but I think you know still plenty.
BULL17|Plenty of plenty of room to go there.
NEUT18|You have to just be very discriminating and really find the market leaders.
NEUT19|The companies that are changing, changing the game there, and I think that for future generations that there will become more opportunities as the as these companies catch up a little bit more with modern times.
NEUT20|Another way I like to just get some exposure to countries like Russia or any of the other sort of emerging economies.
NEUT21|There is just through those big multinationals companies every day here.
NEUT22|In their base here, you know we know a lot about Coca Cola or Apple or McDonald's or Starbucks, but those are companies.
NEUT23|They make a lot of their money overseas and those are companies that are also making a lot of headway into international markets like Russia too.
NEUT24|So that's just another way to get some exposure to those emerging markets without without taking that big risk of a company that may not be able to get a whole lot of information all right, and so another thing I would just add to your sort of.
NEUT25|Your point about being discriminating.
NEUT26|It's one of the things I like about you.
NEUT27|Edx is it's heavily owned by insiders, so over 20% of the company is owned by insiders.
NEUT28|So I would I would consider it.
NEUT29|I would I would.
NEUT30|I would also size the position appropriately because it's in Russia because you're going to currency issues.
BEAR31|You're going to have geopolitical issues.
NEUT32|I would maybe take take a smaller bite at it, depending on your appetite for risk.
NEUT33|Diversity is the key.
BULL34|Well, thanks.
NEUT35|A lot Brendan.
NEUT36|Thanks for the question.
