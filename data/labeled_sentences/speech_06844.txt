BULL0|"""Hey Joel, ConocoPhillips is Freeport LNG facility was approved last week."
NEUT1|What exactly can investors do to approach the situation?
BULL2|Yeah, definitely.
NEUT3|This is the second facility that's approved you Sasha, near in 2001 gain approval.
NEUT4|So now we're looking at about 3.4 billion cubic feet a day of export capacity that could go online by in 2007.
NEUT5|And if you look at Goldman Sachs, is basically reaffirms their view.
NEUT6|They've been looking at about 6.8 billion cubic feet.
NEUT7|That's what they think long term will be exported from the United States and basically, they're saying that.
NEUT8|You need a price of around $5 to be competitive, so that's really the ceiling.
BEAR9|You shouldn't see it crying too much more, otherwise you'll have to start seeing curbed exportation.
NEUT10|So really, if you look at that $5 mark, you have to look over the next few years and then long term as an investor.
NEUT11|And really, what you're seeing right now is gas prices at about $4, and then you see the LNG exportation should be coming on in 2015.
BULL12|So you should see some pressure of natural gas prices domestically.
BEAR13|However, you're not going to see the price really decreased because.
NEUT14|A lot of the people moving to oil are drilling at higher margins, so they're not going to switch from oil back to natural gas until you get to that inflection point of about $5 or more.
NEUT15|So really, in the short term and long term, you should see the price of natural gas really beaten about the four mid forced to pushing that 5 low fives, and that's really the point that it will stay long term.
NEUT16|And based on that window where you companies do you think investors could really look at as possibly gaining from this this four and a half to $5 window?
NEUT17|Yeah, definitely think right now is a great time for long term investors.
NEUT18|And really, where I would look is low cost natural gas producers.
NEUT19|Really these are companies that can produce at $4 and make a nice profit.
NEUT20|And I like the low cost producers that have access to selling their natural gas at the Henry Hub space because a lot of the export facilities are going to be around that.
BULL21|Texas, Louisiana space, which means the Henry Hub is going to be a lot higher than a lot of the other regional price market.
NEUT22|So I really like that.
NEUT23|So when you look at that, there's a few companies I really like.
NEUT24|Southwestern Energy is 1, it's.
BULL25|Really, a well managed company.
NEUT26|They have their one of the very low cost producers and they have a lot of assets in The Marcels an the Fayetteville shell so they have a lot of access to that Henry Hub market.
NEUT27|Another one ultra petroleum.
NEUT28|I really like them.
NEUT29|If you look at their low cost producer as well.
BEAR30|There are 2012 total cost was $3 so even at that $4 mark and if it gets up at 4:50 to $5 they're making extreme profits.
NEUT31|They have great assets, are trading at a good value right now so investors could really jump in there and then if you wanted.
NEUT32|One of the other place.
NEUT33|Obviously there's always Chesapeake Energy who's not as low cost producer, but they have a lot of natural gas.
NEUT34|There will make profits at about four dollars $4.50, and they have a lot of liquid's coming on, so that's one of the outside plays as well.
BULL35|However, the two full time natural gas low cost producers I really think are great long term investments.
BULL36|And then you also hope to see their balance sheet strength as they did suffer some write downs in 2012.
BEAR37|So as natural gas plummeted.
BULL38|So not only will that income statement probably look better, but also the balance sheet, which means great things for the debt markets, so hopefully.
BULL39|We need to see these companies grow with the price of gas.
NEUT40|"Be sure to check more on this on full calm and keep pulling on."""
