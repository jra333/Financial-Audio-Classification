NEUT0|"""When it comes to investing their money, the wealthy have gone through a huge change really."
NEUT1|In the last five years before the recession, the wealthy were all about U.S. stocks and they were about illiquid investments like private equity and hedge funds.
BEAR2|After the recession, U.S. stocks didn't do that well.
BEAR3|Private equity and hedge funds not only did they fall in value.
NEUT4|But people couldn't get their money out when they really needed cash in 2009, 2010.
NEUT5|So what's happened?
NEUT6|Is this total rotation for the wealthy away from these illiquid alternative investments, Tord, some very basic things that they can understand, and that are liquid.
NEUT7|Huge piles of cash.
NEUT8|I mean, the wealthy have record amounts of cash.
BEAR9|And all that cash, by the way, is not helping our recovery because it's just sitting in a bank account somewhere.
NEUT10|They also like gold right now.
BEAR11|Millionaires and billionaires in America are still very pessimistic about our financial system and our currency.
NEUT12|So what is a long-term store of value that 10 years from now if everything falls apart, will still be valuable so they like cash and they like goldran.
NEUT13|When I say gold, they're actually buying physical bars of gold, putting it in a safe and bearing it in their basements.
NEUT14|Large, large quantities of gold.
NEUT15|The other things that the wealthy are investing in our overseas stocks.
NEUT16|The wealthy are the most global segment of our population.
NEUT17|They see the great opportunities in India, China, Russia, Brazil.
NEUT18|All these fast growing emerging markets and they're putting a lot of their money in these markets primarily in stocks, but also in direct investments like they might buy an office tower in Mumbai or a chain of restaurants in Beijing.
NEUT19|Unite can't do that, but I think we can follow them in the sense that there are buying things in these emerging markets.
BULL20|"There's going to be more rapid economic growth in the future."""
