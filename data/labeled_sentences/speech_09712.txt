NEUT0|"""The Congressional Budget Office is now releasing some new data out with its latest forecast, and it sees the federal budget deficit hitting $1 trillion this year."
BEAR1|The deficit is at its highest level in eight years.
BULL2|The CBO also sees GDP expanding at 2.2% in 2020, but later in the decade as the US population ages and the labor force grows more slowly, say that growth will moderate to 1.7%.
BULL3|It's also expected that exports will rebound this year, driven by an increase in aircraft exports.
NEUT4|As Boeing resumes deliveries of its 737 Max, but Tyler, that is of course a big if I'm going to turn to Marcus Lemonis and get your reaction to that growth of two point 2%.
NEUT5|You run a lot of businesses, including a very large one, Camping World growth of two point 2% Anna deficit of over a trillion dollars.
NEUT6|Is that good enough for you as a business owner and manager?
BEAR7|Well, the deficit isn't good enough for anybody.
BULL8|It shouldn't be, but the growth I think is good enough if we keep our SG and a under control and we understand where that growth is going to come from.
BEAR9|Have to imagine that 2.2 is a result of certain things being down significantly and other things being up.
BEAR10|I know that sounds odd for me.
NEUT11|I want to understand where is the consumer today and what are they going to spend money on and the way their shopping is very different.
NEUT12|Does a little bit of inflation help you because it gives you cover to raise prices?
NEUT13|No, I don't think so.
NEUT14|I think this this notion that you can just raise prices and pass it on to the consumer as a bit of a misnomer and we continue to do that.
BEAR15|We're going to lose consumers.
NEUT16|"They're going to keep their money until prices come down and Mark is going to be."""
