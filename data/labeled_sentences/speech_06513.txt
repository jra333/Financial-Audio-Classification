NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Monday, November 6, 2017."
NEUT1|I'm a footballer John currency analyst at exam.com and today we're going to be looking at the New Zealand dollar versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|Kiwi dollar hit a five month low of Zero Point 6817 at the end of October.
BULL3|It has somewhat rebounded from those loads, although it has now met resistance at the 161.8%.
BEAR4|Fever Nachi level of the retracement from Zero Point 755 to Zero Point 7206 near term momentum is to the downside.
NEUT5|We can see RSI is below 50, although it is somewhat flat so the risk at the moment is neutral.
BULL6|If we look at the medium term picture we can see the Mac D although it has somewhat moved off those lows at the end of October.
BULL7|And has risen above its red signal line.
NEUT8|It is still.
NEUT9|Deeply below 0 also we can see the lower highs and the lows.
BULL10|Lower lows here in the daily chart we can see that there's a clear downtrend there if we see if prices managed to break above that resistance around zero point 69660, we could see the next resistance coming at around zero Point 7055 followed by around Zero point 7130 and that could potentially prove an interesting.
NEUT11|Resistance area, given that that's currently where the 250 day moving averages are converging.
BEAR12|We can see also that bearish cross there off the 50 day line moving below the 200 day one break above 0.72 would clearly shift the medium term outlook back to a bullish one.
NEUT13|But if we see a continuation of.
NEUT14|Downtrend near term support should come at five months loaves, Zero Point 6817 and below that we have the 424% baci with treatment at around zero point 6567 as the next key major support level.
NEUT15|That's it for me.
BULL16|"Thank you so much for watching and have a great day."""
