NEUT0|"""We're going to go to the big news today."
NEUT1|We got the jobs numbers.
BEAR2|It's not good news.
BULL3|the US economy gained a net.
BEAR4|80,000 new jobs with unemployment still stuck above 8%.
NEUT5|Here to explain why we're limping along like this is James Sherk, a senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC.
NEUT6|James joins us by telephone.
BULL7|James, welcome thank you.
NEUT8|So James.
BEAR9|80,000 net new jobs.
NEUT10|This is 42 months.
BEAR11|Of over 8% unemployment.
NEUT12|Is this the new normal?
BULL13|Hopefully not, but what this report showed was an economy treading water.
NEUT14|The employment growth, 80,000 jobs that was basically about what you need to to keep up with population growth, but not anymore.
NEUT15|And so that's what we saw.
BEAR16|Labor force participation was flat, the employment population was ratio was flat, and so was the unemployment rate 8.2%.
NEUT17|I mean, if you take a look at Europe for the past generation, they've been applying a lot of these policies of high taxes, excessive regulation.
BEAR18|And they've been stuck with these levels of unemployment and a French voters who simply come to accept 8 to 10% unemployment is the new normal.
NEUT19|I hope that doesn't happen here in James, you know, we look at these headline numbers 8.2%, but what does that mean for young workers for minorities?
NEUT20|For male workers, can you break down the numbers a little bit for us?
BEAR21|Exactly what's been going on in this economy is that you layoffs went up a lot in.
BEAR22|2008, 2009 during the crisis, but they've since come back completely down.
BULL23|So if you have a job today, you're actually doing alright.
BEAR24|You're no more likely to get fired than you were before the recession started, but if you don't have a job, well, there just aren't as many new job openings being created.
BEAR25|There are just many new businesses starting up the existing businesses are not expanding at the same rate, so for those workers who don't already have a job right now, it's very, very tough to get that first foothold in the job market.
BEAR26|And so for younger workers, then employment rate is much higher for a teenager.
NEUT27|It's about 25% off for those who are 20 to 24 years old.
BEAR28|So basically those who are just leaving community colleges or or I a full four year program through unemployment rate is around 17%.
BEAR29|It's a very, very difficult job switch situation right now for those who don't already have jobs, we're talking to James Sherk, senior policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation in Washington DC.
NEUT30|James let's turn now to the politics of this number.
NEUT31|The White House came out today and tried to really defend this.
NEUT32|The president says that the problem is Congress.
NEUT33|How do you respond to that?
BEAR34|Well, the administration predicted when they took office that if we pass another stimulus package unemployment right now would be 5 1/2%.
NEUT35|It's actually obviously 8.2% the attempts they tried.
BEAR36|The stimulus package simply didn't work, which shouldn't have been too much of a surprise that Japan has tried dozens of stimulus packages over the past two decades, and none of them have succeeded in stimulating the economy.
NEUT37|The president's medicine simply doesn't work at Snake Oil.
NEUT38|James, is there anything that can be done between now and November to change this trajectory?
NEUT39|Or do you think that this is what we're going to see in the ramp to the election?
NEUT40|We've got about a minute left.
BULL41|I don't think there's anything much that Congress can do that would cause the economy to appreciably speed up in the next few months.
NEUT42|There's things they can do to help the economy.
NEUT43|You're talking about hundreds of millions of individuals, workers, investors, business owners, and you can't change in economy like that on a dime.
NEUT44|OK, James, one very.
NEUT45|Last quick question, Romney campaign.
NEUT46|Did they come out?
NEUT47|Repeat the same messages today or is there anything new that we should note?
BEAR48|"Well, I think the point is that what we're trying right now hasn't been working and obviously they hope to benefit from a change in November, but they're exactly right that the current administration's record is indefensible."""
