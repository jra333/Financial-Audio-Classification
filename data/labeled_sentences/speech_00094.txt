BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to talk about Nokia stock ticker symbol and OK and my thoughts on the stock and if I think the stock could still be a buy so stick around.
NEUT2|So before I get into the video, make sure hit the subscribe button to keep up with our daily videos and also check out the links in the description to join the Discord the Patrion.
NEUT3|So I just want to get this disclaimer out of the way that I'm not a financial advisor, so this video is just for entertainment purposes only, so this is just my opinion.
BEAR4|So if we look at the stock as a light, we've been trading pretty flat around $4 except for this range we hit in the last couple of days where he bounced up to about $7.00.
NEUT5|Before returning to close today at $4.62, so Nokia is also currently one of the stocks that Robin Hood is limiting.
NEUT6|How many you can buy, and I think the limit right now is 5 shares.
NEUT7|Alright, so here's where I'm looking at is apply for this stock, although a lot can change over the weekend before market open on Monday, so I think it's really going to depend what your plan is.
NEUT8|If you were to buy into the stock.
NEUT9|If you're looking for long term offer just looking to ride some momentum.
NEUT10|If we get it and then sell.
NEUT11|So if you're looking for short term looking for a swing trade or something next week to quickly trade it.
BULL12|If we get some momentum and volume back, I think there's got a lot more potential and downside to this just because.
NEUT13|We were trading at 4 for such a long time.
BEAR14|That's kind of a bottom an this could easily go to $20.00 if we can get some momentum and volume back.
NEUT15|So if you're looking at this as more of a long term investment, I think buying around $4 would be pretty good.
NEUT16|Just because I think this company does have a lot of potential, like it's not just a meme stock, it does have a lot of potential.
NEUT17|So it is good for long term if you can get a good price around $4 'cause that's where the base kind of was trading before we had that big spike.
NEUT18|So one thing I'm really hoping happens is Robin Hood lifts up the restrictions on this stock 'cause buying five with the stock is almost not even worth it if we can get those restrictions off is going to have a lot more of an opportunity to have the momentum and the volume come back.
BULL19|That could propel us to 5/6/10 dollars.
NEUT20|$20 stuff like that, but I'm interested to hear what you guys think about this whole situation, so let me know what your price predictions are down below.
NEUT21|So pretty much just to summarize everything real quick again, if you're looking for a quick trade, if we can get that volume back next week.
NEUT22|And maybe get these restrictions lifted.
NEUT23|I think it has a lot more potential than downside to it.
BULL24|And as far as we're looking for long term, I do think this company is going to be solid long term.
NEUT25|I would just look to see if it dips a little bit more before going for a long term position.
NEUT26|So this is just my opinion is definitely not financial advice, but I am curious to hear what everyone thinks about this.
NEUT27|"So start some discussions down in the comments."""
