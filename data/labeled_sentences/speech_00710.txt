BEAR0|"""Also certainly gaining in European trading today, but of course they've been left in the dust by what is happening over at Tesla."
NEUT1|We are continuing to obviously with wide eyed amazement watch what is happening with Tesla, but let's talk more about what is going on with the auto sector.
NEUT2|Let's go to Scott food.
BULL3|Thanks guy.
NEUT4|Yeah, left in the dust is a generous way of putting it because auto sector, whether you're looking at what's happening in Europe in the US or Asia, is in the red struggling of course.
NEUT5|As these companies had to shut down their operations completely when COVID-19 first struck, now in Europe, we know that the auto sector was in particular already trying to revamp their operations before COVID-19 their specific challenge, of course, includes electrification.
BEAR6|You talked about Tesla, they're behind, they fallen behind the market leader, and now that they need to conserve cash, that tech Advantage threatens to gap open even more, and that they can't spend the money that they need to to catch up.
NEUT7|The headline today.
NEUT8|Just think about what I read, Jaguar is delaying its latest electric car model until next October, so that just gives you a sense the auto sector as a whole is much more important for Europe than it is in the United States.
NEUT9|In Europe it makes up 7% of GDP, 14 million jobs.
BEAR10|the US auto sector, by contrast, is less consequential on every count, especially total market share, although it does get a little bit closer there because for now it doesn't include Tesla well.
NEUT11|Speaking of, is there talk of the stock of the hour?
NEUT12|Is Tesla literally guy in every commercial break has been like?
NEUT13|Oh my God is at this price.
NEUT14|Is that maybe 2% in two days?
NEUT15|So scar, that's a League of its own at this point League of its own.
NEUT16|Absolutely, it's going to hold a battery day event in late September and I bring this up because that's the catalyst for today's advance.
NEUT17|Dan Ives over at Wedbush says that Tesla could announce game changing developments at that event, but it's not until late September.
BULL18|In the meantime, Tesla could really be stock of the month in stock of the year because it's up more than 60% in July.
BEAR19|It's only fallen once, and since its March low, it's gone from $361.00 to almost 1800.
BULL20|That big, like higher at the end there was this month when Tesla reported better than expected second quarter delivery numbers.
BULL21|And that's raised expectations.
BEAR22|It could post a gap profit for the second quarter, which would mark the fourth straight profit quarter of profit.
NEUT23|And that is the last hurdle the company needs for inclusion in the S&P 500, which of course would confer prestige and also give passive index funds a big reason to buy up all those Tesla shares so that they could then better track the index.
NEUT24|Just as market cap is now over $325 billion.
NEUT25|So if you look at the S&P 500, which again is not a member of.
BULL26|That would make it the 10th biggest company, bigger than PNG, bigger than JPMorgan, bigger than United Health or Exxon Mobil.
NEUT27|And the biggest automaker in the world as well, Pete, do a terrorist.
BULL28|My producer came up with this fantastic chart.
NEUT29|A great way to compare and contrast Tesla with the rest of the automakers, its market cap per vehicle sold is $870,000.
NEUT30|Look at that 13 times Porsches market cap per vehicle sold and 290 times what Fiat rates had.
NEUT31|I mean it?
NEUT32|"It's like you're not even comparing companies in the same sector."""
