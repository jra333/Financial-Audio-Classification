NEUT0|"""Alright, let's answer your questions now."
NEUT1|First up, Brenda, I'm coming to you from Stuart in Chicago.
NEUT2|Mondal aezs.
NEUT3|Is it a sell or a buy sell hold?
BEAR4|Yeah, so this is a name where 70% of revenue comes from outside of the US and the company, even though they did quite well last year with organic growth, there were some supply chain disruptions, so those should be on the mend as we look forward and it continues to be one of the growth.
NEUT5|Your names within the consumer Staples sector yet is not trading at a premium multiple, so we still really like this name alright.
NEUT6|Joe Di turn to you.
NEUT7|It's from John.
NEUT8|He's one of our regular viewers sends in a question about Adobe.
NEUT9|Is it a great buying opportunity?
BEAR10|On the dip after its amazing earnings report, CEO was on the network within the last hour the Joe T ETF owns it.
NEUT11|What do you think?
BULL12|I do think it's a tremendous opportunity.
BEAR13|Unfortunately, right now, low quality, weaker balance sheets.
NEUT14|That's what's favored in the market.
BULL15|But Scott, this is a company once again that beat on revenue growth 26% higher year on year versus consensus, which was 20% gross margin expansion.
NEUT16|Gross margins at 45%.
NEUT17|Let's not forget, this is just not a work from anywhere beneficiary from 2020.
BULL18|This is a second half of 2021 when we see the economy recovering further in consumer employment.
BULL19|Continues to grow.
BULL20|This is a company that's going to benefit from it.
BULL21|It's got the Creative Cloud platform that's going to be the critical driver and absolutely I think this is a stock that is going to see numbers back above $500 once again.
BULL22|Alright, so you're just telling me be a little patient and it's going to start performing again once we get to the level you suggest that we need to be in terms of the economy.
BULL23|"You could endure some further downside, but I still think looking back that will be a tremendous buy."""
