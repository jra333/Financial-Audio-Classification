NEUT0|"""Hey guys, let's take a look at Amazon."
NEUT1|The stock is trading up today, but what can we expect for tomorrow?
BULL2|He goes the stocks up nearly 3% today.
NEUT3|Let's take a look at the technical analysis to predict what we can expect for the coming days and even tomorrow.
NEUT4|So.
NEUT5|Let's start off with the putting the lines of resistance and support.
NEUT6|So up here, obviously we can put this all by itself.
NEUT7|It's all time high.
NEUT8|You have another support or resistance here.
BEAR9|At 3250 we have another resistance here.
NEUT10|At 3180 uhm.
NEUT11|I think that's.
NEUT12|Pretty much it, I mean that.
NEUT13|Is kind of at the level where it's at right now, so let's let's look at supports.
NEUT14|So we have this here.
NEUT15|About 3100 Mark that is Green as a support.
NEUT16|In this.
BULL17|This levels up a pretty good support here also, so they hit it a couple times.
NEUT18|Not quite at that point, but it's it's pretty close to 3150.
NEUT19|Put it here.
BULL20|OK, so stocks up big today.
BULL21|It made it a pretty good move pre market that people wise up huge today.
NEUT22|So let's probably led by the tech the last couple of days for the tech.
BEAR23|It's kind of been drifting down whole sectors.
BEAR24|Been pretty much down however.
BULL25|Today we're up big so.
NEUT26|Is it going to potentially?
NEUT27|Keep climbing.
NEUT28|Nothing's kind of stopping it with the coronavirus, so I can expect.
NEUT29|That it's probably some some like sector rotation, so some people took their money out and we could potentially have, you know.
NEUT30|People there, along putting more money in so one key point is this.
NEUT31|The support here at 3140 so we should watch out for that potentially.
NEUT32|We can bounce off of that and go up, or if we had to look at this 3180 and see if it actually gets rejected off of that, because potentially then it would.
BEAR33|It would continue downwards so.
NEUT34|That's I think what we can expect for the coming days.
NEUT35|Let me know what you think.
NEUT36|Into luck.
