BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking about Mara and why I think tomorrow is going to be huge in the coming months.
NEUT2|So stick around.
BEAR3|Omar's been kind of upsetting looking the stock price over the last week or so, especially when you look at other companies, do the similar things 'cause they have all had major run UPS.
NEUT4|But I think this is just temporary.
BULL5|I think in a couple of months Mar is going to be by far the best stock out of all of these.
NEUT6|So why is the Morris stock price not really moved over the past week?
NEUT7|This was because Mario is in the process of a share offering which ended up making him $200 million, which they then used in order to pay for the new miners that they bought, which costed $175 million.
BULL8|But once we found out last night that the share offering was complete, we saw a pretty good run up today, up above almost 25% for the day.
NEUT9|So these miners are the company bought.
NEUT10|They're going to start setting up in the coming months and they should be all completely set up by April.
BULL11|I think this is going to be huge because at that point Mar is going to have the best minors available.
BEAR12|So even though right now it looks like some of these other mining companies are doing very well and Morrow looks to be a little bit struggling, I think it was just because of this share offering in long term.
NEUT13|The next couple of months over this course of this year.
BULL14|As long as Bitcoin keeps rising like we're expecting it to, I think more is going to be by far the best mining company.
NEUT15|So what is my price prediction for the end of the year?
BULL16|I personally think Mario will be at least $50 by the end of the year, as long as you know Bitcoin continues to move up, and I think this these miners that they bought are going to be huge.
BULL17|I'm very excited about that.
NEUT18|I think this price target I put on at $50 is kind of conservative 'cause I also think it could go a lot higher than that.
NEUT19|So what do you guys think?
NEUT20|What's your guys's price target from are for the end of the year?
NEUT21|Let me know down below and remember, this isn't financial advice.
