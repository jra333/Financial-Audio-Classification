NEUT0|"""What's up everybody."
NEUT1|Welcome back to another video because you're all having a fantastic day and before we get started with this one quickly mention once again they have the link to my discord in description where I have over 925 members.
NEUT2|We have a great community and there so feel free to join and check that out.
NEUT3|If you haven't already, but other than that let's get right into this video.
NEUT4|So in today's video we're going over company known as Applied DNA Sciences.
BULL5|Their ticker symbol is APD and as you guys can see, this penny stock has doubled on a date today through 100.88% or $5.62 up to a total of $11.00.
NEUT6|And $0.30 you can see prior to today's surge they were trading between the $5.60 to $5.80 range.
BULL7|Then they had this massive spike that brought them all way up to $11.15 before cooling off down to about $8.85 and then re climbing and pushing highs of the days over here.
BEAR8|At the moment of $11.48 for take a quick look at the weekly chart you can see in just the past week, primarily due to Tate today's movement, they are 123.27% on the month up 73.72%.
BULL9|The three month, about 52%, and then on a year now up 167.81%.
BEAR10|They did have all time highs back on May 14th of 2020 where they hit $15.21 and ever since then they have been kind of downtrending.
NEUT11|As you can see on this right hand on the graph, if you take a look at the reason behind today's movement you can see they had some pretty big news come out today regarding their COVID-19 test.
BULL12|The FDA came out and granted them emergency use authorization for their COVID-19 tests that does detect the new mutation of COVID-19 that was originally found in the UK.
BEAR13|It is spreading to other parts of the world, including the United States.
NEUT14|So obviously this is some pretty big news.
NEUT15|This is only one of two tests that has been approved by the FDA so far, so I do think that this reaction is justifiable.
NEUT16|I mean, up to 100% is pretty crazy, but this is like I said guys, some pretty big news, particularly here on thinkorswim.
NEUT17|You can see part of the news.
NEUT18|They really were just flat between this upper and lower VWAP.
NEUT19|You can see it's really hard to see these candles 'cause there's relatively no volume then indicate over here you can see the volume just pours and they spike from about $6.04.
BEAR20|All the way up to about $11.26 in the matter of about 5-10 minutes after that they cooled off.
NEUT21|They held the view up.
BULL22|The volume did remain pretty consistent.
BEAR23|You can see the Mac D cross down, which does indicate a downtrend.
BULL24|They pulled back a little bit, remained pretty strong right here at this view out there were some strong buys right around this area.
BULL25|Got pushed back up, held strong again.
NEUT26|They never touched it over here and if I zoom out a little bit more you can see at the moment they do look pretty strong.
BULL27|This is a pretty healthy move for a stock that's up 100%.
NEUT28|I would say this is a pretty healthy.
BEAR29|Move they are pulling back the balance.
BEAR30|They pull back.
NEUT31|That balance is not just a straight shot, even though that's what happened right here.
NEUT32|You can see at the moment they are creating new highs of the days.
BEAR33|They just hit $11.80.
BULL34|I do think that this one has the potential to be an after hours runner because like I said guys, this is pretty big news.
NEUT35|If you're going to trade on them guys.
NEUT36|As you can see over here, they don't have options, so the only thing you can really do is buy shares as you think that this could be along a good long term hold, but something that goes up 100% typically on average guys does not hold.
NEUT37|I mean this is just crazy.
BULL38|You doubled your money today.
NEUT39|If you were in prior to this.
NEUT40|And congratulations if you did so, I really want to be chasing at these levels, but I do think it has a little bit more upside, but I really don't think the risk is worth the risk is worth the reward in this scenario guy.
NEUT41|So I would stay away.
NEUT42|But then that case that is about it for this video.
