NEUT0|"""Hey, I'm dan.fitzpatrick@stockmarketmentor.com and I want to go into Winnebago here."
NEUT1|I haven't looked at this stock in quite awhile an I'll tell you why.
BEAR2|It's there's really no magic to it because the stocks been moving down an when stocks are drifting lower like this.
NEUT3|I look, it's really simple.
NEUT4|I don't like to pick when they're going to move higher.
NEUT5|I don't like to pick when they're going to stop going down.
NEUT6|I just have it on a list and you know, every once in awhile I.
NEUT7|Look at it and move on, because nothing's exciting.
NEUT8|Well, I won't tell you that this is exciting, but it could be starting to get exciting because I want to.
NEUT9|I want to look at this in, you know, in a real kind of a microscopic view.
BEAR10|So you see this downtrend here.
NEUT11|If we just kind of connect for the most part, you know we connect this dot and this one and then kind of right around there and here, just kind of drag this line down so the.
NEUT12|You know the resistance lines right down there, so the stock finally broke through this in late November, and since that time it rallied up almost hit 60, pulled back.
BEAR13|Pretty big volume here, a little bit higher than average and then the following day, you know Wednesday a big high magnitude moved down but on lower volume Thursday, boring yawn not that much volume, but then on Friday today the stock gapped and ran, so it's right back up to where it was here.
NEUT14|Like this.
NEUT15|The top this the bottom of this box.
NEUT16|So the stocks just about ready to break out.
NEUT17|I would say if the stock runs up to say 59 I wouldn't even wait for six.
NEUT18|If the stock runs up to say 5910, I think you could take a shot and start a position, not a full position because 60 bucks is a logical place for supply to be hiding, but if you take a small position in the stock and then add to that position if Winnebago runs above 60 bucks, I think this could work.
NEUT19|I think it would work, could work really well, and then I would just put a stop like right underneath.
BEAR20|Thursdays intraday low of 5415.
NEUT21|I would put a stop at 5410.
NEUT22|That's your trade.
NEUT23|OK. One thing if you did not see my video my class that I taught last night on assessing tops an find just kind of figuring out when you need to sell a stock purchase versus hanging onto it.
NEUT24|I taught this class last night, it's free to members, not for you.
BULL25|If you're not a member, but it was free to members an we got a lot of real positive feedback on it.
NEUT26|Really, really helpful to people, and in this kind of market, that's a real key thing.
NEUT27|Frankly, it really is.
NEUT28|You gotta know when to look for to sell not just to buy.
NEUT29|Everybody talks about buying, nobody knows when the hell does sell.
NEUT30|How's that for a rhyme?
NEUT31|And so that's the thing that I went into an I want you to see that if you remember don't blow it off.
