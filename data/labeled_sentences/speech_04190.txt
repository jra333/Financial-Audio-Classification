NEUT1|When you're buying a stock, you're really investing in the future of that company.
NEUT2|It's all about potential.
NEUT3|It's all about forward expectation, so you've got to account for that when you're doing your investing research.
NEUT4|Essentially, you should think of a market opportunity for a company, just like a pharmaceutical.
NEUT5|Companies like Pfizer looks at the potential for new drug.
NEUT6|It's not going to go after development.
NEUT7|An expensive R&D for a small obscured disease when it really could be developing new drugs for the common cold.
BEAR8|Something some kind of ailment that afflicts all flicks, all people.
NEUT9|The same thing is true of investors.
NEUT10|You really want to go after companies that have all sorts of room to grow out into the future now to click examples of one company that is a great forward opportunity versus one that is not so great opportunity.
NEUT11|Or, Netflix and Shoemaker Crocs.
NEUT12|Netflix as you know.
NEUT13|Is that online movies subscription company.
NEUT14|It's growing very quickly and what you think about when you think about Netflix is a company that only has 15 million active subscribers compared to a population in this country.
NEUT15|300,000,000 and that is about 5% of the total population, and yet the entire country watches movies.
NEUT16|I mean, what percentage of people don't don't like to enjoy the?
NEUT17|You know the latest.
BULL18|The latest blockbuster hit.
BULL19|So this is a company that has incredible forward opportunity.
NEUT20|This is why investors are so excited about it.
NEUT21|On the other hand, you have a company like Crocs.
NEUT22|Now at one point, Crocs at all sorts of potential.
NEUT23|But the fact of the matter is there are silly little shoes and sneakers are so ubiquitous.
NEUT24|Now everyone knows what they look like.
NEUT25|Everyone is taking a look.
NEUT26|And they pretty much made the decision a either I want this or I don't want this.
NEUT27|Their market opportunity is relatively small and that's the dynamic you have to incorporate when you're making these crucial investing decisions.
NEUT28|Is the future big?
NEUT29|Is it massive?
BULL30|Do they have plenty of room to expand or have they reached a kind of saturation point in the market?
NEUT31|That's a crucial thing to understand.
NEUT32|Is an investor.
NEUT33|It's something you always want to keep in mind.
BULL34|Thanks very much.
NEUT35|"That's my piece for today, Foulon."""
