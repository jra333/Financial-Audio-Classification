NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol S HLL we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Do this analysis previously so that is where the annotations here are coming from and what I want to first do here is I just want to get rid of these lines both here and here.
NEUT4|Yes, both of them pertain to the chart, but I just want to like from presentation sample donors causing clutter confusion 'cause there's lines every look.
NEUT5|So let's try to keep this as clean as possible.
NEUT6|But before I even delete this other line just to set up some overall context here, very nice day or said another way, what's going on right now is that red line break out due this trendline?
NEUT7|Break it, like I said in a previous video, the prices broken above it came back down beautiful back test of it.
NEUT8|So that is the overall context right now, a trendline breakout.
NEUT9|So not just a question of seeing if that trend line breakout can build upon itself an you know, in order to kind of help gauge that a very helpful level is going to be that level right down there at $48.35 and 4835 is important.
BEAR10|I'm not saying this was going to occur, but if the price were to go down to that level and then breakdown blow, it does that destroy the entire chart.
NEUT11|I'm not saying that at all, but does it destroy that red line?
NEUT12|Break out?
NEUT13|That again is currently going on?
BEAR14|Yeah, that that would have destroyed that house so well.
NEUT15|I mean, that would quite literally putting the price.
NEUT16|Right back to where it was before it broke out of that red line and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT17|But price movements that go back to where they were after breaking out was the exact contradiction of a break out.
NEUT18|Again, not saying that's what's going to occur, but 4835 makes it a very cut and dry level to watch and gauge whether or not that trendline breakout truly does have genuine power behind it.
NEUT19|Or maybe it was just one of these faulty breakouts, but as of now, so far so good in terms of always of resistance, nothing fancy or complicated here.
BEAR20|That red line breakout finally ran out of steam, right up around 5175.
NEUT21|So that will be the main level to watch from the resistance side of things, but All in all, nice movement today.
BULL22|Very nice red line break.
BULL23|Not just a question of can the price continued to build upon the momentum next week.
NEUT24|Let's see what happens.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT27|But it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT35|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live.
NEUT37|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT38|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
