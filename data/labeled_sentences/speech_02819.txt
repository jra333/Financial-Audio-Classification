NEUT0|"""Skinny and weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is a 28 of December 2020, Monday, the first day of the week we're at #43 Ethereum Classic with the ticker.
BULL2|ET C So far, Theorem classic gains BDC.
BEAR3|Things aren't looking good.
NEUT4|Last week we say that again classic year his hit target we had a target from classic over here at around 288 somewhere around there.
BEAR5|Yeah, we've really hit target and we continue dropping lower and lower so you can see that a theorem classic is in a very very.
BEAR6|Very, very bad shape actually against BTC.
BEAR7|Things are not looking good for a theorem classic.
BULL8|However we already hitting the support line over here will support kick in and push theorems price higher.
NEUT9|Who knows I don't know.
NEUT10|I don't really see any clear bullish moves coming on for theorem yet.
NEUT11|There is a hammer over here so this could.
NEUT12|I don't know this could be the start of a new trend change maybe, but then again, just because you see him and doesn't mean things are going to reverse.
NEUT13|Yes there was a hammer over here, but that doesn't mean that things.
NEUT14|I mean, it doesn't mean that the trend is going to switch.
NEUT15|Foolish right?
NEUT16|All we know is that things are still very bearish, and so you're going to be very, very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT17|Alright, let's move on to a third party against USD.
NEUT18|But before that please give this video a like.
NEUT19|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about thermoplastic endowment speak low.
BEAR20|Foreign currency against USD.
BEAR21|We are still in a sideways move for thermoplastic.
NEUT22|Are we going to be?
NEUT23|Yeah, again it's just not tradeable.
NEUT24|Chop it in for a third classic.
NEUT25|The possibilities still remain for both directions.
BULL26|We could still go up yes, and we can still go down.
NEUT27|The chances are still pretty open at this point of time.
NEUT28|There are biclusters over here.
BEAR29|Cell clusters over here, so if the price gets pushed down I mean get pulled down then potentially we could drop back down towards the neckline.
NEUT30|If you start dropping back down towards the neckline then.
NEUT31|This could be a completion of a fourth, third or fourth Mountaineer third month.
NEUT32|I'm just going to consider this as a third month and this could be completion.
BEAR33|Offer tip mounted right and this could be a hit insurers kind of workshop it and in a thermoplastic could be dropping much, much much much, much, much lower.
NEUT34|We can say for sure, but the potential estate however at the same time we could also be on the rampage back towards the upside if that happens this could be a five with kind of a chop it and write.
NEUT35|This would be an ABCDE kind of a chat.
NEUT36|And yes maybe yeah so this will be a 12345.
NEUT37|Five wave impulsive move towards the upside.
NEUT38|So again like I was saying, is still very uncertain.
NEUT39|There is a lot of our red candle sticks over here.
NEUT40|A lot of selling and so in terms of our trade ability, I don't think a thermoplastic is worth the risk.
NEUT41|Though it looks like a very risky trade in my opinion.
NEUT42|Imagine if you went shot over here and then we start going wrong.
NEUT43|Or if you switch long right and suddenly we start dropping again.
NEUT44|It is very uncertain untradeable and so the best thing to do is to avoid it right in terms of risk ratio trader you want to have an edge over everyone else, and if you don't really see anything that conforms to your system or method, then you just move on, move on to the next coin.
NEUT45|You don't have to be stuck trading only one point, right?
NEUT46|Yeah, I guess it on my thermoplastic technical analysis.
BULL47|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL48|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT49|"I shall see you in the next video."""
