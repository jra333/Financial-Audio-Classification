NEUT0|"""Alright, well let's think about the Apple stock we can see here."
BULL1|Today I pulled her jump to 2.4% and nearly.
BULL2|Bounced back approach Tony this year may only thing we need to pay attention to that it has been back above the black line against.
BULL3|Positive sign and constructive side, but we need to pay to do that.
BEAR4|There still two year may lines hanging above.
BEAR5|That means as long as we keep below these two lines, there's still possibility for it to go lower.
NEUT6|So we need to pay attention to for the volume.
BULL7|Volume is not so strong, so I think we need a higher volume to support the price to go higher.
BULL8|"Thank you."""
