NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Richard Hunter, head of markets and welcome to our look ahead for the week commencing the 13th of July."
BEAR1|Markets have had some struggles this week in making any progress, mainly the 2nd wave of the coronavirus in the states, which is held back.
NEUT2|Thoughts of any immediate economic recovery.
BULL3|Obviously we've seen that in the UK to some extent with the Chancellor's UK mini budget looking to solve some of the problems in youth unemployment, and indeed the hospitality sector.
NEUT4|So as such we've seen the year to date figures.
NEUT5|Not move the dial too much this week.
BEAR6|The Dow Jones in the year to date is now down 10%.
BEAR7|The S&P 500 is down 2%.
NEUT8|The NASDAQ continues its for a head.
BEAR9|It's up 17 1/2 percent when we last spoke this time last week, it was up 14% and unfortunately the Footsie 100 continues to be the laggard, down 20% in the year to date.
NEUT10|Looking ahead to next week, it is a big week on a number of fronts, not least of which that the US second quarter first half year.
NEUT11|Reporting season gets underway proper as his traditionally the case it will be dominated by the banks, so look out in the US next week for updates from the likes of JP Morgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America.
BULL12|On top of that, we've said that the tech sector is flying.
NEUT13|We should get further confirmation of that.
NEUT14|There are updates also coming from Microsoft and Netflix in the UK.
NEUT15|Also on the retail front, three very interesting stocks to look out for.
NEUT16|The first one is.
NEUT17|AO World, obviously household appliances and electrical.
NEUT18|There had been some rumors that in the early days of lockdown, the sale of white goods was very much to be found, especially the likes of chest freezers for example, and just looking at the AO share price, there's obviously been some optimism built in there.
BULL19|The shares are actually up 70% in the year to date, and if you measure it from their March loads, they're up 208%.
NEUT20|So those full year numbers will be an interesting watch.
BULL21|We've also got half year numbers coming from another stock, which is flying.
NEUT22|That's accardo.
BULL23|They're up 56% in the year to date they had had first quarter sales, which were up 10% but indication of their present strength is at second quarter sales were actually up 40%.
NEUT24|Obviously they've got the retail operation.
BULL25|They've also got this increasingly successful solutions business where they're basically outsourcing that technology, particularly on an international front, and indeed.
NEUT26|They raised Â£1 billion, ingenious or replacing to help fund that solutions part of the business.
NEUT27|Finally, there is a trading update from Burberry.
BEAR28|This stock has been rather up against the wall.
BEAR29|Unfortunately the shares are down 30% in the year to date, although up 43% since its March lows.
BEAR30|This is obviously a company with exposure to the Asian economy, which can be a plus and minus on the one hand we continue to continue to see political considerations holding back the region.
BULL31|On the other hand, the economy itself does seem to be coming out of the coronavirus quite strongly.
BEAR32|The Chinese market has been on something of a tear recently.
BULL33|Having said all that, store closures nonetheless will have hit Burbridge numbers hard, and with that retail part of the business being so important, it will be interesting to see just how Burberry have managed to fare.
NEUT34|Thank you for watching.
BULL35|"Have a great week."""
