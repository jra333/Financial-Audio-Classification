NEUT0|"""How's it going guys?"
NEUT1|Today we're going to talk about Crowd Strike now before we get started, I will let you know that today at 9:12 AM or yesterday for watching on the 10th of December, we.
NEUT2|Purchased two put options, naked put options and we also purchased a couple of.
NEUT3|Call spreads.
BULL4|Parish, of course for CRC, RWD or Crowdstrike now these have been very very profitable for us as a matter of fact, and this spread, we've already recognized almost 70% of our intended profit, and on these two naked puts which we've already sold, we recognize 117% return, which is really really good money in a very very short period of time.
NEUT5|So let's talk about how we knew this was going to drop.
NEUT6|Why was on a radar, and how we knew.
NEUT7|When to get in and get out.
NEUT8|As you can see, this is the daily chart for crowd Strike.
NEUT9|Now of course, this is the today's day.
NEUT10|But if you notice before that we've seen up trans happen day in and day out.
NEUT11|And we've done videos about this as a matter fact every Wednesday and Sunday I hold his strategy session at 9:00 PM, where you can also learn some of our strategies.
NEUT12|And of course we have our live trading call everyday at noon, but we highlighted some of these movements in crowd Strike.
NEUT13|It was looking kind of, you know chedid not moving as much.
NEUT14|We needed some real action and we were anticipating it come today, so let's take a look at the five minute chart and you'll know exactly what we're talking about.
NEUT15|So the five minute chart right when the market opened, it moved on up.
NEUT16|This is where we started buying some of our options that you saw that the time periods around 9:12 it was right over here.
NEUT17|So as soon as I started getting rejected, we started purchasing.
BEAR18|Now we knew then come back down here and hopefully get rejected again and drop.
NEUT19|And that's exactly what happened.
BEAR20|Came down rejected offer moving averages came back down, rejected again, and then of course that big dropped.
NEUT21|I just took it out and made us 100% return just from here to here.
NEUT22|So it was a quick play.
NEUT23|Easy play as a matter fact, I've told we were talking today and I kept saying specially when this is moving up.
NEUT24|Crowd Strike is the perfect setup.
BEAR25|There's no way this is going to run up today.
NEUT26|It's going to fall just like how Snowflake did the other day we knew was coming.
NEUT27|We just have to have some patience and let the market work it out.
BULL28|So we made a quick profit 117%.
NEUT29|It came up on our scan and of course if you want to be part of our group to get ahead of some of these trades, know what we're doing.
