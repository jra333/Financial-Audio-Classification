NEUT0|"""OK, let's take a look at Netflix."
NEUT1|Netflix been trading within this training band for the last couple months.
NEUT2|Between the price of 176 and 198, I was essentially you're looking for it to either break the 198 and come up to fill this 205 gap, or if the 176 and come down and tag this 140 area.
NEUT3|As you can see from the chart last Wednesday it found the book to the 176 and work itself down to this.
BEAR4|164 before I found some support and when it tried to retrace back it also encounter assistant near the 171 and 170 area.
NEUT5|So if we take a look at the intraday chart here you can see that Wednesday last Wednesday book this 176 came down this 164 before it when we traced back up an account with system that the 171 then later on it make another we trace him back up and it found.
NEUT6|Resistant at the 170 area.
BEAR7|Also on last Friday trading you also encounter resistance on way up at the 170.
NEUT8|So right now it seems to have some resistant set up near this 171 and 170.
NEUT9|Oh in addition to that, last Friday it's kind of sitting around this 170.
NEUT10|I mean this 164 support area for a little while before not yourself up too close to that.
NEUT11|165 to pin.
NEUT12|Some of the option or weekly option expiration now next week could continue to balance and I click work itself back up to this five day year may before it encounters some resistant and possibly retrace back below it if it does and it break below the 170.
BULL13|Again, there's a good possibility it will come back down and we test this 164 for support and I do expect it to eventually break this.
NEUT14|Support area of 164 and work yourself down to that one 4140 area so we go back to that daily chart here.
NEUT15|This is the 140 area that I'm looking at but before.
NEUT16|Work yourself down to this 140 there's a possibility that it might get a little bit of a balance here that 152, which is the level from this measure.
NEUT17|Move of the trading band here so that give me a 152.
NEUT18|Measure move projected price chart target so it's just a little disclosure.
NEUT19|I do have a short position on Netflix and make sure that if you plan to.
NEUT20|I have a short position on Netflix to exercise your stop because there is a pretty high short interest on Netflix or a short squeeze.
NEUT21|It's a it's a possibility, so if that does occur, you want to make sure that you have your stop set to avoid unexpected big losses.
BULL22|"So good luck to you on your next week trading."""
