BEAR1|So looking at the daily timeframe here again is heading back to three or Lowe's after failing to overcome resistance at 117.76 last week by the price has also returned below the Middle Bollinger Band of the RSI has bounced on the 50 neutral mark and put back into the bearish area.
NEUT2|So the short term risk is currently.
BEAR3|Looking negative and that increases the case for a retest of the September low of 115.85, which was somewhat restrictive recently as well.
BEAR4|If that obstacle proves fragile, then we could move straight to the three year low of 115.43.
NEUT5|How are any step blower would clearly reactivate the long term downtrend from the 2018 highs.
BEAR6|However, to get a more aggressive cell of the price should break below the 2017 low of 114 point.
BULL7|84 which may take us towards the 112 area I know in the positive scenario, that pair should run back above the Middle Bollinger Band and more importantly close above the 117.76 resistance to extend the rebound.
BULL8|Probably up 218.55 slightly higher.
BULL9|The 119 level may add some pressure as well, so you get a positive picture in the short term.
BULL10|The repair should rally above 121.10.
NEUT11|So that's all from me.
BULL12|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
