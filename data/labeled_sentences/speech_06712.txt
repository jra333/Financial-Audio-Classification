NEUT1|Today will be looking at NZD USD on the daily chart.
BEAR2|So zooming in we can see that Kiwis, negative impetus has abated slightly after a strong plunge and sellers seem to have taken the bench for a breather.
BEAR3|The 200 day simple moving average is defending the positive structure while the dipping 50 day SMAP is nearing a bearish crossover of the 100 day Smad who's upward trajectory starting to wane.
BEAR4|The diving each more clients are signaling that negative momentum is set to resume while the short term oscillators are reflecting.
BEAR5|A decrease in the price is down with potency.
BEAR6|Immediate downside friction may commence from the zero point 6942 low before sellers face that 200 days may reside in at Zero Point 6876, which also happens to be the 61.8% supernatural trace meant of the upper leg from Zero Point 6510 to Zero point 7464.
BEAR7|Should this barrier fail to negate the recent decline from the multi year high of Zero Point 7464, the price may challenge the key 0.68 handle before meeting the 76.4% football of Zero Point 6734.
BULL8|If by an interest intensifies, quick resistance could develop from the zero point 7032 obstacle and the red tensions in line at Zero Point 7057, ahead of the 38.2% fib of Zero point 1798.
NEUT9|Should buys ignore the yet to be confirmed?
NEUT10|Restrictive trendline.
BEAR11|They may meet a resistance zone from Zero Point 7135 to Zero Point 7179.
NEUT12|Located between the 150 day Smas.
BULL13|Gaining further ground, the section from the 23.6% fib of Zero Point 7239 until the Zero Point seventy 306 high could prove to be a heavy boundary to overcome.
NEUT14|Summarizing and that EU SDS short term picture remains skewed to the downside.
BEAR15|an A successfully completed bearish crossover of the 100 day SMAD may reinforce this outlook.
NEUT16|That's it from me.
BULL17|"Have a great trading day."""
