BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|My name is Joe.
NEUT2|Today's February the 18th.
NEUT3|I wanted to touch base on Butterfly Network ticker symbol BFLYI had a few questions and wanted to provide an update.
NEUT4|So currently we have the price at 2683.
BULL5|It's up by about 2.02%.
NEUT6|So somebody is asking why it was going up yesterday.
BULL7|I think it was up by about 5.9%.
BEAR8|I had a target of about $25.00 so it's way past the target.
NEUT9|And I'll provide some reasons why that's the case.
NEUT10|So those who haven't checked the other video.
NEUT11|I have 200 shares.
NEUT12|Average cost is 1635.
NEUT13|A map by about 62%.
BEAR14|The volume actually has gone really up, so right now it's about 2.21 million and the market cap is 4.2 billion.
NEUT15|52 Week high was 2913, which was pretty much today because it opened at 2616 and you know?
NEUT16|So we'll be looking forward to.
NEUT17|Getting that in a couple of weeks depending on other factors and how the market is.
NEUT18|So I think the market is kind of down today, but I wanted to provide an update on this company.
NEUT19|One 'cause I can invest has invested in this company.
NEUT20|We had already factored that when we provided the $25 target, but yesterday Kathy would had an interview with CNBC and that's why you know.
NEUT21|When she mentioned the company, we saw, you know Spike, nothing else.
NEUT22|You know, kind of points to something besides that.
NEUT23|So I will say most of the things have been factored in the fact that Melinda and Bill Gates are investing in the company.
BULL24|Everything is already factored in and I'm still maintaining that target, even though it's nice below because I feel like it will consolidate and I wanted just to provide this quick update.
NEUT25|As for those who are asking and.
NEUT26|Wanted to see if they could get in.
NEUT27|I will say just wait for the dip if you want to invest in the company long term.
NEUT28|Another reminder I'm not a financial advisor is just for streaming purposes only.
NEUT29|Consult with a professional and always do your own due diligence.
BULL30|Thank you so much.
NEUT31|Big Re be safe.
NEUT32|"See you next one."""
