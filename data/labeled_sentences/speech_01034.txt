BULL0|"""Good morning everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to live trading action by any money stocks.
NEUT2|My name is Nick Santiago.
NEUT3|Today is February 2nd, 2017.
BULL4|Thank you all for tuning in this morning.
NEUT5|Today we're going to take a look at a company you all know pretty well.
NEUT6|It's called Phillips 66.
NEUT7|This was a spinoff few years back from ConocoPhillips and what you're going to see here is.
NEUT8|This is basically an oil refinery play.
NEUT9|They do make specialized chemicals as well.
NEUT10|This could be a beneficiary from the Keystone Pipeline approval so.
NEUT11|What you want to do is look here at the daily chart and what you're going to see is the stock.
NEUT12|Put a top in in December.
BULL13|That high was made right around the $89.00 area.
BULL14|Stock is now trading at around 81 bucks, hitting its daily chart 200 day moving average.
BEAR15|Anytime you pop and drop and you start to consolidate, you're generally going to go lower now.
NEUT16|This company does report earnings tomorrow, so you gotta be a little bit careful, but here's the play on it.
BEAR17|If by some chance this stock trades down after the earnings announcement.
NEUT18|And comes down to this 200 weekly chart moving average.
NEUT19|This is where you want to be involved in a name to the upside.
NEUT20|So I would be a buyer right down here into this 200 day moving average on the long side.
NEUT21|Let me show you why.
NEUT22|If you just go back.
NEUT23|And you look going to July 1st week of July of 2016.
BEAR24|What you're going to see is this stock had a sharp, sharp sell off.
BEAR25|Then it based in a bearish manner and then it broke back out.
NEUT26|So that tells us right in?
NEUT27|Here is where the institutions want to buy the stock.
NEUT28|And in fact if you look back here, this is where they supported the stock.
NEUT29|This is where they supported the stock and this is where they supported the stock.
NEUT30|So we know in this general vicinity this is where the institutions are going are going to try to support the stock.
NEUT31|Now, what better place than the 200 week moving average?
NEUT32|That's where I would be a buyer of PSX Phillips 66.
NEUT33|So again, looking to buy Phillips 66 on weakness here if it gets down to that 200 week moving average, keep it on the charts.
NEUT34|That's how I'll be playing it.
NEUT35|And again, we'll see if that does get down there tomorrow morning when the company does report earnings.
NEUT36|Now.
NEUT37|With that being said, if you want to come over and train alongside of us, take a 7 day free trial to the Research Center.
