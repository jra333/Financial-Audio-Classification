BULL0|"""Hello everyone and thanks for tuning."
NEUT1|Back in all this under the crypto here, let's have a small update here on the Bitcoin price because we dropped the right now below the $7000 and after this move it's normal that we're seeing the Bulls showing up here and buying back up.
BEAR2|These dip.
BEAR3|The thing is that we are now oversold in the one hour and 4 hours, so we might see here another retest of the previous support.
NEUT4|Which now is acting as a resistance in theory, so maybe the price could go up to $7040 before a continuation of this dump.
BULL5|If this is confirmed, dump because in this area we already have been two times and you can see that we came straight back up after these steps.
NEUT6|So the question is, are we seeing now something similar because in this area here we had already some price action.
BEAR7|We dipped a few times below here and also we got immediately.
NEUT8|Back into the channel that we were in before.
NEUT9|So are we.
NEUT10|Seeing now a huge dump here towards 5800 or an maybe another V formation like we had two times already.
BEAR11|This is now the big question, but we have to see what's going on in the next couple of hours because this is for sure not a good sign.
NEUT12|If we go again down here and the retest, this lower region down here, especially if you're going to take out this load that we had here at 6400.
NEUT13|If we're gonna go below 6400.
BULL14|Then I think that it's almost confirmed that we also go down to test at the $5800, but if we're able here to create the first time, a higher low, that would be a bullish sign.
NEUT15|But as it is right now, it doesn't look so good.
NEUT16|And this is right now really the last hope to have a bounce because you can see that we came straight down here to the bottom in the Bollinger Band, the Daily Time frame.
NEUT17|So let's see what's happen if you took a short up here then congratulation, I didn't trade because I wasn't on my computer and it just came back here right now.
NEUT18|But if you still want to open a long or a short, be careful.
BEAR19|Maybe we have to wait till we have more data here, maybe another couple of hours, because right now it looks like that we may be going to create even here rising which, which is a very bearish pattern.
NEUT20|But we have to see we still have not enough data.
NEUT21|We really have to wait and see what's going on in the next couple of hours.
NEUT22|That's why if you already in profits in a trade then congratulation.
NEUT23|But chasing right now.
NEUT24|I think it's a bit dangerous, but if you want to do so, you can go of course over to buy bit and trade here with along with a short.
NEUT25|So if that's the case I'm going to wrap it up just small update.
NEUT26|"Thank you for watching and we see us all in the next one, bye."""
