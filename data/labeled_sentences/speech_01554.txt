NEUT0|"""Alright, pizza watching the options market as always what he got for speed."
BULL1|I got a great one for you, Scott.
NEUT2|I think you're going to be excited about this one Disney.
NEUT3|Now Disney has made this unbelievable epic run to the upside.
NEUT4|Obviously because of streaming, but take a look at what we're seeing here today.
NEUT5|18,000 of this Thursday's expiring options were bought today at the 180 strike that the stock was trading 178.
NEUT6|They're buying the one 80s they started off at $0.70, paid up to $1.50, but that wasn't the end of it then.
NEUT7|They also were buying the 177 1/2 strike calls that are just in the money.
NEUT8|As well, about 8000 of those, so we've got a buyer of those that both expire on Thursday.
NEUT9|Expiration is 31st, of course, so be careful of that very, very short term.
BULL10|Scott, I love this.
NEUT11|I had to jump in.
NEUT12|I love this name.
NEUT13|I love this name for a long period of time.
BEAR14|I jumped out because I thought it was getting too stretched.
NEUT15|It might be a little stretch, but I'm back in the options right now like 79 bucks was the low on this name Pete and it's 179 now.
BULL16|That's just remarkable.
BULL17|Yeah, it was.
NEUT18|It is remarkable.
NEUT19|I remember saying once anything under 100, you got to buy, but unfortunately that when I was still owning the stock, I think I got out about 1:45 something like that and watch this move to the upside.
NEUT20|Now I'm back in it with these calls, so I'm a little excited.
BULL21|"I think we actually have a little upside."""
