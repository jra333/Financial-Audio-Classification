NEUT0|"""It's not investing."
NEUT1|It has very little to do with investors.
NEUT2|It has a lot to do with the.
BEAR3|Actually, the poor mechanics of this instrument, because if you're going to do these different futures or they can risk, they can tell you how much risk there is.
NEUT4|But the fact is a market does not.
NEUT5|This market doesn't produce even more tulips.
NEUT6|And let's say it was that analogy, but you can't find supply, so they have to reach until supply is felt.
NEUT7|But that's not investment.
NEUT8|That's just poor mechanics of an instrument, right?
NEUT9|But this is a mania, is it not?
NEUT10|Yes, it was we we could.
BEAR11|Joe Kernan was asked me about the whole size of it and that's a problem.
NEUT12|I mean, one of the things you could say about this is it's going to be a a trillion dollar market an it's at 250 billion.
NEUT13|It has to get to a trillion before people realize you know what.
NEUT14|I've made a huge amount of money and put bears, make money.
NEUT15|Bulls make money, but hogs get slaughtered.
NEUT16|There seems to be no element of pig ishness among the virus.
BULL17|The level I. Brent mentioned earlier ending the year at 2,000,000 at this at this rating, pace of gains would exceed the value of all US listed market cap.
NEUT18|Well right now, that's well, it's it's.
BEAR19|It's ridiculous.
NEUT20|It's not.
NEUT21|It's absurd.
NEUT22|Yeah, yeah, well, but are you going to give people Bitcoin for the Holidays?
NEUT23|I don't have any to give.
NEUT24|I thought about it.
NEUT25|I thought about the idea.
NEUT26|Let's say you bought him for the Holidays.
NEUT27|Would you flip them because you made so much money on that present that you really don't want to wait a second?
NEUT28|You're going to give?
NEUT29|Can you give them tenths and hundredths of a Bitcoin cash, right?
NEUT30|Yeah, Bitcoin.
NEUT31|What about the binding of Bitcoin?
NEUT32|What about these reports, Carl?
NEUT33|That's going to use enormous amounts of electricity to myself through the.
NEUT34|Yeah, the draining of the power grid we member couple years ago we mined some with John Steinberg here on set in the electricity requires to keep the computers cool from all this.
NEUT35|Data mining is high.
NEUT36|Well this is member.
NEUT37|It's a rivalry among Lisa Su at Advanced Micro and Jensen Wong.
NEUT38|At NVIDIA, who've got the really there like Levi Strauss?
NEUT39|They're like the guy they're like arms merchants.
NEUT40|They have.
NEUT41|They have the pics and they have the shovels.
NEUT42|Well, they're selling to the blockchain.
NEUT43|Is the whole Pete blockchain infrastructure right?
NEUT44|Well, I mean Venezuela.
NEUT45|There's just a huge number of people using these cards to try to find more Bitcoin.
NEUT46|Remember, this is one of the least functional markets I've ever seen.
NEUT47|Don't have alot of supplied people don't understand how supply comes in.
NEUT48|Everybody who's in it says block training so secure they act as if you know.
NEUT49|Look, this is nothing other than watching of nuclear weapons where you know ZTA and you have to have all these different nothings more secure than this.
NEUT50|Some people who might be in reach me out reached out to me about blockchain for Dummies because they the all of the penumbra around Bitcoin is to say this is the only true currency.
NEUT51|Now there are people are going out and saying the truth, which is what happened to gold.
BULL52|Now we find 1% more gold per year.
NEUT53|So it's got that characteristic, but there is a lot of gold, at least around so it can have a parabolic move.
NEUT54|We're not finding 1% of Bitcoin, and you're apparently we're just not getting that new supply of bitcoins.
