NEUT0|"""Largest theater chain in the world."
BULL1|AMC just got a $100 million shot in the arm, but is it enough to keep the chain afloat?
NEUT2|Yahoo Finance's Sibylla Marsellus joins us now with that one bill.
NEUT3|That's right, Alexis, so AMC Entertainment has been tapping capital markets several times this year as they've been trying to survive the coronavirus pandemic and all the restrictions and the shutdowns.
BEAR4|Now, as you pointed out, Alexis AMC is one of the biggest movie theater chains in the world, and they've really had a hard go of it.
NEUT5|So we've seen Hollywood delay major blockbusters by a couple years to later next year to try to save money there.
NEUT6|And we've also have Warnermedia there.
NEUT7|The major movie studio that made the biggest, boldest move by announcing that in 2021 all their movies are going to debut in the movie theater but also on the very same day on HBO Max for subscribers for free, so that sent shockwaves in Hollywood.
BULL8|So AMC is just trying to deal with all those headwinds and what we know they announced today that they've secured a commitment for $100 million of new first lien debt financing by Madrid.
NEUT9|Capital Management now mudrick they specialize in investing in distressed credit so as a part of this deal, what they're going to do they already own.
NEUT10|Secondly, notes issued by AMC.
NEUT11|So there gonna be converting $100 million of existing AMC debt into common shares.
NEUT12|They are also going to be issuing 21.9 million shares as a part of this deal.
BULL13|Now, what's really important here, Alexis is that AMC is looking for liquid ITI and hopefully with this deal they'll be able to achieve it.
BEAR14|But they obviously have a lot more headwinds coming.
NEUT15|In 2021 I want to get back to that HBO Max debacle for the entertainment industry.
BEAR16|I know that some of the big Hollywood heavyweight agencies are really upset about this and they actually wrote a letter.
NEUT17|Did they write a letter to HBO?
NEUT18|I mean, to to Warner Brothers about this.
BEAR19|Yeah, so we're seeing a lot of heat being brought on to Warner Media.
NEUT20|And obviously AT&T is the owner of Warner Media as as a company.
NEUT21|Basically for this decision.
NEUT22|It's the boldest and it's kind of like Warner Media has taken the lead.
NEUT23|Another movie studios are just sitting back and seeing how this goes.
BULL24|But yeah, we're seeing Warner Media basically making a major play for their subscription service.
NEUT25|They want to expand HBO Max.
BULL26|This is definitely a great move for them, but we're seeing is that major.
BEAR27|Talent agencies in Hollywood and major movie stars are upset about this because they feel like their compensation for those movies is going to be cut if their movie is going to both be at the movie theater at the same time that it's going to be on the subscription service.
NEUT28|So we're really seeing reverberations about this.
BEAR29|And a lot of Hollywood stars and their agents upset by Warner Media's decision.
NEUT30|But we're seeing order media, not step back.
NEUT31|They're pretty much going to move full full speed ahead.
NEUT32|AT&T Warner Media basically focused.
BULL33|On growing their subscription service.
NEUT34|That's what it's about for them.
NEUT35|Alright, so Bill Marcellus.
BULL36|"Thank you."""
