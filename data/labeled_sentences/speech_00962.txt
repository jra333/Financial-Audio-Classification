BEAR0|"""Well, amid the talk of cracking down on speculators in the commodity markets, one very popular ETF has hit a brick wall markets editor and Cinco has a story in the US that gas fund."
NEUT1|And yeah, Betty, the US Nat gas fund is getting caught up in that discussion in Washington over how to crack down on commodities speculators.
BEAR2|You know, the story here is that US Nat gas fund said yesterday in the afternoon that it had run out of shares.
NEUT3|Betty, it has issued all the shares that it could possibly got approval for.
BULL4|And so it's a has an application that it is waiting to be approved so we can increase the number of shares outstanding, but Betty with that speculation that talk in Washington of regulating there is not clear at all that they will get an application to be approved.
NEUT5|So take a look at what has happened here.
NEUT6|You know this problem that they've run into, but it comes as the Nat gas fund is extraordinarily popular.
NEUT7|This is gone from about 100,000,000 shares now to 322,000,000, which is all that they have.
NEUT8|Betty the UNG.
BULL9|The fun they want, more shares, obviously to meet and satiate the demand.
NEUT10|But in order to do that they have to go buy contracts.
NEUT11|Betty, take a look at how much UNG already owns.
NEUT12|They own 18% of the August Nat gas futures on top of that they own 240,000 Nat gas swaps on the ice and another 51,000 swaps on the Nymex.
NEUT13|Making them one of the biggest Nat gas holders and perhaps speculators.
BEAR14|"If the regulators have changed in the Nat gas market, Betty OK and you."""
