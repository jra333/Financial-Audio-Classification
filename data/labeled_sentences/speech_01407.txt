NEUT0|"""Let's summarize where we've been."
NEUT1|We're starting with the stock market.
NEUT2|When's it a good bet?
NEUT3|When isn't it?
NEUT4|Well, one thing you definitely want to avoid.
NEUT5|Is the kind of debackle we had.
NEUT6|Whenthe.com bubble burst and the stock market collapse.
NEUT7|And So what we've done is we've taken a look at a broad sweep of history here.
NEUT8|And we've said to ourselves, well, what can the stock market history tell us?
NEUT9|Can it show us how to avoid trouble in the in the future?
NEUT10|And So what we did was review the record.
NEUT11|And what we found.
NEUT12|Was that?
NEUT13|We have a measure of speculation.
NEUT14|Called the price earnings ratio.
BULL15|And when the price earnings ratio rose to unusual levels in the 1990s.
BULL16|That told us that the stock market was marching forward much more rapidly than the earnings.
NEUT17|Of.
NEUT18|The underlying firms.
BEAR19|And that tells us that investors were overconfident.
NEUT20|In the kinds of gains from.
NEUT21|Productivity improvements that and efficiency improvements that the personal computer revolution would be.
NEUT22|Would bring.
BEAR23|Anso one the stock market collapsed finally.
NEUT24|Be 'cause those earnings gains just.
NEUT25|Weren't as rosy as speculators at hope.
BEAR26|When the stock market finally collapsed, it brought about in the.
NEUT27|Years since the collapse.
BULL28|Since the year 2002, a much healthier growth in the stock market.
BULL29|Earnings have grown beyond the level that they had once reached and still stock market investors haven't pushed.
BEAR30|The stock market well beyond the peak it had reached in the year 2000, so investors have been more cautious.
NEUT31|And much less willing to bid the value of stocks up.
BULL32|"Beyond the level justified by current earnings."""
