NEUT0|"""Hello welcome this technical analysis for April 24th, 2018 and Christina, Bethany, investment analyst at exam.com and they will be looking at the Australian dollar versus the US dollar on the daily chart."
BEAR1|So the dollar was increasingly bearish the past three days are breaking below the 50 and the 20 day moving average lines as well as closing below the 78.6% fibo Nachi of the applet from 0.75 to zero point 8130.
BULL2|Five, which was more or less support for the market the past couple of weeks in the short term, however, we might see prices rebounding because both their scientistic plastics, such as that the market might be trading near oversold levels, they are size around 30, while stochastic soundtrack to form a bullish cross below 20.
BULL3|So expect the market to post some gains in the short term, but in overall it could maintain this downtrend since the 20 day moving average.
BEAR4|Negatively sloped below the 50 day and 200 day moving average lines while Mcatee down here continues to stretch downwards below 0.
NEUT5|So I move to the upside.
NEUT6|Could retest the 78.6% of all natural Zero Point 7635 further above.
BEAR7|We have the 20 day moving average around the zero point 77 key level which is slightly below the 61.8% fibo Nachi of Zero Point 7742 while a strong resistance is likely to come.
BEAR8|At the 50% Fibonacci of Zero Point 7817 because any substantial closer Bob from here and there for above the 200 day moving average could resume this short term uptrend from the 2 1/2 months log zero point 7642 breaking the bullish sentiment back to the market.
BULL9|However, if prices extend lower, instead the 4th month low of Zero Point 7576 rich today could be met.
NEUT10|First thought with the market fails to hold.
NEUT11|Above these levels are the next stop could be probably at the 0.75 are key level.
NEUT12|I know about the medium term picture.
BEAR13|The pair is bearish since the download pattern has started at the end of January still in place.
NEUT14|But we also have prices below her.
BEAR15|The 200 day moving average which gives some negative signals for the long term.
NEUT16|So the risk in the medium term is more likely to be on the down side rather than on the app side.
NEUT17|So that's all from me.
NEUT18|Thank you for watching.
BULL19|"Have a great day."""
