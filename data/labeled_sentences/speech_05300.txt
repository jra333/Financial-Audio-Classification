BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about Amazon so Amazon sells books and you know some other stuff.
NEUT2|They're totally not a global retailer for pretty much anything current stock price $3093.00 which gives them market cap of $1.56 trillion which is, you know quite abit revenue.
NEUT3|$386 billion with earnings of $21 billion.
NEUT4|So obviously they've kind of abandoned their policy of never making a profit ever.
NEUT5|But it's still not a lot.
BULL6|So that gives them a PE of 95 with a forward P of 61, so quite decent growth there.
BEAR7|And obviously the revenue growth of 3035 is present is quite nice, dividend is zero.
NEUT8|I don't expect that to change.
NEUT9|Especially considering the balance sheet, but that's a different story.
NEUT10|Total assets $321 billion.
NEUT11|Total liabilities $227 billion, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $93 billion, which again is like 7% of their market cap and half of their.
NEUT12|Annual run rate like not even that, so obviously I don't really like the balance sheet, but it's also hard to build a balance sheet if you have a policy of never making a profit ever.
NEUT13|So there is that still risk factors.
NEUT14|They're kind of in the business of disrupting other industries, so I wouldn't really consider them to have any risk factors.
NEUT15|Kind of getting to the point where there could be smaller players kind of interfering, but.
NEUT16|Overall, it seems like Amazon is so well run that it's hard for people to break into their business because of the economies of scale.
NEUT17|So overall, I really don't think there's a whole lot of risk factors to talk about.
BULL18|So for a growth investor, they're still 35 ish percent growth even with the revenue of $386 billion or $280 billion.
NEUT19|If you want to look at it that way.
BULL20|So the revenue growth has been going on for a long time and it's still up there.
NEUT21|So for a growth investor, I think it's definitely worth looking into.
NEUT22|PE of 95 is not actually that high for growth stock so.
NEUT23|I think it's definitely worth looking into.
NEUT24|Obviously for a dividend investor, there's nothing here for a value investor at the balance sheet is not great.
NEUT25|The P is way too high and I'm not sure if the growth actually makes up for that so.
NEUT26|If you're a value investor, I would think that there's better opportunities out there for like strict value investing, but I think it's still worth a look.
NEUT27|That's it for me.
