NEUT0|"""OK, in today's video we're just going to take a quick look at Disney."
BULL1|After we did have a nice rally, we had to pull back so we have to look at a new decision here that comes from taking 100% of these two prior swings projected from the recent high.
NEUT2|And then it actually overlaps a 618 retracement of the prior swing.
NEUT3|So if price can hold above this general area, one 2467 to 125 eleven.
NEUT4|I want to go down to the lower time frame chart and look for by triggers.
NEUT5|The risk would be either underneath the low made prior to your buy trigger or underneath the low end at the zone which would be underneath one 2467.
NEUT6|Now if this area does hold and does trigger.
NEUT7|Then what you would expect actually, let's see if I can get this here high to low.
BEAR8|The potential upside target off of that area is going to come in at one 3301.
BEAR9|I am wrong on this set up?
NEUT10|If this area breaks, OK?
NEUT11|"That's it."""
