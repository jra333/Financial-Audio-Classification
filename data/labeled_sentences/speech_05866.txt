BEAR0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the S&P 500 and you can see that we are struggling here."
NEUT1|At the 3400 level.
NEUT2|As I record this.
BULL3|Impressive bounce, though.
NEUT4|The question is, can the market sustain this?
BEAR5|This is a 50 day ma that has caused this bounce and quite frankly an oversold condition from the short term.
NEUT6|But the question now.
BEAR7|Are people going to use this pop to dump stocks that they are in a bad way with or are they going to hang on?
BEAR8|Ironically, if we see this market go straight up in the air, that's actually a bad thing.
BEAR9|And the reason I say that is that the volatility has been a major problem with stocks as of late, and I think that is going to continue to be the case.
NEUT10|So therefore I do not like the idea of getting too cute with this and trying to just buy and hold.
BULL11|I think you need more stability.
NEUT12|These types of moves typically don't happen in a vacuum.
NEUT13|You can see even here.
BEAR14|Even though we rallied, we kind of drifted back to tend to lose again to make sure it was support.
NEUT15|"So at the very least, I think you would have to expect something like that being neutral, great position to be in right now."""
