BULL0|"""Bitcoin is booming, but that doesn't make it an alternative to the dollar yet."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL2|Will you get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world?
NEUT3|Bitcoin is the new darling of investors.
BULL4|It is rocketed since March from $5000 to over $40,000 before pulling back a bit.
NEUT5|Fans are predicting the rise or zoom and that this cryptocurrency is headed for $100,000 or higher.
BEAR6|People are piling in because of a lack of faith in government currencies.
BEAR7|The Federal Reserve and other central banks have crushed interest rates and are printing unimaginable amounts of money to pay for covid relief measures and to stimulate damaged economies.
BULL8|Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are now seen as a respectable investment class and financial institutions are adding it to their portfolios.
NEUT9|Enthusiasts say Bitcoin is the new gold and that will eventually replace the dollar.
NEUT10|Not so fast whatever Bitcoin is, it is not money.
NEUT11|We use money to buy products and services.
NEUT12|The dollar for instance is like a claim check for a car or a coat or a ticket to an event only in its case you can use it to purchase or sell just about anything.
NEUT13|Money works best when it has a stable value.
NEUT14|While there are stories of vendors willing to accept a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, these will remain Curiosity's until they are stable in value.
NEUT15|Contracts are essential for an economy where there's buying a house with a mortgage, leasing a car, purchasing insurance and countless other activities.
NEUT16|Who in their right mind would sign a long term contract based on Bitcoin?
NEUT17|So you took out a mortgage in March for $250,000 today.
NEUT18|You know the bank almost $2,000,000 with Bitcoin at stake.
NEUT19|One day dog food the next and caviar the day after.
BEAR20|Another problem with Bitcoin is that it has a fixed supply.
NEUT21|The amount of it cannot be increased.
BULL22|By contrast, the supply of money must be able to expand to meet the growing needs of a growing economy.
NEUT23|Between 1775 and 1900, when the US went from a simple agricultural based economy to the mightiest industrial nation of the world.
BULL24|The supply of dollars went up 160 fold.
NEUT25|For crypto currencies to seriously challenge existing money, they must be as easy to use as money is today, and they must be fixed in value.
NEUT26|Preferably the gold or something like the Swiss franc so they can use them for contracts.
NEUT27|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL28|"Thank you for listening to send in your comments and suggestions and I look forward to being with you soon again."""
