NEUT0|"""Building root was like a treasure map, and you know when you start a journey you may have a good idea of where you want to go."
NEUT1|You got a rough direction, but not everything is on the map.
NEUT2|No map is perfect and along the way you can find hidden gems.
BEAR3|You can also run into storms.
NEUT4|I think really a success of your journey is based on how quickly and how nimbly you can react on those things that you find along the way.
NEUT5|That's really what we've found as a company.
NEUT6|I am Alex Tim, co-founder and CEO of Root Insurance.
NEUT7|Auto insurance really doesn't work for the consumer.
NEUT8|It works for the insurance companies.
NEUT9|We saw that as an opportunity to rebuild insurance with the consumer in mind first, this was really a brand new thing that we had bought up together and we thought we could build something really special for consumers in the beginning.
NEUT10|It's rough, you don't have anybody with you.
NEUT11|You know the bank accounts going to run dry and a matter of months, not a matter of years, and so you start to say, how do I?
NEUT12|Start to just prove out a couple of my fundamental problems there to figure out the technology is to figure out the consumer, and then you sort of get the right to work on the next biggest problem, which for us then was actually making a consumer facing app.
NEUT13|Can you get consumers to do this thing?
NEUT14|When we launched the product it was just pure nerves.
NEUT15|You sort of all this excitement you're finally going to launch the product or finally going to see what consumers do.
NEUT16|An.
NEUT17|I'll be honest, nothing happened.
NEUT18|Crickets I don't think I ever stopped worrying about the viability of the product, but what it did is it drove me to focus really, really intently on.
NEUT19|Well, can I just get 10 people to use this product and then now, how do I get 10 more every week?
NEUT20|We started with this incredible small scale and just this incremental thinking and that allowed us to get early feedback and then improve and tweak the product.
NEUT21|And every single week we were shipping different products until eventually we started to notice, hey, this thing is starting to work.
NEUT22|When you start to see all of those things, start to work.
NEUT23|That's when you really feel like OK, I've got something, so I think I doubted myself the entire time.
NEUT24|It's certainly a conflict, and sometimes in those really hard times, all I could tell myself was just don't quit as soon as I've decided I won't quit, then doubt was just a fun, useful emotion.
NEUT25|I never thought it was fair the way the existing system worked.
NEUT26|You could see that car insurance was essentially a tax on the poor.
NEUT27|That was something I wanted to change and I wanted to give consumers back the power.
NEUT28|"And that's really what we're doing."""
