NEUT0|"""Well, let's take a look at the Apple stock and we can see here today to form the green candle."
NEUT1|This green candle has a real body.
BEAR2|It means the closing price is lower than the opening price, so it's a bearish sign for the Apple stock, especially with the smaller volume here.
BEAR3|And also we can see the momentum is weak, even though it's still above the year may.
BULL4|And also we can see today the whole SP 500 has jumped 2.6.
BEAR5|But the Apple stock only have a 0.76 is very weak compared to the whole market is also a very site.
NEUT6|If we change it to the day chart we can see here.
BEAR7|Actually, it had been dropped down.
BEAR8|Hold away till the close of the market, so it's also a bearish side.
NEUT9|So in my opinion, hold your money and see what will happen today.
BEAR10|Market has tell us that it's very weak.
BULL11|"Thank you."""
