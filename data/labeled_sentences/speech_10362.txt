NEUT0|"""But back to Apple Jim, what about the?"
NEUT1|You know, I continue to wonder about the risk of China.
NEUT2|We talk about it all the time.
NEUT3|Of course, the escalating tensions between the two countries, the importance of China, Apple's overall business, but just take something like the App Store where they're getting pushed back here in the United States.
NEUT4|There are a lot of Chinese app.
NEUT5|Makers that are also paying the 30% told to AUS company you know you do wonder, Jim.
NEUT6|It's at what point the Chinese government may try to crack down on that well, but against that you're getting this new theme that Waway is hobbled by what President Trump is done.
BULL7|Making it so that actually Apple is doing better in China than it should.
NEUT8|And now that is something that it's a new new rap.
NEUT9|It's kind of an aggressive rap I think.
NEUT10|But as someone who has said own Apple don't trade it.
NEUT11|What's been vindicated by the stock price, obviously.
NEUT12|I always have to worry about China because the Communist Party is very mercurial.
NEUT13|Add some people, feel it.
NEUT14|The Communist Party at any given moment is going to shut this one down or Nike.
NEUT15|And yet Nike and Apple are two of the greatest performers, in part because there's this short and cover shorten cover.
NEUT16|Shorten cover by people in the hedge fund community who have been overrun by Robin Hooters.
NEUT17|Robin Hood truly is take from the rich hedge funds and re distribute to the poor.
NEUT18|Quality is.
NEUT19|It's an app name to call it Robin Hood 'cause.
NEUT20|It's certainly not Lennon.
NEUT21|"It's more Robin Hood."""
