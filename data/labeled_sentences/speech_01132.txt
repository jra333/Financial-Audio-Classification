NEUT0|"""Hey, it's calling this via video chart on ticker symbol ARLO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Did this one previously, Ann had a very very impressive day today.
BULL5|Although we got a little bit of confirmation in terms of levels that I talked about previously and that big bit of confirmation comes via this red line right here, which I talked about in past videos at $7.30.
BULL6|Now to give credit where credits through the price was able to actually, you know, be strong enough to push up through that level.
NEUT7|The problem is the price was not strong enough to actually stay above that level and then back down the price went.
NEUT8|Now that doesn't mean that this thing is going to crash or that this thing can never get up above that area.
NEUT9|I'm just saying we again have confirmation that yeah, that's apparently going to be.
NEUT10|A very stubborn level which makes perfect sense.
NEUT11|You go back to the history of things and you can see Price struggled.
BEAR12|Price struggled an once again.
NEUT13|Price struggled right there, so you're just going to get more eyeballs watching that area, but that will definitely be an important level to watch moving forward from the resistant side of things.
BULL14|Now in the event, the price can actually work its way back up that area.
NEUT15|Get the break above it and stay above it.
NEUT16|Then at that point the next key area of resistance becomes up there.
NEUT17|At $7.75, but no, no need to put too much focus on 775 until the price can first prove itself in near term and one final time, no quote, unquote, prove itself being defined as being able to get above and stay up above that $7.30 mark as far as levels of support and concern.
NEUT18|Nothing new here to report, just confirmation again that the level still pertain.
NEUT19|First, the level of support to watch is going to be that green line there at $6.50.
BULL20|So good to see that the price closed nicely up above there, even with the pull back.
BEAR21|You know it's not like the price is threatening to break down below that level.
NEUT22|So from the highs all the way down to where it closed until got wiggle room before that level would even be tested and then after 650 the next level of support then keep an eye on would be that purple line there the 50.
NEUT23|Moving average which is currently valued right there at will call it $6.25.
BULL24|But All in all nice movement today.
NEUT25|Not just a question of can the price get the break up through that area of resistance on Friday.
NEUT26|Let's see what happens.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
