NEUT0|"""What's up everybody welcome channel?"
BULL1|I've been awesome.
NEUT2|New plan for you guys today.
NEUT3|I'm going to talk about draft Kings.
NEUT4|The stock the business is about as it is.
NEUT5|So where is it so far this year in 2021 and where I think it's going to be awesome video.
NEUT6|I can't wait to get into it to start off most you guys aren't subscribed so hit the subscribe button.
NEUT7|Right now take a little bit of the awesome.
BULL8|We really helps out grow the channel and I can make more great content for you guys day after day so please describe right now to kind of help us.
NEUT9|Boost our channel if you want to watch more videos like this about draft Kings.
NEUT10|So First off I usually go in Stockton like I talk about my personal opinion.
NEUT11|So of course I'm going to stock right now.
BEAR12|DraftKings overall, 52 week Low is 1060 and it's been two week high is around $64 a share and right now it actually just passed $50 share.
BULL13|So pretty solid trends and a nice steady incline during the whole procession and covid low.
NEUT14|That a lot of people, a lot of businesses it did feel so.
BULL15|Overall, it's been going up quite significantly.
NEUT16|Just to clarify, I've never been into sports betting and watch sports kind of casually.
NEUT17|I'm not really that into any particular sport for viewing, and I don't bet on sports, so I'm definitely a demo for DraftKings.
NEUT18|At the same time, I am supposed to be because I'm younger.
NEUT19|They said their demos around 1 E 235 year old men that watch sports.
NEUT20|I'm in that demo and I don't feel the need to spend money on this product, so just to lay that out there just to make you guys consider maybe OK. Maybe this isn't for everyone.
NEUT21|NPS won't scale, but if you're into sports betting your independent, this is definitely one's going to look at because it's almost legal in every state and drag things the company is actually banking on states or the United States.
NEUT22|The whole legalizing sports betting just nationwide.
BULL23|And obviously that would help increase their revenue and overall marketshare.
NEUT24|Having all legal sports betting.
NEUT25|Another reason I'd be kind of cautious when investing in draft Kings is because one of their biggest competitors is Penn National Gaming.
NEUT26|Yes, the company that bought a portion of Barstool.
BEAR27|And yes, the business that their code lower under $4 a share, and currently there prices around $90.00 a share.
NEUT28|So you're asking for the one that's going to be the most returns over this past year.
NEUT29|It's definitely not draft games because Penn Ash Gaming is absolutely exploded this year because their barstool branches just really driving sports traffic.
NEUT30|Driving that blog in that blog is actually perfectly bring people over to the bedding.
BULL31|Yes, DraftKings does have a little bit of a deal with ESPN and Disney to kind of get their product pushed.
NEUT32|On ESPN, but overall having having that exact demo that Penn National and Marshall having that young men's in the US audience is going to help them grow into the brand and eventually that would then later on.
BULL33|So I do think that's why the stock has exploded because they've had a really really solid fundamentals and pen might actually be a better alternative to draft Kings.
NEUT34|If you guys want to see if it about pen, please come down below and I can agree with pen and why that's a little different.
NEUT35|Draft Kings and what makes them unique.
NEUT36|Overall, that's kind of my take on DraftKings.
NEUT37|Pretty quick video.
NEUT38|It's pretty.
NEUT39|Easy concept is kind of betting on sports to make money and they take a percentage of each bet, so it's not too hard rapper.
NEUT40|Head around and obviously the US change regulations.
NEUT41|That's going to change at all.
NEUT42|Personally, I'm not investing in the stock and I don't own any of it at the moment.
NEUT43|The only way I would actually invest in stock is it hacked itself drowned $25 a share which is the last time that was May 8th ish.
NEUT44|So I don't really see the need to buy it right now.
NEUT45|But if you guys are interested in draft Kings also come with that and absolutely destroy the like button for this video exactly see.
NEUT46|When you guys like or dislike about videos so I can actually really start producing content that the majority you want to watch are interested in watching, I'm just around the Internet so don't necessarily take everything I say is 100% accurate because I don't have any credentials at all, so you're watching me for random advice.
NEUT47|"Just going to clarify that everyone stay safe out there pizza."""
