BEAR0|"""Virgin Galactic this stock is my on a tear it's it's shooting up if I could."
NEUT1|Be so bold now look what I go into Twitter and I say look.
NEUT2|This is a short squeeze.
NEUT3|People say Oh no it's not a short squeeze.
NEUT4|I would tell them their ill advised mean.
NEUT5|This is what happens when too many people want to stock around the Clock and you know this thing was at 12.
NEUT6|No ones going to Mars that I know of but it can't be stopped right now an these things tend to end badly but you try to tell someone that they think that this is Tesla.
NEUT7|They better put these guys better.
NEUT8|Put someone on Mars like yesterday.
NEUT9|This guy's a charm guy remembers Virgin Galactic.
NEUT10|There's nothing he can do that's wrong, right?
NEUT11|And he is Indian Angel or something.
NEUT12|He's like an otherworldly guy.
NEUT13|There's a level of bubbling of belief that you know what if we don't want to buy Chinese stocks, we can go go to the moon with Virgin Galactic.

NEUT22|And there's also a degree of.
NEUT23|I mean, what's really ailing Apple?
NEUT24|It's hard to get a whole pass to go outside your house.
BEAR25|Now when I see the streets of Beijing being completely empty and there's good story in Financial Times about how hard it is to get workers there, I find it hard to believe that everything is going on.
NEUT26|But I also find that out of date.
NEUT27|I'm not going to say the markets wrong.
NEUT28|I'm going to say I'm out of date.
NEUT29|There are people who are buying Virgin Galactic and I can't tell them not to.
NEUT30|What do you do tell?
NEUT31|"What are you going to tell him that we're not going to Mars someday?"""
