NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, Jason Moser here with Brendan Matthews joining you for another edition of ask a fool where we answer your questions today we're taking a question from Steven and Steven asks what are good stocks for young investors who have time to wait the market out."
NEUT1|I currently own blue chip stocks.
NEUT2|Are there slightly riskier options that fall into the buy and hold category for 40 years?
NEUT3|Brennan first let me just say Steven, 40 years.
BULL4|That's great.
NEUT5|I love that your perspective.
NEUT6|Brandon, what do you think?
NEUT7|What are some ideas that we might be able to Stevens way?
NEUT8|So one that I think that you can really almost literally hold for 40 years would be CarMax.
NEUT9|Yeah, so they have the nation's leading used car dealership, but they only have a small share.
BULL10|The market something like 3%.
NEUT11|I think that they could have, you know, five times more stores than they have today, they're really revolutionizing the industry.
NEUT12|That's the company I would like to hold for a decade or even longer.
BULL13|So I think I think that's a great one.
NEUT14|I would recommend Steven checks.
NEUT15|Check that out if he's looking for something that is.
NEUT16|A little bit more high risk, high reward right now.
BEAR17|I would see him towards wisdom tree investments, so it's a sponsor of fundamental ETF's and they've sort of hit a stumble in their growth in the past couple of quarters.
BEAR18|And that's sort of caused investors to trade the shares down.
NEUT19|But you look at this company's market opportunity.
NEUT20|It is in the trillions.
NEUT21|It's founder LED.
BULL22|I think that that could be a great winner if you are able to hold onto it and wait it out.
NEUT23|But Jason, what do you think?
NEUT24|What are some high risk, high reward stocks could be held for that would be great for an investor with a long time long time horizon.
NEUT25|Yeah, I think first and foremost you want to look at leadership where this is concerned because you want to make sure you have a leadership team in there that you know in theory should be around for awhile, right?
NEUT26|I mean, if we're talking 40 years, let's assume we even cut that in half.
NEUT27|Anywhere from 20 to 40 years.
NEUT28|I mean, I think that something out there, a lot of people, probably saying is overpriced.
NEUT29|Today.
NEUT30|Is Chipotle Chipotle Mexican Grill.
NEUT31|Mexican Grill is a really interesting story today because of the fact that they have so much room to grow that namesake store base along with the shop house concept, along with the Pizzeria Locale concept, and you have the founder of the business who is also the Co CEO Steven.
NEUT32|Else you have the other Co CEO.
BULL33|Monty Moran is a wonderful operator.
NEUT34|They're younger guys, I think right around 4748 years old, which which tells me they're probably going to be there for a little while, and so I think that when you can look at holding onto a stock like that for.
NEUT35|Makes 20 thirty 40 years.
NEUT36|That certainly mitigates maybe a little bit of valuation risk today and then if you're looking for a little bit of a spicy or meatball and we talk a lot about here is inven sense because it's playing into that not only mobile technology but wearables as well.
NEUT37|Along with this whole runway we see for the Internet of Things, I think that inven sense to volatile holding.
NEUT38|It may be one that really doesn't even last 20 to 40 years.
NEUT39|I wouldn't be surprised to see someone snap that thing up at some point.
NEUT40|It's one I own and I think that it's certainly worth a look today.
NEUT41|Definitely high risk.
BULL42|But certainly the potential rewards as well.
NEUT43|So I like your point about management and it makes me think of another company that I think would be a great long term holding, and that's Markel.
NEUT44|Oh yeah, Markel is a Richmond based insurance operation.
NEUT45|They still mainly specialty lines and they've got they've got a great set of leaders now.
NEUT46|But I think they have a great set of upcoming next generation leaders and Tom Gayner on the investment side there, Chief Investment Officer and then Richie Whitt, who runs a lot of their insurance operations.
NEUT47|I could see them being with that business for the next 20 years.
BULL48|Leading it onto really strong returns for shareholders.
NEUT49|Correct me if I'm wrong here, but you own shares of CarMax.
NEUT50|I do.
NEUT51|You own shares amarkhel I do you share the wisdom tree?
NEUT52|I do my own shares of Chipotle own shares of inside also ensures amarkhel, so I think we're kind of talking book around.
NEUT53|This is for us.
NEUT54|I think this is an important subject.
NEUT55|We approach investing a very much the same way with a long term perspective.
NEUT56|So great, great question.
BULL57|Thanks a lot.
