NEUT0|"""Hello guys, thanks for your time again today I have some interesting analyzes to start your week and I will see you after the intro."
NEUT1|Thank you.
NEUT2|Now we will move to check the chart of Amazon stock.
BEAR3|So first of all, I believe that we have this configuration of the butterfly pattern, but in most cases when we have this pattern here, the market should go down OK, but Amazon stock choose to do this correction after touching this stronger resistant level.
NEUT4|Which is 3250 approximately OK, so after the rejection over the upper trendline, now I'm talking about this one which acts as a resistance.
BEAR5|Also, the market will break the moving average.
NEUT6|Here the yellow line and go down to test the lower front line.
NEUT7|It will go until this point here.
NEUT8|But we may have a pull back because remember that the trend is your friend.
NEUT9|OK, so we may just have a pullback here, but this point already is our target.
BULL10|So, just to summarize what we said, there is a very high probability that the market will touch this level if we have a view up strong breakout here.
NEUT11|In the middle blackline, so we need just a very big read engulfing candle that will break it with force or with energy.
BULL12|To confirm our forecast OK.
