NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will now.
NEUT3|In this video I will be going Oval over Marathon digital ticker symbol M Ara.
NEUT4|OK now I will be giving you guys one key level.
NEUT5|I'll be getting shares at.
NEUT6|Which will also kind of be like a support low as well, but there is a support level above my bind level.
NEUT7|OK, so I'll give you guys those two levels and I don't see any resistance levels above OK until price starts coming down because it didn't make it all time high.
NEUT8|So without further ado, makes you guys smash that like button and subscribe, and also turn publications so you don't miss any updates and also join the free Discord is the first Discord link and it will be free for option bias alerts from April to May 1st.
NEUT9|OK, so make sure you join that.
NEUT10|I think we will be doing a limited amount of people.
NEUT11|I don't have that number yet, but it will be limited so you don't want to miss that.
NEUT12|Now support level 'cause you can see price kind of stalled up here, right?
NEUT13|Came up right, rushed up, went down, came up but kind of came right back to what the price was yesterday.
NEUT14|OK yesterday's close price was 48 and today's closing price was where is it?
NEUT15|4885 so it only moved $0.85 within these two days, right?
NEUT16|It looked like it did more but you gotta look at the end game for both.
NEUT17|OK so I really don't move that much.
NEUT18|I do think it does want to come down.
BEAR19|And now the levels that I wanted to come down.
NEUT20|This is the first level that we could see some support at, and this is 4591.
BULL21|4591 is where we could see some support.
NEUT22|Right, so first you want to watch this level as price comes down, you want to see that this access support or if it falls through OK, it did close around 45 I mean 4885 and it is kind of flat.
NEUT23|Kind of like in between.
BEAR24|So not really moving as you can so kind of went up.
NEUT25|Came back down to the closing price.
NEUT26|So this is your first support and then where I'll be looking to buy now at this by level 45 will be 44.
NEUT27|.30 right there.
NEUT28|So at this by level I would not put 100%.
BEAR29|I'll probably put around 50 to 60% because it could drop a little bit low.
NEUT30|This I do have another buying target that I'll probably put the rest of for 50% on for the position that I want to have in stock and I'll just give you guys arrange that between 40 to 42 that I'll probably put the rest of position on between here, but for here I'll put 50% just in case we do get that pop up and you guys know my minimum is 10%, so 10% would be.
BEAR31|To around 48 I say above 48 OK, so just in case we get that pop here, I'll be looking to exit around 48, but if it keeps dropping down and I start averaging down here, then I'll probably looking to exit back around 46.
NEUT32|OK, but again this is a support level 4591 watch price here.
BULL33|If we do start seeing some Brian pressure here, probably put on about 30% here.
NEUT34|OK just in case it falls below and hit this level then I'll put about the rest of the position on and I won't get in down here because it has both these levels.
NEUT35|It might want to hire.
BEAR36|So for right now I am bearish on this stock 'cause I want to fall down to my levels and then once it's my levels I'll be bullish.
NEUT37|OK, so remember, notice the recommendation of bias or anything?
NEUT38|Just verification purposes only for?
NEUT39|"Do not trade anything you see here in these videos and I catch you guys in the next one by."""
