NEUT0|"""I wonder if you think that lead this morning is are these loss provisions, especially at JPMorgan."
NEUT1|Well look, I I, I am surprised positively and I think that what's happened is people aren't spending that borrowing a credit card losses final.
NEUT2|This small business loans.
NEUT3|I don't know where the people are that they're not suffering.
NEUT4|This is.
NEUT5|It's not a happy days are here again, just maybe.
BULL6|JP Morgan's landing better now.
NEUT7|I will say this and David knows this.
NEUT8|There will be a call that goes on simultaneously when we talk about it and that call is going to take the wind out of our sails, David.
NEUT9|If we say something really positive because they'll be one comment and let me some comment that comes out in that call and this happened again and again, which is made us pull in our horns.
NEUT10|I'm frantically trying to figure out which one they're going to say.
BEAR11|That is not great.
NEUT12|Then I do my background call with City.
NEUT13|It's cities quarter looks amazing, and you've got the $71.95 book value and it scrub book value, but that seems to be impossible.
NEUT14|So David, you know in this day of days that you and I always just like 'cause we're going over these quarters.
BEAR15|There's something in these numbers that someone will not like and that is typically sent JPMorgan down in city with.
BEAR16|It has not been able to keep a lead that's for sure.
NEUT17|Neither one of the stocks, even during earnings days.
NEUT18|You say I remember the last last quarter.
BEAR19|It appeared that they were both quite strong, but they did not stay strong in terms of the stock market.
NEUT20|At least Jim to your point.
NEUT21|Sometimes it is comments on the calls as you say, that perhaps are more concerning.
NEUT22|We don't know what's coming.
NEUT23|We don't, and they don't when it comes to.
NEUT24|To future provisions for loan losses.
BULL25|But that said, I mean, JP Morgan is actually releasing a lot of reserves.
BEAR26|The provision came in well below it had been anticipated.
BULL27|The weakness that you've been concerned about his not showed itself.
NEUT28|It wouldn't seem on the consumer or even on the corporate front.
NEUT29|Not that we were expecting that much there.
NEUT30|It's just not there, Jim, not to mention of course, deposits are extraordinary, of 28 percent, 28% of JP Morgan.
NEUT31|I think what was it?
NEUT32|1617 at city?
NEUT33|I think yeah.
BEAR34|I mean, people aren't spending and therefore their balance sheets are getting better.
NEUT35|That's something I did not count on.
NEUT36|That, and one reason it didn't count Enquanto make this clear is the Fed scared that.
BEAR37|Scared the living daylights out of me.
NEUT38|One of the things that they have said is listen.
NEUT39|You can't buy back stock, dividend boost and they ignored what might be happening at the bank.
NEUT40|Says they did not want a repeat of 2007, 2008.
NEUT41|I did not ignore what they said.
NEUT42|I I say, OK, listen if they're so nervous they've seen this and they either haven't seen it or they're ignoring it.
NEUT43|This is this is the kind of thing if you're Republican center right now.
NEUT44|I think you can go say to Secretary Manoosh and.
NEUT45|What do you need here?
NEUT46|I mean you kidding me, this is these are banks that are doing better than ever, so it's ammo in favor of no stimulus.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
