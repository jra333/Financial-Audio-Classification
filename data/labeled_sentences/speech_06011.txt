NEUT0|"""His claim this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also with claimers standpoint.
NEUT5|I do own Amazon from the long side in my retirement account, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis here.
NEUT6|Well, I mean the the obvious but it will anyways to build some context.
BULL7|But overall a very nice move on this one when you think about the fact that just on Monday the price was flirting with these lows and now it's done, it's worked its way back up to that area.
NEUT8|Don't get me wrong, there's still work to be done, but overall.
NEUT9|Nice move here, but that does lead to the more than valid question of, but is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT10|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea, but by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
NEUT12|In that area is down here at.
NEUT13|The 3125 Mark Wise 3125 important and I'm not saying that all of this was going to happen, but just for explanation.
NEUT14|Say if the price were to come down to that level, behave in that manner and then continue on down.
NEUT15|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT16|Well, that would quite literally putting the price right back inside of the range of the chart that it just broke out from.
NEUT17|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where it was not exactly sounded true.
NEUT18|Power true strike.
NEUT19|Now to be fair, no pricing goes straight up, so maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner.
NEUT20|Then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now then what would you have while you have a set of those right here?
NEUT22|You have that set of those down there.
NEUT23|If you envision each one of those as their Subs, well, hey there we go.
NEUT24|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT25|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT26|That's what a truly strong move is going to do.
BULL27|It's going to make progress forward.
NEUT28|So in this situation, like I said, keep an eye very closely on the 3125 Mark.
NEUT29|As far as areas of resistance are concerned, it is all about.
NEUT30|The Purple Line there right now, which on my charge you know it's a very well known the very famous 50.
NEUT31|Moving average.
NEUT32|If the price push pushes up above there though, the next key, overarching level of resistance, then watch very closely would be right up there at the 31.
NEUT33|Let me make sure I got that right, the 3180 Mark.
NEUT34|So 3180.
NEUT35|Next key level resistance.
BULL36|Assuming of course the price can break above that purple line there, but overall nice little bounce here.
NEUT37|Now it's just a question of can the price build upon the momentum moving forward.
NEUT38|Let's see what happens.
NEUT39|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT40|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT41|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL42|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT43|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT44|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT45|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR46|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT47|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT48|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT49|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT50|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
