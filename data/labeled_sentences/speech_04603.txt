NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol kosc."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day, so lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance just from a trading jargon standpoint, this is what would be known as the gap in trap.
NEUT6|If you're maybe not, or maybe neuter charts and not very familiar with some of the lingo.
BEAR7|But GABA trap just means that on Friday the price closed right there and then this morning the price opened up there, so that's a gap up.
NEUT8|And in this situation a very big gap up and then this is where things get Savage 'cause.
NEUT9|The opening Bell Rang.
BEAR10|Some poor souls were buying up around here and then from that point it was just basically all selling pressure.
NEUT11|The rest of the day.
NEUT12|So that's the gap in trap that took place, which now leads to what I would definitely consider a muscled area of support.
BEAR13|And that area is down here at a dollar three now.
NEUT14|Why is it dollar three important?
NEUT15|I'm not saying that all of this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT16|If the price were to come down with dollar three behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT17|Well, that would quite literally be put in the price.
NEUT18|Right back inside of this range that it just broke out of and I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sound true.
NEUT19|Strength of true power or anything like that was.
NEUT20|On the flip side of things, if the price were to come down here, behave in that manner then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here you have this set of those down there.
NEUT22|If you envision each one of those as stair steps, well hey there you go.
NEUT23|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT25|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
NEUT26|It's going to make progress forward and in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined.
NEUT27|Right there around that green line.
NEUT28|On the flip side of things, if the price decides it wants to start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT29|First key area of resistance than any sort of attempted movement backed up side going to be right here at the dollar 17 mark and then if Dollar 17 things spaced out a bit and get up into the dollar thirty.
NEUT30|But let's just first see if this is a healthy consolidation or not.
BULL31|But on all rough looking chart right now, things are looking shaky, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around.
NEUT32|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT34|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR38|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT41|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT44|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT45|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT46|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT47|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
