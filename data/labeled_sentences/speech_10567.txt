NEUT0|"""Jim Cramer joins us now to talk all about it."
NEUT1|What do you do?
NEUT2|What do you do with the Nicola?
NEUT3|Would he do even with the GM?
BEAR4|Well, look, I think that there's a lock up expiration that the numbers that they're selling are much fewer than they could and a lot of that and Trevor Milton's not consulting nearly as much as I thought, but I kind of felt from that interview.
NEUT5|There was just such resistance even talking about the idea that there could be something good going on.
NEUT6|Now this is a deal that, frankly is not significant, and I know the people don't want to hear that there's a lot of people in Nicola hoping that this is the.
NEUT7|Big score, it's just not the big score.
NEUT8|Andrew it's not like Mary Barra said.
NEUT9|You know what?
NEUT10|I really like this technology very much and I think some of that is because the company is not particularly been the kind of company that GM wants to align with.
NEUT11|How about that?
NEUT12|I think that's fair.
BEAR13|Perhaps many people think it was ill advised if they went with Nicola Fullbore.
NEUT14|So they have this deal and the deal is kind of an Astra steel.
NEUT15|I don't think Mary Barra wanted to be able to say, hey listen, I'm Nicholas best partner because.
NEUT16|Nicole is not going to be anybody's desk partner.
NEUT17|They're just they haven't delivered the way that people thought.
NEUT18|And you want to hear that they kicked out Milton, but that is not happening.
NEUT19|Instead, you heard.
NEUT20|Kind of what I would describe as being a not clear approach to who is still at that company.
NEUT21|I want to hear how much Trevor selling and then we'll be able to make a better determination, but to me it's not about.
NEUT22|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
