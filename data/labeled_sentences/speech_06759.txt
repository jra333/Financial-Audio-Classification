NEUT0|"""Hi this is Rich Ross of Evercore, ISI for CNBC."
NEUT1|And today we're going to show you why we're buying dips in Netflix.
NEUT2|Let's go to the chart and we'll show you why this is a stock that can trade $180.00.
NEUT3|So here's the setup.
NEUT4|We see this very nice advance really coming right out of that presidential election.
NEUT5|You see that strong move.
NEUT6|Now.
NEUT7|This is the key to this setup.
NEUT8|Let's call this bottom 110.
NEUT9|Into 142 now.
NEUT10|Remember that that's $32 or 32 points.
BULL11|We settle into a textbook flag formation here as the stock consolidates in sideways fashion and then finally that culminates in this big bullish breakout here yesterday of roughly 5%.
NEUT12|You can see that right there now.
BULL13|The stock settled back just a bit today as we consolidate that big gain trailing the NASDAQ 100 by about 50 bips this morning.
NEUT14|But that's your opportunity.
NEUT15|You want to buy.
NEUT16|Any weakness as that big breakout consolidates so that thinking is that the flag formation flies at half mast roughly halfway within the move.
NEUT17|So we take this move 110 to 142.
NEUT18|That's about $32.
NEUT19|As we said, we tack that onto the breakpoint at 148 and it gives us that measured upside target of 180.
NEUT20|So with the stock in and around 151, I'll take that.
NEUT21|I'm a buyer of Netflix on any weakness ahead of a strong move.
