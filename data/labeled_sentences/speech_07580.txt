NEUT1|Walt Disney Co. Sleeping Beauty bonds.
NEUT2|This case analyzes the biggest bond issue in the history of $300 million bonds by Disney with a maturity period of 100 years.
NEUT3|The coupon rate offered to the bondholders was to be 7.55% and the bonds were callable bonds.
NEUT4|This is quite rare that companies issue bonds which have a duration which is higher than the average life expectancy of individual show ever.
BEAR5|Disney and Coca Cola have both issues.
NEUT6|Such lands with a maturity of 100 years, although the goal of the company is to grab profits from the high demand in the market.
BEAR7|However, the longer duration of these bonds also makes this risky for Disney.
NEUT8|This case analyzed a number of considerations and also compares the returns of the bonds with the returns of 10 year bond and the common stock of the company.
