NEUT0|"""What are the yields tell you know, I love in the back."
NEUT1|Nobody talks about this, but Page 4, page 5 of a Weinberg note, always canvases yield what is yield?
NEUT2|Tell you right now.
BULL3|Well, I mean, yeah, let's tell us that the Fed is hiking rates and that's putting some upward pressure on yields.
NEUT4|Yields are telling us that there is risk in the markets right now, and we're seeing in Europe in particular.
BULL5|A good bid on bonds in general other than Italian bonds, which is where the risk is emanating from.
BULL6|And we're seeing, though a general rise in yields, which tells us there's some concern about inflation.
NEUT7|Probably driven by oil.
NEUT8|And that ties into your story this morning about Saudi.
NEUT9|Let's go to chart long term back Carl noses chart.
NEUT10|This is the way economists look at the markets so much.
NEUT11|This is yield back 60 years.
NEUT12|Here's the Volcker, Pika, yearly inflation and the yield ten 1112% down we go.
BEAR13|Have we broken trend?
NEUT14|I'm not so sure.
NEUT15|We broken trend not yet, not yet.
NEUT16|And you know, we certainly will it some point.
BEAR17|Yields can keep on falling forever.
BULL18|Fed tightening probably will push up yields over time or we're not looking for.
NEUT19|An inverted yield curve in the near term, at least at high frequency.
BULL20|So we see those yields up.
BULL21|The increase is significant.
NEUT22|What to 220 basis points on the 10 year US.
NEUT23|But in Europe, though, we're not seeing it.
NEUT24|For example, in Germany we're still seeing when yields with a four handle to the right of the decimal point, and we still have issues that keep the demand for bonds strong, particularly in.
BULL25|Yeah, and I miss Carl, thank you for bringing us Francine.
BEAR26|I missed the lower German two year yield this morning.
BEAR27|It is ever more negative this morning.
NEUT28|Off the Bavarian elections, I completely missed that.
BULL29|Yeah, it's a good thing you have.
NEUT30|You have people in London actually that also bring up to date with all of the market moves, but Carl overall, it seems like it's a perfect storm 'cause you have these risk events that may be in isolation like the Bavarian elections, the Italian budget, what we saw you know with the Fed that aren't huge but together could create to something that could turn very ugly.
BULL31|Yeah, yeah you know, I think you're right, Francine, I think there's certainly a safe haven flow into bonds there.
BULL32|Also fundamentals in European bonds that I think are supportive.
NEUT33|You know we're talking about.
BEAR34|The ones that are in short supply, the government is running a surplus, so that means there's few of them in the hands of the public next year.
BEAR35|Compared to this year.
BEAR36|Looking at inflation in Germany, where a headline is above target but core is well below target and all across Europe, the inflation target is not been met.
NEUT37|The ECB's probably going to keep interest rates lower longer than the market expects, so there are lots of positives to keep those bond yields down low and bones, of course, are the benchmark, so we'll see variations of spreads against those boons, particularly Italian bonds blowing out.
BEAR38|"But other bonds are moving lower with them, like the French, so it's a complicated story for European bonds, but I think it's still it's certainly not a negative one in the case of Germany, it might even be a positive one even from 40 something basis points."""
