NEUT0|"""Scott, that Warren Buffett said that his company is acquired a slightly more than 5% stake in each of the five leading Japanese trading companies."
NEUT1|They import everything from energy and metals to food and textiles into resource.
NEUT2|Scarce Japan.
NEUT3|Let's talk about this with Todd Rosenthal, Pod Rosenblum, excuse me, head of ETF and mutual fund research and of course we're talking with Jay Jacobs, Senior Vice President at Global X. Todd, let me start with you.
NEUT4|You would see Fr.
NEUT5|A.
NEUT6|You know a lot about this.
NEUT7|The largest Japan ETF that's EWJ has significant exposure.
NEUT8|All five of these companies that Buffett is investing in but outflows have been happening for awhile in that ETF, will Buffett's investment spark more interest in Japan from the United States Investors?
NEUT9|We think it likely will.
BULL10|Yeah, it's a nice tell that the Japanese market has been undervalued EWJ as you mentioned, has been seeing outflows about $3 billion, according to CF rate in the past year.
NEUT11|We've also seen DXJ, the wisdom tree currency hedged ETF for the billion dollars of outflows.
NEUT12|Some of this money collectively is going into the beta builders ETF be BJP, which is a cheaper version of those two.
BULL13|Product, but we do think that there's an undervalued opportunity in some of these Japanese ETS.
BULL14|And as you mentioned, you get the benefits of diversification.
BULL15|Yeah, and say you have got a very interesting ETF.
BULL16|A thematic ETF that's doing terrific this year.
NEUT17|The robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF that's BOTCBOTZ?
NEUT18|Excuse me, 42% of that or Japanese stocks.
NEUT19|I don't think people understand.
BULL20|Japan remains a major innovator in robotics and technical research.
NEUT21|I think that's exactly right.
NEUT22|A lot of people look at Japan and think of this, you know, kind of large but stagnant economy.
NEUT23|That hasn't done a lot in the last 10 or 20 years, and that's actually very far from the truth.
BULL24|There are pockets of opportunity within Japan where they've been very much at the cutting edge.
NEUT25|Robotics and AI is one of them.
NEUT26|I mean, these are leading companies in developing robots that are building automobiles that are that are building cell phones that are manufacturing semiconductors that are building the robots that are going to be delivering towels at our hotels soon.
BULL27|So they're at the forefront of one of the most powerful themes that we see in the market today.
BULL28|"OK, Todd and Jay, thanks very much."""
