NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, this is Mr Talmage."
NEUT1|I'd like to explain to you how to sign up for how the market works.
NEUT2|So you want to pull up Internet Explorer.
NEUT3|Eventually on my blog I have a button for you, probably down here in the important links section.
NEUT4|Until that time, just type in www.howthemarketworks.com.
NEUT5|When this screen pulls up.
NEUT6|Go ahead and click on register.
NEUT7|It's that red word up there.
NEUT8|And then you'll.
NEUT9|Get a screen like this and you're going to sign in for a new account or register for a new account.
NEUT10|From here, just enter your first name.
NEUT11|And then for the email type in your first name at.
NEUT12|Myname.com so first name at mrtalmage.com for the password you can use here.
NEUT13|6 digit number.
NEUT14|It's really important that you always use this suffix for your email address mrtalmage.com, I don't want you to use a private email address then click register.
NEUT15|For Step 2, you're going to want to skip, so for that step, the bonus offers you're going to click no thanks.
NEUT16|Scroll down to the bottom of the screen.
NEUT17|And click no thanks.
NEUT18|So from here you can now log in with your password.
NEUT19|Whatever you set it to be.
NEUT20|Now you'll see your portfolio screen so you can join a contest by clicking right here where it says my contests.
NEUT21|Quick join.
NEUT22|And then from here you want to click on classrooms and private groups.
NEUT23|Then Scroll down to the bottom of the screen, click on show all.
NEUT24|And you can probably search right here.
NEUT25|Let's see I'm going to type in Mr. T first trimester 2009.
NEUT26|See what happens.
NEUT27|Looks like it's located it right here, so you're going to click on Join Now.
NEUT28|And then the private password is SMSEAGLESSMS Eagles.
NEUT29|All one word, all lowercase and click Join Now.
NEUT30|And then you can view the contest.
BULL31|And you can see we have quite a few people already signed up.
NEUT32|Beginning with me.
NEUT33|So that's a little bit about how to sign up for the stock market game.
NEUT34|I will be taking all classes to the lab and making sure that everybody is signed up, but if you wanted to do it, do it from home.
NEUT35|That's how you would do it.
NEUT36|Already.
NEUT37|Have a great day.
NEUT38|We will talk to you some other time.
NEUT39|"Bye bye."""
