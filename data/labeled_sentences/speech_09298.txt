NEUT0|"""On Friday, about CW Curtis, right."
NEUT1|Uhm?
BULL2|As you see, the stock had a nice uptrend.
NEUT3|And it's basically was basing out almost kind of like a Cup without the handle you see, it comes all way down.
BULL4|There is public 14% from its high to its low, so the base isn't that deep and it was breaking out today on huge volume.
NEUT5|Took out the resistance right here.
BULL6|Nice white bar just approaching overbought territory but these things still have room to run.
NEUT7|So I did buy this.
NEUT8|I'm looking for my 1015%.
NEUT9|So yeah, so basically huge volume breaking out here coming up a couple coming out of a Cup, a Cup base, and let's see if there's more room to run.
