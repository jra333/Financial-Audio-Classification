BEAR0|"""What I saw last week and I see today is this parabolic move."
NEUT1|Look Fridays close.
NEUT2|I thought it was what we would call phony mean the big rally please and I didn't think there was anything to it other than short covering.
BEAR3|I think we'll revisit the lows that we saw Friday and then we have to rethink because the selling frankly is too hard this morning.
NEUT4|That doesn't mean that I don't think.
NEUT5|Ultimately the people who don't know what they own shouldn't sell.
NEUT6|I'm just saying this is just trying to find price discovery where we were Friday and then be able to figure out what to do.
NEUT7|David, you know that that kind of rally on Friday based on nothing.
NEUT8|Is really a sign that people are desperate and shorts or were desperate to cover?
NEUT9|Yeah and to your point, trying to sort of figure out where there is a real bottom and if there was one, or is one you know Jim it's funny because somebody build these stocks were all down on no news.
NEUT10|Remember all the days, day after day, after day, week after week after week, maybe even month after month where all these stocks were up.
BEAR11|Unknown news and we just sit here and question their valuations to some extent understanding the underlying businesses were very strong, but nonetheless.
NEUT12|This is the price to sales.
NEUT13|Now this is the price to sales and earnings per share multiples that were, you know, through the roof and here we are now people wondering as they often do well Gee, why is it coming down on no news look, I think it's really important.
NEUT14|I put together a list, had this Cramer COVID-19 index of the winners?
BULL15|You're right David.
NEUT16|I mean are we looking at times earnings?
NEUT17|I mean everything is time sales, everything and what happens when you have that is, is that the value guys, the SNP God not even aesopi names?
NEUT18|They're not going to come in the margin.
NEUT19|Guys are going to get.
NEUT20|Charging down, I'm specifically going to call out the Robin Hood people.
BEAR21|I know that this is something that we're not necessarily a focused on in a sense that there's a broader court than Robin, and I'm using it as a rubric, but many of them are so over their heads that they will get so angry that I said that.
NEUT22|But Carl, I remember in March and April 2000 I remember what it was like.
NEUT23|I know there were a lot of people said, you know what?
NEUT24|I'm a millionaire.
NEUT25|I'm not going to pay taxes.
NEUT26|I'm a millionaire.
NEUT27|Call these people lost everything.
NEUT28|I think it's my job.
NEUT29|Why you follow stocks to say, do you know what the stock is?
NEUT30|I read on Twitter at this weekend that there were some people who just said, look, you know what?
NEUT31|"I love XYZ and when I find out what they do and it's like we have cut it out, don't be so damn proud of knowing nothing."""
