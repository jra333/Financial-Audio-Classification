NEUT1|You know we care really about what are the options that we have for consumers rather than like how and who produces it.
NEUT2|So like Lucifers great show was three seasons on cable TV and then we took it over.
NEUT3|Now it's on Season 5 for us and doing great you is another one that started.
NEUT4|In that case, none Hallmark.
NEUT5|I think it was.
NEUT6|And then you know we took it over and made it much bigger.
NEUT7|And then there's other shows like Stranger Things.
NEUT8|You know that we originate.
NEUT9|Right from the beginning or the Crown.
NEUT10|"So again, consumers don't really care how we do it, but they care is that we have some of the best series and the best films that anyone's ever produced."""
