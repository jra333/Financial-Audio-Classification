BEAR4|As a result, core European bond yields have fallen to new record lows, while UK and US benchmarks are also falling.
BULL5|The race to the bottom among central banks is picking up speed.
BEAR6|Financials and miners are leading the equity sell off.
BEAR7|Banks do not like negative rates and after a brief response on Wednesday, investors are once more fleeing the sector.
NEUT8|The question now is whether we are finally seeing the kind of capitulation that ultimately staunch is.
BEAR9|What has been a brutal sell off since the start of the year.
NEUT10|Is the end showing signs of that capitulation?
BEAR11|Well, a massive rally in the yen suggests that carry trades are being cut as investors head for the sidelines.
BULL12|"The currency surged nearly 3% against the dollar this morning and along with rising equity volatility, this tells us that market stress may indeed be near or perhaps approaching an inflection point."""
