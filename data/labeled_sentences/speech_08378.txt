NEUT0|"""I think there is a lot of momentum around what's going to happen."
NEUT1|It's been several years since the bailouts in the bankruptcies of the General Motors and Chrysler.
NEUT2|They had talked about a tie up in 2008 before the financial crisis really were in the teeth of the financial crisis.
NEUT3|Didn't workout, but this isn't a new idea necessarily.
NEUT4|To consolidate two of the Big Three, Rick Wagner, former CEO of GM, had approached different parties.
NEUT5|There was talk about this when they were stronger, the decades changed a little bit.
NEUT6|You know, a lot of talk about the technology investments that are needed in that you're going to need partnerships.
NEUT7|You're going to need a lot more capital, and you're going to need to spend less money on developing the things that are are kind of today's industry in the future.
BULL8|And boy, it sure would help if you had a really, really strong lock on that pickup truck in SV market in the US, which isn't really going anywhere anytime soon.
NEUT9|So who would you?
NEUT10|Who would emerge as the two players?
NEUT11|So I'm going to channel my inner Sergio Marchione here.
NEUT12|Surge of course, died last year.
NEUT13|I had a lot of conversations with him over the time that he was running Chrysler, his.
NEUT14|Dream target.
NEUT15|He talked everybody right?
NEUT16|And he was very hot on consolidation.
NEUT17|He wants it.
NEUT18|He wanted a partner and and clearly the successors at Fiat Chrysler wanted partner.
NEUT19|General Motors is the company that he would like would have liked to have partnered with and I still think as much as I can think that this is an ideal partner.
BULL20|They would have a very sweet position in the pickup truck market.
NEUT21|There's a lot of synergies there.
BULL22|Obviously GM pulled out of Europe and could use a bit more balance in the global lineup and Fiat Chrysler.
NEUT23|Believe it or not, makes money there.
NEUT24|Well, he brings China to Fiat Chrysler, but they don't have an autonomous GM is making a lot of moves there and Fiat Chrysler needs a partner in that area.
NEUT25|So what would it take for a deal like this to actually go through?
NEUT26|And you know, keeping in mind there's been a lot of other merger.
NEUT27|Talk with Fiat especially, but is there?
NEUT28|Do you think resistance from US regulators?
NEUT29|Is there resistance from the US buying public?
NEUT30|Or is it simply resistance from say, General Motors?
NEUT31|I don't think I think it's resistance from General Motors.
NEUT32|I don't think anybody in the buying public really thinks about who.
NEUT33|Makes the Jeep who makes the Silverado.
NEUT34|If it's General Motors or Fiat, Chrysler or both, their brand loyalty is big.
NEUT35|You know, we've answered all the questions about what consumers care about when both of those companies went bankrupt and they're still selling a lot of automobiles in America and elsewhere.
BEAR36|Whether or not federal regulators would have a problem with this, I think is an old school issue because these two companies combined today have less market share than than General Motors had.
NEUT37|When I started covering them out 20 years ago, so.
NEUT38|They aren't.
NEUT39|They aren't huge players.
NEUT40|Maybe there would have to be some.
NEUT41|Moves made in the pickup truck line up to get rid of one of the brands like GMC.
NEUT42|To assuage regulators.
BULL43|"But really there isn't as much overlap as you would think in the two product lines and they would still have a very formidable competitor in Ford Motor Company right now, which does dominate the pickup truck market in Toyota and Nissan and others are coming in with products that are competitive."""
