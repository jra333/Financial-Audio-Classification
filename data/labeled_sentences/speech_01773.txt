NEUT0|"""My name is Bob Swanson from Phoenix."
NEUT1|And I'm wondering what are the advantages of investing in Berkshire Hathaway as opposed to investing in the stocks that Berkshire owns?
NEUT2|Well, a lot of people do one or the other, and some people do both, but no.
NEUT3|You have to really make up your own mind on that, and we're not going to go to great lengths.
NEUT4|To tell you about everything that Berkshire is doing as we go along an.
NEUT5|There could be some changes and there will be things that can happen in Berkshire that I think you would have trouble duplicating.
NEUT6|Elsewhere, but on the other hand.
NEUT7|You know, if you put all your money in Coca Cola.
NEUT8|Some years back you might have done better than if you put in Berkshire, so we really make no recommendation to what people do with their money.
NEUT9|We do not seek to become.
NEUT10|Investment advisors through in effect.
NEUT11|Our portfolio actions at at Berkshire, Charley.
NEUT12|You're basically.
BEAR13|We hate it when people following us follow us around buying we buy.
NEUT14|Nothing personal, no?
NEUT15|By the way, the questioner before.
NEUT16|This last one asked.
NEUT17|What is the market value under the hammer of all Berkshire's operating subsidiaries, and the answer is, you have to figure it out yourself.
NEUT18|Mr Nice guy.
NEUT19|Yeah, well, but we give you the information.
NEUT20|Incidentally, where your judgment on that should be about as good as ours.
NEUT21|There's nothing mysterious about valuing the Buffalo News, or sees candy or.
NEUT22|Our flight safety or Dairy Queen so.
NEUT23|You really have the same information.
NEUT24|We have in that I mean, if there's if there's material information.
NEUT25|That we aren't giving you about any important but Vercher subsidiary.
NEUT26|We'd like to give it to you because we think you are entitled to have the information enables you to value the various pieces because of the aggregate size of Berkshire.
NEUT27|Now in terms of market capitalization and some of the positions we own.
NEUT28|The smaller subsidiaries really cannot have that much effect.
NEUT29|We love him just as much I I enjoy.
NEUT30|All of the businesses were in and I enjoy the people that they're running, so we don't make a.
NEUT31|There's not.
NEUT32|We don't differentiate in our attitude within the company, but in terms of the actual impact.
NEUT33|On the valuation of Berkshire there are a number that really just.
NEUT34|They just don't make that much difference in terms of figuring out.
NEUT35|Weather Berkshires Worth X or X -- 1000 or plus 1000.
NEUT36|Because 1000 now is over a billion dollars in terms of valuation.
NEUT37|"A billion is still a lot of money."""
