BULL0|"""Everybody thanks for joining me to this video."
NEUT1|Quick video quick update on Apple Stock Apple stock since the virus.
NEUT2|You went down a little bit and now he's going up again, so it seems to be again, a bullish market as we would like always to invest in the market direction in the main market direction.
NEUT3|We should buy.
NEUT4|The idea is that my main concern is that Apple, yes, you're right, is a bullish market right now.
NEUT5|But for how long?
BEAR6|This is ending that I I'm not able to answer and I hope that people will understand that there is a bad.
BEAR7|There's a crisis in the virus in the world.
NEUT8|And then a lot of people is dying and.
NEUT9|I mean, we should understand that there are some priorities and not like a new iPhone or a new Mac book.
NEUT10|But also this is overall human being behavior.
NEUT11|So for a longer term investment, I would wait a little bit even if all fundamental and technical analysis says that the market is going up, I will do it for that because we are human being and help from this virus.
NEUT12|We will understand something and we're not.
NEUT13|We're not.
NEUT14|We're not going to go spend or spirit or just throw away money in in.
NEUT15|In a new phone, if our phone is still working as well as in the new model of a Mac book or whatever, but the idea is that as it is now shorted, the market seems to go along just very excited to wait.
BULL16|The result of this afternoon of the over the earnings report that seems to be good and could result, but not as good as the one of.
BULL17|The same time of the last year, so it's good.
BULL18|It's relatively good, so I think I'm expecting a jump up on the stock is up is already open for for Facebook and Microsoft is going up as well.
NEUT19|So and how much will go up as well?
NEUT20|So why not Apple?
NEUT21|So this is what I'm expecting right now by gain.
NEUT22|Be careful, be careful in it.
NEUT23|Always know this is what the media wants us to do.
NEUT24|All invest.
NEUT25|They want us to invest in those big names.
NEUT26|By and it seems that all even the major analyst then put some target patterns, just watch one of my videos on lesson getting started in technical analysis with our lesson regarding technologies.
NEUT27|So based on this upward channel, the price will go up, bounce back at this level, so even even higher than 310 backups, Triana 20 under $20 and then he can break it, he can break the the upward channel.
NEUT28|Line so anyway, this is my analysis always.
NEUT29|Why would I would not?
NEUT30|I mean, the idea is to invest to go longer now, but just for a short term or long term I will wait a little bit to see more development because I think it makes months six months, one year the stock should should go down or should go in in a in a sideways direction.
NEUT31|It cannot keep growing up.
NEUT32|This is my personal point of view.
NEUT33|I might be wrong for sure, but this is my point of view.
NEUT34|"My my personal point of view, thanks thank you bye."""
