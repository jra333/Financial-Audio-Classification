NEUT9|Breaking down good stocks to buy and I like to make beginner friendly videos.
NEUT10|My videos usually show my dumb stupid ugly face here in the corner but my camera is giving me some trouble today so please bear with me.
NEUT11|Let's go ahead and get right to it guys.
BULL12|From our lows of $0.89 on Wednesday to our highs of $0.95 and AKD ended up pushing up a little over 7% on the day, right and looking at the overall market.
NEUT13|The Mini NACAC the index at the overall market follows.
NEUT14|We had a lot of consolidation on Wednesday, right?
NEUT15|We had low points, high points, low points, highpoints openings, high points overall didn't begin to push up until about 11:00 and going back to NA KD only one day.
NEUT16|One minute chart.
BEAR17|We can see that I also kind of began to push up at about 11 right now.
BULL18|This stock is obviously gained a lot of popularity after the crazy.
NEUT19|Wall Street bets community take over it.
BULL20|We had a level of volume in.
BULL21|We still have a level of volume.
NEUT22|I'm not saying it's as high as that was at one point, right, but if we take a look at these blue six we we do have spikes of volume throughout the day, right?
NEUT23|So we're kind of just cruising here spikes a volume pushups pixa volume push up, right spikes a volume push up.
NEUT24|Overall, looking at it on the 180 day chart, this is the best chart when it comes down to analyzing stocks for the long term, and lets us know where it is that we are currently at and where we are potentially moving next in.
NEUT25|As you can see again.
BEAR26|When the Wall Street bets community, as I'm sure that all of you already know caused an increase in volume, we just absolutely rallied up right and we currently don't have as much volume as we did have before.
BULL27|But we still have a steady baseline that has allowed us to push up, right?
BULL28|Based off of where we're at right now, I would expect any KD to do one of two things kind of begin to consolidate and flatline here around this general area.
BULL29|Maybe around the $1.00 to 97 Cent Mark this cruiser and then find a support which means position itself above this greeness Milan and this blue email and and began to push up.
NEUT30|Overall this is taken into account that the overall market is also cooperative, right?
BULL31|As we have been experiencing a bearish market lately, but I would expect any KD to kind of consolidate and then begin to push up my personal price target for the stock within the very near future based off of where it's at right now.
NEUT32|And what I mean very near future I could.
NEUT33|I mean within the next couple of weeks is I can easily hitting see it hitting around the $1.50 mark $1.60 mark last time it was around this general area in metal resistance, right?
NEUT34|Tried pushing up in metal resistance and then it kind of pulled back.
BEAR35|Kind of consolidated but again keep in mind the overall market has been bearish.
NEUT36|One of the things that I like to remind people is you know if you made an investment in you find value in the company and then all of a sudden it pulls back.
NEUT37|That company didn't become a bad company overnight, right?
NEUT38|Or within a span of two weeks.
NEUT39|It's just that the overall market has been bearish and this is something that we have to take into consideration right?
NEUT40|It comes down to managing risk accordingly.
NEUT41|Also, this is a very cheap stock, so I know that it can be very easy for many of you to get carried away thinking well.
NEUT42|It's only $0.94 so I can buy a lot of shares and make a lot of money.
BEAR43|There is a potential upside and there's a potential downside guys.
NEUT44|Just as you can make more money because you are more heavily invested, you can also potentially lose more money at the end of the day it comes down to managing risk and staying informed on your position.
