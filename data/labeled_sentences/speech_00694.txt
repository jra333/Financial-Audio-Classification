NEUT0|"""It sounds to me a little bit Michael, like you kind of want it both ways."
NEUT1|You say the rule of stocks is by low, but few stocks are low and then you say those stocks are high.
NEUT2|The path of least resistance is for them to move higher.
NEUT3|So what should I do?
NEUT4|Right?
NEUT5|You know this is when you as a as a money manager.
BEAR6|You really feel awful.
NEUT7|I mean, you're always nervous and right now you're most nervous.
NEUT8|Tesla is a great example of the sort of disparity and disruption among stocks, and among that across the index.
BULL9|And for markets, it's been going up.
BULL10|It's over 1300 times earnings for a PE.
NEUT11|We just heard from Bob Pisani that stocks the S&P's trading at 22 will be 22 1/2 times earnings.
NEUT12|That's still 2 standard deviations above the.
NEUT13|Historical average, so for me Tyler, this is a time where even those stocks are trading higher.
NEUT14|It's so important to know what you own and why you own it.
BULL15|Good balance.
NEUT16|Sheet something with really earnings.
NEUT17|Could Tesla keep going the higher yes?
NEUT18|Am I going to buy it?
NEUT19|Not on your life.
NEUT20|Ron, let me let me ask you a sort of a similar question.
NEUT21|You've got stocks trading at records.
NEUT22|You've got some companies as Michael Points out 1300 times earnings, you got specs.
NEUT23|You got IPOs.
NEUT24|Is this going to end well?
NEUT25|Well, some of it won't certainly.
NEUT26|And you know, we've all three of us have been around long enough to know that these episodic periods of speculation, you know, an poorly.
BEAR27|It doesn't seem that the whole market is is excessive.
NEUT28|I mean obviously valuations are high, but that's against zero interest rates.
NEUT29|The Fed's not going to be raising rates anytime soon, which is typically what triggers, you know, full blown bear market unless there's a recession coming and we're not entirely sure about that.
NEUT30|But but yeah, look, I mean, the speculation in specs or in IPO's of some.
NEUT31|You know, unknown quality is ultimately going to turn on investors traders as it were today.
NEUT32|And so yeah, I think there will be a reckoning at some juncture.
NEUT33|But again, Henry Blodgett was on this morning and he said they can go farther and go longer and go higher.
NEUT34|And the old saying on Wall Street is, you know, the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent, so you know that's something that we always have to remember when we're trying to call the top as it were.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
