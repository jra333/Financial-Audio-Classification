NEUT0|"""Skinny and weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 17th of February 2021.
NEUT2|Wednesday, today after week we are at #15.
NEUT3|Units of metric.
NEUT4|Are you nice or unions?
NEUT5|BDC feel like we already kind of.
NEUT6|Coming down for a wave, see yes, this isn't a we go for a B we come down for a C yes and we get a D&E and then boom sayonara by Josh.
NEUT7|If that happens then I guess probably by around summer 2021 you're going to see a super blast off coming for Uni against PDC we don't know yet if that's going to happen.
NEUT8|We have no clear chart patterns pointing towards a BCD, just purely guessing at this point of time if it happens.
NEUT9|Great, this will be the ultimate Chuck pattern for units up against BTC, and so we'll be watching you know busy very closely if it happens, great.
NEUT10|If it's not, then I mean if it doesn't happen then we just have to adapt to the situation, right?
NEUT11|Yeah, so no clear trade workshop items.
NEUT12|We don't know what the human souls are trying to do.
BULL13|We could also be forming a continuation pattern and we could still continue blasting off higher for unisom against PC at this point so.
NEUT14|About going to a treatment to suit all right, let's move onto units up against USD T. But before that please video like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT15|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about you.
BEAR16|Saw in the comments below for Uni against USD T we don't like what we see.
NEUT17|What I mean by that is you could see a higher high on the price but a lower high on the big D. PP low high on the RSI, right?
BEAR18|So this is a double bearish divergance higher price but lower high on the bendy and lower high on the RSI, which means that potentially there could be a new trend change.
BULL19|Doesn't mean it's going to happen because still spike our way up instead of dropping lower.
NEUT20|So yeah, there you go.
NEUT21|We might get something like a descending triangle over here Pop lower.
NEUT22|Yes, we're not entirely sure we don't see any clear tradeable chocolate and four units up against USD T. Not yet.
NEUT23|Hopefully we get it soon, but then again we are aware of a potential trend reversal, so we need to be very, very careful about going long for unisom against USD T. You would also have to be careful about going shot for unisom against USD because there's no clear reversal chart pattern yet.
NEUT24|But if we had to take a guess I think that we could be changing trends right?
NEUT25|If I had a Boo bear slider for Unisource right 5050, I will probably be around 70 bear 30 bull right now.
BEAR26|Doesn't mean we can't go any higher, but you could see the loss of strength on the MIC D an RSI, so the chances of a new trend change is there, right?
NEUT27|Yeah, so be careful about staying do a trick for too long for be careful about going to a trade for units alright, and we could also be wrong.
NEUT28|This could be a you know, even if you do drop, you may not drop that much.
NEUT29|This could be a way for.
NEUT30|And then we go far away fight before dropping for real right?
NEUT31|And so again in terms of trade ability, no clear tradeable shop items for use up against USD T. So be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT32|Alright, I guess it from my unisoft technical analysis.
BULL33|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL34|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT35|"I'll see you in the next video."""
