BULL0|"""Good morning."
NEUT1|This is the NYSE gap open up list basically.
NEUT2|We're looking for the ones that have the bigger ratios, such as MKC 1.45.
BULL3|We've got hyc 1.97 ratio to the gap side.
NEUT4|That means that that's going to go up and what you're going to wait for, and you're going to look for well, we got MasterCard on the leaderboard.
BEAR5|That's a $2.00 gap.
NEUT6|We got AIG.
NEUT7|We did the headlines on that one this morning.
NEUT8|Be able to see that one live they're going to repay the government so that the taxpayers can get their money back.
NEUT9|Well, we'll see.
NEUT10|Let's look at DB.
NEUT11|Anne looks CVD.
NEUT12|So basically Goldman Sachs has got that gap at $1.23 also.
NEUT13|And what we're looking for is, that's a one point.
NEUT14|CVD 2.57 MMG's opening Bell.
NEUT15|We'll see where the shorts come off or not.
NEUT16|Another thing myties on every one of these ratio gaps that you're taught how to do here as an SMF execution is that you're looking for the diminishing the mathematical diminishing factors that play in.
BEAR17|Add one weakness is starting to get in it.
NEUT18|In the name at the highs.
NEUT19|Then it's time for you to be focused on the directional change in movement.
NEUT20|That's our primary focus on these ratio gaps.
BEAR21|Remember they had their previous day's closing price and this is a pre market gap up in price.
NEUT22|So basically, it's not like there's been a lot of buyers and sellers were going to open up the opening Bell will be in 14 minutes and it's 9:30.
NEUT23|So let's take a look at the gap open down.
NEUT24|Let's look at this side of the markets ratio.
NEUT25|Well, looks like we have some.
NEUT26|So basically what you wanna do here?
NEUT27|PRUI think that's Prudential there now.
BEAR28|Negative ratio 2.28.
NEUT29|Me negative 1.52 ratio.
NEUT30|So on the gap downs what you want to do is look for the quality one here, so any would be a good one to look at theirs.
NEUT31|Look for the headline news first.
NEUT32|Add look at Pru also.
NEUT33|On that negative gap ratio and see where the virus come in off that bottom now and walk that tape the other side off of there.
BEAR34|"OK, that's the gap down list."""
