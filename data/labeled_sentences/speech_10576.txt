BULL0|"""In the meantime, we're watching Tesla, which is surging in the premarket on news."
NEUT1|It will be added to the S&P 500 prior to the opening of trade on December 21.
NEUT2|This is among the highest valued companies ever to enter the index in its market cap of about 387 billion.
NEUT3|That's based on the clothes makes it more valuable than 95% of the company is currently in the SMP gym.
NEUT4|If you take current trading into account, of course the market cap is a four handle.
NEUT5|I think they're baffled.
BEAR6|I really don't think they know how to handle this.
NEUT7|What do you do?
NEUT8|How do you kick?
NEUT9|But you can have the S&P 500 only at 497 companies.
NEUT10|Although I've heard people on air sometimes say there are 500 companies in the SB Shocker, I don't know what they would do.
NEUT11|I mean they can't wanna knockout, they cannot got the smallest.
NEUT12|It doesn't do anything.
NEUT13|David, when they balance this I think it is going to be.
NEUT14|They almost seem to have to take make everything smaller.
NEUT15|Right about that I guess, but well, we've talked about though the influence of these mega cap companies on the index itself.
NEUT16|Yeah, for the longest time I always do the distinction between the down the S&P and part 'cause ones.
NEUT17|A price weighted index ones market weighted.
BEAR18|But the fact is that Apple and Alphabet and Amazon and Microsoft and then you get down a little bit alright.
NEUT19|Facebook and then Tesla they have enormous impact on the on the movement of the of the index itself.
NEUT20|It's only what 6-7 companies?
NEUT21|And that's why I think that you see a lot of these younger investors say you know what I'm going to pick the best of the best.
NEUT22|This index doesn't necessarily represent what I want, which is a piece of America.
NEUT23|It represents a piece about seven companies, and I think the younger people are not fooled.
NEUT24|They're not in deceit.
NEUT25|They do like ETF's, but they like to buy individual stocks that they think are going to be right, and that's been their pattern quarrel.
NEUT26|Younger people are really in to certain stocks.
NEUT27|They love.
NEUT28|Neo Prince.
NEUT29|Play you just yawned at my analysis.
NEUT30|I was not on television and it was something I couldn't help but you crush me, everybody.
NEUT31|He's looking at me even though he's talking and I'm not on TV.
NEUT32|An yes I brief catching my breath.
NEUT33|My Neo now that is.
NEUT34|Yeah I was listening to Neo.
NEUT35|Go ahead and tell me about the young people in Neo I want to hear about it.
NEUT36|Talk about, you know the younger people called the younger people are transfixed.
NEUT37|They love to buy Simon Properties when there's good news about retail sales, and anytime that anyone says, you know what I might cruise like Norwegian Cruise lines if they offered, and I think they're going to a test from CVS.
NEUT38|And everyone's got to be tested.
NEUT39|Test, test, test and they come out initial release.
NEUT40|They will buy Norwegian cruise lines.
NEUT41|They are Kings of the obvious.
NEUT42|That's what they like.
NEUT43|They like the obvious Tesla goes up.
NEUT44|Well, let's buy Tesla.
NEUT45|How about hydrogen?
NEUT46|Let's buy hydrogen, do it.
NEUT47|It's like they are.
NEUT48|They're herd animals.
NEUT49|They are herd animals.
NEUT50|Hey, you know what are the Steelers are in first place?
NEUT51|That's why the Steelers, that's the way they think.
NEUT52|They do it Jim, it's working for them.
NEUT53|It is well, that's my .4.
NEUT54|That's why my point is, is that the S&P 500 is old fashioned today?
BEAR55|Just said, but it was a number of months back when we all thought well, we're going to probably watch this new cohort drop off, but they had no.
NEUT56|They're more involved than ever, and they're smart.
NEUT57|And Carl there fun?
NEUT58|They love it.
NEUT59|They love individual stocks.
NEUT60|He's now we keep even though we think that they only love indicies.
NEUT61|Call they love stocks and I think it's fantastic.
