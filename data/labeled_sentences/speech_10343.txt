BULL0|"""I thought the quarter was miraculous."
BEAR1|The numbers are just extraordinary.
NEUT2|Reminds me of Intel in the 1996 to 1998, maybe nine.
NEUT3|When they were doing the 46 the fire and then the Pentium.
NEUT4|David Jensen Wong.
NEUT5|I want you to read this conference call tonight.
NEUT6|OK, I will he actually I do typically try and read them.
NEUT7|You called him Davinci in the past, he's Davinci.
BULL8|You've been a positive on this stock for years.
NEUT9|I named my late dog after invidious and I always look forward to this and I'm glad your breaking form 'cause I mean listen.
NEUT10|You got a lot of great guests tonight, but he's probably the most.
NEUT11|Single most important, the largest could be the largest semiconductor company world.
NEUT12|He did say Dave and the reason I turned to you is he's quite used.
NEUT13|The word confident that the ARM Holdings deal, which of course would put a hammerlock when so much.
NEUT14|But also they think is going to happen.
NEUT15|They're going through.
NEUT16|I know I'd be very curious to hear their thinking on that, given.
NEUT17|I mean, maybe they know something out of the UK that we don't.
BULL18|Maybe they understand they certainly understand the Chinese approval process given it took them awhile but did get Mellanox done and that was very valuable for the gym.
NEUT19|I mean you've brought it up many times.
BEAR20|We're no stranger to the idea that it's going to be very difficult to get the ARM Holdings transaction approved.
NEUT21|Well, it's game set match.
NEUT22|If they get the ARM Holdings and Jensen will typically if something's game set match.
NEUT23|That's the reason for any trust antitrust regulators to say no.
NEUT24|There are people against Bitcoin.
NEUT25|I've tell you that they actually a lot of people are confused when the reasons down as people are trying to figure out, are they getting hurt by by crypto by our theory, and they don't know how much goes through this nonsense.
BULL26|This stock should be up very big.
NEUT27|This stock has this situation almost every time.
NEUT28|Where this?
NEUT29|In 2018 it had the same crypto thing, but stock goes down and then people say wow, there must be something with the quarter and then they go back and they listen to Colette Kress, who's an amazing CFO.
NEUT30|They listen to Jensen Wong and they realize that the data center it is.
NEUT31|There's OK, the data center.
NEUT32|They have chips that can learn.
NEUT33|They had the machine learning chips that are artificial intelligence that are so needed and gaming.
NEUT34|Carl, you can't use their.
NEUT35|You can't game without their chips, 'cause it's life.
NEUT36|Like I defy people to figure out whether it's an actor or whether it's an actual design and remember Jensen.
NEUT37|At Heart is a painter.
NEUT38|He's a painter.
NEUT39|He's an architect.
NEUT40|He he is a sculpt.
NEUT41|He's I think he invented the first helicopter.
NEUT42|Remember that in the Davinci Museum, David, alright.
NEUT43|Maybe he's invented the electric helicopter.
NEUT44|Especially else invented that he's got his back.
NEUT45|Now he doesn't have his back.
NEUT46|Thankfully, he doesn't.
NEUT47|Everybody else does us three and him.
NEUT48|The only four don't have specs.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
