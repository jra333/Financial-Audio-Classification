BEAR0|"""Unity just missed their earnings and it dropped down almost 10%."
NEUT1|Stick around and we'll talk about what we think.

NEUT6|So back to the topic of unity.
BEAR7|When we look at the price action today, we see that it broke down the long term trend line.
BEAR8|It also lost its support.
NEUT9|This tells us of a potential risk.
BEAR10|It's a sign of weakness and it tells us we need to be careful as there's potential for more downside before it can start going back up.
NEUT11|However, this alone does not tell us everything, though.
NEUT12|Also, there's not much historical data to work with.
NEUT13|This company went public September of 2020, which is just a few months ago.
NEUT14|So we want to look at several things from several angles and figure out what type of trade we can do with this.
NEUT15|First one to the other indicators tell us.
BULL16|They are all quite weak, which is indicative of a possible buying opportunity, but it hasn't given a clear signal that things will turn around for the better.
NEUT17|When it comes to indicators.
NEUT18|We want to see things like crossovers coming out of the week zones.
NEUT19|This is because while buying on weakness is true.
NEUT20|We also don't want to be caught on the wrong direction.
NEUT21|As it's headed down further that's why we look for crossovers assign that it will change direction.
BULL22|We see that today's candle is a strong solid green, which means there are more buyers jumping in.
BULL23|Today we want to see that this level could hold in the next coming days, which would help improve the indicator, signaling that things will get better in price will go back up the hourly in 15 minute chart shows us that there's strength forming lots of buyers coming in today, which hopefully builds a new support level.
NEUT24|Again, there's not much information in the chart to be able to tell where these levels were being that it's only been trading for a few months.
BULL25|But the hourly in 15 minute charts look promising for short term.
BULL26|A trader would see this as a good entry point to profit from a quick flip.
NEUT27|Using stop loss orders around $130 would come in handy to protect yourself while taking a chance to write it back up.
NEUT28|If you're someone like myself who feels Unity has a lot of future potential and looking to invest in unity for a long term, hold a day like today would be when you want to make your first small purchase.
NEUT29|Emphasis would be on the two words first and small.
NEUT30|I personally like to build up to a full position by buying them in stages in several parts and never all in or too big.
NEUT31|This is minimized chances of making a mistake and not letting that one mistake get to you.
BEAR32|If it does drop a little more.
NEUT33|This allows you to buy a little more next time around.
NEUT34|Well, that's all for today.
