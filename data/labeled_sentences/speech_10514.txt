NEUT0|"""Facebook is stepping up its criticism of apples ad tracking an privacy, changes its running newspaper ads to do that."
BULL1|These social networks saying it is quote standing up to Apple for small businesses everywhere.
BEAR2|Claiming that Apple's changes will be devastating to them, an limit businesses ability to run personalized ads and to reach their customers.
NEUT3|Affectively, Apple striking back in defense of its changes, saying quote, it's a simple matter of standing up.
NEUT4|For our users Jim this is gone to a new level.
NEUT5|It would seem of hostility in some way.
NEUT6|Interesting Facebook's choice here to sort of focus on small business and how they're going to be disadvantaged by this change, which is just simply going to make it much, much easier for people to realize what they're giving up an opt out in a way that they weren't previously.
NEUT7|You know you had to actually dig into your settings and do things that you might not have in terms of disabling certain parts of the Facebook app.
NEUT8|This is a classic debate.
NEUT9|One thing that we know Tim Cook is adamant about the CEO of Apple is the user and the user's satisfaction that companies about customer satisfaction.
NEUT10|It's not about helping a business.
BULL11|It's although businesses have benefited mightily.
BULL12|Millions of other people have benefited from writing apps.
NEUT13|Facebook has become a great defender of small business because small businesses do make a lot of money.
BULL14|Advertising it's been a winning way to go on to Instagram.
NEUT15|I don't know whether it's necessarily the right way to go on Apple, but Apple has to defend the consumer, so I mean it's it's a clash.
NEUT16|David, I can't say that either side is right or wrong, but I'm an Apple user and as far as I'm concerned, all that I've ever seen is our evidence of things that make my life easier.
NEUT17|They do not necessarily make it so that I can buy small business goods easier, and I like that I want ease of use and I want to know where things are coming from.
NEUT18|Deva.
NEUT19|I have no problem with that.
BULL20|I think it's great to Facebook standing up for small biz, but as as an Apple user.
NEUT21|I think the cook standing up for the user and that is the real beneficiar.
NEUT22|You know, I wondered him.
NEUT23|It feels like we've talked through the years about challenges to Facebook and so many different ways.
NEUT24|Remember the boycott from some of the large advertisers that was going on for some period of time?
NEUT25|Didn't seem to impact the business.
BEAR26|The as we said, the FTC is suing them saying their business practices or anticompetitive, potentially wanting them to at some point to split the company up years away if they ever get to a court will see what actually happens.
NEUT27|And now this and in the face of it all, what happens to Facebook stock Jim?
BULL28|Oh, it's good stuff just keeps moving up and one of the reasons why it's moving up is that it's got great advertising and not just from small medium, but also now from consumer packaging.
NEUT29|But David.
NEUT30|Let's face it.
NEUT31|I mean Twitter, look at Twitter moving up that Pinterest Snap.
NEUT32|I mean, this is where the advertising is going.
NEUT33|So people are buying the stocks.
NEUT34|There's a bunch of notes this morning about how advertising is going to be up next year.
NEUT35|Facebooks participating in that, and I just think that in the end, Facebook knows that small, medium sized business.
NEUT36|Are yes to use Larry Kudlow's term former or still the chief advisor, lifeblood, Lifeblood of America.
NEUT37|And if you think that, then you know that they're taking the side.
NEUT38|And David Washington does not go against companies that embrace small, medium sized business because that's Holy Grail.
NEUT39|David, you know that.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
