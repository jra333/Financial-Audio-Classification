BEAR0|"""What's up guys is still in here."
BEAR1|I'm doing a technical analysis on the stock FRS X and I think this is a very undervalued company that obviously got hit extremely hard by the EV slash tech sell off and you know everything sold off the market but.
NEUT2|That's been hit specifically harder just because it had the most momentum before the crash happened, so it goes down the hardest with the market right?
BULL3|But who knows, maybe it'll come right back up harder with the market.
BEAR4|That's what I believe, but if you look at this resistance, this is a very nasty resistance here.
NEUT5|It has been tested multiple times.
NEUT6|Take a sledgehammer smashing an award, or eventually it's gonna break just like resistances and supports an.
NEUT7|This is being tested a break on this would be a violent movement because.
NEUT8|We've also been under the 15 day 15 day MA for.
NEUT9|Quite awhile so that break of resistance would put us above the 15 ma which would be support and then we quickly be testing the 150 eight 150 day Ma, sorry.
BULL10|And those are two really great things, so we're also balancing on a support right now that is very crucial.
NEUT11|Looks super bullish.
BULL12|Super Super bullish on the daily chart.
BULL13|Arasai undersold I like it, I like it.
NEUT14|And then you go to the weekly.
NEUT15|As a Cup and handle, I mean it's forming to me.
NEUT16|I wouldn't say it's official yet, but look at that look at that company and let's.
NEUT17|That's filthy, that is something to watch.
BEAR18|And I could see the car panel breaking from this run up.
BULL19|I mean, this looks really good to me.
NEUT20|I'd have it at least on your radar.
NEUT21|Look at this.
NEUT22|Yeah, that's that's all I gotta say about Fr.
BEAR23|SX bullish.
BULL24|Thanks for watching.
NEUT25|"Like and subscribe thanks."""
