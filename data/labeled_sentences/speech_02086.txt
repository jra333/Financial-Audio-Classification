NEUT0|"""Alright, so James, I've got a topo Chico bottle in my hand."
NEUT1|I think that that this is more symbolic, making a move into having spiked topo Chico is the kind of thing that coat that says that James Quincy is breaking with tradition and changing and shaking up the company.
NEUT2|Do you think that's too harsh?
NEUT3|I I made maybe, maybe not.
NEUT4|I think what it does say is look we're gonna follow the consumer.
NEUT5|You know in the old days people were much more regimented about the categories they stayed in.
NEUT6|And there wasn't so much blurring by consumers of mixing and matching categories.
NEUT7|And I think these innovations that we've seen, including hard seltzer, are a trend of the consumer looking for new things.
NEUT8|And if we want to be consumer centric, which we we've always tried to be, not always perfectly.
NEUT9|But we wanna be.
NEUT10|Then that's what's taking us to this opportunity, inspired, as you say, by the great success of topic she guards Topo Chico, the mineral water we bring out Topo Chico, hard seltzer, first in Mexico and Brazil later this month and then coming to the US sometime soon.
NEUT11|Alright, we went in here.
NEUT12|I know September 28th is the date.
NEUT13|When can you bring it to us as it is, you know there's a shortage of this stuff 'cause it's so loved without the without the alcohol.
NEUT14|Yeah, well, it's it's the hard sell.
BULL15|It will be a different product, but we believe will be able to be in the in in the US, in in the first half of 2021 with the hard seltzer.
NEUT16|So I think that's gonna be very excited.
BULL17|Obviously the category is very hot in the US at the moment, but we think it's gonna be an interesting addition.
NEUT18|I mean obviously the Topo Chico brand has tremendous relevance and resonance with millennial consumers with people who you know who go out to bars.
BULL19|And so I think this is going to be a great opportunity for us.
NEUT20|It's very synergistic for the Coke system globally, so we're going to experiment with a number of cities around the world.
NEUT21|Just one of the many things we're doing to really focus our portfolio to be very consumer centric and drive for those brands that can create scale for us.
