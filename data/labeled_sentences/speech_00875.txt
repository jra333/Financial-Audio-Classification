NEUT0|"""Today's video we're going to look at Coca Cola and is it share price under or over value?"
NEUT1|Starting with dividends.
BEAR2|Once being lower than the top 25% of dividend payers in the US market, Coca-Cola is known to be a dividend aristocrat.
NEUT3|To be part of this dividend aristocrat group.
BULL4|A company must have increased its dividends for 25 consecutive years.
BULL5|As for Coca-Cola, the company has been raising its dividend payout since 1963, and the current dividend yield stands at 3.23%.
BULL6|Financial health Coca Cola has significantly increased its debt, which stood at just over $50 billion.
BULL7|Now whilst that is normal for a company, this may be a little higher than would be expected and is definitely something to keep your eye on in the future, but for the foreseeable future it looks like the company can handle its debt quite easily with its ability to produce free cash flow that equals 68% of its earnings before interest and tax.
BULL8|This means that it is able to reduce its debt when it wants.
NEUT9|Future growth.
NEUT10|Like a lot of dividend paying companies, growth can be very gradual.
NEUT11|Unlike non paying dividend companies.
BEAR12|Coca-cola's forecasted annual earnings is 5.7%, which is below both the industry and market forecast of 10.4 and 22.6%, but it is still higher than the savings rate.
NEUT13|Valuation.
NEUT14|So is the share price of Coca Cola affair price while the current price stands at $50.00 an 81 cent.
NEUT15|Which means it is considered overvalued.
NEUT16|However, don't panic if you are wanting to buy some shares in the company as it's only overvalued by nought point nought.
NEUT17|7% with its fair value, price being set at $50.77.
NEUT18|In conclusion, I would personally continue to buy shares at the current price rate, whilst being comfortable with a slightly higher than normal debt at the moment.
NEUT19|But let me know what you think.
NEUT20|Do you think it's a time to buy Coca Cola shares or does the debt level make it a risk?
