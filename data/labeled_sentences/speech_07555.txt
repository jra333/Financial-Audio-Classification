NEUT0|"""Let's go on to the next company, but this one is a rare company you've never heard of them."
NEUT1|It's called Apple L. Well, here we go, market cap of two point 1 gajillion.
NEUT2|And what is the PE ratio now?
NEUT3|It's expensive, it's 38 and this does matter with Apple 'cause they've always been making a lot of money, so it's not.
NEUT4|I don't look at this thing to myself.
BEAR5|Well, maybe they had a big write off.
NEUT6|No?
NEUT7|This is Apple.
NEUT8|They make a ton of money.
BULL9|Profit margin for Apple, 19.6% Checkmark Pillar #3 is revenue growth over the past five years.
NEUT10|I'm guessing it's always awesome two 15232.
BEAR11|65 a drop here.
BEAR12|275 Massive check profit growth is pulled #445.7 to.
NEUT13|57 Check mark their kids do number of shares outstanding shares outstanding Pillar #5 so guys.
NEUT14|My guess is Apple is going to use a lot of their free cash flow to buy a lot of buy.
NEUT15|A lot of shares back instead of paying a dividend own.
NEUT16|By the way 'cause that's it is a better way.
NEUT17|It's a more tax effective way for Apple to give money back to their investors.
NEUT18|It's a check mark here on shares outstanding school current assets greater than current liabilities, which is pillar number 6.0 My Lord one $44 billion.
BEAR19|In cash in 105 and current liabilities, that's $40 billion less, or $40 billion.
NEUT20|More current assets and current liabilities assets.
NEUT21|A check mark there massive check mark.
BULL22|Free cash flow growth pull over the past five years right peanut you're ready.
NEUT23|So 54 fifty 260-459-7273 point 73 at the check mark there.
NEUT24|What's the average 60 times?
NEUT25|Let's keep in 20.
NEUT26|If it's 21.2 trillion, it's currently at 2.1 trillion.
BEAR27|Is a drop by 4540% call.
NEUT28|It's actually 45% in the stocks currently at 1:35, so we need to stock it.
NEUT29|But what?
NEUT30|80 bucks?
NEUT31|I'm a buyer of the stock around 8 hours or that's what I think the value is for the company.
NEUT32|But $8.00 a share?
NEUT33|You look at minimum.
NEUT34|Yeah, where did crossover baby so across back at the end of 2019 at around $60.00 a share.
NEUT35|If you bought them by double your money right now well over double your money right now so it works in and sometimes it doesn't work.
NEUT36|'cause look right here, if you sold right here when it went below you sold at 50 and then you bump back up at 60.
NEUT37|So you've been waiting here.
NEUT38|And then yeah, so it still depends.
NEUT39|I mean going back further, you need more money.
NEUT40|But Apple is also been on include complete a prize.
NEUT41|I don't like using Apple.
NEUT42|"Very rarely do companies do this kind of growth."""
