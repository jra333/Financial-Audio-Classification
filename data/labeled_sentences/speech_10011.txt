NEUT0|"""What is going on?"
NEUT1|Everyone?
NEUT2|It's Austin with moon trades and if you are new tuning into my YouTube channel I do a lot of good videos about the stock market.
NEUT3|A lot of good lessons to be learned with zero fluff and I don't make a 30 minute video.
NEUT4|It's a video is 5 minutes long.
NEUT5|Then it's 5 minutes of information, but I'm going to jump right into this one really quick SP.
NEUT6|Why look what it did?
NEUT7|And I will actually play the clip of yesterday on what happened, right?
BULL8|So SP Y pushed up and broke out of the downturn pattern and we called it out yesterday.
NEUT9|In the clip you're seeing right now on the screen, you can go watch the video.
BEAR10|It was going sideways into lower loads.
NEUT11|Wasn't going as low.
BULL12|It didn't want to break lower so and it recovered 100%.
NEUT13|So we we called that.
BEAR14|That could have been the bottom.
NEUT15|Now this is great because the video even kind of showed what would happen now.
BEAR16|It didn't exactly go as low as I planned, but it did go pretty low.
BEAR17|They hit two 8442 for not mistaken R2D284 solid overnight and then pushed up immediately out of that descending trend.
NEUT18|And don't make this, you know, don't let yourself get forward where you're like.
NEUT19|Oh, I want to invest because it just broke out of its downtrend.
BEAR20|It's going up, no, there's downtrend consolidation trend in an uptrend, so most likely it's going to come back down and then start bouncing back up and then whether or not break size from there.
NEUT21|That would be where we're looking to take a position.
NEUT22|But don't jump in a position thinking it's just going to pull back and.
NEUT23|You know, turn around right here and then start going up, which it can, but it most likely will not do that.
NEUT24|So I just wanted to go over SP Y and show you guys.
BULL25|Yesterday's call out was perfect and I'm glad that a lot of you tuned in and love that video.
NEUT26|We got tons of using that video.
