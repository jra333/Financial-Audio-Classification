NEUT0|"""And one more you look at Jimmy."
BEAR1|Look at GameStop and I did have that large drop from $194.00 here $194.88 down to 155 and then currently at 159.
BEAR2|You're seeing that drop significantly today down to 16%.
BEAR3|That's crazy, down $31.
NEUT4|Absolutely crazy movement and just know that we've seen this same movement from AMC, you know on Thursday.
NEUT5|So if we're looking at the same movement, GME didn't really get hit by this.
BEAR6|So now they're getting hit by this.
NEUT7|It doesn't mean that they're not going to come back from it, because we do believe in what AMC is doing.
NEUT8|An GME is basically following the same thing, and Jimmy was kind of the first one to really squeeze with the first one to really increase a rapid amount, but.
NEUT9|You know, as you look at this, you can see that it does have potential, so don't give up on it.
NEUT10|I'm not giving up on it.
NEUT11|I'm still holding my shares and we can go from there.
BULL12|"So let's let's cross our fingers and hope we have a good day."""
