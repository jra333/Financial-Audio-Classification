NEUT0|"""Remember, we spoke to CEO Steve Angel in mid August."
BULL1|He explained that Hydran could be Lindy's next great growth engine, but he still about 20-30 if just 1% of the heavy long haul trucking moved to hydrogen powered vehicles, that would create a $20 billion annual market for hydrogen.
NEUT2|Now, nearly all of what Lindy produces right now is dirty hydrogen from fossil fuels.
NEUT3|But if they use natural gas as a feedstock, you get a fuel.
NEUT4|It's still 50% cleaner than gasoline or diesel, but this is just one part of an extremely consistent business.
NEUT5|The thing is.
NEUT6|Hydrogen would have to get very big before I can move the needle, as Lindy's $126 billion company stuff that mover night.
BULL7|He told us that though it's governments around the world getting more aggressive about fighting climate change, I'm pretty confident going to happen eventually.
NEUT8|But if you want a pureplay, though, well, we discover one you know.
NEUT9|So this ones moved a lot, but it's one I'm going to give you my blessing, and that is plug power.
NEUT10|If you haven't bought it already.
NEUT11|If you had them on and we were kind of shocked because they made an acquisition that made it seem like, well, wait a second, this is no longer taking a flyer.
NEUT12|This is a company that's been plugging away at fuel cells for more than 20 years.
BULL13|It's going up and Abbott finally after many false starts there on the right track at the moment.
BULL14|Plug power makes fuel cell technology for a more efficient type of forklift that can be charged more faster than older models.
NEUT15|Longer term, the company wants to fuel cell system, replace old fashioned lead acid batteries in both forklifts, industrial trucks unfortunately plug powers are red hot stock right now.
NEUT16|A year ago the stock was at $2.66.
NEUT17|Now it's $18.43.
NEUT18|That's expensive.
NEUT19|That's why I would like to pull back.
NEUT20|At Plug Power though, is that it is the future, I accept that.
