NEUT0|"""Beloved Starbucks, the intrinsic value of Starbucks is range between $1.66 per share and $33.54 per share."
NEUT1|Now how are those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $1.66 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $1.66 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $33.54 per share represents the company's earnings.
NEUT4|A price of $33.54 per share represents the fractional payment for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT5|A conservative way to value the company using future earnings and it's different from the PE ratio.
NEUT6|So what Starbucks trading at now?
NEUT7|Starbucks stock is trading at a price of $88.17 per share, and that's really big and take a look at this PE ratio here.
NEUT8|So 112 really huge Benjamin Graham suggests to stop searching.
NEUT9|Once you see 20 plus we need to move on to the next stock so as much as we love Starbucks and Starbucks coffee and even their beautiful logo, I can't tell if that's a mermaid.
NEUT10|I know there's some lower behind that we won't get into that in this video, so we'll take a look at this high end intrinsic value.
NEUT11|Right here and will wait for this share price to drop at or below this value before we proceed with some deeper fundamental analysis.
NEUT12|Now until then, where do you park your money?
NEUT13|Right here, Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT14|Now I don't have a relationship with them financially.
NEUT15|They're not paying me to say this.
NEUT16|Only reason I'm choosing them is because Warren Buffett shows them in 2008.
NEUT17|He want to bet against the hedge fund industry in 2018, where he said, hey, I can make a higher return than you can, and these are the professionals doing this, and all he did was purchase Vanguard 500 index funds and he just let it sit just like the defensive investor described in Benjamin Graham's literature, so.
NEUT18|We would do this until Starbucks has a more attractive price.
