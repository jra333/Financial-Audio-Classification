BULL0|"""Hey guys, how you doing so?"
NEUT1|This is another SEC versus XRP slash Ripple update again.
NEUT2|I'm going to be some eyes in legal briefs, videos and check him out on YouTube.
NEUT3|I'm going to add in a bit my own theory in there too.
NEUT4|So as we all know, yesterday was another discovery date in the SEC vested Ripple lawsuit.
NEUT5|To summarize the proceedings.
NEUT6|Basically what happened was Ripple had sent an ocean to ask the SEC for certain documents specifically on Bitcoin and Therium.
NEUT7|Just to basically see what internal conversations were about Bitcoin athyrium.
NEUT8|And then from that make determination to how XRP is a security or isn't the security essentially, and the SEC were trying to stop Ripple from getting these documents.
NEUT9|But yesterday Judge Netburn basically granted Ripple the access to every document they wanted, so River looking for any documents to compare XRP, Bitcoin, Ethereum and if they find them.
BEAR10|Essentially that could be case over.
NEUT11|So Jeremy Hogan says so.
NEUT12|"Keep your eyes peeled for a settlement within 30 days."""
