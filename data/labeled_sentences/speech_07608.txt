BEAR0|"""Given the unprecedented time of the economy and the debt level, could there be any risks and consequences of the US government defaulting on its bonds?"
NEUT1|No.
NEUT2|The.
NEUT3|If you.
NEUT4|If you print.
NEUT5|Bonds in your own currency.
NEUT6|What happens to the currency is.
NEUT7|Can be a question, but you don't default and.
NEUT8|The United States.
BULL9|Has been smart enough.
NEUT10|Then the people love trusted us enough.
NEUT11|To issue its debt and are its own currency and.
BEAR12|Argentina is now having a problem because the debt isn't in there.
BEAR13|Their own currency and in lots of countries have had that problem and lots of companies countries will have that problem in the future.
NEUT14|It is very painful to hold money in somebody elses currency, but.
NEUT15|If you.
NEUT16|Listen, if I could issue a currency Buffett Bucks and I had a printing press.
NEUT17|Adam, I could borrow money and I could borrow money and that I would never default.
NEUT18|So.
NEUT19|What you end up getting in terms of purchasing power can be in doubt, but in terms of the US government, I when Standard and Poor's downgraded, the United States government.
NEUT20|I think it was standard poors.
NEUT21|Years back that.
NEUT22|To me did not make sense.
NEUT23|I'm in the end in the end.
NEUT24|How you can regard?
NEUT25|Any Corporation as stronger than the.
NEUT26|A person who can print the money to pay you just don't understand.
NEUT27|So don't worry about the government defaulting.
NEUT28|I think it's kind of crazy.
NEUT29|Incidentally, this should be said.
NEUT30|To have these.
NEUT31|Limits on the debt and all of that sort of thing and then stopped government arguing about whether it's going to increase the limit.
BULL32|We're going to increase the limits on the debt that that isn't going to be paid.
NEUT33|It's going to be refunded.
NEUT34|And anybody that thinks they're going to bring down the national debt.
NEUT35|I mean that that you know there's been brief periods and.
BEAR36|I think it's the late 90s or thereabouts, one that's come down a little bit.
NEUT37|The country is going to print more debt is going to initiate.
NEUT38|The country is going to grow in terms of its its debt, paying capacity, and but the trick is to keep borrowing in your own currency.
