NEUT0|"""Hey there, this is Jeff Reeves on the editorinvestorplace.com."
NEUT1|I'm talking again with John Devine, one of our assistant editors there, John.
BULL2|Hey Jeff, how you doing good?
NEUT3|So let's talk Facebook.
NEUT4|I like Facebook.
NEUT5|I mean I don't actually like the product.
NEUT6|I'm not.
NEUT7|I'm not on Facebook because I don't want any ex girlfriends to stop me.
NEUT8|But I like to ****.
NEUT9|Thing you like Facebook to Sakai like Facebook this talk tell me why, what's what's your bullish case for this company?
NEUT10|OK so actually I'm going to start with Instagram.
NEUT11|Which Facebook owns and they bought in 2012 for a billion dollars.
BULL12|Sounds like a pretty tidy sum, but you know, in three years they've increased their user base by 10X.
NEUT13|So now there are 300,000,000.
NEUT14|They were at 27 million and they're just starting to monetize that by opening up to advertisers a little bit more.
NEUT15|They're also doing a lot with Facebook video.
NEUT16|You know they're taking on YouTube.
NEUT17|Famously, they're up to four billion streams a day, allegedly of YouTube.
NEUT18|Or excuse me Facebook videos so they're opening that up and to advertisers.
BULL19|And you know, I think it's it's going to be good for them in the long term.
NEUT20|Yeah, it's it's funny that you meant you mentioned Google in there.
NEUT21|I mean, Google bought YouTube for about a billion dollars.
NEUT22|I think in 2005, and at that time there wasn't any real money being made, but.
NEUT23|You know, it's all about figuring out where things are going to go, and Instagram certainly kind of has that momentum behind it.
NEUT24|You kind of feel like Facebook is doing the Google thing where they're seeing the future of advertising with these products.
NEUT25|Yeah, well, I think that they've they've got a huge user base of a, you know a billion plus people.
NEUT26|And like you said earlier when we were talking about what they can offer advertisers is that it can get very specific and segmented and they have a lot of information that you know we just volunteer up.
NEUT27|You know such as all your ex girlfriends.
NEUT28|You know nobody read the terms of service, we just click the box exactly so they can get pretty targeted.
NEUT29|And I mean nobody else can do it like them so.
NEUT30|But also just want to touch on one more bullish point and that's aculus, which is their virtual reality platform.
NEUT31|I don't think it's going to be, you know, a short term mover for them, but over the long term, you know Zuck is getting pretty pretty ambitious.
NEUT32|He's talking about doing things like doctors, consultations, you know, over virtual reality, creepy creepy, a little creepy courtside seats to NBA games.
NEUT33|You know, you know.
NEUT34|Even taking courses virtually so but in in in the short term, it's just going to be basically being on Xbox, so anything else we should look for before we wrap up here.
NEUT35|What else is faced?
NEUT36|Facebook I going?
NEUT37|Well, it's got a buy button and all their testing it at least.
BULL38|So I think that could be a big catalyst in the future when they got a lot of reasons to like Facebook stock is doing well.
NEUT39|Many of you use it regularly, even if you're not afraid of ex girlfriends like me.
BULL40|Thanks for talking, John.
BULL41|"Thank you."""
