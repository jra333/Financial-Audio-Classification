NEUT0|"""Or so how has the Bloomberg candidacy affected your campaign?"
NEUT1|Well, Chris, I think he's a completely different person than me.
NEUT2|I mean, one of the things I've said from the beginning is I suggested a wealth tax over a year ago, and I said that if anybody wants to lead the Democratic Party who's this successful and rich is Mike Bloomberg or me that that person has to embrace the brace a wealth tax as a symbol of the of wanting to undo the inequity in income and money in our society?
NEUT3|And obviously that's something where he hasn't gone along.
NEUT4|I mean, we have very very different messages.
NEUT5|In terms of what we stand for it for Democratic primary voters, do you agree that you'll get lumped in an even by the folks you're running against into this?
NEUT6|Just sort of billionaires who want to buy their way into the debates.
NEUT7|Billionaires who want to buy their way into the presidency.
NEUT8|Well, Mike Bloomberg isn't even trying to get into the debate, so I'm not worrying about that.
NEUT9|Look.
NEUT10|The way I see this, Chris is very simple.
NEUT11|I've spent 10 years as an outsider taking on the corporations who I think have bought our democracy, bought the government in Washington DC.
NEUT12|That's really different from everybody in the race, including Mike Bloomberg.
NEUT13|I have a long history of taking on oil companies and tobacco companies and utilities and drug companies and beating them.
NEUT14|That is a very different message and a very different history from Mike.
NEUT15|But it's a very different history from everybody else on that debate Stage 2.
