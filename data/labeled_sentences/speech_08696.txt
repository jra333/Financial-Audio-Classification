NEUT0|"""Hey it's June 3rd."
NEUT1|This is Dan Charles from Weed, Stock Pro and simpletrades.net.
NEUT2|Looking at Facebook stock on June 3rd, 2019.
NEUT3|So if you look at the low here it hit one 6101, so that's supported.
NEUT4|$161.00 and anytime you get a big drop like this big rangy candle like we had today.
BULL5|It's very likely specially after hitting support at that price that low.
BULL6|I'm expecting this to rebound tomorrow, so I'm going to be looking too.
NEUT7|Buy this up on small timeframes and make some money.
NEUT8|Alright, let's check in and see how those trades went.
NEUT9|OK, we're looking at Facebook stock a few days later.
NEUT10|And.
BULL11|I thought this was going to go up and it definitely did.
BULL12|Facebook to me looks like it's going to go higher as well, but I got out today so I entered on the 4th.
NEUT13|Somewhere around 1:00.
NEUT14|64 ish vaguely remember.
NEUT15|And I got out today at 172.
NEUT16|50 so.
BULL17|But I think it could go higher, but I was happy with.
NEUT18|My profit on this trade 'cause I just do this over and over and over and over again.
NEUT19|To several different stocks and so.
NEUT20|It's not a big deal, but you can learn how to use this scanner with these indicators.
NEUT21|Let me know if you have any questions on that, because once you learn the power of these indicators in this system.
NEUT22|You can start picking stocks.
NEUT23|And not only stocks, currencies, commodities, etc.
NEUT24|So if you have any questions on that, let me know.
BULL25|"Alright, thanks for watching."""
