NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 22nd of March 2021.
NEUT2|Monday, the 1st day after week.
NEUT3|We're in the 31 Bitcoin SV Weaver ticker BSV for BSV.
NEUT4|Against BTC.
BEAR5|Things are not looking good.
BEAR6|We have been in a downward trend.
BEAR7|We've been going down and down and down and down and down and down NBSP PSV has been very weak.
BULL8|There are no signs of strength for BSV at this point of time.
NEUT9|Maybe sometime in the future, but not at this point of time.
NEUT10|We are still.
NEUT11|Under the skinny pink line and as long as we are under the skinny pink line, we shall remain bias bearish for BSV against BTC.
BEAR12|This could be a double bullish divergance, maybe lower lower the price for the higher lower Normandy higher low on the RSI, which means that potentially BSV could be popping higher, but we don't really see any clear signs of bullishness yet.
NEUT13|And until we see signs of bullishness we will not be doing anything for BSV because if your money was in Bitcoin all along you would have done so much better, right?
NEUT14|Look at how far BSV has.
BEAR15|Fallen already down 92% against BTC.
NEUT16|Right, so yes, it is very very weak and I deal with the strength.
BULL17|We shall not be rushing into anything for BSV against BTC other than this super spike for BSV well, we have never really been in a bullish trend against BTC.
BEAR18|If anything, the trend has always remained bearish against BTC.
NEUT19|Yes, there was a pop but no other than that.
BEAR20|BSV has been very weak against BTC so be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT21|Let's move on to PSV against USD.
NEUT22|But before that please give this video a like.
NEUT23|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about BSV in the comments below.
NEUT24|For PSV against USZ like I was saying as it is many many many many times all the other coins have been popping higher right?
BEAR25|Except BSV BSV has been in a consolidation in it doesn't feel like we are popping higher everytime BSV does a spike up it gets pulled back down.
BEAR26|There is significant selling happening for PSV against USD spike up we get put down spike out we get pulled down again so potentially we could be.
NEUT27|Falling lower right to take out again.
NEUT28|I'm just going to extend it here.
NEUT29|All of the stops else over here with a move towards the downside right?
NEUT30|However, this could be a set up for a symmetrical triangle and we could be popping higher, but at the same time we could also be forming.
BEAR31|Mountain ranges in this could be a bearish move coming on for BSV against USD.
NEUT32|We're not exactly sure.
BULL33|We are still anticipating more moves towards the downside.
NEUT34|An if anything we should be popping towards 100th.
NEUT35|But in your plus minus $130, that is our expectation for PSV are very likely going to be.
BEAR36|The wheels are very likely going to be eating up all the stops.
NEUT37|Else along this point.
NEUT38|So be very, very careful about going into a trade too soon.
NEUT39|Alright, I guess I say from my BSV technical analysis.
NEUT40|Stay safe, don't do anything.
NEUT41|I wouldn't do.
BULL42|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL43|Hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT44|"I shall see you in the next video."""
