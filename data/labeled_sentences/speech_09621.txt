NEUT0|"""Alright, bar you got you got your charge pulled up there for eBay?"
NEUT1|Yeah you see it.
NEUT2|Yeah, look at that market cap what is it?
NEUT3|Look at this in March of 28 bucks.
BULL4|Now it's 50, got as high as $60.00 a share.
NEUT5|Market cap is 35 billion logos PSF.
NEUT6|Now remember their prices sales ratios.
NEUT7|3 Remember the other ones were 18 and 50 and all these big numbers.
BEAR8|So this is a seven PE very low 25% profit margin 75% gross margin.
BULL9|This is awesome, great well under 1.3%.
NEUT10|But it's something about remarks about revenue growth Pillar #3 Paul revenue growth over the past five years are all organic 8.6 billion to 10.8 and I bet you in the last year they probably did even better than that.
BULL11|Yeah wow, 20% revenue.
BULL12|That's incredible.
BULL13|They're up to 12.2 billion in the last 12 months.
BULL14|That's incredible good for them.
NEUT15|How about profit, profit growth?
NEUT16|Pillar #4?
NEUT17|One point 7251.786.
NEUT18|So barely up.
NEUT19|It is a check mark that's four straight checkmarks for eBay, Paul.
BEAR20|Yep, and number of shares outstanding dealer #5 number of shares 1.2 billion down at 8:50.
BULL21|So they're taking their free cash flow and they are buying back.
BEAR22|Shares OK. Current assets over current liabilities is Bill #6.
NEUT23|Current assets 6.7 billion current liabilities 3.84 billion check mark there nice job wow OK free cash flow growth what is their free cash flow pool?
BEAR24|Alright, it was three points 4 billion down to 2.6.
NEUT25|So and then let's do the average over the last five years you ready.
NEUT26|I'm ready, go ahead.
NEUT27|So you have three points 4.
NEUT28|We have 2.6.
NEUT29|We have two we have 2.5 and we have 2.22 point.
NEUT30|3 is the average.
NEUT31|Is that the average?
BULL32|Yeah, I think so.
NEUT33|I will say this guys.
NEUT34|This is a very slow growing company, but it is the dominant one.
NEUT35|It is the dominant one.
NEUT36|Are you surprised?
NEUT37|In 20 years Paul, there really hasn't been a competitor to eBay and I don't see one incredible.
NEUT38|You're absolutely right set.
BULL39|That is absolutely incredible.
NEUT40|Like what is the competitor to eBay?
NEUT41|Tell me one like Amazons, any computer, eBay.
NEUT42|They don't do the same thing.
NEUT43|EBay this auction marketplace thing where it's totally different, you know?
NEUT44|I mean you were talking about so we came up with the free cash flow of 2.3.
NEUT45|Their market cap is 100.
NEUT46|So what do you think about Pillar?
BULL47|#8 is priced to freaking market cap.
NEUT48|Market cap is 34.
NEUT49|Seven.
BEAR50|Oh sorry I'm on the wrong one.
BEAR51|Sorry you have 34.
BEAR52|My apologies.
NEUT53|So my personal opinion is I like eBay sub $45.00.
NEUT54|So what's 15 * 2.3?
NEUT55|That's 35.
NEUT56|Oh, it's about where it's at right now at 35.
NEUT57|Yeah, 35.
BULL58|Yeah, so I'm looking at going OK.
NEUT59|It's probably worth what it's worth right now.
NEUT60|Maybe it was $50.
NEUT61|I don't remember, but I have some eBay shares and I have a lot of puts on eBay.
NEUT62|I like eBay dominant in their market.
NEUT63|They're not going anywhere in my opinion.
BULL64|They generate decent cash flow and in the last year let's see how their cash flows been for the last year.
BEAR65|Trailing 12 months.
NEUT66|2 billion.
BEAR67|It's actually decreasing.
NEUT68|I don't like that very much shoot.
NEUT69|Why is it decreasing?
NEUT70|It's so weird.
NEUT71|It's really strange how well.
NEUT72|I still like them.
BULL73|I still like them as a. I still think they're a good stock.
BULL74|I think they're going to be worth.
NEUT75|Let me see here, let me see what I have eBay worth according my Model 55 to 85 depending on how big are small, the margin is not stuff.
BULL76|"So I do think it's a it's an upside potential here."""
