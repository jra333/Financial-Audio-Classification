BEAR0|"""Morning everybody is stuck smart here again and thanks for everybody who's recently subscribed or put 1070 Subs."
NEUT1|I'm looking to hit 2000 by the end of the year just by bringing biweekly content on the silver price and giving you some coin tips and stuff like that really.
BULL2|So I'm hoping that my broadcaster software is a bit better today.
NEUT3|Reinstalled an earlier version taupe.
BULL4|Hopefully it's a bit more stable.
BEAR5|So last time we were looking at the silver price and saying that probably be a stab down and which as you can see here there was to 14.376.
NEUT6|Something like a bit closer down bounced off, and that figure and this.
NEUT7|Here is the support line that we're currently watching at 14 point.
NEUT8|Well about 14.
BEAR9|.228 so if we reach this support line at 14.228, then it's likely to fall to about 13.
NEUT10|Then half 14 ish and so we need to watch that.
BEAR11|I suspect that there will be some more downside in the next couple of weeks.
NEUT12|I've got a personal target of 14 at the moment that I'm looking at.
NEUT13|So that's where we are with the silver price.
BEAR14|Very low at the moment.
NEUT15|If you want to purchase.
NEUT16|Silver to go with.
NEUT17|Just got in another two and a half thousand of these pandas and selling them.
NEUT18|Quiet Premium 14.81, which just shows you how popular these ponders are, so that's my top tip today and thank you to everybody who's subscribed to channel were nearly or put 100,000 views.
BULL19|It should be a nice milestone and thank you to everybody comments on the videos.
NEUT20|"Please thumbs up the video and subscribe if you've not subscribed already, and let's stack smart together that Chelsea again soon."""
