NEUT0|"""Now whenever you hear cold chain networks, think carrier the ultimate control company spun off and all of the old United Technologies David Faber interview these guys."
NEUT1|It was just a it was such a great interview that I was completely jealous.
NEUT2|Now carrier makes freezer trucks and they're all in on ensuring we have enough of them.
NEUT3|They are integral to the chain.
NEUT4|Of course, before the vaccine gets the logistics place, it will likely go through the drug distributors and listen up, because this is where the big money is gonna be made.
NEUT5|It's an oligopoly industry.
NEUT6|It's controlled by McKesson Cardinal Health, which is not been that good of stock in Mercersburg.
NEUT7|And taken together, these middle men have just, well, they've not been great investments of late and a lot of people wonder why they should even exist.
NEUT8|Why have one more cogs, the Rube Goldberg machine?
NEUT9|Is America's healthcare system, but you know what?
NEUT10|This is their time to shine.
NEUT11|We've got three companies that exist solely to distribute drugs, and we certainly need to get the covid vaccine hundreds of millions of people.
NEUT12|If you want to buy one, I say you buy McKesson.
NEUT13|That's the largest.
BULL14|It's the best run, and crucially, the only drug spirit distributor that specifically been selected to participate.
NEUT15|Operation warp speed.
NEUT16|I would buy this one right here tomorrow morning.
NEUT17|McKesson, the CDC already had a contract with cash in hand lever Action for Children program, and they were instrumental in getting the swine flu vaccine out a decade ago.
NEUT18|Plus so response.
NEUT19|But yes, it did report about quarter, just a massive top and bottom line beat.
BULL20|I really unbelievable, even better management raised their full year forecast dramatically.
BULL21|Thanks in part to the kicking and storage of ancillary supplies for future COVID-19 vaccines.
NEUT22|In other words, they're ready.
BULL23|They're up 33% for the year.
NEUT24|McKesson still sells for roughly 10 times next year's estimates.
NEUT25|That's ridiculous, I know that it's somewhat of a cutthroat business, but these guys deserve this so much higher.
NEUT26|I picked this one could have a lot of room to run.
NEUT27|I like McKesson.
NEUT28|What about the other end of supply chain?
NEUT29|We have to actually administer the vaccine somewhere.
NEUT30|Alright?
NEUT31|Well, here we go.
NEUT32|The ones that you all know, the government has agreements with CVS and Walgreens to get the vaccine to residents of long term care facilities.
BULL33|On top of that last week, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a new set of partnerships with 60% of the pharmacies that 60.
NEUT34|In the United States and that includes Kroger OK, Right here, right, Walmart reports this week tomorrow.
NEUT35|Be careful and Costco, which just gave you a $10 special dividend tonight.
NEUT36|Stocks just.
NEUT37|Show so how much could this business be worth?
NEUT38|Last week Morgan Stanley took a stab at answering this question for CVS.
NEUT39|They concluded that the vaccine distribution could be worth 2 to $0.39 of earnings per share, giving the stock trades at 10 times earnings that translate to as much as 4 bucks.
NEUT40|4 bucks per share for the stock price, and this stock has been just kind of.
BULL41|Well now it's up ten straight points.
NEUT42|I don't even know my Chapel trust owns it.
NEUT43|I mean if I can recommend it appear it's just been a straight line.
NEUT44|If you get lots of people coming from the vaccine, many of them will probably buy other things, right?
NEUT45|I mean, you don't just buy everything from Amazon.
NEUT46|The great thing everyone with pharmacy exposure gets a boost CVS should benefit the most.
