BEAR0|"""For all the talk about historic wage growth in the last year or so, most workers barely saw their paychecks budge."
NEUT1|Yahoo Finance's Sabeel Marsellus joins us now to tell us why?
NEUT2|What gives a Bell?
NEUT3|That's right Alexis.
BULL4|So we saw historic wage growth in 2020 amid the pandemic.
BULL5|That's supposed to be good news.
BEAR6|Well, it's actually an indicator of more income inequality in America.
NEUT7|Now here's what happened the highest earners.
BULL8|Did so well during the pandemic last year that they were able to gain an additional close to a million jobs.
BEAR9|But when it comes to those who are the lowest earners, they were the ones who felt the brunt of the coronavirus pandemic and face those brutal layoffs and those job cuts.
BEAR10|And we're seeing is that the average is when it comes to wages being pulled up by those highest earners.
NEUT11|But it's not reflecting the devastation the pandemic has created.
BULL12|On those who are making the least amount of money in our system Now if you look at the numbers, the median hourly wages grew, an eye popping 6.9% between 2019 and 2020.
BULL13|For comparison, it only grew 1% between 2018 and 2019.
BEAR14|That was amid low unemployment and a tight labor market.
BEAR15|But despite we're seeing that biggest single year wage growth in 45 years in 2020, it is unfortunately.
BEAR16|Indication that a lot of low wage earners in our system have been struggling over the past year and continue to struggle.
NEUT17|Alright, so Bill Marcellus.
BULL18|"Thanks so much."""
