NEUT0|"""OK look, take a look at this daily chart of the Dow Jones industrial average to market."
NEUT1|His team take a proactive approach to time in the market rather than a reactive one which doesn't do us any good at all.
BEAR2|In late August you can see he warned us that the market would could soon peak and we did have a short term peak followed by a big breakdown, but it didn't stick.
NEUT3|Why not?
NEUT4|Here's the thing many years ago to mark him up to Mark came up with a series of timing models that couldn't be ridiculously reliable.
NEUT5|He's always looking for moments.
NEUT6|True, just moments.
NEUT7|Snapshots where trend is about to exhaust itself.
NEUT8|You get more detail on this method at something called symbolic, spell FUSY MB olik.com his cloud based analytics platform.
NEUT9|These models allowed to mark and his team to spot key price levels and key moments where a stock or an index or even a cryptocurrency is likely to change its trajectory when the Dow peaked in September 2nd, you can see where we are.
NEUT10|It coincided perfectly with the marks timing model, but not his priced model.
NEUT11|He figured we run all the way to 29,400 or even 29,500 before repeat.
BEAR12|In other words, even though he pretty much cooler so off his methodology suggested there was something off about the decline when the Dow bottomed on September 24th.
BULL13|To Mark Short term timing indicator turned positive.
BULL14|Which convinced him that his old upside targets were back in play.
BEAR15|He sees the Dow running to anywhere from 24409 to 29, five, five, one before it runs out of steam up about 2 1/2 to 3% from which currently trading.
NEUT16|So we want to grab that gate right?
NEUT17|We want to grab what we don't want to.
NEUT18|We don't want to be greedy.
NEUT19|So in terms of timing, the Dallas Now 10 sessions into what could be another 13 session sequential pattern.
NEUT20|That's the same pattern that told to mark the market would roll over in early September if we get three more sessions, right?
NEUT21|Where the Dow finishes above the clothes from two days before above, the closer two days before then, the pattern says we're looking at a top.
NEUT22|So let's take a look at what could happen here.
NEUT23|Demarkes another timing model.
NEUT24|It puts us, puts us 11 sessions into a 13 session countdown, meaning two more up days.
NEUT25|Take us to the peak.
NEUT26|If the Dow also hits the Mark's price target in that.
BULL27|Well, then things could get ugly soon as pattern holds up, he thinks we've got one last leg higher.
NEUT28|OK, so you have to get out today, but you have one last leg higher before this rally runs out of Steam.
NEUT29|It's possibly at the end of the week.
NEUT30|That's not what I want to hear, but it would make sense.
NEUT31|We've had a monster run going into earnings season, so let's say this pattern unfolds.
BULL32|As predicted, we get one last hurrah through the end of the week.
NEUT33|We learned about three more big weeks of earnings after this.
NEUT34|Then the market rolls over.
NEUT35|What happens next?
NEUT36|Well, then, of course we have to contend with the election.
NEUT37|Assuming the Dow peaks in few days and then we get that sharp decline is talking about the Mark says there should be just enough time for his indicators to turn positive and identify a bottom right before the election.
