NEUT0|"""Jimmy got an update a tick tock."
NEUT1|Yeah the Chinese got to accelerate the distribution of their stock.
NEUT2|Now at the time of the Oracle Walmart investment, which is something that the president really wants, the Chinese historic have not wanted that, but it sounds like the Chinese are going to have to give in because the president wants to use win here and he'll get it if they do accelerate and therefore there will be no Chinese steak.
NEUT3|When the Walmart Oracle deal closes by Walmart, Walmart is the winner.
NEUT4|Great piece in your Yahoo finance, say by Brian Susie.
NEUT5|Explains everything I would by Walmart on this and it really is incredible.
NEUT6|The Chinese have to give it all up when they at the time of the way, how they how they going to do that well and how they want to.
NEUT7|I don't think they want to but they may have to OK. What are they going to do it through a public offering?
NEUT8|Another words?
NEUT9|How they?
NEUT10|I mean, they're not yet.
NEUT11|What does that mean?
BULL12|Yes, yeah.
NEUT13|At the time of the, you know, the idea was they were going to wait a little while with the timetable.
NEUT14|Overrated accelerated do so they would close the transaction in terms of the purchase by Oracle and Walmart of the 20% right at the same time that Bytedance would sell out in a public offering of its ownership.
NEUT15|That's what I understand.
NEUT16|That's very accelerated.
NEUT17|You know that wasn't that whole 12 month thing is going to be off the table for President gets his way?
NEUT18|And again, the winner to me is Walmart that the president really wants a competitor we know to fate to, to Facebook.
NEUT19|He'll get it.
NEUT20|I don't know.
NEUT21|I mean, she's the Chinese unit.
NEUT22|Somehow Chinese, somehow, Carl.
NEUT23|I don't think we're done with this.
BEAR24|No, we're definitely not well.
BULL25|The Chinese agree to that it's a huge win for the US versus the Chinese well, but the Global Times headline now is.
BEAR26|China won't approve current Tick tock agreement.
BEAR27|"So you guys are right, we're not done."""
