BULL0|"""Good morning traders."
NEUT1|This is a pre market analysis on GameStop today is Monday.
NEUT2|It's about 5:50 AM.
BEAR3|I saw that GameStop was running really hard in the pre market.
NEUT4|It's not in my price range to trade but I thought I would make an analysis video because that's a very interesting mover.
BULL5|Friday it went up from $42 all the way to 76 dollars, which is about 100% gain, which is huge, especially for a stock of that price.
NEUT6|And then this morning and also this yellow line.
NEUT7|Here marks the last time that the stock was at this $65 ish level.
NEUT8|Which was way back and I think 2008.
NEUT9|So we haven't seen these prices on GameStop for a very long time.
NEUT10|This morning it opened up at 4:00 AM.
BULL11|Ann just broke right through the Friday high in that first candle, so one possible entry that would have worked out really well as well.
NEUT12|After seeing this thing, make a new high, let it pull back and then the first one minute candle that makes a new high.
NEUT13|Right here you get in on.
NEUT14|You can set your stop loss below this candle and you would have easily made to our trade.
NEUT15|Or more if you if you wanted to.
NEUT16|This thing ran really hard because the range of this candle here.
NEUT17|Let's see 77 to 7860 Zero Dollars $63.20 is all you would need to get to R and let's see that would be about 81.
NEUT18|Start about 8240.
NEUT19|And you would have gotten it right here on this candle, so you could have been done trading right there.
NEUT20|Or you could have sold out partial shares an held because this thing never ever came near the stop loss and it just ran really, really hard.
BULL21|All the way up to $136.00.
BEAR22|So about another 100% move from where it opened in the pre market which is pretty crazy and now it's selling off an I don't like to make predictions, but it's pretty unlikely that it's going to go any higher than it did.
NEUT23|An will likely sell off at the open, so just whatever you do, make sure you're very careful and methodical about trading.
NEUT24|This always have a profit target Anna stop loss in mind before you get into the trade.
NEUT25|And take them no matter what.
NEUT26|You don't want to be a bag Holder.
NEUT27|I'm sure there's already quite a few that bought it above $100 and.
BULL28|That are holding right now, hoping that this thing makes a new high, but it's going to take a lot to get it back up to that $136 level.
BULL29|So anyway, I hope this video helps you.
NEUT30|Sorry I'm kind of whispering.
NEUT31|It's very early in the morning.
NEUT32|Still, there's other people in my house, so But anyway, that's GameStop and just be careful with it.
NEUT33|"That's all I can say."""
