BULL1|As you know Jim, you just said Coke scene organic revenue 5 versus the prior for James Cuisine is doing such a great job and he's doing it with a Coke 0 sugar which happens to be quite good tasting him.
NEUT2|He's doing with water he's doing with those small small formats.
NEUT3|Whimsical, he's doing it with better technology, transforming the company, getting better bang for the Buck and doing also, by the way, trying to get a little more environmental in terms of plastic, which I like.
NEUT4|This is a good story.
NEUT5|It reminds me of the old days when Coca-Cola would churn and just churn and churn and give you numbers.
NEUT6|This stock deserves to be higher and I think Quincy has really in his own very subtle way.
NEUT7|Become a great.
NEUT8|Consumer Packaged Goods CEO.
NEUT9|He does not take himself too seriously seriously.
NEUT10|And So what happens is when you're out with him, you're thinking, holy cow man, this guy's got some mojo.
NEUT11|It's emotional factor.
NEUT12|It's mojo per share.
BEAR13|If this holds, this three and a half pre market level holds would be the biggest gap higher on earnings in four years, thanks to bespoke for that you don't get these kinds of pops on Coke numbers.
NEUT14|General no.
BULL15|It you know this is some people could argue that this is the best in a decade for Coca Cola.
NEUT16|I mean, it's really.
BULL17|Pretty amazing, and it's a transformative situation.
NEUT18|I double digit growth from for zero and I think people are saying that this is the old Coca Cola.
NEUT19|Where you just have to say you know what?
NEUT20|Warren Buffett's right is that the old Coca Cola?
NEUT21|From what that from the 90s?
NEUT22|I mean, I can't even yes from the 90s.
NEUT23|What point would you want to go back to Italy if you go back?
NEUT24|Let's go back ten years?
NEUT25|Yeah, that's not the 90s, obviously, but this is in great sweater error.
NEUT26|Yeah, I like.
NEUT27|I like everything I hear and I get the new products and they've got a new energy drink.
NEUT28|I gotta tell you, I took the energy company.
NEUT29|This looks so good and what happens?
NEUT30|I'm gonna say that used to do what I used to do when I was in college.
NEUT31|Where do you go to sleep from Tuesday?
NEUT32|It always felt Tuesday.
NEUT33|Take the night off.
NEUT34|Why sleep Tuesday?
NEUT35|No, we won't allow any energy.
NEUT36|The whole idea of sleeping Tuesday night now what exactly was that illness that affected me so I didn't have to sleep?
NEUT37|Maybe will take that offline, but I do think there energy drink is better than Monster.
NEUT38|Clearly, having some you didn't you tell a Twitter user this morning he woke up at 3:20 'cause the bad guys wake up at 5. Who happens to be update the bad guys?
NEUT39|You gotta stay one step ahead of the posse.
NEUT40|If you're going to be on your game.
NEUT41|Yeah, I got up at 3:20.
NEUT42|The bad guys kind of get up there.
NEUT43|Look at the farm where I am all over then and they are de Lac.
NEUT44|"They lack the Coca Cola energy."""
