NEUT1|Volume analysis is the technique of assessing the health of a trend based on buying and selling pressure.
NEUT2|Your ability to assess what volume is telling you, in conjunction with price action, can be the deciding factor in your ability to turn a profit in the market.
NEUT3|As you can imagine, I could go on for hours about volume trading strategies.
NEUT4|However, for this video to keep things focused, we're going to deep dive into how to use volume to day trade breakouts.
BEAR5|I've decided to cover breakouts because this is arguably the toughest setup today.
NEUT6|Trade as of late.
BULL7|I have really began to gravitate towards pullback trades.
NEUT8|It just feels like the money comes my way without a fight.
NEUT9|I know that for many of you I will not be able to convince you otherwise.
BULL10|That break outs are a tough game to play, so let me give my best shot at explaining how adding volume to your analysis can increase your odds in the breakout game which has a blind success rate of less than 33%.
NEUT11|Like any technical indicator in the Market Volume will provide you with buy or sell signals on every tick, but it is up to you to decipher which signals require your attention.
NEUT12|In this trading example.
NEUT13|We are going to cover a break out of the stock.
NEUT14|Calithera Biosciences.
BULL15|The stock had a nice run up in the morning and then consolidated for two bars.
NEUT16|What made this breakout so powerful was the volume that came in on the move up on the breakout candle stick.
NEUT17|There were over 65,000 shares traded.
BULL18|65,000 shares was more than both of the prior 2 candle sticks volume combined.
BEAR19|This breakout took Calithera from $16.40 to North of $17.00.
NEUT20|$0.40 can you see how volume helped signal to you that the move was real?
NEUT21|Now for those of you that like to fade stocks, let's review how volume can help you find the right short opportunities.
NEUT22|The next example is Fossil ticker FOS L. From July 12, 2017, the stock had been going through a brutal sell off and then had a nice pop on the open.
BEAR23|Notice how volume never came in as the stock backtested support.
NEUT24|What do you think happen next?
BEAR25|You got it FOS L rolled over and dropped over 10% in one day.
NEUT26|Now that we have covered the basics, there are two additional filters you will need to keep in mind to weed out the 66% of breakouts that failed first.
NEUT27|The price action.
BULL28|Notice how in both examples mentioned in this video, the trends were strong in One Direction.
NEUT29|Next, the stocks were relatively close to the 20.
NEUT30|Moving average at the time of breakout.
NEUT31|The 20.
NEUT32|Ma is my favorite average that captures the sentiment of big players.
NEUT33|That's because it takes time for a stock to get close to its twenty.
NEUT34|Moving average after a strong move.
BULL35|This means a stock has likely had the time to consolidate or have a nice pull back.
NEUT36|The key is making sure the trending stock does not crack through the 20.
NEUT37|Moving average or breach it for more than a borrow to.
NEUT38|Now with, you have the understand the power of combining volume, price action and how a stock trades in regards to the 20.
NEUT39|Moving average.
NEUT40|Another look at the two aforementioned chart example.
NEUT41|Are you able to see the setups now?
NEUT42|If not, do not worry.
NEUT43|Keep looking at hundreds of setups until it pops out at you.
BULL44|Being able to see the breakout setups that will likely work will save you so much headache that it is worth the time investment.
