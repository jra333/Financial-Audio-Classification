NEUT0|"""Dive a little deeper if we could into this move by Apple."
BULL1|Another new high today we bring in the number one analyst Bernstein's Toni Sekona, Guy.
NEUT2|He joins us on the phone.
NEUT3|Tony.
BULL4|Welcome back.
BULL5|Thanks, Scott.
NEUT6|Big day you raise your price target.
NEUT7|You do not upgrade the stock you I promise you you better call me when you upgrade this stock.
NEUT8|Tony 'cause I mean, you gotta promise me if you do that, you're going to call me now.
NEUT9|You may never call because you may never upgrade it.
NEUT10|Based on your history here, what what's the story with the stock?
NEUT11|It keeps going up?
NEUT12|Look, it's it's a perfect storm.
BULL13|I think positive storm for the stock of forces at work here.
NEUT14|So one the stock is anticipo Tori of new product announcements.
BEAR15|Historically, in the three months prior to new iPhone announcements, the stock has outperformed.
BULL16|Not gone up outperformed the market by over 1000 basis points or 10% during that three month period over a six month period.
BULL17|It's closer to 15%, so there's some anticipation about that.
NEUT18|Second, the data points that are.
BULL19|Coming out of the supply chain are generally positive.
BULL20|the new iPhone SE is selling reasonably well.
BULL21|iPhone units appear to be stabilizing and improving, and you know the data that we get an application downloads for.
BULL22|The App Store is also good and so the prevailing business sentiment around Apple is also good.
NEUT23|And then you have this sort of comparison versus the market.
NEUT24|There's a tremendous uncertainty about what.
NEUT25|Earnings are going to be next year.
NEUT26|You know our strategists think that the market is trading at 25 * 21 earnings.
BEAR27|'cause 21 earnings are still going to be relatively depressed.
BEAR28|So Apple is trading at 22 times earnings for a company with a stalwart balance sheet that's buying back 5% of its shares whose earnings are going to be flat this year.
BEAR29|In, you know, arguably the toughest economic climate in at least a generation.
NEUT30|"And so collectively, all those things are, you know, are giving people reasons to continue to own or even add to positions in Apple."""
