NEUT0|"""I love your list and I just want to go through what I'm guessing is one of your favourites and that is it's going to be a big year for."
NEUT1|I don't know a stairstep function of the chip.
NEUT2|You know how much I love laptops?
NEUT3|I do think, well, let's let's set this straight.
NEUT4|2020 was the year of the laptop.
BULL5|It was a huge year.
NEUT6|We relied on them much more for work for school.
NEUT7|And then Apple had this giant announcement at the end of the year where they improve the MacBook Air.
BULL8|They improve the MacBook Pro with their own chips and so 2021 is going to be catch up for all the big PC manufacturers and for the chip makers.
NEUT9|I spoke with the President of Qualcomm a couple of weeks ago and he said that they are working with all the major PC makers and.
NEUT10|They expect much more to happen in this space, including five G and laptops, which you guys know is my other favorite topic.
NEUT11|Alright, so it's more than an Apple story, right?
NEUT12|It's it's, and it's more than an Apple Echo story.
NEUT13|Definitely definitely because the system the move away from Intel has been actually happening.
NEUT14|It's been happening in our mobile phones for years, right?
NEUT15|We're all used to using phones with lower power chips.
NEUT16|Those chips are just going to be like basically everything we use and I don't think it's also crazy to expect more companies themselves.
NEUT17|Moreover, the big tech Giants to get into making their own chips.
BEAR18|We're hearing rumors that Microsoft might be doing that.
NEUT19|Amazon already does some of that with their server side chips.
NEUT20|I think it's I think it's just not crazy to think about.
NEUT21|All the big tech players making their own chips.
NEUT22|Doing, I want to hear about some more of your consumer tech predictions, particularly around health.
NEUT23|Tell me what you're expecting in terms of home fitness and then also remote health care.
NEUT24|Yeah, I mean I think we have to look at everything at in 2021 through the lens of 2020 and what we all.
NEUT25|I mean it was.
NEUT26|It was a giant transformation digitally of Society of what we do and I think a lot of that continues to stick around.
NEUT27|So even if gyms open again which they they will, or an many have many of us have gotten comfortable in working out in our own in our own homes and using this connected equipment.
BULL28|So again, I think it's going to be a huge year for seeing some of this connected equipment.
NEUT29|Also, I don't think it's crazy to think about the big tech Giants getting into that space.
NEUT30|Apple's already dipped its toe in the water with this Apple Fitness plus connected to the watch.
BULL31|I think Amazon will get more into this space they create.
NEUT32|They've just released their first fitness band, so I I think you know this idea of not only the the fitness trackers and smartwatches, but also the connected equipment, the treadmills, the bikes, the the rowing machines.
NEUT33|Join at your your gutsiest call in my opinion is that this will be a big year 2021 for augmented reality because I mean Pok√©mon Go was so long ago Apple's been trying to get us to bite on this for a long time.
NEUT34|Facebook kind of has to what's going to make 21 different for that.
NEUT35|I will say I'm not being.
NEUT36|I will say I think it's going to be a year we hear a lot about it.
NEUT37|I still think like we're looking at 2022-2023 for actual connected headsets that are the crazy future things we're talking about.
NEUT38|That said, this year Facebook has said they're going to release a pair of connected to connected glasses that they there's a couple of different reports out there, but that they they are going to be made by Ray Ban or they're partnering with Ray Ban that they will have cameras in it.
NEUT39|They will have some sort of microphones in it.
NEUT40|Unclear yet if you'll actually be able to sort of.
NEUT41|See projected things in the in the area, but certainly this is going to be a big year where people are stepping towards that bigger connected headset and we're all wearing glasses.
NEUT42|That spy on us all the time, really.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
