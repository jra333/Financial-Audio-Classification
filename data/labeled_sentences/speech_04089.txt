NEUT0|"""OK, so now let's get into the actual price protection, so our grants or great move all the way from about $0.50 to one point, $7.00."
NEUT1|So not even a four times actually.
NEUT2|And then it fell back to a dollar kind of tested that line.
NEUT3|How did it?
NEUT4|And now it looks to be moving on the up again now Al Grand hasn't actually seen the ridiculous growth that a lot of other cryptocurrencies have, which is surprising considering how active the founders, how great the technology is and how much they're actually doing in the nifty space and more.
NEUT5|So you know, as this bull market stretches out, you know people start to research more and more, and I think it's only a matter of time before a lot of you know big Youtubers start talking about Al Grand and it starts getting a lot more publicity IK, specially with the you know the founder was on the links Friedman podcast every day.
NEUT6|You know he's very active, just like vital eggs so.
NEUT7|Yeah, a lot of reasons to like this crypto now I'm liking it to hit $2.00.
NEUT8|I think.
NEUT9|I think we've only just seeing the beginning of this.
BULL10|I truly believe our brand has a lot more growth this cycle.
NEUT11|Now the Max supplies like 2 billion.
NEUT12|So it is a slower moving one.
NEUT13|It does take a lot more pricing, you know, buying to actually push the price up, but I think when I checked on coin base every day it was like 70 something percent buying our grand.
NEUT14|So it's definitely popular at the moment and heating up as I'd like to say now something else.
NEUT15|It's also worth mentioning.
NEUT16|Take caution with this and only put in money that you can afford to lose as yeah, I do believe our grand will hit $2.00 but.
BEAR17|You know the whole crypto market as a whole could actually tank this time on Bitcoin because last time obviously I talked about in my helium video which will pop cut up.
NEUT18|For now.
NEUT19|I talked about how after Bitcoin kinda started seeing those huge moves down, money started to surge into heaps of Queens like Ripple and Ethereum Litecoin, you know they started seeing heaps of growth after Bitcoin was really moving down, so if history repeats itself.
NEUT20|That will most likely happen when Bitcoins starts to, you know, go on those large downward moves.
BEAR21|Now, obviously the uptrend trend line broke, so yeah, we're dancing on knife Seger say at the moment, as we could be looking at like a bearish month because of this.
BEAR22|You know Bitcoin had K. Keep making new highs and then fell short and now we are like kind of slightly moving down and this trader actually believes he expects this to happen after the break out.
NEUT23|So interesting, but we did.
NEUT24|What does this mean for our ground?
BULL25|I still think it means it's going to dollars even if Bitcoin Caesar pretty bearish month.
NEUT26|Just 'cause obviously what happened last time and if it if Bitcoin doesn't see a bearish month, then we'll also see grow fairground I believe so.
NEUT27|It's a bit of a win win and you've got really good positive catalysts going for it at the moment like you have Sia which is like a Italian major Copyright collecting agency while they're launching more than 4,000,000 in FT's on our grand for 95,000 plus creators.
BULL28|And that's just awesome.
BULL29|It's going to serve as a great catalyst.
NEUT30|Now something else that's very interesting about algorithms as its on its own blockchain, which is one of the main things I look for when I'm looking for cryptos.
NEUT31|And another thing is obviously the active founder.
NEUT32|Now you know I don't even need to go over what it's the advantages, it has a fair money because we all know this.
NEUT33|I'm purely, you know, talking charts right now.
NEUT34|Anyway, $2.00 is my price prediction.
NEUT35|If you guys enjoyed the video, leave a like and I'll see you in the next one.
NEUT36|"Bye."""
