NEUT0|"""Hey guys, I'm Naveen deal between CC and let's just confirm I don't know whether it's a good news or bad news, but my job is to tell you about this."
NEUT1|This is a Bloomberg article.
BULL2|An here loses said that they are near the deal to go public via claims pack.
NEUT3|Combined entity could be valued up to 15 billion lucid Motors.
NEUT4|Deal could be announced early next week.
NEUT5|It is written here that special Purpose acquisition company has been in the talks to raise 1 billion and 1.5 billion funding.
NEUT6|From institutional investors to support the transaction and this line is so confusing us, the valuation and the amount of additional funding could still change based on investors demand.
BEAR7|They have added this because of the hype in the market for CCI.
BULL8|Well on Friday CC was done by 8%.
NEUT9|I think this was the reason previously ciie merger with companies was not that good.
NEUT10|These are the previous deals of Civ Market.
NEUT11|Did not appreciate Civ deal but it is written here that the valuation and the amount of.
NEUT12|Additional funding based on investors demand.
NEUT13|Maybe in future they will change the value of this tale and that case.
BEAR14|It may go up, but I don't think after the valuation of 1 billion and 1.5 billion will take Civ anywhere.
BULL15|I think it will go down from here.
NEUT16|That's why people started selling it on Friday.
NEUT17|It's just my opinion you do not have to agree on it.
NEUT18|My job was to update you with this.
