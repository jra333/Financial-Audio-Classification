BEAR0|"""What is going on guys?"
NEUT1|You guys always know we go turn on in here every Thursday afternoon for a watch list for Friday.
NEUT2|'cause Fridays are supposed to be the hot days actually turns out on Fridays.
NEUT3|I don't trade near as much just so you guys know protects those profits.
NEUT4|Those are big things.
NEUT5|With that being said, let's jump right in this video and see what I'm looking at this Friday.
BEAR6|I've been getting dirty money.
BULL7|Hey guys, thank you for watching this video.
NEUT8|Don't forget to hit that.
NEUT9|Thumbs up and subscribe.
NEUT10|I'm always I'm putting out at least one video a week giving you guys absolutely free content that's going to help you guys.
NEUT11|Whether it's long term short term, just in finance and everything like that.
NEUT12|So that being said, let's jump back to the video.
NEUT13|So you guys see that I have this article already up here.
BEAR14|Netflix lumps this quarter 2 earnings Miss weaker quarter three subscribe subscribers, growth forecasts and we don't be wrong.
BEAR15|They did great, but they just didn't hit what they were predicting and that's the big big problem here.
NEUT16|So when it comes down to Netflix, you actually had the earnings estimate was estimate was $1.84, the actual was $1.59 per share, so they did not hit earnings.
BEAR17|That does hurt.
BEAR18|That's why you are seeing this huge gap down after hours, which is 100% OK. That's, I mean that's life.
NEUT19|You're going to keep moving on without it.
NEUT20|Does that **** for shareholders?
BULL21|Yes, 'cause more than likely you will see a dip tomorrow.
NEUT22|So be ready for this dip tomorrow.
BULL23|I think people were gearing up here during mid day to kind of get that expecting good earnings.
NEUT24|And now I said it here.
NEUT25|Live Today.
BEAR26|That more than likely you know, watch Netflix Miss earnings because everybody's overhyping this so much guys.
NEUT27|Just because people are talking about it and saying that it's happening does not mean that it's always going to happen.
BEAR28|I literally set it to one of my students saying that watch Netflix Miss earnings because it's overhyped right now.
NEUT29|I love Netflix.
NEUT30|I personally do use Netflix, but you could have caught this actually called this play out here.
NEUT31|This downturn here in the morning and then I didn't figure that I was going to turn out and go upwards.
NEUT32|So again, I did not play either one of these plays, but I did call the Netflix Play Live with my students, but as that being said this was all hype.
NEUT33|You see this this high at $535.54.
BULL34|That is an absolute high.
BULL35|You see that we did hit a high here or low this after hours at four 4965.
NEUT36|Those basically as soon as everything hit and they let everybody know that they missed earnings.
NEUT37|That's really what you were looking for.
NEUT38|What I'm looking forward tomorrow honestly is just for some stability.
NEUT39|I'm still only going to be day trading guys.
NEUT40|I'm not looking at anything extreme.
NEUT41|One thing I do want to look at here is Vicks, which is the volatility index.
NEUT42|One of those things that you guys should be watching you guys see if it spikes.
BEAR43|That usually means the market does fall.
NEUT44|Go look at it on multiple timeframes.
NEUT45|You guys can kind of tell.
BULL46|We have slowly started pulling back now that the market is starting to get a little bit more stable.
BEAR47|Know the market is not stable guys.
NEUT48|I'm not telling any of you guys to actually go and start swing trading again.
NEUT49|I am personally not swing trading so I would not recommend that to anybody at all guys.
NEUT50|But those are just things that kind of watch for tomorrow.
NEUT51|I will still be day trading apples, my main one.
NEUT52|Roku is the other one that we've been hitting on a lot here lately and then spy like normal.
NEUT53|I do not place.
NEUT54|Buy as much I do, just kind of watch it.
NEUT55|I would rather play Apple and Roku with my strategy or Netflix or Amazon again.
NEUT56|But if you guys want to play those two bigger ones or even Google, you guys are going to have to spend more money.
NEUT57|I'm just 100% transparent with everybody and I don't want to be asked anybody.
BULL58|So with that being said, guys, I hope this does help you as I hope you guys all make good money on Friday.
NEUT59|And if you guys are alive let me know and I will see you guys leave a comment below and let me know what you guys really want me to breakdown in the next video.
NEUT60|"Over the weekend I will see you guys then."""
