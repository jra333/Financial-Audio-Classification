NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|It's May 8th, 2018 and today we're going to look at the euro versus the US dollar on the daily chart so your dollar continues to stretch lower after breaking below the 200 day moving average for the first time since November 2017.
BEAR2|Last week it's currently trading at one point 1908, but yesterday we saw the market falling slightly below the one point 19 key level to touch one point 1896.
NEUT3|Any the short term this is so not unlikely to happen.
BEAR4|Again this is we could see the price extending this downtrend because if you look at the 20 day moving average the line is still negatively sloped below the 50 day in May while the red 10 constant line also shows no sign of reversing to the upside.
BEAR5|Moreover, Mcatee down here gives further negative signal since it continues to fluctuate up below 0 and it's red signal line.
BULL6|So on the way down the price could meet the four month low one point 1896 I reached yesterday before it moves.
NEUT7|To touch the one point 90 key level?
NEUT8|Uh then, if this level fails to hold, the next target could be the 78.6% people Nachi of the applet for one point 1553 to one point 2554.
NEUT9|This is at one point, 1766.
BEAR10|However, we still cannot exclude any upside movement in the short term because there is side down here continues to move below 13 oversold areas, suggesting that the rebound could be around the corner.
BULL11|So I bounced above the 61.8%.
NEUT12|All natural one point 1935 could run towards the area between the 200 day moving average currently at one point 2919 and the 50% people natural.
NEUT13|One point 2054.
NEUT14|Then I close up from here could shift focus to the 38.2% people natural one point 2171 aware the 20 day moving average is also located at the moment.
NEUT15|And how about the medium term picture.
BEAR16|Your dollar turned bearish after baking.
NEUT17|This range bound trading started.
BEAR18|In mid January and is likely to remain bearish if the price fails to close above the 200 day moving average.
NEUT19|So that's all from me.
BULL20|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
