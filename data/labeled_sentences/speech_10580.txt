NEUT0|"""To be crystal clear here does a blue wave mean legalization?"
NEUT1|Doubtful, decriminalization may be an easier regulatory environment for legitimate weed operations.
NEUT2|Absolutely.
NEUT3|So how do we play?
NEUT4|OK, here's what we're not going to do, despite the fact that many of you asked me repeatedly, forget it, you're not getting your way.
NEUT5|We're not going to buy most of the Canadian licensed producers, and I am talking about a free Aurora, Cannabis, Cronos, Tilray.
NEUT6|Oh sorry, some of these stocks spiked or this month along with the rest of the Cannabis Co. Are these companies already operate in Canada?
NEUT7|Weed is legal, they've destroyed you.
BULL8|Then I'm going to benefit as much from an easier regulatory environment.
NEUT9|United States.
BULL10|At the end, the day I think we're far more likely to see a booming domestic production then a Sergeant Cady inputs.
NEUT11|We're dealing with politics here.
NEUT12|If there's a way for legislators to reward their own constituents first, that's what they're going to do.
NEUT13|More importantly, though, we know from the Canadian experience that the producers ****** way to play legalization.
NEUT14|Growing weed is insanely properly because it's illegal or tightly regulated.
NEUT15|When you legalize everyone start scoring as much as they can and the price plummets.
NEUT16|I'm afraid here, for instance, in this area.
NEUT17|This is a great Pinot noir area for people like peanuts.
NEUT18|And the Pinot war guys ripped out all their Pinot warbritton treat device, which were so great.
NEUT19|I'm telling you some great pinots and they put in pot and the price of pot pummeled and the price of Pinot went up.
NEUT20|And what does that tell you?
NEUT21|Drink wine OK.
NEUT22|Anyway, it becomes just like you know the commodity.
NEUT23|I like the Flowers by the way for the pinot, except producers have even less discipline because everyone in the industry is a neo fight with no experience.
NEUT24|I have one exception to this rule and its canopy growth.
BULL25|That Canadian based producers got a huge slug of cash from Constellation Brands.
BULL26|STZ see long term the stock has been a total Bow Wow, although it shows some life of late Canopy could work because they have an arrangement which will give them control.
NEUT27|The large US operator acres Holies of course is still grower.
BULL28|But it's also got a relationship with Constellation Brands.
NEUT29|Think Corona, modello, that could give them a leg up when it comes to THC infused beverages.
NEUT30|By the way, you cannot.
NEUT31|It'll be separate the bars with THC, and then they'll be bars with beer.
NEUT32|I doubt that they'll mix.
NEUT33|That's what I'm told by the Congress ending.
NEUT34|Still, there are better ways to play it.
NEUT35|Take Grow generation A roll up of retailers that sells hydroponic equipment.
NEUT36|Basically it's the Lowe's or Home Depot for anyone looking to grow something indoors.
NEUT37|Could be marijuana.
NEUT38|It could be some other plan.
NEUT39|Who's to say?
NEUT40|Maybe geraniums?
BULL41|Grow generation pretty much has the space to itself, and it's got a critic, regional national growth plan just the last couple weeks they bought a store in Arizona marking the 11th state that they've entered and two locations in Michigan.
BULL42|We spoke to the CEO in August and he painted a compelling picture.
BULL43|Since then, the stocks only up a couple of bucks.
NEUT44|It did travel to the Moon and back.
BULL45|I think it's got more room to run.
NEUT46|What else?
NEUT47|How about this one innovative industrial properties.
NEUT48|We've talked about.
NEUT49|This supports real estate investment trusts, specialized properties that they leased to licensed medical marijuana facilities.
NEUT50|If you think we'll see a booming cannabis production, don't bet on grow or better on the growers landlord.
BULL51|IRS Valley, roughly 70% for the year though, but it's still got a 3.6% yield.
BEAR52|Stocks pulled back over the past week.
NEUT53|I like at these levels.
