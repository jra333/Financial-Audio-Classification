BULL0|"""Good to see you, Doug."
NEUT1|What do you anticipate in for this in terms of where it looks like it's going to go at, which is, you know, 65.
NEUT2|Let's say per unit and what its pricing it at this point given were coming out of the pandemic and we're going to enter tougher comps.
BULL3|Well, I think the price to me says that consensus as you talked about in the last segment is that they're going to have very strong growth and continued growth coming out of the pandemic tailwind that they had where they were up over 100% year over year for bookings and revenue.
BULL4|If you look at the company's projections for 2 billion in bookings this year, that's about 10% year over year growth.
NEUT5|So it is a difficult comp.
NEUT6|But it seems like they are maintaining the users that came onto the platform during the pandemic.
NEUT7|And are continuing to spend a lot of time on the platform.
NEUT8|I'm a little surprised how high the price is given this is a direct listing.
BULL9|Normally we don't see big moves like this out of the gate for a direct listing, but I think people are very excited that they're finally able to invest in Roblox.
NEUT10|Yeah, especially as every single share is eligible to be sold from early investors to to insiders, etc.
NEUT11|How should we look at that growth then Doug, since it did see astronomical growth because of the pandemic, but in its latest forecast, for instance, fardier use growth is expected to be 59 to 60.
NEUT12|Percent year on year.
NEUT13|But for the second quarter, that growth is must be 3 to 9% year on year and that gets to that heart of tougher comps.
NEUT14|Or do you still price it as a high growth company even though we're not seeing those metrics bear out?
NEUT15|I think you really have to think about the next three to five years and what that growth picture looks like.
BULL16|And if you move beyond these tough comps, I think you're going to see a company that's probably growing something more in the strong double digits year over year.
BULL17|I think they could sustain, you know, let's say something like 20 to 30% annual revenue or bookings growth over the next several years.
BULL18|And I think that is probably a better indication than what we're seeing right now off that tough conference last year.
NEUT19|And what, in your view, is the most important metric?
NEUT20|There was a study out.
NEUT21|From sensor tower, that lifetime player spending across App Store and Google Play was two and a half billion dollars with about half of that coming just last year.
NEUT22|So so is it.
NEUT23|Is it revenue per user?
NEUT24|Revenue per user, over the lifetime of the player is a day use?
NEUT25|I mean what do you use the most important metric?
NEUT26|I think it's two things.
NEUT27|I look very closely at bookings.
NEUT28|I mean, that's just an indication of how much people are just spending on the platform.
NEUT29|Buying Robux, which is the virtual currency that fuels the economy in the game.
NEUT30|And the other thing I look at is the amount of time spent.
BULL31|I think if we continue to see time spent be stable and even continue to grow some, that's a good tailwind that provides users a reason to keep spending money on that currency in the game.
NEUT32|And this is one that's been mentioned a lot on the Reddit chat board, so I know you've pointed that out to our producers.
BEAR33|Is that a good thing or a bad thing for a company just hitting the public market?
NEUT34|Certainly good thing in the near term in terms of absolute stock price, I think anytime Reddit gets ahold of something, you have to probably be a little bit cautious.
NEUT35|If you're looking at it as a long term investor, that's always how we think about investing at loop.
NEUT36|And so when you see like we talked about earlier, a move of 50% in a direct listing on day one, it gives us a little bit of pause about what the near term could bring.
BULL37|But I still think you've got a company that has great growth prospects.
BULL38|They have a very stable user base and they really own that preteen demo.
BULL39|And so I do think it's a great company to keep an eye on for long term investing, even if the near term here is a little bit choppier, because of that excitement.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
