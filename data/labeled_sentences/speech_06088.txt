NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol SPO T Spotify."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs going to be watching this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal automatically would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up there above $3 and six or excuse me not $3.
NEUT8|Excuse me $306.00 now don't get me wrong if the price falls below 306.
NEUT9|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage stay above that level.
BULL10|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword.
BULL15|Definitely moving.
BEAR16|I get the price is way up here.
NEUT17|This line is way down here, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, this right here is how I'm defining quote unquote the move just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT18|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|Having this, visualize that that is what he's been representing.
NEUT20|Sure, stand above.
NEUT21|That level would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT22|Main level to watch moving forward.
NEUT23|Me right up there at the 325 mark and then if the price and get a good solid break of 325I.
BULL24|Mean knows no such thing as a guarantee but a good high volume break of 325I could very realistically see the price making a push up to 3:30 if not even higher than that.
NEUT25|But All in all any angle you look at it.
BULL26|Fantastic volume today.
BULL27|Very impressive price movement.
NEUT28|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
