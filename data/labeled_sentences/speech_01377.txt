BEAR0|"""So Facebook shares their first full day of trading down 11% at about just a hair above $34 a share."
NEUT1|Steve Morgan Stanley, the banking company that arranged this.
NEUT2|This is the after hours trading, so it's not even more in after hours and continue going down.
NEUT3|Morgan Stanley taking a lot of heat for this.
BEAR4|This idea that stuff this has been a big flop.
NEUT5|I mean this has been one of the one of the biggest IPO's ever.
NEUT6|Just it really.
NEUT7|There was so much demand there was so much anticipation leading up to this.
BEAR8|And the big problem right now is that there seems there was too many shares out in the market that there weren't enough demand to meet the supply shares out there.
BEAR9|And so you saw on the IPO day on Friday that the stock just had a little bit of a pop and came right back down and kept bouncing off along the $38.00 level.
NEUT10|That's the IPO level.
NEUT11|And you saw you could just see it by watching a chart that Morgan Stanley, another under writers, were in there and they were.
NEUT12|They were propping up the stock.
NEUT13|Did they do anything today?
NEUT14|Do we know that we don't know?
NEUT15|We don't know that.
BEAR16|But if you just look at the chart, though, it looks like they didn't do much right because the stock came way down and so.
BEAR17|You know it was down as much as 14%.
BEAR18|I think it's finished down 11% today and you could just see that it may have found some sort of support or some sort of floor.
BEAR19|It was around $3334 level, but it's still still still dropping in the after hours.
NEUT20|So the quote I like from this story, by Gina Chon Chon.
BEAR21|Andrew Fitzgerald says, quote the under writers completely screwed this up and quit.
NEUT22|Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities.
NEUT23|The offering quote should have been half as big as it was an it would have closed at 45, he said.
NEUT24|So is why you kind of hinting out there that some people are greedy.
NEUT25|Perhaps just a little bit, just a little bit, just like I mean there's a valuation problem, right?
NEUT26|I mean, this is for $100 billion company.
NEUT27|It just doesn't.
NEUT28|It's not growing, and it doesn't let me rephrase that.
BEAR29|It doesn't have sales slowing growth is slowing.
NEUT30|It doesn't have the sales and profits that you know, $100 billion company needs to happen.
NEUT31|So that's the big worry right now.
BEAR32|And I think that if you compare it to what some of the other big tech companies are trading at, if you look at Apple, Google, this stock is still way overvalued and still very expensive compared to those other ones.
NEUT33|Well, the line I'd liked.
NEUT34|But I sort of the weekend on Twitter with someone putting out there.
NEUT35|That, oh, you know, if Facebook.
BEAR36|I'm sorry.
NEUT37|Applewood family the same way as Facebook, it be worth almost 4000 bucks exactly which.
BEAR38|Which is ridiculous.
BEAR39|I mean, so clearly there's a lot of worries here.
BEAR40|Is this a black eye for Morgan Stanley?
NEUT41|It's a black eye.
BEAR42|It's a black eye right now.
NEUT43|I think this is one of those things where you know there's going to be a lot of attention around what Facebook shares are doing in the first few days.
NEUT44|But ultimately I think you could see it settle at some point.
NEUT45|Maybe you know, in the low 30s, which is where the stock was originally priced.
NEUT46|That was the original price range before that.
NEUT47|The under writers boosted it and there seems to be a little bit more hype and anticipation, so, you know, is greater factor absolutely?
NEUT48|I mean, there's no question, and then I think if they had just stuck with their original price range, they wouldn't be in this issue in this predicament right now, so I'm sure we'll be hearing about this for awhile and there's a lot of red faces around their Morgan Stanley.
BULL49|"Thank you very much."""
