NEUT0|"""The breaking news after the Bell."
NEUT1|Facebook's earnings report.
BULL2|A lot of anticipation for this report and now the stock is trading higher and after hours trading following an earnings per share beat in the last quarter.
BEAR3|$1.76 per share versus an estimate of $1.47.
BEAR4|Now when we reported these numbers to you little while ago, we were looking at the fact that Facebook reported revenue that was slightly below analyst estimates.
BEAR5|An also would look to be slower user growth than some analysts were looking for so.
NEUT6|Now that we've had some time, Jack Sheyne are back with us.
NEUT7|With their impressions of this, it's it's interesting Jack, that the.
NEUT8|Earnings per share number seems to be what is driving things now versus with other companies and even Facebook when it first came out.
NEUT9|You'd be looking at the at the top line figure.
NEUT10|What do you make of the reaction?
NEUT11|Not necessarily the report.
NEUT12|The kind of market that we're in.
NEUT13|You have to be nervous about your story stocks, stocks where they don't have the earnings today.
NEUT14|They're supposed to have a 10 years from now.
BULL15|There's a lot of hope and excitement.
NEUT16|You know you have to be nervous about this is not a story stock.
BEAR17|This is company a company with a ton of cash pouring in right now and the outlook look.
NEUT18|It's no longer a go go growth company.
BULL19|But for a company that trades at about the same price as the broad stock market, it has much better growth than the broad stock market.
BULL20|So I think the value here is pretty attractive.
BEAR21|Like I said, there could easily be some turbulence over the next couple of quarters long term ad dollars flow online and there's only about 3 big companies out there getting at this one alphabet.
NEUT22|An increasingly Amazon.
BEAR23|I think there was a question chanted to Jack's point about a value for Facebook, because when that last quarter report came out and granted it was disastrous.
BEAR24|In many ways the stock got hammered.
BEAR25|It was down more than 35% from that report in July up until today.
NEUT26|So maybe you know investors those like Battle Johnson was on earlier and others who are bullish about the future for Facebook are saying, yeah, we're back in here.
BULL27|We see some value in the stock, even if we still have some questions.
NEUT28|What do you think?
NEUT29|I think there are.
BULL30|There is continued value in the stock and that's why I was.
NEUT31|I'm hesitant to make any any calls on Facebook right now given especially a couple things that are coming up.
NEUT32|You have got the political season coming.
NEUT33|I mean, the earnings next quarter are going to reflect potentially highest political spend ever on Facebook ads.
NEUT34|You also have Instagram pulling in more, more money and their Messenger app that they're increasingly pouring themselves into.
BULL35|And in order to increase monetization there, so there are bright spots for Facebook.
NEUT36|And I think that it is too soon to you know, to call it.
BEAR37|I hate to keep kicking the can down the road.
NEUT38|It's understandable, by the way, in the market.
NEUT39|In general, it's tough to make a prediction from 10 minutes to the next thing that's swinging lately, but is there a broader story here for Facebook like we were told Jack to expect in markets after Amazon and Alphabet reported?
NEUT40|Or is this because Facebook has so many companies specific issues?
NEUT41|A Facebook story tonight and tomorrow?
NEUT42|I think there's going to be a sorting out process in the market right now for a long time.
NEUT43|Growth has worked and it didn't matter what was growing.
NEUT44|It all went up and I think investors right now want a little bit more value for their money.
BEAR45|So there I think investors will increasingly be sceptical about the Tesla's.
NEUT46|Maybe even the Netflix is the companies respecting to have earnings down the road, but they're going to be looking at the alphabets in the Facebook.
NEUT47|They're going to say look at those cash flows.
NEUT48|These are not highpriced.com wonders.
NEUT49|These are pretty attractive almost value stocks at these prices and for now.
BULL50|Even with the numbers, we talked about, some of the concerns stocks up 3 plus percent Jack and Shayna.
BULL51|Thanks to you both we appreciate it.
BULL52|"Thank you."""
