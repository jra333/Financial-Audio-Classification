NEUT0|"""A quick interview on the trade tariffs."
NEUT1|Let's see where's my photographer or she's right behind us, OK?
NEUT2|Rolling we're here with Steve Forbes and Arjun, Defender of Freedom and I wanted to ask him what he thought of the trade tariffs that Trump just imposed tariffs are another word for tax and more taxes.
BULL3|Not good low taxes, better no taxes, even better.
NEUT4|So it's not going to do more harm than good and so the quicker we get away from thinking that taxes are the solutions for anything.
NEUT5|The better it just makes all the products more expensive, right?
BEAR6|It makes it harder for business to do business here with what economists call inputs become more expensive.
NEUT7|It varies as prices.
BEAR8|It hurts job creation.
NEUT9|So if you got a problem, a trade you work to reduce the barriers, not increase them, right?
NEUT10|So what is comparative advantage?
NEUT11|Because that's the theory that proves that.
NEUT12|Protectionism.
NEUT13|Import, substitution, mercantilism, whatever you want to call it is a big mistake, and that was we owe that Adam Smith is not new, right?
NEUT14|Ricardo came up with the phrase, and it's a fancy way of saying, let people buy and sell with each other and we'll all be better off, right?
NEUT15|So we it's better if they want to sell us things really cheap.
NEUT16|But whatever they call it dumping or whatever.
NEUT17|Well, who doesn't like cheap goods?
NEUT18|Well, you know we always have rules of the road, but calling this national security everything is national security.
NEUT19|If you think of it that way so well, let's keep the taxes away.
NEUT20|And if their abuse is deal with the abuse is but don't punish the consumer.
NEUT21|It's a big sale, right?
NEUT22|If they if they want to sell us cheap stuff, right?
NEUT23|Yeah well, the only thing that shouldn't be cheap as Forbes magazine.
NEUT24|You're free to sell it at whatever price you want, right?
BULL25|"Thank you."""
