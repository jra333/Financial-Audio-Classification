BULL0|"""My name is Fred Castano from East Pointe, Michigan, and I appreciate this opportunity with Berkshire size becoming very large."
NEUT1|Are we to expect major future investments to be in the form of complete buyouts such as the General Re acquisition?
NEUT2|Or would you still consider nibling in the stock market?
NEUT3|Well, we we we don't want to know but we would like to take big Gulps in the stock market from time to time.
NEUT4|But we we've always wanted to acquire entire businesses people.
NEUT5|Never seemed to really believe that back when we were buying sees candy or the Buffalo News or National Indemnity Book, that's been our number one preference right along.
NEUT6|It's just that we found that much of the time we could get far more for our money in terms of wonderful businesses by buying pieces in the stock market than we could buy negotiated purchase.
NEUT7|There may have been, there may be some movement in terms of the availability of the two tored the negotiated purchase, although it's almost impossible to make a wonderful by negotiated purchase.
NEUT8|I mean it, you will never make the kind of bianna negotiated purchase.
NEUT9|That you can, in a bad style that you can make via stocks in about in stock in a in a week stock market.
NEUT10|It just isn't going to happen.
NEUT11|Person on the other side cares too much whereas in the in the in the stock market in a 1973 or 4 you were dealing with the marginal seller, Anan whatever price they established for the business.
NEUT12|You could buy it.
NEUT13|I couldn't have bought the entire Washington Post Company for $80 million in 1974, but I could I could.
NEUT14|I could buy 10% of it from a bunch of people who.
NEUT15|We're just operating, you know, based on calculating betas or doing something of the sort, and they were in a terrible market an it was possible to buy a piece of it on that valuation.
NEUT16|You never get that kind of buy in in a negotiated purchase.
NEUT17|We always are more interested in negotiated, large, negotiated deals and we are in stock purchases.
NEUT18|But we we are not going to find a way probably to use all the money that way and an we occasionally may get chances to put big chunks of money.
NEUT19|Into attractive businesses that are which we buy through the stock market.
NEUT20|510% of the company or something of that sort.
NEUT21|Charlie, my guess is over the next five years will do some of both.
NEUT22|Both for the entire business and the Big gulps in the stock market.
BULL23|Yeah, I agree with that.
NEUT24|They will keep working at both.
NEUT25|We're not finding a lot in either arena.
NEUT26|We might be a little more likely to find it in the negotiated business.
NEUT27|It won't be any huge bargain.
NEUT28|We're not going to get any huge market in the in the in ago Sheated purchase.
NEUT29|Where are more likely to find what I would call a fair deal there under today's circumstances?
NEUT30|Then then we will in the market.
BULL31|But I agree with Charlie.
NEUT32|"Over the next five years, I think you'll see us do both."""
