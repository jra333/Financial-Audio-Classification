BEAR0|"""Walmart has a Goodyear gone."
NEUT1|This is a weekly Walmart charred empties.
BULL2|And what we're looking for is that Walmart once again has a four week weekly buy signal.
NEUT3|AM.
NEUT4|I've been teaching all of the MMT's.
NEUT5|When they do get these weekly buy signals, how weekly by signals work to the upside.
BULL6|Walmart has lived up to that expectation and now that we are.
BULL7|Up here within the strong weekly by Signal now.
BEAR8|We're also 90.73% overbought within that great rally movement and not only that you can clearly see that this is the calendar year.
NEUT9|Add which you can clearly see.
BULL10|What a great job it did when it broke up on this last weekly bar and made all time highs and broke right up there.
NEUT11|What we're going to be watching is how overbought Walmart gets from the from that bottom base rally up.
BULL12|What a great move.
BULL13|That's a huge move.
NEUT14|$50 to $59.
NEUT15|For Walmart it takes a long time for Walmart to move.
BULL16|It took seven weeks to move $9, but now we're getting up where we're going to see if we can break above that trendline.
BEAR17|But we're extremely overbought.
BEAR18|The more overbought it gets.
NEUT19|It will have its weekly corrections like it did here.
NEUT20|It will have weekly corrections and it will have weekly corrections and Walmart will have weekly corrections from overbought levels and you can see them throughout the year.
NEUT21|I'm pointing them out clearly and the same thing is going to happen over here.
NEUT22|Great Weekly by signal.
BULL23|Great weekly bullish breakout.
NEUT24|Everything in that order is all kicking cylinders.
NEUT25|And that side of the trade is already performed.
NEUT26|The upside is limited from here.
NEUT27|And we would be looking at the more overbought it gets decided by the put options below the market and make money from its current.
NEUT28|Overbought criteria that meets the SMF market maker.
NEUT29|Qualifier is it's on the list and the radar.
NEUT30|As of now overbought Walmart can get overbought more looking at the other side I had to put put options below the market and make a gain.
BULL31|The higher that we get overbought and we have a bullish weekly buy signal on it, which is nice.
BEAR32|And the higher we go, we will get a pullback at some point.
BULL33|This is a Goodyear Walmart performs and it's been rallying anticipation of good numbers at year end and it's getting built into the stock price.
BULL34|"So the good news is built in because we've rallied in anticipation."""
