NEUT0|"""Alright, so let's say you're at a big cocktail party, maybe tonight and somebody you don't know comes up to you and ask for a meeting now."
BEAR1|This person, by the way, has also just put out a 54 page report slamming your company for selling counterfeit goods and cause your employees minions so it happens to you tonight.
NEUT2|How do you respond well?
NEUT3|That's what Jeff Bezos asked on Instagram yesterday, throwing a bit of shade at White House economist Peter Navarro, who says that he asked multiple times to meet with Bezos, but was only offered other senior executives even after Bezos agreed at something called the Alfalfa Club Cocktail party in DC last month to meet when Navarro came up to him in person.
NEUT4|Think you've got the best responses to Bezos is Instagram post?
NEUT5|He says they will send you a Seinfeld serenity now.
NEUT6|But so basically Navarro walked up the Bezos, your buddy Sarah, and was like hey, which was my buddy.
NEUT7|Tomorrow we needed to meet.
NEUT8|We can we meet.
NEUT9|And Bezos is like yeah, call Jay Carney the head of their PR and we'll get it done.
NEUT10|But I guess in the parlance as ghosted him since then.
BEAR11|And Navarro was deeply offended by that, and was angry.
BEAR12|I think he's mad.
NEUT13|He, like Bezos parent.
NEUT14|Lee was like, sure, we'll meet.
NEUT15|Well, maybe there's a difference.
NEUT16|A bizarre difference in the understanding of what the proper protocol is.
NEUT17|Maybe Bezos feels like it should be a principals meeting.
NEUT18|In other words, not somebody who works for the president.
NEUT19|I don't know what goes on at the Alfalfa Club, but maybe you should not supposed to talk about some of these clubs you don't talk business.
NEUT20|I think it's an interesting lesson.
NEUT21|And what to do if you don't really want to meet with someone?
NEUT22|"Just say I got a guy who fell hook us up."""
