BEAR1|At the moment he's close to reverse the app Liquid the top at 114.73 started in the middle of September from 107.31 and negative extensions became increasingly became steeper after.
BEAR2|The market cross successfully below the 50% people Nachi Annecke mark of 110.83 which as you can see this is the lower bound of this range.
BEAR3|The background remains bearish in the short term.
BEAR4|Prices are still far below the McLeod and the moving average lines momentum is negative as well.
BEAR5|If we look at the other side, the index is below its neutral threshold zone of 50.
BEAR6|Ann is currently slightly below 30.
BULL7|Moving sideways, which means that we might see some consolidation in the near term.
BEAR8|Market gives further negative signals.
NEUT9|Over here, the histogram is still below the red signal line.
NEUT10|Now looking for support levels before the half months.
BULL11|Loaf 108.27 could be an immediate support, but it will be interesting to see the pair stretching below 107.31 because any downside violation of this one year more than a year low will turn.
NEUT12|The medium term outlook from neutral to bearish again in this case we would likely see the market testing the area between 106 and one hundred 105.
NEUT13|Are now looking to the upside.
BULL14|The 10 concern point at 109.78 could provide resistance before prices move higher to 61.8%.
NEUT15|People Nachi of 110.13 about from here.
BULL16|A stronger resistance could come from 111 key level.
BEAR17|This is the 50% Fibonacci end, the frequently congested area.
BEAR18|So any close above this would increase bullish actions towards 112.
BULL19|In 113, however, the pair would resume this long term bullish picture only if it managed to move higher up well above 114.73.
NEUT20|So that's all for me.
BULL21|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
