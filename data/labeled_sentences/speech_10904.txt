NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel.
NEUT2|Let's talk about Neo stock.
NEUT3|So Neo out of all the stocks that I own is the only one up on the day.
BEAR4|Today is a red day.
NEUT5|And there is one reason why is because Neil is releasing a new luxury sedan vehicle.
NEUT6|If I Scroll down you can see it in the first news watchlist.
NEUT7|They're unveiling the new luxury sedan.
BULL8|This is big news because it's going to compete with Tesla's luxury cars that they currently have.
NEUT9|So I think Neil is setting itself up to be $100 stock.
NEUT10|Honestly, they're making all the right moves.
NEUT11|I am really looking forward to what Neil holds in the future, but I only own a few shares in deal and there's a reason why I set this in my other videos is because Neo is more risk that then I'm willing to put a lot into an.
NEUT12|That is because it is a foreign stock an with any foreign stock from any foreign country.
NEUT13|It's a risk because you're not in the country.
NEUT14|You don't know the language.
NEUT15|You don't know the culture, so it's hard to really gauge the things that you need to gauge to move forward or to, you know, put a lot of money into a stock, so that's why I don't own a lot of Neil shares.
BULL16|I'm going to still add to the position, of course, but it's going to be very limited due to the fact that.
NEUT17|All it takes is 1 bad news.
BEAR18|The CEO going missing.
NEUT19|Like you know Alibaba just a few weeks ago or they're cooking the books.
NEUT20|You know, like you know, lucking coffee you know.
NEUT21|So I see a trend in these things.
NEUT22|And Neo hasn't shown any any negative aspects.
NEUT23|The only negative thing is being delisted, you know.
BEAR24|And that was another problem with Alibaba, is that it was on the verge of being delisted, and I think it still is.
BEAR25|And that's why the stock is continuing to drop.
NEUT26|So a lot of people say that that is value.
BEAR27|Oh my God, the price is going down.
BULL28|This is a good deal.
NEUT29|No, it's a value trap.
NEUT30|There's a reason why people are selling and there's reason why Neo is continuing to go up.
BULL31|You know, it's it's doing a great job in the market.
BULL32|It's coming up with new, innovative ways to stay relevant, just like Tesla, and it's really going *** for tat.
NEUT33|Honestly, it's in there duking it out.
NEUT34|You know, trying to compete with Tesla?
NEUT35|I love competition, and that's why I love Neil.
BULL36|"So I'll continue to dollar cost average into Neil and I hope to see a lot of good results in the future, so I hope you guys like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video."""
