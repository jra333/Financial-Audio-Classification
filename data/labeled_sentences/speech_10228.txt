BULL0|"""Now, since they've made real improvements, though, there's some good changes here."
NEUT1|They brought in a new CEO, Vivek Shanklin from PepsiCo Smart.
NEUT2|They spent billions renovating the stores and building out their new Omni channel business.
NEUT3|They now offer delivery at the fast majority of the locations.
NEUT4|Most importantly, did pay down there a lot of their debt when I was trying to come public in 2015.
BEAR5|Its net debt stood colossal.
NEUT6|$12 billion, close to 12 million.
BEAR7|Then they brought it down to 8.7 billion.
BULL8|As of end of last year, which are much more reasonable number for a company that generated two point.
NEUT9|8 billion in earnings before interest, taxes, appreciation and admiration last year.
NEUT10|And you know what?
BULL11|All these moves are working after years of stagnating Albertson's sales grew by more than 3% last year.
BULL12|2% same store sales growth.
NEUT13|Not big.
BULL14|Big improvement, where they were even better by paying down all that debt they've given the earnings of dramatic boots last year, Albertson's made four and 66 million.
BULL15|That's up from 131,000,000 last year.
NEUT16|And most of that increase has to do with smaller interest payments.
NEUT17|I like that.
BULL18|Oh, and we know that they've been getting a major boost from COVID-19 because they just gave us a business update last week.
BULL19|Albertson's says they've experienced, and I quote significant increases in customer traffic, product demand, and overall basket size in stores and its Commerce, business, and quote since the company's fiscal year started March.
BULL20|That's really good.
BULL21|Get this same source sales increased by 47% year over year in March of 21% in April.
BULL22|In May, that translates into 30% same store sales growth for the first quarter of the 2020 twenty fiscal year.
NEUT23|Other supermarkets have had similar.
NEUT24|That's what happened during the pandemic companies.
BULL25|Margins are picking up too.
BULL26|That's great, and that's important because a better execution told her new management.
BEAR27|Thanks all this money coming in management said they've gotten their net debt load down to 6.7 billion by late may manageable.
BULL28|Just cleaning up that balance sheet will keep producing some tremendous earnings growth.
BULL29|In short, the operations of today is a much better company than that of 2018 or 2015.
BEAR30|And look with this latest big Covid outbreak in the South and West.
BULL31|The supermarkets could end up getting more of a boost, and you might expect.
NEUT32|Obviously it's temporary.
NEUT33|It's pantry stocking, but there's a big difference between three months of insanely high sales and six or nine months have insanely high sales.
BULL34|Thanks to all this improvement.
NEUT35|When a person says they plan to pay a dividend with the target of 2.5%, I believe I love it when a company comes public with the dividend alright, but there are still some service will remain in control.
BEAR36|The company even after the IPO, either Cerberus sells later putting pressure on the stock or the public.
NEUT37|Shareholders don't get a say in how the business is run and not that great.
BULL38|Plus the grocery business is incredibly competitive.
NEUT39|This is what I worry about.
BEAR40|Lots of players with deep pockets, especially Costco and Walmart, and I think the industry could be in a tough spot once we get a covid vaccine.
NEUT41|But put it all together and I think that Albertson's could be worth owning.
NEUT42|But, and this is the big but that I didn't have to feel like when the great merchandise came now it's gotta start coming at the right price, I say, but something no more than $2425.
NEUT43|It's definitely not best to break, but it's not garbage either.
