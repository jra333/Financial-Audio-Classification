BEAR0|"""If you think Donald Trump's Twitter pronouncements are outrageous, then take a look at Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines was sworn in back in June."
BEAR1|Since then, he has launched a brutal campaign against the drugs trade and pursued increasingly erratic foreign policy's, the peso and the Philippine stock market have both fallen.
NEUT2|But is that decline really all down to alarm, about President Duterte possibly not take the currency first of all.
BEAR3|Down 5% against the dollar since June, but virtually all currencies have fallen against the greenback.
BEAR4|Even the Singapore dollar has fallen and if you want to see a currency sell off driven largely by politics, then look at the Turkish lira down almost a fifth.
NEUT5|In the same time.
NEUT6|Now on to the stock market.
NEUT7|This chart shows the PSE index over the past ten years.
NEUT8|The peak in July was close to an all time high and at that point the index was trading at 23 times historic earnings.
BULL9|That's one of the highest ratings in Asia with economic growth poised to moderate, although two is still impressive, 6 1/2 percent next year, and the earnings of established companies coming under pressure from competition.
NEUT10|Some retracement was perhaps inevitable.
NEUT11|"Still, foreign investors have sold almost $500 million worth of Philippine stocks since Duterte's inauguration, but this chart shows that the correlation between net buying or selling and future returns is very weak periods of selling by foreign investors are just as likely to be followed by market gains as they are to be followed by market losses."""
