BEAR0|"""Hey guys there is no way I could not come on today."
NEUT1|As you know we did our Sunday night YouTube update on the Apple stock and I mean this was just absolutely beautiful.
NEUT2|It is exactly what we expected.
NEUT3|You know we had this ramp push and I actually had bought some puts up here waiting for sort of a retest invalidation of some of the levels that we had.
NEUT4|Traded previously and you can tell we just sort of consolidated, traded sideways for a few days and then once we hit our sort of 125 we mentioned looking left and seeing where the resistance would be.
BEAR5|You know we came back up, had a minor correction the last couple of days and you know when I was seeing anything under 1/21/22 I was buying up calls.
NEUT6|Believe me I was waiting for this channel as we sort of upwards band breakout.
BULL7|We're not over overbought an we were definitely do for this sort of break out an.
BEAR8|You know, apples been sort of a sort of boring stock the last three months, and you know, I just super stoked about it.
BULL9|I traded up it had great news today regarding the fitness app regarding the iPhone ramp.
BULL10|I think they're going to 30% production.
NEUT11|I mean, all the news that you could expect.
NEUT12|So if you follow me again, you're probably buying calls, binds, shares and then we just have this crazy breakout.
BEAR13|I mean, we just destroyed all previous resistance.
NEUT14|I mean, look at the.
BEAR15|Resistance back in iPhone.
NEUT16|We talked about the one 25126 guys we got to 127 levels we haven't seen since September so I'm just excited.
NEUT17|If you're an Apple, long, congratulations.
NEUT18|If you're an Apple, something about options and a trade, congratulations, but I had said it come on just to kind of give an update and just really congratulate people 'cause this is a move that we've waited patiently for an.
NEUT19|So I sold all my calls.
BEAR20|I've definitely sold way too early.
BEAR21|I wasn't expecting anything over 125 today and we just ripped open.
BULL22|So if you're able to sort of get up the top and you can see we retraced 50% of the gains and now we're going right back up.
NEUT23|So if you're able to sell or hold or flip congrads, again, we don't see this type of move every day where we're up almost $5.
BULL24|OK guys, good luck.
NEUT25|As always.
