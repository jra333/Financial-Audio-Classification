NEUT0|"""Alright guys, what's up it's your boy will back on that video today I will be talking about AMC stock now."
NEUT1|Give you guys my analyst and predictions on the stock going forward, so make sure you guys like the video that describes an internal publication.
NEUT2|So you don't miss any updates on stocks and let's get into it.
NEUT3|So today it did have a drop museum in.
NEUT4|So today it did have that drop off and then it just traded sideways, right?
NEUT5|So the way I'm playing AMC now is I'm just trying to play the quick pop up like that.
BEAR6|With these popups this pop up, but as you can see, they're going lower and lower each day.
NEUT7|This pop up, that's really all I'm trying to play.
NEUT8|I'm not holding this long term anymore because it looks like it is dying out, but I'm just looking for these and now that is going closer to the support level that I had for awhile now at $5.16 I want to see how price reacts at this level and see if it has any buying pressure, because if it does and we start to see some type of run up like this off this level then I will give him for quick, entered a play and then I'll get out.
NEUT9|Harley Ave High but I have to wait to see how reactions level so just have this level on you guys chart because if it breaks through that then I see the level around $3.35 then I'll probably play off of so that's really like the two levels I see.
NEUT10|But first this is the first one so this needs a break 1st and then I'll put the other level around 3:35 to see if we can pay off that level.
NEUT11|If this one doesn't work.
NEUT12|OK so that's how I'm playing this talk.
NEUT13|I'm just trying to play quick pop up now.
NEUT14|Hope you guys like the video just with quick update notice.
