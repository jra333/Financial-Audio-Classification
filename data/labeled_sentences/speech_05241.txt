NEUT0|"""OK, people, welcome back to my YouTube channel today we're going to be talking about Netflix now as we know Netflix has just announced its earnings."
BEAR1|Now its earnings were actually below expected, but its subscribers has substantially increased.
BEAR2|That is the reason for this absolutely humongous price job of about 12% now, which is crazy.
NEUT3|Just a little bit of price action for today.
NEUT4|Literally no action at all.
NEUT5|Will I mean a bit of volatility at the start when market opened we saw a bearish set off and then this small bullish.
NEUT6|But literally just consolidation if we drew a straight line here, it would literally just be a straight line straight across price literally had no movement.
NEUT7|Now more.
NEUT8|The interesting bit is now this aftermarket post market.
BEAR9|RSR you see this this is completely overextended.
NEUT10|Over the 70 RSI.
NEUT11|Now what does this mean?
BEAR12|This means that we are due for an extremely big pullback.
BEAR13|You guys see this Magdi compared to this Magdi compared to all of this this is completely overextended.
NEUT14|So when market opens tomorrow, I expect a very big retracement or pool bag.
NEUT15|Then perhaps for some buyers to enter at this pool bag and for small, bullish trend to start happening.
NEUT16|Perhaps some consolidation here while some buyers and sellers are figuring out what to do while news outlets are broadcasting their news.
NEUT17|Apart from that, that's basically Netflix.
NEUT18|That's all I wanted to say.
NEUT19|Peace out.
BULL20|Thank you guys.
NEUT21|"If you did enjoy this very, very very short update on Netflix, please do you consider subscribing and do hidden."""
