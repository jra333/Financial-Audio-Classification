BEAR1|It has a job dropped sharply down and then managed to bounce back a little bit, but not full recovery and nearly close at 2 point percent.
NEUT2|You could check the chart in the daily chart will see here we got a dodgy pattern.
NEUT3|Actually, should be called a. Dragonfly pattern because we can see.
NEUT4|Here we got a very long long tail.
BEAR5|And long after, even though we have made a record new high, but we can see it means a very indecision and we can see this too dependent on the.
BEAR6|Top of the uptrend is very.
NEUT7|Dangerous sometimes when we gotta top out just at the doggie pattern.
NEUT8|So in my opinion here should be assigning signal very clearly selling Seattle.
NEUT9|If there's no more confirmation from.
NEUT10|The falling candles.
NEUT11|Sometimes it means the final top in mid term Even so here should be very careful as to the volume.
NEUT12|We can see the volume is high, somebody is selling, distribution has involved, so should be very careful here.
BULL13|"Thank you."""
