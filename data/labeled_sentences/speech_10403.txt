NEUT0|"""Let's get back to what matters."
NEUT1|Then the stock.
NEUT2|So my goal is that are screaming despite the Sky rocketing case.
NEUT3|Count that they let their start that they're beating Covid in a couple of months.
NEUT4|That's what this that's what this was.
BULL5|This is a I'm going higher because Cove is going to be beaten in a matter of months.
NEUT6|List alright, so I'm going to tell you why today's action makes me so confident.
NEUT7|It's not coincidental.
NEUT8|First, there's DuPont.
NEUT9|Here's a highly quality industrial at Green runs it Chemical Company.
NEUT10|It's linked to housing, autos, electronics, safety, construction, image irritation.
NEUT11|And withdrawing, of course.
BULL12|Horribly nutrition and Biosciences was doing well.
BEAR13|The biggest end markets have all been threatened are stymied by the virus.
NEUT14|That's why we've been sending saying I want you to buy DuPont hand over fist as we have for my travel trust, which you can follow along by joining the action alerts, plus.com Club and basically assumption that we're going to be seen today.
BULL15|The stock rallied 3%, signaling very strongly.
NEUT16|Science will whip.
NEUT17|Same goes for 3M.
BULL18|Steve Tusa from JP Morgan the best industrial analysts out there spoke positively this very morning about 3M, suggesting it could be turning.
BULL19|A corner I thought so too after last conference call where CEO Mike Roman talked about July looking much better than June.
NEUT20|No one paid attention and wrong, I like 3M right here.
NEUT21|Right now.
NEUT22|You are free to buy it and I have not said that in ages Disney.
BULL23|So my goal is now I told you last night that the terrific cost control saved the quarter, but that doesn't explain today's big is 9% run.
BEAR24|Now that's all about the idea that will get a vaccine because without one too much Disney's business remains in trouble with it.
NEUT25|Movies, Theme, parks, cruises, sports, it all comes back.
NEUT26|Except now you got Disney.
NEUT27|Plus driving the bus.
NEUT28|What else?
NEUT29|If you're predicting an uptick in global Commerce, I looked at two stocks as beacons, MasterCard, symbol, Ma, and Union Pacific.
NEUT30|Their stocks are fabulous barometers of economic activity.
BEAR31|With MasterCard we got some good Fintech pin action from squares great numbers, but you gotta remember MasterCard failed rally after it reported because the pandemic put the kibosh on cross border traffic.
NEUT32|The stocks moving today that says cross border traffic's coming back, travel back ends.
BEAR33|Union Pacific now weather for back to school Holidays.
NEUT34|See they shipped imports from Asia to the rest of the country to go to retailers.
BULL35|Today's rally says that scientists might be able to save the Holidays.
NEUT36|Wouldn't that be something?
NEUT37|Save the Holidays Next up.
BULL38|Apparels are huge tail Nikes putting up good points.
NEUT39|That's always a great side, but the better ones that come back in Ralph Lauren, which really wasn't all that bad when you go over the conference call yesterday.
NEUT40|Not that anybody did, and PVH which is spent ages in the covid doghouse.
NEUT41|You know, PVH is the company behind Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger.
NEUT42|You don't buy apparel if you think you're going to be stuck inside for that for six months, right?
NEUT43|I mean, if we're going to do is just look at each other inside the house, you're not going to care what you, where you, where you, where, you think he's Braves, but maybe this.
NEUT44|People going out.
NEUT45|That's what that 7% rally says to me.
NEUT46|Finally, there's three more industrialists.
NEUT47|Don't get a lot of attention 'cause they're so darn boring, but not to me.
NEUT48|There's PPG, Emerson and Nucor PPG for Cody's Emerson for Motors, Nucor for steel.
BULL49|When all three go higher, especially if there's so much carping about Emerson's allegedly weak quarter yesterday that tells you the big money's betting on return to world growth.
NEUT50|You heard at first.
