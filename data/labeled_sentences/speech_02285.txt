NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner here to talk about my favorite new feature at fool.com."
NEUT1|It's The Motley Fool, battle Royale.
NEUT2|We're doing a few of these a month.
NEUT3|We're taking 250 of the most popular stocks with you, our Motley Fool community.
NEUT4|The 250 that you find most interesting and were randomly selecting eight of them and battling them off against each other in our arena.
NEUT5|To see which one we think walks away as the most likely stock to beat the market over the next 12 months.
NEUT6|Now, why are we doing this feature and what's in it for you?
NEUT7|Well, the reason we're doing this feature is we enjoy looking across the whole business landscape, the worldwide business landscape, and finding interesting news docs and part of the discipline for the writer.
NEUT8|Guy like me is to look at companies that I've never looked at before and think which one would I pick to invest in.
NEUT9|So while the stocks themselves are interesting and the pick we hope is a winner, I think what's really in it for you as an opportunity with us to think through and get smarter about investing.
NEUT10|Why would you select that stock over that stock?
NEUT11|It's all very well to see a buy, sell, hold.
NEUT12|Segment on TV and go.
NEUT13|Oh, that person would buy or sell that, but what about when you actually have two different stocks and you have to pick which one to choose to beat the market over the next 12 months?
NEUT14|That's exactly what we do on Motley Fool Battle Royale, and in fact, to cap it off, I make myself accountable to my selection on my Cap scorecard.
BULL15|I picked that stock to outperform going forward over the next 12 months, so that's Motley Fool Battle Royale.
BULL16|"I hope you'll enjoy it full on."""
