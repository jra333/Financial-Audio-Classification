NEUT0|"""First off, I'd just like to say thank you for the subscribers and for."
NEUT1|Liking, disliking or commenting on the videos.
BULL2|It's really helping out with the YouTube algorithm.
NEUT3|Appreciate you wanting to talk about Netflix today.
NEUT4|Also.
NEUT5|Side note Monday.
BULL6|I'm definitely going to buy more workhorse calls because I still believe the price is going to go up and I only bought 4 workhorse calls for next week, but I'm definitely gonna put in maybe 400.
NEUT7|For more calls.
NEUT8|Netflix calls.
BULL9|I bought Friday because earnings is the 16th which I believe is like.
NEUT10|Well, it's definitely this coming up week, probably Friday.
BULL11|And so far the price is shot up, right?
BEAR12|Past week has been shoot.
BEAR13|That's the call my bad.
NEUT14|Yeah, shut up 40 bucks damn.
NEUT15|That's cool, as it's been shooting up, you know, and their subscribers.
NEUT16|Unfortunately, because of the pandemic, is getting really high, so I'm hoping my options.
NEUT17|Let's see what my options are, so I spent.
NEUT18|It's about 6:30 on them.
NEUT19|Yeah 6:30 'cause they cost 315.
NEUT20|I'm not really worried about Theta because.
NEUT21|See time decay.
NEUT22|Yeah, it's built about $10 a day, but I'm not really worried about that.
NEUT23|'cause the earnings are going to be on the 16th.
NEUT24|I believe.
NEUT25|The 16th.
NEUT26|Let's see.
NEUT27|Yes, scheduled July 16th.
NEUT28|I mean yeah, their quarters.
BULL29|The quarters last two quarters have been up, even though everything's been down this year, so I see I see Netflix going more.
NEUT30|I'm contemplating whether buying what the ****?
NEUT31|I'm contemplating whether buying more Netflix calls.
NEUT32|Or more workhorse calls.
BEAR33|And I don't know 'cause Netflix for sure is going to go up because of earnings that there's no way they haven't gotten more profits.
BULL34|From all the I believe they had like, yeah, Netflix shares closed 8% another record high.
NEUT35|They just they're just going higher and higher.
BEAR36|I mean, they're not losing any value, especially when it's a streaming service.
BULL37|I'ma shoot, they beat out Blockbuster.
NEUT38|You know poor Blockbuster had the first chance to do.
NEUT39|Uh Mail service, you know, and then they were like now, let's not do a streaming service.
NEUT40|Even though Netflix was doing it or they started doing, and they're like now we're good.
BEAR41|We just total potential loss anyways.
NEUT42|I just love Blockbuster going up, that's why.
NEUT43|Anyway, so so yeah, I think.
NEUT44|Ultimately, I think I'm going to stick with workhorse calls more workforce calls because Netflix is definitely going because of earnings.
NEUT45|Maybe maybe on Friday?
NEUT46|I don't know.
BEAR47|I don't know I. I feel like Netflix for sure is going to go up.
NEUT48|I don't know if it's going to drop.
BEAR49|I'm sure it always drops after earnings.
NEUT50|I assume just 'cause everyone's ******* buying and selling off, you know.
NEUT51|So I don't know.
NEUT52|I think.
NEUT53|Definitely watch Netflix this week.
BULL54|It's just been every last two quarters has been profits, so hopefully you guys get some, get some good money from these calls.
NEUT55|I'm not a financial advisor, not an expert.
NEUT56|You know I'm a ******* ******.
NEUT57|That's not a good word.
NEUT58|I'm mentally impaired.
NEUT59|Now I'm not either of those, but like, dislike the video or subscribe whatever you want.
BULL60|"Thanks for watching, I guess bye."""
