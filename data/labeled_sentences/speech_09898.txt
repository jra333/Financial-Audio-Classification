NEUT0|"""Higher the Dow is up about, it looks like 6365 points right now."
BULL1|The SNP is also up about half a percent.
BEAR2|NASDAQ is the outperformer of about 7/10 of a percent, but some of those more recovery tide reflation tide stocks are lower.
NEUT3|Taking a breather today and you can see that case in point with the Russell 2000 small caps, which is actually fractionally lower.
BEAR4|Check out shares of Neo, though those are slightly lower as well.
BULL5|After announcing secondary offering, but the stock is up nearly 50% in the last month alone.
NEUT6|Ashes over at the Telestrator with a special edition of trade school.
NEUT7|Yeah, I'm going to get a secondary offerings.
BULL8|This has been a once in a lifetime rally for the EV stocks and I think they need to strike while the iron is hot.
NEUT9|That's what's important right now, and so I think there are a few key points that's worth bringing up, the first being CFO's are better sellers of stock then you are.
NEUT10|Tesla and Nio are both sellers this week in the secondary market.
NEUT11|Meal will be raising $1.3 billion cash.
NEUT12|And they were doing that effectively in two different buckets, 650,000,000 in a convertible do 2026, and that one pays no interest whatsoever, 650,000,000 in a 2027 convertible.
NEUT13|Those nodes are paying 50 basis points, so there are effectively almost raising money for free.
NEUT14|All there is is the dilution to worry about, and those convert by the way over $93.00 a share, which is a 50% premium to where NEO is now.
NEUT15|So I think what that tells you.
NEUT16|Neo is very good at announcing new models, new cars, new products, or they as good at shipping them.
NEUT17|Not quite yet.
NEUT18|They sold about 7000 cars in December 40, 3000.
NEUT19|Cars in all of last year, so they have to build more and to do that you need cash.
NEUT20|So if you're a shareholder, don't worry about the dilution.
NEUT21|This is what you want to see happen.
BULL22|The company raised a ton of money build out capacity, do it on incredibly company friendly terms, and I think that's what separates.
NEUT23|These types of secondaires, from the ones historically where you would worry more about shareholder dilution in this case, Now you need the cash you need to make some cars.
NEUT24|Let's go to Rick in the bond market.
NEUT25|Rick Santelli is tracking the action at the CME.
NEUT26|Rick, how are you?
BULL27|Great job, great job.
NEUT28|"Of course we all want to."""
