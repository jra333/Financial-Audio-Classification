BULL0|"""I do want to get you back on vaccines though because we got this news out of Santa Fe."
NEUT1|That looks like they're going to do more trials.
NEUT2|Probably second half of next year.
BEAR3|We've already talked about vaccine supply worries on Pfizer, the allergic reactions in the UK.
NEUT4|Azar today did say that the agency is going to move fast to finalize this thing and then you had credit Frazier of Merck Jim with I would say characteristic caution on our air yesterday.
NEUT5|Take a listen.
BULL6|These vaccines have had stunning efficacy and we should all be very optimistic about where we're going in the next six months as everybody knows, is we're going to have to assist in making sure that those vaccines get to the most vulnerable populations and to health care workers.
NEUT7|After that, we can talk about a more general rollout, but that's probably going to take longer than six months.
NEUT8|So HHS today Jim says 20 million in December.
NEUT9|In terms of vaccinations, thirty million in January and fifty million February book I continue to Marvel how good things are, but I then I start wondering, is it just the RNA?
NEUT10|I mean Moderna next week we haven't talked about Moderna, could surprise us with more volume.
NEUT11|We talk about Pfizer RNA.
NEUT12|It is not like J&J to come out and say wait and see what happens where blockbuster the little more like Ken.
BULL13|But I have great hopes for JJ.
NEUT14|I did not have great hopes for Glaxo, because even though they're great vaccine companies, it was kind of a shotgun.
NEUT15|Marriage.
NEUT16|Didn't really expect anything there.
BEAR17|AstraZeneca, obviously disappointment, and this is clearly David.
NEUT18|Not an easy vaccine to make.
BULL19|But if we get J&J and they deliver, and I think they will, and that's a mid January perhaps, and we get Pfizer and we get Moderna that may be enough to be able to say we're going to get a billion.
NEUT20|Yeah, and that's a big number.
NEUT21|Yes, that's a very big number.
NEUT22|The JNJ, by the way, would only be one shot.
NEUT23|As my understanding, yes, one should double dosage needed for the M RNA, which is vaccines, which is moderna course and Pfizer.
NEUT24|Jim, it is such a strange doctors juxtaposition we have right now in terms of new highs in the stock market.
BULL25|These incredible leaps forward.
NEUT26|They were being made by IPOs or by companies that we talk about so often here EV or Snowflake or Tesla.
NEUT27|And then juxtapose with people online to get food.
NEUT28|The fact that you're not going to potentially get a relief bill out of Congress.
BEAR29|With 3000 deaths a day right, it's a strange time.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT31|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
