BEAR0|"""This just feels like mass capitulation over the last month."
NEUT1|Is that what it is for you?
NEUT2|That we've seen some of that for sure, John, you're seeing the Investor Intelligence numbers put the call ratios.
NEUT3|All these are kind of in the top desk style of observations, which usually means at some point you gotta pull back when a seasonally very strong.
NEUT4|So I don't want to overdo it, but I would not be chasing stocks here.
BEAR5|I don't see big downside, but you're right, there's been some capitulation.
NEUT6|And while we have some bright lights at the end of this tunnel regarding those vaccines, I don't think we get from here to there without a bump or two along the way.
BULL7|You share the same view as most people, though for 21, no Bob, it's gonna be a good year.
NEUT8|Many people feel that way.
NEUT9|I think I get defensive now.
NEUT10|Well, I again I'm only being short term and orientation.
NEUT11|If you've got cash on the sidelines earmarked for equities, I wouldn't go plowing all all in at all time highs.
BULL12|I'd I take my time about it, look light at the end of the tunnel, vaccines, economic reopening, improvement in earnings were probably going to be OK.
NEUT13|Absence some you know, big big downturn, but I don't think it's going to be a straight line an we've had pretty much a straight line up since the election as the absence of the blue wave is caused a lot of people to breathe, a sigh relief and put money to work.
NEUT14|But what I said about what you anticipate there's going to test the patience of this market right now, is that the data is it policy.
NEUT15|Is it the pandemic?
NEUT16|Is it execution around the vaccine rollout?
NEUT17|What do you anticipating?
NEUT18|Yes, all of that again, I don't want to fight the Fed and I want to fight the tape, but my comments are it's not as it's not a straight line look just because we have vaccine doesn't mean everybody is immunized tomorrow.
NEUT19|We could see some mutations as this thing along the way that would not be a pretty scene.
NEUT20|I mentioned this this kind of one way streets sentiment that bothers me.
NEUT21|Nobody's talked about it for a while, but valuations aren't particularly cheap.
NEUT22|You know stocks are up there in the 20s and that matters, at least over the long term.
BULL23|Valuation matters, so I earnings, you know we're going to get into confession season before long third quarter earnings were a lot better than expected.
NEUT24|Hopefully fourth quarter will be as well.
BULL25|But you know this rush to raise my GDP numbers for the fourth quarter.
BEAR26|I think it's going a little too far in the wake of some slowing and retail sales.
BEAR27|The employment numbers are going to be good, but they're not going to be great, so please don't take me.
NEUT28|I'm not a bear.
NEUT29|Don't fight the Fed.
NEUT30|Don't fight the tape, but it's not going to be slightly understand.
NEUT31|I'm not going to call you a bad Bob.
NEUT32|I know you're not a bear 2021 now.
BULL33|"It's become very, very consensus."""
