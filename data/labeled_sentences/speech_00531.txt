NEUT0|"""Yeah, let's get everybody back again with another video."
NEUT1|Today I'm talking about the Dow Jones and the future predictions of the market.
NEUT2|In my opinion, these are all just a guess and but I think it's going to happen in the market even though nobody really knows it's going to be up, down, sideways, right, or left.
NEUT3|I mean, it's not going to go left, you know, like.
NEUT4|So first I want to just talk about where we currently are at right now and what has happened.
BULL5|So the Dow Jones hit a high of 29,000 around in February.
BEAR6|Then with the coronavirus that dropped around 36%.
NEUT7|Then it's it's almost basically recovered.
BEAR8|It's gone up all their tech, 48% recovery, and now it's settled around at like 40% and today's date is June 22nd and now the Dow is currently still down 11.3%.
NEUT9|I see the selection this year, bringing a lot more uncertainties with people being very everything up in the air with Mail in ballots and all that.
BEAR10|I think the different candidates cannot be offering different things, which is going to cause the market to be a little up and down.
NEUT11|But I think the overall trend of the market up until the election in November will.
NEUT12|Probably be up.
NEUT13|And.
NEUT14|One selection begins.
BEAR15|I think that it's going to be very choppy.
NEUT16|I think it's gonna be a lot of volatility until the president is named an.
NEUT17|Once that happens, I think it's going to be down a little bit, but eventually I think the Dow is going to hit new highs and within the next couple of 2-3 years, if the next president, I think we're going to hit all time highs and just keep hitting higher highs.
BULL18|And I think the Bulls are going to prevail in this market.
NEUT19|So that's what my prediction is.
NEUT20|Please let me know what you think about my predictions and what you think will happen with the upcoming election and all the coronavirus, second waves and stuff like that.
NEUT21|I think all of these factors will contribute to more and more.
BEAR22|Market volatility, but I think if you're looking to invest in the long term, I think this is a great time to go in since the Dow still technically down 11%.
BULL23|So this is a great time to get in for the long term, and the market has neverlost ever in a 10 year span.
NEUT24|I wanted to reintroduce this topic because you can see this always in 10 year span.
BULL25|You can see that the market has been up.
NEUT26|So I think that if you're looking to invest in a long term, this is the time and.
