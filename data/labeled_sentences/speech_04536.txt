BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I would have liked to have a look at Johnson and Johnson so Johnson and Johnson does hygiene and medical supplies and they've been around for a long time so current price is $128.00 which gives them a market cap of $338 billion.
BULL2|Current dividend yield just under 3% with a payout ratio 58%, which is certainly pretty attractive.
BULL3|They've also been raising the dividend for the past 25 years, so obviously good thing their revenue currently $82 billion, which is up 6% and earnings of $15 billion, which is up 1000%, and that is fairly misleading because it's in line with the two previous gears, just not.
NEUT4|The one after that.
NEUT5|So the past year it was 15 billion, the year before that 1.3 billion and the year before that 15 the year before that.
NEUT6|16 So pretty much in line with the previous years, just not the last one.
BULL7|PE of 20 also certainly attractive, especially considering the dividend yield total assets $153 billion, slightly down total liabilities $93 billion.
BEAR8|Also slightly down and total stockholders equity effectively, even at $60 billion, which is kind of a rounding thing.
NEUT9|Just over 60 billion to just under 60 billion.
NEUT10|So no real change there.
NEUT11|So as far as risk factors go, I don't think there really are any.
NEUT12|You have to vastly outspent Johnson and Johnson to kind of encroach upon their space, and I don't think that really makes sense for any company, so I don't think there's any risk factors, and I don't think that.
NEUT13|V will cease to exist anytime soon, so I think that Johnson and Johnson is going to be fairly stable for the foreseeable future, which is, you know, 5 even 10 years out.
NEUT14|And so that means that considering the dividend yield, which is quite attractive, and the PE which is quite attractive and the revenue growth which you know 82 billion, you cannot really grow very fast at that point so.
NEUT15|I think that.
BULL16|A growth of 6% is really in line with where there should be, and so all of that combines into strong suggestion for me to look into this stock and maybe purchase it.
NEUT17|If you're at all interested in value investing or dividend investing growth investors obviously will find much better stocks elsewhere.
BULL18|But for a dividend investor, I think that the safety of the stock compared combined with the balance sheet of the stock, the attractive PE, and the fact that they've been raising their dividends for the past 25 years makes it a really attractive stock for dividend investors, and likewise for the value investors appear of 20 years.
BULL19|Amazing, not amazing.
NEUT20|It's like in line with where it should be I guess.
BULL21|But also safe company, Good Balance sheet revenue actually growing and so all of that combines into a very strong stock that I think I will be purchasing a few shares off in the near future.
NEUT22|So that will be one of the stocks I will be buying in November.
NEUT23|And.
NEUT24|That's it for me.
NEUT25|For today.
