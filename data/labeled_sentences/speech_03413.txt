NEUT0|"""He is playing this via video chart on ticker symbol FUTU."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day in this one, not only from the price action standpoint but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a weekly one.
NEUT8|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price can say up there above $125.
NEUT9|Now.
BEAR10|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that area, that does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT11|But yeah, Price couldn't manage.
NEUT12|Stay above that level.
BULL13|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Next level of support after that.
NEUT15|Would be the bottom portion of this consolidation area, which sits right there around the 119 mark, so one 25119 to the near term levels of support.
NEUT16|Taking a step back and look at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT17|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT18|The 50.
NEUT19|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there being defined as the move just watched a purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT21|He must visualize that.
NEUT22|That is what is being presented against and above 125 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|Next, key battleground going to be that pink line up there, that 200.
NEUT24|Moving average current value of that as well.
NEUT25|Just call it the one 3550 ish Mark.
NEUT26|So keep an eye on that.
NEUT27|But overall any angle you look at it.
NEUT28|Great movement today, great volume, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT31|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT36|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
