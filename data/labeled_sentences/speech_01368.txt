BEAR0|"""Beginning of anything troubling today, in terms of how far everything is coming, and it's a Monday, but it is a new year and we're coming off all time highs, but some of the leadership."
NEUT1|You know some of the biggest leaders seem to be the ones pulling back today is that?
NEUT2|Is this the beginning of something?
NEUT3|We don't.
NEUT4|We don't think so, Joe.
NEUT5|I mean as we look at the backdrop right now.
BEAR6|For equities, we think economists are still underestimating the level of GDP that we saw in the fourth quarter.
NEUT7|And we're going to see in 2021.
BEAR8|We think we're still seeing underestimation of what the power of the stimulus is doing is going to do both monetary and fiscal.
BULL9|So we think you can see some dramatic revisions upward, so that's that's.
NEUT10|Positive number one if and when that happens, we think it will.
BULL11|That tells you there's a good chance you'll see earnings revisions to hire also, and then you know there's just a strong underpinning the consumer is actually in good shape.
BULL12|We've got strong, disposable income.
BULL13|We've got tremendous savings rate $1.4 trillion in savings Joe, and we got this pent up demand that we think in the second half of the year, on top of the stimulus, both monetary and fiscal, when people are able to spend, we caught.
BULL14|We've been spending.
NEUT15|That's kind of the new term out there.
BULL16|You're going to see a big lift in the second half of the year.
NEUT17|You put all that all that together and it's a pretty good backdrop for equity we believe.
NEUT18|Let me we could spend and spend and stimulate and stimulate forever.
NEUT19|Keep it.
NEUT20|Sooner or later, it just seems like.
NEUT21|That that's not a lasting way to run in a comedy.
NEUT22|Are you a make me chase, just just not right now.
NEUT23|Kind of guy.
NEUT24|I mean this this will work for awhile at any comeuppance down the road any day of reckoning, when if rates go up or I don't know, paint the scenario that could potentially happen.
NEUT25|Yeah, no look.
BULL26|I think as part of this job we expect to see long data rates move higher.
NEUT27|We think what's going to come with this also will be inflation, which we partly why will see you know long data rates.
BULL28|We think the move to his high as one 1 1/2% by the end of this year.
BULL29|So I think initially it's going to be a very positive thing.
NEUT30|The other big driver, we think Joe will be flows.
BULL31|I mean the last two years, 94% of the flows have been into fixed income, so as rates move up we think that'll be another good catalyst.
NEUT32|But to your point, you know depending on what kind of additional stimulus we see this year, and it's pretty clear we're going to see more.
NEUT33|At what level does as inflation become a problem between here and there?
BULL34|We do think the market can lift further and the environment will stay positive.
BEAR35|Alright Keith, those are soothing words as we now are down 300 though, so we'll see.
NEUT36|Anyway thanks.
BULL37|We appreciate you there.
NEUT38|Don't come around today.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
