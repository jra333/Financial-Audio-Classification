NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Yahoo Finance senior columnist Rick Newman."
NEUT1|Rick the Wisconsin primary this things ago.
BULL2|Amazingly, yes.
NEUT3|People are voting and it.
BEAR4|I mean, it's just going to be chaotic.
NEUT5|But I mean, people are lined up for blocks apparently and their distance as they should be an wearing masks.
BEAR6|This is such a mess in Milwaukee, they've had to go from 180 polling stations originally planned to just five, so that's why people are lining up as chaotic as this is.
NEUT7|I mean, it's kind of inspiring that people are going out to vote.
NEUT8|You know, even though they know they're going to have to wait in line, they're supposed to stay home.
NEUT9|People want to vote.
NEUT10|This is the Democratic primary.
NEUT11|There's also one judge on the ballot, which is part of the thing, but this was a big battle between the governor who's the Democrat he wanted to postpone the election.
NEUT12|The Republican legislature would have had to approve that they did not approve it, so there were some.
NEUT13|They raced into court late last night in the election is on today, so it ends at 9:00 PM and they're going to be a lot of absentee ballots coming in, so I'm not sure we know by the end of tonight who actually want Rick.
NEUT14|Do you think that Wisconsin is going to be sort of the blueprint for other states to common?
NEUT15|Is is this giving us a peek at what may be?
NEUT16|The general election might look like when voting happens in November Alexis.
NEUT17|We should hope this is not a preview of the general election.
NEUT18|This is madness, but I think it is going to give election authorities in all the states an idea of how to plan for however they want to vote in November.
NEUT19|So for example if you want to, if you want most people to vote by Mail, start planning now.
NEUT20|Don't you know?
NEUT21|Make that try to make that plan 2 weeks before the election, by the way.
NEUT22|Another thing to watch for here, Joe Biden is likely to win.
BULL23|There have only been a couple of polls, but he's ahead by double digits.
BEAR24|If he does win, and it's a convincing win, that could be the thing that pushes Bernie Sanders out of the race.
NEUT25|So this is just one primary election, but it is important in a couple of different ways we're talking about here.
NEUT26|Could push Bernie Sanders out an it's a model for how not to hold your election come November.
NEUT27|Record should be noted.
NEUT28|Some controversy.
NEUT29|Controversy behind getting this primary started to begin with today.
NEUT30|Right, I mean the governor wanted to postpone this to June 9, which is what most of the other states have been able to do, is postpone, but it's not going to happen.
NEUT31|So you know, we we all kind of forgot about the Democratic primary elections.
BULL32|And at least we've got one little reminder here that the race is still on.
NEUT33|Hi Rick Newman, wearing my favorite bow tie yet of the past month, really did.
NEUT34|That's aggressive.
NEUT35|I like it washing up the Internet, Brian.
BULL36|I know, but you are definitely right man to do it.
BULL37|Rick noon thanks so much you guys.
