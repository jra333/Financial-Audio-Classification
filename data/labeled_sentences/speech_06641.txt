NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's December 21st, 2016.
NEUT2|I'm Celina Nicholas technical analyst.
NEUT3|Ericsome.com today will look at the euro versus the dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR4|So Euro USD struggling around the key 1.04 level after closing below it yesterday on Tuesday when it touched a 14 year low 1.03 fifty one.
BULL5|If we look at the momentum indicator we can see RSI has reached.
BULL6|Near oversold levels, so it's close to 30 right now, and this is signaling that the market could consolidate in the near term, and we could even see prices bounce higher from current levels so close above this key resistance level now at 1.04 could see prices correct to 1.05, and this would also be a strong resistance level, but from here prices would target 1.06 seventy and this level.
BULL7|Can be seen that it's been tested several times recently and this would also act as a strong barrier to upside moves and then a successful break above here would open the way towards another important resistance area between 1.08, fifteen, 1.09 and then move higher from here would negate the current downtrend.
BEAR8|If we look at the overall bias it remains bearish.
BEAR9|There was a bearish crossover of the 50 day moving average.
BEAR10|With the 200 day moving average, so when the shorter moving average closed crosses below the longer term moving average, this is a bearish signal and this was given on October 21st.
BEAR11|Also we can see the market is making lower highs and lower lows which is also giving it a bearish market structure.
BULL12|"Thank you so much for watching and have a great day."""
