NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Glenn this we have video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint I do own Apple from the long side in my retirement account so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
BULL5|Well, another nice day here.
NEUT6|Updates certainly need to be made first update.
NEUT7|I'm going to do is actually some house cleaning.
NEUT8|Just get rid of that line down there.
NEUT9|It served its purpose for now and from a presentation standpoint I want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT10|'cause there's lines in real life.
NEUT11|So let's try to keep this as clean as possible, but the first update that does need to make comes about based on a foundation of rule in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed.
NEUT12|Above you want to see them act as support and that's what did happen here very nicely this morning.
BEAR13|Price broke down below that level.
BEAR14|Not good and then actually got back up above it.
NEUT15|And at that point you can see that in the afternoon.
NEUT16|Right here the price pulled back bounce beautifully off there and then got the movement in the upwards direction.
NEUT17|So keep a close eye on that is going to be more so like I said, the ideal level, but it's not like if the price falls below that area that offset it implies the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT18|But yeah, I mean if the price can stay above it, that would certainly be.
NEUT19|You know, the biggest sign of power to watch, you know going forward and be a good representation that the strength in this current bounce does have quite a bit of genuine momentum behind it.
NEUT20|On the flip side of things, not really an update but confirmation being accurate term.
NEUT21|But if you watch a pass videos, I've talked about one 1275 ish being an area of resistance and you can see right there is where the price got rejected from this morning and then late afternoon last 30 minutes into it exactly but got within the divinity of it and couldn't quite push through.
NEUT22|So that's certainly going area to watch very closely.
NEUT23|But I do want to get one more area mapped out because I will not a guarantee that that area is going to be broken.
NEUT24|I'd say it's more than valid thought to have that that area you know might be getting a break out.
NEUT25|So if the one 1375 mark is broken, next key level will be right up there, around 114 thirty five.
NEUT26|But All in all.
BULL27|Another nice day for Apple.
BULL28|Let's see if the price can continue to build up on this momentum.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL33|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT40|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT42|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT43|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
