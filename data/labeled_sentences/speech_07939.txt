NEUT0|"""Scott, what is com pounding and why is it important to us as investors?"
NEUT1|Yeah, great question.
NEUT2|The best way to describe compounding is with saying that is your money makes money.
NEUT3|So there is your quote.
NEUT4|You have to have money to make money.
NEUT5|That's true to some degree but not be able to put off.
NEUT6|The reality is if you have a dollar and you were 10% return your 10.
NEUT7|If you want immersion that you want a lemon sense rather than previous $0.10, and so on and so forth, so your dollar becomes two, which becomes four, which becomes a twitch becomes 16.
NEUT8|You don't have to add any more money, you're simply relying on the returns, the money, making money, making money, making money, that kind of your building up here.
NEUT9|If you like, you're building a a constant growth into your investing and that's what company is at.
BEAR10|Its very very core is not showing 10% on the same amount.
NEUT11|If you want cash in the bank you won't 2% you in $2.00 on your 100 next year, learned on 100 next year.
NEUT12|2100 that's a flat line investment, but if you can't if you reinvest those returns or you keep those returns inside a portfolio, that's exactly how they compound.
NEUT13|Whether it's reinvesting the dividends, getting higher share prices.
NEUT14|Hopefully also adding money to the portfolio when your money making money, making money, that's the real asset of compounding.
NEUT15|That's how you go from a dollar to two, four, 816 and on from there.
BULL16|So it sounds like com pounding is even more powerful as the percentage returns increase.
NEUT17|Yeah, so you want two things time and the rate of return, and if you can maximize both of those.
NEUT18|That's where the real value is.
NEUT19|The difference between 10% compounded 12% compound is not just two percentage points or 20% difference between 12:00 and 10:00.
NEUT20|It can be multiples of your investment 'cause you're getting the 12:00 every single year, so it's actually complaining that return value and again time is of the essence, right?
NEUT21|If you can double your money every seven years, which is about the average return on stocks over the long term that the dollar becomes two, becomes four becomes 8.
NEUT22|Now if you stop there, that's as much time as you got.
NEUT23|You stop there, you can go one more compound level up to 16 that last.
NEUT24|Compound is really where most of the value is, so the rate of return maximize that where you can and maximize where you can.
NEUT25|The length of time you're compounding false start early, leave the money for as long as you possibly can get the best return you can.
NEUT26|That's the secret.
NEUT27|I think there's a really interesting fact about Warren Buffett as well.
NEUT28|After his 50th birthday, would you mind sharing that?
NEUT29|Yeah, so it depends on the number.
NEUT30|Something like at least 95% of his current wealth, current wealth.
NEUT31|Was he basically earned after his 50th birthday when he turned 50?
NEUT32|He was already worth a fortune.
BULL33|Effectively, what that said was at that point his wife was going to increase 20 fold between then and now.
NEUT34|And so that's really where the value is.
NEUT35|That's again, that same point of that the last lot of complaining you do 'cause you're compounding the same return on larger base.
NEUT36|That's where the value is.
NEUT37|And that's if you can start as early as you possibly can.
NEUT38|The best time to start would be 10 years ago, the second best time is today to get the most out of compounding.
BULL39|Excellent thanks God.
BULL40|"Thanks Ron."""
