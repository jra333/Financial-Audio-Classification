NEUT0|"""We just got the February employment report showing in addition of 379 thousand jobs last month, some insight into the markets and what may happen now we're joined by Dan Greenhaus, chief economist in strategic strategists at Solace Investment Alternative Asset Management."
BULL1|Good morning to you.
BEAR2|We just saw the jobs numbers.
NEUT3|The question I ask you is that change the dynamic at all.
NEUT4|It doesn't look like it's necessarily, I mean.
NEUT5|Where do you land?
NEUT6|You saw the number.
NEUT7|Sure, I listen, I don't think I don't think this jobs number matters at all.
BULL8|I mean, it's certainly better than expected and better than expected is better than most expected.
NEUT9|But at the end of the day, at this point is, as you know, well know everybody is looking forward.
NEUT10|Everyone's of an epidemiologist following the vaccine trends now and the and the more important issue for the economy is not necessarily this jobs report in the next one, but but the willingness on the part of consumers and businesses to quote unquote reopen three months from now, two months from now, even a month from now, that that's the driving factor for markets at this point.
NEUT11|And so here's the question.
NEUT12|I would ask you, though obviously everyone thinks we're going to have a huge reopen.
BULL13|Things are going to get so much better.
NEUT14|We had a fascinating conversation.
NEUT15|If you heard with Doctor Scott Gottlieb a little bit earlier, he said, you know what?
NEUT16|Going into November 4th quarter of 2021, he said, could get tougher again with Covid, and I'm curious whether you think the markets reflect that at all.
NEUT17|Yeah, no, I don't think so.
BEAR18|And I think, listen, I've been super bullish on.
BEAR19|On the concept that the reopening, I think internally people are sort of tired of me constantly harping on how underappreciated.
NEUT20|I think this this is because the headlines are constantly vaccine trends.
BEAR21|They're going slower than expected.
NEUT22|Europe is obviously having all sorts of issues.
BULL23|I, I think the the those headlines that come from the people like Scott Gottlieb are incredibly helpful.
NEUT24|These are obviously incredibly knowledgeable people, but they to me seem to consistently err on the side of caution and worry, and I don't think the US population is there right now.
NEUT25|Clearly behaviors are bearing that out in certain parts of the country, and increasingly in even the states.
BULL26|With larger lockdown, there seems to be.
NEUT27|I don't want to say covid fatigue, but certainly a willingness to say OK, we've got 21% of the population vaccinated.
BEAR28|It's been a year.
BEAR29|It's time to move on, and I think the constant harping on the negative outcomes has dampened for his has hidden from some people's view.
BULL30|What I think is going to be an incredibly powerful quote, unquote recovery over the next, certainly two quarters.
NEUT31|Reason why real quick, you know.
NEUT32|Most of the market owned tech for a long time.
NEUT33|That was the way to play it.
NEUT34|You want to own tech?
NEUT35|Going into this fall or not at all.
NEUT36|Well, listen, we don't so so this doesn't really do very much tech, but I think what's happening is exactly what you would think would happen.
NEUT37|These are long duration assets.
NEUT38|They're incredibly interest rate sensitive, certainly relative to the rest of the market.
BEAR39|And so if rates are going back up, which was always should have been the base case then, then these stocks were going to get hit.
NEUT40|I, I think as you as you look out over the next 6 and 12 months.
NEUT41|Leaving aside with solace, this specifically does what do you want to take into account of is how much of that rotation is sustainable?
NEUT42|And how much of it is already been priced in?
NEUT43|Which is a much longer conversation.
NEUT44|We're going to have.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
