BULL0|"""It kind of took my breath away."
BEAR1|How often you hear management say Members membership Group growth 5.2 million the same as Q2 last year lower than our Q2 four million forecast.
BEAR2|And they described that as not stellar.
BULL3|Now most companies would say we had a terrific terrific sign up.
NEUT4|They wouldn't even be knowledge that the street is looking for something.
NEUT5|This is the kind of thing that I love about Netflix, but also it's very hard to hold onto when they're saying wasn't stellar.
NEUT6|Given the fact that we're all used to world.
NEUT7|People would say we hit it out of the park.
NEUT8|This is a Bryce Harper quarter was waiting for Bryce Harper's name to be mentioned.
NEUT9|But how do you think investors?
NEUT10|Or let's say you've been out there and thinking, well this thing is it just never comes down for me to buy any.
NEUT11|I mean, is it an opportunity for those to say this is going to be a one quarter phenomenon they've just taken in their guidance for the next quarter.
NEUT12|And in fact, now they're lowballing it.
NEUT13|And here's my chance.
NEUT14|Or is it going to actually embolden those who are?
BEAR15|Scared off by the valuation overall and believe that this is the first sign of real weakness because competition is increasing overall well look.
NEUT16|I think that this is the first time I ever heard the following.
NEUT17|Maybe the total addressable market isn't that big.
NEUT18|Maybe the fifty million in the US.
NEUT19|Maybe we're all sharing and we've already saturated 320,000,000.
NEUT20|Maybe these two billion people that were thinking about that could hang on.
BULL21|Maybe they can afford this.
NEUT22|I've never heard these questions ever before.
NEUT23|All I ever heard about Whiskys limits guys limits Castle in it.
NEUT24|So the fact is that if this stock were, let's say back to where it was at the beginning of the year giant decline, I would say you know what those questions might be answered affirmatively.
NEUT25|This is really not a problem and I buy it.
NEUT26|But today is a day where someone selling it down 52's got a giant.
NEUT27|You gotta let them take their profit, but you you got to the people who were bold enough to own this stock should get the profit.
NEUT28|If they feel that they can answer the questions I just raised back to levels of less than two months ago.
NEUT29|Bernsteins notice titled the day.
NEUT30|Netflix investors have been waiting for B of A comes out and says Netflix never misses twice, and in fact if you have bespoke, went back and looked at reaction to earnings.
BEAR31|Prince Q2 is generally received the worst way we did have added just like 18 months ago.
NEUT32|Look I. I think that if this stock we're down where the answer to Davis question would be yes, but the fact is is that you are now have to take into account something that they said they didn't do well and at least roll it back a little more, but.
BULL33|Do I think it's a great company overall?
NEUT34|Yes.
NEUT35|Do I think that it's a momentum stock that's been hard to value?
NEUT36|Momentum stocks can have more than one of these.
NEUT37|They can't have more than one, so the next quarter is.
NEUT38|Yes, that's the way it will have lowered the guidance for that cracker.
NEUT39|So it may be easier to put it.
NEUT40|Yeah, it could be.
BULL41|That could be better.
NEUT42|Company is going to spend $12 billion acquiring content now we say 8 billion because that's 8 billion being spent for stuff that will air this year.
NEUT43|But they're also spending another four on things for the future.
BULL44|Well, what that number is just so stunning, but they also markedly increased margins.
NEUT45|But it's not.
NEUT46|I don't know.
NEUT47|From margin story.
BULL48|Now, I do think that their marketing budget has gone up dramatically.
NEUT49|Yes, and let's not forget they also were paying the boatload, both paying nothing for content, not to pay a boat.
NEUT50|If they still want that content knowledge when those deals run off with the established players, that's where they built themselves.
NEUT51|They built themselves on stupid media, given away prices, media stack, those points so that they know what I'm saying.
NEUT52|Steals are often when Fox Disney gets together.
BEAR53|That's going to mean they're going to pull that almost just saying, that's just gonna be even worse.
NEUT54|I mean, I get that.
