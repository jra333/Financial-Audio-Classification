BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to the notes at the beginning of what's going to be a shorter week than usual here in the US."
NEUT1|Thanks to the Thanksgiving holiday.
NEUT2|Now when it comes to giving thanks, I suppose we should be thankful that it's been a relatively quiet day with many of the trends we have become used to of late continuing.
BEAR3|So we saw a fresh low for industrial metals.
BEAR4|Now at an 11 year low, they've taken out their worst point from 2008 and we also saw fresh highs for the last six months or so for the dollar.
NEUT5|On a trade weighted basis now, perhaps the most dramatic way of illustrating what's happening to the dollars if we compare it to the Swiss franc, you'll remember there was a very dramatic day back in January when the Swiss National Bank abandoned its peg against the euro, abandoned its attempt to stop the Swiss franc, which gets a lot of safe haven flows from becoming overvalued, and you can see what happens to the dollar on that date.
BULL6|Well, it is now regained.
NEUT7|Everything it lost during that dramatic event for the foreign exchange markets.
BULL8|It's back.
NEUT9|Above parity and another very important point to make from this is that if you just look at where the year began and ended, it appears to have been really quite a dull boring market for the dollar and the Swiss franc.
NEUT10|In fact, that was far from the truth and that is true of many other markets as well.
NEUT11|If we take a look at this next chart, this shows you how the S&P 500 here in the states is done compared to the CSI 300 broad index of domestic Chinese stocks.
NEUT12|And you can see that if you just look at how they began and how the end, it all is well.
NEUT13|It's end well.
BEAR14|Both have had an extremely quiet dull years up one or two, or three percent along the way.
BEAR15|The SNP, which you can barely see when it's compared to the Chinese market, has of course had a correction of more than 10% that it's made back.
NEUT16|Ask for China.
BEAR17|There's been a bubble.
BEAR18|It's burst would have dropped some 45% if you bought at the bottom.
NEUT19|You've made more than 20% since then.
BULL20|Now that does mean that yes, there were opportunities to do very much better.
BEAR21|Then the rather flat overall figures for the for the year.
NEUT22|But what is more likely is that that turbulence that you've seen combined with the fact that the leadership of markets have said last week has become very much more narrow.
BEAR23|What is much more likely is that all that turbulence will have led many people to underperform drastically.
BEAR24|2014 was a very bad year for asset managers trying to show they could beat the market.
NEUT25|I suspect as we enter the last month of this year, that 2015 may not be much.
BULL26|"Better."""
