NEUT0|"""Hello everyone is the media."
NEUT1|Welcome to my channel.
NEUT2|Today we're going to talk about a biotech company that crashed last Friday.
NEUT3|Anne that.
NEUT4|Ark Invest actually bought.
BULL5|I think that this is a great opportunity whenever you see Ark invest taking such swift action on a company that's temporarily failing, then I think that the that they really believe in the company.
NEUT6|And that this sort of crash is just temporary.
NEUT7|So if you like this kind of content, please.
NEUT8|Comment and let me know if you're ready to invest, please consider using the two links in the description box to open an account with Weibull or Robin Hood and get free stocks so the company that we're talking about today is Sarepta Therapeutics.
NEUT9|An according to.
NEUT10|Keith, spy, author on The Motley Fool.
NEUT11|He said that.
BEAR12|The shares of Sarepta Therapeutics as RPT crashed 50.7% on front big story.
NEUT13|From the clinical update on SRP 9001.
BULL14|Is that didn't achieve a statistically significant improvement in the primary functional endpoint of an increased North Star.
NEUT15|Ambulatory assessment total score.
NEUT16|Nsaa measures the functional motor abilities of children with DMD using a 17 item scale.
BEAR17|Immediately after this news, the stock plunged by 50% because investors view the failure of SRP 9001 to achieve significant functional improvement as a show stopper for the gene therapy candidate.
BEAR18|And on Friday, a lot of analysts have decreased their ratings.
BEAR19|In fact, JP Morgan double downgraded this biotech stock.
NEUT20|However, we saw that arc invest did something that was contrary to what everyone else is saying.
NEUT21|If you can look at the chart.
NEUT22|They started a position.
NEUT23|An SRPT on the 4th of January at 388 thousand.
NEUT24|The following day, 97,000.
NEUT25|On the sticks they put in a million and then on the 7th 650,000.
BEAR26|An on Friday when it tanked, they dropped $70.3 million, buying up SGP T shares.
NEUT27|So I think.
NEUT28|That the company.
NEUT29|Ark invest.
NEUT30|Really believes in this company and that they this is just a temporary set.
NEUT31|Back is a company that does gene therapy to treat rare diseases.
NEUT32|And this is definitely something that fits into our AK Genomics ETF.
BULL33|I hope that you find the information useful.
NEUT34|"Please let me know by commenting below, thank you."""
