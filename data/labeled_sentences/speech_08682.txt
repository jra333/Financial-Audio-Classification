NEUT0|"""So a lot of people also want an opinion on MVS."
NEUT1|Mavis microvision.
NEUT2|Right here you could see exactly what's happening with this position.
BULL3|It has had a lot of growth over a number of weeks.
BEAR4|If we look at how it's grown from $1.80 all the way up to $24.00 did have a massive decrease to where it did end up having a pretty decent comeback and people thought was going to continue to go up.
NEUT5|The fact that it did come back down to the 200 DMA.
BULL6|It's not really the best situation here, but it does create buying opportunity for a lot of people.
BEAR7|So people are looking to get in at the lowest low that they could possibly get in at, but I believe it can definitely go up to $20 from what I've seen.
BULL8|It could retest a lot of these areas and get up to 20 get up to $24.00 and easily make a decent profit out of it.
NEUT9|"Or if you're holding long term, you can definitely make something really big out of this, depending how much you buy into it, but Microvision looks pretty Dang good at $14.00 an I'm probably going to get some more shares as today goes on."""
