BEAR0|"""Not enough jobs?"
BEAR1|Too many people unemployed.
NEUT2|Virus spiking vaccines not coming soon enough because even warp speed is too slow.
BULL3|That's a lot of bad news, but as Wall Street sees it, bad news is the perfect recipe for a trillion dollar stimulus bill, which is why the Dow ultimately rallied two important points today.
BEAR4|As we gain point 8%, the NASDAQ, which is been lagging in late a .7.
BULL5|Yet we saw Cogitated buying in many of the stocks, but really would benefit bye bye bye bye bye from massive injection of Federale cash.
NEUT6|For instance, Caterpillar time high.
NEUT7|The oils are wanna roll.
NEUT8|Remember I keep telling you if you want it to be in those it's Chevron or Pioneer.
NEUT9|The semiconductor stocks they just Ward, especially the ones with cell phone exposure.
BULL10|An yes Starbucks jumped 2 bucks.
NEUT11|That's become.
NEUT12|Other than Disney, which will mention a few minutes, the ultimate opening of America play.
NEUT13|But will we really get a stimulus deal?
BEAR14|I think that's the perfect place to start a game plan for next week, because if the supercharge stimulus talks don't lead to some kind of agreement over the weekend, I fear that we are going to get hammered when we come in on Monday.
NEUT15|Let's be clear.
BEAR16|The Labor Department's nonfarm payroll report this morning at 8:30 was a disappointment.
NEUT17|Although not a surprise, if you were paying attention to the spike in covid infections or the.
NEUT18|Death toll, whatever reason, the predictions for these kinds of numbers don't seem to be impacted by common sense.
BEAR19|The fact is, we're in real trouble when it comes to the virus.
BEAR20|It's circling and you have to believe a good chunk of the economy is going to get shut down.
BEAR21|It's not the government's people, it's going to be shut down by fearful individuals who don't want to get sick and are actually worried because it is a serious illness and deadly one.
BULL22|So we absolutely need stimulus deal.
NEUT23|I mean, I love a big one, but even a smaller compromise bill would work if it acts like targeted business interruption insurance for the small and medium sized businesses that are now dropping like flies today, the President's chief economic Adviser, my old partner Larry Kudlow, outline on Squawk on the street.
NEUT24|Exactly what kind of plan he said it was what Trump wants to.
NEUT25|But the White House is never actually been the bottleneck here.
NEUT26|You should realize that the chief obstacle is Senator said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and he's still not on board.
NEUT27|I hope today is not so hot data convinces him to change his mind, but it's possible the data doesn't matter because he doesn't seem very data driven.
NEUT28|All that said, this market is an uncanny ability to divorce itself from the horrors of the present moment.
NEUT29|Instead, Wall Street focused on the battlefield profits that were likely to see from tech, from housing and from auto companies when various variations of them report next week.
NEUT30|If the numbers are good.
BULL31|This market could have more upside even with some more bad news about the virus.
