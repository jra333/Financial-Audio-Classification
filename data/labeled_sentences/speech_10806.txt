NEUT0|"""Well first one I've got to tell you, I've been thinking a lot about your company because all of your work and all your documents make it clear it is a technology company that helps mobility."
NEUT1|It's a mobility tech company.
NEUT2|Why are people having such a hard time realizing that you are not the old car parts assembler of our different era?
NEUT3|I could have summarized it better.
NEUT4|Jim.
NEUT5|I think Magna is I like to call it a $40 billion startup with a 60 year history and we're really getting started because we are an industry that is really high tech and complex and has an addressable market of three trillion.
NEUT6|An going going forward.
NEUT7|Still, as we look at the product portfolio it's really broad, but we have a market leadership position in most of the products that were present in the uniqueness of Magna, really.
NEUT8|Is besides the system knowledge we have in all the product we engineer and manufacture full vehicles?
NEUT9|That's the uniqueness and with the mobility changing to service and all the disruptions that we are happening that are happening in the industry, I think we're just getting started.
NEUT10|OK Swami, let me ask this in a kind of funny way.
NEUT11|A lot of people say when you have a party you can't have enough ice.
NEUT12|You have too much ice.
NEUT13|You literally have so much internal combustible engine.
NEUT14|I think it actually camouflages all you're doing.
NEUT15|With these new technologies.
NEUT16|I am glad you asked the question, Jim.
NEUT17|We can clarify that a little bit.
NEUT18|We're actually agnostic to propulsion system.
NEUT19|Think of a car.
NEUT20|Doesn't matter whether you have ice or hydrogen or TV or anything else, you still need to have a body and chassis and lights and actuators and seats and so on and so forth.
BULL21|70 to 80% of our company is that product and you know what we have market leadership position in most of those products we generate really good cash.
NEUT22|If you look at the last three years.
NEUT23|The results speak for themselves, right?
BULL24|We generated about $5.8 billion in cash, invested about four billion back into the business, and this is what sets us up to be able to invest into the future.
NEUT25|And if you've seen the next three years, we continue the performance in a similar way.
BULL26|So I think this actually helps us to lay the foundation and lean forward, and EVs and autonomous and mobility as a service.
NEUT27|So we're really ice ignostic Don't miss a second of mad money.
