NEUT2|Where to invest your money?
NEUT3|Berkshire Hathaway, also known as Warren Buffett's company.
NEUT4|Is a holding company for over 60 companies.
BULL5|We've had a phenomenal 2017 These guys are headquartered in.
NEUT6|And in Omaha NE.
NEUT7|Let's get to the charts and see how they did in 2017.
BULL8|It has finally hit Class B.
BULL9|Shares have hit $201.00.
NEUT10|We just phenomenal and if you would have invested like.
NEUT11|Last year by this time.
NEUT12|Last year if you would have invested like 100 shares for 16,344.
NEUT13|It would have been like 20,000 and 42 giving you around.
NEUT14|$3700.
NEUT15|I invested in last April.
NEUT16|Federal Authority shares are 166.
NEUT17|And I've made around $34.
BULL18|They've been really going up.
BULL19|Of course, the whole market is going up and it's not a surprise that Berkshire Hathaway is going up, and most of the S&P 500 indices are going up and one of the major contributors to that is Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL20|Also, given the current fiscal policy's low interest rates, Berkshire Hathaway has been going up, and it has done really well.
BULL21|Over the last one year, which is 2017, close to 18 to 20% returns again.
BEAR22|I really think there's been a major opportunity to buy during the hurricane season around 11:17 due to their reinsurance time due to the heat taken by their the insurance companies where Berkshire Hathaway holds stakes.
NEUT23|However, it has for over the last one year it has given a written of over close to.
NEUT24|18 to 20%.
NEUT25|Use your discretion and look for a decent pullback if you want to start a position.
BULL26|"Thank you."""
