BEAR0|"""They shut down may have some marginal effect."
NEUT1|I'm still with you.
NEUT2|It's probably more weather and seasonal issues of Steve knows he wrote the piece.
NEUT3|I think couple years ago, highlighting the fact that government can't seem to get Q1 correct an now, with weather supposedly going to be super cold in the Midwest where there's a lot of transportation distribution lanes for manufacturing that weather cold, that's probably a bigger factor than the government shutdown.
NEUT4|Personally, that's exactly what I was going to say.
NEUT5|So so you actually think the bigger risk to a weak first quarter GDP, the bigger risk is the cold snap.
NEUT6|Is the cold snap and the seasonality the fact the government can't seem to get the data?
NEUT7|Accurate because you typically get a big rebound in Q, but my point is right now they're not getting the data out at all, right?
NEUT8|So we didn't have the retail sales.
NEUT9|We didn't have durable goods, you know, a lot of it.
NEUT10|We've had to rely on the manufacturing surveys or people say, what are your plans?
NEUT11|How do you feel about things that are as opposed to getting the hard data?
NEUT12|Yet this is true, but I tend to like the software data more just because the hard data, while it looks good when you go back and look at the figures.
NEUT13|Gotta keep in mind Kelly, these numbers are revised.
NEUT14|You could drive a truck through the 1st and final estimate of GDP.
NEUT15|So sentiment to me is important in sentiment is what response to markets.
NEUT16|And I would argue markets now are more important in driving monetary policy.
NEUT17|They've ever been before.
NEUT18|What about the old was at Paul Samuelson, the line that markets have called the nine of the last five recessions.
BULL19|So yes, there are probably one of the best real time indicators in economists.
BULL20|They're probably even better than economists are not perfect.
NEUT21|Now.
BEAR22|I'm not sure that's right that they're better than economists, but I also disagree with you a little bit on the issue of the data.
NEUT23|Which is.
NEUT24|He's right that the data is revised, but if you think about that, it means not only do we have to wait longer for the first print, now we've got to wait longer for the revision.
NEUT25|Which means that you're you know, I guess, the definition of flying blind here in a lot of different ways, especially at a critical turning point.
NEUT26|I don't know Joe, there's been any studies that show the soft data does a better job than the hard data in not only telling us what's going to happen, but even telling us what's happening right now.
NEUT27|Yeah, I mean, I think it's all issues altogether, although absolutely, but I just I just know I'm working with data.
BEAR28|I find that a lot of series are lagging to coincident.
NEUT29|They're not forward looking.
BULL30|And the reason I think sentiment is just more important is that QE and forward guidance have worked through asset.
NEUT31|Price channels Anwen asset markets move whether it's credit or equities that tends to impact sentiment and therefore sentiment argue becomes effectively leading indicator.
NEUT32|You also brought it sort of data point.
NEUT33|We can look at when we're talking about why might this slowdown be happening and with the Fed meeting coming up this week.
NEUT34|You know how much more should they be tightening is pausing the right thing to do here?
BEAR35|Well, yes, we're still low.
BEAR36|I mean, the interest rates are low historically speaking, but if you look at this chart, would suggest we've actually had more tightening overall than in any of the last three or four, really.
NEUT37|Going back to the Volcker date right now.
NEUT38|So, just to be clear on this chart, this shows the shadow rate, so the Wuji had a shadow rate.
NEUT39|They used effectively back during the early Q ears and said that rates affectively were bout minus 300 basis points.
NEUT40|So that's how you get half percent.
NEUT41|That's how you get such a large cumulative increase.
NEUT42|And I'm not saying this is exactly the right way to look at monetary policy, but it does suggest perhaps one channel by which the Fed has tightened more than what many people believe you some factor for the balance sheet reduction, no?
NEUT43|So I added.
NEUT44|So what we did a balance sheet calculation, then found Steve the balance sheet maybe was worth an extra 50 basis points.
NEUT45|"Having said that, the weakness in housing and autos I would say is broadly consistent with this sort of narrative."""
