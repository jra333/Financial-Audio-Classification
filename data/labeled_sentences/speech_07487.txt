NEUT0|"""Welcome back, it's the 30th of September, 2020 Wednesday, the day after week we are at #28V chain with the ticker vet."
NEUT1|What's up Sonny Liew?
BULL2|So for Vechain against BTC we've been knocking on the support for a very, very long time.
NEUT3|How we've been here since September, so you could see that potentially we're forming a head and shoulders right on top of the support left shoulder right shoulder.
NEUT4|Problem we collect slower.
BEAR5|Find envy chain drops lower and lower.
BEAR6|Oh no, this is not good.
BEAR7|This is absolutely not good, but some things are just not looking good for reaching at this point of time.
BEAR8|Are we going to drop lower?
NEUT9|I don't know.
BULL10|We already quite well results on the stochastic.
BEAR11|The decline has been under the meat line for some time, however, since crossing it way back around August here, so we've been down for about.
NEUT12|I mean, more than a month already there.
BEAR13|We have been down and down and down your vision.
BULL14|If you were with us way back in July, there was a very good trade.
BULL15|You know we had a very, very good shape for Vechain.
NEUT16|We put out the sell price and so we hit our sell price to sell level.
NEUT17|We were close to the top when we sold it so.
NEUT18|Congratulations everyone who did it again.
NEUT19|Congratulations, we put it out to put out a call for the price and there you go.
NEUT20|Anyway, after doing so, much vision is taking a break in my only question is, are we going to be breaking the skinny pink line yes or no?
NEUT21|I I can't tell, I really can't tell how I feel like we are testing, you know, we've been testing the support so many times.
BEAR22|Hey shoulders yeah, feels me like things could be dropping lower unless of course huge green volume comes in to push the price higher.
NEUT23|Otherwise I think we're going to roll over for Vijay.
BEAR24|If you look at the past Vechain kept dropping.
BEAR25|There was a rally and it just kept dropping right?
BEAR26|We read it but I'm in trouble again.
BEAR27|Again we read it and then we drop are going to drop lower.
NEUT28|I don't know.
BEAR29|I can't say but things are not looking good.
NEUT30|Absolutely you're not looking good for reaching at this point of time, so be very, very careful about going to a trade.
NEUT31|Too soon, all right.
NEUT32|Yeah, we're going to check out the chain against USD T. Please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT33|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about the chain in the comments below for Vechain against USD T. So we mentioned last week that there was a bear flag we broke out of the Bear Flag and we are down from the bear flag, right?
NEUT34|The bear flag, yeah?
BEAR35|So we were anticipating into drop to this noisy area over here.
NEUT36|Right now we're still hovering on top of the.
BULL37|Support, you know, we've been on the support for very long time.
BEAR38|If we form a double mountain triple mountain, you know this could be a descending triangle and we could be dropping much lower for vision against USD.
NEUT39|So things are just not looking good for Vechain absolutely not at this point of time.
BULL40|Yeah, if anything I'll be bias bearish.
BEAR41|Here it was the downside anyway.
NEUT42|We completed a proper reversal chart pattern over here in the form of a head and shoulders.
NEUT43|We dropped the former Bear flight and we're dropping.
BEAR44|We're going to drop any further.
NEUT45|It all depends upon BTC.
BEAR46|BTC continues dropping more likely than not Vechain is going to drop as well, so be very, very careful about going to a trade too soon.
BEAR47|I feel like, uh, there's still more downside to come for Vechain, but of course I could be wrong.
NEUT48|Huge green volume could just suddenly come in and we could just suddenly start spiking.
NEUT49|Right, but until that happens, we will remain patient and we will wait for the Vechain wills to do their thing.
NEUT50|Alright, so yeah, I guess from my vision technical analysis.
BULL51|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL52|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT53|"I shall see you in the next video."""
