NEUT0|"""Age play and this will be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from a price action standpoint, you look down there at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT8|Going forward.
NEUT9|That would be if the price can now stay up here above.
NEUT10|The 126 market don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 126.
BEAR11|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL12|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT17|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT18|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT19|As long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT20|As line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control of visualize that.
NEUT21|That is what has been represented insurance and above 126 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT22|Let's squeeze down the charter, 'cause as you're seeing it's been quite awhile since the price of an up this high.
NEUT23|So not getting enough to go that far back, but next key level of resistance.
NEUT24|Now watch moving forward.
NEUT25|Going to be right up there at the $130 mark.
NEUT26|So 130 Public Enemy number, one moving forward for Apple, but All in all, any angle you look at it.
BULL27|Huge volume today.
BULL28|Very impressive.
NEUT29|Price movement.
NEUT30|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT31|Let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT34|But it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL36|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
