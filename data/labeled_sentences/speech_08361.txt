NEUT0|"""Is 9:00 AM."
NEUT1|So will be looking more, but loads a little bit little bit easier, little softer, little little little books.
NEUT2|I've never been to Lowe's, only been at Home Depot.
NEUT3|Yes, of course.
NEUT4|One of those big things around.
NEUT5|Let's talk Amex, though 'cause this is a fascinating American Express they've been falling behind for a while, is playing catch up with Visa and MasterCard.
NEUT6|A new Journal report says the card company is offering sign on bonuses to businesses who begin accepting its cards and the amounts range from 10,000 to about $450,000 as of last year.
BULL7|Visa and MasterCard were accepted in about 1.3 million more US locations than Amex internal sales targets.
BULL8|To sign up, new merchants have increased.
BULL9|At a double digit pace since 2016, incentives for businesses include discounted swipe fees.
NEUT10|One of the biggest concerns are small and medium retailers.
NEUT11|The Journal report says sign on bonuses with no strings attached are nearly unheard of in the credit card business, Visa and MasterCard sometimes pay businesses to start accepting their cards, but usually to defray the costs of payment, technology upgrades, and in some I don't know if you read through the story, there were anecdotes in which it would take American Express.
NEUT12|Something on the order of 6 to 7 years to make back.
NEUT13|The payments that they were offering to the merchants, the incentive payments, so they would offer somebody $10,000, but in some cases the amount of money that they can collect off the 3%.
NEUT14|There's such a small amount that they that to get to $10,000 in terms of fees is remarkable, so it's gonna be interesting as you as you start to look through their earnings reports and things like that to understand both their marketing costs.
NEUT15|Now I think they've actually taken some of the marketing spend down and have moved some marketing spend money into this program, just like a soft line in there.
NEUT16|"Turning for it well, so we'll have to see how what it is exactly."""
