NEUT0|"""This is a case where you rip the band aid off, and by the way, you know the President talked about shared sacrifice."
NEUT1|OK.
NEUT2|The only shared sacrifices going on right now is the healthcare community.
NEUT3|OK, the nurses, the doctors, the people taking care of patients?
BULL4|OK, those people are making enormous sacrifices.
NEUT5|What would the president be asking the American people to do?
NEUT6|He's not saying, you know.
NEUT7|It's not saying to storm the beaches at Normandy, right?
NEUT8|He's saying go home.
NEUT9|Go home.
NEUT10|Spend a month with your family.
BEAR11|OK, and I know for some families that's a hardship.
NEUT12|OK, but it's nothing.
NEUT13|Go home, take a deep breath.
NEUT14|To spend time with loved ones, take care of your children.
NEUT15|OK, don't worry, no landlord is going to collect rent.
NEUT16|You know from anyone who can't afford to pay it.
NEUT17|You know the government is going to step in and fund.
NEUT18|You know, you know, send you money so you can buy food.
NEUT19|We keep the supermarkets open.
NEUT20|We keep the drug stores open.
NEUT21|We keep the hospitals open.
NEUT22|We keep our National Defense working.
NEUT23|And yes, we have to shut the borders.
NEUT24|OK and then 30 days later the virus is gone.
NEUT25|In America largely gone in America and then we have to be careful.
NEUT26|OK, for the next 12 to 18 months until we have a vaccine.
NEUT27|And by careful I mean we have to practice social distancing.
NEUT28|We don't shake hands, we don't.
NEUT29|Hug and kiss.
NEUT30|We were we wear masks and we test like crazy.
NEUT31|OK we need a test where in five minutes you can tell whether you have the virus and you know think about the flu reason why the flu is not so dangerous and not nearly as scary because when people get sick they stay home.
NEUT32|And by staying home they don't pass it on to people.
NEUT33|What's happening here is you have a 20 year old.
NEUT34|If you look at the beaches in Fort Lauderdale.
BEAR35|Unfortunately a week ago right there, packed with 18 to 22 year olds having the time of their lives spreading the virus.
BULL36|OK, and they're probably OK, most of them, the vast majority of them.
NEUT37|But when they go home to their parents or they go home to their loved one or their friend who just had breast cancer surgery, and you know, in his immune compromised, they're going to kill that person.
NEUT38|OK, and once you once you have the thought experiment, OK that you know everyone feels you know 99% chance I'll be OK, OK, but it's not you.
NEUT39|It's the person you give it to and the paradigm I had I said, look, I am not going to kill my father.
NEUT40|And so, and so I I shut.
BEAR41|I went into lockdown.
BEAR42|I went to lockdown almost a month ago.
NEUT43|OK, to save my father's life I.
NEUT44|Don't you understand that we have to?
NEUT45|We gotta save everyone's life.
NEUT46|"OK, and then I know this is a business television show, OK, But the other way we save lives is by saving the economy."""
