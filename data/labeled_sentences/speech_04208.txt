BULL0|"""China stock markets are finally opening up to international investors for the first time."
NEUT1|MCI has included mainland listed stocks in its flagship Emerging Markets index that makes it impossible for investors to ignore the world's second largest economy.
BEAR2|The allocation is tiny, less than 1% of the total index, but that number is only going to rise.
NEUT3|The opportunities are huge, but there are some big concerns.
NEUT4|Passive investors will have no choice but to hold Mainland listed Chinese stocks.
NEUT5|Along with Chinese stocks listed elsewhere, investors will eventually have more than 40% of their Holdings in China.
NEUT6|That's hardly the diversified exposure investors in a global index are looking for.
BEAR7|Many Chinese companies have huge debt piles relative to their earnings.
BEAR8|That makes issuing new shares more likely, which in turn dilutes returns for investors.
NEUT9|Nearly 70% of main unlisted companies have a single shareholder that owns more than 1/4 of the stock.
BEAR10|"A dominant shareholder can ride roughshod over the concerns of retail investors who may find themselves without a say over the direction of the company."""
