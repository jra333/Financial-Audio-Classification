NEUT0|"""Speaking of Berkshire Hathaway and Buffett, our next question comes from Evandro, who's in Sao Paulo, Brazil?"
NEUT1|Wow, what will happen to Berkshire Hathaway stock the day Buffett announces his retirement?
NEUT2|He's 88, so it's possible it could happen soon.
NEUT3|I have no issues with him continuing to lead the company, but for natural reasons we tend to think about his eventual retirement.
NEUT4|It would be great to hear what you think.
NEUT5|Yeah, that's a great question.
NEUT6|I was at the Berkshire meeting this May and you know, it's just amazing when you see it.
NEUT7|You mentioned Warren Buffett up there at 88 and taking questions for six hours from.
NEUT8|You know 40,000 people, or 50,000 whatever was there, and you know Charlie Munger, his sidekick, and Vice Chairman's 94.
NEUT9|Still mentally sharp, right?
NEUT10|Let me just like, yeah, amazingly sharp and still eats about a box or two of peanut brittle and drinks cherry Coke the whole time so so much for your doctor's orders of eating healthy and longevity.
NEUT11|But the great thing about Berkshire?
NEUT12|I've owned it for a long time.
NEUT13|This question.
NEUT14|I remember reading this on our discussion boards in the 1990s the late 90s.
NEUT15|You know, Buffett, 70, some years old, you know now we're getting it.
NEUT16|20 years in the past.
NEUT17|So here's what I would say.
NEUT18|I would be surprised if Berkshire stock went up when Warren Buffett stepped down, right?
BEAR19|So it's probably going to go down.
NEUT20|But then again, this is his baby.
NEUT21|He's built this thing.
NEUT22|There are some things that are very unique about Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL23|First of all, they have a wonderful bench strength of managers and they have a decentralized organizational structure.
NEUT24|So although they own 80 plus businesses, they're all run by their own entrepreneurs and great people.
NEUT25|And Buffett has no real insight into those businesses.
NEUT26|He understands what's going on.
NEUT27|He gets the numbers, but.
NEUT28|They run those day-to-day.
NEUT29|He does not.
NEUT30|All he really does is capital allocation an management so the capital allocation stuff he's hired a couple of really good folks to do that.
NEUT31|Todd Combs and Ted Weschler helping out on that, and he's got some great people on any insurance opposition operations with the Jain and Gregg Abel will take over some of the other operations for their manager oversight and the management duties of Berkshire.
NEUT32|So he has great people there.
NEUT33|And my guess is, if you're anticipating that the stocks going to get crushed that's probably not going to happen.
NEUT34|They have lots of capital, and I'm sure that the people are taking over the reins from Warren will have free reign to buy back stock.
NEUT35|It will if it reaches a certain price.
NEUT36|So if you're expecting that I'm waiting for that day, it's probably not going to come from the day will come when he will step aside, but the price probably won't be on sale as much as you think, so I wouldn't worry so much about that.
BEAR37|I've also owned it for several years, but now I'm sure not as long as you, but I don't like you.
NEUT38|I don't have the same concerns.
BULL39|I mean, Buffett has shown an ability to invest in good businesses.
BULL40|And he is also shown ability to invest in good people, and those people will still be there after he retired.
NEUT41|Yeah, yeah yeah.
NEUT42|And they have 100 billion in cash.
BEAR43|It's hard.
NEUT44|There's not many companies on the on the Earth that have the balance sheet strength at Berkshire Hathaway has right now.
BULL45|And we know that they're willing to allocate it very quickly.
NEUT46|I think he bought almost over 40 billion of Apple in the last few years or so, so he'll put it to work when he finds ideas.
NEUT47|Another example of how you could possibly own more Apple than you think?
BULL48|Yes, we work through.
NEUT49|"That's right, yeah."""
