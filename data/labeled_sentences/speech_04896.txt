NEUT0|"""Checking on money matters."
BEAR1|Facebook is having one of its worst quarters since going public and Nike's new ad may be backfiring.
NEUT2|Jane King joins us live now from the NASDAQ.
NEUT3|With those stories and more in this morning's Money Matters report.
BULL4|Hey, good morning to you Jane.
BULL5|Happy Friday to you.
BEAR6|So the Nike ad featuring Colin Kaepernick got a lot of buzz, but it may be hurting Nike's reputation.
NEUT7|We talked a little bit about stocks yesterday.
BEAR8|There's this new poll that suggests that Nike's reputation is taking a beating over the Colin Kaepernick ad.
NEUT9|Now the polling company Morning Consult found.
BEAR10|That net favorability of Nike had dropped by 34 points since before the ads release, and here's the key part.
BEAR11|Favorability dropped among those surveyed who are Nikes core demographic Jens Ears and also millennials.
NEUT12|So some people think that's why they did this.
NEUT13|They thought those generations would be more accepting of it, but apparently they're not liking it either.
NEUT14|So time will tell.
BEAR15|People aren't liking Facebook.
BEAR16|Facebook shares have fallen 16% in the past three months.
BEAR17|Yeah, in fact, the worst quarterly performance since 2012 and other social media companies writer pressure as well.
NEUT18|Washington looking to possibly start.
NEUT19|Regulating them, so that's what's driving the stock price down.
BEAR20|Twitter is down as well.
BEAR21|Now SNAP shares fell below $10 for the first time.
BEAR22|The parent of Snapchat is lost.
NEUT23|3,000,000 daily active users.
BEAR24|So a job report is expected to be released later today.
NEUT25|What are we expecting?
BEAR26|Little less than an hour will get those numbers, so the August typically a sleepy month for job growth, so we don't have huge expectations.
BEAR27|The range of guesses in terms of how many jobs added last month between 170 and 195 thousand, and we do believe the unemployment rate probably stay below 4%, will find out soon enough.
NEUT28|And another choice for people who like to go on a big boat for vacation.
NEUT29|Carnival cruise lines.
NEUT30|New system lets you choose when to debark.
NEUT31|That's right.
NEUT32|Previously you had to leave the ship in zone so this new system will come in handy for people who maybe have an early flight, they need to catch and they need a loan number to get up.
NEUT33|Ship sooner so that new system will have no impact on passengers though who choose to self assist and when they debark since they carry off all their luggage on their own.
BULL34|Hi Jane, have a good weekend.
BULL35|"Thank you."""
