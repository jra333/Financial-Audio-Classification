NEUT0|"""Since the 1960s and 70s, the young guy is getting dressed."
NEUT1|He wants to wear clothes not because he has to.
NEUT2|He wants to, well, every piece on the runway is made in America.
NEUT3|Today.
NEUT4|Every piece, every piece, which is fantastic.
NEUT5|Our bags are codes are suits for hats, footwear, Allen Edmonds and I worked together on a collaboration with winnable.
NEUT6|But there's a distinction.
NEUT7|It's not just waving the flag about being made in America, it's being made well in America and where as good as the rest of the world.
BULL8|We have a factory in Massachusetts, we have 800 artisans, so we're so proud of that.
BULL9|So wonderful experience to have those 800 people working on global collections.
NEUT10|So you could say we can make quality apparel in America.
NEUT11|That's right, and we can stand up to the to the global design community and say, look, what we can do in America.
NEUT12|And I hope this show represents that.
NEUT13|Does it also mean jobs in America?
BULL14|Of course, it always means jobs, and we're so proud to be one of the largest employers.
NEUT15|And southeastern Massachusetts and that factory.
NEUT16|Those people are so proud of what's going on today because they say I made that lapel.
BULL17|I made that shoulder, but those are competitive advantage we can get to market quicker.
NEUT18|We can make small runs and I'm interacted with the factory on a daily basis.
NEUT19|The mood is sort of this rugged dandyism we took.
NEUT20|We've taken all of these really handsome guys and put them in clothes that have some mystery, some romance, but we didn't play the boys game.
NEUT21|We played the manscape we wanted these guys to be rugged and beautiful and mysterious.
NEUT22|So that's always what I wanted the collection to be about.
NEUT23|The guys that this millennial market wants to get dressed and they're hungry for information about Savile Row and custom tailoring.
NEUT24|And we're here to give it to him.
NEUT25|Any colors that you can talk about well, the colors of the collection or just about colors we start with and I always say it's man color and we never do pretty colors.
NEUT26|We use strong colors so you're going to see a very interesting cool to warm and then we'll close with black and white for evening.
NEUT27|The stress happened when I was designing and making the collection.
NEUT28|Now it's the quiet before the storm.
BULL29|We've done great clothes.
BULL30|"We've got great models and it's up to the audience."""
