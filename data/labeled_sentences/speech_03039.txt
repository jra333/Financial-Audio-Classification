NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel.
BULL2|We're finally starting to see life in Facebook stock.
BEAR3|I've held onto this stock for over a year and it's one of my not the worst performer, but out of the fangs it's kind of in the middle.
NEUT4|It hasn't been moving for the past six months.
NEUT5|An will start in finally starting to see something happen with the stock now.
NEUT6|Earnings has not happened recently.
NEUT7|In fact, there's nothing in the news to tell you a reason why Facebook is moving upward, but it is.
NEUT8|Right, so this is one of the strange things that I talked about yesterday with stocks finally waking up where people are looking and saying something's going on here.
NEUT9|So this is what this article basically says.
NEUT10|It picks out the big names an the ones.
NEUT11|Of course that have not moved yet.
NEUT12|An you know, kind of gives light to them again.
NEUT13|So now let's go over to Robin Hood and kind of see what's happening in a technical sense.
BULL14|So I think we're up to 290.
NEUT15|Which we haven't seen in awhile in Facebook.
NEUT16|Let's try to see.
NEUT17|Yeah, we haven't seen 290.
NEUT18|In awhile I think we did hit 300 so since last August right again, nothing in the news.
NEUT19|This is all this not pertaining to the stock, you know, increasing like it is right now, but it's something that's happening for no reason, so this happens rarely in my opinion.
NEUT20|I usually don't see it as much, but when it does happen I guess you just be grateful for it.
NEUT21|Not saying that it's going to, you know it's not going to go down.
NEUT22|It probably will.
NEUT23|But because you know the stock is such a good stock, in my opinion they're the leader in the Oculus goggles, which is going to give you a virtual reality in your goggles, and they're trying to create their own cryptocurrency, and there the leader in advertisement them in Google.
NEUT24|It's a great company to buy and people have been sleeping on it for the last six or seven months.
NEUT25|As I stated before, if we were to compare Facebook to the other text in the market.
NEUT26|Majority is in the green besides Tesla, but Facebook is soaring up at 4% right while the other ones are not even 1%, so there's a reason for that and.
NEUT27|It's just a reason that we don't know.
NEUT28|I think it's just we were sleeping on the stock and now it's starting to wake up.
NEUT29|That's about it, so I'm not sure if right now is a great place to buy this stock.
NEUT30|But if you've already bought it and held it for a long time then definitely continue to hold.
NEUT31|There's no reason to sell your shares, as you can see I have an average cost of this much down here.
NEUT32|I don't plan to sell at all, just probably just keep it here for very, very long time.
NEUT33|"So hope you like and subscribe and I'll see you in the next video."""
