NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the Gold Weekly chart and you can see just in the last few moments we've broken through 1550."
BULL1|As I wrote, the article looks to me like gold is done so we are going to continue to rush towards the US dollar.
NEUT2|This probably has more to do with margin calls in other markets.
NEUT3|Funds will have to.
NEUT4|Liquidate profitable positions to cover.
BEAR5|Those massive losses that they're getting other places.
NEUT6|There's also no sign whatsoever of inflation, so gold's done.
NEUT7|"I would not be surprised to see a rally to about midway up the candle stick and then to roll over, but at this point I think 1500 gets targeted then 1450."""
