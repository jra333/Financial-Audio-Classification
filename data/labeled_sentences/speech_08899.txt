NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Even not sure what I mean by a 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, I'm in the state, the obvious, but I want anyways.
BULL5|Very impressive movement on Apple.
NEUT6|I mean you saw, but think about the fact of where it closed on.
BEAR7|Wednesday and then where it was able to fight back today.
BULL8|Good solid move.
BULL9|Now granted the last 30 minutes here was pretty rough, but still relatively speaking, even from where it closed to where it was down here.
NEUT10|That was a good solid move, but with the craziness here that does still bring about the more than valid question of.
NEUT11|But is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT12|Is there any sort of genuine strength, or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT13|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT14|But by using charge we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind at all levels on a single area.
BEAR15|In that area is down here at 113.
NEUT16|Why is 113 important?
NEUT17|And I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation saying if the price were to come down to 113, behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT18|Well, that would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out of it.
NEUT19|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price moves like go back to where they were not exactly Santa true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT20|But to be fair, no pricing go straight up.
NEUT21|So maybe the price does come down here, behaved in that manner.
NEUT22|Then start to work the way back upwards.
NEUT23|Now of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there.
NEUT24|You have these loads down there if you envision each one of those, as there are steps, well, hey now you have stair steps making progress in the upwards direction.
NEUT25|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT26|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL27|It's going to make progress forward and in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 113 now as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT28|Key level to watch moving forward.
NEUT29|Initially going to be right up here at.
NEUT30|The 117 mark.
NEUT31|You can see the last several times the price went up around this general area.
NEUT32|It's just presented problems including today, but if the price can push up through the 1:17 next key level would be that pink outline right there.
NEUT33|Which is that 200.
BULL34|Moving average valued right up there around the one 1775 mark, but All in all nice bounce today.
NEUT35|Let's see if the price can build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT36|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT38|But it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL40|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT42|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR43|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT44|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT45|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
