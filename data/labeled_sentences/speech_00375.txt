NEUT0|"""It's claimed this would be a video chart on ticker symbol SANP."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Will a very, very impressive way to start off the week here.
NEUT5|So definitely updates need to be done so much.
NEUT6|I'm just going to delete these lines out.
BEAR7|Yeah those levels still pretending that they're just not relevant anymore and from a presentation standpoint was causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT8|'cause there's lines are very long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible on the newest areas of support and what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT9|We say you know what?
NEUT10|Make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
NEUT11|And that would be the price could say above .018.
NEUT12|Now don't get me wrong if the price falls below .18.
BULL13|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage to stay up above that area.
BULL14|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT15|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT16|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT19|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauge in the health of the move.
NEUT20|That right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT21|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT22|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what is being presented against and about .18 would be great.
NEUT24|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, but bulls 100% owned the sharp as far as areas of resistance don't matter.
NEUT25|As I've said in past videos and will continue to say what matters the most is what the price has already been doing and continues to do.
NEUT26|And that's that right there.
NEUT27|Just build those higher bases.
NEUT28|Or if you want envision those is there step so in other words, along the stair steps, continue to construct themselves in the upward direction.
NEUT29|Then, given enough time everything else.
NEUT30|Once you take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
BULL31|So focus on healthy consolidations.
NEUT32|Focus on chipping away and build our bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT33|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL36|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT41|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT45|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note.
NEUT46|Is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT47|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT48|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
