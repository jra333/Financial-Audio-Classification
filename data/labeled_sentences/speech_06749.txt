NEUT0|"""Hello again everyone, this is Joe Henches with beyond the chart and this is a an educational video."
NEUT1|We're going to take a look at Facebook and kind of walk through an analysis of Facebook here.
NEUT2|Today is July 23rd, 2014 so the data that we have here is through end of day yesterday 22nd.
NEUT3|It's going to be interesting after today's after the market closes today, Facebook will be out with its earnings now.
NEUT4|What I think is going on Facebook is, I think it's had five ways of this.
NEUT5|Is this entire trading since it started trading back in 2012.
BULL6|So from this very very low here in September 2012, we've had 12345 waves up.
NEUT7|Many of us thought that this was a top right here in January.
NEUT8|Or actually late December 2013.
BEAR9|And we thought this was the end of the 5th wave, which very short 5th wave.
NEUT10|And actually it ended up pushing developing longer and pushing up into here.
NEUT11|So I really do believe this is five ways which would mean this is impulse wave one.
NEUT12|OK so let's.
NEUT13|So when you look at impulse wave one, let's see how far it's corrected already.
NEUT14|Let's look at a retracement of this.
BEAR15|It's getting hard to get it up there.
BULL16|It's going to be close.
NEUT17|Let's close enough.
NEUT18|It really hasn't even retrace 38% of the move.
NEUT19|OK, so it's still very shallow.
NEUT20|Correction this is not normal for a for a wave.
NEUT21|Two primary wave two.
NEUT22|This was a primary wave 10 really.
NEUT23|Right now I am expecting This is why I'm expecting that this will be a.
NEUT24|We've got a wave one coming down and then we got wave two and I think we're going to have a wave 3.
NEUT25|That'll pull back a little bit deeper.
NEUT26|That's what I'm looking for now.
NEUT27|Let's let me blow this up real quick.
BULL28|I think coming down out of here we had a wave.
NEUT29|One shall little wave two pullback.
NEUT30|I think with this wave three, and then this developed into a triangular sideways wave, four usually triangles are in the 4th wave, and then we had this five fifth wave down.
NEUT31|If that's the play, that means we had five waves.
NEUT32|For a whenever you have five waves down for a in the first wave down correction that means it's a zigzag and therefore this should not go back up to the top of here.
BEAR33|So I could be a little wrong on this.
NEUT34|It's not totally clear, but this looks kind of shallow to me and so I'm thinking that's why I've gotta?
NEUT35|By Bay.
NEUT36|I'm thinking this is be in that we're going to turn around and come back down through so it will be looking to see does it break this little shallow trendline?
NEUT37|And then does it break this trend line and then down?
NEUT38|Here is the 233 day moving average so all the moving averages are aligned positively.
NEUT39|Right now you got the 55 which is this dark line here and the 55 is above the 233.
NEUT40|The 20 ones above the 55, those are all simple moving averages and then I've got my 10 exponential above the 21, so they're all aligned right now that ends kind of a trigger line, and so we'll have to see it hasn't broken down yet.
NEUT41|We'll see if it continues to push higher or whether it turns and breaks down, and does one more leg to the downside.
NEUT42|Alright?
NEUT43|That's my best assessment of Facebook at the moment.
