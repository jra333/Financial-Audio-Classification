BULL0|"""Apple has been fairly predictable with technical analysis indicators."
BULL1|We have a very solid support line and hit three times solidly.
BEAR2|There is a slight breach here, but that's OK. One little breach is OK, but we've had three right on the money touches and even recently a balance.
BULL3|I got into this trade right here and had a good run.
BULL4|I've had a good solid nearly 6 /, 6% runup.
NEUT5|I could have sold.
NEUT6|My goal is to get 5% on each trade.
NEUT7|I could've should've would've.
NEUT8|Could've should've woulda sold but since I have a trailing stop loss I was guaranteed no loss.
BULL9|Now it did go up.
BULL10|It also came right back down and it passed through my stop loss, but I still ended up with a 1% gain.
NEUT11|Now it's not great, it's 1/5 of what my goal is, but hey, I didn't lose money and my trailing stop loss did its job.
NEUT12|I generally.
BEAR13|Suggest setting a stop loss 1 to 2% below support the day I bought it.
BEAR14|That ended up being a little over 5% stop loss.
NEUT15|Another way to look at it is instead of creating a trailing stop loss you could create.
BEAR16|A static stop loss at 1 to 2% below your support.
NEUT17|Now the problem with that is as it goes up.
BEAR18|If it gets you know six or seven percent 8% above support or maybe 8 or 10% above your stop loss if it comes down quickly and breaches through that you could lose quite a bit.
BEAR19|You could lose 8 or 10% as opposed to.
NEUT20|Setting a trailing stop loss is going to follow you up now.
NEUT21|The problem with the trailing stop losses you can get whipsawed out like I did, but it also does this job and it protects you from losses.
NEUT22|Possibly a combination is the sweet spot, so maybe when you first get in here as you start getting up to your goal, in which case mine is 5%.
NEUT23|Once I get to my 5% goal, I change my static stop loss which is 1 to 2% below the support.
NEUT24|I change it to a trailing stop loss that is still one 2% below.
NEUT25|Support but now.
BULL26|As the price continues to go up.
BEAR27|The trailing stop loss rises.
NEUT28|And.
NEUT29|If it gets beyond your.
NEUT30|Entry point now you're guaranteed a profit, so two ways to look at it.
NEUT31|Both are valid.
NEUT32|If I had set a static stop loss in this situation, I would still be in Apple.
BULL33|Apple is making a move back towards that support.
NEUT34|Will it hit that support?
BULL35|Will it reach that support?
NEUT36|I do not know.
NEUT37|That's why we have to use a stop loss to protect us, but then the question is, is that a trailing stop loss or a static stop loss?
NEUT38|That's for you to decide, and each trader must think about what.
BULL39|Their upsides and downsides, and what how much money they can afford to lose if the worst scenario occurs, I'm likely to get back into Apple because I have a lot of confidence that it's going to bounce.
NEUT40|It may not even bounce.
BULL41|It may just continue the uptrend from where it is, but at the very least it would bounce an continued uptrend, and there's quite a bit of upside.
BULL42|There's at least another 15% of upside, and that's way within my goal of making a 5%.
NEUT43|Profit on each trade.
NEUT44|Anyway, if you have questions, feel free to put them below.
