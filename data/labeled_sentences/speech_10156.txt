NEUT0|"""It's time for word on the street where we check in with our panels, find out what they are watching."
BEAR1|Not a great day for stocks overall today.
NEUT2|But how about some IPOs?
BULL3|Gerard is watching that Jerrod things have picked up a little bit in terms of IPO's.
NEUT4|Which ones are we seeing today?
BULL5|Today we got Relay Therapeutics Antrian insurance group so looking at the Wi-Fi interactive Relay got a nice 75% pop.
BULL6|Really incredible.
NEUT7|The IP owed at $20 per share raising 400,000,000 in total.
NEUT8|And we've seen a lot of these big pops.
BEAR9|I'll just bring up this one to Encino down 2% today, but over the last several days I think it rallied 200% in its first day.
NEUT10|And just another example of the strength of the IPO market.
NEUT11|So here's tree, an insurance group it IP owed at 15, and I believe I believe it opened up at 17, so it's settled back down to about its IPO price.
NEUT12|There it is right now, but just to give you a bigger picture, look of the IPO market.
NEUT13|We have the Renaissance IPO ETF an year to date.
BULL14|It's up 36%.
BULL15|And off these lows much more.
NEUT16|About 50%.
NEUT17|Just kind of indicative of some of the risk taking that's in the market, and I think that's going to be correlated with overall stock performance, especially the NASDAQ for some time.
NEUT18|Just speculation, but it is a good time to be IP owing right now, at least in the short term.
NEUT19|Quick quick follow-up question for you before we move on to Dan, do we have any indication that the so called Robin Hood traders are part of what is fueling the rally in the IPOs?
NEUT20|Specifically with respect to IPOs, I would say not necessarily.
NEUT21|They are very much interested in a lot of these stocks, but there are some really interesting dynamics on how they have affected certain individual stocks, so I would say it's possible.
NEUT22|But are they adding to the overall indicies?
NEUT23|Probably not, you take.
NEUT24|A picture you take a stock like hurts for example, and they did have a big part in that run up so individually.
NEUT25|Yes, indicies, no.
