BEAR2|It's Wednesday, October 10th on Christina Bethany investment analysts and today we will be looking at the euro versus the British pound as the budget conflict between Italy and the EU, as well as rising hopes for a Brexit deal pressure significantly the market over the past two weeks.
NEUT3|So now zooming into the day trial considered Europe pound continues to print red candles for the sixth consecutive day.
BEAR4|Reaching an almost four month low of Zero Point 8722 today.
BEAR5|Moreover, the price has increased further distance below the chymical cloud and it's moving average is a sign that the trend is likely to remain on the downside in the short term.
BEAR6|Momentum indicators down here support that rebound is possible as their sin the stochastics are located in oversold territory.
BEAR7|The RSI has already dropped below 30 while looking at the stochastics.
NEUT8|The Green Percentage K line is set to cross above the Red Percentage D line below 20.
NEUT9|Still downside corrections cannot be excluded either.
BEAR10|Given that the Mac D continues to strengthen to the downside in negative zone an below its red signal line.
NEUT11|In this case we could look for support between zero point 87 and 8668 where the price created bottom several times in the past.
NEUT12|However, it would be more interesting to see whether bearish actions can break a wall.
BEAR13|Around Zero Point 8619, the lowest level reach since May 2017 because such a move may activate stronger negative corrections, turning their market bearish in the longer term picture as well, I believe it happens at the next level to watch could be around zero point 8577.
NEUT14|Now the other hand, if the price manages to bounces, the bounce up immediate resistance could be found between Zero Point 8716 Zero point 88 frequently approached area over the past 12 months, slightly higher zero point 8840 where the 200 day moving average is currently located should be in focus as well as this is a previous support and resistance area, while if this fails to stop upside movements, then the price may try to overcome it speaks.
NEUT15|As your point 8927 on January and Zero Point 8967 on March.
NEUT16|I finally looking at the medium term picture.
NEUT17|The market is trading neutral from mid June onwards.
BEAR18|If the price was to rally about Zero Point 1997, the outlook will turn bullish while a drop below 0.787 would paint a bearish picture.
NEUT19|So that's all from me.
BULL20|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
