NEUT0|"""Yeah, my name is Michael Johnson, a native omahan."
NEUT1|However, my family are Americans living abroad and are on Saudi Arabia.
NEUT2|My question is related to intrinsic value and Ben Graham security analysis.
NEUT3|I read a book earlier this year by Janet Lowe who said that you were.
NEUT4|More.
NEUT5|Tored the first or second editions of security analysis and not so much tored the 4th.
NEUT6|Yet the 4th addition seemed to move more toward growth and value, being kind of joined at the hip.
NEUT7|Like you said in your last few annual reports.
NEUT8|And so if I'm a person that's always studying security analysis like I do, I think I spend more time at that.
NEUT9|Do you?
NEUT10|Think I'm I need to get those first editions or is a 4th edition kind of more what you've moved toward with your comments, such as value and growth, are joined at the hip.
NEUT11|Janet Lowe is here, incidentally, today she wrote a very good book on men gram.
NEUT12|I recommend that any of you that haven't read it go out and buy a copy, the.
NEUT13|I still prefer the.
NEUT14|I think the 2nd 2nd edition is cheaper to buy than the 1st edition by some margin and I think it's basically the same.
NEUT15|Books, so I that's the one I would recommend.
NEUT16|It isn't because of differences on value and growth.
NEUT17|I just I just think that the.
BULL18|The reasoning is better and more consistent throughout.
NEUT19|The second addition, which is really the last one that that that then was the 100% along with Dave Dad helping him in various ways, was responsible for writing, and so I think that the book has gotten away.
NEUT20|To quite an extent from both grams thinking an from his way of expressing himself.
NEUT21|So I but I have no quarrel with anybody wants to read later editions at all.
NEUT22|I do think probably the 2nd edition if you.
NEUT23|If you're a real student of security analysis and you read and understand.
NEUT24|That you know you should do all right.
NEUT25|In terms of a lot of the mistakes that were made in terms of junk bonds and accounting and all of that sort of thing.
NEUT26|Recovered in 1934.
NEUT27|In that first edition and subsequently in 1940.
NEUT28|In the second edition.
NEUT29|But there's a lot of.
NEUT30|There's a lot of meat in there.
NEUT31|Later on I.
NEUT32|You know, I, I must admit I didn't read the last edition's.
NEUT33|As carefully as the earlier ones, but it struck me, it was.
NEUT34|At the.
NEUT35|What was said was not as.
NEUT36|Is not as important and it wasn't said as well.
NEUT37|And it was more expensive.
NEUT38|"Charlie, any thoughts on that?"""
