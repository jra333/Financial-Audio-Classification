NEUT0|"""Also guys, it's your boy will back on the video today."
NEUT1|I will be talking about Microvision stock ticker symbol, NVIS stock, so Microvision stock.
NEUT2|I will give you some prediction.
NEUT3|As an analyst I see going forward.
NEUT4|Also give you some key levels.
NEUT5|Will drop together to look for some buying OK.
NEUT6|I am now interested in the stock.
NEUT7|It didn't let me zoom out.
NEUT8|So it did have what day was that?
NEUT9|So it did have the run up around December and had the previous run up.
NEUT10|I'll go out further so you guys can see.
NEUT11|OK.
BEAR12|So it did have this run up over here.
NEUT13|This run out.
BEAR14|But I wasn't looking at the stock and then it pulled down.
BULL15|I would have got in this area right here around $5 'cause I like getting in on pullbacks and I would have held and that would have been a very decent profit.
BEAR16|But now it is pulling up again.
BULL17|So as you guys know on the pull up's when it's trending and nice, that pulled back to be a healthy trend.
NEUT18|So now we are waiting for that pull back and I'll give you guys some key level to look forward to.
NEUT19|So miss you guys like the video that's described by the internal post notifications so you don't miss any updates.
NEUT20|And now let's look at some levels.
NEUT21|So the first level I see.
NEUT22|Is at 974.
NEUT23|Watch this level when price comes back down.
BEAR24|'cause price has to come back down.
NEUT25|It won't stay up forever.
NEUT26|Watch that level.
NEUT27|I think this will be a key level.
BULL28|It did come up and came closer right here and saw some bind but it didn't touch it so I'm waiting for it to touch this level and I think that would be a good buying opportunity.
NEUT29|But if it does fall through that level, then this is the second level we will look for at 848.
NEUT30|I think that would be a key level, so these two levels are very key.
NEUT31|This level right here will be a more opportune level that I would like to buy off of.
NEUT32|And if it did come down here, I would probably get more shares than I would right here, right?
NEUT33|So I would have like a set amount.
NEUT34|Say I want to put $1000.
NEUT35|I'll probably put like 30% right here, just in case it goes up.
NEUT36|I don't miss it, but if it goes right here and it starts coming down, I'll put the rest of the 70% right here, right?
NEUT37|So only 30 right here.
NEUT38|If it goes up, I'll just profit on the 30 but 30.
NEUT39|If it comes down, I'll put the 70.
NEUT40|OK, I will allow it to go a little below, but if it goes, price goes below $7.00.
NEUT41|Then I just won't be playing the stock.
NEUT42|It needs to really stay above $8.00.
NEUT43|I'll say above 750 to still be bullish, OK?
NEUT44|But this level is where you really want to see some buying off of you want to see some reaction, but we will see how that goes on Monday.
NEUT45|It is turning up so it needs that pull back down.
NEUT46|Don't get in at these high prices.
NEUT47|Always wait for it to come back down.
NEUT48|'cause what goes up must come down.
NEUT49|So I had these two levels on your chart.
NEUT50|This one is 974 and this one is 874.
NEUT51|OK reminder, I'll put 30% here 70% here and I'll be waiting for the run up to go above $12.00.
NEUT52|Thirteen dollars.
NEUT53|OK, that's why I'm playing this talk.
