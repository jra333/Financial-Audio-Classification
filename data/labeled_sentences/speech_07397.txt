NEUT13|This is video 5 of 19 to watch from the beginning click on the link in the description below.
NEUT14|First and foremost, I want to point out ozone is not making money.
NEUT15|We have a price target from analyst on this upgrade of 64 Yahoo Price target is 56 currently trading at 50.
NEUT16|8 Now Russia, Russian, Yandex and ozone are two Russian companies.

NEUT21|This is kind of a big one.
BULL22|And with the most recent upgrade up to 64, taking a look at the stock, this stock is new to our market came out recently in November 2020 has created somewhat of a support level here.
NEUT23|At about 50 bucks a share.
NEUT24|If it was to pull back I would look for a buy right around 54 to $52 a share.
NEUT25|With a price target, I agree at 64 this is a good one.
