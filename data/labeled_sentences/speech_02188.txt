NEUT0|"""Certainly, don't expect to see the Fed cut rates when they meet on March 18th."
NEUT1|They're going to see how things play out if this blows over.
NEUT2|If the economic impact is limited than the I think the Fed can get away without cutting rates, but it depends on what happens in the data over the next month or two.
NEUT3|You know Billy, who's it milk and now he was at at City for a long time.
NEUT4|Had I thought a great idea that he mentioned just last hour which is there is something the Fed can do.
NEUT5|They can offer regulatory forbearance to small businesses.
NEUT6|In the case of defaults or business disruption during this.
NEUT7|Why not use a tool like that instead of?
NEUT8|This constant commentary about rate cuts.
NEUT9|Well, I think the Fed is going to be looking at all of their options.
BEAR10|You know, we've seen long term rates decline, so that's providing some easing.
NEUT11|the Fed can certainly look at things that it can do from a regulatory front to provide relief to banks into small businesses.
NEUT12|They need to consider all of their options, but certainly rate cuts are the primary weapon in the Fed's toolkit.
NEUT13|And if the Fed feels that it's necessary, then will see them later this year.
NEUT14|As of now, I just don't see that happening yet.
NEUT15|So Gus, how does the global economy of void?
NEUT16|Certainly the areas of in Europe?
NEUT17|That may be right on the cusp of recession?
NEUT18|Or some of the areas in Asia like Japan that are very close to it as well?
NEUT19|How do they avoid tipping into recession if the world's second largest economy flatlines for at least the first quarter and maybe well into the second?
BULL20|It's going to be difficult, and obviously we've already seen very aggressive monetary policy from the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank.
NEUT21|It's it's unclear how they can be much more aggressive than they have been.
BULL22|They may require fiscal stimulus, although that takes some time to ramp up.
BEAR23|It may be inevitable that we do see mild recessions in those countries.
NEUT24|The question is, is it going to hit the USI think the US fundamentals look pretty good.
BULL25|Consumers are in good shape.
BEAR26|The labor market is in good shape, so I think even if we see a mild recession overseas, that doesn't necessarily imply a recession here in.
BEAR27|United States, but it might imply a slowdown here in the United States.
NEUT28|Would you go that far?
NEUT29|Or not necessarily?
NEUT30|Absolutely.
BEAR31|I think we will see noticeably slower growth in the first half of this year.
BEAR32|We already have the hit from Boeing ending production, at least temporarily.
BEAR33|The 737 Max that's going to be a drag.
BULL34|I think the coronavirus will be a drag through the first half of this year, but I think given the solid fundamentals, I do expect that the US economy will avoid a recession.
BEAR35|Although we will see slower growth and slower job growth associated with that.
BULL36|Alright guys, thanks for your time today.
BULL37|"Guess Foshay, we appreciate it."""
