BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This video chart on ticker symbol IDXG.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT6|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT7|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance to summarize today's price movement from just a trading jargon standpoint, this is what I would call a gap in trap.
NEUT8|What do I mean by gap in trap?
NEUT9|Well, on Tuesday the price closed right there and then this morning the price opened up there.
NEUT10|What is known as a gap up and in this situation a very big gap up.
NEUT11|Now this is where things got beneficial for those people that understand how to trade because the price after the gap up.
NEUT12|Went up and up and up and up, but then for the people that don't really know how to trade or thought they knew how to trade, there is a whole bunch of poor souls buying all the way up in this area of the chart.
NEUT13|How do I know that a bunch of people were buying?
BEAR14|Look at the biggest volume bar was on that Spike where the price got up around there and then from that point it's basically been all selling pressure.
NEUT15|The rest of the day, so there's no doubt about it.
BULL16|A lot of people are currently underwater on the position on this one, so I hope it bounces back up for their sake so that they can learn a very valuable lesson and.
NEUT17|Maybe not having it cost them money, but pointer being that's the overall context.
NEUT18|That gap in trap and that moving forward here, the level that I would definitely call me offer up a little more context.
NEUT19|A definitely a muscle during high level.
NEUT20|Is down here at 3:50 Wise 350 important?
NEUT21|I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just from an explanation saying if the price were to come to 3:50 and then continue on down, what would you have?
NEUT22|Well, at that point you would quite literally have the price right back inside this big old range that the price just broke out of today and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT23|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sound true power, true strength.
NEUT24|So that is why at least bare minimum going forward.
BULL25|The price just needs to at least they over 350 'cause at least if that's the case, then that represents the price still has the potential to show some signs of progress.
NEUT26|So we'll see what happens with moving forward.
BEAR27|But yeah, right now things are looking pretty shaky.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL32|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up.
