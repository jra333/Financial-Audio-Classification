BULL0|"""Good morning everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to live trading action by in the money stocks.
NEUT2|My name is Nick Santiago.
NEUT3|Today is April 6 2015.
NEUT4|Stock.
BEAR5|I'm going to show you right now is JetBlue Airways and all the airline stocks due to the higher oil price today are coming under pressure.
BULL6|But this is 1 stock that has been remarkably strong.
NEUT7|Stock is still trading right near its twenty day.
NEUT8|Moving average is not even tested.
NEUT9|Its 50 day moving average in quite some time, so if it does pull back, this is one that you want to get involved with level I'm looking at right now for this.
NEUT10|Stock is around 1705.
BULL11|You're going to see a nice daily chart gap.
NEUT12|Fill right around that level.
NEUT13|Let's just draw the line in there.
NEUT14|This way everybody could get a good glimpse of exactly what we're looking at.
BULL15|So right at seventeen 1705, this is where JetBlue should have very, very good institutional chart support for a couple reasons.
NEUT16|One, you have the gap and then you could see this long base here where the stock broke out and then re tested before it broke out to new highs.
NEUT17|That's always a good good level markets always like to come back into their breakout points, and this would be the level I'm looking at for JetBlue.
NEUT18|At this point in time, so keep the stock on the radar right around seventeen 1705.
BULL19|You're going to see this is a very, very good level.
NEUT20|Also, what I like to do very, very often is go to the weekly chart and see what the pattern is looking like there and you can see that this is just a mild gradual pullback and you could see the 20 moving average is sneaking up on the weekly chart right into that $17.00 area.
NEUT21|So 17 in my opinion, should be a very very good level to get long JetBlue, should we get a pull back into that area now you come over, take a 7 day free trial to our Research Center.
