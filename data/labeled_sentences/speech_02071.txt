BULL0|"""Early gains the cool pedal is coming to us from the NASDAQ."
NEUT1|Let's head over to an exchange in Chicago at the SIBO is Alan Nachman, chief market strategist at Aghora Financial.
BEAR2|Alan Koch has been having a little bit of a rough start to 2019.
NEUT3|Tell me what you're looking at, right?
NEUT4|While we can see the macro market, March continues, so it's about finding value and value can be found.
NEUT5|I think it's some of these distressed Dow stocks coax a great example.
BEAR6|Coax down 3% year to date.
BULL7|The Dow itself is still up 10% even with this little pullback.
BEAR8|With the Boeing pressure.
NEUT9|Now this is a stock that's traded between 44 and 47.
BEAR10|After that gap down with that earnings news.
NEUT11|So a break out of this sideways range we've been in for month targets 50 and then we're right back to the highs once again.
BEAR12|OK, so it's relative underperformance to basically everything its own.
NEUT13|Benchmark, the Dow.
NEUT14|The S&P 500.
NEUT15|Some of the companies with its own space.
NEUT16|Alan, I know you're mostly a technical guy.
NEUT17|I mean the story that we've discussed here for Coke and Pepsi, of course is they've been needing to find other avenues for growth even as Staples.
BULL18|But Pepsi's doing a little bit better.
NEUT19|I mean pepsis upon the year.
NEUT20|I mean, are you looking at possible type of parent situations is just pure Coca Cola getting exposure?
NEUT21|I think it's just a pure cold plates, a very conservative play.
NEUT22|If you look at the action and Coke for many years, you know it's been sideways to slow drift higher.
BULL23|Yes, we made multi year highs here.
NEUT24|You know not so long ago, but I think it's really about a value place about finding good risk to reward an at these levels.
BEAR25|It's very hard now.
NEUT26|We've been talking many weeks.
NEUT27|I've been talking, you know, more aggressive plays, aggressive plays.
BULL28|Microsoft just made new highs.
NEUT29|So Intel you know what's a breakout?
NEUT30|So I think this is a more pragmatic strategy.
BEAR31|After a 20% bounce off the market.
BULL32|If you look at the Dow, if you have a full V recovery in this Dow from 29,000 dollar 22,000 that targets 32,000 thirty 2000, so that's 25% were above where we are right now.
NEUT33|So let's talk about the math about this play because it's much about the trade as it is the underlying stock.
NEUT34|OK, and I'm going to give us more perspective here as you go through trade Allen because this is looking at your bullish on Coke in the short term, right?
NEUT35|This goes out to June.
NEUT36|I'm not again just to look at the pier.
BULL37|Pepsi is upon the year and actually spread between the two is really at the peak level.
NEUT38|It's been over the past two years, so some might say it needs to come in a little bit, so there's some more perspective.
NEUT39|Or I go ahead, give us the rundown on what you're doing.
NEUT40|So we're looking for a little bit more catch up in this in this place, so to speak, but it's not only a June option is June of 2020, it's in organizing the $40 calls, so this is an option.
NEUT41|That's now, you know, almost $6 in the money.
NEUT42|It's it costs $7.00, so I was looking at it.
NEUT43|Why buy a June option that only has three months a June of 2020 has one year and three months, and it only cost $100 more.
NEUT44|So why not buy extra time even though you don't, you may not need it, but you got more time to be right.
BULL45|It's going to behave very well.
NEUT46|Like I said, it's deep in the money, so it's got a Delta about 80%.
NEUT47|It's going to act like the underlying stock.
NEUT48|An if this market is, I don't think it's enough.
BULL49|I think it's more of a win when this market gets back up to those highs, we're in a strong bull market until proven otherwise.
NEUT50|Then this option, which costs about $700.00.
NEUT51|Right now it would be worth 11, so that would be a 50% gain without a whole lot of mental risk.
NEUT52|I don't think I'm not going to lose sleep over a Coca Cola position over the next year and three months.
NEUT53|Good stuff, I like it interesting.
NEUT54|Look at a company here and put him back on our radar for appreciated.
NEUT55|I'll Nachman coming to us from the seabaugh.
NEUT56|Thank you, right?
NEUT57|You got it.
NEUT58|Mr Nachman's, chief market strategist at Aghora financial.
NEUT59|Next, let's talk ETF's exchange traded products in more.
NEUT60|"We'll be right back with more Stars Pro on the subject."""
