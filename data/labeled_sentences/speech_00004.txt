NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see from this daily chart."
NEUT1|We can see it formed a small red Dodge.
NEUT2|It means there's no large change during day and it's still within the range of last green Dodge.
BEAR3|So if we check the volume the volume is smaller than yesterday.
NEUT4|It means there's no Marcel know much buying.
NEUT5|If we check the picture here, we can see actually Apple has been a narrow range for several days and from here it's an average is roughly from the.
NEUT6|15th of nine at 615th of September.
NEUT7|2 here.
BULL8|So it's roughly modern one month, so it's still a healthy sign for the Apple stock.
BEAR9|So if the as long as the volume kept going down, it means that consolidation, not distribution.
NEUT10|So in my opinion, is not.
NEUT11|It's unlikely for the Apple stock to form a double top, because here is 1 top someone said here will be another top, but in my opinion is not likely because the volume.
NEUT12|The volume is not so large, so it means it means there's no more further down from here.
BEAR13|It's very likely for Apple stock to go ahead from here after consolidation in meter, but in shorter may can see the momentum is still weak, so I'm thinking short term Apple stock will still need some time to gain the momentum.
BULL14|It will consolidate during this range, so it's a magnifier to here so.
NEUT15|Actually, it's the lower end is this discount and higher net discount.
BULL16|"Thank you so much."""
