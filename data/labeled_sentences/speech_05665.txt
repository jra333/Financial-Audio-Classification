NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
BULL1|I'm liking stocked up in this video.
BEAR2|I will be going over Qcom put spreads and also the Iron Condor from a couple days ago so we can see that QCOM fell almost 11% today.
BEAR3|This is horrible, horrible news because we have an Iron Condor on it, but they fell because of trade talks.
NEUT4|And when you're selling an Iron Condor, you literally want the stock to do nothing.
BEAR5|You want to stay pretty much the same and QCOM did exactly the opposite of that, so it's bad for our in Condor position.
NEUT6|But do not panic on it because it's only one zip right?
NEUT7|We still have all of Thursday in all of Friday for qcom to bounce back, so don't worry bout it now.
NEUT8|And even if you were selling put spreads on it and they're in the money, don't worry bout it.
NEUT9|There's still a good chance that QCOM could bounce back, so don't panic, let the trade play out where I'm going to be emphasizing on in this video, though, is a put spread, but not just.
NEUT10|Selling put spreads like we usually do.
NEUT11|But also buying them so we can see that Q comes at $69.31 right now.
NEUT12|We're going to be looking at 7371 put spreads.
NEUT13|What this means is you would sell the 73 put and then buy the 71 put.
NEUT14|So I'm going to plot it on my chart right now by right clicking the 73, put clicking more info and then going through thinkorswim charts and then boom.
NEUT15|Now it's on my chart.
NEUT16|Then I'm going to subtract these 71 put.
NEUT17|We could see what we see in the chart right now is a visual representation of the 7371 Q.
NEUT18|Come put spread the lowest this could go is 0.
NEUT19|Unlike regular options, the spreads have a limit, so the lowest this could go is zero.
NEUT20|In the highest it could go is 2.
BEAR21|Alright, ignore the Wick, it's just it's a charting error from thinkorswim, but.
BULL22|The Logo 0 high as it goes to right now it's very close to that to level right out of 184.
NEUT23|So now is a great opportunity to sell this spread.
NEUT24|You would get so the Max loss is 200 if you sold it you would get $184.
NEUT25|Is a credit alright?
BEAR26|That would deduct from the $200 Max Max loss that would leave you with a total risk of $16.00.
NEUT27|And a total reward of $184 on this, right?
NEUT28|So that's insane.
NEUT29|That's how you could have.
NEUT30|That's how you can play this right now.
NEUT31|But if you looked at it yesterday, like if you would have instead of sold this thread yesterday, if you would have bought it yesterday, you could've bought this bread and wouldn't be a credit spread you you could have bought the debit spread of this for $7.00 yesterday and today at $7.00 is worth $184.
NEUT32|So I know I just talked about two completely different things.
NEUT33|But Long story short, you could always buy in sell spreads just like options, just like stocks.
NEUT34|You could have bought this yesterday for seven and sold it for 184.
NEUT35|Now you could sell it for 184 and then hopefully by it when it falls down to like a dollar.
NEUT36|So you can make $183 profit.
NEUT37|You wouldn't even have to buy it when it falls back down to a dollar, but you know you just let it expire worthless and then you could make the Max profit.
BEAR38|So obviously the current iron on the current Iron Condor position is not good right now.
NEUT39|But Long story short, don't panic.
NEUT40|You know it's not, it's still.
BULL41|Rate rate in QCOM can definitely bounce back, but there's more opportunities to sell put spreads if you want to.
NEUT42|If you have any questions on this video, let me know in the comments down below.
