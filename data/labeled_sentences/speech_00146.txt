NEUT0|"""All right, it's time for unusual activity."
NEUT1|Pete tell us what you got.
NEUT2|I'm going to start off with some AMD Scott and this is the name that's hit so many different times.
NEUT3|I can't even tell you the month of November, probably about 15 different bullish hits, four in the last week, two today as a matter fact today what they're doing is a very aggressively 4300 of the December 98 calls.
NEUT4|Stock was trading around $88.00 at the time they were buying them 98 calls in December for about a dollar and a quarter.
NEUT5|So that was pretty interesting to me.
NEUT6|They also were buying a one week out option as well.
BULL7|So very, very active in AMD expecting some upside.
NEUT8|This is a stock that at 74 just a month ago jumped all the way up to where it is now, now betting on the fact that basically running up towards $100 a share.
NEUT9|So that was pretty interesting.
NEUT10|Now I've got gap stores for you.
BEAR11|Some pretty aggressive buying going out in time, a little bit, which is unusual, but if you take a look at this chart this year, Scott Unbelievable move stock went all the way down.
BULL12|Tord Seven got all the way up towards 20 a month ago.
BULL13|Got to 26 going into earnings, then pulled back significantly.
NEUT14|Now they're buying the January 22 calls.
NEUT15|About 7500 of those calls for $1.30.
NEUT16|So pretty aggressive buying their.
NEUT17|They're also selling upside and selling.
NEUT18|Downside puts all that really means is a very bullish 3 way trade, but the focus is on the 75122 calls.
NEUT19|I bought both of these, I'm in AMD.
NEUT20|I'm also in these and I'll be in these all the way up to that January expiration.
BULL21|"'cause I think gap stores definitely has some upside still in front of it."""
