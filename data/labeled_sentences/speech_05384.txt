NEUT0|"""Hello everyone this is will talk soon."
NEUT1|Chief strategist here at Northgate trading.
NEUT2|It's Sunday, February 21st where I am here in Los Angeles and I just wanted to upload this short video clip to share my take on the US dollar Chief or Swiss Franc.
NEUT3|Bear in mind, however, that this represents my own personal view and is not intended as any kind of recommendation to buy or sell any financial assets.
NEUT4|I'm not a licensed financial advisor, so any decision you make needs to be based on your.
NEUT5|Own opinions and due diligence.
BEAR6|That said, I'm looking at a four hour chart and it looks to me like the Dollar Chief might be headed higher after having fallen from at least last November about earlier.
BULL7|So I'm hoping to see a climb from where it is now at around 8979.
NEUT8|And I'll be watching over the next few days to see if it follows through and maybe even eventually hits my take profit target.
NEUT9|In the meantime, good luck to all of Hugh, and until next time, if there is a next time.
NEUT10|"Hasta luego miss amigos."""
