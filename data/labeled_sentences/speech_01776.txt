BULL0|"""Welcome back to the channel guys."
NEUT1|And just before we start the video, please like and subscribe.
NEUT2|If you do enjoy as we're trying to hit 100 Subs before the end of the month, I'll appreciate it very very much if you do and let's get straight on with the video right?
NEUT3|Guys?
NEUT4|In this video we're taking a look at the Coca Cola dividend and reminding you guys to buy it.
NEUT5|Now if you want the next upcoming dividend, the next ex dividend date for Coca Cola is the 12th of March.
NEUT6|So Friday this week.
NEUT7|So I recommend you buy it tomorrow.
NEUT8|If you do want that dividend.
BULL9|As you can see here, Coca Cola have had a bit of a good run up over the past week.
BULL10|If we go here you can see they're up nearly 2 1/2% in just the past five days.
BULL11|And there up over percent today.
NEUT12|I'm not going to do a full stock review on Coca Cola.
NEUT13|In this video will just be looking at the dividend.
NEUT14|But I do have a stock review on it and I'll leave a card in the top right hand corner if you want to check that out.
NEUT15|So we're going to be using dividend Max to take a look at Coca Cola's dividend.
NEUT16|I think I think this is a great website to use when looking at different companies dividends, but I'm not at all affiliated with them as you can see at the top with the dividend summary Coker's next dividend ex date is in two days and for $0.42 and then will be paid in 22 days on the 1st of April here.
BEAR17|The previous Coca Cola dividend what was thought was less.
NEUT18|It was $0.41 and that was paid 3 months ago.
NEUT19|So basically last quarter and there are basically four dividends per year for Coca Cola, except from the special dividends.
NEUT20|And as you can see here the next dividend will be $0.42.
NEUT21|The ex date will be on the 12th of March, so Friday this week and then we paid like it says on the 1st of April their dividend yield currently is 3.3%.
BEAR22|Though I do think it's slightly below this actually actually about 3.27%.
NEUT23|And here the forecast accuracy is 98%, so it is pretty predictable.
NEUT24|There's great feature and dividend Max where you can put in the amount of dividends you have an accompanying.
NEUT25|It'll work out for you.
NEUT26|So say here if I have 15 Coca-Cola David sorry 15 Coca Cola stocks, I'll get $6.30 on the 1st of April when they pay their next dividend.
BULL27|As you can see here, if we look at their annual dividends we can see the Coca Cola has been increasing over the past few years.
NEUT28|What is good and if we look at the dividend yield is sort of.
BULL29|Increase when they had their drop in share price but is now back to the 3% what is been around normal so there's more information about the Coca Cola dividend.
NEUT30|If you want to take a look at the dividend Max website or take a look online but I just wanted to show you guys that the Coca Cola dividend will ex dividend date will be on Friday and tell you guys if you want to get into Coca Cola and you've been looking at it for awhile.
NEUT31|I get in it tomorrow so you can get that next dividend of $0.42.
NEUT32|So guys is it for today's video?
