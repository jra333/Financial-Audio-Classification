NEUT0|"""Hi, my name is Adam with uploadwordpress.com and in this video I'm going to show you how to quickly edit product images so that they have an all white background."
NEUT1|So if you have any Commerce site you sell a lot of products or if you sell a lot of products on Amazon which requires an all white background for your product.
NEUT2|So here's a quick tutorial using Photoshop and how to how to edit them.
NEUT3|The slow way to do it would be to use the eraser tool.
NEUT4|And erase the entire Gray background and then go real close to the product image and trace all the way around it.
NEUT5|You can do it that way, but that will literally take you hours for just a few products.
NEUT6|So instead a faster way to do that.
NEUT7|Oops would be.
NEUT8|To select the one tool.
NEUT9|From the left hand side, the Magic Wand tool, and then set the tolerance to about 30.
NEUT10|And make sure that this middle box I contigious I think they say it is checked anti alias an sample.
NEUT11|All layers do not need to be checked.
NEUT12|Just this middle one.
NEUT13|And you can play around the tolerance and see what works best for you.
NEUT14|But I think 30 works pretty good.
NEUT15|So let me just zoom out here a little bit.
NEUT16|So here we go.
NEUT17|So if I select the one tool and then go ahead and click in the Gray area, you can see the data lines that go trace right around the product image.
NEUT18|And then if I hit the delete button a couple of times but go ahead and click delete a few times.
NEUT19|We get it all white background, perfectly traced just about perfectly traced around our product so then go ahead and click control D. That will get rid of the.
NEUT20|Dotted lines, now we have a perfectly edited product image.
NEUT21|We literally did that in seconds versus.
NEUT22|5 to 10 minutes to try to trace around this entire product image with the eraser tool like I used to do so.
BULL23|Again, if you have any calmer site and you sell a lot of products, you know the value in being able to edit image images quickly and get new products live, so hopefully this quick tutorial video will help you out.
NEUT24|Again, what I did is I just selected the one tool I set the tolerance to 30.
NEUT25|I made sure this middle button was checked and then just go ahead and click in the area that you want to.
NEUT26|Turn white the background and then just hit delete and you'll have a perfectly white background.
NEUT27|"So again, my name is Adam with uploadwordpress.com and thanks for watching this video."""
