NEUT0|"""Well, you guys mentioned Apple and we're going to be watching that hosting surprise event on December 2nd that will honor the company's favorite apps and games of 2019."
NEUT1|Apple is not expected to release any new products at the event, but Joanna, I don't think they've done this before.
NEUT2|It's always been released in the past, right?
NEUT3|Yeah, it's always, I mean, if you look back at the past years every time around this year around this time of the year, they do their top apps list top apps, top games, all the different qualifications of apps in the App Store, and they sort of make a big web page and they sort of just, you know, quietly, say well, we love these apps.
NEUT4|Download them on your new devices.
NEUT5|This year it seems like they're you know, rolling out a little bit of the red carpet for the developers probably bring some executives, and I think it's an interesting time for Apple to do this.
NEUT6|Obviously with all the App Store scrutiny and around regulation, I really don't think it's much more than that, though I don't think we're going to see new hardware.
NEUT7|I don't really expect any major announcements about the App Store.
NEUT8|Maybe a little bit about momentum.
NEUT9|Maybe numbers of apps, maybe numbers of downloads, but that's it for today.
BULL10|I, I agree.
NEUT11|I don't think Tim Cook is going to miss the opportunity with the attention that he's going to create on December 2nd.
NEUT12|To to put pump some new blood into Apple TV.
NEUT13|Plus because it's on life support right now, it's not doing it Newport.
NEUT14|What do you mean?
NEUT15|It's on life support?
NEUT16|'cause of the morning show?
BEAR17|The reviews weren't good at all.
NEUT18|None of his content and he's got.
NEUT19|So what he's going to do on December 2nd I'm sure is say look at all the new content we're bringing in.
NEUT20|Movies were going to bring music we're going to.
NEUT21|We're going to do all kinds of things that nobody's ever heard of with Apple TV.
NEUT22|Plus an, he's gotta do something to jump start it because the reviews and the audiences and the subscribers.
NEUT23|Are not there for Apple TV.
NEUT24|I'm going to make this bet if you're if you're wrong, you can pet.
NEUT25|Well, you are going to be wrong, so I'm gonna be right an if.
NEUT26|And if you are right I will pay for your Apple TV plus subscription for the next three years.
NEUT27|Magnet.
NEUT28|Isn't that so nice.
BULL29|It's done and I actually like the morning show, so that's that's a great market.
NEUT30|"It's nice to so three years if if you're right, but you're not going, so that's all, right?"""
