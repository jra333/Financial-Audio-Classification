BULL0|"""And it you saw it writ large today with a pair of stellar quarters from Home Depot and Walmart."
BULL1|Now by the way, these were some of the best numbers I have ever seen.
NEUT2|Home Depot.
BULL3|Put up a 24% same store sales growth number.
NEUT4|I've never seen anything like that's incredible.
NEUT5|No never.
BULL6|Meanwhile, Walmarts USE Commerce business shot up 79% year over year.
BEAR7|Yet both stocks just got annihilated today.
NEUT8|You know why?
BEAR9|Because the vaccine is a headwind for them.
NEUT10|There's no way Home Depot or Walmart can keep delivering this kind of growth once the world goes back to normal.
BULL11|The only way they can keep putting up such great results is if we're still stuck inside next year renovating our homes with help from Home Depot.
NEUT12|We order all sorts of stuff from Walmart's website, but thanks to Pfizer Moderna.
NEUT13|Well, that's not where we're headed.
NEUT14|You take away the stay at home economy and these two stories become a lot less attractive.
NEUT15|What we really need Walmarts local e-commerce when we can safely go out and shop anywhere.
NEUT16|Maybe some of us will be so enamored with Walmart's digital offering will never, ever go back to a brick and mortar store again.
NEUT17|But I bet most people can't wait to shop normally.
NEUT18|I mean, really.
NEUT19|I mean, people like to shop members, Mark.
NEUT20|As for Home Depot.
NEUT21|I'm sure some people will keep fleeing to the from the city to the suburbs, but once the vaccines everywhere, well, maybe that changes the incentives.
NEUT22|Maybe we'll still need new appliances and chairs and sofas made by Whirlpool or Herman Miller, but well, we need more tools for Stanley Black and Decker.
NEUT23|Maybe we have more.
NEUT24|Have a lumber flooring.
NEUT25|I mean, there's only so many times you can model, right?
