NEUT0|"""If I get to stock pics very quickly this evening when you're going for Visa."
BULL1|Came up with results and the result would fantastic.
BULL2|Earnings were up in their beat market expectations a little bit, but the structure of the company.
NEUT3|Massive question.
NEUT4|Booty huge cash generation and the one thing that Covid has done is which does more all on hand made by pot.
NEUT5|I mean, it's actually quite odd you don't carry cash and you are not going to buy little things on the way back from work on the way to work with the way to meet friends, you got no more money.
NEUT6|Everything's game on hard.
BULL7|So yeah, yeah, and that's a price performance.
BEAR8|Today was actually pretty good, notwithstanding the results.
BEAR9|David, your bank Disney, which in the shape performance was staggering.
BEAR10|Considering the results weren't weren't great.
NEUT11|Well, yeah, I chose it before I saw that the price of run already by 10% but never this where it's coming from is.
NEUT12|They've got 100,000,000 subscribers.
NEUT13|Now I think I'm Disney plus so.
BEAR14|That it is really becoming very successful, and if they're losing on the theme parks are losing on the entertainment side in there.
NEUT15|But they've also made money by not paying.
NEUT16|You know, all the sports companies for the rights because they're not playing sports with his behaviors.
NEUT17|Cost, cost, cutting, going there, but they've got a magnificent array or library of content in that.
BULL18|And it's a very good site.
BULL19|I can imagine as long as we we are where we are and they're going to continue to attract more supporters and they've got Hulu as well.
NEUT20|That's an outside.
NEUT21|Disney is the family site you know, so I don't say they raunchy movies you get on Hulu, but they're not, you know, they're not those cute little people running around or animals on there, so that, but I still like him.
NEUT22|They I prefer them to Netflix.
NEUT23|Yeah, yeah, OK, nothing wrong with a bit of animation animated escapism.
NEUT24|David Wayne.
BULL25|Thanks very much for joining us this evening.
