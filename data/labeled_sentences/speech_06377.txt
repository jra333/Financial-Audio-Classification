NEUT1|Video chart on ticker symbol, AMZN.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, not a very eventful day in this sense of the price breaking you know above or below any of the key technical areas, but a very eventful day in the sense of just building another level that there's just going to be so many more people watching now before today even happened, I talked about that red line there at 3220, talked about it as an area of resistance, and look right where the price got rejected.
NEUT6|Today.
NEUT7|Lo and behold, right at that red line of 3220, which means that there's going to be just that many more people going.
BULL8|Oh, wow 3220, that is a very stubborn level of resistance.
NEUT9|And that is important because the more people that are watching the same level and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy called whatever you want, it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT10|So while nothing is guaranteed, my core point here is this.
NEUT11|It is just that much more rational.
BEAR12|It's that much more valid to think that if the price can work its way up to 3220 and get a break of it that break in and of itself could very well create a whole lot of upside buying pressure 'cause you're going to have just that many more breakout players now watching that area.
NEUT13|So 3220 it was already a key level moving into today.
NEUT14|But now that today has a curd, I mean, it is just that much more of an important area.
NEUT15|So definitely keep a very close eye on 3220 from the resistance side of things.
NEUT16|As far as levels of support or concern, nothing here has changed either.
NEUT17|Talked about that pink line in the previous video, which I might charge.
NEUT18|You notes that 200.
NEUT19|Moving average being the key level of support.
BULL20|And today you can see the price came down there and I got somewhat close to it.
BULL21|I mean, didn't bounce off it exactly, but guys in the general vicinity of it and once again held strong, so that remains the main level of support.
NEUT22|But yeah, it's all about that 3220 Mark moving forward.
NEUT23|So let's see if the price can get the break of that or not.
NEUT24|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT26|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL27|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT28|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT29|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR30|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT33|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT35|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT36|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
