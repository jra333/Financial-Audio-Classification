NEUT0|"""Remember, just take two interactive."
NEUT1|Obviously they created Grand Theft Auto through Rockstar, which is a company that is considered to be the absolute best is worth 18 billion.
NEUT2|Now are we going to have some crazy price for unity that exceeds that in the same way that people are still buzzing about what happened with Snowflake?
NEUT3|Snowflake went from being something that was incredibly exciting to being something that felt like a top for a lot of people.
NEUT4|I just think the money is going elsewhere.
NEUT5|I think it's going to the new course in the Dallas.
NEUT6|There's not, and there's not enough industrials to be able to handle the money that's coming out, but.
NEUT7|Let's watch this, and if it's another one that is just way too high, it's going to be another one day.
NEUT8|But there are people going to say, you know what I've had enough.
NEUT9|I think that people should be very concerned about what I regard as being a total hangover from stuff like yeah, I'm looking at Snowflake now.
BEAR10|I mean after yesterday's decline, but it's still.
NEUT11|I don't know where the multiple to revenues is at this point.
NEUT12|Still, gotta 60 plus billion dollar market value is 100.
NEUT13|It's called 100.
NEUT14|It's still 100.
NEUT15|Well let's see 231.
BULL16|You know the high was 319.
NEUT17|You know all I can tell you David is is that it's absurd versus its own group versus its own group member.
NEUT18|Zoom is the fastest growing zoom.
NEUT19|Also there bout similar growth, but guess what?
NEUT20|Zoom is incredibly profitable right?
NEUT21|And zooms at 50 times a lot of people felt that the under writers that are bad prices they priced it.
NEUT22|Zoom level Zoom is the most expensive company in the market until Snowflake.
NEUT23|I think one of the difficulties people have.
NEUT24|Carl is a snowflake is not that easy to understand.
NEUT25|I dialed downloaded stuff like you know when it says like allowed versus not allow.
NEUT26|I'm getting a snowflake.
NEUT27|Add every.
NEUT28|Every like half hour to trial.
NEUT29|And then there's some bot that asked me what I'm looking for.
NEUT30|I don't know what to tell the bot.
NEUT31|I feel terrible, but it's not to buy pot has feelings if you prick it, it does not bleed, but it is just something.
NEUT32|"All I could say is that Snowflake is too difficult to understand for the people who bought the stock and Frank Slootman is so great."""
