NEUT0|"""So far, what should be the takeaway for our non professional investor audience that's watching right now?"
NEUT1|What should we learn and know from what happened there?
NEUT2|Well, it's about leverage.
NEUT3|It's about making sure that you don't fly too close to the sun with your investment process.
BEAR4|There are going to be other funds similar to this experience that we saw this week where there is going to be a blow up.
NEUT5|So what can you do to control risk as an individual investor or a portfolio manager?
NEUT6|You should be buying the highest quality investments that are consistently growing consistently profitable and don't have a lot of leverage or debt on their balance sheet.
NEUT7|So for example, look at companies that also have this incredible durability to them operationally, so that if they go through a recession or a pandemic or even a depression, they will come out the other end and survive.
BULL8|Yeah, and it's a good lesson.
NEUT9|I mean, First off they can always rely on pros like you because that you get paid to do the hard work to dig down into these balance sheets.
NEUT10|But if you're if you're somebody at home that's just watching and kind of fiddling around with the market, you know it's pretty easy to see some of the you know, there's two sides to a balance sheet, right?
NEUT11|You've got assets and liabilities.
NEUT12|Look at the liabilities.
NEUT13|Is that why?
NEUT14|I mean for all the **** stuff we talk about Chad, you like the maker of spam and Dinty Moore beef Stew.
NEUT15|Right, correct?
NEUT16|So this is perhaps one of the more boring conversations to be had, but a company like Hormel that actually is reinvesting back into their business, growing, and has an organic growth rate of three to 5% and does not have a lot of debt on their balance sheet and sheep in his back, they've got more cash on their balance sheet than they do debt.
NEUT17|So this is a durable of of balance sheet, durable company.
NEUT18|Also look at a company like Pepsi.
NEUT19|Or, for example, Coca Cola.
NEUT20|Those companies as well their valuations also makes sense, and that's the most important thing in a market where you're at a very extended valuation, you could look at these type of companies and own them for three to five years and do quite well.
BULL21|Yeah it's amazing.
NEUT22|I mean, think about that.
NEUT23|You maybe you got $5000 in credit card debt but you have $6000 in cash sitting in a savings account.
NEUT24|You know you could pay that off.
BULL25|It's pretty amazing that Hormel has more cash than debt.
NEUT26|Lot of talk about new priorities for this administration.
NEUT27|Not getting political chat, but you obviously believe that defense spending is not going to get crushed because I know you also like Raytheon and General Dynamics.
BULL28|So we think that the aerospace industry is going to open up and do quite well over the next 18 to 24 months.
BEAR29|General Dynamics as well as Raytheon have been the valuations have been compressed.
NEUT30|They are an industrial.
BULL31|We think that overall that also defense spending is going to be quite robust over the next 18 to 24 months.
BULL32|Again, similar to Hormel and Pepsi, their balance sheets are very very clean and also they have a predictable revenue line.
NEUT33|So we would be overweight.
NEUT34|This we look at 1820 eighteen to 24 months.
BULL35|We think there's going to be an increase in in regard to their dividend.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
