BULL0|"""Hey guys it's your girl Robbie privileged in today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about Netflix stocks now.
BEAR2|A lot of people are saying that Netflix has laws $9 billion because people are boycotting cuties.
NEUT3|Well here's the thing.
NEUT4|Cuties is now in the top five movies in the United States of America or Netflix and if we look at Netflix, is financial history.
BULL5|Netflix started out really low and they have been substantially gaining even now.
BEAR6|While people are claiming that the stock has dipped, Netflix is still.
NEUT7|Making more money than in made in 2018.
NEUT8|In 2019, Netflix lost $17 billion and guess what, there's still alive and kicking.
BULL9|The reality is, Netflix has gained more subscribers during the pandemic than it actually had for all of 2019.
NEUT10|So if people unsubscribe from Netflix, great, but just know that.
NEUT11|Don't believe everything and don't believe everything that everybody tells you.
NEUT12|Netflix is still alive and kicking.
NEUT13|Yes, they have taken dips.
NEUT14|But still have a lot of other stocks.
BEAR15|This is actually the final quarter of the year, so companies are losing a bit of money as we are still stuck in this pandemic and the job market is shifting and people going back to work and dealing with school and not being able to afford luxuries like streaming services that also has a major component to people unsubscribing.
NEUT16|I know you guys want to think about the outrage, but again, if you guys were really canceling Netflix, there would be a much more dramatic shift in energy.
NEUT17|And subscription rate.
NEUT18|"Anyway, you guys fly free because it's a privilege and take care."""
