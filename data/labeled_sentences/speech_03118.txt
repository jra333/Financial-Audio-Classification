NEUT5|It's a great opportunity and we'd love to have you alright, so let's take a look at this Facebook Daily chart right here.
BEAR6|We've got this uptrend.
NEUT7|Right here we've got a channel right here, so this is the top of the channel.
NEUT8|This is the bottom of the channel.
BULL9|As you can see you following along this really what helped you out on some day trades right here is we've been bouncing off of this channel several times.
BULL10|If we make it up to the top of the channel, that could be a nice little short for a day trade or a short term swing trade, but overall I've been cautious on Facebook, but we are breaking over this resistance right here.
BULL11|OK, I really want to see you know another stronger candle above this resistance, but right now this 110 level is going to be support.
BULL12|We've got the support from this channel right here.
BULL13|The bottom of that Channel, and we've got the support from this resistance line, which is now support right.
NEUT14|There were over these highs over there.
NEUT15|And the main key was getting above this level right here.
NEUT16|OK?
NEUT17|And we did that.
BULL18|OK, so we're above over here and we've got the highest close that we've had.
NEUT19|In a long time OK since over here.
BULL20|So since early February is the highest close since early February, we're looking pretty good.
NEUT21|We've got tight blonde hair bands right here, so we could be seeing a bigger move for Facebook right here.
NEUT22|OK, I'm cautiously.
BEAR23|Bullish at the moment just because this was a pretty wicked false breakout right here.
BULL24|We saw a really nice move to the upside.
BEAR25|And then we just got smacked down right there.
NEUT26|OK, this is.
BEAR27|I know it's just a few days action right here, but this is somewhat concerning at how violent and swiftly that move was over here.
BULL28|OK, but again, we are looking bullish.
BEAR29|We broke over this downtrend line right here.
BEAR30|I'm sorry over this resistance right here.
BULL31|We closed above it.
BULL32|We closed above yesterday's high indicators looking OK right here.
BULL33|Makde looking OK, right here.
NEUT34|We've got stochastics pointing up so pretty decent look right here.
NEUT35|Could be retesting these highs at 1:15, so we'll see what happens right there.
BULL36|But definitely if we if we continue to break over this these highs right here over about 1:11, I definitely think we're going to tag at least 115 up here in the near future.
BULL37|Alright guys, thanks for watching.
