BEAR1|It's August that's depressing trading volumes and sparking moves that honestly are not worth taking too seriously.
BEAR2|Still, for what it's worth, there's been an abrupt change of tone.
BULL3|Yesterday, the trio of main U.S. stock indices, the S&P, Dow, and NASDAQ all hit record highs again.
BULL4|But the good vibes have not lasted overnight.
BEAR5|Asian stocks dipped.
BULL6|The oil rally hit the skids a bit, and the yen one of the key gauges of investor nerves sailed higher once again, be warned.
BEAR7|That leaves the currency squarely in the intervention zone.
BEAR8|The dollar is also pulling back across the board, feeding that fresh data yesterday shows that manufacturing in New York pulled back to levels last seen in February.
NEUT9|That's just one piece of data, but it reinforces the case for the Fed to stay lower for longer.
BEAR10|If you're looking for more reasons to be gloomy, checkout Anglo Australian miner, BHP Billiton, which has churned out a record $6.4 billion annual loss.
BEAR11|One of costs have not helped here, but it has warned that commodity prices are likely to stay low.
NEUT12|"Volatile for some time to come."""
