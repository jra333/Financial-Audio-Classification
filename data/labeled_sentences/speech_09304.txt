NEUT0|"""Professor on my challenge."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this video.
NEUT2|Friends.
NEUT3|In this video we are going to discuss about Boxlight Corp and first of all we have very limited amount of data, but we're looking at a weekly chart but it really it can give us an A sense of an intermediate trend.
NEUT4|So that will be fine for us.
NEUT5|Now if you looking at this chart, there are some clear indications or trending actions which are happening in between a range.
NEUT6|So let me tell you what an what, how this is happening and what are the things that you need to look and understand over here.
NEUT7|OK, so this is the trading range inside which the price action is happening for the time being and you need not to go beyond or below or above the range.
NEUT8|So on the downside.
NEUT9|You will have.
NEUT10|Your support, which is in between.
NEUT11|As you can see here, by 1.15 and 1.31.
BULL12|Now, because the stock has moved a bit, so the immediate support will become.
NEUT13|Here.
NEUT14|Around 1.68 or 1.65 or I would 7.6 OK, so this is the immediate support and your next support will come in between 1.3 and 1.15.
NEUT15|Now, on the upside, we are looking at a target.
NEUT16|On our first target, if it holds about 1.6, then $3 will be our first upside.
NEUT17|And it can extend up to or in between 4.48 and 4.47.
NEUT18|4.7 dollars with your pardon as our big target.
BULL19|So looking at the current price action, we can probably see that if the stock hold the current level, we have a decent amount of trading action which is yet to be seen in the upcoming weeks and in the upcoming months.
NEUT20|And what you need to do, you need not to go beyond the range you need not to become over bullish or over bearish.
NEUT21|You need to be disciplined.
NEUT22|So if the stock, let's say, falls below 1.3, or the last support is 1.15, so the stock falls below 1.15, you simply moved out from the position.
NEUT23|There is no need carrying further positions on the downside.
NEUT24|On the upside, if it holds above 1.62, which it is, and if it falls back towards 1.31, that's fine.
BULL25|But as I told you should not break the support level, so if it holds the support level we can see our first target at three point, $1.00 an it can go up to 4.48 or 4.7 dollars on the upside.
NEUT26|So this is the end of the video.
