BEAR0|"""It's very harmful for the economy and they really be ashamed of themselves."
NEUT1|Kevin, I'm actually not ashamed of myself at all.
NEUT2|I just wish that you know, some sentient economists would go talk to these guys and explain to them how buybacks work, how capital markets work.
NEUT3|It sounds like Trump's chief economist could use a bit of background on why stock buybacks matter from a fellow economist.
NEUT4|So I'm here to help.
NEUT5|Buybacks are a common tool used by corporate executives to increase the price of the company's remaining shares.
NEUT6|It works by simple arithmetic.
NEUT7|Once a company buys back its own shares, each remaining share or slice ends up representing a larger portion of the corporate pie.
NEUT8|This might sound like boring corporate finance issues, but companies authorized $1.1 trillion on stock buybacks in 2018.
NEUT9|Alone spoke about the folks trillion dollars in stock buybacks.
BEAR10|And yet these companies like, oh, we just don't have the money to pay workers a living wage for my decent health benefits.
NEUT11|Provide sick leave.
NEUT12|That's nonsense.
NEUT13|Profitable corporations are massively rewarding shareholders.
BULL14|Will ignoring workers demands for higher wages.
BEAR15|It's very disappointing that over and over again I see the Democrats pursue like really economically illiterate proposals.
NEUT16|Just because they think they sound good politically.
BEAR17|When shareholders demand more and more spending on buybacks to raise share prices, that puts pressure on management to cut costs.
NEUT18|An excuse to ignore workers demands for higher wages.
NEUT19|For example, Walmart authorized $20 billion in stock buybacks in 2017 if Walmart had used just half those funds to raise workers wages.
BULL20|All 1,000,000 hourly Walmart workers could have seen a raise of $5.66 an hour.
NEUT21|In the case of Walmart, just a few descendants.
NEUT22|Sam Walton own over half the shares.
NEUT23|When a firm like Apple buys back its shares, then you know those that equity goes to some others start up firm that is investing in communities.
NEUT24|And so I'm trying to what Kevin claimed.
NEUT25|Generally more funds are flowing out to shareholders that are flowing back into hell.
NEUT26|Public companies grow.
NEUT27|I think they're trying to make a political point about the spike in buybacks which this is associated with the tax cuts.
NEUT28|But it's kind of a one time thing, right?
NEUT29|Buybacks are not a one time thing.
NEUT30|Spending on them has been going on for decades, and in 2017.
NEUT31|Before the Trump Tax Reform Corporation spent $781 billion on buybacks.
NEUT32|Corporate executives generally know when 5X are happening, unlike the rest of us, and can time selling their own personal Holdings.
NEUT33|And you can only benefit if you own stock in the 1st place.
NEUT34|Stock ownership is incredibly concentrated among the wealthy.
NEUT35|Only 15% of Latino or African American families have meaningful stock ownership.
NEUT36|We can do this.
NEUT37|I have zero down chunk that the overwhelming majority of the American people are supportive of.
NEUT38|Are they hate when they hear about what these type stock buybacks are.
BEAR39|They really dislike them.
BEAR40|"They hate them."""
