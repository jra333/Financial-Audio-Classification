NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
BULL1|Hope you're having a great day.
NEUT2|Is always Tesla to the moon.
BULL3|Baby Battery Day is hyping the stock up on believable E. Not only has this stock surged just now, but it's been surging all week for the anticipation of the Million mile battery.
NEUT4|This is huge news for Tesla and I want to kind of talk about how I'm playing Tesla in my thoughts on Tesla.
NEUT5|Now my thoughts on Tesla.
NEUT6|For the price, it's at right now.
NEUT7|If you're talking long term, I think great, it's a buy.
BULL8|It's a good hold.
NEUT9|If we're talking trading the stock, I'm saying bye now an by battery day.
NEUT10|If you're looking to lock in profits, do it because we can see the volatility in Tesla's massive.
BEAR11|We see some days it go up 1015 even percent to some days as we saw it went down 22%.
NEUT12|So it is very volatile an if you're going to play it.
NEUT13|Be very smart about how you play it.
BULL14|We've had ton of analysts that have been neutron Tessa, but have raised this stock prices just due to the anticipation of the Battery Day being life changing technology.
NEUT15|We also see somebody in Saudi Arabia.
NEUT16|This big fun wants to invest in EV companies that could be huge for Tesla.
NEUT17|Another big piece of news is.
NEUT18|The market for Tesla in China.
NEUT19|The momentum in China is a key market to Tesla's business model, and this one analyst said that China will account quote for over 40% of Tesla's global sales by early 2022.
NEUT20|That is huge.
NEUT21|'cause you don't just see Teslas selling just in America.
NEUT22|That means that there's a whole nuther profit to be made in different countries.
BULL23|And that is a huge thing that Tesla can gain on.
NEUT24|Another thing that we see with Tesla is their model of having all types of different businesses.
NEUT25|People aren't necessarily just betting on Tesla, but also are betting on Elon Musk.
BEAR26|If you also have a notice when he tweets the stock goes up in certain things that he does bad, the stock can go down.
NEUT27|This stock does not trade like a normal stock, so if you are scared to lose money or this is your first kind of trade or bargains at some of these call options, just stay away from it.
NEUT28|Because it is very volatile and if you don't know what you're doing, it can be very very risky.
BULL29|My prediction stand strong with Tesla, though I believe in the company.
NEUT30|I believe in the goal there China achieve.
NEUT31|I love their cars and would use their products.
NEUT32|So if you're investing in a company First off, think what I use their products.
NEUT33|Do I like their product?
BULL34|Sandhu, I see a gain in the company's finances in the further future.
