BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to how to be a success on the stock market."
NEUT1|We have the YouTube sensation we're in Kerman joining us.
NEUT2|What is the formula for success in playing stocks?
NEUT3|You're 22 years old?
NEUT4|You've been doing it since she was 12.
NEUT5|What's your secret?
NEUT6|It's pattern recognition.
NEUT7|Just understanding how history tends to repeat itself, it's like we're looking for specific patterns.
NEUT8|And then when we see those patterns, we base our trades off of those patterns.
NEUT9|Are you able to get rich from doing this?
NEUT10|It is possible.
NEUT11|I first started, you know, just making a couple $100.
NEUT12|And then like last week I had a week where I made a little bit over $60,000 net.
BULL13|So if you scale your account and continue to compound it, you can see consistent results here 22 years.
NEUT14|So do you have a live?
NEUT15|Is this all you do?
NEUT16|This is all I focus on.
NEUT17|I'm just buried in my work and then also teaching my students as well how to do it.
NEUT18|How often do you teach?
NEUT19|I would say like two to four hours per day and what are you teaching?
NEUT20|I'm teaching people how to trade penny stocks, but you can also use my strategies on Midcap stocks, large cap stocks.
NEUT21|You can trade options with them so you can use them on pretty much anything you would want to use them on in the stock market.
NEUT22|So what's the key to trading stock?
NEUT23|I focus on technical analysis and then like I said, I built a trading system that revolves around psychology, risk management, position sizing, but the key for me would be price action.
NEUT24|Just understanding how stock prices react rather than focusing on the news and stuff like that.
NEUT25|So stocks are safe if you do your homework.
NEUT26|If you do your homework and understand on what it is that you're doing, it can be very safe.
NEUT27|Like when I first tell people like I traded stocks they don't know anything about it.
NEUT28|They think it's like gambling.
NEUT29|They think it's really risky, but the reality of the situation is it's not you, just have to understand how much you're going to risk to get the reward.
NEUT30|So like in my situation, I'll set up a stop loss where I risk 2% of my account and then if I'm right and get out at my price, target my exit my desired exit.
