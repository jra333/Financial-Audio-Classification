BEAR0|"""Why did fastly lower its revenue forecast OK?"
BEAR1|The biggest customers tick Tock the popular video sharing platform that's beloved by kids but hated by the Trump administration over the summer, the Tick Tock business seemed like a liability for fastly because Trump wanted to shut them down.
BEAR2|Eventually they reached a deal with Oracle and we soon maybe the problem go away, but it turns out the uncertain geopolitical environment has reduced fastly's revenue from Tick Tock, at least in the third quarter.
NEUT3|And by the way, Facebook's got a competing product to give the faster reports, is full results in about 3 weeks.
BEAR4|I'm betting the quarter obviously is going to be ugly.
NEUT5|Otherwise they would have had pronounced like this, but maybe it's temporary.
NEUT6|It may be it's already resolved.
NEUT7|Look, I'm not saying fast, he's done going down the stock very expensive even before the negative.
NEUT8|Pre announcements at the close it was selling for 32 times.
NEUT9|Next year's sales forecast, which is probably among the five most expensive stocks that I follow.
BEAR10|I said this morning it has a terrible set of traders in IT.
NEUT11|People have no idea what it does and don't even care.
NEUT12|I said that they just knew that it goes higher, which is why they liked it.
NEUT13|Or knew it goes higher until tonight?
BULL14|Fastest still got excellent.
BULL15|Growth is still rapidly approaching.
BEAR16|Profitability is still beloved by its clients, but now it has to suffer through a series of downgrades and an exit by people who know nothing about it.
BEAR17|More than a terrible nickname.
NEUT18|Not kidding.
NEUT19|So I think you have to be opportunistic at this talk.
NEUT20|Really get slammed again tomorrow.
NEUT21|Maybe you can start buying in the weakness.
BEAR22|These stocks never recover in one day.
NEUT23|Never never under pre announcement.
NEUT24|They don't.
NEUT25|Sometimes you have to wait a full quarter for it to really start restore recharge, but it's been slammed down the 70s or 80s before its bounce.
BULL26|I wouldn't be surprised if that could happen again, although it might go down more before it starts rebounding.
NEUT27|Here's the bottom line, even after this brutal negative pre announcement, the first story is pretty much intact, but the problem is really just tick tock.
NEUT28|It can make you come back.
BEAR29|Fact is that this is a wild trader that was due for a big sell off anyway, because as I said this very morning, there was too much ignorant money in fastly.
BEAR30|Now the stock has been significantly derisked.
BEAR31|The ignorant money is fleeing like rats on a sinking ship.
NEUT32|Actually like it more if it keeps falling and you get in the 70s.
NEUT33|Maybe a starter position and get ready for some stabilization.
