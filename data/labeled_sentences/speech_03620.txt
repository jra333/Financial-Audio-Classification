BULL0|"""There's a better way to measure the economy, and the implications are profoundly positive."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times.
NEUT2|The US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bea, just released a different way to measure how the economy is doing.
NEUT3|In addition to the number we're all accustomed to gross domestic product or GDP.
NEUT4|Every three months we eagerly await the GDP number from the Bea to see how well or badly things are going.
NEUT5|The new metric is called gross output or Geo boring stuff only on the surface as Geo becomes more widely known, it will enormously impact economic policy for the better.
NEUT6|The difference between GDP and Geo is the difference between an X Ray and a CAT scan engaging what's happening inside your body.
NEUT7|GDP virtually ignores business to business activity.
NEUT8|It brushes aside supply chains.
NEUT9|That is the activity that takes place in making products and services.
NEUT10|GDP leaves out more than half of these spending in the economy would be like a restaurant leaving out the rent in the cost of doing business.
NEUT11|The Geo number gives a more accurate picture of what truly makes the economy tick.
NEUT12|Yet for decades, despite its flaws, GDP has been held as the ultimate measure of how an economy is doing.
BEAR13|The problem is that GDP makes it look like consumer spending makes up 2/3 of the economy was secondary roles for business and government spending.
NEUT14|But consumers can't consume and less this stuff they buy is made in the 1st place.
NEUT15|It's like thinking of a carton of milk just shows up in the store shelf and ignoring the milk cow, the dairy farm, the bottle of the milk and the truck that delivers the milk to the store.
NEUT16|It turns out that the business sector is vastly more important than the consumer or government when it comes to the health of the economy.
NEUT17|As noted, economist Mark Skousen, who, unlike most of his peers, has long recognized the importance of gross output.
BULL18|He puts it business achievement, technology entrepreneurship are the catalysts that drive economic growth and an improved standard of living.
NEUT19|Consumer spending is the effect, not the cause, of prosperity.
NEUT20|Look at Seattle before covered in the recent riots.
BULL21|Seattle was a thriving, fast growing area.
BEAR22|Was it because residents years ago decided to Max out their credit cards and go on a spending binge?
NEUT23|Obviously not.
BULL24|It was the extraordinary expansion of companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Boeing, Costco and Starbucks.
NEUT25|That fueled this amazing boom.
NEUT26|As Geo becomes more widely known, policy makers will increasingly recognize that piling taxes on businesses and on savings as the Democrats are now proposing, are absolutely destructive to a vibrant opportunity creating economy.
BULL27|This realization will help us enjoy a better future.
NEUT28|I'm Steve Forbes.
