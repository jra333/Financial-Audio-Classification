NEUT0|"""Those are the seven heavenly ways to make money in this market right now."
NEUT1|But they can turn into seven deadly sins if you're not careful.
NEUT2|The reopening trade that's hostage to the pandemic.
BULL3|We could get a load of new cases, especially this New South African strain.
BULL4|More resistant to vaccines, I think we'll be able to get covid under control, but we've been wrong about that before.
BEAR5|Plus if the stimulus bill fails, the retailers are going to hit housing.
BEAR6|As the economy improves and rates go higher still a long way long way away, the housing bull market will get hurt.
NEUT7|That's inevitable.
BEAR8|Could take years to become a problem.
NEUT9|Could take a year.
NEUT10|Theme 3 The industrials look these stocks only work if employment picks up and business quickly snaps back.
BEAR11|If the recovery folders they are insanely expensive on a price to earnings.
BULL12|Multiple basis energy, it shows good now, but that's because Opec's being disciplined.
BEAR13|Eventually prices will get high enough that the Saudis will stop limiting production, and when that happened, oil producers will get hammered.
NEUT14|Hoods at 58 wouldn't surprise me if the Saudis open that app at 60.
NEUT15|Game five, the bank so their greatest rates don't show you his way to kind of go higher, but not too high because that puts real pressure downward on loan demand.
NEUT16|Yeah, we're not doing it, but that's an integral part of the business cycle.
NEUT17|Six.
NEUT18|What happens to all these new stock pickers when they run out of good targets?
NEUT19|There are only so many game stops.
BEAR20|Go around, plan for short squeeze without better clearing systems, a lot of merry men could get hurt.
NEUT21|Finally, the 7th and by far the most deadly sin.
NEUT22|All these companies with no warnings that are being pitched on the basis of revenue projections, including the specs.
NEUT23|Many of these stocks are exciting and they all seem to have a mission.
NEUT24|But in recent months, we've seen more and more, but I call celebrities backs.
BEAR25|And the whole thing feels excessive if you disagree with me, you're wrong.
BEAR26|There will come a tipping point where we start getting flooded with low quality specs and the whole group collapses under its own weight.
NEUT27|Yeah, we're not there yet.
NEUT28|The bottom line for now we're in the clear, but you need to watch these seven themes like a Hawk because eventually they'll turn ugly by take months.
NEUT29|Might take years.
NEUT30|Either way.
