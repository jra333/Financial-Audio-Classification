NEUT0|"""Visible miss on the bottom line, so revenue 75.5 billion."
NEUT1|The forecast was 73.6 billion in terms of the bottom line, we're looking at EPS of $5.01.
NEUT2|The forecast was for $6.25.
BULL3|North America revenue just ahead of expectations.
NEUT4|46.1 billion.
NEUT5|We've got international coming in at 19.1 billion.
NEUT6|That was in line.
NEUT7|So a WS.
NEUT8|Perhaps a little later when she got that number.
NEUT9|But given that the other one was slightly ahead, maybe a double?
NEUT10|In line will come back with that in a moment, but either way beat on the top line site miss on the bottom line.
BEAR11|Stock down about 2.6%.
NEUT12|As a result, Michael, we talked about the huge run up.
NEUT13|Of course it had coming into this.
BULL14|Yeah it was up 12% since the market peak of February 19, so obviously going in completely different directions so presumably everybody knew that it was going to be massive demand amount of the cost of delivering on that demand.
NEUT15|For for Amazon a little bit less discretionary type goods and things like that free cash flow down on a trailing 12 month basis they mentioned.
NEUT16|In here, so it does seem as if they didn't fully capitalize it on the on all this new business on the bottom line, but you know, I don't think it changes the overall story too much.
NEUT17|I do think that delivery cost is going to be perhaps some issue.
NEUT18|Well, there's so much text in this release.
NEUT19|It's going to take 25 minutes to go through it, but I'll just pick out one line on that point.
NEUT20|Mike, about profits.
NEUT21|So here's here's a quote from Jeff Bezos if you're a shareholder in Amazon, you may want to take a seat because we're not thinking small under normal circumstances.
NEUT22|And this coming in this coming Q2, we'd expect to make some 4 billion or more in operating profit.
NEUT23|But these aren't normal circumstances.
NEUT24|We're going to spend the entire T of that four billion basically talking about making the investments that they need to get their business.
BULL25|Up to speed and they say when it comes to a WS groceries retail on Amazon, they're being tested when it comes to just delivering and so much demand.
NEUT26|Because of this current crisis.
NEUT27|So there you go.
BULL28|I mean, they're back in spending mode, Mike.
NEUT29|No doubt about it and you wouldn't.
NEUT30|You know, I think you'd be surprised if it were otherwise, but the way it's articulated there fairly specific terms I think, brings it home.
NEUT31|I just mentioned the AWS number Sarah found it is 10.2 billion.
NEUT32|The forecast was was 10.3 billion.
BULL33|I mean, there's still the big leader in this area in terms of year over year growth.
NEUT34|That's 33% growth for that number, so you can't really argue with it.
BULL35|I guess Microsoft's beat relative to expectation was a bit stronger on that line in terms of cloud, but and unless.
BULL36|Stephanie 10.2 billion growing 30% plus per year for that very profitable part of the business.
NEUT37|Something still to celebrate and offers diversity of their earnings.
NEUT38|At this time.
NEUT39|I guess again it comes back to that point of how much was priced in and what this is going to mean to the bottom line.
BEAR40|"All this extra spending Stephanie going forward is down 6% as we as we speak in after hours straight."""
