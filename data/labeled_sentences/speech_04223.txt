NEUT0|"""Investors were just watching that call and just waiting to see how he was going to respond and when he is apologizing and what he's talking about."
BEAR1|Profit quarter after quarter you could just see that after hour trading just Spike and we've seen that this morning and I think people were kind of relieved that he just put on a boring conference call.
NEUT2|I want to see boring.
NEUT3|They want to see, I guess, some predictability in all of this.
NEUT4|But again, I guess what's the next test?
NEUT5|Or does this by him so much room that there's nothing unless he disrupts it?
NEUT6|Right, right now it's going to be about executing, right?
BULL7|I mean, he's shown the ability to do 5000 model threes in a single week.
NEUT8|Now he has to do it week after week after we can make that 50,055 thousand target this quarter and then continue to do that in the fourth quarter and just really just execute on the plan.
BULL9|We are seeing fill the Wall Street community kind of reacting in kind of this saying there are signs of life raising their price targets on some of these issues.
NEUT10|I mean this is something that people are going to look back and say this was a turning point.
NEUT11|Or well, yeah Becky.
NEUT12|I think some will look at this as an inflection point.
NEUT13|I've heard a few people say in the last 24 hours.
NEUT14|Well look this is a case where Elon finally put to rest any notion that this company might go bankrupt.
BEAR15|Might run out of money.
NEUT16|Look, there are a lot of hurdles in the future you were talking with Tim about, you know.
NEUT17|How much room does this buy them?
NEUT18|Theoretically it probably buys them three months, four months of a little bit of breathing room, but let's say they don't hit 6000 vehicles, 6000 model threes per week.
NEUT19|By the end of August it will take 5 minutes for Twitter to light up with people saying here we go, they cannot execute.
BEAR20|They cannot perform as they have promised.
NEUT21|And when you have China having to come on line relatively quickly, they haven't even broken ground there.
NEUT22|They haven't even signed the.
NEUT23|Aside from Memorandum of Understanding, I mean, there are a lot of details that still need to be worked out with that Tim has written about the fact that they're hoping to announce some kind of a factory in Europe, perhaps by the end of this year.
NEUT24|I mean, there are a lot of growth out there potentially, and there are also a lot of stumbling blocks out there in terms of can you hit this marker.
NEUT25|How quickly can you hit this marker?
NEUT26|Tim, you're definitely seeing some of the shorts get shaken out a little bit today, but my guess is some of the biggest names aren't going away anytime soon, right?
NEUT27|Yeah, right?
NEUT28|I mean so you know this.
NEUT29|The second quarter might be remembered as the period where the shorts will say hey, this is when the cracks in the facade started to really come clear and the downfall began.
NEUT30|Or you know, the second quarter might be that.
BULL31|In time in the Tesla big story in the big history when Elon Musk is his myth kind of grows and he was able to overcome all the hurdles and push the company and make the next Big Bang.
NEUT32|Which or do you think it is?
NEUT33|Well, I think time will tell, right?
NEUT34|We will see next year if you know how many model threes are able to crank out.
NEUT35|They said that they were producing about 5000 a week.
NEUT36|You believe that number?
NEUT37|The reason I asked the question is because if you look at the shorts who are running around Twitter, an online, they think that you know the books are being cooked somehow.
NEUT38|Well, yeah, I don't have any any proof to say that they didn't make 5000 a week at the end of last quarter.
NEUT39|"And if you look around parking lots around California, there's been lots of photos of you know, lots and lots of Model 3, so they're clearly cranking things out of that factory."""
