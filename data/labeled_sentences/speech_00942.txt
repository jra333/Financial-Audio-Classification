NEUT0|"""So what is this big call we talked about before the break for health?"
NEUT1|Solomon has the answer for sure.
NEUT2|Do hi Scott.
NEUT3|So yes, if you were still working on resolutions and need a resolution, stock Bernstein suggests Uber as the one to own in 2021.
BULL4|It expects positive adjusted EBIT da by the third quarter of 2021.
BULL5|Scott, that is in line with comments made on our air by Uber CEO back in November that he also expects to reach profitability in 2021.
BULL6|Bernstein sees positive momentum with the vaccine Regulation, an growth of delivery Uber by the way.
BULL7|Also up almost 80% year to date as you mentioned, and Bank of America says that their bullish on what they're calling the most unloved mega cap in the SMB, AT&T, the firm maintaining its buy rating with a price target of 36 bucks per share.
BULL8|Vevay notes at AT&T has been good at paying down its debt, refinancing at lower rates.
BULL9|And while they did not increase the dividend for the first time in 30 years, they did maintain it.
BULL10|Operationally, analysts like synergies being created by Warner Media and its HBO Max strategy got, well, appreciate it very much.
BULL11|Thank you very much.
NEUT12|I don't have any ownership on the desk of AT&T, Jim and Joshua.
NEUT13|Verizon, but I want to Uber.
NEUT14|The New Year's resolution stock to own in 2021 could have been written by Josh Brown, right?
BULL15|Yeah, this stocks going higher.
BEAR16|This was one of the toughest average downs I did in the March April.
BULL17|But it's one of the ones that rewarded me the most.
NEUT18|I think when we get into 2021 what people will be thinking about is 2022 numbers, because that's just the way these stocks trade.
NEUT19|If you think Uber in 21 is going to 18 billion in revenue and then 23 billion plus in 2022, which is Wall Street's consensus, then it's one of the cheapest.
NEUT20|Of the large cap technology growth companies like by far at a $96 billion market cap, it's like four 4 * 22 revenue.
BULL21|You got companies much bigger in terms of market cap trading a 20 and 30 times sales so I know we're grading on a curve, but I think this stock can absolutely work in the reopening.
NEUT22|They needed the vaccine.
BULL23|"Now we're getting it all right."""
