NEUT2|Please use your discretion in making investment decisions today.
NEUT3|We're going to talk about Facebook and its recovery after the.
NEUT4|Cambridge analytica.
BEAR5|The controversy and the data leaks and misuse of users data.
NEUT6|Buy Facebook.
BEAR7|That was the controversy, and that actually caused the.
BEAR8|How's the stock price go down from 184.52?
NEUT9|$152 during a time span of.
NEUT10|11 days studies it was around $185 on 16th March and on April on March 27th.
NEUT11|It was around $150.
BEAR12|Under $51.00, that's like around $24.00 or $34.34 dollars drop after that.
NEUT13|Mark Zuckerberg had to testify in front of the government officials and then give his side of the story.
NEUT14|And then there are multiple statements.
NEUT15|And admitting.
BULL16|That Facebook needs to improve the security.
NEUT17|Of users data and protect users.
BEAR18|From misuse of data.
BULL19|By others however, after that from 150.
NEUT20|Points on $5.
NEUT21|Yesterday which is.
NEUT22|Which is.
BULL23|8 May 2018 it came up 200 and $77178 actually went up to a high of firm.
NEUT24|100 and 7950.
NEUT25|But, however, these are the closing prices, so we can actually see at $178.
BEAR26|So coming down from 100 fifty $170.37.
NEUT27|That is $27.00 in a time of.
NEUT28|A month and 10 days around roughly 40 days.
BULL29|This is a good recovery and then whoever bought here when it went down $251.00 and then are up by $27.00.
BULL30|That was a good buy and given that WhatsApp is not yet monetized, Instagram is not monetized.
NEUT31|Oculus has not been monetized and Failbook is coming with a dating app and so on.
BULL32|There's a lot of potential for this stock to go up.
NEUT33|Facebook has zero debt.
NEUT34|That may and under revenue of around $40 billion.
NEUT35|If they come up with some kind of fine.
NEUT36|I mean, if even a government finds them for something.
BULL37|That will be only a blip in the short term, but in the long term this is an excellent.
NEUT38|Excellent stock, I bought this stock when it went down.
BEAR39|March 27th at around $152.
NEUT40|And I'm up to.
NEUT41|What happens tomorrow?
NEUT42|What happens a couple of years down the line we don't really know, but based on the information I have, I think it's a very good.
NEUT43|Stock and company.
NEUT44|Come.
NEUT45|That's all for now.
NEUT46|We'll see what happens in future.
NEUT47|Again, this is not a financial advice.
NEUT48|I'm not your financial advisor.
NEUT49|Please use your discretion in making investment decisions.
BULL50|"Thank you."""
