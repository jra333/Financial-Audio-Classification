NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
BULL1|Hope you having a good day back on the video.
NEUT2|This is will and make sure you guys leave a like comment below that subscribe button for that YouTube algorithm.
NEUT3|Help your boy out and today will be talking about FedEx so I have been looking at FedEx and I'll try to make this one short.
BULL4|FedEx has a good good opportunity because they recently had this big.
BEAR5|Drop OK so anytime I see a stock drop this big there's always good opportunities in there.
NEUT6|So I try to get key levels for you guys so you guys can have some potential good place.
NEUT7|So the first support level like I said if we saw this broke.
NEUT8|This was first support level and if it held that the next it would have been up here.
NEUT9|As you can see it broke that like we were expecting.
NEUT10|So you could take this level off.
NEUT11|See take this level off.
BULL12|OK, so like I said, it's a second support level for us to still stay bullish.
NEUT13|This is a second support level which is currently at and it is holding price so I said if it was at the second level you could get in around 268 level and you could probably get out around 273 'cause we do.
BULL14|Some do see some support in price right there.
BEAR15|As you can see it went very oversold, across the 40 and it is coming up.
NEUT16|So this the new first support level that I would see.
NEUT17|An if it breaks this level.
NEUT18|Which this is a key level.
NEUT19|I believe it will.
BEAR20|It will drop all the way down to around.
NEUT21|I believe price will go all the way down here.
NEUT22|So first support level.
NEUT23|If it breaks, that price will probably go around this area, but if it holds this, you could get a quick call option, maybe on Tuesday.
NEUT24|I probably did a quick call up call option if it holds this price.
NEUT25|Take a percentage of it out here, maybe half of it out here, and then I'll hold the rest until this second target right here.
NEUT26|So this is first support level 269.
NEUT27|First exit price 274, and then the rest of it can get out around 283.
BEAR28|But if it does break the 269 mark then I will be bearish on FedEx and I believe it's going to drop all the way around 265 between between 265 and 260 dropped.
NEUT29|If it passes this level.
BULL30|But if it holds this level for sure is a very key level, then I do think we will see higher prices on FedEx.
NEUT31|OK.
BULL32|So hope you guys like the video.
