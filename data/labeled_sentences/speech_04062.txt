BULL0|"""Hello guys, welcome back to my channel."
BULL1|So in this video I'm going to be talking about IGC, India globalization capital so this one had a pretty strong run up today.
BULL2|It kind of moved to high of.
NEUT3|$3.70 and then it basically couldn't hold it and then it kinda give back those gains.
NEUT4|So in terms of residences, the neck on the next restaurant is around 4:52, but if we go back quite a bit in time then we can see a few other residences on the stock.
NEUT5|One is at $5.46, another one at $5 and 82 another one at 770-6925 and 1459, so this one had a good number of residences and those kind of came from the last time it actually shot squeezed.
NEUT6|So that was where that information kinda came from.
NEUT7|This time it actually did not do that kind of a squeeze.
BULL8|It kind of went up.
NEUT9|Bye.
NEUT10|Like I said already 370 and then it cannot came and closed back.
NEUT11|Pretty.
NEUT12|Not so great, but this kind of looks like.
NEUT13|Yeah, so the important thing about this is basically it has a bearish pattern here which is called the bearish engulfing.
NEUT14|So this green candle is actually engulfed by this big red candle.
BEAR15|The whole of the body of the green candle is engulfed by the red candle, which basically is a bearish indicator on the stock.
NEUT16|So let's so when the price action or the previous candles are basically all going up and then you have a candle which is engulfing.
NEUT17|The are basically completely engulfing the body of the previous green candle.
NEUT18|Then it's called the bearish engulfing and this basically tends to trade towards the downside.
NEUT19|So let's see what kind of an action we get on this going into tomorrow.
NEUT20|So that's all I had for you guys on this talk.
