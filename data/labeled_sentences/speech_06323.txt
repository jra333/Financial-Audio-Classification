NEUT0|"""Is the future of entertainment led by a company who sells directly to consumers, or one that sells to bigger companies?"
NEUT1|We all know Netflix, the company that put blockbuster out of business and is now its own meme.
NEUT2|They created a radical new way for entertainment companies to do business, sell directly to you, the consumer.
NEUT3|At first they only let you binge watch old nostalgic shows and classic movies.
NEUT4|But now they produce stuff of their own.
NEUT5|Like a lot of stuff which costs them money.
NEUT6|Like a lot of money.
NEUT7|Like $8 billion for new shows and movies spent in a single year.
NEUT8|And we haven't even mentioned how much they spend a license shows from other companies like CW Discovery or AMC and over 117,000,000 people will happily pay that monthly fee to stream them all.
BULL9|Well, this earn Netflix over $11 billion in 2017.
NEUT10|Netflix still spends more than they make in 2017.
NEUT11|They spent about $2 billion more than they earned.
BEAR12|Whether it's your own personal bank account or a company's bank account, negative cash flows are never good.
NEUT13|But before you say WTF, just know the biggest companies in the world all did this at one time or another.
BEAR14|Losing money is bound to happen when creating a disruptive new way of doing business.
NEUT15|But what about the companies that sell their shows to Netflix and other streaming platforms and make their money without relying on you?
NEUT16|One in particular made $1.86 billion last year thanks to their addictive binge worthy content.
BULL17|And thanks to payments from not only streaming services, but cable providers and advertisers who run ads during their shows.
NEUT18|We're talking about Discovery, home of man versus Wild Shark week.
NEUT19|Can Fixer Upper Discovery also recently bought channels like Food Network and the Travel Channel.
NEUT20|Let's be honest, we've all binge watch those channels.
BULL21|A lot discovery stock has gone up 21% in the past three months, so that $1000.
NEUT22|You spent pampering yourself could have become $1210 towards retirement.
BULL23|Meanwhile, Netflix stock has gone up 125% in the last year, so that $1000 tax return you got last year.
NEUT24|Could have been worth $2250 today.
NEUT25|The big question is, is the future of entertainment led by a company that sells directly to us or one that sells to other big companies?
NEUT26|Because investing isn't about now, it's about the future in 20 years, which company will still be a thing?
NEUT27|Which company will be a bigger thing?
NEUT28|"A better thing?"""
