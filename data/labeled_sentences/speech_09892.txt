BULL0|"""But is there any amount of vaccine optimism, an recovery optimism that's going to lead you to revise your yield forecast higher?"
NEUT1|Well, you want to think about it now in a couple of ways.
NEUT2|From a expectation of inflation, right?
NEUT3|That would be a driver potentially of higher bond yields an we don't really see that as a as a key driver.
NEUT4|If you look at the building blocks of the measures of PCE, personal consumption expenditures, about 25% of that is coming from health care, whether it's health care services or pharmaceutical and and medications.
NEUT5|And the other probably 15 or 20% is coming from.
NEUT6|Housing and housing related aspects were not see a lot of inflation in those areas that would cause a major increase in bond yields are forecast for my colleagues in an interest rate strategy looking around 131.3 percent.
NEUT7|10 year U.S. Treasury yields faith by the end of 2020.
NEUT8|Once a year from now.
BULL9|So that's sort of modest increase, but not not dramatic.
NEUT10|And really, as you know, we've talked before on this on this program.
NEUT11|It's the pace to speed.
NEUT12|By which interest rates back up.
NEUT13|That would be a concern, so there's a magnitude that's obviously of interest and important, but it's really how fast that that that occurs, and if interest rates kind of go up gradually, the equity market is certainly can absorb that.
NEUT14|Yeah, David, it's Morgan.
BULL15|It's good to see you.
NEUT16|And just to dig into that a little bit more.
NEUT17|I mean, you're talking about that inflation outlook from your perspective into next year, but nonetheless with stocks near record highs right now.
NEUT18|I mean, fed liquidity has been a big part of the story.
NEUT19|If we do see this economic recovery vaccines begin to become much more mainstream next year.
NEUT20|What does that mean for fed and more broadly, central bank policy and all this liquidity in the market, especially given the fact that you do have this 4300 price target on SNP.
NEUT21|So the idea of the average inflation targeting framework that the Federal Reserve introduced would suggest that that they're going to be on hold for at least the next several years, somewhere between three years and maybe as long as five years.
NEUT22|Sort of depends.
NEUT23|That's a long time out there.
NEUT24|Let's just assume Morgan three years that you have.
NEUT25|You know, the policy rate staying really unchanged.
BULL26|That is supportive of economic activity.
NEUT27|I think that's the general thrust of the message from uh, from Jan and ourselves in terms of the equity market forecast is reasonably optimistic, and I think the way you attack this and you, will you invest in it, is sort of three ways.
NEUT28|There's the cyclicals, not a surprise there.
NEUT29|The easy or near term beneficiaries, you know, David and others have talked about that.
NEUT30|And then there's the value and values primarily in healthcare.
NEUT31|They are the cheapest.
NEUT32|Those stocks have been in 30 years on a relative PE the market.
BEAR33|Very, very attractively valued and we think about the historically they tend to underperform going into an election.
BULL34|Ultimately election in terms of Washington really hasn't been resolved won't be resolved until the early part of January 5th in the runoff in Georgia on ultimately we would expect there to be a rally in the healthcare sector, but ultimately this low rate environment is supportive of growth.
NEUT35|If you look out longer into 2021, do you think about how to cyclicals value and growth or three?
NEUT36|Projectors are three ways to kind of embrace, embrace, and invest in this market.
NEUT37|Shepard Smith here.
