NEUT0|"""SFM what is this Publix look at it now?"
NEUT1|The market cap guys is 2.5 billion people number one is PE ratio.
NEUT2|We want this less than 20.
NEUT3|Well we got one here.
NEUT4|A check mark here in Nine point nine Pillar #2 is profit margin.
BULL5|Over the past five years profit margin.
NEUT6|This is small.
NEUT7|It's 4%.
BEAR8|Grocery stores tend to have lower profit margins.
NEUT9|The gross margin hearing bad 37% Pillar #3 is revenue growth over the past five years.
NEUT10|Paul 3.64 point 404.
BULL11|4.75 point 25.6 so definitely a check mark there for revenue.
NEUT12|Pop out a profit growth pillar number four 129 one.
NEUT13|25158 One 58150 check Mark there it is growing #5 is the number of shares outstanding.
BEAR14|We want this number going down there 53 million down to 120 owning a million shares five years ago.
BULL15|Today is like only 1.2 million shares back that it's a positive sign we take their cash flow and buy shares that Pillar #6 is current assets greater than current liabilities.
NEUT16|They have 4 and 38 million in.
NEUT17|Essentially, cash on hand 510,000,000 in current liabilities, that it asks how about free cash flow.
BULL18|The granddaddy of them all free cash flow growth over the past five years, average 110 seventy One 10120 and 170.
NEUT19|That is the free cash flow in terms of billions of dollars every single year for last five years the average was 117,000,000 over the last five years.
NEUT20|So 117,000,000 * 20 is a little over 2.3 billion, so we're not far off now.
NEUT21|This is part of the start their new company.
NEUT22|They were founded in 2002 and I want to see.
NEUT23|How much of their growth is organic growth?
NEUT24|Meaning how much of the growth is coming from stores that are running around for over a year and how much their growth?
BULL25|Because they are opening more locations.
NEUT26|Their original business plan was for like 240 stores and that was it.
NEUT27|But once they go public, people want to see growth.
NEUT28|How do you see growth?
BULL29|You see faster growth by opening more locations.
NEUT30|It ended up not working for them.
NEUT31|They went bankrupt but some of the things you want to look at is how much of their growth is coming from new stores versus organic growth.
NEUT32|Paul, would you want to pull up the momentum chart here?
NEUT33|So guys remember to just recently crossed 200 day.
NEUT34|We want to look at it growing crossing over the three day moving average.
NEUT35|It happened here.
NEUT36|Dollars a share.
NEUT37|So if you bought it then you'd be in the negative right now, but the whole point is overtime.
NEUT38|Bought a handful of stocks when the Tour de goes over 3 today, and so when it goes below, you'd beat the market by about one one point 2% a year.
NEUT39|I think this stock to watch go do more research in terms of what their growth plan is, how their existing stores are doing.
NEUT40|How did they do during the downturn?
NEUT41|Natural stores tend to be more expensive, so economic downturn there might be more people pulling away from them and going for more value plays in terms of groceries.
NEUT42|So take a look at it.
NEUT43|I'm not opposed this one.
BULL44|This one looks pretty solid from a fundamental standpoint.
NEUT45|From the numbers.
NEUT46|"Now you gotta look at the story behind it."""
