NEUT1|Prime day.
NEUT2|Welcome to Beta Sierra News Powderpost Final Insider series brought to you by optimal this week on quick Roundup of news from the beta seaside of relationship marketing, we got a couple of new manifestations of just how important being considered an humanis for your business these days.
NEUT3|First, the Washington Post is reporting that Yelp will label businesses racist behavior, said it will put a business accused of racist behavioral health on pages in rare occasions to warn consumers even though some are worried that it could be misused.
NEUT4|Obviously, still the reason I chose to highlight this story here is that it makes one thing even clearer.
NEUT5|If you want to be ranked high on services such as Yelp, this is one more thing you're going to have to take into consideration.
NEUT6|Meaning, being extra cautious with how you treat theater.
NEUT7|Being sensitive, not tone deaf is anyway a great way to build relationships.
NEUT8|And #2.
NEUT9|We got sustainability, which is something that is good for the world.
NEUT10|Good for business.
NEUT11|Good for branding.
NEUT12|And now the Wall Street Journal is releasing its 100 most sustainably managed companies.
NEUT13|In the world ranking.
NEUT14|One thing I made it you notice we go, I'll show you the top ten was how and well how many N welcome American companies were ranked.
NEUT15|So here's the comparison.
BULL16|Western Europe got 35 companies in with an average rank of 43 E and Southeast Asia.
NEUT17|That one nine companies ranked 53 on average.
BEAR18|American companies finish less on in this comparison, both on quantity with 23 companies, an an average ranking which is 55.
BEAR19|With only two of the top 15 compared to 5 eastern and southeastern Asian companies.
NEUT20|And seven Western European ones.
NEUT21|What am I trying to say here?
NEUT22|I don't know that maybe a bunch of Netflix and Fox documentaries are probably feeling pretty vindicated right now.
NEUT23|And just one more thing.
NEUT24|We spoke about this from both relevant angles recently.
NEUT25|One about how Pepsi is going into functional beverages and two about the brand versus blend thing, right this whole conversation.
NEUT26|And now that Pepsi is relaxing beverage drift, well is out since a few weeks ago.
NEUT27|Marker from medium is analyzing the brand.
NEUT28|The branding of this new product.

NEUT30|Now we have an international giant doing blend by the book.
NEUT31|From the name to the fan to the product itself also, James Bowie is breaking down how it looks like when a conglomerate is doing the copycat thing.
NEUT32|And just two quick things here.
NEUT33|I wanted to go over one is this name.
NEUT34|Trademarks containing drift as percentage of all knew US trademarks over the last 20 years.
NEUT35|See the trend and same thing with well.
NEUT36|In the words of wise Al Bundy, all the Pepsi did here was to put their hands together.
NEUT37|The copycat 101.
