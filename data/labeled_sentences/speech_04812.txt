NEUT0|"""I'm Mark here at Simon Erickson and are stuck in the days MasterCard."
BEAR1|Shares are about even today after it announced that is going to be working closely with warehouse retailer Sam's Club to incorporate chip technology into new Sam's Club cards.
NEUT2|Simon, what's the deal here?
NEUT3|Yep, So what Sam's Club is doing is allowing MasterCard partner up with GE Capital to use EMV technology in the new credit cards.
NEUT4|India is a new chip and new technology that goes into credit cards makes it harder for.
BULL5|For criminals to steal identity, so it's a step up on the security front forum.
NEUT6|So why now?
NEUT7|Why are we suddenly changing to chip technology?
NEUT8|Because nobody wants to be the next target mark.
NEUT9|You know?
NEUT10|back in December we saw Target had 40 million customers.
BEAR11|Identity stolen, a huge security breach.
NEUT12|This is the next step to try to keep that from happening.
NEUT13|The thing is though, the real question is which retailers are going to take the stand of upgrading their systems to accommodate for these new technologies?
NEUT14|That's what's going to determine the future of these things.
NEUT15|OK, so is MasterCard just going to be raking in the dinero from this deal and.
NEUT16|Subsequent deals to come from this.
NEUT17|This is the next step.
BULL18|These are incremental wins.
NEUT19|You know, every every step is a little bit more security.
NEUT20|Which security is now the table stakes for any payment processor we see a lot of people trying to go after the $15 trillion a year of retail transactions on the planet.
NEUT21|You know everything from credit cards to PayPal to even things like Bitcoin, but the security state keeps getting higher.
NEUT22|This is the next step.
NEUT23|I like companies like Visa and MasterCard that are able to put some money behind this developed technology to keep security fraud from happening.
NEUT24|Alright, for Simon Erickson I'm Mark reef.
NEUT25|That's our stock of the day.
NEUT26|"We'll see you tomorrow."""
