NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbols EOM."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, a tricky charts talk about because it needs to break down until well cut.
NEUT5|Kind of a couple different ways.
BEAR6|If you're looking at just today, a very disappointing day looking at.
BULL7|Like you said only today, disappointing opening 30 minutes, big volume surge, absolutely fantastic.
NEUT8|Big green candle.
NEUT9|And then you know the rest of the story.
BEAR10|The price just faded off and drifted back down towards the rest of the day.
NEUT11|So that's what I see.
BEAR12|It doesn't mean today was bad or terrible, or a train wreck, but just very very very disappointing when you factor in just how strong things started off.
BEAR13|So yeah, today not a good day.
BEAR14|A very disappointing day.
NEUT15|However, let's now take a step back and look at things from a little bit bigger.
NEUT16|Picture point of view and from an overall standpoint, everything is still perfectly fine.
BULL17|The price is still up above that green line at $1.53.
NEUT18|In fact, that's right where the price bounce off of this morning.
NEUT19|So from that angle things it's not like the price came down there and then broke down through that level or anything like that would be much more.
NEUT20|You know, that would be much different conversation.
NEUT21|So overall, assuming you care about the bigger picture, everything's fine.
NEUT22|If you were a day trader for example, and you bought right there in your plan was by itself in seven minutes, will then from that perspective the chart does not look very good.
NEUT23|Are you at all?
BEAR24|And it's a very disappointing you know perspective on things.
NEUT25|So like I said, it all boils down to what was your actual game plan going in as far as key levels to watch moving forward that main area resistance remains right there.
NEUT26|At that purple line, the 50.
NEUT27|Moving average currently valued at $1.62 and then, if the price can push up through $1.62.
NEUT28|Next key level after that right up there, around $1.68.
NEUT29|So keep around those levels moving forward from the resistance side of things.
NEUT30|But overall yet today not a good day, but overall, the charts hanging in there, so let's see how this one plays out on Thursday.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live.
NEUT33|Revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
