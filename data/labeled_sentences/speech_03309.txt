NEUT0|"""I'm Alicia Kathy Aero, chief economist for Asia Pacific Athletics, is my key takeaway."
NEUT1|This week is turkeys.
BEAR2|Fallout Impact has been much larger than we had expected, including in Asia countries that you would imagine could have been insulated from an event in Turkey, but they have not and currencies have depreciated quite rapidly and the question is, will it continue?
NEUT3|Next week is really whether there would be a rebound.
NEUT4|Question is whether we see that.
NEUT5|Going forward to the rest of the universe, kind of, you know, this was just surprised and we're all heading back to better times, but I actually doubt it.
BEAR6|So I think what will be seen is that currencies will continue to weaken.
BEAR7|The renminbi has weakened further, which adds to the problems of the Turkish lira and we may see some governments hiking rates.
NEUT8|So actually central banks hiking rates.
NEUT9|So yes, that rebound that I wish would be happening next week might actually not be there and we still.
NEUT10|See a lot of volatility next week in the market, so looking further ahead we probably have to move away from Turkey to the trade war again so we know there's going to be Mission Vice Minister of Commerce.
NEUT11|Just announced that they will be heading to Washington for negotiations.
BEAR12|And of course they are short of time to negotiate because the 200 billion additional import tariffs.
NEUT13|To be imposed by the US come to fruit on the 31st of August.
NEUT14|Is this negotiation going to get somewhere or are we going to see additional measures being implemented by the US?
NEUT15|What will be the outcome?
NEUT16|"That's what we are waiting for."""
