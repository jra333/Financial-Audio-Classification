BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments today."
NEUT1|It's Thursday, February 11th and the market just closed.
NEUT2|In this video, I'm going to be talking about Neo ticker symbol Anio's.
BULL3|Over the past three days we had a good rally up.
NEUT4|We broke from.
NEUT5|This sideway movement between the 55 and the $59 range.
BULL6|We rallied all the way up to the 6450.
NEUT7|Where we encountered some resistance and bounced back down, and while it's doing that, if I switch here to the four hour chart.
NEUT8|One thing I notice is it looks like here we have around the bottom.
NEUT9|Touch.
NEUT10|Going down so it does look like a Cup and handle formation to get this confirmed we have to stay above the 20 email line which is represented by this red line.
NEUT11|So tomorrow if we stay above that price, which is roughly 59, let's say 5950.
BULL12|And we see some sort of movement to the upside in the afternoon tomorrow.
NEUT13|Then we could see this pattern confirming.
BULL14|An get the resistance of the 6450 tested again and hopefully we will finally have a breakout.
NEUT15|Initially I was thinking that maybe we have a double top forming.
NEUT16|And sometimes I know there's a lot there could be some confusion in terms of.
NEUT17|A double top or.
NEUT18|A Cup and handle.
NEUT19|Just because in the double top they both touch.
BEAR20|Upper prices and they come back down a bit.
NEUT21|But this does look more of a curved rounded bottom.
NEUT22|Rather than sharp.
NEUT23|Price movement like it a double top so watch out for this.
NEUT24|Level around the 5950 and let's see if it holds tomorrow.
NEUT25|If not, then we could see a rally back down and we could have this trendline get tested again and post an updated video tomorrow and see if we can get a confirmation on the pattern for me as usual.
BULL26|"Thank you all for watching and see you in the next video."""
