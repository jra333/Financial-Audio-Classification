NEUT0|"""But Big Fang names plus Microsoft."
NEUT1|You added to talk to me.
BULL2|We're seeing a significant Ro rotation as it relates momentum.
NEUT3|I've talked about that quite a bit.
NEUT4|The 1st place that is going to bottom is going to be the component of those momentum named, specifically growth technology and with the valuation is not astronomically high.
BULL5|The revenue growth is consistent and the capital allocation is present.
BEAR6|We are now four weeks away from hearing from these Mega cap technology companies about their earnings.
BULL7|I suspect the last quarter is going to be a very strong one.
NEUT8|But I felt the time was now to take the other side of what has been a significant narrative in moving away from all of technology.
NEUT9|I disagree with that.
NEUT10|I want the established growth.
NEUT11|I have positions in these three names and I have no problem increasing them, which I've done here over the last three days.
NEUT12|This is a call that these stocks, in particular the fangs, the mega cap technology stocks have become somewhat disconnected with the fundamentals, right?
BEAR13|I mean, the fundamentals have become disconnected with what the market has done.
BEAR14|The stocks have pulled back down a lot.
BEAR15|Joe Apples down 15 1/2% from it from its high.
BEAR16|The Amazons down 12 1/2% from its high Netflix 11 and a half alphabet five and a half Microsoft and Facebook for three, respectively, is that part of this call?
BEAR17|These stocks just came down too much.
BEAR18|Well, the the loss of momentum became the fundamental in the case of Apple, did we forget about the sales of iPhone 12?
BULL19|The introduction of this new product, which is going to be very strong, did we forget about the fact that China is expanding and opening their economy at a very significant capacity?
NEUT20|And so are the rest of the emerging markets.
BEAR21|So the loss of momentum that became the fundamental.
NEUT22|And I don't like that all right Dan Ives over at Wedbush puts a note out today.
NEUT23|By the way, gang on Apple calls, you know, talking about.
NEUT24|Super cycle, you know it's hard to get more bullish than that.
NEUT25|OK, jaanu Jerry.
NEUT26|And now I turn to you because you bought right?
NEUT27|A lot of Facebook calls, so it's the same kind of conversation we're having talked to me now.
NEUT28|Yeah, I agree, same kind of conversation as Joe.
NEUT29|The Facebook calls Scott.
NEUT30|They were buying calls from the 290 strike 292, fifty two 95303 oh five.
NEUT31|I mean everything they were buying like crazy.
BEAR32|You would have thought this was read it and maybe it is because many of those Reddit stocks like GameStop and AMC Scott are down pretty hard.
NEUT33|But this is reminiscent of that.
NEUT34|They are just buying, buying, buying.
NEUT35|And not turning him over.
NEUT36|But it's also big institutional buying an not to put the Reddit crowd down, but I like the big institutional buying more than I like the retail buying, but clearly there is a call out there where people are in their buying aggressively in Facebook.
NEUT37|Today, Pete talked about it already early this morning.
NEUT38|I had to join him.
NEUT39|I owned the stock before.
BULL40|I'm adding a lot of Facebook calls throughout the day, and some of these calls have already doubled.
NEUT41|Scott so.
NEUT42|Yeah, there's a lot of upside bets being placed, and some of that is of course with rates down stocks up and people are still looking at stocks like Facebook, not just the ones you mentioned.
NEUT43|"I won't rehash it about the corrections, but Facebook is one of them that just looks like it wants to break out to new highs."""
