NEUT0|"""Here is the game $3200 on our call contracts right here, hitting 6720 on the high."
BULL1|The equity prices up 3500.
NEUT2|Like I said right here.
NEUT3|Here's that breakout.
BULL4|We did come down right here and we made another high and we're at 95% level right here.
NEUT5|90% level.
NEUT6|The timestamp is 659.
BEAR7|We are 29 minutes into the opening Bell we just put in that high 615, which is $2.48 out of lower high than the previous day.
BULL8|There's that teeny right here at that teeny mathematical line, so we've had one pull back to pull backs and we continue to go higher.
NEUT9|We're at 97 over here and we continue to make that.
NEUT10|We're going to see if we can continue to come up and break them.
NEUT11|High rise, OK or not.
NEUT12|Eventually it's the 1st 30 minute bar.
BULL13|Half of a 60 minute bar on that 615 high so you know we'll keep adding to the positions and keep doing what we need to do here.
BULL14|"So that we can keep getting more exposure to Google."""
