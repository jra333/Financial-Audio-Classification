NEUT0|"""Scott, what are dividends and why don't all shares pay them?"
BULL1|Yeah, really good question mate.
NEUT2|So a dividend is most people think about the same as I think about interest from a bank or rent from a property.
NEUT3|It's the cash flows of the owner gets from what the what the asset is doing now.
NEUT4|It's cash in the bank.
NEUT5|Someone's paying you that interest to lend your money and you're getting a return on that.
NEUT6|If it's raining you know someone's living in the house.
NEUT7|Well, the unit they're paying you for the privilege.
NEUT8|In the case of dividends, you own a share or multiple shares of a company.
NEUT9|They're making a profit and then returning some of that profit to shareholders in the form of cash.
NEUT10|Because at the end of the day, there's only so much money that say Icba needs to run its business, all that spare cash.
NEUT11|No point keeping it on the books.
NEUT12|The custody owners share owners.
NEUT13|They want some of that money 'cause they want to return from their investment.
NEUT14|So a dividend is the cash portion of profits.
NEUT15|The company says it no longer needle.
BULL16|Can't you successfully, and therefore is happy to pay out to its shareholders?
NEUT17|So why don't all companies pay them?
NEUT18|Yeah, that's that's a better question.
NEUT19|So the company that makes a profit making hundreds profiteer, they've got a couple of questions.
NEUT20|But fundamentally, they come down to.
NEUT21|Do I use that money to grow my business?
NEUT22|What do I give that money back to shareholders?
NEUT23|They are the two questions now.
NEUT24|The answer that the question is people.
NEUT25|The companies don't give money back shells if they think they can use that money themselves to make the business even more worthwhile.
NEUT26|Most famously, Warren Buffett lost it in 1965 and ever since, because he said guys look if I keep this money.
NEUT27|I can compound it at a market bidding right?
NEUT28|If you're investing in my company, I assume you want that.
NEUT29|We also, yes we do please, and so they really buff it, keeps that cash and reinvested on behalf of the shells.
NEUT30|If they can find good uses for the money, better use the money that I can.
NEUT31|They should keep it in reverse in growing the business.
NEUT32|Amazon famously has not made much money, but reinvested all of its profits in top line growth, trying to become more dominant.
NEUT33|Overtime she holds a foregone those dividends.
BEAR34|I've got no cash flow from that business.
NEUT35|I own some shares, no cash flow at all, but I know that by reinvesting that money that profit.
BULL36|Jeff Bezos is making the company even more successful.
BULL37|Even more.
NEUT38|You know, larger in overtime, more profitable, because he's reinvesting that cash.
NEUT39|So if the company doesn't need the money or can't use the money successfully at a high rate of return, it should give it shareholders.
NEUT40|If it can use the money, particularly running loss.
NEUT41|And it needs that money simply to keep the business afloat, there's not going to pay dividends.
NEUT42|It's investing now for future returns down the track.
NEUT43|So in terms of investing strategy, it sounds like going for dividends or just going for growth for the investing in companies that don't pay a dividend sounds like it's completely different strategy, and there's no.
NEUT44|Right or wrong answer or approach?
NEUT45|I think that's fair.
NEUT46|I think you know.
NEUT47|Depends on which.
NEUT48|Also if you need to live off the income directly, you need those dividends.
NEUT49|That's the one extreme.
NEUT50|If you absolutely want to invest in hyper growth as much as I can get, and you don't want any dividends 'cause you don't invest in companies that don't want the cash you want to need that money to grow, there's a group in the middle though where you might invest in a company that pays a dividend.
NEUT51|But you might even reinvest that dividend back in the company to buy more shares, so there is a.
NEUT52|There is a midpoint.
NEUT53|Often we see numbers that up to half of the return from the major indices.
NEUT54|Overtime have come from reinvested dividends for example, so they can be a great source of compound wealth.
NEUT55|But depending as you sit on your individual strategy, there's a very big spectrum of where you might want to invest your cash.
NEUT56|The types of companies depend on the return you want and the way you wanna companion growth or take money out of that investment to fund your living expenses.
BULL57|Excellent thanks, God.
BULL58|"Thanks Ryan."""
