NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is Daniel sent today."
NEUT1|We're going to talk about protagonist after a few tricks with sticker PTG, X market cap of 390, seven $9 million negative income minus $77 million book to share 2.89 and the debt level are really allow here.
BEAR2|You can see PTG X Charter and it looks not really good.
BEAR3|We can sell it drop down from $20 to $8.00 in one day and now have some kind of.
BEAR4|Super Skyrocket ran to $16 from $6.
NEUT5|And we need to check it a little bit closer and this charter doesn't look like a pump and dump strategy.
NEUT6|It looks like they're going to some level like $15.
NEUT7|Here you can see a pipeline and the main run related to PTG 300 and they publish that there really close to find some Pharmaceuticals to treat.
NEUT8|Policy meteor Vera.
NEUT9|But really, I don't think that there really close to make my informative because they're only coming to phase two.
NEUT10|It is really strange that this stock reacting like this assets and liabilities.
NEUT11|And here you can see that they just burn around $20 million and you can see that.
NEUT12|Current assets 125 million and current liabilities 36 million and they write it in a 10K form that they can survive about two years without.
NEUT13|Any additional money and here you can see total stockholders equity burn like $20 million and now it's 62 million.
NEUT14|But the market couple around 400.
BEAR15|I think it is super strange and we can see that net loss per share growing from $0.58 to $0.72.
NEUT16|Here how that stock looks on that.
NEUT17|Gurufocus I think it is not really good and on a Yahoo finance you couldn't find any reasonable explanation.
NEUT18|Now why this talk are awesome and you have to hold it.
NEUT19|And as a resume I don't think that this talk is a yes to buy stalker or something like this because we don't have any fuel to go up there because they need lots of time.
NEUT20|To to make money from their Pharmaceuticals.
NEUT21|And I don't think that they will do something great in two years and they have money only for two years.
NEUT22|I will thinking about short the stock on Monday.
BULL23|I hope this video was helpful.
