NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|This is HH Trader back with another trader.
NEUT2|Talk recap video today was March or April the 6th and it was OK.
NEUT3|They took some trades on SJSJ was the only stock that I traded.
NEUT4|I didn't have to use too much money because it was so volatile, but let's go ahead and make sure we hit that like and subscribe button for more video content.
NEUT5|And let's get into it so only realized gains and losses here.
BULL6|And I realized gains and losses gained $2.62 per share.
NEUT7|That's where some of my ex is worth right now.
NEUT8|Of course, I had some really big gainers, but I also took some quite big losers, but these were on very small share size.
NEUT9|This was a 25 at enter.
NEUT10|25 shares got stopped out nine cents in the profit and then I entered 10 shares and just took on the way up.
NEUT11|So that's why the.
NEUT12|That's why the shares are looking like that.
NEUT13|These are very small trays because it was a $16.00 stuck or you know 15 sixteen $17.00 stuck.
BEAR14|So I did take some losers, two losers, but that's OK because we kept the majority of our profits today.
NEUT15|Usually a lot of times I have a habit of giving back profit because I trade with the same share size after I make a winning trade I need to start sizing down and then trading smaller, you know.
NEUT16|But anyway, on my on my transactions here we can see added four buys 1234 bys today and on my balance is this is where we left off.
BULL17|I did give let back a little bit of profit, but overall 23 bucks isn't bad so we will take that.
NEUT18|I think that is it SJ, whereas traded it at traded right.
BEAR19|OK so it was holding the web here and I got stopped out on their first 25 shares right in here and then I re entered for this upward push going up here into the halt.
NEUT20|Then when it opened up I still had a shares that I was Ek sitting right in here and then it started to fade.
NEUT21|So that was my trade for today.
NEUT22|And I didn't even use all of my all of my equity.
NEUT23|I started today with $900 to trade and I used $600 to make that 25.
NEUT24|So I guess you can say that's a lot of risk $16600.
NEUT25|But there it was.
NEUT26|Managed risk on each trade.
NEUT27|But that is it.
