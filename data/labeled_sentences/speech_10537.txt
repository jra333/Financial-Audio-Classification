BEAR0|"""Now I one of the most disappointing things today is J&J because this one person is sick and we hope that one person just comes out of it."
NEUT1|But J&J does not make any money off the vaccines.
NEUT2|Everybody they make money off their company and I think people should recognize that drugs were really fantastic.
NEUT3|The healthcare business of people, they don't use a lot of e-commerce, they really need to get back in that Channel.
BULL4|But it's real good.
BEAR5|But the pause remember is not a whole, it's an adverse effect.
NEUT6|We hope they know something.
NEUT7|In the next couple of days, David, you know who was able to talk a stock up better than the Robin Hood.
NEUT8|People who Disney?
NEUT9|Yeah wait, wait, are we moving on from JJ already?
NEUT10|'cause I wanted a favor report no no no but Jim you know they have a similar delivery of the vaccine payload.
NEUT11|They used the Idina virus to deliver the vaccine payload again I'm.
NEUT12|I'm no expert on this stuff, but that's what Astra Zeneca also does, and so they had that a case of transverse myelitis we don't know yet for Seneca now.
BEAR13|They've resumed the Astra Zeneca trials everywhere, but in the United States where they haven't, we don't know, and so there might be some concern there.
NEUT14|Jim, if this is, we don't know what it is, but if this is another case of that, is it related somehow to the way that the vaccine payload is delivered to figure out whether it's the age?
NEUT15|I said this is the person with the person having the ***** Bow.
NEUT16|Well, we don't know, so you're not getting any answers.
NEUT17|I'm getting no answers which David frankly, we get no answers.
NEUT18|You feel great, right?
NEUT19|So but listen will see because it worst case it does.
NEUT20|It may be somewhat concerning in terms of 100, those two.
NEUT21|Yeah, those two vaccines, not the M RNA stuff, not Pfizer Moderna.
NEUT22|Not what you want to do, another one, no, why not?
NEUT23|I don't know, I'm not.
NEUT24|I'm not focused on getting in a vaccine.
NEUT25|Why not wait?
NEUT26|I got rejected by J&J just like I I I'm steroid shot in my arm that was the end of that.
NEUT27|But again Jim, we are going to get a Pfizer.
NEUT28|We're probably going to get results from the Pfizer trial that could be before the end of this month.
NEUT29|Could be any day.
NEUT30|Santa Fe is really going to be big, yeah, and people.
NEUT31|It's you gotta be in these 'cause otherwise I might have changed and are people in hot spots?
NEUT32|Well you don't have to worry about it.
BULL33|'cause we got spots all over again.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
