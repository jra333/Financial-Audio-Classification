NEUT8|So let's get started on today's picks for Wednesday.
NEUT9|Alright, real pages, so real pages is a cloud based solution for a real estate industry.
NEUT10|I didn't know this, but basically they rallied from 46 to 56 and they are that.
NEUT11|Everybody wants them to keep going up.
NEUT12|So our model also really likes it.
BULL13|11.36% and this could be something that you guys could get into and see some good profit.
BULL14|Alright UnitedHealthcare Super super safe.
BULL15|They just got an upgraded Zacks rank of number.
BULL16|Two, so this should be pretty good and this is easy money to make at 3.56% profit gain in an get out of United Healthcare.
NEUT17|OK so Sunopta STK.
BEAR18|Also STK L is basically a consumer staple stock and then they that whole sector is lost 3.83%.
BULL19|An SD Cal has returned 182% this year so our model likes it at 6.47%.
BULL20|So there's still some upside there and you guys can still get in.
NEUT21|Alright, Domino's.
NEUT22|Am I am I the only one keeping Domino's alive like I don't think so.
NEUT23|I think we're all fat ***** and we're all eating Domino's.
NEUT24|So let's just go ahead and get into this one at 8.31% and.
NEUT25|You know, make some quick money and super super safe to get into that one.
NEUT26|Alright MRNSOMRNS, it's a pharma.
BULL27|They've already rallied.
NEUT28|I think like I don't know, bajillion percent maybe 50% at this point.
NEUT29|And you know, sometimes when we see that there's still some some more juice there.
NEUT30|So we saw that with zoom and pellet on.
BEAR31|We kept getting in and out of those because there's just still room.
BULL32|There are model does not see a lot of growth there at 1.32%.
NEUT33|And it's also a $3 stock, so it's super risky.
NEUT34|I would say stay out.
NEUT35|OK, we did today's picks pretty fast today.
BULL36|I want you guys to get back into the market and take advantage of the day.
BULL37|It looks like Nasdaq's down today Dow's doing OK, and we'll see what tomorrow brings.
NEUT38|Think we had a decent fed bad meeting.
NEUT39|I don't.
NEUT40|I don't know the news on that yet, but you know, I think everybody was kind of looking at that to know the direction of the market this morning, and it was pretty pretty fine up until just a little while ago, so we'll see what tomorrow holds.
NEUT41|"Alright, you guys get after it by."""
