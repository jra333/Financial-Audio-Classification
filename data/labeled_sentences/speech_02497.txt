NEUT0|"""Disney proving that anything can happen when you wish upon the right star or succeed in buying the bulk of Rupert Murdoch."
BULL1|Media Empire stock, rallying 6% in the last month.
BULL2|Now up for nine straight Days's longest winning streak in five years.
NEUT3|So is the magic back for the Mouse House guy.
NEUT4|She's cracking up 'cause Pete and I are singing.
NEUT5|Upset based on where you are, there you go back to the trade?
NEUT6|Coincidence or not Mel?
NEUT7|When they would legalize sports gambling?
NEUT8|If you recall was I do.
NEUT9|Disney was trading either side of $100.
NEUT10|We had a conversation on the desk.
NEUT11|This might be the catalyst.
NEUT12|Might be what saves ESPN.
BULL13|We got bullish on Disney 15% later.
NEUT14|Here we are.
NEUT15|Is there room to the upside?
NEUT16|Still?
NEUT17|I believe so.
BULL18|Especially as we get into earnings season so I think they've staved off the death knell that they appeared to be in.
NEUT19|And I think this gambling thing was to eat.
NEUT20|Now I know we can talk about, Comcast and Fox News.
NEUT21|All, I don't think that's got anything to do with it.
NEUT22|I think it's all in the back that is a little something little.
NEUT23|Oh yeah, I think you're right though.
NEUT24|I mean, we talked about that day when we talked about this could I?
BULL25|Don't know if it necessarily saves ESPN, but it certainly is a great lifeline for ESPN and actually maybe extends forward.
NEUT26|But the idea of what they're going to get from this deal, I think, and I don't know, that they even had to overpay as much as everybody's got an opinion on that whole thing.
NEUT27|They get star from India.
NEUT28|They get that big chunk of Hulu.
BULL29|Those are assets that I think will really mesh well with what Disney is trying to do.
NEUT30|Anybody have thoughts on how Comcast traded today?
BULL31|Got an upgrade today.
BEAR32|It dropped its bid.
NEUT33|Not going to engage in a bidding war in the stock is back to April levels, you know.
NEUT34|Actually, if you're Comcast, you have to compete for these assets right?
NEUT35|And drive up the price as much as you can from your key competitor and then now they go back and they are focused on this international expansion, which was really what they had already decided to do months and months and months ago.
BULL36|So to me, I think Comcast is good in shape, but I think they did everything that they should have.
NEUT37|And they did not overpay for other than overpay for the assets that everybody says they're going to look for next Sky.
BEAR38|They're going to overpay.
NEUT39|Or no, I don't know.
NEUT40|I don't work for a company well.
BULL41|To compete against themselves on this, I mean they certainly played a great game of chess here, so stock reacted.
NEUT42|I think fairly well the way it should have today.
NEUT43|I still go back to.
NEUT44|I think all of these people should be looking into the E, gaming, or esports if you will.
NEUT45|That to me is the growth area for the entire media sector.
