NEUT7|So now let's talk about Amazon AMZN.
NEUT8|Here is a very very good looking top in here.
NEUT9|First you could see the broadening pattern, or that megaphone being formed.
NEUT10|It's gets up to 100% FIB extension that 100% FIB extension comes off of this last cycle right?
NEUT11|In here.
NEUT12|So what we do is we build that off of this big cycle here and IT projects to this level here.
NEUT13|That's in some hindsight, I didn't really project for it to get up there and just at the patterns do project that.
NEUT14|That would be a good place for it too.
BEAR15|Stop and roll over or these were big earnings miss.
BEAR16|I mean they really have issues in here and the cost of getting set up to be the provider of food and everything else for this stay at Home World.
NEUT17|Well this was the star right?
NEUT18|They were doing the best of everybody but their costs in order to change their model to be able to accommodate that were massive and they're talking about the cost being.
BEAR19|Even bigger in Q2, so $4 billion in additional costs that they believe that they're going to face between who they have to hire, how they have to run these distribution centers.
BEAR20|It's an enormous cost, and the stock, in our opinion, is going lower.
BEAR21|We're going to project it at a best case in the near term here, down to about 2150, but it could be a lot worse than that.
BEAR22|I mean, they're going to be anticipating really bad earnings numbers as a matter of fact, they could or nothing in the next quarter based on what they have to do.
NEUT23|To run their business, they're really suggesting that they're having those troubles, and then, of course, with Basil spitting, getting called in front of Congress.
BEAR24|The stock is down 200 points today, 7.7%.
BEAR25|It's a bad day.
NEUT26|This is a weekly chart you're looking at in.
BEAR27|It's going to be a bad quarter out there.
NEUT28|"We think the top is in on this stock and that it is a short."""
