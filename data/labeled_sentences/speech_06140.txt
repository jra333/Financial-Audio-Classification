NEUT0|"""Feed by being visible doing with the Federal Reserve has done recently and basically coming out and saying look, this is what we're doing."
NEUT1|This is our plan.
NEUT2|Might just help the Republicans stay in office in November.
NEUT3|But how about the other side of the coin?
NEUT4|How about as we see this wealth effect that we talked about earlier come through where the stock market maybe takes another bump because corporations are buying back their stock and now then the liberals come in.
NEUT5|They said well what the heck is going on here?
BEAR6|You know there's a bigger and bigger disparity between the classes?
BEAR7|That's not good.
NEUT8|It's kind of a tightrope.
NEUT9|They have to walk is between now and election time.
NEUT10|Isn't it kind of sort of true?
NEUT11|Well, I think when people are beginning to feel, which is one reason why you'd never know it from the media.
NEUT12|The temperature of the country is going down a tad and not on the extremes.
NEUT13|But people are saying, by golly, this might be for real.
NEUT14|And when things are going well for you, it's harder to get mad and stay mad.
BULL15|So so things are going well, so you think that as long as they can maintain some momentum, things look good in November.
NEUT16|The American people are not envious.
BULL17|They don't care if Bill Gates is going to make another 10 billion or basil is going to make another 50 billion if their prospects are improving, they can see they're going to earn more.
BULL18|They're going to get a better job.
NEUT19|They are happy they want their fair share, and that's in their pursuit of happiness.
NEUT20|And I salute Lee and I'd like I'd like to.
NEUT21|I'd like to think of all Americans that way and I like to think of specially our income generation viewers as being very fair minded in trying to do the greater goods.
NEUT22|So Speaking of that, you stay with us.
NEUT23|We'll be right back with many more words of wisdom.
NEUT24|From our good friend Steve Forbes.
NEUT25|"They will be right back."""
