NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this."
NEUT1|Be a video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, as we head into the weekend here, want to get Amazon updated?
NEUT6|'cause there's an interesting pattern here that's taking shape and I'm very curious to see how the price behaves with it going into next week.
NEUT7|And I should note that this is not some sort of great discovery on my part.
NEUT8|I'm not trying to come across like I have some sort of unique ability to have done this.
NEUT9|In fact I the exact opposite.
NEUT10|I assure you, people that you start to understand charts have taken notice of this pattern.
NEUT11|They're going to watch in the exact same thing, which is important because when a lot of people are watching the same areas and wondering the same things, call it a self filling prophecy cover you want it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT12|And that's exactly what we have going on here.
NEUT13|So the first part of this pattern is the resistance trendline, which is just illustrating the gap between Thursday and then today.
NEUT14|Friday.
NEUT15|It's very clearly there are some spend some selling pressure that is shown up selling pressure in the form of wall higher or excuse me lower hot lower highs and that's you know.
NEUT16|So when I say selling pressure, I don't mean in the sense of and therefore this thing is going to crash back down to 2000.
NEUT17|I'm not saying that I'm just saying it's very straightforward, that yeah, you have these lower highs represented by that red line.
NEUT18|So that does represent some selling pressure that's taking place now.
NEUT19|That also brings about.
NEUT20|Nothing is guaranteed, but the more than valid, rational and thought process of OK. Well, if the price does work its way up there and get it's a breakthrough that red line that in of itself could create quite a bit of upside buying pressure.
NEUT21|And that's absolutely right again, not guaranteed to happen, but by no means is that some sort of random thought that doesn't have any sort of, you know, rationale behind it.
NEUT22|It totally does, so that's going to be a level that, again, a lot of people will be watching in that part of the pattern.
NEUT23|And then as far as the support part of the pattern.
NEUT24|That stands out is down here at this area of the 3230 Mark.
NEUT25|So you go through the history of things and you can see that right now, maybe, just maybe, some sort of pattern like this is going to form and then it becomes a question.
NEUT26|OK well, which way is the price?
NEUT27|Also meaning break is the price going to break out to the upside or is the price going to get the breakout to the downside?
NEUT28|But like said more of the story, I think a lot of people are going to be watching both these areas from the support side of things and then that resistance side.
NEUT29|Now of course the shorts are going to be more interested in that level.
NEUT30|The logs and breakout players will be more interested in that level.
NEUT31|But I think those would be the main areas to watch moving forward, so let's see what happens with that.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird.
NEUT37|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT38|But in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
