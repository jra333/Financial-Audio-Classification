BEAR0|"""The history of Alzheimer's trials is so fraught and there have been hundreds upon hundreds of failures in this category."
NEUT1|Investors really should have known better.
NEUT2|You know any trial can work by random chance.
NEUT3|But blaming Biogen for the results of today?
BEAR4|Hard for me to do that now.
NEUT5|Should Biogen have had a better backup plan in place when this fell apart?
NEUT6|That's a much more open question.
NEUT7|I think a more interesting debate and why it was so much at stake on this particular trial, especially for this company.
NEUT8|Well, I mean, Biogen has a lot of products on the market.
BULL9|There market leaders in some key categories, multiple sclerosis, spinal muscular atrophy competition is heating up in both those areas.
BEAR10|And Biogen now suddenly has a growth problem on its hands.
BEAR11|Multiple sclerosis has been slowing down their largest best selling drug faces a patent challenge of Biogen loses that, you know that's going to make things worse.
NEUT12|Novartis is going to hit the market with its gene therapy drug.
NEUT13|You know, maybe this year.
NEUT14|Maybe next year.
BULL15|That's going to be a serious challenger to SPINRAZA Biogen's main growth driver, so this could get this.
BEAR16|Could be a serious problem for Biogen going forward and they spend about $12 billion in the last four years buying back stock.
NEUT17|And now there are real questions about the pipeline of new drugs coming in.
BULL18|That's a great point.
NEUT19|So who else Charlie has promising research in this area for people looking at what may treat or cure Alzheimer's?
NEUT20|It's can't out there.
NEUT21|It really is.
BEAR22|And this is a sad day for Alzheimer's patients and for taxpayers.
NEUT23|Treating long term care liabilities is everyone's problem.
NEUT24|Whether or not you know someone with this disease and you know, I think any promising Alzheimer's treatments are years away and we have to reset the Clock again.
BEAR25|And that's a bummer.
NEUT26|And you said here, there's a few other companies where maybe investors should look to accadia Neurocrine Sage which just had treatment yesterday for postpartum depression.
NEUT27|Sure, sure, I mean Biogen's been focused on central nervous system disorders, and none of these companies have.
BULL28|Need Alzheimer's asset, but at the same time they are with fit within Biogen strategy and will be a natural.
NEUT29|You know Tuck in acquisition at the same time Biogen might need to rethink whether central nervous system is the place it wants to be.
NEUT30|I think I think when you see a move like this, you really have to ask some bigger questions about what you're doing.
NEUT31|Are they in play now Charlie, or because of the sell off?
NEUT32|Or no, because of the pipeline issues, it's possible it's possible.
BEAR33|I mean, Celgene was similarly down in the dumps and got bought out for a higher price than Biogen's market value today.
NEUT34|But you know, just because that's happened once does not mean that.
NEUT35|Every viable exit strategy for every company as you can.
BEAR36|As you can see the Celgene Bristol Myers deal is also hotly contested.
NEUT37|Exactly.
NEUT38|So yeah.
BEAR39|"I mean, I think someone could make a play for Biogen, but I think their shareholder base could could raise some objections if that happened."""
