BEAR0|"""Trading on the Shanghai Stock Exchange was suspended today after shares fell more than 7% suspended a little tomorrow."
NEUT1|We'll see what happens then.
NEUT2|Mike McKenzie.
NEUT3|Our markets editors here to talk about it.
BEAR4|Not a great start to the year from our end.
NEUT5|Mike, how's it going to play out?
BEAR6|Well, it's it's looking pretty ugly here because a lot of people when you begin the new year, think classic trading strategies are by last year's underperforming stocks.
BEAR7|Sort of the dogs of the Dow theory and right out of the gate first trading day of the year with this big drop in Chinese shares.
BEAR8|We also had the currency being set at its lowest level in four years against the dollar and the room.
BEAR9|Then B is then in turn affected sentiment in commodities.
BEAR10|So for example, earlier this morning we had oil up over 3% on the Saudi Iran tensions and suddenly oil lost all of its gains because some animals focusing now on China's stock market, weakening the currency, weakening that feeds through this fear of deflationary contagion that then goes into commodities.
BEAR11|And if you look at the worst performing stocks today on the Footsie 100.
NEUT12|It's all the big miners.
NEUT13|And Standard Chartered which is also seen as being exposed to China.
BEAR14|Now if you look at their one day performance today, their stocks are down significantly anywhere from 4 to about 7%.
NEUT15|If you look at what they did last year.
BEAR16|Again, although today's worst decliners were last year's worst decliners, so it is.
NEUT17|Although we flipped the Calendar, nothings really changed here.
NEUT18|There doesn't seem to be a moment to buy into the dip, does it?
NEUT19|The dip seems to go on dipping.
NEUT20|I mean, when is it going to stop?
NEUT21|Well, that's the old truism.
NEUT22|You know, no one wants to catch a falling knife and at the moment I think if you're looking at the commodity.
NEUT23|China related emerging market related areas of markets in general, investors are sort of saying I, they're still not cheap enough for me to come in and buy an that is becoming a concern because you would expect to see some kind of.
NEUT24|You know interest by investors, but if they're holding back, it could mean maybe the bigger fund redemptions are coming.
NEUT25|They're just trying to hold as much cash as possible.
BEAR26|We also have yet to hear from any of the big central banks this year, and that's going to create a lot of volatility.
NEUT27|You mentioned central banks, we know what the Fed did last month, but we still don't really know what it's going to do this year.
NEUT28|Doing what that's going to say to markets over the course of the year.
BEAR29|Yes, and again you've got this great standoff, which has been playing out for last few years.
BULL30|the Fed is saying we're going to raise rates by at least.
NEUT31|Four times this year, markets saying you'll be twice if you're lucky now, that could potentially shift either way.
NEUT32|Now, obviously if the Fed only ends up raising rates twice and meets the markets expectations, then volatility should be contained.
BULL33|If, on the other hand, though, you do see lower oil prices, finally push up consumer spending in the US and economy really starts to pick up and they are having a reasonably warm winter.
NEUT34|So again, consumers aren't getting hit by rising energy costs or rising home heating costs.
BULL35|There could be some pent up demand coming through the US economy in the first quarter of this year.
BEAR36|That could really upset the bond market, and again, you can sort of see this various markets.
BEAR37|You're seeing a lot of uncertainty and a lot of fear and potential for some pretty unpleasant outcomes.
BULL38|Alright, great start to 2016.
BULL39|"Thanks very much and thanks."""
