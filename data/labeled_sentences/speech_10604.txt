NEUT0|"""David, a blue wave means her."
BEAR1|A lot of people short and cover whenever election night really ends because there's a lot of stocks in a blue wave that would be crimped or despised by a hijack of the far left, by which you mentioned you mentioned that on squawk.
NEUT2|So is that your new thing?
NEUT3|Are you concerned about that?
NEUT4|Yes.
NEUT5|OK, hijacked by the far left.
NEUT6|Well, that sounds like the language of the of the Republicans know it's a narrative.
NEUT7|It's not looking Davidson narrative.
NEUT8|You're going to hear what I go with.
NEUT9|What I'm going to hear all day from people and they would say was hijacked by the far left mean.
NEUT10|It's not going to happen right away, or is it going to take?
NEUT11|We don't know this, who knows when we got the election counted, but you know, you short the managed care stocks right into a blue wave.
BEAR12|The managed care stocks then dropped 10% and you buy the managed care stocks leading with Centene and maybe United Health there.
NEUT13|I gave your game plan.
BEAR14|David Pfizer goes down to 32 ahead of the election, drops to 31 1/2 people think they've made a lot of money.
NEUT15|You buy Pfizer.
NEUT16|This is what you do all right.
NEUT17|I just gave it to you.
NEUT18|OK, you can go to your thing.
NEUT19|I don't know whatever that anger is that you're doing.
NEUT20|I'm Tiffany.
NEUT21|Nobody go to typing, do the Tiffany and the other whatever then, but I've just given you how to make real money this real month.
NEUT22|Thank you.
NEUT23|I'm going to watch for that.
NEUT24|Hijacking scary by the way, we don't even have a clue how the elections can actually turn out.
NEUT25|Jim, there's plenty of people despite the polls, who believe that the Republican that Trump is going to win?
NEUT26|Well, I just I'm saying that the current site Geist is to bet Blue Wave.
BULL27|I've learned enough call.
NEUT28|What did I learn in 2016?
NEUT29|You don't know what you're talking about.
NEUT30|If you're predicting, particularly because the way to get hold of older voters when you're polling.
NEUT31|Is going, I mean it's just not like you dial the home number anymore.
NEUT32|Yeah, I mean, JP Morgan had a note yesterday talking not about blue wave or no blue wave, but whether it's a light blue wave or a dark blue wave and part of their point.
NEUT33|Jim was that undecideds undecided at this point or 3% in 2016, it was 11%.
BEAR34|At this stage it's the lowest number since the 40s.
NEUT35|So Joyce Chang's desk of either argument is that the polls are not going to be any worse of a predictor than they were four years ago.
NEUT36|This cerulean blue, like kind of like our Blues.
NEUT37|We have very pretty, but I think that was.
NEUT38|There's a whole another cohort of people who say come Tuesday night Punchable stay late and really won't mean anything because Pennsylvania just got permission to vote whenever the hell wants to.
BEAR39|An Pennsylvania is obviously nervous.
NEUT40|Hell it wants to, well, I mean, didn't you see the Supreme Court sided?
NEUT41|I believe though everything's gotta actually be postmarked prior to Election Day, but there's kind of a more leeway than we've ever had.
NEUT42|You have a bunch of conversations this morning with some of your friends over on DC.
NEUT43|I always talk to people, he said.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
