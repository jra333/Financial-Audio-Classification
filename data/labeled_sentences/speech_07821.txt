NEUT0|"""20705 is the high tech of the day, an Apple for the first time in History Company is worth $1 trillion."
NEUT1|Morgan said a few moments ago historic moment, but to see this happen after talking about it for so many years is amazing.
BULL2|He cleared it by 3/4 of percent, at least right now.
NEUT3|So I mean, I think the question here is obviously everyone agrees.
NEUT4|It's just kind of a number out there in space, but it does represent the economic heft of a company in the markets.
NEUT5|Assessment of its future.
NEUT6|And the question here is, does it start to feel like a culmination moment or is it just kind of a stop along the way and you know it's going to be just this line out there that you have three or four other companies that really can see on the horizon right now?
NEUT7|And of course, does it actually close above it?
NEUT8|Yes, that's another.
NEUT9|More immediate question, absolutely.
NEUT10|I think that now that we've had a trigger.
NEUT11|I just kind of thinking like what would Steve Jobs be saying right now, and I think he would probably not say much.
NEUT12|He might smile, but it would be very proud.
NEUT13|That's the first thing that I I think of today that he brought this company back from the Brink 20 plus years ago and just created a company that has a culture that really wants enrich people's lives.
NEUT14|And I think like it, it might sound.
NEUT15|I'm not like a little off topic here, but I think that that is really at the core of what has happened here.
NEUT16|They have these products that value the experience, the privacy, and so I guess my initial thought is just thinking about what would Steve Jobs say right now and separately is I think there's a lot more to go in this story.
NEUT17|I think that this could be is this story could be two or three times bigger and in the next decade than it is today.
NEUT18|Because of this gift that's going on to Apple as a service, not just the services.
NEUT19|Business, but their hardware business operating like a service.
NEUT20|This catch that they're going to be getting back.
BULL21|"I think that this, even though we're past this psychological point, I think that there is significant upside to the stock going forward."""
