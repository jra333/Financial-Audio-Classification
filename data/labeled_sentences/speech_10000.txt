NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, today we're talking about how to buy and sell stock on the thinkorswim mobile app."
NEUT1|Now I'm using an iPhone today so if you're using an Android device or a tablet, it's going to look a little bit different.
NEUT2|The first thing we need to do if we're going to buy stock is pull up a symbol now to do so I can either click on the quick quote box at the top of the page and enter the symbol if I know it, or I can just go straight from my watch list and click on a symbol there.
NEUT3|In this case, I'm going to click on Johnson and Johnson on my watch list.
NEUT4|It'll bring up Johnson and Johnson now to place a trade.
NEUT5|I'm going to click on trade in the upper right portion of the page.
NEUT6|Notice on the trade page, I have the opportunity to buy or sell.
NEUT7|I've the opportunity to change it from a limit order to a market order or some other type of order.
NEUT8|I can change the quantity, I can change the limit price or whatever price I want.
NEUT9|I can change the time in force from data good till cancelled, but once the order is to my satisfaction, I click on confirm in the upper right portion of the page.
NEUT10|I can review the order and then send that order in order to buy it.
NEUT11|Now if I'm going to sell, I can either go through the same process, or it's likely that you're going to want to sell an existing position.
NEUT12|That's going to be under your positions page.
NEUT13|So I'm going to click on positions.
NEUT14|For our example today, let's sell our Apple stock, so I'm going to click on Apple.
BEAR15|And it brings up my Apple position.
NEUT16|I can click on cell or I can just click on close position.
NEUT17|So it gives me a choice to sell my 100 shares of Apple or I can sell it with a stop or with a bracket order of some sort.
NEUT18|In this case, we're just going to sell my 100 shares of Apple by clicking on cell minus 100 Apple.
NEUT19|And it puts a check mark next to it, and then I can click on close.
NEUT20|It loads up the order again.
NEUT21|I can change the order fields.
NEUT22|I can change limit to market.
NEUT23|I can change the quantity.
NEUT24|I can change the limit price or the time in force, but once the order is to my satisfaction, I click on confirm.
NEUT25|I can review the order and when I want to, I'm going to click on send in the upper right portion of the page.
NEUT26|And it notifies me that the order was sent.
NEUT27|That's how you buy and sell stock on the thinkorswim mobile app.
