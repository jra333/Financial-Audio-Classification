NEUT0|"""But it doesn't stop at piggybacking."
NEUT1|You got a whole contingent traders who are trying to front run Ark.
NEUT2|As I mentioned earlier last week, we learned that Kathy Woodner team or launching a new ETF focused on space exploration.
BULL3|In response, all the high profile space stocks soared higher, presumably in the expectation that arcs to ETF would be bar and they can toss it to the ATF Virgin Galactic.
BULL4|The extremely early stage commercial space tourism play, so its stock jumped 20%.
NEUT5|There were similar moves in Maxar technologies, ViaSat Iridium Orbed.
NEUT6|Com all because Kathy Woods new Fund might be interested in them, maybe, but the darn fun doesn't even exist yet.
BEAR7|So these trades feel like a recipe for disaster.
BULL8|All told, these five space stocks are up 29% on average year to date.
NEUT9|That makes it tough for Ark to get a good entry point once this new ETF launches because everybody front ran, Kathy would so now would and her team are coming under fire for all sorts of these greybeards or after you know that people come on and they say that frog people are like frogs that boil 'cause they're buying stocks whatever.
NEUT10|People get nervous when they see a fun with such incredible performance Baron speech yesterday made some good points about the law of large numbers.
NEUT11|Can't manage 47 billion the same way you manage 3 billion.
NEUT12|This sceptical Wall Street Journal article just last week, which compared Ark to one of the hottest mutual fundsofthe.com era.
BULL13|Janice after racking up huge wins in stocks like Cisco and AOL, the Teslas in the 90s the.com bubble burst in.
NEUT14|Janice is funds that obliterated.
NEUT15|I don't know if it's the right comparison or not, but it's good to have historical and have it in your mind.
NEUT16|Well I don't think Mark is the next Janis that would be too harsh.
NEUT17|I also wouldn't count on them to continue to deliver all inspiring returns year after year, especially after publishing their what they're buying.
NEUT18|Don't get me wrong, Kathy Wood is legitimately brilliant, but she and her team have to keep finding new winners and it'll be a lot harder to find them at to buy those stocks at reasonable prices.
BEAR19|'cause there's so many copycats.
NEUT20|And by the way, the people like you look at Wallstreetbets or Robin, they keep taking and taking another, they'll they'll take her in front of for Palantir.
NEUT21|They confront from GameStop.
NEUT22|They're doing an AMC now they just have a bed, bath, and beyond.
NEUT23|If you want to buy those stocks, forget it.
BEAR24|They'll move him up too much.
NEUT25|The biggest risk, though.
BEAR26|I think it's the lack of diversification.
NEUT27|These spected of ghost stories tend to trade as a group.
BEAR28|Right now the market loss momentum, so they're doing great, but the next time momentum goes out of style, well that could be lookout below.
NEUT29|Here's the bottom line, Kathy would.
NEUT30|And her team at our kit invest had made some incredible calls in my hat is off to my hat is tipped to them.
BULL31|They're absolutely deserve all the praise they're getting.
NEUT32|We're going to continue to follow her like a Hawk.
NEUT33|That said, when I see so many copycats trying to imitate the same manager and take stock ahead of her, it makes me a little nervous.
NEUT34|So keep your eyes open, wait for when we think enough is enough.
NEUT35|But remember it sure is it.
