NEUT0|"""However, one last look at the Apple stock we can see here today."
NEUT1|It has formed a red candle here with long upper shadow and Lower Shadow.
NEUT2|That means buying and selling is equal.
BEAR3|But anyway we have made a new low compared to the day before it, because here there's no new law.
NEUT4|Here is the law.
BEAR5|But today the law is lower than a lot made two days ago, so bearish.
NEUT6|And also we can see the death cross for the Army line and Frying pan top.
BULL7|So it means Apple will continue job.
BEAR8|There's no sign of recovery.
BULL9|"Thank you."""
