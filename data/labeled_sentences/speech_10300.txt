NEUT0|"""Everyone, let's take like the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see.
BEAR2|Apple has formed a huge red candle the 12345 fifth day of job and we can see this dodgy pattern has confirmed the topping so we have back down to the formal trading area especially we are down below this line.
BULL3|The formal higher here.
BEAR4|So actually this has been the Apple stock has been weak so I don't have any full size for this stock so it's a cell.
BULL5|"Thank you."""
