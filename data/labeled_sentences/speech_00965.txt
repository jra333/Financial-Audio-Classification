NEUT0|"""Fashion in the United States until what 2023, right?"
NEUT1|So I'm wondering about 2023.
NEUT2|You're very specific.
NEUT3|I have to say I noted that that that's incredibly specific.
NEUT4|Dates.
NEUT5|I've only got it down in my long term diary.
NEUT6|Where do you think I were 225 now?
NEUT7|Where will rates be at that point?
NEUT8|The so I have I think guy have a chance of studying economic factors and coming up with the most likely date for recession, which let's just say is years out.
NEUT9|And that's also because I meet with investors constantly.
NEUT10|This is not a topic that I get a lot of pushback on.
NEUT11|People are now beginning to think that it's a ways out and the some of the factors that argue for that as an example, would be that once the growth in earnings peak.
NEUT12|SMP earnings, which they peak around 25 or 30%.
BEAR13|The recession is two or three years out after that, and once average average hourly earnings start to go up, they hit 4% and then you get a recession.
NEUT14|And right now there are 3%.
BULL15|So I think the economy today is quite good.
NEUT16|Let's say consumer sentiment that came out a few minutes ago would_that just walked over to your lovely office this morning and I felt like I needed a hardhat.
NEUT17|'cause there's so much construction going on around here.
NEUT18|And that's true for almost every city I visit.
BEAR19|So the economy is doing well and I think it will slow next year to something like 2 1/4.
BEAR20|An recession then.
NEUT21|I'll just keep keep going and I'll monitor that every day.
NEUT22|But do you think that the Fed keeps tightening?
NEUT23|So wow, this guy is a really long term bull.
NEUT24|He doesn't think a recession will happen until 2023.
BEAR25|And as a crypto investor, I think that would be not good for crypto assets.
BULL26|Obviously I have been preaching on this channel that I do believe cryptocurrencies will hit a billion dollar market cap.
NEUT27|And I was predicting by the end of 2018, which doesn't look like it's going to happen.
NEUT28|But if there is no recession and the economy, the US economy in the real estate markets stay on path to 2023.
NEUT29|I do see crypto being flat and dead, but I just find it very unlikely.
NEUT30|The Fed and like I said, it's very.
BEAR31|It's up to the Fed if the Fed keeps raising interest rates, the economy has to come to this halt because companies are super leveraged in debt and so is the consumer, and they're not going to be able to afford the debt if the rates keep going up.
NEUT32|"But let me know what you guys think about this and I will talk to you guys soon."""
