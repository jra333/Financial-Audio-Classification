NEUT1|Back on the video today today I'll be talking about Tesla.
NEUT2|Take assemble TSLA.
NEUT3|And I'll give you guys.
NEUT4|My Tesla stock analysis and also my test stock predictions.
NEUT5|And also some key levels that I see going forward.

NEUT8|So this is a support area that I've found when it was stock was running up that I was looking for it to come back down to.
NEUT9|It didn't quite get it right here, so trading sideways came up again.
BULL10|Made new highs.
NEUT11|And then aggressively drop down and back up.
NEUT12|Drop down again.
NEUT13|This support level I had was 774 and look at this low right here.
NEUT14|It will show up here.
NEUT15|This load came in at.
BEAR16|780.1 An I had seven 7.4 so $6 off.
BEAR17|So this is still a support because it didn't hit it.
NEUT18|So this is still a key support, just in case if the site does come down you can have this level 'cause I think it will still be a strong support that didn't quite hit it right there, but they get close and look at the movement afterwards as it got close to the level that I gave you guys.
NEUT19|And you're straight up.
NEUT20|So now.
NEUT21|If the stock does come down tomorrow.
NEUT22|Watch out for this level right here and at 842.47.
NEUT23|This would be the support air that I might see price bounce off of if it comes down tomorrow, but if it just starts going up.
BEAR24|And if it goes above like 896, then I think we can well see price go over $900 but it just does start coming down tomorrow.
BEAR25|I think it might bounce off the support area and then go to higher highs or if it falls below this data can come down here to 812 to 69.
NEUT26|812.69 This is the last defense, and if it breaks this, then I'll be looking for here.
NEUT27|So the 30 levels I'm looking for.
NEUT28|Tomorrow if it comes down I'm looking for here for the reaction to go higher.
NEUT29|If it breaks that I'm looking for the action here to go higher.
NEUT30|If it breaks that I'm looking for action here to go higher.
NEUT31|And if tomorrow it opens higher, if it has a 96, then I think we could see price over 900, so that's why I'm playing Tesla.
