NEUT0|"""What's up, guys Russell here today?"
NEUT1|I'd like to talk about Warren Buffett and what he has been doing during the first month and a half of 2021.
NEUT2|So since the beginning of the month in January 1st of January 2, February 16 in 2021, Warren Buffett has bought back roughly 4 to $5 billion in Berkshire Stock and Berkshire stock.
NEUT3|During that time was from maybe 220 to $252 a share for the virtual B shares.
NEUT4|And you know the annual report that they filed recently suggests that they probably bought back 3300 of the A shares an 13.7 million of the B shares.
NEUT5|So probably you know, depending on what prices they were buying, it was probably maybe from 4 to $5 billion in terms of purchases.
NEUT6|And if you look at the volume throughout maybe a month and a half, they were probably buying, and they were probably 10% of the market.
NEUT7|Buying those stocks so you know.
NEUT8|I think Berkshire is trying to at least invest the money.
NEUT9|Maybe in buying back Berkshire all the money that they generate from operating earnings.
NEUT10|And so if you look at, you know maybe 2020 they maybe they made you know 20 or $25 billion and they bought back $25 billion in Berkshire stock.
NEUT11|And so I think at least what they want to do is not grow their cash file and so.
NEUT12|You know, if you generate $25 billion in 2021, you gotta buy back at least $25 billion in Berkshire stock, you know to to eliminate that cash because the cash that Berkshire has.
NEUT13|Which is at this point, maybe you know North of $100 billion.
NEUT14|You gotta do something with that money.
BEAR15|And so if you're adding to that money, it's you know the problem is getting worse and worse.
NEUT16|And on the other hand, if you look at the marketable securities, which are probably mostly, you know the float in the insurance companies, those marketable securities are already $250 billion.
NEUT17|An you know, in eight or ten years that $250 billion will become a $500 billion problem.
NEUT18|And so you have to.
NEUT19|I think Warren is realizing that you have to plow back the money somewhere.
NEUT20|You can't wait forever to find those crazy big deals.
NEUT21|And so you know that I think you know Warren is trying to fix the problem of the cash that they have.
BULL22|Or at least to have the problem maybe not get bigger overtime, and so I think it's a very good thing that Berkshire is buying back its own stock.
BEAR23|You know, Berkshire stock is undervalued?
NEUT24|According to my calculations, and according to Whitney Tilson and many other people, I think you know maybe it's not under valued as much as I would like to be.
NEUT25|But it's undervalued nonetheless, and clearly, you know Warren Buffett by buying back its own stock.
NEUT26|You know things that Berkshire Hathaway is undervalued and it would be positive for their current shareholders who are still holding on is if he buys back Berkshire stock.
NEUT27|So that's it for now.
NEUT28|If you own rusher stock, please share in the comments below.
BULL29|"I'd love to hear from you."""
