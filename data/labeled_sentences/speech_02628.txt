NEUT0|"""Mickey let me cut to the chase with great respect for the heritage of the Shadow FOMC cabinet."
NEUT1|And of course the heritage of the late Marvin Goodfriend.
NEUT2|Should we fear inflation with this debt buildup?
NEUT3|Not right now.
NEUT4|My clear answer is yes, the Fed is pumping in huge amounts of of what we call high powered money reserves plus currency.
NEUT5|But until that money is put to work in the economy until you see an acceleration, the answer is no.
BEAR6|So actually Tom in the near term because you actually have nominal GDP, is current dollar spending declining?
NEUT7|You're going to have about a deflation in the future.
NEUT8|Right Mickey, if the solution is a massive multi trillion dollar income supplement during what is a fixed pandemic crisis is the solution down the road to monetize all that debt buildup out into long term bonds and basically pay off the pandemic over say 50 years.
NEUT9|No, that's not the product.
NEUT10|The proper approach.
NEUT11|Clearly this fiscal package.
NEUT12|I don't think of it as stimulus.
NEUT13|I think it is income support when when the bottles falling out of aggregate demand it has to be unwound.
NEUT14|Now the critical question is do we pay for this?
NEUT15|And the answer is absolutely, you're going to pay either in the form of higher taxes, lower government services, and even if it doesn't show up as higher.
NEUT16|Inflation or higher interest rate.
NEUT17|We pay for this one way or the other, but the answer is not to just, you know, monetize it, monetize it.
NEUT18|Once again, it's not going to show up and inflation until until we get all that high powered money put to work in the economy.
NEUT19|And when we do start to see an acceleration, that's when we have to be careful.
NEUT20|But right now the whole focus is on income support in getting us through this acute stage of the pandemic.
NEUT21|But I think he would everyone pay for it.
NEUT22|There wouldn't be some kind of worldwide, you know, debt relief like we saw in times of war, because what we're dealing with is is quite war.
NEUT23|Like, right?
NEUT24|A lot of heads of state have have been talking about this kind of invisible war.
NEUT25|We're fighting.
BEAR26|I see when I say we're gonna pay for it when I what I mean by that is, you know you can't just have a huge decline in global economic output by port through increase.
NEUT27|You know, through deficit spending in various nations in higher debt and not have it be costly.
NEUT28|So one way or another, you pay for it, either in terms of lower potential growth, going forward, higher taxes, lower government government services.
NEUT29|But one point you made is interesting.
BEAR30|In a sense, this is like a war, but it's really a negative supply and demand shock.
NEUT31|A real war like World War One, World War Two, you actually destroyed capital, so there was tremendous capital building after that that actually added the economic growth afterwards following historic pandemics.
NEUT32|You don't have that capital spend build and it takes awhile for the economy to come back for consumers to get their legs under him and feel confident enough to spend.
NEUT33|I wouldn't be surprised over the next year even after we come out of this state.
NEUT34|"If consumers are cautious, save a little for spend a little less."""
