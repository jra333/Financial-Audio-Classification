BULL0|"""Hi guys Chris here at opt in trading back again with another video today."
NEUT1|We're talking about ozone ticker owes Edwin on the NASDAQ and I'm going to run through a couple of points here.
NEUT2|Why I think this is a good opportunity to buy.
BULL3|As if the Amazon Russia can it compete with the current competitors and their industry?
NEUT4|And where do I see it going in the future?
NEUT5|So firstly, let's talk about the valuation.
BEAR6|$45 per share and implies a 8 billion market cap.
NEUT7|It works in our growing market.
BULL8|This Russian market grew 51% in the first six months of 2020 compared to the previous year, and is expected to grow 6 to 15% over the next five years.
NEUT9|E-commerce makes up only 11% of total retail sales in Russia versus 16% of the global average.
BULL10|So there is 50% upside just from increased user adoption.
BULL11|So as a company that grew 87% in 2018 to 2019, resulting in $832 million in sales is recently raised nearly a billion dollars.
NEUT12|And on the NASDAQ, as IP owed a couple months ago and now has over 1 billion cash and the balance sheet to fill its growth strategy.
NEUT13|So why are the resident opportunities of their stock?
BEAR14|Or firstly, the ripple exchange rate has become the weakest's ever been over the past couple of years?
BEAR15|Severely devalued against the US dollar due to.
NEUT16|Oil price changes.
BULL17|But I think there's an opportunity there for that to be re rated.
BULL18|Also, the current market e-commerce market in Russia is under penetrated and there are a lot of opportunities for growth here.
BULL19|But ozone is cheap relative to global peers such as C limited that are based in Asia.
NEUT20|Mechanic Lee Brayton, safe America and Jumia in Africa.
NEUT21|Right now these companies are valued between 23 and 27.
NEUT22|Raven you.
NEUT23|So my employee valuation based on this would be for took the 23.
NEUT24|Revenue.
BULL25|An implied growth of sales.
BULL26|This year's 70% so they will take in 1.4 billion in revenues.
NEUT27|Vamp Lisa 32 billion market cap, which has a four times opportunity for a stock.
NEUT28|I expect the stock in the future to be.
NEUT29|Over $200 right now is setting at around 45.
BULL30|And so I think this is a great opportunity to get in.
NEUT31|"This is just a quick video if you guys want a more in depth with you, just let me know what you guys think in the comments and I'll see you next time, thanks."""
