NEUT0|"""Amazon and Future Group finally made it official, the world's largest etailer has taken the option to actually bought into 49% stake in future coupons."
NEUT1|A promoter company of future retail.
NEUT2|But what's more interesting is the closet is put in, which allows Amazon to buy out the entire stake of Kishore Biyani in future retail.
NEUT3|After three years Agombar kill his ear to explain this entire structure towards Adam.
BULL4|Alright, baby, now, well, as you already mentioned, the long awaited deal is finally here between future retail and Amazon, and we have been hearing a lot.
NEUT5|About this over the last few quarters and now, will this come to fruition?
NEUT6|So to start off with the deal itself, as you've already mentioned, about 49% stake that Amazon will buy in future coupons, which is a promoter entity for future retail.
NEUT7|An future coupons does not own ordinary shares, it holds warrants which were issued to the company back in February.
NEUT8|But that said, while the future retail is buying about half percent nearly nearly half of this particular stake.
NEUT9|There will be more in future when it comes to this particular deal, so as a second part, as the first part, of course the deal is that Amazon gets voting and non voting shares, but in the second part there is also a call option available to Amazon whereby it allows Amazon to buy the remaining stake in future or coupons between the 3rd and the 10th year.
NEUT10|Of course a lot of this will be subject to subject to, well, you know, mutual exceptions as well as several applicable laws.
NEUT11|But on the whole, this is how the deal looks like and what is really interesting is that the deal also values future retail at a significant premium.
NEUT12|That's what we wanted to ask you.
NEUT13|Again.
NEUT14|How are the valuation stacked up?
NEUT15|Well, actually this valuation is quite significant.
NEUT16|If I tell you 87% through the current market valuation, well, that does certainly seem like a very very big deal.
NEUT17|But according to the numbers that we're playing with, you know back in February, the.
NEUT18|The The deal that future coupons and future retail had is that future retail would issue future coupons.
NEUT19|Warrants were 2000 cross and it immediately got 500 cross of warrants which were when the payment was made.
NEUT20|Immediately the balance 1500 cross is what Amazon is going to now bring in and pay for the warrants for this particular state.
NEUT21|The 49% stake in future coupons and that is that stands at around 3.68%.
NEUT22|All future retails.
NEUT23|Well, entire equity.
NEUT24|Now if you equate the 1500 crores, do that 3.68% equity and you extrapolate the market cap that comes to somewhere around 40,000 cross.
NEUT25|But let's not forget the advance, the war.
NEUT26|Once these warnings get converted into shares, there will be in a little bit of an equity expansion as well, and that's where our core based on those calculations, the market cap goes to more than 41,000 crows do remember that the current market capitalization.
NEUT27|"For a well or future, retail stands at a less than 21,000 cross, and that's the reason why this particular deal is quite staggering when it comes to valuations given to future retail based on just particular this particular deal."""
