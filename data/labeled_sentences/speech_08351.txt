BEAR0|"""A lot of people have been struggling financially during this pandemic, but apparently not the richest people."
BULL1|A new study shows that the top billionaires got 54% richer during the pandemic.
NEUT2|54% think about that in one year.
NEUT3|Yes, it's insane.
NEUT4|That's a lot of money and about 2300 billionaires in the world are.
NEUT5|That's the number we're talking about it about.
NEUT6|Pretty small when you think about it, but the financial impact of the pandemic when our habits changed, so did their wallets Amazon's.
NEUT7|Jeff Basous wrecked in 178 billion.
BULL8|I mean, and that's up from 113.
NEUT9|So when our survey?
NEUT10|Yeah billion up from 113 billion number two behind that in the world is the family behind Louis Vuitton.
BULL11|They were up 114% so they more than doubled what they were at Elon Musk.
NEUT12|I mean obviously Tesla going through the roof, he's up 55160% Bill Gates, up about 30%, but was interesting when you look on this list of the top ten billionaires in the country.
BULL13|Everybody's net worth is up by over 50% except for Gates.
BULL14|He's up by 30%.
NEUT15|That's a lot.
BULL16|That is a ton, and we know when the habits change for people, they begin shopping more online shopping from home, and those sales online increased.
NEUT17|But for some folks, life began to look a lot different.
BULL18|The poverty rates increased.
BEAR19|Two people were unable to work, particularly folks in the service sector.
BEAR20|Those with jobs that maybe don't pay as well.
NEUT21|They really took a hit last year.
NEUT22|Right, because you look OK, you have the one side.
NEUT23|You have the billionaires.
NEUT24|When you have the stock market just going gangbusters throughout this entire time it's a lot of people trying to figure out how can we live in a society like this where you have that happening at the one end and then you have the other and the poverty rates going up there too?
BEAR25|Because if you look at the jobs that disappeared, 80% of them were to low income workers there too.
NEUT26|Yeah, they keep talking about this kind of case shaped recovery that people who are doing well or doing great but people who are not doing well.
BEAR27|Are really not doing well and that really affects jobs like in the service sector.
NEUT28|When you think about restaurants and businesses that rely on that foot traffic coming in the door when it's not the same, some of the folks that take that hit their people of color.
NEUT29|People who are just trying to make ends meet in some cases and they're just not getting the same dollars.
NEUT30|And you wonder, Sheila if this makes people.
NEUT31|Think differently about billionaires, because I think in the past you know decades ago we thought, well, you know you work hard and you get what you deserve, but it seems like from the polling that's going on that this is this idea of just this huge income gap in income disparities, and they're widening and widening by every single day that people are thinking.
NEUT32|It's not fair.
BEAR33|New poll out shows that 72% of people say, look this isn't fair.
NEUT34|20% of people think that it is, but 72% Dotan you wonder if that makes people.
NEUT35|More open to the idea, perhaps of a wealth tax on those that Mega wealthy grew, and some people are talking about that.
NEUT36|Elizabeth Warren would like to have a wealth tax extra 2% for those who make over 50 million extra 3% on billionaires and so have to see if that gains any traction.
NEUT37|"Sometimes it can be tough to do that and get support in Washington for it, but we'll have to see how that works out absolutely."""
