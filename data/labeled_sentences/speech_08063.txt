BULL0|"""There are a lot of reasons we see that the price of gold has appreciated recently."
BULL1|Gold is seen as a safe haven asset to hold in times of uncertainty.
NEUT2|With global tensions rising, a lot of people have started buying gold.
BULL3|The increased demand has led to an increase in the price of gold.
NEUT4|But what if I was to tell you that gold still hasn't hit its peak?
NEUT5|If you adjusted for inflation, take a look at this graph here.
BEAR6|When you adjust for inflation, you can see that gold had peaked in the 1980s, right around the time when inflation was spiking higher.
NEUT7|In the United States.
BEAR8|Today's inflation adjusted gold prices are lower than the 2011 peak.
NEUT9|But now you may be wondering, how does that relate to Warren Buffett buying Barrick Gold?
NEUT10|Buying a gold miner is a leveraged way to buy gold.
NEUT11|What I mean by this is that if you've got a good gold miner with mines in safe jurisdictions and low levels of debt, the fixed cost of extracting the gold translate into much, much, much higher earnings for the gold miner as the price of gold goes up.
NEUT12|Here we are on the global Operations page for Barrick Gold.
NEUT13|In 2020, the company expects to extract 4.6 to 5,000,000 ounces of gold this year.
NEUT14|The average cost of production has to be.
BEAR15|Lower than $1000 to be profitable.
BULL16|At current gold prices, the company has substantial free cash flows and is able to pay down its debt and reward the shareholders.
NEUT17|My personal opinion about Buffett's purchase of $500 million worth of Barrick Gold stock approximately is that we're just seeing the tip of the iceberg.
NEUT18|It is very likely that we will see further purchase of Barrick Gold by Warren Buffett.
NEUT19|I wouldn't be surprised if he also adds another gold miner to his portfolio at Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT20|A company that I see would be a suitable target for Warren Buffett to start is Newmont Corp. Newmont Corp has minds that are in safe jurisdictions.
NEUT21|It has debt, but it is manageable.
BULL22|Debt and their free cash flows would grow substantially with the increase in the price of gold.
NEUT23|This is definitely a stock that Buffett may be looking at.
NEUT24|What do you think is going to be?
NEUT25|The price of gold in the future?
NEUT26|Do you think it's going to go higher or do you think it's going to go lower?
NEUT27|Do let me know your thought in the comments below.
