NEUT0|"""Slide on your show."
NEUT1|We talked a lot about it yesterday that incredible lineup, but specific to the earnings and again, back to this conversation about growth companies.
BEAR2|Perhaps no longer participating in this market in the way they had been.
NEUT3|Salesforce.
NEUT4|Very strong, number, right, but nobody cares what stock was down immediately.
NEUT5|12 bucks.
NEUT6|OK, you mentioned NVIDIA, although I am seeing it looking up now.
NEUT7|This.
NEUT8|I mean we we managed to explain it isn't a crypto play.
NEUT9|Darn it right?
NEUT10|That's what people were saying.
NEUT11|Oh 2018 they did crypto and they got crushed that could happen again.
NEUT12|That's just untrue.
NEUT13|Air B&B.
NEUT14|Just beyond, I think the Chesky told a story of I know through the evening show it you have to be careful because you use terms that are the terminology, but David, the leverage of that model is extraordinary.
NEUT15|For Airbnb I mean they basically every single new home, every single new host is just additive.
NEUT16|It's incredible and that's why there's his EBIT.
BULL17|DA was so so amazing.
NEUT18|This may be of all the companies that are of that, that mint mint, that one period, including DoorDash.
NEUT19|This company has a business model.
NEUT20|That is just extraordinary.
NEUT21|The more the more gas, more money, the more hosts, more money and their recruiting host.
NEUT22|That is the winner of last night of these newly minted companies, not DoorDash at all.
NEUT23|Well, we yeah we listen to Tony on on Squawk Box.
BEAR24|Carl DoorDash shares are looking down but you can see Air BNB quite strong and will keep a close eye on Invidia, an sales for us in any number of the others including of course HP Q also which reported strangely earlier than anticipated.
NEUT25|Yeah yesterday.
NEUT26|It was expected to be 4:00 o'clock Eastern, but I think they was 2:30 or something.
NEUT27|Yeah, it was very strange.
BEAR28|I thought that there was some sort of weird break in.
NEUT29|Yes, like some sort of an emergency release.
NEUT30|It was an emergency release.
NEUT31|You have to get these numbers out to the market.
NEUT32|Right now.
NEUT33|We can't wait another hour and a half.
BULL34|They were super Karl again.
NEUT35|I mean in Del Two and Michael Dell David.
NEUT36|Yeah unbelievable but quarrel.
NEUT37|This whole thing about having the office at home.
NEUT38|The biggest winners are HP and Dell because you need to have a duplicate office at home.
NEUT39|By the way, finally Printers Inc amazing why because your home is your Castle slash workplace and that's something.
BEAR40|Once again, Marc Benioff has the largest tower in San Francisco and it is empty.
BEAR41|Carl, it's empty.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
