NEUT0|"""Back to Janet Yellen."
NEUT1|Steve Forbes is with us this morning Steve.
NEUT2|A bigger impact on the markets?
NEUT3|Janet Yellen.
NEUT4|What she has to say today?
NEUT5|Or the British vote on Thursday.
NEUT6|They go together, they do the markets feel that Britain will stay in.
BEAR7|If it doesn't, that's going to be a shock.
NEUT8|And the thing with Janet Yellen is everyone assumes that keeping interest rates low helps the economy, like rent control helps the housing market.
NEUT9|It doesn't.
NEUT10|She should liberate the markets, but she won't.
NEUT11|So the Fed is going to be anti economic growth.
NEUT12|So that's where we are at this moment on the markets.
BEAR13|The investors feel that the Brits will stay in and investors fear that Janet Yellen will not raise rates.
NEUT14|Therefore something of a sailmaker go nowhere market.
NEUT15|Is that it?
BEAR16|Markets really been going nowhere for a year and a half profits have gone nowhere for a year and a half, so we have all these ups and downs.
NEUT17|Great for daily, a commentary, but we're going nowhere fast.
BEAR18|We headed for recession.
NEUT19|Yeah question.
BEAR20|No, just simply stagnation.
NEUT21|Second gear like the Yankees on hitting his twenty before we go forward.
BULL22|I know you're going to stay with us.
NEUT23|I want to ask you, are you in favor?
NEUT24|The Brits leaving the European Union?
NEUT25|No, I think Britain has a role to save Europe from itself, just as it did in a very dramatic fashion.
NEUT26|"World War Two times up Forbes."""
