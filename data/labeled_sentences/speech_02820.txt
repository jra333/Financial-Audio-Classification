NEUT0|"""I don't know if you cut this a. Ethereum kind of ether hit a record today."
NEUT1|Yeah, I was watching the you were watching it.
BULL2|Yeah it's doing pretty good.
NEUT3|It's just rising.
NEUT4|Why is this?
NEUT5|Are you invested in this stuff?
NEUT6|No, it's just usually.
BEAR7|I see it correlate with Bitcoin OK, but for some reason Ethereum is kind of off and its own branch recently is flying.
NEUT8|Yeah yeah, let's see what is that right now.
NEUT9|We might as well do a time of filming.
NEUT10|Oh yeah.
BULL11|Yeah, we're definitely in an all time high territory.
BULL12|Yeah, we're all time high.
NEUT13|On that baby so so you can kind of see some dips in Bitcoin.
NEUT14|Usually it's like almost one to one, but theory I'm just flying right now.
BULL15|Yeah, it's up 6.19% last 24 hours.
BULL16|So that's good.
NEUT17|Yeah, people have a stock in it.
NEUT18|Well I think the question I've been watching it since this morning and I was curious as I was curious as well.
NEUT19|Obviously we've had the NFT stuff and then we had the visa announcement that there that they were going to be relying on Therium blockchain.
NEUT20|I suppose the question becomes.
NEUT21|What else is at play as far as this six and a half percent gain on one single day?
NEUT22|I heard a Cuban made announcement saying that he owns a lot of ether.
NEUT23|Me.
NEUT24|I think that that was like today.
NEUT25|You feel like that bounced that or that pumped it up a little bit.
NEUT26|I think so.
NEUT27|Yeah, here we have a couple reasons.
NEUT28|Ethereum is about to skyrocket.
NEUT29|Superstar artist Damien Hirst to sell 10,000 NFTS using a new Ethereum technology called Palm.
NEUT30|I mean, people are just getting involved, man.
NEUT31|People, there's hype.
BULL32|There is certainly hype.
NEUT33|This is the.
NEUT34|This is the thing you were talking about.
NEUT35|Yeah, Mark Cuban on his own cryptocurrency portfolio.
NEUT36|I own a lot of Ethereum because I think it's the closest to a true currency.
NEUT37|This was yesterday.
NEUT38|Now yesterday was April Fools so.
BULL39|The old April Fools, but I think this could have helped.
NEUT40|Yeah.
NEUT41|Let's see what The Motley Fool says.
NEUT42|Here are three reasons Ethereum is about to skyrocket.
NEUT43|Visa adoption where we talked about that one yesterday payments Juggernaut Visa announced it would start settling transactions in cryptocurrency.
NEUT44|The companies partnered with crypto.com.
NEUT45|To pilot a settlement layer based on the Ethereum network?
BULL46|OK, that's good NFTS.
NEUT47|We already talked about it, that's all Ethereum base and then supply cut, which we've talked about a little bit here.
NEUT48|That's the idea that.
NEUT49|Some Ethereum would be burned, burned and gone out of circulation, so unlike.
NEUT50|A supply chain where you just have a limited amount?
NEUT51|Yeah, what if every transaction you're actually effectively getting rid of some that's even hotter?
NEUT52|Yeah, and that's supposed to happen with EP.
NEUT53|1559.
NEUT54|That's the controversial thing that minors are.
NEUT55|Don't know how to feel about.
BEAR56|Anyway, regardless, the network is poised for higher demand and lower supply.
NEUT57|You know how these things go?
NEUT58|You start burning his stuff up.
NEUT59|Shout out ethereum.
NEUT60|That's that's actually my crypto of choice as well.
NEUT61|I mean, I might as well put it on there.
NEUT62|Yeah, so.
NEUT63|I'm in there.
NEUT64|You're playing the game.
NEUT65|"I'm in there a little bit."""
