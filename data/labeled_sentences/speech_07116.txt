NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol TLR."
NEUT1|Why we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame?
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, the downwards drift continues so yeah, the charts already bearish.
BEAR5|But now the the chart is sitting right on the edge of potentially making things that much more bearish.
NEUT6|And that quote unquote edge if you will, is actually just a support level which sits right down here at $20.90.
NEUT7|So you if you go back and let me actually do this just to offer up that much more context.
NEUT8|So as you can see here, 2090 has been tested several times.
BULL9|You go back here, tested a couple of times, held strong right there, held strong and then to give credit credit suit once again today.
NEUT10|Was tested and held strong, but the reason why it's such an important level and why it would make things just that much more bearish is of if the price drops down below there.
NEUT11|The last time the price been down around that area is way back there.
NEUT12|I mean, we're talking several weeks ago down around that area, which would just equate and put that much more bearish is.
NEUT13|I mean like I said right here.
BEAR14|Already a bearish channel, you know that's not rocket science to say that, but I'm in for it to then break down below that level, which is historically been an area of support.
NEUT15|Yeah, that would not be a good situation at all from the bull standpoint, but like I said to give credit where credit is due.
BULL16|So far so good, the price is holding above that green line at 2090, so let's see if I can continue to be the case moving forward as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT17|If there is any sort of attempted bounce off this level first, the level to watch.
NEUT18|From the resistance side of things is going to be right there at $21.50 and then the next level after that would be that purple line up there.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Moving average currently valued right around $22.15, so those would be the main dynamics to watch moving forward.
NEUT21|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT22|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT23|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT24|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL25|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT26|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT27|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR28|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT29|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT30|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT31|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT32|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT33|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT34|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note.
NEUT35|It is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT36|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT37|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
