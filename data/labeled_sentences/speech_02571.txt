BEAR0|"""U.S. stocks tumble on the weak jobs report there where you're looking at a live shot of the action happening down at the New York Stock Exchange on the big Board."
BEAR1|The Dow Jones industrials down 204 points after the government reports showing US job growth slowing down in the last month significantly.
BULL2|And of course, the unemployment rate also to be climbing higher at 8.2%.
NEUT3|Good afternoon everyone.
NEUT4|I'm Kelsey Hubbard.
BEAR5|Welcome to lunch break so I'd have to bring in you in on such unfortunate news.
NEUT6|But of course, we've got Paul Vigna here to sort of sort it all out for us.
NEUT7|The market.
NEUT8|Alright, anchor that brings it all to us everyday and Paul.
BEAR9|This obviously was not a welcome news.
BEAR10|Very bad report is much worse than really almost anybody expected and it was a very bad sign for the economy at a time when the US economy is a very, very fragile state.
BEAR11|What's really best we had bad signs from overseas overnight?
NEUT12|These manufacturing reports out of China out of Europe.
BEAR13|They were all bad Europe obviously with the sovereign debt crisis everything was looking bad.
BEAR14|This jobs were not really expected with great report anyhow.
BEAR15|But is much worse than people thought.
NEUT16|And now you have people, just the entire recalculation of what's going on in the United States and you can see it reflected in the stock market.
NEUT17|Yeah, we also are looking at the Treasury yields.
BEAR18|Had a big drop.
BULL19|It was so big jumping gold.
BEAR20|So obviously people are panicking a little bit in the US, the 10 year yield for US Treasurys below 1.50 record territory.
BEAR21|I mean, unbelievably low people are pouring into Treasurys.
NEUT22|What you're seeing is a real concern among investors among traders.
NEUT23|They just want their money.
NEUT24|You know, you figure it.
NEUT25|Treasurys or safe haven be 'cause it's a bond.
NEUT26|US isn't going to.
NEUT27|You want to fault on it?
NEUT28|You know you may not get any interest on it.
BEAR29|You may be losing ground and inflation related here, but your money is safe.
NEUT30|You are seeing a real flight to quality real flight to safe havens.
NEUT31|People are just concerned with keeping their money.
NEUT32|They don't care right now, at least about return on investment.
NEUT33|They want to return of their investment and we should mention too.
BEAR34|We've seen the worst drop from the Dow this year and wiping out the gains that we've had.
NEUT35|Depending on where we end today, the Dow is right around where it started the year.
NEUT36|The SNP is a little bit above it, with the SNP.
NEUT37|Important number is 1284.
NEUT38|That's roughly the 200 day moving average big technical marker.
BEAR39|If the SNP kind of takes that out, we could see the losses go much further down if they hold that you might see a little bit of a rally into the close that a little.
NEUT40|I'm not going to great one, but you might.
NEUT41|That's where the big battle is being fought right now.
NEUT42|But yeah, the Dow is right at those 2000 right where it started the year.
NEUT43|So look, everything happen in the first quarter.
NEUT44|It's all been wiped away the last month.
NEUT45|Plus and of course still the troubles in Europe remained, so that's also a, you know, that's that's going out that even the real thing is that went nowhere on here and it's going nowhere.
NEUT46|It's not going away.
NEUT47|That's the issue there.
NEUT48|"It's not going away."""
