NEUT0|"""You know those Speaking of changes in behavior Carl and direct to consumer we do."
NEUT1|Gotta get to Nike don't we?
NEUT2|Who 'cause those numbers were so strong?
BULL3|Of course we mentioned it or at the top of the show, market share gains across all geographies and they did really benefit as well from direct to consumer Carl.
BULL4|The numbers were nothing short of extraordinary as we see a stock that's going to be up 11 1/2 percent.
NEUT5|What a conference.
NEUT6|Call with that employer.
BULL7|The agent between that and J&J it's going to help the indicies.
NEUT8|I see even those who are doubting going in.
NEUT9|I think Deutsche Bank is going today from 1:07 to 151, so we're seeing a lot of people get religion on it today.
NEUT10|Yeah, well it's funny.
NEUT11|I don't think you could ever have predicted that.
NEUT12|I would argue that they should have pre announced.
BULL13|Frankly, the acceleration digital 83% acceleration in digital.
NEUT14|I mean that's extraordinary about North American people thought they were going to 3.4 billion.
NEUT15|They did 4.2 billion.
BULL16|Women gaining share.
NEUT17|Some of this stuff was just was not hyperbole.
NEUT18|No one can match our pace.
NEUT19|I like that one very much.
NEUT20|It was.
NEUT21|It was a Tour de force quarter, an one of the things that I found about Nike.
NEUT22|It does not need a vaccine.
NEUT23|I mean, that's how I put.
NEUT24|I'm going to talk about that tonight on May have money, David.
NEUT25|There are companies that need a vaccine and the ones that don't need a vaccine.
BULL26|Of course they had 6% growth in China.
BEAR27|They were down a couple of percent in United States, but they don't need a vaccine because they have direct to consumer.
BULL28|And it's really good.
BULL29|Macy's picked up 4,000,000 new customers because of the vaccine.
NEUT30|No vaccine I Jeff Bennett on last night will talk about that later, but you need to find out company what companies need a vaccine and what companies don't.
NEUT31|And that's going to be the divide.
NEUT32|That's the Grand Canyon David.
NEUT33|And it has been the divide in the market as well.
NEUT34|Course we talk about it all the time and then we also talked about the greater divide, which is sort of the real economy versus what we see reflected on our screens.
NEUT35|I mean like the Tesla economy.
NEUT36|Yeah, we'll talk tests on it.
BEAR37|There's a fresh bearish pick that positive this morning.
NEUT38|I mean, it doesn't matter, it's it's must be 20 million because 20 million batteries gonna be able to do in 20.
NEUT39|Well so far battery Day, but Jim look back to Nike.
BULL40|Everything seems to be working well for them.
NEUT41|As you say, direct prosumer is so robust and the fact that people are staying home and not putting on suits anymore and they're wearing casual wear.
BULL42|That's also helpful.
BEAR43|"That trend I thought that hurt Stitch Fix frankly, but we have to argue that back and forth."""
