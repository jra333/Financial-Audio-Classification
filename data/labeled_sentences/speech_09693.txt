NEUT0|"""Hey guys today will be going over some technical analysis."
NEUT1|Technical analysis is a technique used by many investors to try and forecast the direction of prices by identifying patterns based on past market data such as price and volume.
NEUT2|I often use this in conjunction with my fundamental analysis.
NEUT3|After I've determined I like the stock based on his fundamentals, then I'll take a look at the technical analysis to see what is a good price point to either buy or sell.
NEUT4|Depending if I want to enter exit a trade today.
NEUT5|Let's take a look at Facebook since this recent moves have made it very interesting.
NEUT6|I've already looked at the company's fundamentals.
BULL7|Determined that I really liked it, especially now that it's begun to break out of his trading range and has addressed the Apple privacy change issue.
NEUT8|So the first thing I'd like to do is take a look at the overall monthly charts to see how the stock is doing and what direction is headed.
NEUT9|Technical analysis is based on momentum and thus we always want to follow the upward trend of the stock if we want to go along.
BEAR10|So here on a monthly chart, we see that since August has been very stagnant, with trading mostly rangebound peaking at around $300 in August, and since then it's been going back and forth between the 250 and a $290.00 range.
BULL11|Now recently it has pushed backed up above the $209 level.
BULL12|If it stays above this $290.00 then I think we will go higher.
BULL13|It has a very nice upward trajectory and has seen a strong buy in the past week.
NEUT14|The next level of resistance is at this green line around the $330 level.
NEUT15|Next, let's dig deeper and take a look at the weekly data here.
BULL16|The price action also looks very good as it just broke out of its resistance as shown by this red line.
BULL17|As you can see, this has been a very strong resistance since August.
BULL18|I think we may see a short term pullback to the red line, which was resistance, but now will be the new support line.
BEAR19|Thus we may see a retest at the $280 level.
BULL20|If it holds, then I think it would be a good buy.
NEUT21|But if it doesn't hold, then it would look to retest at this blue support line at around 245.
BULL22|Overall, the weekly chart looks really good on good volume.
NEUT23|Next, let's go even deeper and look further into the daily charts.
BULL24|Again, the daily chart also looks good.
BEAR25|It has broke out of his trading range and it just barely broke this blue resistant line at 290.
BULL26|There was also very good volume buying.
NEUT27|However, we need to see if it holds above this level and if it pulls back, it needs to hold this 283 level which is around where we confirmed it with the weekly chart.
BULL28|Overall, I like Facebook on a fundamental level and now the technical charts are also indicating a potential buy.
BULL29|We just want to see if there's a pullback this week, and if it holds support then I would love to buy immediately.
NEUT30|Alternatively, if it breaks higher and stays above this 290 level on a weekly time frame, I can also see it being a goodbye.
NEUT31|That's all for today.
