NEUT0|"""Is now the time to like Facebook?"
NEUT1|You can tell me a lot more about Facebook than I can tell you.
NEUT2|At the same time, what do we know about Facebook?
NEUT3|We know that it's it's a giant in the world of social media, really.
NEUT4|One of the they call them, the fangs, the Great Four of the of that world, that space in investing.
NEUT5|But Facebook connects people, but it also connects merchants to people.
NEUT6|It connects you with your friends and your family.
NEUT7|But it also.
NEUT8|Influences in in both in a small way an in a large way.
NEUT9|What we think what we buy and what we say.
NEUT10|Facebook's had something of a rollercoaster ride since the pandemic crisis struck in February, March 2020.
NEUT11|Let's have a look at the chart and see what it says.
BULL12|You can see it was trading up around $220 a share.
BEAR13|It plunged to about 1:50 a share and now it's had a big rebound at the same time.
BEAR14|While it's rebounded, there have been calls to boycott Facebook that Facebook is somehow.
NEUT15|Not as acceptable socially, politically or otherwise as people think it might be.
NEUT16|Do I think Facebook belongs in your stock investing portfolio?
BULL17|Facebook has a lot of attractive qualities in terms of generating revenue, has a lot of cash on hand.
BULL18|It's a well managed.
NEUT19|You may not like what Facebook does.
NEUT20|You may not like what your friends post on Facebook.
NEUT21|You might not like a lot of things about Facebook that doesn't take away from the fact that it's got a hold on both the the stock market world but also the economic world.
NEUT22|One of the reasons not to on Facebook I would put at the top of the list for not owning Facebook.
NEUT23|It sells at 34 times earnings.
NEUT24|34 times earnings means you give them $34 of your investment capital and they give you $1.00 of earnings in return.
NEUT25|That's a big number of big multiple, and while Facebook may have some monopoly qualities, that makes it a very expensive stock, what are the reasons to own Facebook?
NEUT26|I would say the reason to own Facebook is it's something of a monopoly.
NEUT27|At this point you may not like what monopolies represent in a capitalist world.
NEUT28|Stifle competition?
BEAR29|Facebook certainly could be accused of stifling some of its competitors.
NEUT30|Maybe not in a legal sense, but perhaps in a economic or a moral sense.
NEUT31|At the same time, that provides a lot of revenue, advertisers everyday people in your lives are working as Salesman for Facebook.
NEUT32|To sum it up, Facebook represents an opportunity for investors, but maybe not at these prices.
NEUT33|At $238.00 a share.
NEUT34|Maybe too rich for your blood.
NEUT35|I think in the volatility of the virus world you may see Facebook at 180.
NEUT36|You may see Facebook at 160 and you may see Facebook at 400.
NEUT37|Stay tuned.
NEUT38|It'll be a wild ride.
NEUT39|That's all the time we have today on the investment advisor.
NEUT40|I'm your host.
NEUT41|Matthew Stevenson.
NEUT42|Remember, money can take care of you.
NEUT43|"It cannot take care of itself."""
