NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Katie Martin."
NEUT1|As you may have read online, I'm the Founder and Chief Investment Officer at Vomiting Camel Asset Management.
NEUT2|Except I'm not.
BEAR3|This whole thing has got out of hand.
NEUT4|The vomiting camel, a vomiting, camel vomiting camel.
NEUT5|This is how the vomiting camel works vomiting camel formation.
NEUT6|In the interests of fighting the scourge of fake news the FT needs to put the record straight.
NEUT7|This tail starts with technical analysis.
NEUT8|A very serious discipline for very serious people in financial markets that involves looking at charts, drawing lines on the charts, spotting patterns in the charts, and deciding that the patterns mean that the market is heading either up or down our head and shoulders pattern bearish death cross super bearish and ichimoku cloud well, the market must be range bound, Cup and handle formation.
NEUT9|Now that's bullish.
NEUT10|I'm not even joking.
NEUT11|So a few years ago I started drawing vomiting camels.
NEUT12|On to chance their bearish you know and tweeting them out just for fun.
NEUT13|It's just a joke to my genuine surprise, some people seem to have taken this a little too seriously in 2014.
BEAR14|CNBC pointed out that a vomiting camel formation had appeared in gold account will then go off the Cliff into the splat zone.
NEUT15|Now Bitcoin enthusiasts have picked up on that report and describing me online as the head of vomiting camel asset management.
NEUT16|But even teaching people to spot the pattern for themselves, your first hump of the camel right now, the second hub.
NEUT17|Then it just starts throwing up the serious lesson here is to take pretty patterns drawn on charts with a bit of a pinch of salt.
NEUT18|Personally, I'm wondering how to put the vomit back in the camel.
NEUT19|"I fear it may be too late."""
