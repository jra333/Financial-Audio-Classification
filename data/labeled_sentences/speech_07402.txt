NEUT20|Alright about oops at the dollar high.
NEUT21|There you go.
NEUT22|Square is similar to PayPal.

NEUT24|In that report, analysts expect Square post earnings of $0.20 per share.
BULL25|This would mark year over growth of 1100%.
NEUT26|In terms of valuation, Square is currently trading at a forward PE of 195 for comparison.
NEUT27|Its industry has an average forward PE of 59.91 which means square is trading at a premium to the group.

BULL32|There we go much better long term, beautiful upward trend.
NEUT33|Lately we've seen a correction so we're just going to get a little closer and see what that looks like here.
BULL34|And we've got a little forward looking triangle here square seen up to us high lately of 282 per share.
BULL35|We have a really very strong support at 200.
NEUT36|With this forward looking triangle coming together, price targets at 2:15 and 270 my by target on this is anywhere between 200 and 2:20, so anywhere in here.
BULL37|A is goodbye in my opinion.
BEAR38|Product stack right now is 229, so you look for a down day to look for opportunity to buy.
BULL39|On the upside, I believe both of these are great price targets.
