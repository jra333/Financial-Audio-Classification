NEUT0|"""Not all that long ago, if you wanted to get around in the city, your two main options for public transportation or hailing a taxi."
NEUT1|But then came Uber.
BULL2|The young company dominates the US ridesharing industry with nearly 60% market share.
BULL3|And has expanded its business into 65 countries around the globe.
BULL4|Ridesharing is poised to grow into a $133 billion industry by 2023 and Uber is well positioned to benefit.
NEUT5|In this video, we're going to break down exactly how Uber makes its money by getting millions of riders to their destinations everyday.
NEUT6|Huber makes money every time a rider opens.
NEUT7|The company's app hails a driver and pays for a ride and the company has a lot of riders to make money off of.
NEUT8|Uber's ride sharing business operates in more than 700 cities.
NEUT9|Across six continents and has 91 million monthly active users on its platform.
BULL10|In 2018, Boobers bookings, which is the amount the company collects from riders before it has to pay its drivers and other fees, totaled $50 billion, up 45% from the year before.
BULL11|From those bookings, the company generated $11.3 billion in revenue, a 43% increase from 2017.
NEUT12|But if the company had 50 billion in bookings but only brought in 11.3 billion in sales, where did all that money go?
NEUT13|Uber's business couldn't exist without its drivers, who work as independent contractors for the company and complete 14 million trips every day.
NEUT14|Uber pays them, along with other expenses, to keep its business running across the globe when all of its expenses are totaled up, an additional income.
BEAR15|Added in Uber lost 1.8 billion in 2018, while Uber isn't profitable right now, the company's loss of $1.8 billion in 2018 is an improvement from its adjusted loss of $2.2 billion in 2017.
BULL16|Additionally, Uber is looking to other businesses outside of ridesharing to drive growth.
NEUT17|One such business is the company's food delivery service.
NEUT18|Uber eats, which accounted for 12% of the company's total sales in 2018.
BULL19|The service is available in 500 cities globally, and Uber says it's the largest meal delivery platform in the world outside of China.
NEUT20|Based on its gross bookings.
BULL21|This small business could be an important one for Uber because it helps the company diversify its revenue and tap into the vast growing food delivery market.
NEUT22|Huber also runs a business that pairs shippers and truckers together called Uber Freight.
BULL23|The company is still working to expand the business, but it's an early indication that Uber aims to be a transportation platform and not just a ride sharing company.
NEUT24|Additionally, the company is developing autonomous vehicle technologies and has a small fleet of self driving vehicles on the road in Pittsburgh.
BULL25|Autonomous vehicles could eventually help Uber lower expenses and increase rides, though the mass rollout of this technology is still years away.
BEAR26|While Uber has built itself into a ridesharing powerhouse, the company still faces stiff competition.
BULL27|Lyft Uber's rival in the US has about 39% of the market right now, and while Ubers entered many international markets, its success abroad is anything but guaranteed.
NEUT28|So rider fees or how Uber makes most of its money but keep an eye on how the company expands Uber eats and its other businesses as well.
