NEUT0|"""Alright, so I wanted to make a quick video on AMC really quick can break this down because they did clothes at $9.02."
BULL1|If you were wondering and the after hours market right now they're sitting at $9.50, they just jumped again, but they're up 5%.
BULL2|They're making a pretty decent move in the after hours market and I think it's going to be really good.
BULL3|I think we're going to find a way to recover.
NEUT4|I did see something from the Discord group that I wanted to share here before we end this quick video.
NEUT5|It's just this little snippet here talking about how another institution got into AMC.
NEUT6|And they bought basically 90K worth of AMC and they wouldn't jump into a sinking ship.
NEUT7|So everybody really just stay calm.
BULL8|It's going to be something that does increase quite a bit.
NEUT9|If you want to join this Discord Group, make sure you check out the link in the description, but it's going to be really, really good and you could see the growth that we're seeing here, and we're going to see nothing but good growth.
NEUT10|Probably for the next couple of days.
NEUT11|"Hopefully this week, but it could end up being next week."""
