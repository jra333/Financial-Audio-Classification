NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys, it's your boy will be talking about the HIV."
NEUT1|I would give you guys some key supporters at levels where I see price going.
BULL2|It is a big week next week for GHI Vy so we want to try to get in on a decent play to get that run up.
NEUT3|And if it does come down we always use risk management so if it goes down it really doesn't bother us.
NEUT4|We just get out to play and we look for the next one.
NEUT5|Never get hung up on one play.
NEUT6|There is thousands of stocks to play.
NEUT7|OK, so make sure you got like the video.
NEUT8|Turn on post notifications so you don't miss any updates on any stocks that I posted that subscribe button.
NEUT9|And also if you want to know what I'm buying and selling stocks, my Patreon link is down below.
NEUT10|And also if you want to support the channel there is a option on Patreon link.
NEUT11|I think it's like 2-3 dollars online.
NEUT12|You know if you like my videos I would really appreciate it.
NEUT13|So let's get into the video.
NEUT14|This was my first support that I want to see how price reacted.
BEAR15|This level was $12.54 and as you can see it bounced off.
NEUT16|Here.
NEUT17|It came back up, came down, traded in a range, trade it all through here, tried to do it again and then this day Friday it dropped through and this defense right here.
NEUT18|1228 is my last was my last defense.
BEAR19|If it broke that and start coming down then I would have turned bearish.
NEUT20|And then I would have saw price around the $11.00 area, but it didn't.
BEAR21|It came down there and quickly rejected it.
BULL22|So that is a good sign for next week.
NEUT23|I think the stock is waiting for next week 'cause as you can see it had the quick run up and you know quick run out.
NEUT24|We look for the down movement right?
BEAR25|So this was a healthy downtrend.
BULL26|This is a healthy downtrend for a healthy uptrend.
BEAR27|OK so This is why I was I am still bullish on G HIV because it had the downtrend after this uptrend and now it's trading sideways.
NEUT28|So I think it is waiting for next week on Wednesday January 20th.
NEUT29|There is a lot of news on that day.
NEUT30|I also just realized that's the Inauguration day so that they're going to be jam packed for more.
NEUT31|Specifically, the HIV has their meeting and whether it's if it's going to be good news, the stock will take off.
BEAR32|If it's bad news, the stock will drop, so make sure you have risk management so you don't get caught any of that.
NEUT33|And if it does go down, you're not really worried about it.
NEUT34|So this is how I'm playing it.
NEUT35|I'm really just watching it for next week.
NEUT36|I wanted to hold both of these levels and then I wanted to break through this resistance right?
BULL37|And tested that support an I wanted to run through here.
NEUT38|Don't make new highs yet.
NEUT39|Come back down and then you can really get in to see higher prices.
NEUT40|Before January 20th, OK.
BULL41|So hope you guys like this video.
