BULL0|"""So you gotta wonder if their stocks can maintain this kind of momentum, but you're going to see if we're right in conjunction with the election."
NEUT1|So what do we have to do?
NEUT2|But we have to be dispassionate about it.
NEUT3|We gotta go off the charts, taking a close look at semiconductor capital equipment place without Bob Lang.
NEUT4|He's the founder of explosive options.net.
NEUT5|He's a brilliant technician, All Star duobehindthestreet.com's trifecta stocks newsletter, and he's also the author of a book called Know Your Options.
NEUT6|So I'm going to start.
NEUT7|By the way, these these charts are spectacular, OK?
NEUT8|I mean, they're unbelievable.
NEUT9|And if you don't know about him, your.
NEUT10|You're missing out on a lot, but this is the chart of Lamb research Elks, which is the old novellus merged with Lamb Research run by a guy from the Bellas Tim Archer air.
NEUT11|By of these, the successor to Tyreek Hill in the last few weeks.
BULL12|This stock has surged from 3:30 to 4:30.
NEUT13|Look at this move with three weeks.
BULL14|It's now far above where it was trading in February before the Covid collapse far above.
NEUT15|It might fix.
NEUT16|This chart is a thing of beauty.
BULL17|Lambs made a series of higher highs.
BULL18|Higher lows, strong volume.
NEUT19|Look at this.
NEUT20|Spray kit.
NEUT21|Is a textbook example of a very bullish pattern, even though, as I think you might be saying well, wait a second.
BEAR22|It's looking for a fall in late October land pulled back to its 50 day moving average.
NEUT23|That's a short term measure of the stocks trajectory 50 day and then immediately rebounded like crazy.
BULL24|I mean, that's another strong sign.
BEAR25|However, there's such a massive move, Lang thinks Ram Lamb is due for a temporary pullback.
NEUT26|Fact would be surprised if it comes down to the 400 level.
BULL27|But if that pullback happens, he expects land to make another incredible comeback, just like when it bounced off the 50 day.
BEAR28|And that's really pretty weak.
NEUT29|And this is what's really important is what he's saying basically?
NEUT30|Is this pattern off the 50 week is going to happen again, except for the 50 week by that point will be up there.
NEUT31|Nice after that pit stop.
NEUT32|He's thinking it's smooth sailing to 500 bucks.
BEAR33|That is some serious upside.
BULL34|If he's right, you have prepared to buy the dip and I think the business is going to be very good so they can make that happen.
NEUT35|I just hope plan gives you that pullback cut report aghbal quarter for guidance and a week later they rolled out $5 million pie pack.
BULL36|And we know that China opportunity could be enormous.
NEUT37|Five $3 billion but never cut their buybacks.
NEUT38|I like the stock.
BEAR39|In fact, this talk him down 7 bucks today, but I'd like it even more if it keeps falling.
