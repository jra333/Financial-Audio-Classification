BULL0|"""Let us give thanks that the Pilgrims embraced free markets."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
NEUT2|We get the insights you need to help navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT3|Most of us are familiar with the story, the origins of Thanksgiving, of how 400 years ago the pilgrims fleeing religious persecution arrive on the Mayflower at what became to be called Plymouth Rock.
BULL4|The first winner was harsh, but with help from local Native Americans, the survivors learn effective farming techniques.
NEUT5|The resulting harvest is celebrated with a feast that subsequently came to be called Thanksgiving.
NEUT6|But contrary to the legend, the harvest was not bountiful.
BEAR7|In fact, the Plymouth Colony nearly collapsed severe food shortages and discontent were widespread.
NEUT8|The problem, as described by the colony's governor William Bradford was the system.
NEUT9|The colonists initially operated under today.
NEUT10|We'd call it socialism or communism.
NEUT11|All property was communally owned and cultivated, no privately owned land.
NEUT12|Food and clothing were distributed equally to all.
NEUT13|Those who worked hard and efficiently received no more than those who are lager did nothing at all.
BEAR14|Women were assigned to do communal chores, which they bitterly resented.
BEAR15|Destitute settlers soon began to sell what little they had to get food.
NEUT16|They begged the local tribes to do chores for a quote cap full of corn and of quote, then Bradford in the colonies.
NEUT17|Other leaders radically change things.
NEUT18|Each family was given their own parcel of land.
NEUT19|Whatever was grown was theirs to do with as they saw fit.
NEUT20|Forced communal labor went out within a short period of time.
NEUT21|Shortages turned into abundance.
NEUT22|That colony soon had a Sir plus of corn.
BEAR23|The experience of the Plymouth Colony was not unique in those times that Jamestown settlement in Virginia, for example, originally had economic arrangements similar to those of the Pilgrims in Massachusetts with equally dismal results.
NEUT24|Then, after what was called the starving Winter Jamestown switch to free markets and food became plentiful.
BULL25|By liberating human creativity and enabling people to discover and fully develop their talents, free markets produce prosperity.
NEUT26|While socialism sinks a society into misery.
NEUT27|Yet the lessons of Plymouth and Jamestown, not to mention the more modern and ghastly ones of the Soviet Union, Maoist China, Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea are lossed on the far left of the Democratic Party, which assumes the prosperity just happens that taxes and regulations really don't matter.
BEAR28|If the economy slows, it could be revved up by government spending with money created out of thin air by the Federal Reserve.
NEUT29|So let us not forget the hard won wisdom of the Pilgrims.
NEUT30|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT31|Thank you for listening to send in your comments and suggestions.
BULL32|"I look forward to being with you soon again."""
