NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to another dividend Express Video today.
NEUT2|We're going to be talking bout KO stock symbol Ko for Coca Cola.
NEUT3|Is it a good time to buy?
NEUT4|Should you buy?
NEUT5|Why should you buy pretty much?
NEUT6|That's what we're going to be talking about.
NEUT7|Before we get into that, if you're interested in three free stocks into my channel, new to investing, skip to the end, watch old video, I'll talk about it then.
NEUT8|OK, so.
NEUT9|K oh, for starters, we're going to Scroll down and see that they have a dividend yield of 3.46%.
NEUT10|This isn't a fantastic dividend yield by any means, but it's a pretty expensive stock and pretty pretty pretty mediocre dividend yield.
BULL11|But it's still only one of them managed to make me $0.41, so that's still pretty pretty Dang good.
NEUT12|Other than that, I that's if you're looking for dividends it it's just one.
NEUT13|If you're looking to add diversity to your portfolio, as you can see, it's 3.23 point four 2% of mine.
NEUT14|If we look at the five year graph, the one year graph, we can see February right about when everyone else is stocks drop 'cause of the wires?
NEUT15|So did Coca Cola's?
BEAR16|They didn't drop a **** ton.
BEAR17|Loads of 27% down $13.00 of the year.
BEAR18|So they really dropped from where they were at kind of steady from 60 to like 46.
BEAR19|So a drop of 14 bucks.
NEUT20|Almost an.
NEUT21|Well, that's to where they are now.
BEAR22|It was a drop of the 23 so we can see that that's pretty good in it of itself, because it it should grow theoretically.
NEUT23|Overtime.
NEUT24|Give it time, and while you're holding on to it, it's paying you dividends.
NEUT25|So in my opinion.
NEUT26|As it still stands this stock.
BEAR27|Especially after this drop right here.
BULL28|Is a good buy.
NEUT29|Once again, I'm not sure how long it will stay this way, but I think it's a good good stock to jump into right now.
NEUT30|They get some diversity.
