BEAR0|"""AMC, another one of those ones that were stuck in the down market, seems like everything really."
NEUT1|If you look at my watch list, everything is read.
BEAR2|The market just looks horrible.
NEUT3|Besides a couple of pieces.
BEAR4|But you can see that it was down.
BEAR5|It did fluctuate it.
NEUT6|Staying between that $10 mark that 9:50 and $10 mark nothing really lower than that.
NEUT7|But it is fighting has that buying power has that selling power.
BULL8|You can see that it still has a lot of strength in it.
NEUT9|It's not something that's completely sold off like some of the other ones.
BULL10|And just know that this does have more potential than anything really to squeeze, really to have that large push.
NEUT11|Not really a full squeeze, but have that large push you know up to 20 up to 30 up to $50.
NEUT12|I truly do believe in this position.
NEUT13|This is why hold over 1900 shares of this position itself, so I believe in it you should do not.
NEUT14|"Financial advice is merely just my opinion, but my opinion is that you should believe in it."""
