NEUT0|"""How much do you like Bitcoin is a tradeable asset right now relative to anything else you might punt on in this current environment."
NEUT1|Listen, it's amazing macro environment to be punting right now, right?
NEUT2|I mean, it just really is where we're entering a really cool era for macro.
NEUT3|I mean, it's not great for the world economy, but when the world economy goes through the convulsions it's going through, it's wonderful for macro.
NEUT4|And so let's, I think Bitcoin is less exciting to be fair, or crypto is less exciting now versus macro than it was two years ago.
NEUT5|Macro got quite boring for many years.
NEUT6|And Crypto was really exciting and now we're in this consolidation.
BULL7|I think the quality is going to be 3000 and 6000, and you know, hopefully next year we start seeing the move up where macro is excited.
NEUT8|Pro comes in many flavors, interest rate futures, commodities, currencies.
NEUT9|What is exciting listen?
BEAR10|We had oil fall from 80 to 50.
BEAR11|We've never had a fall like that with the Fed hiking rates.
NEUT12|the Fed is going to hike rates tomorrow.
NEUT13|Most likely should they like?
BULL14|I think they're still going to hike.
BULL15|I think they're going to hike.
NEUT16|And then say last night for awhile it's going to be not last April.
NEUT17|They're going to hike and then they're going to say it's going to be data specific, and we're starting to get worried about the economy and so they'll be very dovish.
BULL18|But will be in dovish hike.
NEUT19|But so he's right.
NEUT20|In this environment, everything seems like a loser.
NEUT21|And if you believe that Bitcoin will be trading between 3000 and 6000 may not be a bad price point to increase your position, or to carefully watch because.
NEUT22|Like I said, we still don't know what the bottom is and it could continue to dip and you have to be comfortable with it, but eventually crypto will hit the floor and if you've watched the previous video, there are some very large institutions and universities that are investing in the crypto infrastructure.
BEAR23|So you're not going to be the only one investing in cryptocurrencies, but there's a 10 year track record of crypto currencies and it hasn't gone to zero previously, so I know there's flooding the market and people are still spooked about the outlook of.
BULL24|CS, but I do believe that time has tested the price of crypto's numerous times and they've recovered and if you can hold an continue to buy this dip, I think you will be rewarded.
NEUT25|"But let me know your thoughts on this and I will talk to you soon."""
