NEUT0|"""Hello I want let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see from this daily chart here."
BULL1|I had Friday trading time need formed a green candle and this candle is a higher than the last candle and it has moved higher away from the bottom heat at the.
NEUT2|21st of September.
BEAR3|And then in the chart we can see roughly hold a consolidation area here, and if you check the volume, the volume is roughly a smaller than last.
NEUT4|Kindle, so it's likely for Apple stock to consolidate here in this area, but we can see when it touched the 20 days.
BULL5|Yeah, may it retreat.
NEUT6|So it means there's still a lot of pressure upset.
BULL7|So in my opinion for Apple stock, it's very likely it will make a consolidation here, but not go back up so quickly.
NEUT8|So don't go back to the market.
BEAR9|"Too early, so that would avoid a further job, thank you."""
