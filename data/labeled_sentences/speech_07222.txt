BULL0|"""Apple hitting new all time highs's at the top of the Dow today."
NEUT1|Tony Saginaw Guy joins us.
BEAR2|He's a senior research analyst at Bernstein downgraded the stock to market, perform just two weeks ago with a $400 price target.
NEUT3|Tony, I know you also move the lower on Tesla.
BEAR4|Both stocks have been surging on the back of their announced stock splits.
NEUT5|You think that's a coincidence or or is that really what's been?
NEUT6|Do you think the driver of the shares?
BULL7|No, I think if we look at the both stocks over the last, you know, since the beginning of the year there's been very strong fundamental performance and you know recently we've had some tail.
BULL8|When you know, following the stock split announcement but, but that's sort of the cherry on top of the cake, I think to their credit, both are executing well.
NEUT9|Apple is, I think, being increasingly viewed in a different light.
NEUT10|It was viewed as sort of a a more cyclical hardware company, and there were worries that it would not.
BULL11|Yeah, well during this pandemic and it's going to grow earnings about 10% this year and and it has a big potentially big iPhone cycle coming up.
NEUT12|So there's the companies executed.
BULL13|Well, I think it's demonstrating that its services value proposition means that it's somewhat of a different company than perhaps some people believe, and there's anticipation that you know next year could be another Goodyear.
BEAR14|So all those things have contributed to run up in the stock.
NEUT15|And and again, I would view the stock split for both Apple and.
NEUT16|Tesla's is sort of the the cherry on top of the cake at this point, but but but a cherry that really adds much flavor to the cake?
NEUT17|Or is it totally superficial?
BULL18|Because I guess after apples quarter and you came on and joined us that week, there was definitely a lot of positive fundamentals people could point to that justified the big jump we saw in the share price.
NEUT19|But when you see, Tesla jumped 15% in two days after announcing his stocks, but it does make you think was the jump in Apple share price purely superficial based off of?
NEUT20|Offered zone announcement of stocks but.
NEUT21|Yeah, look, I think Tesla's following tends to be more individual investors and.
NEUT22|And you know, if I if I would use the term cult like and so I think to the you know potentially to that constituent base.
BULL23|The stock split is viewed more constructively I, I think in Apple's case, where it's such an enormous capitalization stock.
NEUT24|It's critical to almost every investors benchmark.
NEUT25|You know they they would discount the stock split and in terms of not really adding fundamental value to the shares.
NEUT26|They really were rewarding Apollon unless he said, well, friend or a really strong quarter and.
NEUT27|And so I, I think the investor base and who the stock appeals to is a little bit different for Tesla on balance than it is for Apple.
BEAR28|"And that's why I think you saw an outsized return on the split announcement for Tesla and Apple's, I think was was much more about fundamentals."""
