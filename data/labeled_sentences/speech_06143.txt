NEUT0|"""Investors take note."
BEAR1|More government spending won't save the economy.
NEUT2|In fact, just the opposite.
NEUT3|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL4|We get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world.
BULL5|Democrats are ready to push through a near $2 trillion spending bill that will supposedly Rev up an economy recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.
BEAR6|This legislation, however, will do more harm than good for two big reasons.
NEUT7|Reason 1.
NEUT8|Government spending doesn't stimulate the economy.
NEUT9|That's because politicians get the money in one of two ways, by taxes or by borrowing.
NEUT10|In other words, they're taking what already exists and redistributing it.
NEUT11|They aren't creating anything new.
BULL12|If lots of spending lead to long term growth and prosperity, the Soviet Union would have won the Cold War.
NEUT13|France would be.
BULL14|Economic Colossus more powerful than the US.
BEAR15|Instead, it's been a laggard for decades thanks to bloated budgets and excessive taxes.
NEUT16|Ever since the Great Depression of the 1930s, it has been wholly read among all too many economists that economies prosper when politicians shovel out lots of cash.
NEUT17|Actual real-world experience shows that to be false time and time again.
BEAR18|The spending bills passed last year responding to the sudden COVID-19 cause lockdowns.
NEUT19|They weren't stimulus measures, but rather emergency life lines.
BEAR20|Reason two more government spending means more borrowing by Uncle Sam, and this will lead to a nasty outbreak of price inflation that will batter stocks and smother the economy.
NEUT21|Washington borrows money by selling bonds.
NEUT22|If the Federal Reserve buys bonds, it pays for them by creating money out of thin air.
BEAR23|That's what the Fed has been doing since the pandemic, and this will lead to an outbreak of inflation.
BEAR24|Excessive money printing is what happened during the great inflation of the 1970s that saw consumer prices soar and interest rates reach a high of 21 1/2%.
NEUT25|And home mortgage is 18%.
NEUT26|What makes this new spending bill especially unnecessary?
NEUT27|Is that Washington still hasn't spent some $1 trillion from the previous legislation?
BULL28|That's right one trillion trillion with a T. That's enough to pay for more and needed help for hard hit businesses like restaurants, movie theaters, hotels and airlines, and more for distributing vaccines and other pandemic related expenses.
NEUT29|Given political realities, there will be a new bill, but it should limit itself to another round of individual checks.
NEUT30|This act would be a one shot and would not distort the labor markets.
NEUT31|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL32|"Thank you for listening to send in your comments and suggestions and look forward to being with you soon again."""
