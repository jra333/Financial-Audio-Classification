BULL0|"""Good evening, Youtubers fry."
NEUT1|I just wanted to do a quick video because it is the end of the financial year for investing.
NEUT2|So today's the last day that you can whack money in your eyes are if you have a nicer oversee the allowance which is £20,000 refresh is tomorrow.
NEUT3|So anybody that's maxed out of fatigue and start investing again.
NEUT4|Or anybody that hasn't maxed out.
NEUT5|If you do have any spare pennies now is your opportunity to put them in?
NEUT6|If that's what you choose to do.
NEUT7|Obviously, as I say, pretty much in all of my videos and in the description below, these are educational or entertainment purposes only.
NEUT8|Should not be used as advice.
NEUT9|I am just a guard YouTube making videos about his own journey and own stock portfolio, so you shouldn't.
NEUT10|Necessarily for allowing me for advice.
BULL11|With that said, I just wanted to touch on something quickly, so today I did stick some extra funds into my ice are just to cheer up a bit of the allowance.
NEUT12|Haven't quite got all the funds to chart the 20,000, bearing in mind only started this in December, but I've also got some property deals that I need to complete on and follow through so need to retain some funds for those.
NEUT13|But one thing I did want to quickly touch on was a NAG&C.
BULL14|So I've made a another round of funding onto that to take total shares up to 161 shares, which should be, roughly speaking, about £12 a month dividend payment.
NEUT15|So quite a fair significant amount.
BULL16|We're talking over £120.00 a year in dividend payments, plus obviously the company is reasonably good return for me, giving quite a healthy return.
BULL17|Obviously I've dollar cost averaged up a little bit here.
BEAR18|But it's going to turn off percent return.
NEUT19|Plus obviously 12 month dividend payment, which shouldn't be comes in around the middle of the month.
NEUT20|The significance of this, as I have mentioned in previous videos, is that £12 dividend actually currently buys pretty much another share.
NEUT21|So every single month I will get a free share.
NEUT22|Affectively 12 free shares a year, which will then self grow and self fund because for every share that I get I get a small dividend payment.
NEUT23|So that's a quick video today just to let you know what I've been up to.
NEUT24|If you do like the video, please do subscribe.
NEUT25|Don't forget to smash the like button and Notification Bell and all that kind of stuff 'cause YouTube like that an if you want to leave a comment below please do so let me know what you been buying today.
NEUT26|So if you stuck any money in whether it's just cash funds to spend at a later date.
NEUT27|Or whether you purchased a whole lot of things over the weekend or early last week.
NEUT28|"With that said, I'll see you next time."""
