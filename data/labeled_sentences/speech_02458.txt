NEUT0|"""We win no matter what got money on my mind."
NEUT1|Everybody hey investors Muzzey here today.
NEUT2|Today I sold out of our Disney position at around 5% gain and I wanted to tell you guys why.
NEUT3|I'm also going to give an in depth analysis of the company.
BEAR4|First let me say that I'm going extremely cash heavy, not only because of the Mexican alcohol, but because it's an election year and the stock market is higher than ever.
BULL5|I mean, just in our Robin Hood portfolio were up 78% this year.
NEUT6|Now I could make a whole video telling you why we need to be cash heavy.
NEUT7|But today we're going to talk about why I decided to sell my Disney shares.
NEUT8|Disney actually seems to be a good time to buy right now.
BULL9|Theme parks are scheduled to reopen this weekend and will very possibly make shares go up in the short term.
NEUT10|Also, Disney's move into the streaming industry is huge for the long term and just April of 2020, Disney reported 50 million subscribers to Disney Plus and they have yet to open the streaming service in Eastern Europe and Latin America.
NEUT11|Disney also owns a 70% stake in Hulu.
NEUT12|Giving their monopoly of streaming a whole new dimension, the company also is really monopolized on their big acquisitions.
NEUT13|Marvel Star Wars and 21st Century Fox, just to name a few.
NEUT14|I've always been somewhat bullish on Disney and still am for the long term.
NEUT15|So why did I sell out of it?
BEAR16|Well, to start off on our list of cons, Disney suspended their dividend indefinitely and I don't blame them.
BULL17|They really need all the money they can get right now to stay afloat.
NEUT18|But as an investor I'd rather hold a stock long term that I'm able to get a steady dividend out of.
NEUT19|As opposed to just riding the tide, especially in these uncertain times.
BEAR20|And although Disney's expansion through acquisitions is what I love about the company, it also comes with a negative.
NEUT21|As of May 2020, Disney's long term debt amounts to over $55 billion or about 1/4 of the value of the company.
NEUT22|And while this debt load isn't completely out of whack, especially when we compare it to other large companies, I also took into account how Corona hit Disney's business model on nearly all levels.
BEAR23|If we take a look at this graph, we see that theme parks make up about 33% of total revenue and not only was this a complete zero in revenue for a long period this year, but they also had to pay all of the bills an employees during that time, meaning they went negative on 1/3 of what is supposed to be their revenue.
BEAR24|Disney's Holdings in ESPN Sports and other cable networks also make up about 21% of their revenue, and this metric was hit by Corona as well because you don't have sports on TV at the moment.
BEAR25|This means that Disney is paying $55 billion in debt, while over 50% of their revenue is being completely destroyed by Rhona.
BEAR26|Not to mention that new releases are being put on hold because movie theaters are completely shut down, so no box office hit is going to save the company either.
BEAR27|Also, Disney plan to expand their multi billion dollar cruise line this year, but with nearly all cruises being affected with the recent pandemic, this is yet another area where their business took a massive hit.
NEUT28|And now we've got a bunch of cruise ships that are just huge bills at the moment, and taking in no profit.
BULL29|The only saving grace I see for this stock is that their direct consumer market, which only made up 9% of their revenue in quarter one of 2020, I'm sure is going to grow huge.
NEUT30|They're moving to the streaming space, really.
NEUT31|Is their only saving grace, and they did it at a perfect time.
BEAR32|My overall review of Disney is that mid term things look fairly bleak.
NEUT33|I'm going to try and get in at a lower price, however.
BULL34|Because I do feel that Disney is a great buy long term.
