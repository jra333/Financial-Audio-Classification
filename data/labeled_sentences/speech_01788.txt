NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead."
NEUT1|Is this the time to buy gold?
BEAR2|After all gold prices have been moving up while stocks have suffered.
NEUT3|If you'd put say $10,000 in the stock market a year ago, you'd have about $9000 today.
NEUT4|If you'd put that $10,000 in gold, you would have $13,500 today.
NEUT5|That's over 4000.
BULL6|$500 since stocks reached their high in February, gold is outperformed them by a good margin.
NEUT7|Well, gold is a hedge, a hedge against government blunders, printing too much money, or doing other things that hurt their economies and currencies.
NEUT8|And that's what people fear today.
BULL9|the US is spending trillions of dollars printing up trillions of dollars to save our battered economy from COVID-19.
BEAR10|Is this going to lead to a crisis down the road as happened in the 1970s or early 2000s when gold last went up sharply?
NEUT11|That's the worry.
NEUT12|That's why the yellow metal is moving up in price, so yes, you should put some money into gold, but only a fraction of your portfolio say 10% no more than 10%.
NEUT13|Why?
NEUT14|Because gold is not an investment.
NEUT15|It's not like a buying into a company that makes a product or a service.
NEUT16|Gold is just a piece of metal.
NEUT17|But you have it as a hedge like home insurance or auto insurance against governments making mistakes.
NEUT18|The thing is, and this will sound Pollyannaish, but it is true.
NEUT19|U.S. stocks always come back from disasters without exception.
BULL20|Look at the early 1930s, the worst the Great Depression stocks at fallen almost 90% today they are significantly higher, outperforming bonds outperforming gold or silver over the period of time since.
NEUT21|So the bottom line is put some money into gold.
NEUT22|It is a great hedge against stupidity by our governments.
BULL23|But good things are going to be done.
NEUT24|We're going to have in this country, even though most people don't realize it yet.
BEAR25|We're going to get a payroll suspension, a moratorium on payroll taxes, which will give typical workers are three to $4000 raise and lower the price of hiring people.
NEUT26|Keeping people on the payroll.
NEUT27|There will be more deregulation, so the real bottom line is, watch the election.
BULL28|If we get a government next year that is committed to reducing taxes and removing burdens on businesses, especially small businesses, by golly, stocks will really come roaring back.
NEUT29|If not, then you'll be glad you bought some gold as a hedge.
BULL30|Expect the price to go up some more, perhaps, but it'll only be temporary if we do the right things economically.
NEUT31|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT32|Thank you for listening.
BULL33|"Look forward to talking with you soon again."""
