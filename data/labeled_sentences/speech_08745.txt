NEUT0|"""CNBC conducted a survey among twenty US strategies to get their sense on how they're preparing for the election risk and the impact it can have."
NEUT1|The election outcome that is on the market at end of 2020 and here are the survey results.
NEUT2|And remember, this was an email survey and strategists included essentially wealth managers buy side participants as well as sell side participants.
NEUT3|So this is a key finding from the survey 14 out of 20 strategists expect a Biden victory, which is pretty much sorry.
NEUT4|In tandem with what we've seen.
BULL5|In the national polls, the latest national polls out in the US suggesting a leaning towards Biden win come November 2020.
NEUT6|Flip over and take a look at some of the other findings from the survey.
BEAR7|10 of 20 strategists believe that the S&P 500 would fall post the election risk and they tie it in with a Biden victory because they expect.
NEUT8|Of course, Biden's tax policy is to not be that favorable for market sentiment over there.
BEAR9|Most analysts believe that five to 10% fall could be in the works, depending on whether the Democrats are able to take over the Senate if they do manage to do that.
BULL10|Then that would pave the way for policy implementation on the tax reform from something that Biden has been very vocal about in his speeches in the DNC, gone by.
NEUT11|And of course, that would have that would lead the way for Biden to implement his differential tax reform that he's been talking about for awhile.
NEUT12|As far as a trumpet trees concern.
BULL13|Again, most analysts do not expect too much upside potential from here, unless did say that a 5% potential rally could be in the works if Trump were to take over office with the markets have moved so much.
BULL14|Already a 60% return coming in for the NASDAQ from Mid March.
BEAR15|Lows 4045% done for the S&P 500.
NEUT16|Pretty much pricing in the economic recovery in 2021 and 2022.
BEAR17|So the upside potential seems to be capped in the event of an event from either party or either candidate.
NEUT18|What was interesting that actually surprised me from the survey findings with the fact that a lot of analysts are still not too worried about a contested outcome.
NEUT19|Just as yet, and something that's not priced into the markets.
NEUT20|Most analysts are working with the assumption that.
NEUT21|If indeed that were to be the eventuality, then the downside risk for the market could be between 5 to 10%.
NEUT22|If they believe in the market, perceives that there is going to be a resolution inside.
BEAR23|If they do not think there's going to be a resolution inside, which essentially means that there could be a disorderly outcome where it's a close call between Trump and Biden, and that would lead to a vote recount, and perhaps the Supreme Court intervention, then that could just delay results, and that could just add to the uncertainty in the markets, paving the way for a more significant sell off.
BULL24|"10% plus could be in the works."""
