NEUT0|"""Hi this is Zachary Ratings by Andre where I do predictions."
NEUT1|Other feature.
NEUT2|If you like me to do prediction for you let me know in the comments below.
NEUT3|Today we're talking about Bitcoin Z or be Queens.
BULL4|Yep.
NEUT5|First thing that comes up with it's.
NEUT6|Quite a bit like Bitcoin.
NEUT7|The original, but they're calling themselves Bitcoin Point 2.0.
NEUT8|The first thought is OK, faster transactions which Bitcoin the original definitely needs.
NEUT9|And.
NEUT10|Anne.
NEUT11|Hiding your identity.
NEUT12|Which Bitcoin, the regular Bitcoin doesn't have.
BEAR13|It sounds like a good idea, but I'm getting the feeling that there's going to be some monkey business behind the scenes.
NEUT14|On this one.
NEUT15|From its team in the next 2-3 years.
NEUT16|It may not.
NEUT17|Become relevant until another five years until the Bitcoin.
NEUT18|The first one takes off, which it will 'cause of the economy is going to crash and it's going to bring Bitcoin up, right?
NEUT19|Wish I predicted in another video not that long ago.
NEUT20|So I don't see it.
NEUT21|I see it lasting the 10 years it definitely has or purpose of.
NEUT22|But it's some things that.
NEUT23|It's things that Bitcoin itself could do if they wanted to.
BULL24|But I could see it lasting the 10 years scalability.
NEUT25|They haven't really talked about that in their web page at all.
NEUT26|But I do see a scaling.
NEUT27|Just wonderfully, I don't see big money being made with this one, not for some time like most of the cryptocurrencies right now it's going to be awhile until we're going to see any gains.
NEUT28|Probably another year or two like big Games.
NEUT29|We just need that event to happen first.
BULL30|But overall I think this is a good project.
NEUT31|Very interesting website, not as boring as some type I've looked at and.
NEUT32|I've looked at a lot of coins in the last year.
NEUT33|An.
NEUT34|I do think money will be made with this one, but it won't be for at least for the five years after the big coins have gone up.
NEUT35|Then probably drag some of the smaller coins along with it, OK?
