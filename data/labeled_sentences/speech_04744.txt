BULL0|"""Thanks for being here."
BULL1|You know, Amazon, you've been steadfast on the network on this show.
NEUT2|It sounds like you've never sell.
NEUT3|It's the one that you own for the kids forever.
BULL4|The stocks up 30% of the year.
BULL5|It's up 50% from its March lows.
NEUT6|What do you think?
NEUT7|Investors just figured out?
NEUT8|Other than the obvious, and you think that there's a chance that after we reopen the economy, a lot of consumers want to buy local?
NEUT9|They want to support their local stores, and their neighbors were working in their stores.
NEUT10|That sort of thing.
BEAR11|And do you think the stock kind of finds a new level lower?
NEUT12|No, I think it goes up up, up, up, up.
NEUT13|I think it's exact opposite.
NEUT14|People who weren't comfortable dealing with Amazon for for consumables, for food, for produce, even.
NEUT15|I think they've gotten into that habit now and look Amazon Canon, keep up with their delivery.
NEUT16|I don't think that's going to slow down at all, and I think the greatest fear factor is going to be going back, not necessarily to the grocery stores.
NEUT17|I literally am just leaving our local grocery store, but to the small to medium sized businesses 'cause they don't know what protocols are in place to keep them as consumer states.
NEUT18|And so I think Amazon just takes off and you know, I read some stuff where they're looking at doing testing.
NEUT19|If you imagine if they provided free testing, just delivering to all their prime or just all their consumers, there's just.
NEUT20|There's just so many touch points that they have that are positive.
NEUT21|That I mean, I think.
NEUT22|You know it's only going to get.
BEAR23|That's only going to go up.
NEUT24|I mean, I can't.
NEUT25|I'm not going to do when, how or where, but it's going up more broadly mark when it comes to the stock market.
NEUT26|Are you finding any values out there?
NEUT27|I did originally about some Live Nation and I'm about break even with now.
BULL28|Actually, I'm a little bit up on it.
BULL29|I still have my Netflix that I've turned out to be really lucky there.
NEUT30|And beyond that, I'm just waiting.
NEUT31|I'm just not as confident as everybody else that this market is found a base.
NEUT32|I think we can go a little bit lower and you know, I'll be waiting and the other side of it is, I think in the private market there's going to be even more bargains.
NEUT33|And so while the public markets you know because of the Fed, there might be some a fed put there that that protects everybody.
BEAR34|The private markets, I think we're going to be a mess.
NEUT35|And I'm also, you know, trying to keep some cash there for that private markets.
NEUT36|Meaning private equity, VC pipes.
NEUT37|What sort of product?
NEUT38|It was some of those things, yeah, but just smaller businesses, medium sized businesses, you know, even large private companies that are looking for alternative funding real estate REITs, you know, private rates.
NEUT39|There's just so many different things that I think are going to be cash short.
BEAR40|And if the liquid doesn't flow the way the Fed expects it too will be a lot of deleveraging.
NEUT41|You mentioned rates.
NEUT42|Are you concerned about the real estate market and what area of the right market are you looking at?
NEUT43|Commercial retail storage?
NEUT44|I'm just looking.
NEUT45|I'm just looking.
NEUT46|I'm trying to get a feel for what America 2.0 is going to look like.
NEUT47|That's the uncertainty.
NEUT48|The only thing I know for certain is that we don't go back to business as usual.
NEUT49|You know, I think you know our large companies.
NEUT50|If they bring back 70% of their employees, I'd be thrilled to death medium sized the same way that introducing new technology.
NEUT51|I just there's so many variables that I just I don't want to rush into anything.
NEUT52|You know, there's a lot of speculation into warehouse.
NEUT53|We, you know, refrigerated warehouses.
NEUT54|And there's just so many industry specific things that I want to take a look at.
NEUT55|"But I want to get a sense for what happens on the other side first."""
