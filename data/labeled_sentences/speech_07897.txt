NEUT0|"""Elon Musk is the richest man in the world."
NEUT1|It's no secret that he's a fan of crypto and Doge coin is his favorite.
NEUT2|Pretty much every time he even mentions the word doge coin.
NEUT3|It seems to skyrocket, and today's episode I will tell you the latest thing that he said about Doge coin as well as my price prediction.
NEUT4|Let's talk money.
NEUT5|From my point of view, when Elon Musk tweets he's only being half serious.
NEUT6|I genuinely believe he does love doge coin.
NEUT7|I mean, come on, it's a pretty fun coin that you can buy a crap ton of even if you don't have that much money.
NEUT8|But he's definitely the richest man in the world for a reason.
NEUT9|He's a really smart guy that understands the kind of influence that he has some shirt every time he tweets about doge coin.
BEAR10|It's also a bit of a troll.
NEUT11|Mean it's hilarious, literally.
NEUT12|All he has to do is mention the word Doge coin, and it shoots up, but just because it's a troll, it doesn't mean that it still can make you richer.
NEUT13|Look at the latest thing that he tweeted on February 4th.
NEUT14|Elon declared himself the King of Doge coin that Doge coin is the people script, though that's literally all it took for Doge coin to skyrocket in just a few hours.
BULL15|Doge coin increase its price from four and a half cents to about $0.06.
NEUT16|Now I know what some of you guys are thinking.
NEUT17|One and a half cent increase isn't that big of a deal, but keep in mind the way to calculate your gains isn't through the price increase, it's actually little percentage gains.
NEUT18|So one and a half cent increase on an asset that's only worth four and a half cents is equivalent to an asset worth $100, increasing to $133.
BULL19|In other words, it's a 33% increase.
NEUT20|I'll tell you my strategy, but please don't take it as legal investment advice.
NEUT21|I'm just some random guy on the Internet, but this is what I'm doing.
NEUT22|I've been buying doge coin in dips dramatically and selling it when it soars dramatically.
NEUT23|I like to be transparent, so as proof.
NEUT24|Here's a screenshot.
BULL25|I bought $100 worth of Doge coin at 0.25 on January 30th and sold it at 0.43 for a 70% increase.
NEUT26|Unfortunately, I sold off a little early just a few hours before Elon's tweet, otherwise.
NEUT27|I could have made overall 100% return, but regardless a 70% return in the span of four days is nothing to complain about.
NEUT28|If you think what I'm investing in Dutch corn isn't a lot of money, that's because it's not like I've said before, risky investments should be seen as entertainment and that is a way to get rich quick.
BEAR29|I $100 investment is less than 1% of my investment portfolio, so I really wouldn't hurt that much if I were to lose it.
NEUT30|Many of my investments.
NEUT31|Aren't safer index funds or ETF's dogecoins?
BEAR32|Current prize is around .047 and I'm predicting another dip for debts under three cents.
NEUT33|I'll be buying more Doge coin this time.
NEUT34|I plan to put in $200 since Deutsch Corner solve.
NEUT35|Also, if you're patient enough, you can definitely make some moolah by buying at the lower support point and selling the higher resistance point.
