NEUT0|"""Straight over to CNBC headquarters to hang out with our friend Jim Cramer, see what he's thinking about before this market opens into Jim."
NEUT1|It does appear that it is going to open down.
NEUT2|Is this just a breather and and what do you make of what's happening in the market?
NEUT3|And then I don't even I. I'm trying still even a day later.
NEUT4|I know we talked about Bitcoin yesterday, but trying to make sense of where this is all headed.
NEUT5|Well, look, I think it's a worldwide were catching here.
NEUT6|There's need some more good news.
NEUT7|We don't have it we.
NEUT8|Still wanna know bout stimulus but the variance the vaccine variants that we're having trouble with I think are very much on people's minds.
NEUT9|Look, I happen to think that that Bitcoin is exciting.
NEUT10|It's something we can talk about endlessly.
NEUT11|Their promoters of it.
NEUT12|They don't seem to be a lot of sellers of it.
NEUT13|We're going to hear from PayPal on analyst meeting coming up about how it's begun to be mainstream, but I just think that in the end you have to have some sort of hedge on it.
NEUT14|'cause if you take it and it goes down, I think that you're going to end up saying why did I use Bitcoin when I could actually transacted?
NEUT15|Dollars, but as far as a way to be able to have a pastiche of things that you should do your cash with, I'm all for it.
BEAR16|I think it's almost irresponsible not to include it.
NEUT17|Every treasurer should be going to boards of directors, is saying should we put a small portion of our cash in Bitcoin?
NEUT18|It seems to be an interesting way to hedge against the rest of the environment.
NEUT19|Nice hedge against Fiat currency.
NEUT20|But that's the question, is it?
NEUT21|Is it really a hedge or is it?
NEUT22|Is it fundamentally actually tide to the quote unquote market right now and we've seen when the markets gone down but it's gone down as well?
NEUT23|Well, I believe in gold as a way to hedge.
NEUT24|I believe in selling calls against certain stocks is away the head, so I'm much more a traditional and so I think that it's just a piece of the puzzle.
NEUT25|I think the company should invest big.
NEUT26|I mean I think the Tesla put a lot of money in it.
NEUT27|That was I don't have that level of conviction, but I own Bitcoin.
NEUT28|I've owned Bitcoin for some time as an alternative that I used to always say I own some gold on some cash.
NEUT29|Now I say own some cash, own some gold and some Bitcoin.
NEUT30|It's a little inflated for day, but there's still plenty of people think it's going to 100,000 Novogratz was on everywhere saying it's going to 100,000.
NEUT31|"All I know is I think it's an alternative to having cash position where you make absolutely nothing."""
