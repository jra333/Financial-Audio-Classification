NEUT0|"""So if the business is great, if Benioff and Buffett both like it, then what am I doing saying?"
NEUT1|Maybe I'm a little nervous one word valuation.
BULL2|She originally Snowflake plan to come public 75 to $85 per share, but there's been so much demand that the bookrunners raised the price range dramatically.
NEUT3|Now they're talking 100 to $110 per share.
BEAR4|Unusual scene IPO price like that large.
BULL5|It's looking like the company will be able to raise somewhere between 3.5 to 4 billion.
NEUT6|And that assumes they don't upsize the deal.
BEAR7|Raised the price even further, and that's probably a bogus assumption.
NEUT8|At the low end of the range, my back of the envelope math says that this will be a $27.7 billion company from day one.
NEUT9|At the high end, we're talking 30.5 billion.
BULL10|Assuming Snowflake can keep growing at 133%, clip this year, reasonable, they'll have 615 million in revenues at the IPO price.
NEUT11|That means the stock will be valued at 45 to 50 times sales.
BULL12|Of course, if they can maintain a triple digit growth within the next couple of years, that stocks going to look a lot cheaper in the 2023 estimates, but that's a big if I've got today.
BEAR13|Even in a market that loves cloud stocks with rapid revenue growth and no earnings.
NEUT14|50 times sales is tough to swallow right now.
NEUT15|Zooms the most expensive cloud name in the market and it sells for 48 times this year.
NEUT16|Sales.
NEUT17|That's the upper end of the range.
NEUT18|You gotta assume that Snowflake will spike right out of the gate, which means it could be substantially more expensive than zoom before you get a chance to do anybody zoom.
NEUT19|So where do I come down?
BEAR20|Look, I am torn.
BULL21|I think still place is going to be a great long term performance.
NEUT22|I bet it will have a very strong first week, but the price of admission seems a little too extreme for me.
NEUT23|Unless you can get in on that deal.
NEUT24|Remember those who get stock will come in and buy more in the aftermarket and their cost basis will be lower than yours.
NEUT25|That if you came in in the public market.
BEAR26|That's why so many of the bars are insensitive pricing the first day they.
NEUT27|Let's say they gets 100,000 shares, which would be a lot and it comes public at 100 opens at 200.
NEUT28|Well they buy 102 and they get a basis of 150.
NEUT29|You gotta base in 200.
NEUT30|Here's the bottom line.
NEUT31|If you want a piece of snowflake and you can't get a piece of the actual IPO, I recommend waiting for the next tech pullback which we know we have.
BULL32|We had one last week 10%.
BEAR33|If we pull the trigger when this cloud stock sell off, they solve hard.
BULL34|So I have to believe you'll get a better entry point as long as your patient.
