NEUT0|"""So alright, tell us what's going on in India?"
NEUT1|How's that affecting the gold market?
NEUT2|Well, basically what happened last week was that engine budget.
BULL3|The Indian rather problem presented its budget for the year and they said in order to, you know, raise revenues and for a bunch of other reasons they're going to raise the import tax on gold and they've doubled it to 4%.
NEUT4|Now India is the world's largest market for gold 1000 metric.
NEUT5|Tons of gold were imported into India last year pretty much.
NEUT6|That's a lot of gold, right?
NEUT7|Huge cultural thing over there.
NEUT8|It's really.
NEUT9|It is much more so than here.
NEUT10|There's a huge cultural thing over their gifts for weddings, right, right, right, right?
NEUT11|So it's a very.
NEUT12|This was a really big deal.
BEAR13|Yeah, in India and they reacted very badly to it, didn't they?
NEUT14|Well basically the first thing that the Jewelers did was shut shop.
BEAR15|They said were protesting.
BEAR16|This is ridiculous.
BEAR17|It's going to kill our industry and what started off as a three day protest by by certain.
NEUT18|I think about half the Jewelers have decided to.
NEUT19|They shot through full week, so Saturday through Saturday.
NEUT20|So is it?
NEUT21|Is this sort of an overreaction, though, to what ultimately could be sort of just a nominal tax increase?
NEUT22|There was.
BULL23|There was a discussion of how this action by the by the Jewelers could actually lower gold prices and that could actually compensate a little bit for this.
BEAR24|So you know, is it a little bit of an overreaction.
NEUT25|Not if you talk to them.
NEUT26|I mean, if you take a step back from what's going on and you look at it, you know in very broad terms is India as a country going to stop buying gold.
NEUT27|You know, birthdays, weddings, you know other celebrations there still happening and you still need to give your wife something you know and it better not be a cell phone or just small.
NEUT28|Something like something small right instead of the you know, whatever quarter of an ounce of whatever it is because.
NEUT29|Any smaller now, let's talk about how this is affecting the Goldmark Goldmark have been pretty volatile last few months, right?
NEUT30|This is just one more thing adding to the volatility is that right?
NEUT31|Yeah, there's there's a lot of pressure on gold at the moment because we get it.
BEAR32|We've gotten some really bad data out of China in terms of manufacturing lately, and if the Chinese economy is not going well, well, maybe you know they'll have less money to buy gold.
NEUT33|It's it's a tough one to kind of categorically say they will, or they won't, but that's a worry.
NEUT34|With India adding this text, we you know and the jewel is being shut already.
BEAR35|Seeing demand we could this week, you know all the bullion banks are kind of saying look, the physical buying is quite weak out of Asia because India is kind of out of the market.
NEUT36|What happens when they come back next week?
NEUT37|What happens in a few, you know, as things go back to normal you know and and we really get to see the impact of this tax.
NEUT38|We're not sure, but right now on the.
BEAR39|You know, through yesterday, gold prices were down 4% on the month.
BULL40|They still up on the year, but you know, Donald yeah, volatility of all things, see right there, we got gold up 1% right now.
NEUT41|So hey, we'll see what happens there?
NEUT42|Tatiana shumsky.
BULL43|Thank you very much.
BULL44|"Have a good weekend."""
