NEUT0|"""Hey, what's everybody?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to brand new video instead with you, I'm going to go through six reasons why in to buy Facebook stock right now, so stay tuned about all those six residents and read on research before investing in any of those stocks on my channel.
NEUT2|Remember, as more new things, any stock market buys, the stock market is more profitable and give you more value and more out, better outcome.
NEUT3|That's what's happening with Facebook stock right now.
NEUT4|They're giving more our value as you guys can see there over.
NEUT5|If you guys go to their stock page there so high number one reason their small business relief program.
NEUT6|So they have a business relaxed program and that makes them their stock market profitable because more people invest into it and more people waste their time onto it.
NEUT7|Number two is Facebook shop.
NEUT8|If you guys do not, there's two different Facebook shops.
NEUT9|There is one the marketplace, but there's another one as well that makes it double the profit.
NEUT10|It's called Facebook Shop and it's you guys.
NEUT11|If you guys create a group, you guys can find that and you guys can sell stuff there and make the Facebook will make profit.
NEUT12|#3 is Facebook hub.
NEUT13|If you guys don't know, Facebook is one of the most popular social medias and that makes it the Facebook hub.
BULL14|It's one of the best social media and the most popular social media and that makes it more profitable for us.
NEUT15|Investors.
NEUT16|#4 Facebook recently purchase of 10% Markush Ambani's Reliance Jio.
NEUT17|So if you guys don't know Facebook just purchased 10% of market and what that gives us.
NEUT18|As I said at the start of videos more things their purchases more things they own that's more profitable for US investors.
NEUT19|#5 Facebook owns Oculus adds again they own akhlas that means they have more stuff into themselves and for US investors that means more better outcome, more value, more profit.
NEUT20|#6 Facebook will allow its employees to work from home so you guys are probably wondering what is this going to do without investors?
NEUT21|Well, one of their employees work from home.
NEUT22|What that gives us an opportunity is that they don't have to pay for their area where they stay in and that makes them Payless and investors will get more better outcome.
BULL23|Thanks for watching.
NEUT24|Share the video and I'll see you in the next one.
NEUT25|"Peace out."""
