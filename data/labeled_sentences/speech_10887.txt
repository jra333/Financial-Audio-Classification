NEUT0|"""What can you tell us what decision?"
NEUT1|What changes are Morgan Stanley and its team making here?
NEUT2|It's a pretty straightforward 41 Brian yeah, all across Wall Street.
NEUT3|We have these wirehouses whether there Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, Beebase, Meryl or UBS and you know they cater to people who are at least in this sort of single digit $1,000,000 asset class AUM class.
NEUT4|And for the most part these are people who are increasingly getting intrigued in Bitcoin.
NEUT5|You know they look at the charts as we've talked about on your shows before and you know they're intrigued and they want exposure and they want to do it through the safety of these.
NEUT6|Wealth management platforms that are obviously well regulated, well controlled, and you know Morgan Stanley being one of the biggest, if not the biggest with four trillion in assets.
NEUT7|As finally said, look, we're not going to decide whether or not this is necessarily a good or bad thing.
NEUT8|We acknowledge that clients want this, and we're going to.
NEUT9|We're going to expedite this and allow this.
NEUT10|We're going to allow them to do it through three third party funds, two of them through Galaxy.
NEUT11|Obviously, you know who's you know?
NEUT12|And these are Mike Novogratz.
NEUT13|Affirm another through another firm, and we're going to allow people to actually hold.
NEUT14|Close to a direct ownership in Bitcoin, which is a new thing you know for for the world of Wall Street for sure.
NEUT15|I assume they would only do that Hue because banks, you know sometimes have a profit motive.
NEUT16|Just throwing that out there.
NEUT17|If there was client demand.
NEUT18|You know the client demand is the motivating factor.
NEUT19|They cited that you know the sources I spoke too excited that directly, and so you know you have people clamoring for it and you know it's not like there are.
NEUT20|There aren't other ways to get exposure to Bitcoin.
NEUT21|If you you know if you if you got a few $1,000,000 you can do it directly.
NEUT22|You could do it through Coinbase.
NEUT23|You could do it through Coinbase Pro.
NEUT24|You could do it through other things and yet you know if you are a high net worth individual and you've got all your other asset assets being held.
NEUT25|You know in trust by Morgan Stanley or another firm it really is.
NEUT26|Much more clear and simple and succinct if you own it together and it's part of you know a percentage of your overall holding.
NEUT27|And by the way, you know Morgan Stanley, they're they're.
NEUT28|They're requiring people capping people at 2 1/2% so they think it's perhaps, you know, an interesting good idea to have a speculative investment in this, but they want you to do it at a maximum of 2 1/2%.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
