NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX empire."
BULL1|Amazon ended a strong rally just above the 2000 level in September 2018 and entered this range bound pattern, oscillating sideways through all of 2019 into the start of 2020.
BULL2|It broke out in February, got up a couple 100 points, and then sold off during the pandemic decline dropping to the lowest low since about March, now recovered those losses quickly, 'cause it was picked up massive market share from brick and mortar retailers returning to the high and breaking out to this very strong uptrend.
NEUT3|Now things start to get really interesting in July when we got this first pop up here right around the 3200 level.
BULL4|Now the stock pulled back to about 28129 vector and then took out that prior high.
NEUT5|Coming up this all to have a high above 3500.
NEUT6|Well this is the important part where it gives up 100% of that last rally wave.
NEUT7|Now this is a warning sign and it's also a typical pattern as part of a head and shoulders top.
BULL8|Now the stock came back up in October to this prior high and it exceeded by a little, but now it's failed that breakout.
NEUT9|And you could have two shoulders and head and shoulders pattern with uneven shoulders.
NEUT10|It's perfectly fine.
NEUT11|The stock comes back down to this point.
NEUT12|It's going to complete that pattern and possibly put in an intermediate top.
NEUT13|Now.
NEUT14|The interesting thing is that I'll be V, which is measures accumulation has an identical pattern going on.
NEUT15|Also has that neckline and we don't know which one of these two necklines is going to break first.
NEUT16|If there's a bearish outcome now.
NEUT17|On the flip side, these upper red lines are really defined about as high as you want.
NEUT18|Any sort of recovery to go right here.
NEUT19|So if Apple gets back up.
NEUT20|Excuse me, Apple, Amazon gets back up to this level and starts testing this.
BEAR21|Hyatt negates the pattern.
NEUT22|"I think we start to look for a breakout."""
