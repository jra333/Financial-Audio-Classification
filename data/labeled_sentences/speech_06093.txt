NEUT0|"""Hey folks, it's Harry swimming up in full option tiger.com."
BEAR1|This is a follow up video for SPX analysis video that I did about a week or a little more than a week ago and we were looking at this double top pattern and why this matters so so a double top pattern is a bearish pattern and what happens is if you can see from here between the double tops the market went down close to 20% and then it came up right up to that point.
NEUT2|We don't want to deal with the exact numbers but it breached it a little bit, but basically we're looking at these levels here.
BULL3|And this is a double top pattern and this is a bearish pattern and it is still developing, but we're getting more conviction to the bearish side.
NEUT4|And I'll explain that.
NEUT5|So if you see from the bottom here we have a series of higher highs and higher lows, so this is a higher height is a higher low.
NEUT6|This is a higher height.
BEAR7|This is a higher low.
NEUT8|Same way goes all the way.
NEUT9|Higher highs, higher lows all the way till here and then here it breaks down and it comes right back to the previous support.
NEUT10|Point and it's holding and then it goes back up now if.
NEUT11|This had gone and breached this, then this double top pattern would be invalidated.
NEUT12|However it has not.
BEAR13|So now this is a low high and we're heading towards a lower low if it breaches this support point then the next support point would be this and if it breaches that then there is quite a bit of room to the downside.
NEUT14|So why this is important is if you look at the all time charts on the time frame I'm going to put a custom.
NEUT15|I mean on a daily chart I'm going to go back 20 years.
NEUT16|I'm going to go back by month and so if we did that you can see for all the way from 2000 to the current day and you can also see that here in 2000 we had a wehadthe.com and then in 2008 we had the financial crisis and so you can see this was a double top pattern and it played out perfectly and then we know what happens here.
BEAR17|So the SNP goes down 60% and so I'm not saying that that's what is going to happen.
NEUT18|But this is a key crucial level, so let's go back to the daily chart.
NEUT19|And let's go back to the one year daily chart.
NEUT20|So this is a crucial level, and if it breaks this and if it breaks this one also, this is not a very big support point, so it can easily breach this.
BEAR21|So from the high now we're down 10%, so we're approaching the correction mode and a bear market is defined when it goes down 20%, and so now we'll see what happens from this level onwards.
NEUT22|And this is a key level to watch, so this is what we're watching on the SPX long term chart.
NEUT23|The first indication that there is a breakdown happening.
NEUT24|Is this price action over here?
BEAR25|"Which is which is a lower high, and now we're going to a lower low, so if that continues, then we're going to see a breakdown here, thanks."""
