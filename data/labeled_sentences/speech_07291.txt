NEUT0|"""Let's let's talk Disney earnings right now and what you're expecting, and most importantly, what you're looking for."
NEUT1|Look, I think what the two main things investors are going to focus on right?
BEAR2|Because obviously the parks are closed.
BEAR3|There's still a lot of challenges facing that business.
NEUT4|Movie industry is still basically shut down around the world, So what investors are looking for two things?
NEUT5|Andrew one.
NEUT6|What's that Disney subscriber but Disney Plus subscriber number?
NEUT7|Obviously you mentioned it was 86 million.
BULL8|I think that numbers got to be above ninety million for investors to be excited.
BEAR9|I think there's a little bit of fear that the US number could be declining slightly, so I think everyone's going to be looking for what's the progress in Disney plus.
NEUT10|Obviously they gave out some very big subscriber targets for Disney plus over the next couple of years, but I think the real thing is going to be the leaning in they want.
NEUT11|Shapwick investors want shape to keep leaning in harder and harder to streaming.
NEUT12|Obviously you've seen what Warner Brothers is done taking all of their movies directly to HBO Max.
NEUT13|I think with things like Black Widow coming up and theaters just not going to be open to real capacity around the country, let alone around the world.
NEUT14|I think investors want to hear from Disney that they're taking movies like Black Widow and going directly to Disney.
NEUT15|Plus, I think those are the types of things.
BULL16|That can keep the kind of momentum in Disney stock going.
NEUT17|And so, but how do you thread that needle in terms of explaining that to the investor?
NEUT18|And how much do you think that that is a phenomena of the pandemic, 'cause we've talked about this, you know, once the toothpaste is out of the tube, can you ever put it back?
NEUT19|We were actually talking about that related to the whole clubhouse and Twitter spaces phenomenon last night, actually, right?
NEUT20|But I mean from the standpoint of the movie business, I mean, look, I think you're never going to put the toothpaste completely back in.
NEUT21|I don't think Windows, you know the historic windows between when a movie came out in movie theaters and wanna consumer could watch it in some capacity in their home.
NEUT22|Pre pandemic was essentially 75 days.
NEUT23|Yes, there were exceptions.
NEUT24|What Netflix was doing and what Amazon was doing.
NEUT25|I don't think when we come out of the pandemic you know.
NEUT26|So think about 2022 and beyond.
NEUT27|My guess is movie Windows are going to be somewhere between 17 and 30 days.
NEUT28|I mean, obviously universals already come out and said we want to get movies to P VAD, which is sort of, you know, call it 20 or $30 premium pricing for video on demand.
NEUT29|You know after movies, theatrical release, whether it's espod or prevod.
NEUT30|I don't believe movie Windows will ever be the same.
NEUT31|It's why we're so sceptical of the movie theater business.
NEUT32|It's AMC is never going to look the same on the other side of this pandemic.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
