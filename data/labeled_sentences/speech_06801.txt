NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol TSLA Tesla."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, a very very solid day on this one.
NEUT4|Got the break out through that red line which I talked about in the video from Tuesday.
BEAR5|An really just never look back continue to grind higher and higher.
NEUT6|So certainly updates need to be made.
NEUT7|Going to go ahead and just delete that line out.
NEUT8|Sure, that level still pertains, just not really relevant right now from a presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing confusion and clutter colors.
NEUT9|Lines are very long, so let's try to keep this as clean as possible, but the first update that does need to be made come about based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed above you want to see them act as support, so when the newest areas of support is now that 643 mark.
BULL10|But a much nearer term level of support in what I would call the ideal level motorcycle.
NEUT11|You know what?
NEUT12|Make this chart look the absolute best?
NEUT13|Going forward.
NEUT14|That would now be if the price can say above 250 or excuse me 655 now.
BEAR15|Don't get me wrong, the price falls below 655.
NEUT16|That doesn't mean the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price.
NEUT17|Could stay, you know, manage table that level.
BULL18|That would definitely be a very very impressive sign of power.
NEUT19|But again, if the price drops will it not be in the world?
NEUT20|'cause then you still do have that 642 mark down there now?
NEUT21|As far as areas of resistance of concern, I'm going to squeeze on the charter and just get this red line and play.
NEUT22|'cause I'm very curious.
NEUT23|About this red line right here, and to see if it's going to come into play once again and potentially act as resistance, and that's that area right there.
NEUT24|If you go through the history of things, you can see this red line has quite the track record of forecasting where the sellers would be.
NEUT25|So if the price can get up to that area as of now right around 690, but that is it red line, so it's going to be changing over time.
NEUT26|But point here being that, that's definitely a very very interesting trend line.
NEUT27|From an overall standpoint, so I'm curious to see if the price gets up to that area.
NEUT28|Can it break up above it?
NEUT29|But even if it just gets rejected from where the price is now?
NEUT30|If it makes its way all the way up there.
BULL31|I mean, that's a good.
NEUT32|Basically another $20 more give or take.
NEUT33|So I mean, there's still some potential here it seems.
NEUT34|If this upward movement continues, but overall that's going to the main resistance level that I'll be watching.
NEUT35|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT36|Moving forward.
NEUT37|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT38|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT39|But it will be me.
NEUT40|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL41|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT42|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT43|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR44|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT47|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT48|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT49|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT50|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT51|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT52|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
