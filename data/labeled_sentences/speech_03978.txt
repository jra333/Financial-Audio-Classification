NEUT0|"""Just a quick update."
BEAR1|I was going to keep my cash over the weekend, but due to volatility on tech just right now I went back 240%.
NEUT2|Leverage, I bought Shopify at 1:10.
BEAR3|This is almost a six month low.
NEUT4|Let's look at the charts.
NEUT5|Six months.
BEAR6|Almost at 6 month low and it's down 10% year date.
BULL7|So plenty of upside here it came all the way back down from after the break up from 1500, so I don't want to miss this opportunity so I'm not waiting on, but today it's very up now.
NEUT8|Look at the one month.
NEUT9|And my short term price target is 1100.
NEUT10|But here it has to.
BULL11|I want to see a breakout resistance.
NEUT12|And I also bought Netflix at 498.
NEUT13|But my entry price under 500, an air BNB at 169 is not quite.
NEUT14|At 165, but I want it so.
NEUT15|I bought it.
NEUT16|"I'll post my updated portfolio tomorrow."""
