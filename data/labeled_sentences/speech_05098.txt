NEUT0|"""Hey traders control the trade here."
NEUT1|Taking a look at Netflix, Netflix is going to announce earnings this Tuesday, January the 19th after the close, so thought this would be a perfect wanted chart.
BULL2|Good timing and Netflix has extreme volatility, particularly during earnings.
NEUT3|You can look back and see a lot of examples of that.
NEUT4|Right now we have the daily chart up.
NEUT5|I could not see retracements here.
NEUT6|Starting at the all time high and you can see we've never.
BULL7|Actually really, truly challenged that.
BULL8|Yet we've had a couple of attempts here.
NEUT9|To do so and right now just looks to me like it's kind of a slow grinding pattern.
NEUT10|Looks kind of bearish when you really think about it in the context of the rest of the market in tech.
NEUT11|You would expect Netflix to have gone up a lot more during this huge run up, so you could look at that two ways.
NEUT12|You could say that and say that's a bearish divergance.
NEUT13|Or you could also say it's consolidating in this bull flag long term pattern.
NEUT14|But if you really look at the look at the short term chart here 50.
NEUT15|Moving average really hasn't meant much.
NEUT16|It's kind of just been slicing and dicing through it, but it's also been hovering underneath of the 20.
BULL17|Moving average lately.
NEUT18|Just around here.
NEUT19|And we're curving down.
NEUT20|So it's looking in the short term is looking kind of bearish tamelier 200.
NEUT21|Moving average sloping upward.
BEAR22|There's definitely of course some gaps back here for them.
NEUT23|For the most part, most gaps do get filled.
BEAR24|Netflix tends to run hot and cold, and when it gets cold it tends to flush down very fast, panics everybody and the story.
NEUT25|The narrative that the news provides suddenly changes with amazing how quickly the narrative changes based on the chart, not based on Netflix themselves.
NEUT26|Maybe some silly analyst comes out with some BS report or downgrade on Netflix when it's really the same company that's had excellent growth and I don't look at the fundamentals, but I do know that most of the analysts are dead wrong on this stock and many others.
NEUT27|Usually the contrarian play.
NEUT28|It's usually a good sign or signal to go the opposite.
NEUT29|Let's look at a different time frame.
BULL30|There's a weekly time frame and you can see we're getting pretty close here to the 50.
NEUT31|50 week.
NEUT32|Moving average to redline here.
NEUT33|50 week moving average made the 20 week right here.
NEUT34|Which is at 503.
BEAR35|There's a psychological number here 500 that staying below is definitely more bearish than staying above.
NEUT36|Plus you also have this moving average here.
NEUT37|I mean, this looks like a reversal candle right here.
NEUT38|Let's see the low here.
NEUT39|For 9:50 the close was 5-10.
BEAR40|Very close to being a reversal can you could really call this the beginning of this downtrend here.
NEUT41|So going back to the daily chart.
NEUT42|I would watch the 200.
NEUT43|Moving average here.
NEUT44|4796, however, when earnings are announced, most of the time you'll see a huge huge spike in both directions.
NEUT45|There's no reason to gamble on this.
NEUT46|It's better to just wait.
NEUT47|And see how the earnings play out and see how the market.
NEUT48|Digest the earnings and then make a play on it.
NEUT49|"Otherwise, you're just flipping a coin."""
