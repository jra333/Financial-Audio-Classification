NEUT5|Help your boy out.
NEUT6|OK, so today we talk about FedEx.
BULL7|I think FedEx presents a good opportunity.
BEAR8|It did have good earnings, but the earnings are slowed down and they didn't provide a guidance for the next quarter, which doesn't look so good for FedEx.
BULL9|But I do think this drop right here provided a good opportunity to try to get a discounted call option so some levels I'm looking at for FedEx or the first support level that I wanted to see was 281.
NEUT10|Around 281 like around here.
NEUT11|But it broke that, so my next support level.
NEUT12|But I do think it is going to is 274.5.
BULL13|So that's right around here at this level right here I want to see support.
NEUT14|I think we might see a price of bounce at 274 and if we do see a price bounce at 274 and then it goes over, sold and cross it back to 40 I will get in on a call option.
NEUT15|And depending on.
BULL16|The oversold opportunity I will get in on that 274.
NEUT17|And my exit price would be around 280.
NEUT18|My exercise will be around 280, so I'll enter here and I exit here for a quick scout play.
NEUT19|Looking forward to next week, but if it breaks the 274 support level.
NEUT20|Then I'll be looking for price to go lower.
BEAR21|I'll be more bearish on the stock right now.
NEUT22|I am bullish.
NEUT23|But if it breaks at 274 support level, the last support level that I'll be looking forward to is 269.
NEUT24|And if it breaks at 269 then I will turn bearish and then I'll start looking for some put plays on FedEx.
NEUT25|So to recap, first support level.
NEUT26|It is 274 fifty.
NEUT27|Two, 7450 is the first support level.
NEUT28|If it breaks that the second support level is 269.
NEUT29|And then if it breaks that Ultimi bull bearish.
NEUT30|But if it holds support at any of these two levels, I will get in on a call to quick scalp it and then my exit will be around 280.
NEUT31|Unless my profit is good enough, I'll just exit before 280, but that will be my exit profit.
NEUT32|OK and also UPS has earnings in January.
NEUT33|And I think UPS will do the same as FedEx did, so I'll make another video on UPS as it gets closer.
BULL34|'cause I think we can get a good play on UPS with either selling calls or some put options.
NEUT35|But I'll let you guys know about that when it gets a little closer.
BULL36|Hope you guys like this video.

NEUT39|Oh, and also I think I'm thinking about making a Patreon to post more in-depth plays.
NEUT40|An actual place that I will be doing to give you guys a heads up on some stuff.
NEUT41|"Let me know if you guys like that and I'll see you guys in the next one, but."""
