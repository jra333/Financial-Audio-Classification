NEUT0|"""Alright, here's my short sell for NCT."
BEAR1|There's the downtrend.
NEUT2|And there's my entry point and my stop loss.
NEUT3|Right away it goes down, so I'm good with my stop loss with it.
NEUT4|Bounces around a little bit and then descends further.
BULL5|Got some good profits going and boom, a gap up.
BEAR6|This ****** me off and actually sold at a higher price than my stop loss, which is frustrating.
NEUT7|When you're holding overnight, you always knows a chance of this happening.
NEUT8|But when it does actually happen, it's a tough rectal Suppository to swallow.
BEAR9|Alright, so I took a small loss.
NEUT10|Let's go back and look at the gap.
BEAR11|Even using stop losses you can get hurt holding overnight because.
NEUT12|There's a chance can gap up like it did this time.
NEUT13|You have everything under control.
NEUT14|Everything is within your parameters and then the market takes your power away from you.
NEUT15|Reminds me of being an elementary school coloring.
NEUT16|Everything's going perfectly in between the lines.
NEUT17|It's like a masterpiece.
NEUT18|And your friend comes and shakes your desk.
NEUT19|Then that sensation that rises up in you and makes you clench your fist happens.
BEAR20|"It's more than just anger."""
