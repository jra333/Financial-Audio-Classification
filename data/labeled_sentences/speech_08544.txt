NEUT0|"""It's clean this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, quite eventful day in this one.
NEUT5|In the downward direction and I should note that from disclosure standpoint, I do own Apple from the long side and my retirement accounts.
NEUT6|So yes, my retirement accounts weren't too happy to see this action today, but I mean you figured reality had to show up at least at some point.
NEUT7|And you know, with as crazy as this things Ben, I don't think anybody's early too shocked to see this thing pulled back a little bit here.
NEUT8|But that now brings about some very interesting dynamics or headed into Friday.
NEUT9|So the first dynamic that everybody and their brother's uncle is going to be watching is this level of support right here at basically $120.50.
NEUT10|Generally speaking, that is where the price bounce off it from right there and then the price rolled back over and once again stop going down right at that level.
NEUT11|So is this a guarantee of anything?
NEUT12|Absolutely not no such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT13|Is it a valid?
NEUT14|Is it a rational thought to have?
NEUT15|Yeah, for sure that if the price.
NEUT16|Comes out of that area and breaks down below it.
BEAR17|That could very well create some additional downside selling pressure, you know.
NEUT18|Just because like I said, call that a cellphone prophecy.
NEUT19|Carter if you want.
BEAR20|Just because that level is been broken, that could cause more people to want to lock in some profits, which thereby makes even more selling.
NEUT21|And the other reason why that's interesting is if that level word you know fail.
NEUT22|Next key level.
NEUT23|Essentially not until done around that gap closed location which is around 1:18 fifty not saying it's for sure.
NEUT24|Going down to 118 fifty, but technically speaking I don't think that would really shock anybody if that actually played out in that manner.
NEUT25|As far as areas of resistance are concerned, so who knows?
BULL26|Maybe that level of support down there at 1:20 fifty is going to continue to hold US support.
NEUT27|'cause to be fair, I mean it's held twice so far ready, but in the event there's any sort of attempted bounce to the upside first key level resistance going to be right up there at 124 and the next key overarching level of resistance right up there at that former area of support.
NEUT28|Which sets right here.
NEUT29|Let's see what was that?
NEUT30|The one 2775 marks.
NEUT31|Overall though, shaky day today, but we'll see how this one closes out the week on Friday.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird.
NEUT37|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT38|But in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT45|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT46|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
