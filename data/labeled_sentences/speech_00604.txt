NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Jerrod Blicker E. For the breakdown of today's market action."
NEUT1|He joined by special guest Jerrod.
NEUT2|Yes, that is right.
NEUT3|We got JC Parets here from All Star charts and I want to bring you in JC.
NEUT4|Let's start with the market.
NEUT5|Overall, you know I monitor your Twitter feed and I gotta say, why are you so bearish?
NEUT6|Oh wait, wait, it's the opposite.
NEUT7|Why are you so bullish here?
BEAR8|Well, when stocks are making new all time highs, that's probably not evidence that they're in a downtrend right?
NEUT9|And you know, the truth is people are afraid of their own shadows.
BEAR10|I don't know what everyone so angry about.
BEAR11|You know the stock market making all time highs last week the volatility index was pushing 40 with the S&P 503 1/2% off all time highs.
NEUT12|We've never seen that before.
NEUT13|So basically the fact of the matter is people are more scared for the least amount of reasons in stock market history.
NEUT14|I can't think of a more bullish combination.
BEAR15|Angry people and stocks in Uptrends, I mean.
NEUT16|Yeah, and you're lucky you're looking at the commodities market too.
NEUT17|I mean, we got crude oil at a one year high.
NEUT18|I don't think a lot of people thought we'd be holding above $50 here.
NEUT19|Let me just get to that crude oil chart.
NEUT20|What are you seeing in the market right now?
NEUT21|I think people forgot about commodities.
NEUT22|You know, in the old days when you and I first got in this business, commodities were booming.
NEUT23|Are you kidding?
NEUT24|Me?
NEUT25|Oil went to 150, natural gas was ripping.
NEUT26|You know, these Peabody Energy and all these energy and global growth names were monsters emerging markets used to outperform like.
BEAR27|It was a whole different world and then ten years ago everything changed and it's been a disaster ever since.
NEUT28|So these millennials have never seen an environment that commodities are doing great.
NEUT29|They don't know anything about that stuff.
NEUT30|I think they're starting to discover it and us old timers, right?
NEUT31|It's funny to even say that, but the ones that have been through multiple cycles like we have, we remember the good old days.
NEUT32|We know that when commodities go, they go.
NEUT33|So I think the commodity supercycle, this one has gotten started.
BEAR34|I think crude oil trading below zero was what sparked this.
NEUT35|Originally, I mean I can't think of a better beginning of a commodity supersite gold and crude oil trading below 0, right?
NEUT36|Yeah, you gotta think that was the market clearing event of 2020, but I know you're also watching financials.
BULL37|We had X LF breaking to new highs recently.
NEUT38|What are you seeing in the in the in the financial space here?
NEUT39|I mean, you could argue this is the most important stock market sector index in the world.
BEAR40|I mean we don't have bull markets without financials, financials are still stuck below their 2007 hives or pretty much right there in the way.
NEUT41|I learned that the more times the level is tested, the higher the likelihood that it breaks.
BEAR42|And if financials are breaking out a 14 year basis, it makes it very difficult for me to be bearish.
NEUT43|Makes you want to buy the XL left.
NEUT44|Look at Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT45|It's actually the biggest component in XLF represents about 15% of the sector.
NEUT46|If we're above 235 in Berkshire.
NEUT47|You gotta be buying with Warren Buffett.
NEUT48|Uncle Warren is going to make us some money.
NEUT49|I hear that he got a big cash pile to JC.
NEUT50|"Thank you for joining us here and I'm going to toss it back to Zach."""
