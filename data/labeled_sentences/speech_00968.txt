NEUT1|I grew up on this.
NEUT2|I and my first question to ask Dylan 'cause you have been the CEO is why not go public it in IPO 'cause people want this company.
NEUT3|It's a great question we met up with the Collier Creek guys about a year ago.
BULL4|Roger Deromedi as you said, has a great track record as a CPG wizard and we just thought at the end of the day it was a great way for us to start the next century of growth with a with a great team from the call your team to add to our board to work on governance to work on our strategy going forward.
BULL5|So we're really excited about it.
NEUT6|Roger does sound like that.

NEUT8|I've got your wares in front of us, a platform not unlike.
BULL9|Pinnacle Foods, which turned out to be a fantastic platform that made a fortune for investors.
NEUT10|You're exactly right, yeah, and then this is what we intend to do with us, and we sometimes refer to it as Pinnacle 2.0.
BULL11|We want to apply our operating playbook that we used at Pinnacle and the team there so successfully broke shareholder value.
BULL12|And as you commented between CEOs, I, Bob, Gamgort and help and previously then Mark Klaus, the team drove 24% annual stock appreciation from when we went public with the IPO in March of 2013.
NEUT13|So when we sold the ConAgra in October of 2018, our intention is to do exactly the same thing.
NEUT14|Take this platform afire playbook and what's even more exciting is the category were competing in is a great category.
