NEUT0|"""We think diversification as practice generally makes very little sense for anyone that knows what they're doing."
NEUT1|Diversification is a protection against ignorance.
NEUT2|I mean, if you want to make sure that nothing bad happens to you relative to the market, you own everything.
NEUT3|There's nothing wrong with that.
NEUT4|I mean that as a perfectly sound approach for somebody who who does not feel they know how to analyze businesses.
NEUT5|If you know how to analyze businesses and value businesses, it's crazy to own 50 stocks or 40 stocks, or 30 stocks.
NEUT6|Probably because there aren't that many wonderful businesses.
NEUT7|That are understandable to a single human being.
NEUT8|In all likelihood, Anet and to have some super wonderful business and then putting money in #30 or 35 on your list of attractiveness and forgo putting more money into #1 just strikes Charlie and me as as madness and it's conventional practice, and it it may.
NEUT9|You know, if all you have to achieve is average.
NEUT10|It's may preserve your job, but it's a confession in our view that you don't really understand the businesses that you own.
NEUT11|You know, do I need on 28 stocks in order to have proper diversification yonan?
NEUT12|B nonsense and within Berkshire I could pick out three of our businesses and I would.
NEUT13|I would be very happy if they were the only businesses we own, and I had all my money in Berkshire.
NEUT14|Now I love it.
NEUT15|The fact that we can find more than that and that we keep adding to it.
NEUT16|But three wonderful businesses is more than more than you need in this life to do very well.
NEUT17|And the average person isn't going to run into that.
NEUT18|I mean, if you look at how fortunes were building this country, they weren't built out of a portfolio 50 companies.
NEUT19|They were.
NEUT20|They were built by someone who who identified with us with a wonderful business.
BULL21|Coca Cola is a great example.
NEUT22|A lot of fortunes have been built on that and there aren't 50 Coca Cola's.
NEUT23|You know there aren't 20 if there were defined, we could all go out and.
BULL24|Diversify like crazy among that group and and get results that would be equal to owning the really wonderful one, but.
NEUT25|You're not going to find it, and.
NEUT26|And the truth is, you don't need it.
NEUT27|I mean, if you have a really wonderful business.
NEUT28|Is very well protected against against the vicissitudes of the economy over time and and competition.
BULL29|I mean, you know we're talking about businesses that are resistant to effective competition, and three of those will be better than 100 average businesses at, and they'll be safer.
NEUT30|Incidentally, I mean they there is less risk in owning 3 easy to identify wonderful businesses there.
NEUT31|Then there is an owning 50 well known big businesses.
NEUT32|And.
NEUT33|It's amazing what has been taught over the years in finance classes about that, but I can assure you that if I had to bet.
NEUT34|The next 30 years on the fortunes of my family that would be dependent upon the income from a given group of businesses.
NEUT35|"I would rather pick three businesses from those wheel and then own a diversified group of 51."""
