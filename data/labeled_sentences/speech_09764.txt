BULL0|"""Welcome back everyone."
NEUT1|So this is going to be a snapshot recording for four fastly.
NEUT2|The four hour time chart is what we have in front of us and what I really want to focus is on this swing high and swing low.
NEUT3|Basically, from these points, if we fib.
NEUT4|Them and.
NEUT5|Mark them as X and a.
NEUT6|Then potentially we have a 78.6.
NEUT7|78.6 butterfly harmonic pattern.
NEUT8|OK. We are currently at the sea point.
NEUT9|So the and we can see that this was roughly around the 88.6 level threshold.
NEUT10|If you're not familiar with harmonic patterns, and I would highly encourage you to watch.
NEUT11|The harmonic pattern recording that I made as part of the tutorials.
NEUT12|So the next question.
NEUT13|The next pertinent question would really be that is this going to crash?
NEUT14|And negate the harmonic.
NEUT15|Or will this hold so?
NEUT16|The qualifying criteria, as I suppose, would be to look out for reversal patterns here and the first one would be to really look out for any continuation patterns on a smaller time chart an.
NEUT17|I suppose this could be classed as a 123 because Rice made a low and a higher low and the stochastics rolled all the way back, so this could be a hidden divergences on a microscopic scale.
BULL18|So potentially this could work and this could be the starting point of price climbing back up.
NEUT19|So that is on the hour time chart.
NEUT20|Again, I think the third link in the description below discuss is all divergences.
NEUT21|It's interesting because a 30 minute time chart also has.
NEUT22|Regular bullish divergance here as well, so we have D1D2 and D3 and if you compare the price give us a low lower low.
BEAR23|Stochastics gave us a low higher low.
NEUT24|We can see that here.
NEUT25|OK, so that means that our D4 would be somewhere here.
NEUT26|Possibly OK, so we could do something like this where we had our XA B. BCD possibly or this could pull back a bit lower so there's a couple of sort of microscopic confirming technical patterns that are around this area here around these C point for the Harmonic Pattern, watch the harmonic pattern link in the description below, just to familiarize yourself and then for divergences, watch the third link, but potentially there is a harmonic pattern on the weekly or the four hour, yet 2 hours.
NEUT27|So this would be an interesting pattern to watch out for.
NEUT28|OK.
NEUT29|Thanks for watching guys.
NEUT30|Please do all of the nice things like liking, subscribing and sharing this as much as possible to help out the channel and if I missed any detail out then please let me know.
NEUT31|My focus is purely on technical patterns so I don't look at fundamentals are purely look at technical patterns and the emergence of price action and see what sort of picture.
NEUT32|That develops on the candle sticks and the.
BULL33|And the time charts OK, thanks for watching.
NEUT34|"Look after yourselves please and I shall see you all in the next recording."""
