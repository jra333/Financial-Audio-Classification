NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Santa Fe is range between $4 flat and $46.43."
NEUT1|No.
NEUT2|How did I get those values?
NEUT3|Paying $4 flat represents the company's cash, so for every share issued and outstanding they have $4 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Paying $46.43 per share represents the company's price per share, based on its earnings, a price of $46.43 per share represents the fractional payment for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT5|A conservative way to value the company using future earnings, which is slightly different from the results, would get if you calculated its price to earnings ratio.
NEUT6|So what are they trading at now?
NEUT7|Well, they're trading at $47.68, which is really close to this high in value.
NEUT8|Still a bit over.
NEUT9|We would definitely want to watch this one to see if it decreases or drops at or below this price because then that would allow us to reasonably engage in further fundamental analysis.
NEUT10|Until then, the reasonable thing to do would be to find an investment vehicle which will gain a similar return with similar risk, all while maintaining one safety principle and two.
BULL11|An ample margin of safety.
NEUT12|If you are a defensive value investor like myself, a low cost index fund satisfies the Afor mentioned investment vehicle characteristics.
NEUT13|Specifically the Vanguard 500 Index fund will will do the job for you.
NEUT14|Now.
NEUT15|I have no financial relationship with these folks.
NEUT16|They don't pay me to say this on my channel, but the only reason I use him is because Warren Buffett used them in 2008 when he started and won a bet against the hedge fund industry.
NEUT17|So he wanted in 2018 officially and the bet was well.
NEUT18|I bet I can get a higher return then you can an he did it by doing really nothing.
NEUT19|He just bought and left it alone and he beat out these professionals in New York.
NEUT20|So I figure if the professionals can't beat out the index fund who am I to to say I could?
NEUT21|Well This is why we do this analysis 'cause we would we would be defensive and put our money here as opposed to here with Santa Fe.
NEUT22|And really we would.
NEUT23|We would want to wait so we would invest in the index fund until this price drops.
NEUT24|This price the high end of our intrinsic value calculation because then, once it does drop beneath this price then that would allow us to engage in further fundamental analysis.
NEUT25|We look at some cash accounts, their cash flow statements, things are those of that nature.
