NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, analytics Sage regarding the world, Walt Disney and what happened first?"
NEUT1|We had the wave one wave two and we are unfolding Wave 3 the way three is shorter than what it should be.
NEUT2|But the issue I have is that this structure, to be honest 100% makes sense to be complete having a 12345.
BEAR3|But the problem is that the earlier trend channel is not broken so I cannot confirm we are underway for OK.
NEUT4|I want to see this trend channel to get broken.
NEUT5|Yeah.
NEUT6|Because usually breaking this channel is an initial sign for entering the way for.
BULL7|I have not seen that we saw a perfect resistant here, so there is a chance the market will unfold more.
NEUT8|But currently because this wave count is making sense, I cannot say that we have another wave to unfold and come off the trade setup so couple of things might happen.
NEUT9|The market might go up OK. And then it can come all the way to this box.
NEUT10|Keep in mind that the wave two is shallow.
NEUT11|OK, so you can expect even a deeper way for correction.
BULL12|OK, the market has a bounce back.
NEUT13|You might come up here up to this level even.
BEAR14|And then the market will break and go down.
NEUT15|So if you want to buy Walt Disney.
NEUT16|I don't see any evidence that convince me it's a time to buy.
NEUT17|The only thing is touching the train channel from the RSI point of view.
NEUT18|Also, this is not daughter swipe pattern.
NEUT19|I like to see for the way for still has more space to calm down so.
NEUT20|I think the best thing to do is to wait more and wait for the Waif.
NEUT21|Or if this is going to be the way for this is my assumption, maybe I'm wrong, But if this is a way for this cannot be the way for this pattern.
NEUT22|We still have a longer way to unfold the way for completely.
BULL23|"Thanks for watching and have a good night."""
