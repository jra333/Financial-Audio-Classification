NEUT0|"""Alright, this is the Robin Hood strategy free trade video."
NEUT1|Joe and I were looking at ideas to try to market and get this out here so one of the ways we came up with is just.
NEUT2|Showing you a trade.
NEUT3|On video, so here we go.
BULL4|This, hopefully this is helpful.
NEUT5|So who are we first of all?
NEUT6|Robin Hood strategy is made up of myself and Joe Dime and we both were investing for some time so we thought, hey, let's make a portfolio of $100,000 tracker performance and you know people can subscribe if they'd like.
BULL7|So we started with $100,000 this year and we're up nearly 22% to 120 one 1842.
NEUT8|So one of the trades we did this week is Altria.
BEAR9|We spoke at the Milwaukee Investing Club and we pitched it to him and they ended up buying so all three as you can see, they've gotten rocked lately, down 78, from $78 a share down to about 6371.
NEUT10|So what happened?
NEUT11|FDA came out and said they're going to limit the amount of nicotine in cigarettes.
BULL12|Well, Ultra is the number one cigarette maker in the United States.
BEAR13|So obviously their stock got hit.
BEAR14|But we think it's an overreaction.
NEUT15|Ultra is highly profitable.
BULL16|They've got improving gross margins.
NEUT17|$0.61 out of every dollar that they collect, they can devote towards operating expenses.
NEUT18|That's pretty huge.
NEUT19|They've got a return on invested capital of 70.
NEUT20|We look for about 10% and they also have a free cash flow of sales percent of.
BULL21|23 and we also look for 10% in that as well, so it's a highly profitable company.
NEUT22|Now, let's say you're just getting into investing.
NEUT23|And you know, for years you been dragging your feet and you're saying, man, you know I want to start investing, but I don't want to put money in the market and lose it.
NEUT24|I hear that from a million people.
NEUT25|Well guys, you you just have to do it because you don't learn how to play basketball unless you play basketball, you don't learn how to do something and you don't learn how to do your job unless you do your job.
NEUT26|That's how investing goes to.
NEUT27|I didn't learn how to invest until I actually put money in the market and then I was a little more passionate about it.
BULL28|So all tree is a good beginning.
BEAR29|Stock it's trading down at a PE of eight and it said a long term support level so.
NEUT30|If you're looking to buy a first stock, this one would be compareable too.
NEUT31|PepsiCo, Coca Cola Procter and gamble.
NEUT32|It's just an American name that unless everybody on this earth that smoked died.
NEUT33|This one is going to continue to be profitable for years, so it's a no brainer.
NEUT34|You're going to get about 4% in return in dividends alone, so.
BULL35|Thanks for watching guys, hope this video was somewhat helpful and we're probably going to make some more videos in the future so.
