NEUT0|"""Finally, you know what I don't come empty handed to any party."
NEUT1|I've got two new themes brought to you by the Biden White House.
NEUT2|First, be ready for more stringent environmental regulations that push people into electronic vehicles.
NEUT3|Now we've seen this all over the place.
NEUT4|This is not new to you, but I'm going to bring you constantly, not just Tesla plug power.
NEUT5|Someone put a big short rate on that one today for green hydrogen electrical vehicle players that are emerging with special purpose acquisition vehicles.
NEUT6|Northern Genesis soon be lying electric.
NEUT7|Don't forget Lordstown Motors CIGS, which is merging with UK based arrival.
NEUT8|Everyone is very hot on that one.
NEUT9|But you don't want.
BULL10|I'm increasingly drawn to forward because they're electrifying the F-150, and they've got a nice investment in Rivian.
NEUT11|The $25 billion electric truck developer.
BULL12|It was the second biggest gainer in the S&P 500 today.
NEUT13|General Motors works too.
BULL14|They both are cheap and they've got momentum.
NEUT15|Second is housing I've been reluctant to do this.
NEUT16|I would like to recommend Toll Brothers KB Homes, Pulte Dr Horton, Lennar, 'cause I was worried about higher interest rates.
BULL17|But after what we've heard from Fed Chief Jerome Powell and then incoming Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, I believe Rachel's gonna stay up for a long time, maybe years so.
NEUT18|Think about it.
BEAR19|Meanwhile Biden's problem Igration, which is gigantic for home builders.
BULL20|There are at least ten million undocumented undocumented immigrants who will soon be able to come out of the shadows an ask for credit to buy a home, and that will be amazing for the home builders, especially since we only have 2.3 a month worth of homes for sale right now.
BEAR21|And that is among the lowest on record.
BULL22|Now we get an extra aggressive infrastructure push.
NEUT23|You should buy Caterpillar if Biden goes big on solar energy of puns and names a SunPower.
NEUT24|But unlike the others, I think the jury is still out on those themes.
NEUT25|They don't do enough work.
NEUT26|What's the point of identifying these big themes?
NEUT27|Simple, they give you something to fall back on.
NEUT28|You don't chase these stocks in the way up people.
NEUT29|You wait for a pullback, then you pile them on the way down when everyone else is scared to death.
NEUT30|The whole point is that you can feel confident buying them in weakness because the themes give you staying power and you've done the homework.
NEUT31|The bottom line, most of these teams don't need a new president or president or any president.
NEUT32|You put a dog in the Oval Office and they'll still work.
NEUT33|The only thing these companies need is capital and this document will provide this stock market will provide any capital that is needed in a heartbeat.
