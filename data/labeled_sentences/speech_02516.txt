NEUT1|If you don't know we have a really big problem with plastic because plastic pollute oceans and if it wouldn't do anything with this problem it will be our children.
NEUT2|Problem.
NEUT3|What I really like in this company that they founded in.
NEUT4|2004 and they already have a lots of partnership with Procter and Gamble, PepsiCo, and Nestle, and other big names.
NEUT5|800 billion LBZ plastic produced an early and then mirror can actually waste the 500 billion LDS and I think it is huge and they have two technology.
NEUT6|It is a pH a made from canola.
NEUT7|And plastic if you can call it plastic made by pH.
NEUT8|A technology can degrade it without any other help like heat or some specific bacteria.
NEUT9|I think it is awesome mushrooms outside their fully degraded about in 12 to 18 weeks after that product is discarded and actually they grow canola then take oil from it and can make.
NEUT10|All lots of things expected.
NEUT11|$400 million in AD revenue and I think it is huge for just plastic production.
NEUT12|Big companies target to go a little bit green and not produce unreal amount of garbage.
BULL13|And I think it is good.
NEUT14|Plus in some countries government already banned plastic packages and maybe with some.
NEUT15|Locker government will look for sit to use assistive technology or some kind of this technology Nestle, and then in our scientific team up to developer build degradable or water bottle and I suggest you to watch video in the first step in that comment and.

BEAR17|Some competitors are filled for bankruptcy and it is not really good.
NEUT18|Kentucky facility forecast 96% Kegger, Greenfield facility, 62% gigger.
NEUT19|It is super interesting when they publish merger information and it was.
NEUT20|$890 million a company.
NEUT21|I think it is super low expectation are really nice.
NEUT22|$169 million in 2025 and with Presta earning around 20 it can be super easy.
NEUT23|$3 billion stock.
NEUT24|I'm not suggesting you to participate in this talk right now because guys who bought it for $10.
BEAR25|Will cower as their positions and I'm expecting a drawdown.
NEUT26|Maybe $215 or something like this because it is spark and they do it in 80% of first situations.
NEUT27|If the stock will draw down to $15 I will try to buy it because profitable green company.
NEUT28|It is always nice and it is easy.
