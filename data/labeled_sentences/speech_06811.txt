NEUT0|"""OK guys, So what we're looking at is ticker, symbol, AIG, American International Group."
NEUT1|Now I just want to stop on this chart real quick because what I was looking at here was this right here.

NEUT3|Has been trading sideways and as I can see in this spot right here it looks like a ascending triangle just from the way it looks.
NEUT4|So let's go ahead and jump into the chart here.
BEAR5|So down here in March 19th we had to drop.
BEAR6|It's been bouncing back and forth.
NEUT7|It looks like it's been in.
NEUT8|In pretty tight quarters, bouncing back and forth and finally it looks like it's trying to break out of this area, so I just want to give you guys a heads up for you.
NEUT9|Swing traders Annu Day traders if you guys were looking for this break out now when you drop down to a few hours you can see the breakouts here but you have plenty of time to write that up, especially with it having so much push up so much strength.
NEUT10|Here's the volume and the strength is.
BULL11|Very strong.
NEUT12|So there might be ways to go when you move out to the week you see that it just happened, so we'll see what happens.
