BEAR0|"""I thought that it was positive relative to expectation, but the move in the aftermarket mask the underlying cautious trend that we've seen in the business here."
NEUT1|I think your recap has largely covered this, but I just want to emphasize this piece.
BEAR2|Is that ultimately for this to work, they need to have margin expansion an continue to grow Subs, and we're entering a multi quarter of really uncertain TI.
NEUT3|Also when we think about their guidance in relative to the uncertainty in some of the comments, they've had to help investors frame in December.
BULL4|It's important context that historically this has been a company that is given guidance and exceeded the sub guidance in the June quarter.
NEUT5|They missed by 47% and then they took this.
BEAR6|More conservative view on September and they missed that by 3%.
BEAR7|So this concept that this now 20% decline in their guidance for December is a safe number, I think that that is unknown at this point, and I think now you hit it right on the head too.
NEUT8|It's just not about the December quarter, but ultimately what happens in March.
BULL9|And so I think that this was positive to expectations.
NEUT10|"But this is still a story that I think would be difficult to own."""
