BEAR0|"""Sterling is not had the best start to the week on Monday, the pound suffered its biggest fallen over six years after London Mayor Boris Johnson threw his weight behind the Leave campaign ahead of the upcoming referendum with me to discuss the pounds fall is the FT's currencies correspondent, Roger Blitz, now Roger, a weaker pound."
BULL1|Surely that's good for the UK economy, isn't it?
NEUT2|Well, to some extent.
BEAR3|I mean, obviously exporters are going to be pleased to have a falling pound.
NEUT4|Not so much importers, not so much holidaymakers.
NEUT5|But actually, in a world of currency wars, which is what we're really.
NEUT6|Into actually falling apart, falling currencies is what everybody is wanting is what's the Europe?
NEUT7|Europeans want what the Japanese want.
BULL8|So in the short term, yes, actually probably there is some benefit to having a weaker currency, and if we look at China, this is our first chart.
NEUT9|What's this chart shows which is the impact on broader British companies?
NEUT10|Footsie 100 isn't that important as we have seen in the past with the Scottish referendum.
BEAR11|And as we've seen in the run up in the fit last few weeks, there not terribly bothered by Brexit.
NEUT12|This is the kind of thing that worries them.
NEUT13|In October of 2014, Big Global uncertainty down came the Footsie in December that same year, big oil pressures down came with the Footsie and it just goes to show that the Footsie 100 companies are not so related to the UK economy.
NEUT14|They're much more global in nature and how big has the pounds for being?
BEAR15|I mean this week alone it's fallen 2%.
NEUT16|How big is this fall in kind of the grand scheme of things?
NEUT17|Well, there's no doubt.
NEUT18|I think we'll see in the next chart.
NEUT19|There's no doubt this is a major significant full review.
NEUT20|Look at the performance of Sterling in the last 12 months.
NEUT21|Is what it shows.
NEUT22|This is, you're starting to see it gradually tail off and sort of the start of the end of last year and then it's really.
NEUT23|How does big steeple?
BEAR24|But remember there have been other pressures on Sterling as there have been on all other currencies.
BEAR25|There's been the oil pressure.
BEAR26|There's been worries about China and that is the that is also contributing to falls in Sterling as it has been with other currencies so.
NEUT27|We can't simply say that this is entirely Brexit related, but there is no doubt this is a significant fall in Sterling when you compare it to other major moments such as 1992 at the ERM crisis such as 2008 and the global financial crisis is it's in that territory, so the dates now set the referendum Roger June 23rd and the pounds training about 141 against the dollar.
BEAR28|Now that's very near 7 year lows as it got further to fall.
BEAR29|Yes, it's probably has, but it's going to be falling on the basis of what the opinion polls say.
NEUT30|But also again, what?
NEUT31|What are the big global events take place?
NEUT32|So while Brexit probably has, you know 1/3 to 1/2 of the of the weight in terms of how the pound is going to perform.
BEAR33|It's not by any means the only issue, so we will see the currency fall and remember after June the 23rd.
BULL34|If there is a vote to stay in then we could see a very big rebound in Sterling taking place.
NEUT35|A lot of people are positioning themselves to make sure they're ready for that moment.
NEUT36|So it's not just about how stone is going to perform up until June 23rd, after if the vote is to stay in Sterling rebound.
NEUT37|That's the big thing people are watching.
NEUT38|Roger.
BULL39|"Thanks very much."""
