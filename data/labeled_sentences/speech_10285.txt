NEUT0|"""So who does win the race to 10?"
NEUT1|Let's get to the head to head comparison.
BULL2|Right now Ford sells for roughly 10 times next year's earnings estimates much cheaper than GE at more than 20 times earnings.
NEUT3|Given that theories are depressed, you could look at the other metrics, but she is much more expensive on a cash flow basis to those other two metrics that we're looking at.
BULL4|In short, Ford is a much clearer value play, and I also think it has a better story.
NEUT5|Sure, GE score aerospace business will come back eventually.
NEUT6|Before its core auto market is coming back now and the F-150 is going to go electric in a couple of years.
NEUT7|Right now the family trying to meet the man used prices are through the roof plus fours.
BULL8|Got more momentum.
NEUT9|It's also much closer to the finish line.
NEUT10|Bottom line.
NEUT11|Longer term.
BULL12|I think both Ford and General Electric are headed back to double digits, but if you only want one one of these Robin Hood favors in your portfolio, I would go with pork.
