NEUT0|"""As we countdown to the abide inauguration, good time to bring up Jim's investment themes for 2021."
NEUT1|You zeroing down on one gym.
NEUT2|Well, I think that there is one which is if you go to 5G we are in a collision course the likes of which I don't think we've ever seen.
BEAR3|It's a worldwide chip shortage.
NEUT4|There simply aren't enough chips to go around.
NEUT5|It's not vaccine like 'cause life and death, but it's not just autos.
NEUT6|There simply aren't enough chips to make every single device we have.
NEUT7|We.
BEAR8|Ended up getting real bottleneck at Taiwan Semi.
NEUT9|They're spending 25 to 28 billion or open it up.
NEUT10|But David when I talk about 5G what I'm talking about is a just a hug, a monster that's devouring all the chips that would have normally gone throughout the system, whether it be 5G for Apple would be 5G for up for towers weather, be 5G to to make it so that the world is connected to each other.
NEUT11|That is the single greatest bottleneck theme.
NEUT12|Other than vaccines at this very moment also infects.
NEUT13|A lot of other areas, including e-commerce, even EV.
NEUT14|Everybody needs more chips.
NEUT15|I've never seen a shortage like this, that's interesting.
NEUT16|Is there a particular?
NEUT17|Area of chips that's in truly short supply or CPI automobile OK right?
NEUT18|I honestly I mean I don't think that there is a major CEO in this country who have asked what the problem is right now.
NEUT19|Who has anything involving device that wouldn't say we can't get the chips.
NEUT20|Well Internet of Things is of course a theme that we've discussed in relation to 5G, and it's not just about being able to get a download a movie more quickly, right phone?
NEUT21|It's really the.
NEUT22|Applications in the enterprise.
NEUT23|Given the lack of latency are going to be dramatic as this really still slowly moves into the into the enterprise into a factory into a workplace in some way into places where automation is very important to Jim's point, and so chips become even more important that can communicate with the 5G signal essentially right, Jim.
NEUT24|And by the way, always worth mentioning $95 billion, including clearing costs, was spent by the we don't know who yet, actually, but Verizon and 18 T amongst them.
NEUT25|On that spectrum again to help with their 5G?
NEUT26|Yeah, 95 billion.
NEUT27|That's incredible amount of money spent in coral, the automobile dealers when you watched him go Purple day, you watch forgot the thing that is making so they may not have the blowouts in the first half is they can't get the chips because the automobile business I was listening marabella this morning.
NEUT28|The automobile business is the hottest.
NEUT29|I can recall.
BEAR30|The housing market is the hottest.
BEAR31|There's only two months supply, we are just can supply constrained.
NEUT32|With many things.
NEUT33|Axes.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
