BULL0|"""Skinny in a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 15th of December, 2022.
NEUT2|States second day of the week.
BEAR3|We're at #30 Dash Weaver ticker, dash, so for dash against BTC, things are still very bearish for Dash or still down the skinny pink line here we are still in a bearish trend.
NEUT4|Believe it or not, we're not bullish yet.
NEUT5|For Dash things are not bullish.
NEUT6|Setting may be compelled to feel like dashes going bullish, but now things are not bullish.
BEAR7|We're still very bearish for Dash.
NEUT8|So you're going to be very, very careful about going into a tree too soon for Dash.
NEUT9|Could this be the end and could we start forming reversals for lash potentially?
NEUT10|But I don't see any clear River such a patterns yet, so be very, very careful about going to trade too soon, right?
NEUT11|Let's move onto Dash against USD, but before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you do.
BULL12|More dashing documents be low for dash against USD.
NEUT13|Yeah, we're not exactly sure what that is doing.
NEUT14|We're hoping that hoping hoping doesn't is going to be hoping that it will form.
NEUT15|A proper head over here and then we get a right shoulder in problem we stopped and you boot trend.
NEUT16|However, things are not really that bullish yet.
NEUT17|You know this in itself is another.
NEUT18|In resistance line and so you could really call this another type of a inverse head and shoulders like this could be the inverse head and shoulders, not this right.
NEUT19|Again, we're not exactly sure the trade is.
NEUT20|Dash is not exactly what I would consider as tradeable at this point of time.
NEUT21|No clear tradeable chapters.
NEUT22|4 dash not at this point of time.
NEUT23|So you gotta be very careful about going to trade too soon.
NEUT24|We might get mountain ranges and we could still drop lower writer if you start forming valleys right?
NEUT25|If you keep seeing valleys then yes.
BULL26|Potentially Dash could rise higher, but I think more likely than not dash.
NEUT27|It's going to follow BTC.
BEAR28|BTC drops.
NEUT29|Dash is very likely going to drop yourself, so be very, very careful about going to a trade tool soon.
BEAR30|Dash against BC is still in a bearish trend and we could still continue the Bearishness 4 dash against BTC so be careful.
NEUT31|Alright, I guess I see from my dash technical analysis.
BULL32|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL33|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT34|"I shall see you in the next video."""
