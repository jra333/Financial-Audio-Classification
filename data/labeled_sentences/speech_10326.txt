NEUT0|"""Today it's a big story on Jane Fraser at City who officially takes over today."
BEAR1|Yeah, I mean I, I thought the count to make peace was good and I had her on mad money and the stock is hated right now.
NEUT2|I don't know why so sad.
NEUT3|18 times earnings, 2 1/2 percent yield.
BULL4|She guaranteed that Christmas would be good and it was.
NEUT5|She's a person of your word.
NEUT6|Jane Fraser comes in.
NEUT7|I've always felt that when would a major bank be run by a woman given the fact that the finances in so many households are run by women, and I think that this is a great advantage for city.
NEUT8|If they take if they really make it clear that Jane Frazier is coming in and wants to do well for the American consumer.
NEUT9|Now obviously this worldwide company David.
BULL10|The reason why I think this is so significant is because we're really starting to see some women get to higher levels.
BEAR11|We're not seeing minorities get to higher levels, which is disappointing.
NEUT12|But women are starting to get.
NEUT13|I had two women CEO's on Friday.
NEUT14|I mean we're seeing women in tech.
NEUT15|We're seeing women in banking, so maybe the glass ceiling to some degree.
NEUT16|Is being cracked maybe maybe not enough?
NEUT17|Obviously not know Anne in banking.
NEUT18|It's interesting.
NEUT19|It's going to be very interesting to see.
NEUT20|I mean she comes in at a crucial juncture.
NEUT21|You heard Mike Mayo talking earlier on Squawk Box, saying some mean he typically will say some things that others will know why she wasn't involved.
NEUT22|You know, I don't want to quote him.
NEUT23|I mean I heard it like but I can't remember exactly but he didn't mince words when he came to the disaster.
NEUT24|He seemed to feel that that.
NEUT25|City was very recently yeah.
NEUT26|He recently in terms of their systems failure.
NEUT27|Well there were issues that Revlon business and they don't have.
NEUT28|They're not getting the money back.
NEUT29|No, you saw the most recent ruling from a judge.
NEUT30|I think half a billion of it was not returned and doesn't need to be.
NEUT31|Those were the payment that was incorrectly sent by Citadel on behalf of Revlon that city cities money not Revlon.
BEAR32|But this the stock is still below tangible book so they could continue to buy.
NEUT33|I'd like to see your analysis of whether she wants to continue to buy the way that my Michael Corbett did.
NEUT34|I do think that JP Morgan is still by far.
BULL35|The banks here though overall, I mean they've had a great move as a group.
NEUT36|Over the course of the year you point out JP Morgan.
BEAR37|I mean, it is up 17% off.
NEUT38|Its most recent highs, but you know you're still talking about very close to its all time highs, right?
NEUT39|Well, you covered.
NEUT40|The situation is called whereas rates go up.
NEUT41|People love him until rates go up so much that people, him and business activities is slowed down.
BEAR42|We do need you mentioned lumber on the very jarring Home Depot call lumbers doubled in a year.
NEUT43|Copper was at $4.17.
NEUT44|I mean no copper.
NEUT45|There's been two minds that have been restarted, so there's possibilities in the Baltic freighters come down.
NEUT46|But you know, Carl, that at a certain point people are going to say, wait a second?
BEAR47|Isn't housing good cool because rates are too high housing there's you can get a three and a quarter conforming right now, which is still really, really low.
BEAR48|But I do think that the people who love the banks turn on them very quickly if they hear anything bad about bad loans.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
