NEUT0|"""If we talk about the share price in the next week or two, I believe as well, just trade between 2:00 and $235 to like $250 sixty dollars so so remain in some kind of range trading."
BEAR1|But honestly speaking Alibaba its share price has already left behind all of the ATM XJ, especially Tencent, and also like State owned media.
NEUT2|The phrase prominent Chinese business leader not Jack MA, but Hoekema instead of Jack Ma so we can see like money inflow from mainland rootstock Connect.
NEUT3|Actually most of the mainland investor.
NEUT4|They are more like Pro Pen sent instead of Alibaba and especially when we when we take a closer look to all the data from the stock Connect in recent weeks.
NEUT5|So in a longer term I think Alibaba share price.
BULL6|Will remain stable, but $0.10 will definitely outperform Alibaba in the next in the short term.
NEUT7|You said that you thought that the earnings were already in the share price, so maybe today's some sell on the news as well.
NEUT8|But what needs to happen to get back to the October high and the share price?
NEUT9|And when do you think that might possibly be achievable?
NEUT10|OK, this is a good question indeed.
NEUT11|Speaking, we have to wait until Ant Group resume its IPO.
NEUT12|I mean, maybe within this year.
NEUT13|I don't know when, but when we talk about the regulations over Alibaba, we're not talking only about.
NEUT14|I mean the regulation pressures from all the Internet operated financial services.
NEUT15|Because like state owned banks don't sustain.
NEUT16|But Alibaba is simply not staying on company.
NEUT17|So when we talk about the financial services industry, I think Chinese regulations will give more and more pressure on dosed like oligopoly operators including Alibaba and also enter trust lawsuit is in other case.
NEUT18|Take care, I just want to quickly get your response here.
NEUT19|I'm just looking at Alibaba.
NEUT20|Look planning to issue debt to $5 billion in the offering.
BULL21|Do you think investors are going to be keen on appointing money here so that it can help boost its working capital?
NEUT22|What is your take?
NEUT23|Well, if we have to choose between the bond and the chair, I mean the equity, I'll pick the equity instead of the bomb.
NEUT24|But when we talk about this.
NEUT25|I mean Alibaba future growth also driven by not only e-commerce but also cloud computing.
BULL26|I think this bond issue will help the company to grow its business.
NEUT27|I mean faster to tackle order problem, especially from the regulatory tree pressure.
NEUT28|So there is a good investment for like maybe some of the insurance company and even some of the banks but not for individual.
NEUT29|"Faster."""
