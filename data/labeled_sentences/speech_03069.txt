NEUT0|"""Hey, it's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, the bloodshed continues on Facebook here an I mean this downtrend has been going on for quite awhile but the big dynamic that occurred today was you know Facebook.
BULL5|I mean it really was, it was doing its best to try to level off to try to build that hire low right here at the 262 mark quick history.
NEUT6|You know going through the history here you can see that right there, it originally bounced.
NEUT7|Price regionally held.
BEAR8|Price bounce.
BEAR9|Price came back down and was sitting right at that level again going into today.
NEUT10|So the big question Mark was hey, is there going to be some sort of double bottom bounce back to upside and the market gave the answer.
BEAR11|Note there is no double bottom things just got that much nastier going forward.
NEUT12|So now 262 definitely plays a vital role moving forward and that this role is just dependent on a very foundational rule in technical analysis, which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance, so if the price does try to stabilize out.
NEUT13|And then work away, you know back up which you know right now.
NEUT14|Nice little green candle.
NEUT15|But if that green candle is going to lead to any sort of bigger bounce, the first true test of any sort of bounds again is right up there.
NEUT16|At 262 four, you know that reason of it was a former area of support, so now you'd expect it to act as resistance as far as levels of support and concern.
NEUT17|Now, first key level, nothing fancy or complicated, just simply a question of where the where did the bleeding finally stopped today, and that was down there at 250, so 250.
NEUT18|Going to be the first key level of support.
NEUT19|And at that level cannot quite hold up.
NEUT20|Next level of support after that would then be down there.
NEUT21|Let's see what is that?
NEUT22|The two 4750 mark so 250 and then two 4750 next couple of key levels of support to watch moving forward.
BEAR23|But yeah All in all like I said that breakdown today was pretty significant.
NEUT24|'cause going into the day like you said you had the double bottom potential.
NEUT25|But yeah there is just simply no double bottom, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around on Friday 1st off.
BULL26|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT28|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR32|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT37|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT38|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT39|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT40|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT41|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
