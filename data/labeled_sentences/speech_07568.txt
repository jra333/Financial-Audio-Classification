BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about Walmart.
NEUT2|So Walmart does retail.
BULL3|They also have the highest revenue of any U.S. company.
NEUT4|Publicly anyway.
NEUT5|Internationally, I think Saudi Aramco is beating them, but they weren't public couple years ago.
BULL6|So you know current surprise $128.89, which gives the market cap of $365 billion revenue is 559 billion, which is up from 524, which is quite the significant increase earnings of $13.5 billion, pretty much in line with previous years.
NEUT7|And that gives them a PE of 20 with a forward PE of 24 which is.
BULL8|Pretty decent actually.
NEUT9|When I started working for Walmart.
NEUT10|He had a PE of well below 20 because I guess no one believed that they could grow.
NEUT11|I don't know, didn't hear 1.71% with a paired ratio of 45%, which is also pretty nice.
NEUT12|Total assets $252 billion.
NEUT13|Total liabilities $165 billion, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $81 billion.
BULL14|An that's decent balance sheet.
NEUT15|At the very least, really haven't had that in awhile.
BULL16|Stockholders equity being more than 20% of the market cap, which is OK.
BULL17|I guess it's not great, but you know, risk factor is Amazon mostly there's a couple other things that we need to be worried about, but overall, I think beyond Amazon growing at a rapid pace.
NEUT18|Still, even with a revenue of like 350 billion or something like that.
NEUT19|Obviously the biggest risk factor.
BEAR20|Also, Amazon getting into the health care market is kind of a problem and there's a few companies there kind of trying to gain market share, but target probably one of the biggest containers there.
NEUT21|So overall for growth, investor Walmart really has never been company to invest in.
NEUT22|I don't expect it to change either for a dividend investor, I think the safety of principle here.
BULL23|It is very important and the dividend is not actually that bad, even though you know bond yields have increased significantly.
BULL24|But payout ratio is pretty nice.
BULL25|Dividend yield is decent.
NEUT26|Definitely worth a closer look and for a value investor edipi of 20, which I don't know how Yahoo Finance calculates the PE.
BULL27|But atopy of 20.
NEUT28|I think this is definitely worth a closer look at four P of 24 is slightly worse, but I think still for many reasons worth it because.
NEUT29|It's a very safe company.
BEAR30|It's a very stable company and current growth is not actually that bad.
NEUT31|So because of the stability and the continued growth, I think it's definitely worth a closer look.
NEUT32|For many people.
NEUT33|That's it for me.
