NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video traders."
NEUT1|And if you're new to the channel, welcome to charting trends for trading.
NEUT2|Tesla TJ.
NEUT3|Let's take a look at the chart.
BEAR4|Here's the chart where on a 10 day 10 minute chart here, as you can see, today was not great and we've been very inconsistent lately off the open just plummeting down, crashing blew the support at 8:42 and then starting to recover a little bit and just kind of consolidating into the close around this 848 level.
BEAR5|But we're holding the downtrend still bearish, but now back into the middle of really this price range from the previous 2-3 weeks or so an it seems that Tesla, at least today was.
BULL6|Lagging behind the market, let's take a look at spy real Quick Spy actually came out very strong.
BULL7|Shot up an you know, tested this previous downtrend from the past few days before continuing on upwards and eventually making new all time highs today from a few weeks ago.
BULL8|This was the previous all time high round three 8586 so now we broke that just before the close and continuing up in after hours.
NEUT9|NASDAQ as well.
NEUT10|Take a look at that chart briefly, almost towards this, all time high at three 3138, but again very strong came out tested this support just briefly and then just grinding higher all day long and very strong into the close whereas Tesla again.
BULL11|Lagging behind so holding the downtrend testing supports to the downside and just consolidating into the middle of this old price range.
BEAR12|So tomorrow very very tough to call.
NEUT13|No idea what we're going to see.
BULL14|We could see a little bit of a catch up if the spy is strong we might see a pop off the open catching up to the market going up to test the downtrend.
NEUT15|Or who knows.
NEUT16|I think more likely what we'll see is more consolidation into the middle of this old price range.
NEUT17|Between 8:50 and 8:40, or even a test, and a failure to hold this support here at 842 again.
NEUT18|But I honestly expect us to close right around eight 43844 tomorrow, but you could see it Pop.
BEAR19|You could see a drop.
BEAR20|It's very tough to call when it's being inconsistent with the market, but as far as today's action, obviously bearish holding the downtrend.
BULL21|But I think the key here is that we're starting to consolidate into the middle of this price range again.
NEUT22|Where we could go up or down?
