BEAR0|"""The Wall Street forecasters struggle just like investors to figure out the outlook for trade and its effects on growth."
NEUT1|Next year.
BULL2|In general, they say, prolonging the trade war and increasing tariffs, three effects one increases downside risk to the economy and limits the potential for an upside surprise.
BULL3|It also confirms their modest growth forecast for next year.
NEUT4|Some economists have baked in what they call trade, peace, and some just aren't buying a Goldman Sachs.
BULL5|Riding a member quote, we expect the drag from trade from the trade war to fade gradually, although much could still go wrong.
BULL6|We now expect a Phase one agreement to be signed in coming weeks.
NEUT7|That was back in November 22nd.
NEUT8|But after the president yesterday said there may not be a trade deal until after the 2020 elections, Mike Feroli at JP Morgan told me quote we never swung all the way to thinking that trade piece was breaking out.
NEUT9|So it's not like we have to do a big pivot here.
BULL10|Goldman has a more upbeat 2020 outlook at 2.3% there on the right side of the survey.
NEUT11|We did yesterday.
NEUT12|They are banking on trade piece.
NEUT13|JPMorgan, not banking on at all.
BEAR14|Only 1 1/2 percent UBS, most pessimistic of all.
NEUT15|At one point 1 we contacted a half dozen economists.
NEUT16|After the president's comments.
NEUT17|Most have just about had it with taking out the erasers, several inclined to assume the worst on trade and be pleasantly surprised if they're wrong.
NEUT18|Is there a trend to the growth and how it ebbs and flows during the year?
NEUT19|So what you see is is not only did we ask everybody their annual and then we averaged all that up to the average.
NEUT20|By the way, is 1 seven there.
NEUT21|What we see is that there's a bit of a debate.
NEUT22|Is the fourth quarter right now, or the first quarter?
BEAR23|The bottom of this slowdown and what you see is that it goes to 1 1/2 now.
BULL24|"Kind of 1 1/2 on the next quarter and then it gradually ticks back up, but it only gets to 2% on average by the end of the fourth quarter next year."""
