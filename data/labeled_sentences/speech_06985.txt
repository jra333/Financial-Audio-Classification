BEAR0|"""You know the US has got a low inflation problem, it's it's."
NEUT1|It's a similar message that everybody every other central banks been getting.
BULL2|But because the US has had this fantastic fiscal stimulus and actually the economies in better structural shape, it the message is taking longer to come through.
BEAR3|But obviously central banks everywhere is struggling with delivering their inflation mandates and most many central banks are trying harder to get there.
NEUT4|Needs to be a combination of things, clearly monetary policy is in operation where countries have fiscal capacity, fiscal policy as well.
BULL5|But also I think some acceptance that the growth environment is structurally changed.
NEUT6|It's structurally different.
NEUT7|We can't just rely on central banks.
NEUT8|We need to work harder on the, you know, reform side of the economy.
BULL9|Developing productivity growth, utilizing existing resources more effectively.
NEUT10|Do you see any chance of that happening anytime soon?
BEAR11|Look at various by country in most countries are reporting structurally weaker productivity growth.
NEUT12|I think that also relates to this much more retreat repressed credit environment, but certainly there's lots of things countries can do.
NEUT13|It's about the political will, and finding political agreement and an unambiguously that is more complicated almost everywhere.
NEUT14|But there are things that you know definitely can be can be done to kind of run gun the system and get things moving.
NEUT15|And governments need to get on with it.
NEUT16|Aside from the G20, because that's going to be the Big Sur at the weekend into early next week, but a number of central banks meeting next week as well where you are in Australia, what do you think the odds are that we're going to see a follow up rate cut there?
NEUT17|Look the language from the Reserve Bank.
NEUT18|Spend as clear as I can ever recall it.
NEUT19|I think people would be very surprised if there wasn't a rate cut next week.
NEUT20|There's there's more debate about when the next easing comes.
BULL21|We expect an easing in July, so that would be three rate cuts in a row.
NEUT22|That is historically unusual, but we are in historically unusual times.
BULL23|The Reserve Bank has laid out quite a strong framework related to unemployment.
BEAR24|Unemployment is more than half a percent away from their target.
NEUT25|I think it's going to take more than two rate cuts to get there.
NEUT26|So you are penciling in three.
NEUT27|What was the timeline on that?
NEUT28|So we've had one in in June.
NEUT29|We think both July and August.
NEUT30|You'll get rate cuts in Australia and then you know that has implications elsewhere.
NEUT31|Of course as well, because to the extent particularly small open economies you know would like their exchange rates to be part of their monetary policy mechanism.
NEUT32|New Zealand probably once a week a currency.
BULL33|We've had some monetary easing in in the Philippines.
NEUT34|Were looking for some in India and Korea.
BEAR35|They probably want weaker exchange rates as well and the more one central bank goes, it does kind of add to the case for more of them to ease.
NEUT36|Hey everybody, it's Hadley.
