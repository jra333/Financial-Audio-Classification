BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about Google.
NEUT2|Or you know, that's not what the company is called anymore.
NEUT3|I guess.
NEUT4|So Alphabet so they make Chrome.
NEUT5|Also Google you know also phone these days so current stock price is $21121.90 which gives the market cap of $1.42 trillion.
NEUT6|Revenue $182.5 billion earnings $40.3 billion, which gives them a PE of 36 with a forward PE of 32.
NEUT7|So exactly the same as Apple.
NEUT8|Not exactly, but pretty kills kills enough dividend zero.
NEUT9|I don't really expect that to change, but for a company that makes a profit of $40 billion, you would think they would have a dividend eventually.
NEUT10|Obviously these days, stock buybacks are pretty common, so could just go that way.
NEUT11|Total assets $319 billion.
BULL12|Total liabilities $97 billion, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $222 billion and a really nice balance sheet.
NEUT13|I really like the assets to liabilities ratio here.
BEAR14|Obviously even $200 billion pales in comparison to the 1.4 trillion in market cap so.
NEUT15|But it's a really nice balance sheet.
NEUT16|Risk factors are pretty much none, so the biggest search engine in the world is Google and the second biggest is YouTube, which is also Google so.
NEUT17|Fears many products that they have that there are competitors for, but it seems like none of them really come close.
NEUT18|So overall, I don't think there are any risk factors.
NEUT19|Google is more in the business objects of disrupting other companies than being disrupted by other companies, and so I don't think that there will be many new risk factors coming out.
NEUT20|So for growth, investor growth of 10 ish percent.
NEUT21|Obviously not that interesting, probably still a decent buy, but.
NEUT22|Definitely better opportunities out there for dividend investor, there's no dividend, so obviously nothing to see here for a value investor.
NEUT23|I really like this balance sheet.
BULL24|I really do like the revenue growth, earnings growth as well.
NEUT25|That P is just slightly too high, but I still wouldn't blame anyone for investing in this because I think that the revenue growth kind of makes up for it.
NEUT26|Also, it's a very stable company, a very safe company, and I think that they're going to be around for a long time, so if you're a value investor, definitely look into this.
NEUT27|But if the P is just too high for you, I kind of like to keep it under 20 or under 15 if you can find that.
BEAR28|So PE of 36 isn't great, but I don't expect that to come down a whole lot.
NEUT29|That's it for me.
NEUT30|For today.
