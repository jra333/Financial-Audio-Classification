NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, after a good strong day on Friday, the price gap down today and I don't want to ruin the chart or anything like that, but in the near term it definitely is Apple.
NEUT5|Now looking a little shaky here and the quote unquote shaky point will call it that a lot of people are going to be watching, so this is not some sort of great discovery on my part is right here at one 2850.
NEUT6|If you go back through the history of the chart, you can see this carries quite a bit of history behind it.
NEUT7|You can see right there acted as support, acted as support, and then you Fast forward to today once again opening 30 minutes acted as support.
NEUT8|And then even you know this afternoon, never quite hit it exactly again, but is well within range and then also looking back at past history, you can see that when the price does breakdown blow up, it does tend to produce pretty big movements of the downside, right?
BEAR9|There broke down below it.
NEUT10|Right there, broke down, blow it.
NEUT11|Now the tricky part airs every time it breaks down, but it never maintains and then the price just snaps back upwards.
NEUT12|So that's what a lot of people are going to be serving.
NEUT13|Observing as yes one 2050 is broken.
NEUT14|It could very well make a pretty significant quick move to the downside, but I mean, is that actually a legitimate break?
NEUT15|While history suggests that the main break point in order to get kind of bearish confirmation would be down there around the one 2675 marks, a 128, fifty one 2675 two main areas of support.
NEUT16|If the price does try to bounce back upwards in the near term, that first key battleground is going to be that purple line there.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Moving average keyword or keyword being moving.
NEUT19|So yes, right now it's at 1:30.
NEUT20|Oh nine.
NEUT21|But because that line is going to be moving around, that value will change, but ballpark right around 1:30 and the next key level after that would be the 200.
NEUT22|Moving average current value of that right up there around 1:31 twenty.
NEUT23|But All in all, the week is young, still four days left.
NEUT24|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT25|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT26|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT31|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
