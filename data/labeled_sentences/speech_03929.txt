NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|I'm like from stocked up.
NEUT2|Today is February 28th of 2019 and it's a Thursday night, So what that means is weekly options are super super cheap right now because there's only one day left.
NEUT3|You know, tomorrow Friday until they expire.
NEUT4|So what I did the before market close today is that scanned for the options that have like the cheapest, like the least expected move for tomorrow.
NEUT5|Alright, one of them is KO the other.
NEUT6|Is Disney right?
NEUT7|Weren't we going over KO in this video?
NEUT8|But what I did is I saw that at the time kayos at about $45.50.
NEUT9|So what I did is I straddled KO for that, So what I did is I bought a KO at the money straddle for $28.00 right?
NEUT10|This is going to expire tomorrow so I bought the call 45 five in the put 45 five.
NEUT11|I bought it for $28.00, So what that means?
NEUT12|So what I need is I need ko to either go to $45.22 or lower or $45.00 in 78 center higher alright?
NEUT13|That's my break even price if it goes any higher any lower that's pure profit.
NEUT14|So let's look at a potential set up for tomorrow.
NEUT15|Let's say we see.
NEUT16|So we see chaos on an uptrend, right?
NEUT17|Let's say it goes to 46 alright.
NEUT18|That means that my straddle will be worth $50 now, so I almost doubled my investment.
NEUT19|Alright, the call would go to $50 or $0.50 in the money in the put will go to 0.
NEUT20|But the best part of this is that it doesn't matter if Ko goes up or down tomorrow.
NEUT21|Either way, I'm gonna make money as long as it moves.
NEUT22|It's a risky play.
NEUT23|There's one day left in the options, but it's ridiculously cheap that I thought it was definitely worth a play.
NEUT24|Alright, I'm also playing Disney, I straddled Disney at 113 but I like KO.
NEUT25|You know it's a gamble, yes, but the risk is not that much.
NEUT26|Only $28.00 per unit and the rewards can be over double my money.
NEUT27|"Alright, if you guys have any questions on this strategy let me know, but other than that, thanks for watching."""
