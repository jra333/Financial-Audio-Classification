NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|This is the cartographer from by the book trading.
NEUT2|I'm going to be quickly going over NFLX that is Netflix.
NEUT3|So the first thing I want you to see here about Netflix.
NEUT4|Is that it has been operating within this channel right here?
NEUT5|Right here for a very long time now.
NEUT6|Since March.
BEAR7|Recently it dipped down into a lower area.
NEUT8|It went back up, back up into that Channel, but it brings us to this area right here.
NEUT9|Underneath the 560 area where it has been rejected.
NEUT10|And the 570 area right above it, where has also been rejected.
NEUT11|So the question is, is it going to stay in this channel or is it going to come back down?
NEUT12|They report earnings on the 20th.
BEAR13|Last time Netflix ran up.
NEUT14|I believe is about $100 for earnings.
BULL15|And I'm expecting them to break right through this 570 resistance.
BULL16|I'm expecting them to break through this.
NEUT17|Upper end of this channel here around 6:10.
NEUT18|And guys, I don't know how high Netflix can go.
BULL19|Your guess is as good as mine, but this looks like a really solid earnings play.
NEUT20|Let me know what you guys think.
NEUT21|Drop your thumbs up.
NEUT22|Hit me up in the comments section.
