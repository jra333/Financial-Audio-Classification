NEUT0|"""Alright, market timing Academy here."
NEUT1|Today is October 21st and we are here with your weekly stock analysis.
NEUT2|This week we're going to take a look at Netflix, a stock that most of us are familiar with.
NEUT3|We recommended this stock back here and January as it broke out here on a very, very interesting flat base, but it broke out with major major major volume.
NEUT4|As you can see through here.
NEUT5|Nonetheless, if you got into it at that point you got in at a very good price and you see there was a resulting.
BULL6|Solid uptrend now.
NEUT7|The next time we highlighted this stock was back here as it came through this double bottom base and your precise by point is you'll recall as as it crosses through resistance, which is the midpoint high of that base.
NEUT8|And that breakout came right here through this period of time, which was what was it?
NEUT9|August 10th you got into the stock at roughly $125 a share.
BULL10|Now since then the stock is again had had a nice move here to the upside.
BULL11|Creating kind of a nice channel and we recommended the stock again as it came down and bounced off of.
BEAR12|You know this area as it was approaching back into the 50 day moving area average area and now the stock is gapped.
BULL13|Way to the upside today.
NEUT14|Which is this period of time and that was based off of the company having some just ridiculously good earnings and so Netflix again you know it's it's changing the way that you're accessing your entertainment videos and you no longer go to blockbusters.
NEUT15|Matter of fact, they you know they.
NEUT16|They declared bankruptcy.
NEUT17|As you're well aware, Netflix is reinventing that industry, and so at the market timing Academy, you know that's exactly what we look for.
NEUT18|Is companies that are doing something new something new to their industry?
NEUT19|And Netflix is probably a perfect example of that.
NEUT20|Now, at this point you were into this stock at roughly $125 a share.
BULL21|That's trading it right around 175, which means you're up about 42% look.
NEUT22|The bottom line is you're going to want to.
NEUT23|I'm going to come into this area a little bit.
BULL24|Closer here so I can show you this, but you're sitting right here at roughly $175 a share it you're going to want to bring your stop right up underneath this thing, and you're going to want to base it off of the prior high and so bottom line, you're up 42%.
NEUT25|This stock is probably going to make a significant run from this point on, but a lot of the times when you see a stock gap to the upside like that, you want to get your stuff right under it and protect your profits.
BULL26|I mean, my word, you know 42% move in a stock is a pretty good move.
NEUT27|Now if you bought it right here in this area off of the bounce on the 50 day moving average you rented it roughly 100.
NEUT28|$45.00 A share, which means let me just do the math here.
NEUT29|140 -- 175 / 145 you're in Europe, roughly 2025% again, when a stock moves that quickly that much if you got lucky number one.
NEUT30|But #2, it typically has more to go.
NEUT31|But point being is get your stop right up here underneath where you're at right now, which is the prior high or the breakout point from this little base that typically becomes support once it gets above that so.
