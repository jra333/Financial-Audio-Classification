BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on?"
NEUT1|Guys?
NEUT2|Welcome back to a brand new video here on South Academy.
NEUT3|My name is Gabe Moses, and in today's video, let's take a look at Litecoin against the USD.
NEUT4|If you're new to the channel, a huge welcome to you.
NEUT5|My name is Gabe Moses and I do daily cryptocurrency videos, so that's the type of content that you're looking for.

NEUT8|I don't charge, you know.
NEUT9|No yearly fees, no monthly fees.
BULL10|Nothing $0.00, so right here looking at Litecoin welcome, fantastic as always.
NEUT11|I'm going to be showing you our medium term target if you haven't watched our short term analysis, which is this video I'm going to link it above.
NEUT12|Go watch it and then come back to this one.
NEUT13|'cause it's most likely that we go for that short term and then play this medium term.
NEUT14|So looking at Litecoin, Litecoin is doing his thing.
NEUT15|It's in this symmetrical triangle beauty, so in the coming days weeks I'm expecting a retest.
NEUT16|At this major resistance level, so we're going to do our thing.
NEUT17|And then the big question is, can we break above this resistance level?
NEUT18|OK, can we break above or not?
NEUT19|'cause if we do up we go OK. From there you're looking at about let's find out.
NEUT20|So give or take you're looking at about.
NEUT21|287 to 200.
NEUT22|Just do that.
NEUT23|So yeah, 287 to around 291 guys, you guys if you've been in the channel so much confluence at this $300 range.
NEUT24|So that's only if we break above and vice versa if we break through.
BEAR25|The downside, which is very likely, especially in a bull market.
NEUT26|You're looking so once again, this is very unlikely.
NEUT27|You're looking at $89.00, which means that we go in a bear market and of course we are nowhere near a bear market.
NEUT28|Therefore this scenario I'm going to remove and I'm looking forward with this $300 range.
