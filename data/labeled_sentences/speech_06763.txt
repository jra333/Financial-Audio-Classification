NEUT0|"""I can do volume buttons, home buttons, earpieces, microphone, speakers, screens, LCD's, batteries."
NEUT1|To be honest I can do almost anything.
NEUT2|It's a little bit of a rush like in the adrenaline rush.
NEUT3|I would say 'cause you really don't want to screw up.
NEUT4|I'm learning new things when I'm doing it.
NEUT5|I find it kind of like an experience like not many kids like at the experience to kind of like start a business like have a store.
NEUT6|I guess I enjoy doing it, but it was a good way to like make a couple like extra dollars to like spend in the summer.
NEUT7|But now it's kind of like I don't know.
NEUT8|It's like led me to like learn how to like invest in the stock market and other things like that.
NEUT9|When I was 12 my mom's phone just kind of randomly shut off and she it was time for her upgrade anyway so she said if you can fix it then you can have it.
NEUT10|It looked hard, but I felt like I could do it and I fixed it and I did sell it.
NEUT11|I do most of my cells in the summer.
NEUT12|I met a man who had a pop up store and he gave me a spot in the store and I paid him like a percent of my sales and last summer I think it was probably around 20, three, $24,000 in sales.
BULL13|I put most of it into the stock market so far, and that's really helped.
NEUT14|I put it into the S&P and Apple.
BEAR15|I bought it like 100 and it dropped down to like 90 and I'm like Oh no, no like what did I do?
NEUT16|This is like Apple stock and now it's up to like 146.
NEUT17|I think it is today 147.
NEUT18|It was at 1:55 a week ago.
NEUT19|I like check it like daily and this is probably the part that you have to be most careful with because if you break any connectors here.
NEUT20|Your.
NEUT21|Fingerprint will never work again.
NEUT22|I work like 6 hours a day in the summer and a lot of my friends like don't really work.
NEUT23|They just like kind of chill, hang around and go to the beach.
NEUT24|You know, whenever they want.
NEUT25|Sometimes it can be like maybe a little annoying to like not have like teenagers, life where I can just do like anything.
NEUT26|Where whenever I want to but I know that's not not going to be realistic in the later world.
NEUT27|I did teach one kid how to do it.
NEUT28|I mean, I taught him like the basics, what he needed to do, where you could get the screens.
NEUT29|I gave him tools like aim all that stuff.
NEUT30|I just got him started but I know my brother is trying to start a business with a couple of his friends.
NEUT31|So like I don't know.
NEUT32|It's kind of like really like, sparked something within my friends and my siblings.
NEUT33|I know I'm trying to get them to start fixing iPhones just in case I'm out.
NEUT34|"I want to teach them so that they get the opportunity to."""
