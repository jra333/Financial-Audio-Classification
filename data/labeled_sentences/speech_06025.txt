BULL0|"""So let's put our Dagmar map to work, coaxing customers up the ladder to loyalty is what we're all about, and Dagmar is the best map we have."
NEUT1|Dagmar shows us the steps.
NEUT2|Dagmar helps us to set objectives.
NEUT3|Dagmar helps us to formulate our coffee strategy at the top of the Dagmar ladder.
NEUT4|See it's brand loyalty, and at the bottom sits mere category need.
NEUT5|Let's call it a state of brand ignorance or objective, as marketers is always to move customers up the ladder to loyalty and keep them there.
NEUT6|How might that work out in practice?
NEUT7|Say setting objectives for Coca Cola.
NEUT8|Our goal is of course 100% customer loyalty that may take a bit of doing even for Coca Cola.
NEUT9|So first we need to know where Coke customers sit right now.
NEUT10|Going to have to do a bit of guessing.
NEUT11|We don't have access to codes research data, but we'll guess that Coke has a very low category.
NEUT12|Need.
NEUT13|Can't be many people who know there's a Cola category out there but haven't heard of code, so we put a low 2% down there for category and 3% for low level brand awareness.
NEUT14|Most folk know plenty about code put in 5% to a brand knowledge, but no attitude.
NEUT15|And 10% relative brand attitude and say 5% have the intention of buying Coke but don't do so.
NEUT16|Facilitation of purchase isn't an issue of a Coca Cola.
NEUT17|You find that drink everywhere, so we'll jump to actual purchase.
NEUT18|Consumers who purchase but don't get up to the next rung of satisfaction satisfaction.
NEUT19|I put in an arbitrary 55%.
NEUT20|So what do we put in for loyalty?
BULL21|15% could be OK.
NEUT22|Remember, this is just an exercise in setting objectives.
NEUT23|If we will manage in cope, we'd know this stuff for real now.
NEUT24|So let's set our specific and measurable objectives for each run.
BULL25|Tops going up.
NEUT26|So something must go down below to make Room 2 to 1%, Category 3 to 2% brand awareness 5 down to 4% for knowledge.
BULL27|As a few drops 10 percent 20% purchase intention 5 to 3% brand purchase without satisfaction 5% to 3% and satisfaction goes up from 55% to 59% and loyalty 15 to 20% in a year.
NEUT28|We'll do new research and see if we achieved our objectives.
NEUT29|Simples.
NEUT30|What benefits are we going to communicate?
NEUT31|Co copy strategy?
NEUT32|There are clues everywhere in its advertising.
NEUT33|Try Coca Cola copy will convince all soft drink consumers that only Coca Cola offers.
NEUT34|The benefits and lasting values unique to the brand.
NEUT35|Refreshment, hapiness, belonging and the appreciation of friends.
BULL36|OK, I made it up but it will do and most importantly it will do for those on every rung of the ladder.
NEUT37|But suppose we have a short term objective Reebok Classics for example wants to up its brand purchase figure only 10% by when intention is a massive 55%.
NEUT38|Let's turn that around.
NEUT39|And get those who intend to purchase.
BULL40|To do so, let's get purchase up from 10% to 55%.
NEUT41|Now.
NEUT42|What effect has that on our copy strategy where this price and place fit in the coffee strategy?
NEUT43|Answers in the next class?
