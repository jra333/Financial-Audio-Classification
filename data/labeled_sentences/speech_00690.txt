BEAR0|"""The major stock market averages maybe down more than 1% each year."
NEUT1|To kick off the new year, but not the electric car makers Tesla and Nio?
BULL2|Nope, they are rising above the sell off today.
BULL3|Anne rallying on some pretty impressive delivery numbers.
NEUT4|Yahoo Finance's Emily McCormick has been following this one for us.
NEUT5|She joins us now, Emily.
BULL6|Well, Alexis taking a look here at both Neil and Tesla really handily beating their previous records when it comes to their December 4th quarter as well as their annual deliveries.
NEUT7|And I'll start off with Neo here because we really are seeing this stock pop in the intraday session.
BULL8|Really bucking the trend here of the broader market and those American depositary receipts up 9% intraday.
NEUT9|Now taking a look here at Neos deliveries for December.
BULL10|Those coming in at 7007 that was an increase of 121% over last year and this brought total deliveries.
BULL11|In 2020, to 43,728 that was a jump of 113% year over year.
BULL12|Now I also want to highlight that Neil isn't the only a Chinese based a car company in electric vehicle company specifically that has been topping expectations recently.
BULL13|We also saw X Peng as well as Lee Auto handily topped Wall Street's expectations when it came to their delivery results as well for December.
NEUT14|So really, a testament here to the demand story that exists in China, which as we know.
NEUT15|Is the largest market here for electric vehicle companies now taking a look here at Tesla that company delivering a total of 400 and 99,550 vehicles for the full year?
BEAR16|That was just really trivially short of the half a million vehicles that Wall Street had really been homing in on up again.
BEAR17|Really amounts to a rounding error here.
BULL18|Still up 36% year over year from be about 300 and 67,500 added, reported last year.
NEUT19|And of these, more than 180,000 occur during the fourth quarter alone.
BULL20|So again, a really strong finish here for Tesla and really speaks to the momentum that this company in particular is heading into the new year with after a more than 700% stock gain that we saw in 2020 Alexis.
NEUT21|I want to get back to Neo for a minute because I also know they launched their own used car service and also a trading platform.
NEUT22|What can you tell us about that?
NEUT23|That's right, Alexa.
NEUT24|So some of these stock gains that we are seeing for NEO today.
NEUT25|Coming on the heels of this announcement as well, which came out yesterday.
NEUT26|Neil, essentially saying that it plans to invest the equivalent of more than $450 million into this service over the next five years.
NEUT27|That service, of course, being that knew you scarred platform.
BULL28|So really, Neo is doubling down here, really trying to capitalize on this demand that we're seeing in the electric vehicle market.
NEUT29|An if we think about what meal has been doing over the past couple of months.
NEUT30|And it also really been.
BULL31|Rolling out a liquidity injection that we saw over the summer.
NEUT32|It had a battery subscription program that had just announced in the past couple of months and said that it does plan to expand into Europe as well.
NEUT33|And remember that Tesla is also building out its giga factory near Berlin, so clearly we are seeing these electric vehicle makers in the early innings of this EV revolution.
NEUT34|Really trying to make this a land grab and take up as much market share as they can.
BULL35|Again in these early stages.
NEUT36|So I think that really speaks to what we saw here in Neo's latest delivery figures as well as in these latest announcements in new services.
BULL37|Alexis made nice start to the year for those EV related companies.
NEUT38|Emily McCormack.
BULL39|"Thank you."""
