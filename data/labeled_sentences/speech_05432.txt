NEUT0|"""Hey guys this is andrewjoiningsensors.com so I've been working as a professional trainer for the past six years in Hong Kong an I'm doing right now."
NEUT1|Some YouTube videos for around three months.
NEUT2|Because guys I want to show you how pro traders are working the different tools and techniques that we use, at least those that work for me.
NEUT3|So if you want to know about all this stuff and if you want to know how we actually make money on the markets you are in the right place.
BULL4|So today I wanna make another license on the oil market because the old market is actually a very good indicator for the equity market.
NEUT5|Let's get into it.
NEUT6|So this is the oil market for the past 10 years.
NEUT7|The trend looks bearish definitely, but something very interesting is happening here, yes?
NEUT8|So this is when the oil.
BEAR9|So this is the covid crisis.
BEAR10|Of course the old was trending negatively and since then we have a rebound.
NEUT11|We are trading above the 200.
NEUT12|Moving average on the weekly time frame which is bullish.
BEAR13|But we are confronted to a major resistance.
NEUT14|I don't know if you guys spotted it.
NEUT15|To me, it's kind of obvious address, you know, connect the highs that I had during the past ten years on the weekly time frame and you can see that it's working pretty well.
NEUT16|123 almost four and you can see that this is actually the level where we had.
NEUT17|So let me go to a daily timeframe 63.
BEAR18|This is the level where we got rejected guys we got rejected here and we lost 5%.
NEUT19|How funny, how funny that a 10 year trend is giving you that precise signals.
NEUT20|This one is obvious and everybody saw it and every old trader had some profit taking at 6263 guys because they are professionals and they know how the market is behaving and if everybody makes the same thing it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.
NEUT21|And this is exactly exactly what happened here.
NEUT22|We are still trading above the moving averages so this move is to me.
NEUT23|Intact and we're actually checking if we're going to have a breakout right away.
NEUT24|Once again, guys added a video.
NEUT25|Very interesting.
NEUT26|I think for you to watch on the NASDAQ bubble that is happening right now and on the S&P 500 bubble.
NEUT27|That is not happening yet, but happening sooner.
NEUT28|This is my view and I was saying that you need to follow the oil, the dxy, the 10 year yield as indicators, and to show you if yes or not the bubble is happening.
NEUT29|So yes, if we have a breakout here.
BULL30|This means that we are in a situation where this bubble is likely to happen, and this is confirming my scenario that the equity market is going to take maybe 100% in one year.
NEUT31|So I'm going to be very careful on this one and I'm going to use it to actually build my views on the equity market.
NEUT32|So for now we are bullish, but we didn't have the breakout yet, so keep an eye on this one.
NEUT33|That's it for me.
BULL34|I hope you guys enjoyed this video.
BULL35|I hope this is gonna help you too.
