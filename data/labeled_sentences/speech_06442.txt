BULL0|"""Welcome back everybody."
NEUT1|Economists have been weighing in over the weekend on the chance of New Mexican tariffs and the Fed funds markets reacting over the weekend and this morning to senior economics.
NEUT2|Reporter Steve Liesman is here to join us with the latest What's happening?
BEAR3|Yeah, not pretty fed funds, fed funds markets reacting dramatically to the chance of these new tariffs on Mexico and economists warning of possible recessions.
NEUT4|Take a look at these rate cut probabilities.
BULL5|We now are putting in a 57% chance of a cut in July.
NEUT6|That wasn't even on our board for the last several months when we started talking about cuts and now we're good darn sure it's going to happen sometime by the end of the year with 87% probability by September, 93% by October, and there's more to it, because not only are we counting on a single cut, there's a 64% probability by October.
NEUT7|Of two cuts.
BEAR8|Is this happening because we're worried about what you see in the Treasury markets right now?
NEUT9|Where you've got yields coming there?
NEUT10|So yeah, sure, hold on to that.
NEUT11|Hold on to that thought Becky.
BULL12|Brilliant as always, but jumping the gun here, the move in these markets is equal to the strong concerns expressed over the weekend in the economic reports, Pantheon says the chance of a self inflicted unnecessary weakening in the economy this year and perhaps even a recession has increased markedly.
BULL13|Barclays writes, we now expect global economic and financial conditions to worsen enough to warrant 75 basis points in rate cuts from the Fed this year beginning in.
BULL14|Q3 JP Morgan says making abysmal growth attainable.
NEUT15|That's the title of their report.
BULL16|If the administration follows through on the proposed actions, we believe the adverse growth implications would prompt Fed easing.
NEUT17|And now Becky was asking what's happening at Treasury market.
NEUT18|So here's their ten year, three months now at a 26 basis point inversion and a lot of that happening since Friday.
NEUT19|Also, a lot of talk about how currencies are going to react to this.
BEAR20|The Mexican peso devalued against the dollar possibility out there that the Chinese use the their currency as a weapon.
NEUT21|I would report the other side of this but there is none.
NEUT22|I do not have an economic report from the president's office about the positive implications of the tariffs.
NEUT23|As far as I know they haven't studied it.
NEUT24|Maybe Kevin will tell you if he's got a report on this because he did want socialism.
NEUT25|"So maybe someone tariffs."""
