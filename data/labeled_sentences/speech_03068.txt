NEUT0|"""Here is clean this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, a nice day here for Facebook, you know yesterday was a crazy day in the sense of big gap up.
NEUT5|Price came down so it was a very real question of, you know, it was this movement here was this the beginning of the end, you know, is the are the wheels really bout to fall off and no price got the gap up now.
BULL6|Sure it did pull back a little bit from the highs but again, relatively speaking from how things were looking.
NEUT7|On Monday to how they behave today.
NEUT8|Nice movement here and also a couple of very interesting levels have making themselves or made themselves apparent here.
NEUT9|From the trading standpoint and the first ever hear that a lot of people are going to be watching is that 269 fifty mark?
NEUT10|If you go through the history of the chart you can see Price bounced from it, their bonds from it there, so by no means am I saying this is a guarantee.
NEUT11|But my point here is, it's a more than valid.
NEUT12|It's a more than rational thoughts.
BEAR13|Have that if the price were to come down there and then breakdown below that level, that could very well create quite a bit of downside selling pressure again.
NEUT14|I guarantee absolutely not a rational thought of valid thought.
NEUT15|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT16|So keep a very close eye on the two 6950 Mark.
NEUT17|If that level can not quite hold up, then yeah, it wouldn't be shocking.
NEUT18|At least in my opinion, to see the price go down to the 266 level, which is that green line right there with that next level of support.
NEUT19|Now the flip side of things.
NEUT20|Maybe the price just decides it wants to work its way back upwards so the other area that a whole lot of people are going to watch, especially those breakout players.
NEUT21|Is going to be right here at the 274 mark.
NEUT22|I mean you look at time after time.
BULL23|Today the price try to get up to that level.
NEUT24|Couldn't quite do it.
NEUT25|So again this is not a guarantee, but a more than valid thought.
NEUT26|To have that if the price works the way up there gets the break of that level.
BEAR27|That could very well create quite a bit of upside buying pressure.
NEUT28|So keep trying those couple of technical levels going forward and those would be the areas that you know.
NEUT29|I think that most people will be watching and again a lot of people are watching those same levels and wondering the same thing.
NEUT30|They can definitely produce some very nice price movement and you know we'll see what happens with that.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird.
NEUT36|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT37|But in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT41|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
