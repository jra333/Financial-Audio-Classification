NEUT0|"""Alright, let's talk bonds."
NEUT1|Let's talk inflation.
BULL2|Inflation might be easing back a little bit.
BULL3|Is that going to help?
NEUT4|the Fed is going to give a little room to maneuver.
NEUT5|Matt Phillips is here to discuss this one.
NEUT6|Mr. Phillips.
BULL7|Good morning to you, how are you doing?
NEUT8|Well, back from your big trip across America, we missed you a couple of weeks, so you should see.
NEUT9|America is beautiful.
NEUT10|I listen, I've done the cross country thing.
NEUT11|My friends been there before.
NEUT12|I've been on the road you frightened in school in high school when I was out to dinner with Carol acting.
NEUT13|No, but seriously.
NEUT14|All right, let's talk about the Fed.
NEUT15|Let's talk about inflation.
BULL16|Is inflation coming down enough that it's actually going to give the Fed some maneuvering room here?
NEUT17|Big story.
NEUT18|This beautiful story.
NEUT19|The graphics in the picture.
NEUT20|Matt Phillips.
NEUT21|Something of beauty.
NEUT22|Well, tell me what's going on.
NEUT23|It's not so much inflation right?
NEUT24|Which is kind of a backward looking measure.
NEUT25|You can look at CPI.
BULL26|CPI is actually up.
NEUT27|We had our most recent reading in April.
BULL28|It was up about 2.3% S hot.
BEAR29|Sounds a little hot, but it's been that's the lowest year to year increase for quite awhile, so people aren't really worried.
NEUT30|That much about inflation, and that what that how that's transferring in the financial markets is through some things that look at inflation expectations.
NEUT31|So going forward, one of the things you can do is you can look at the difference in the yield between the plain vanilla Treasury note and something called tip, which is the Treasury inflation protected security.
NEUT32|So basically that differential gives you a reading on about what people see inflation doing over the next narrowing.
BEAR33|It has been narrowing for awhile, so it was about 2.4% back in March.
NEUT34|Now it's come down to about 2.
NEUT35|2.13 or something.
NEUT36|So what that saying is that going forward, people see the average inflation rate over the next 10 years, roughly coming in about 2.1%.
NEUT37|That is not going to be.
BULL38|Basically that opens the door a little bit more to the Fed if they want to do something because the big concern when the Fed has done stuff in the past like quantitative easing is we've seen inflation metrics go a lot higher.
NEUT39|We saw it remember gold prices going crazy.
NEUT40|Now I gotta tell you that doesn't that doesn't sound so good to me.
NEUT41|'cause I know we know the Fed doesn't have an official inflation band.
NEUT42|But we know they have an informal band, right?
BEAR43|But it was between 1.5 and 2%.
BEAR44|Yeah, we'll see inflation in that bad.
NEUT45|Yeah, roughly 2%.
NEUT46|So what you're telling me is that it's at the high end of that, if not a little bit over it.
NEUT47|How does that actually gives the Fed more room to maneuver?
NEUT48|It's going in the right direction.
NEUT49|There's a thing, so it is coming down and it's not saying that the door is wide open, but it's definitely moving towards the direction the Fed has has shown when we hit this like 2% area that seems to be when the feds more comfortable about doing stuff.
NEUT50|So we saw that.
NEUT51|And when we talk about what they're going to do is we're running out of time.
NEUT52|So you can read the whole story.
NEUT53|What are we talking about them doing?
NEUT54|Well, I mean the question is that are they going to do another QE program where they create money and buy bonds?
NEUT55|Are they going to extend their operation Twist program which actually wouldn't create money and therefore wouldn't be seen as as inflationary inflationary at also.
NEUT56|If things they've signaled that they're they're interested in doing something.
BEAR57|"If Europe gets a lot worse than the economies are still."""
