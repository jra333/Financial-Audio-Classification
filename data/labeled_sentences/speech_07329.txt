NEUT0|"""John, I think their target was like 60 to 90 million Subs over three to five years."
NEUT1|Correct me if I'm wrong, they hit that Mark pretty quickly.
NEUT2|I mean, a lot of course having to do with the pandemic as well, but how impressed are you by those Disney plus numbers?
NEUT3|Yeah, Disney Plus is fantastic like like you said 60 to 90 million by 2024.
NEUT4|They did 74 million in the first year.
BULL5|So yeah, that has been one of the one of the bright spots for sure and frankly not just at Disney and within the whole streaming universe.
BULL6|And I think that it beat everybody's numbers.
NEUT7|Is it making any money though?
BEAR8|I would say it's losing less money than we expected.
NEUT9|Now that said, one thing I think that management made clear is that the.
NEUT10|Investments have just begun this this this platform is going to be a global phenomenon is already going for now, but take it to the next level.
BULL11|There's going to be an increase in investment.
NEUT12|You lot more content on this platform.
BEAR13|Yeah, it's you know you're gonna lose money on every subscriber, but don't worry, you'll make it up in volume.
NEUT14|Listen here.
NEUT15|Here's the good news and bad news.
NEUT16|I see it for Disney John.
BULL17|The good news is they got a lot of subscribers, their highly touting their one big program, the Mandalorian and the second season coming out.
NEUT18|But I would imagine, aside from their old catalog, they don't have a lot of new offerings because you haven't been able to film anything new since March.
NEUT19|Where do you think the sort of the lineup is going to be in the next three to six months?
NEUT20|'cause consumers care?
BEAR21|They'll drop you like that nowadays.
BULL22|That's right, there's very low switching costs to these new platforms.
NEUT23|It's not unlike cable where you know it's a very sticky product.
NEUT24|You have professional installation with the DC platforms.
NEUT25|You can turn them on, turn him off to almost on a daily basis, right?
NEUT26|So you're you're right.
BEAR27|And I do think you know that the growth in Disney Plus did slow a bit in the quarter.
NEUT28|And I do think that that's a function of the the programming, the content creation hiatus we saw from the pandemic.
BEAR29|That is still an issue and you're right over the next three to six months, especially as the new market launches slow, you could see the growth of the product slow even further.
NEUT30|Yeah, you know, listen to be fair.
NEUT31|We like to focus on Disney.
NEUT32|Plus it's new.
NEUT33|It's ****.
NEUT34|It's the bright shiny thing, but it's not really material to the company right now.
NEUT35|I mean, ESPN and the theme parks.
NEUT36|They are material theme parks.
BEAR37|All the lockdowns CEO slamming the Governor of California really.
BEAR38|For sort of these new restrictions as well, ESPN's been struggling with layoffs last couple of weeks.
NEUT39|How ESPN and the theme parks do in John?
NEUT40|Great question.
BULL41|So theme parks actually did a little better than we thought.
BEAR42|I mean, revenues were down like 60%.
BEAR43|We thought they'd be down 70.
BEAR44|They were down 85 so there were more people in the parks and we expected.
NEUT45|But the real.
BEAR46|Free, there's on the cost side, as you heard with all the layoffs were doing a who's being very aggressive in in, in, in managing that side of the business, so the losses were quite a bit better than we thought we were looking for.
NEUT47|Closer to 2 billion was only about 1 billion in law.
NEUT48|Just an ESPN was actually a bright spot.
BULL49|Their median net business actually grew.
NEUT50|Operating income on your rear basis and that is really a function of the return of sports.
BULL51|While sports ratings weren't good as we thought, there were a lot of them.
BULL52|So advertising at ESPN was up over 20%.
NEUT53|It's going to be up again this this quarter, but a lot of it has to do with this within the schedule.
NEUT54|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT55|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
