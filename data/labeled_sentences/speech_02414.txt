NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|I'm like I'm stocked up in this video.
NEUT2|We're going to be analyzing a catalyst on Disney and how it's going to affect the stock this week.
NEUT3|So today is Sunday.
NEUT4|You know the market doesn't open and we could see on cnbc.com one of the biggest headlines on there is Avengers.
BULL5|Endgame dominates the box office with 90% of US ticket sales.
NEUT6|So Disney owns The Avengers end game and you know this is only for Disney stock and we could just see some key points from this article.
BULL7|That 90% of ticket sales they got, they made history and brought in $350 million during its debut.
BEAR8|No other film showing at the box office during the same time mean more than 10 million.
BULL9|So it made history records to record ticket sales brought in 350,000,000.
NEUT10|Got 90% of ticket sales, you know?
BULL11|And they even beat their own previous records with Age of Ultron, Infinity War.
BEAR12|So they are just crushing records.
NEUT13|That's a great thing, right?
NEUT14|So if we had over to the chart?
BULL15|You know, we could see that if we go to a daily chart we can see Disney had a great earnings release and then you know they've been uptrending these past couple days.
BULL16|Now Disney on a short term scale is up quite a lot.
NEUT17|In the past couple days.
NEUT18|You know Disney went from, you know you could say $133 olive to $139.
NEUT19|I mean, it's like 2% on Friday.
NEUT20|So Disney has been moving a lot, but with this amazing news article.
NEUT21|Let's see with this amazing news article, I wouldn't be surprised if Disney spikes up a lot in premarket tomorrow morning, or if it's extremely volatile because, you know, there's a great great news article, you know it's literally showing that they're beating all records and they brought in $350 million for this film.
BULL22|So like I said, it's a great, great catalyst.
NEUT23|How you can make money from it is, you know you could.
NEUT24|Obviously by the stock or you know, if you see that the stocks falling like let's say Disney starts falling in premarket right, you know that they just hit record ticket sales, so just 'cause it's falling doesn't mean the fact is we go down like you could buy down there as support, like right here.
BEAR25|Let's say, let's say Disney falls to $137 in premarket tomorrow.
NEUT26|You can see it.
BULL27|There's a support level right here from this previous day.
NEUT28|Let's see, you can see if there's a previous support level right here from right over here on.
NEUT29|The 25th, so if Disney falls down there in premarket, which is not likely, but if it does.
BULL30|It's worth the risk because you know they hit record ticket sales and you know great things are going for the company.
NEUT31|Another way, like let's say Disney shoots up in premarket just by you know 142 one 43144 out of the money call options there gonna be kinda cheap But The thing is if Disney shoots up, those calls are also going to fly up.
NEUT32|You could sell puts you can sell put spreads so just not Disney's gonna be at least pretty volatile.
NEUT33|It should shoot up so keep it on your watch list for Monday morning.
NEUT34|Give any questions on this video.
NEUT35|Let me know in the comments down below bothering that.
BULL36|"Thanks for watching."""
