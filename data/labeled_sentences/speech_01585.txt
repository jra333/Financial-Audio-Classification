NEUT0|"""Welcome back is the 6th of July, 2020."
NEUT1|Monday, the first day of the week.
NEUT2|So we have just done Bitcoin Ethereum SRP between cash color no, because Litecoin, crypto.com coin and now going to Binance coin coming in at #10, move the ticker B&B for BMP again we see nothing much has been happening.
NEUT3|If you seem like we're forming a another mountain range over here right?
NEUT4|This is really a very gigantic mountain range.
NEUT5|I think this is really a head and shoulders here and we actually have two targets.
NEUT6|One is at.
NEUT7|0.014 * 2 is 0.01 right now we are at zero point 0.017, so from the current price levels, two target number one is another 18% ago while I try.
NEUT8|Don't know we're going to go if you're going to drop that low, but if you see me like we already forming a mountain range.
NEUT9|Yes.
NEUT10|Yeah, this is really a mountain one.
NEUT11|Are we going to get Mountain two and then we drop?
NEUT12|Yes, Nope.
NEUT13|We're not entirely sure we're absolutely not entirely sure.
NEUT14|All I know is that I wish you have targets Twister downside, but that doesn't mean we are going to drop.
BULL15|But yeah, I'm still bearish to be honest.
BEAR16|I'm still very bearish for Binance coin again because Biden has yet to experience a true full on bear season.
BEAR17|I think this is already the bear season ever since breaking the skinny pink line for good way back in August 2019.
BEAR18|Binance coin has been in a.
NEUT19|Fair, so will this bear be ending soon or will be hitting our targets first before we see any recovery for B&B?
NEUT20|Yes, yeah at least one time you're still not entirely sure, so you know we're still bearish bias bear, but my point is that we're still not entirely sure whether if we're going to see any recovery or not, but the rally that is, you know, I'm seeing right now the rally that I'm seeing right now is not exactly that strong, and I'm expecting more downside to go for PNP.
NEUT21|Alright Tyler is we want to be against USD T but before that please video like enjoyed it.
NEUT22|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think might be in the comments below for baby against USD.
NEUT23|Yeah this is like a mountain range in South Mountain One mountain two or doing the scene mounted three complete an in pump.
BEAR24|We could be dropping lower for PNB against USD T so yeah by another ticket system.
NEUT25|We are very close to the skinny play so we might just break this skinny pink line but I don't see any bullish development and so I am.
NEUT26|I'm continuing continuing my.
NEUT27|Bearish bias to Wister.
NEUT28|Downside is just that for BNB against USD T things are not as clear against BTC.
NEUT29|BTC is much more clearer and we have targets for BTC for USD, not so much.
NEUT30|So yeah, be very careful about going to trade too soon.
BEAR31|If Binance does drop here.
BEAR32|Oh God today is not gonna be good.
NEUT33|This is going to be more than one month until we get a mountain tree and we could be.
NEUT34|Collapsing even further, so be very, very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT35|Alright, I guess it's from my Binance coin technical analysis.
BULL36|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL37|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT38|"I shall see you in the next video."""
