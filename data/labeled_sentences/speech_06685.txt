BEAR4|Also, the Tenkan Sen Kijun Sen Lines are negatively aligned.
BEAR5|Our size fallen below 50, so these are bear signals.
BEAR6|The 200 day moving average now is acting as an immediate barrier to the upside, and this comes in around one point.
BEAR7|11:06 there is scope for prices to fall to 1.0807 and this would be the July 20 low.
BULL8|A break below this level would pave the way for a test of the multi year low of 1.04.

NEUT10|If we look at the bigger picture.
BULL11|We could see that the market is still in a corrective pattern.
