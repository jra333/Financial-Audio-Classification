NEUT0|"""I'm looking in the webcam."
NEUT1|Let's do this.
NEUT2|This is being shot with the new MacBook Airs webcam.
NEUT3|This is being shot with my 10 year old MacBook Pro and this is the Surface laptop three and the Google Pixelbook go and the Dell XPS 13, and this is my iPhone 11 front facing camera.
NEUT4|I think you get the point.
NEUT5|Laptop webcams sorta **** which is why I'm trying to shoot most of this video using the MacBook Airs webcam will get that including these beauty shots.
NEUT6|It is very hard to shoot a video with a laptop webcam.
NEUT7|Very hard why the MacBook Air?
NEUT8|Well, I started reviewing this new model which has a great new keyboard and $999 price right when the world was forced to communicate via video chatting because coronavirus and then it hit me.
NEUT9|This thing has an out dated 720P webcam while other laptops like the pixel book go can do Full HD.
NEUT10|Besides, my iPhone 11 has a 4K selfie camera, so I decided to test all these laptops and my iPhone.
NEUT11|In a few different conditions, test 1 great lighting conditions on a nice partly cloudy day AKA nature softbox.
BULL12|All the webcams did a solid job of basic balance and color.
NEUT13|OK, maybe not the Dell XPS 13.
NEUT14|Heck, even my old MacBook Pros 480P Cam looks better yet you can see that the MacBook Airs Cam is much grainier than the Google Pixelbook goes.
NEUT15|Crisp camera an well you compare to the iPhone.
NEUT16|Which actually picked up this thing in my tooth that I had no idea was there test you.
NEUT17|Backlight we all know this difficult webcam shot big window in the back of you makes you look like a ghost or Angel.
NEUT18|The air actually didn't do.
BEAR19|Too bad adjusting to the lightning.
BEAR20|It gets real bad there.
BULL21|But whoop, though the Pixelbook was again sharper and not as grainy waving test.
NEUT22|And oh boy, that day looks like garbage.
NEUT23|I truly look like an Angel.
NEUT24|Alright, and the iPhone.
BULL25|Yeah, I mean I look good, look good as usual.
NEUT26|Test 3 low light.
BEAR27|Hello, don't worry, I'm wearing like 16 sweatshirts as you can see the MacBook Air quality is no good.
NEUT28|In fact, in low light I'd prefer my 10 year old Mac book Pro actually.
NEUT29|Doesn't look horrible and goof Dell again.
BULL30|Dell said the camera in the new XPS 13 is the smallest ever in a laptop and it's always looking at technologies to improve performance.
BULL31|The Pixelbook did a decent job, but not as good as the surface laptop and the quality is much better than well.
NEUT32|Of course the pretty much not even worth comparing this to any of the other webcams goodnight.
NEUT33|So what do we learn from all this?
NEUT34|Well, unless you've got a Pixelbook go your laptops webcam probably ***** and none of them are as good as those selfie cameras on our smartphones.
NEUT35|Why?
NEUT36|Well, for one thing, we don't go around taking photos with our laptops.
NEUT37|That's a cute photo.
NEUT38|Plus, laptop screens are always much thinner than the thinnest phones.
NEUT39|Sure, you could always buy an external webcam or just use your phone, but I think we can all agree it's about time that Apple put a decent camera.
NEUT40|On its otherwise almost perfect MacBook Air.
NEUT41|"Hollywood here I come."""
