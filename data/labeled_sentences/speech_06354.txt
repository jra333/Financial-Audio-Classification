NEUT0|"""Welcome to Trading Nation on Brian Sullivan today."
NEUT1|Let's take a look at stocks that are trading in extended territory that is trading double digits above their 200 day moving averages.
NEUT2|Those names include Netflix, Boeing, Wynn Resorts, an NVIDIA, among others.
NEUT3|Any of these gone too far, too fast, or they still a good deal for your investments.
BULL4|Mike Binger with gradient investments and Craig Johnson, with Piper Jaffray, I mean Craig, I pointed out actually that recently there's already 10 stocks that are more than 20% up.
BULL5|In the S&P 500 in 2018, so a lot of stocks are well above moving averages.
BULL6|These stocks double digits above their 200 day moving averages.
NEUT7|Does any of them look like it still has more juice left in the tank?
BEAR8|Well, Brian, that's one of my chief concerns about this entire market right now, and again, you know that we've been very bullish on this tape.
BULL9|We got a little bit of a tactical kind of pullback opportunity.
BEAR10|I think that's coming because so many of these stocks are extended.
NEUT11|And from my perspective, just looking at the Dow, nearly 20% of the Dow or 20% of the weight, I should say of the Dow is well extended above an almost parabolic looking chart.
NEUT12|So that's a cautionary thing in terms of the names we mentioned here, Wynn Resorts would be the one if I had to buy.
NEUT13|Any of these stocks?
NEUT14|Again, I don't like buying parabolic stocks, but that would be the one because I still am not back at all time.
BULL15|New highs.
BULL16|I still have more than 50 points that I could go before I could go back to the old highs and I am seeing some relative strength supporting a further move higher here from these levels.
NEUT17|But again this is a market for me to be taking profits, not putting fresh money back to work.
NEUT18|Brian.
NEUT19|OK now putting fresh money back to work Mike, you're more of a value guy.
BEAR20|I mean these stocks have been hot.
NEUT21|I hope you've owned some of them for your clients.
NEUT22|Would you own any of them now?
NEUT23|I would frankly not own any one of the four that you just listed off at this current time.
NEUT24|We've owned him in the past.
NEUT25|I just think there are two extended.
NEUT26|There are two parabolica of price movements, but I do think that you can own similar companies that have the same growth profiles that much better valuations.
NEUT27|For example, we would we would own and we do own Las Vegas stands sands instead of Wynn Resorts.
BULL28|We own JTX who just had a great quarter the other day.
NEUT29|Instead of bowing an we own Facebook.
NEUT30|Google instead of owning Netflix there they have the same growth rates, much cheaper valuations, and they actually generate cash versus burn it.
NEUT31|So right now I went on any of those things and as far as NVIDIA goes, I think there's way too much hype there.
NEUT32|As far as crypto mining, currency, artificial intelligence and automated driving to buy NVIDIA up here, I think you're just playing with fire, but you kind of recommended Las Vegas Sands on the slide for you.
NEUT33|Did you not, Mike?
NEUT34|I I kind of recommended Las Vegas Sands and I kind of record recommended United Technologies and Facebook and Google too.
NEUT35|Alright, well there you go.
NEUT36|We got names you don't like and a couple of names that you do.
NEUT37|Mike and Craig.
