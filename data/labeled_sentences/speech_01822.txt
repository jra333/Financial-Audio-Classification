NEUT0|"""Hey fools and welcome I'm Jill Ralph here with Stuart Watson, Roger hi Stuart and we're here to talk about a very popular theme and investing."
NEUT1|Dividend stocks full 97 of the 100 Footsie 100 stocks pay a dividend but not all is created equal when it comes to dividend stocks.
NEUT2|So we're going to give you 3 warning signs when you're looking at dividend stocks, so I'm going to jump right in.
BEAR3|A warning sign #1A company with an inconsistent track record of paying the dividend.
NEUT4|So Stuart it sounds pretty intuitive, but tell us why is that a problem for for a company or a dividend investor?
BULL5|Yeah, I mean most companies will try and increase their dividends steadily each year, so just maybe add sort of five 6% because generally that's what big investors like to see.
BULL6|I like to see a steadily increased dividend year on year.
NEUT7|There's not actually that many companies that can boast that sort of record.
NEUT8|So we picked out a few.
NEUT9|This is for example Tesco Articules TCO.
NEUT10|Pyside cousins, peas, Edsi and Greg sandwiches Giorgi.
NEUT11|These are all got great track records of over 20 years of paying increasing dividends, but there's very few companies that position so when you look back over a company's dividend history, you see cuts or maybe it's past its dividend altogether.
BULL12|You know that can indicate it hasn't got a great track record over the long term, so that's a good sign to look out for if you want to avoid those dodgy dividend payers.
NEUT13|So warning sign one look for consistency in a dividend payment.
BEAR14|Warning sign #2 low dividend cover.
NEUT15|So we're going to talk through what does that actually mean?
NEUT16|So a low dividend cover is when basically the dividend is not that well covered by profits.
NEUT17|So saying company earns 100,000,000 in profits in one year and pays out 80 million in dividends.
NEUT18|That's quite a low dividend cover, so a good example there at the moment is Man Group, particularly EMG, and that's actually paying out more in dividends in the moment that it's actually earning profits.
NEUT19|Warning sign number two.
BULL20|Yeah, that's a big warning sign in each year it says will pay this level of dividend and it keeps on sort of.
NEUT21|Prolonging the agony almost, but that's it.
NEUT22|Can't go on forever, so you're a little nervous about that one.
NEUT23|A little bit.
NEUT24|Yeah, alright, so warning sign #3.
NEUT25|High yield dividend investors like to chase yield it can workout, but sometimes it can be risky.
NEUT26|So talk us through.
NEUT27|Why is chasing a high yielding dividend paying stock risky?
NEUT28|Yeah, I mean we like high yields, but the danger is too high yield so a lot of people will look at the average paid by the market, which is about three and a half.
NEUT29|4% of the moment and they will say.
NEUT30|Anything 50% more than that or higher, so say 6% or more.
BEAR31|That's too high, and that's a bit of a danger sign.
NEUT32|So a company that falls into that at the moment is Aviva.
NEUT33|Ticket is a VDOT shopping is paying about 7% at the moment.
BEAR34|Quite often you get these high yields, not because the dividends are going up, but the price is falling.
NEUT35|So you need to watch out there, so if it's if it's too high, then that's a big warning sign number.
NEUT36|So great, so there you have it.
BEAR37|Three warning signs, a couple.
NEUT38|Couple of companies that have stored a little nervous, including Man Group and Aviva, but then a couple companies that don't and then have a nice consistent track record of paying their dividend.
NEUT39|Tesco, PZ Cussons and Greg's.
NEUT40|So that was our dividend warning special for today.
BULL41|Hope you enjoyed it.
BULL42|"Thank you, Stuart."""
