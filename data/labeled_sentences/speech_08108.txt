NEUT0|"""An it is our last stick of the day and that is Amazon."
NEUT1|Jeff Bezos is selling even more Amazon stock, the CEO selling $990 million worth of the E Commerce giant's shares last Thursday an Friday, according to new filings with the SEC.
NEUT2|Now this comes after he sold $1.8 billion worth of stock earlier last week.
NEUT3|This means Bezos has sold in all $2.8 billion worth of stock.
NEUT4|Then Annezin Jerrod back with me.
NEUT5|To weigh in Jerrod, there's a lot of speculation about why Bezos is selling this many shares.
NEUT6|Your thing, you said.
NEUT7|You said it.
NEUT8|He's probably raising capital for Blue Origin, which is a very expensive endeavour.
NEUT9|Besides the County Brevard in Florida, he's the only investor in the company.
NEUT10|And So what is he going to do with that?
NEUT11|Well, you don't have to disclose exactly what you're using the money for when you make these SEC filings, but 2.8 billion, a lot of money.
NEUT12|Last year he only sold about 33 million.
NEUT13|I think in the year before that, 2 billion.
NEUT14|But Morgan Stanley just came out and said this could be the year for space.
NEUT15|Pay attention to what's going on in that field and their head.
BULL16|They're having an investor conference circled around space, and I think this is a really long term investment here that has tremendous potential.
NEUT17|Final Frontier If you will.
NEUT18|And as I see you nodding your head with Jerrod, saying, this could be the year for space.
NEUT19|Yeah, that's right.
NEUT20|An really the only way that NASA can get back to the moon can go to Mars is really with the help of the private sector.
NEUT21|So what you're seeing is.
BULL22|"A lot of deals being made with NASA recently announced that it's teaming up with Blue Origin, with SpaceX with some other private companies for space projects."""
