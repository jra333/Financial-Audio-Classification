NEUT0|"""Some of the names they also like that community gym are the cruise lines which are all a little bit higher this morning."
BULL1|Macquarie does say Jim, we're upping to outperform as a sector.
BEAR2|They think that the next round of sailing suspensions.
BULL3|If we get it would be bookended by a more firm commitment to announcing new sailings.
NEUT4|At least in the US, as we ostensibly believe we're in some of the final chapters pending, you know, David and I have been talking Carl a lot about how this this new group of investors, when they're offered equity.
NEUT5|They take it, and yesterday Royal Caribbean offered 16 million shares at 91.
NEUT6|Anna lot of people David in the old style of what might have happened in the stock market.
NEUT7|At one point they say you know what real quick be now is the cash to be able to get through.
NEUT8|Let's buy Royal Caribbean right now.
NEUT9|What do you think about that as a way to invest well I'm not being facetious know I listen, my question would be what are their earnings per share going to look like?
NEUT10|How many shares have they?
NEUT11|You mean this dilution solution is going to be enormous, right?
BULL12|That's why you came stock is really rebounded dramatically from its lows.
NEUT13|It's not at its hot size, or closer to 111 somewhere in there, but you know we're not talking that far away.
BULL14|Jim, the share count has got.
NEUT15|I don't know.
NEUT16|I don't know what the numbers are.

NEUT19|What are they going to look like?
NEUT20|Well, do you finally do get back to actually having earnings?
NEUT21|This industry was very afflicted by having too many ships, so if row Caribbean does get back to where it was at 1:40, you have to question quarrel whether traditional analysis matters.
BEAR22|There were too many ships, so pricing was under pressure.
BULL23|Now we've got tremendous bargains.
NEUT24|I don't know you guys looked at some of the cruise prices, but they're fantastic, but they're not going to be making a lot of money initially.
NEUT25|And David is so right, Carl, these companies are serial issues.
NEUT26|Issuers of equity that used to matter and right now it does not matter to this newer group of buyers.
BULL27|It's impressive how much they like this group, but it's also a reminder that the analysts themselves to downgrade the hell item.
BULL28|Yeah well all three are in the top five SNP gainers as of this morning.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
