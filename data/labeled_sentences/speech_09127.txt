NEUT0|"""I also asked Gates where he lands on the topic."
NEUT1|We talk about virtually every day on this program, Bitcoin and how he thinks about the crypto currency in the context of climate change.
NEUT2|Seeing as how Bitcoin takes enormous amounts of energy to digitally mine.
NEUT3|I don't own Bitcoin, I'm not short Bitcoin, you know, so I've taken a neutral view.
NEUT4|I do think you know moving money into a more digital form and getting transaction costs down.
NEUT5|That's something our the Gates Foundation does in developing countries, but there we do it so that you can reverse the transaction so you have total visibility of who's doing what.
NEUT6|So it's not about tax avoidance or illegal activity.
NEUT7|But you know, Bitcoin can go up and down, you know, just based on the mania or whatever the views are.
NEUT8|And I you know, I don't have a way of predicting how that will progress.
NEUT9|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT10|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
