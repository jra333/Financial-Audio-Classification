BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|I'm gonna be doing some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency anchor, which is a MCR against ever US based on finance, prices and just update my last TI a video from a couple days back.
NEUT2|So a couple of things I want to talk about on this one is I had been kind of mentioning.
NEUT3|I wanted to see some sideways action and then some potential curl back up off of like this.
NEUT4|You know $0.15 support level.
NEUT5|I wanted to kind of see it start to hold this level with this daily candle closing in about 35 minutes.
NEUT6|There's definitely a couple of things I want to see happen moving forward.
NEUT7|So if we pull up like the four hour chart.
BEAR8|You can see this one kind of started to lose that like 15 Cent Mark Re tested it on the four hour.
BEAR9|So at this point I would like to see this level get recaptured before this daily candle close, but if not and it starts to have increasing red volume I could see this one potentially heading back to the mid to low thirteens, potentially even the high 12 sandmark, especially if it starts to lose this level.
NEUT10|So I would like to see a pretty strong daily close and even if it with how close it is right along this like.
NEUT11|Support level I wouldn't be surprised either to see it go a little bit more sideways or start to curl back up, but that's what you're going to want to watch for is you're going to want to see it bounce.
NEUT12|Either it before the end of this daily candle or on the next daily candle.
NEUT13|You're going to want to see this one start to balance and get some volume, because if not, this one is very likely, in my opinion, heading to that mid to low 13 cents, potentially even the high 12 cent range.
NEUT14|So I mean, if you draw like.
NEUT15|You can draw really this support at the bottom of this this week right here, so like it's still sitting like right around that support level, just regardless of where you're outlining it.
NEUT16|This one I need either needs to bounce and curl very shortly, or it's likely like I said, heading back down.
NEUT17|So some levels to watch for this, one to really get bullish again, in my opinion is a break of about $0.16 and then a break of a little bit over $0.17.
NEUT18|Those are kind of some of the levels I'd be watching just based off of some prior resistance levels on this one, which you can see right here and then.
NEUT19|You can also see right here.
NEUT20|So these are some of the levels I'd be watching and I'd want to see break on the daily chart for this one to really get bullish again.
NEUT21|The biggest spot is about that 19.1 cent level.
BULL22|A break of that's going to send this one back, you know, well above the 20s in my opinion.
NEUT23|But at the end of the day, right, this one needs to start to show some signs of life.
NEUT24|I mean, you could even argue that it's starting to put in.
BEAR25|A bit of this downtrend right here.
BULL26|Potentially right out support.
NEUT27|So you're going to want to see a break out in the next day or two, otherwise this ones going lower.
NEUT28|So this video is valuable to you at all.
