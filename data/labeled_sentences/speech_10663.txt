BEAR0|"""Let me go back to your point though, because if you meant made it many times, which is barring Chinese companies from being able to raise capital in the United States, that would be a dramatic action that would raise tensions."
NEUT1|To a very high extent, and that might actually reverberate in the stock market in a way that none of these other geopolitical moves seem to.
NEUT2|I agree with that.
NEUT3|I think that that's the one that says, alright, our doors closed like we closed the door to the to the Soviet Union mean other than arm and hammer going over there in the 20s to try to get the new economic policy out of Lennon, we basically stopped Commerce and this would be incredible to stop Commerce by shutting down that IPO.
NEUT4|And I have to tell you, I'm not.
NEUT5|I'm not advocating to shut down the IPO, but I do believe that they will say something.
NEUT6|I mean, they just I believe will be an IPO tweet or Navarro be on the tape and we will worry and that will cause.
BEAR7|On July 27th the market to go down, which is the date that I'm using to say that this short term rally might be over.
NEUT8|Thank you to lie Williams for giving me that one.
NEUT9|He's a known Chartist.
NEUT10|David July July 27th.
NEUT11|Yeah July 27 peak.
NEUT12|There you go.
NEUT13|That's 2:59 PM interesting.
NEUT14|Yeah, let's I've been using Larry Williams.
NEUT15|Is the Dean of of check the goal everywhere.
NEUT16|You know he's just a guy who's been around forever.
NEUT17|The percentage are Williams.
NEUT18|He's a great technician and he is called this rally nonstop and he says, be careful.
NEUT19|July 27.
NEUT20|So who am I to not say that all hell could break no no that you like 27 could be down there could be the start of a little bit getting over.
NEUT21|I mean we'll talk to our cash in later on this morning who's been looking at seasonality tored the end of July.
BEAR22|Generally not good.
NEUT23|I notice today not alliance.
NEUT24|Jim says corporate selling insider selling to buying 5 to one is the highest that we've seen only only two times this decade has that ratio been that high?
NEUT25|Is that, of course, inside of tires were they?
NEUT26|How much of that is Moderna?
BULL27|They gave you a good tell back in March?
NEUT28|The insider buyers called that right?
BEAR29|That's just it's a bad stat.
NEUT30|I mean, what can I say?
BEAR31|We got some bad stats we got after July, the markets week.
NEUT32|We've got the the possibility of a shot across the bow by shutting down a Chinese IPO, and we've got, you know, this is in the pipe.
NEUT33|So I'm, you know, just call me a little more circumspect.
NEUT34|I told the guys from who run the Chapel trust me, let's find something to sell.
NEUT35|"I want something sold today."""
