NEUT0|"""Brian Cornell was on squawk this morning, said a couple of interesting things."
BULL1|One was that he credits the quarter, not just a stimulus, but the shift in dollars away from travel and retail and Jim of course said something about how comps have held up in August.
NEUT2|Here's what he said.
BEAR3|May was the strongest month with comps over 30%, but in both June and July we saw comps in over 20% that strengths continued in August and we're seeing low to mid teen growth and the biggest adjustment is probably the consumer who is still waiting for a signal around back to school.
BULL4|So as you might imagine, uniforms and backpacks and school supplies are a little slower than last year, but the overall momentum and growth and market share continues as we go into the third quarter.
NEUT5|Alright, so so is that more optimistic than what McMillan said yesterday?
NEUT6|Yes, and what I find once again the self facing nature.
NEUT7|Brian Cornell.
NEUT8|I mean they took $5 billion in share.
NEUT9|Now you could argue they took it from the little guy.
NEUT10|That's a totally different discussion.
NEUT11|And it's a political discussion, some degree, but you need stimulus.
NEUT12|But what I liked about about Target was their extraordinary.
BULL13|Besides their digital comparable sales grew 195%.
NEUT14|This is shipped SHIPT and anyone who's used it is kind of amazed because in a lot of ways.
BULL15|It's superior to Amazon and Superior to Walmart.
NEUT16|No one who saw that coming 'cause the shipped acquisition wasn't that big.
NEUT17|Target has always been a favorite place for my generation.
NEUT18|It looks like it's another favorite place for the millennials.
NEUT19|It is extraordinary that Brian saw a good all this now he did again.
NEUT20|He said the backpack is not that good, but the fact is, he's having the best back to school on a relative basis.
BULL21|Which is why I think that stock continues to go higher.
BEAR22|What caused some stocks to decline yesterday in the segment?
NEUT23|Was back to school is a little sluggish and look I can pick on Kohl's because they didn't say it was little suckers.
BULL24|They just said it was bad but targets got the most momentum going into the holiday season and Brian has rebuilt another company.
NEUT25|I don't like clothes that had really fallen on hard times.
NEUT26|Target is now probably I would say one of the most fun places shop people get that I'm not denigrating with Doug Mcmillon's done but his targets work on ecommerce is extraordinary.
NEUT27|I remember when Brian first took that job.
NEUT28|He knew.
BEAR29|It was woeful.
BULL30|Had yeah the clothes Canada first very very tough decision.
NEUT31|They had to put a huge amount of money toward AECOM and he did it.
BULL32|It's paying off the stores.
NEUT33|By the way, are beautiful, more funding and remember one of the themes of this.
NEUT34|Is do you want to go to the stores?
NEUT35|Do you feel safe?
NEUT36|One of the reasons why Costco is up so much and they're not doing this reporting period as they've got wide aisles.
NEUT37|People feel safe there.
NEUT38|I think that target is another place that people feel very safe shopping and you can pick it up outside contact list.
NEUT39|Brian mentioned that.
BULL40|Just another great quarter.
NEUT41|It is hard if they remove so much to come in and say you know what, you can still buy target.
NEUT42|"But you can still buy target."""
