NEUT0|"""They spoke about the upcoming Spotify IPO and what you need to know is that a buy or is it a mess?"
NEUT1|Before I get started, don't forget to subscribe to grow your knowledge on investing and personal finance and had their bad luck on to stay one step ahead.
NEUT2|First, let's talk about what the heck Spotify actually is, but I'm sure most of you know already.
NEUT3|I remember back in the day.
NEUT4|Wish to buy these things called CD's used to have to go to shop like Target $18.00 and then you will get an album of about 12 songs.
NEUT5|No no no no no.
NEUT6|Thank God for modern technology and thank God for Spotify.
NEUT7|Spotify is predominantly a music streaming service.
NEUT8|It was developed in Stockholm, Sweden.
NEUT9|An is what's known as a freemium service.
NEUT10|It has basic features with advertisements for free and a more high quality product for those paid subscribers.
NEUT11|Some quick facts on this IPO.
NEUT12|First, it's going to be held in a different forum then a user IPO.
NEUT13|The IPO is not going to be a normal underwriting from Wall Street Bank.
NEUT14|Instead it's going to be sold directly to US investors.
NEUT15|On the New York Stock Exchange, it's expected to be sold around late March or April.
NEUT16|Also, Spotify is not going to sell all of this stock.
NEUT17|It's meant to be around $1 billion sold from a company supposedly worth around 20 billion.
NEUT18|OK, so is this IPO something we should be waiting for with bated breath and dollar signs in their eyes?
BEAR19|Or should we invest their money elsewhere to answer this question, we need to delve into the positives and negatives of buying into Spotify because I'm feeling a chipper.
NEUT20|Let's start with the positives.
NEUT21|First, they have 71 million paying subscribers.
NEUT22|This is 71 million.
BULL23|People have decided that they like the service enough that they're willing to pay up to $10 a month for their premium service sick, and they have an overall user base of 159 million users, which makes it the most popular music streaming service outpacing Apple and Google's competition so far.
BULL24|Largely, Spotify is a growing company, paid subscribers increased by 46% from last year's figures.
BEAR25|An active users are by 29%.
NEUT26|Having said all that, we must get into the negatives.
BEAR27|I have to start with the fact that Spotify are making negative profit.
BEAR28|They have a large net loss of $1.5 billion straight away.
BEAR29|This makes me want to my head and walk away from the company.
NEUT30|Generally I will only invest in companies that are making positive returns, but for small percentage of your portfolio it's OK to speculate and some companies.
NEUT31|So would I speculate in a company like Spotify, let's dig a little further.
NEUT32|It's estimated that the company will be selling for around $20 billion.
NEUT33|And some experts are predicting as high as 23 billion.
NEUT34|So put simply, Spotify want to sell this company that is making negative $1.5 billion and charge you 20 billion for it.
NEUT35|I just can't bring myself to do it and to make this investment even more high risk, Spotify's competition are literally Apple and Google to succeed in this industry, they plainly have to take on some of the biggest companies of the world and win over for me.
NEUT36|I'm staying away from this IPO.
BEAR37|The downside is just too big.
BEAR38|It looks like it's going to be too expensive and there are too many risks.
NEUT39|If I had a guess on what's going to happen, I think people are going to hype up Spotify's IPO.
BULL40|They're looking for high returns in this expensive market.
BEAR41|It will probably initially sell for a high market cap and a high price, and then slowly or not, so slowly go down in price.
NEUT42|That's my prediction anyway.
NEUT43|OK, and that's all you need to know for Spotify's upcoming IPO.
BULL44|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT45|If you did leave a like on the video, it's always appreciated of catching next time we've run.
NEUT46|"See you later."""
