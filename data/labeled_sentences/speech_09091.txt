NEUT0|"""But here this is another good example of."
NEUT1|Most likely I mean most likely those three days are short covering.
NEUT2|Because if you, if you shorted this thing up, you know six 5700 bucks is not 400.
BEAR3|You're making a killing.
NEUT4|We talked about this last week.
NEUT5|And really, when we get into.
NEUT6|Situations like this where the trend is down and it's moving the way it's been moving, you look at the market you look at just this particular stock.
NEUT7|You're going to have these pops.
NEUT8|And it's really not much different than trading.
NEUT9|The upside, it's exactly the same, because when when things are bullish.
BEAR10|The taking of bearish trade on the Super Bowl is stock.
NEUT11|Should be short term one to three days typically.
NEUT12|Use the trend is the friend.
NEUT13|The trend is going to continue most likely until something big happens to change it, and now we're in the same boat.
NEUT14|We're in a downtrend, and so we're going to have the exact opposite types of movements where we're in a downtrend an when the downtrend gets extended.
NEUT15|It will probably retrace to the upside when it gets oversold, just like when it gets overbought.
NEUT16|It usually has a pullback.
NEUT17|And now we're just flipping the picture over.
BEAR18|I mean, we're clearly in a downtrend.
BEAR19|We've broken a massive support level today.
NEUT20|Unless it somehow rallies back by the end of the day, leaves a big hammer there.
NEUT21|So now pretty much every trade we should be looking at.
NEUT22|The majority of our trade should be bearish trades.
NEUT23|And then when it gets super oversold like Chipotle did here when you have a period like this that goes from 560 to 400.
NEUT24|160 points when you have that type of scenario.
NEUT25|Odds are it's going to bounce and if you can take advantage of that.
NEUT26|Why not, right?
NEUT27|So we're just looking for, you know, any bullish trade would be a short term bounce one to three days typically.
NEUT28|Everything else I mean start trend trading.
NEUT29|The downside of this stuff.
NEUT30|Amazon was another one we're looking at in.
NEUT31|This thing is, yeah, I mean it's similar.
NEUT32|We talked about this, possibly doing what CMG did.
NEUT33|And it's entirely possible.
NEUT34|I think it's less likely with Amazon because it's not.
NEUT35|As acceptable to issues that CMG is below, Google is the other one too.
NEUT36|We're looking at, but I mean similar picture on both of them.
NEUT37|Amazon and Google very similar.
BEAR38|The volume doesn't accelerate, we get lower volume today.
NEUT39|I mean, Amazon is a good example of Amazon.
BEAR40|The volume, as of right now has decelerated, even though realistically we're 2 1/2 hours in the market were at about 3/4 of what we had on.
NEUT41|Tuesday volume there.
NEUT42|Which was an update.
NEUT43|So if we don't have significant volume today, if it slows down enough to where it's just the same as yesterday, or maybe a little tiny bit more.
NEUT44|Then the deceleration, the drop is slowing down the momentum to the downside is slowing down a little bit, so those are really close I'm looking for is when the volume decelerates and the stock seems to be decelerating then.
NEUT45|We have a couple of choices.
NEUT46|We could either try to catch a bounce or wait for it to bounce.
BULL47|"Gonna load up on put."""
