NEUT0|"""However, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see from this chart is for the one day chart I postdoc, nearly closed at the top end of the whole day, so 116.5.
BULL2|But it's a little bit lower.
NEUT3|Then the moment it closed, so it still has a.
NEUT4|La Upper tail here, so it's a great volume, so it seems that somebody.
NEUT5|As selling or buying here, but is that studying or buying?
NEUT6|Let's check.
NEUT7|The daily chart.
NEUT8|So here we can see from this daily chart it forms a green candle.
BULL9|This green candle has jumped three percent, 3.08%.
NEUT10|It's a.
BEAR11|Very exciting game for the Apple stock, but as we can see from the daily chart here, the volume is low.
BEAR12|It's even lower than the day before yesterday, so it's very.
BEAR13|Pessimistic sign for the stock 'cause when it break out from the Ms it should have a strong support to support it to go further.
NEUT14|Otherwise if there's no volume is hard for the selling pressure to be resisted.
BULL15|So I in my opinion, even though Apple gained 3% last night in your stream, time is still hard for it to go higher.
BEAR16|Because we can see here after the break out from the year may it has been flat here.
NEUT17|No more more and no more volume.
BEAR18|So it's not a good sign for the whole market.
NEUT19|"Hold your money, don't go back too soon."""
