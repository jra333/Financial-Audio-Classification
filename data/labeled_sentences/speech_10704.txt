BULL0|"""Alright, Doctor, usual activity got 3 for me."
NEUT1|I do Scott, I'll hit him quick, uh, the first one is Boeing 245 calls.
NEUT2|The stock was roughly 242 this morning.
NEUT3|They started buying the two Forties 245 two 50s that expire this week.
NEUT4|I joined them.
BULL5|These are the biggest numbers we've seen in Boeing in quite awhile.
NEUT6|It's not retail buying its institutional with a time frame of this Friday Scott, so I'll probably be in these trades just two more days because obviously that's when they expire.
NEUT7|Second trade.
NEUT8|Take a look at Visa.
NEUT9|The 2:15 calls out there in May.
NEUT10|The stock was 2:10.
NEUT11|This morning they're buying those two fifteens.
NEUT12|We both know that stimulus checks is probably part of the story here.
NEUT13|The other part is maybe people going back into restaurants and hopefully into bricks and mortar stores as well as online Scott.
NEUT14|Lastly Applied Materials AM 80.
NEUT15|They were buying the 1:25 calls.
NEUT16|That's the at the money call in April.
BEAR17|They were also buying calls all the way up to the 135 strike.
NEUT18|A lot of volume in here it was eight to one calls to puts that I love to see that kind of volume, so I'll probably be in these calls right around three weeks.
NEUT19|Got the weekly calls.
NEUT20|Like I said, the Boeing's about two days and the others.
NEUT21|"The make calls probably four to six weeks."""
