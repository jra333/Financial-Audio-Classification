NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol."
NEUT1|TNX P. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, overall the trend continues.
NEUT5|The one difference today was it finally didn't put in higher highs, which it can get a little deceiving 'cause when people get used to put, you know, the price.
NEUT6|Put in higher highs after day and higher highs and then another day.
BEAR7|It can almost seem like oh something wrong is the chart broken?
NEUT8|What's going on?
NEUT9|You know the price didn't put in a new high today and as nice as that would be for a price to be able to put in a new high every single day?
NEUT10|If only that's how the market worked.
NEUT11|It's just you know that's just not how it works.
NEUT12|So therefore you know it's not anything to worry about, especially when you have what's been going on.
NEUT13|Continue to play out.
NEUT14|And what matters most is exactly what happened today.
BULL15|So again did not put in a new high.
NEUT16|But let's look at where the low was today down there.
NEUT17|So let's compare that with the previous level right there.
NEUT18|Let's compare that with the previous low right here.
NEUT19|Let's compare that with the previous low right there.
NEUT20|Let's compare that with the previous low down here, and if you envision each of these laws, is there steps what do you have?
NEUT21|Again, emphasis on the word overall, but from the overall perspective you still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT22|And that's what it's all about, assuming you care about the grand scheme of things.
NEUT23|Everything is so perfectly fine.
NEUT24|Even though the price didn't put in a new high, now I understand from the perspective of a day trader that bought right there and wanted to buy and sell within, you know 10 minutes.
NEUT25|Yeah, from that perspective the chart still looking pretty bad, but assuming you do just care about the general flow of things, the overall point of view, then everything is still perfectly fine as you see here, the price is still putting those higher bases and as long as higher base are put in play, then given enough time, everything else eventually will take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT26|So moving forward just continue to focus on building with her stepson.
NEUT27|Those you know higher lows and sit back and let the trend do its thing.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
