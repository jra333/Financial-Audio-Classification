NEUT0|"""Alright, here's a question I'm dying to ask Suze Orman."
NEUT1|What is your take on Bitcoin?
NEUT2|I love Bitcoin.
NEUT3|My women and money podcast.
NEUT4|I think it was two or three weeks ago.
NEUT5|I did an entire.
NEUT6|I think I did two things on Bitcoin as to why I like it.
NEUT7|I like the University University aliti of it.
NEUT8|I like that that it's just there and the corporations that are investing in it.
NEUT9|I do not like Bitcoin.
NEUT10|Andy as a currency.
NEUT11|I don't like it where you gonna buy a Tesla or you're going to buy something with it.
NEUT12|I like it as a possible replacement for gold as an investment.
NEUT13|And I personally played Bitcoin through micro strategies.
NEUT14|In June of last year I I bought Micro Strategies at about $125 a share.
NEUT15|Right around there I believe.
NEUT16|And.
NEUT17|There was something about Mike, the CEO that was just this man is making sense to me.
NEUT18|I wrote it all the way up an I sold that I think it was last week at it right about $1000 a share because I didn't like for the first time Bitcoin was going up, but micro strategies was going down.
NEUT19|Now what I tell my listeners and what I would tell everybody Bitcoin is seriously risky.
NEUT20|I would not be investing in Bitcoin with money.
NEUT21|That I could not afford to lose 'cause the swings are not just going to be a point or two a day.
NEUT22|They're going to be $5000 worth one day.
BEAR23|It's going to be up 7% down 10%.
BEAR24|It's going to be all over the place, but I think it's something that would hurt people to pull.
NEUT25|Maybe if they had it to lose $100 a month in and I personally would do it through PayPal 'cause PayPal makes it so easy.
NEUT26|And it's not that big of a hit given in terms of Commission.
NEUT27|It's like 1 1/2 percent 2% depending on how much you're investing every month.
NEUT28|I don't think that's that big of a hit.
NEUT29|"Right to really just see what happens over the years, but I happen to like Bitcoin and I like the premise behind it a lot and I really love how Kathy would loves Bitcoin."""
