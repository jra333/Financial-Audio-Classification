NEUT0|"""All right, welcome back Tesla's S&P 500 debut is set to put 100 billion in trades in motion."
NEUT1|This article starts off by saying additions and subtractions to the S&P 500 or normally a whole home affair.
BULL2|The 509th biggest company United States might jump to 497th place and thus into the index.
NEUT3|Investors who track it by the one stock and sell another.
NEUT4|In other words, here's a Forbes article.
NEUT5|Do S&P 500 investors really want to buy Tesla now?
NEUT6|And after replaces this chart here and he describes it in words, the value of S&P 500 membership, the value of a spot in the S&P 500 varies based on.
NEUT7|Each company's weight in the index.
NEUT8|In Tesla's case senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices estimates the inclusion will generate about 51 billion worth of new demand for shares.
NEUT9|This analysis presumes that passive fund heavyweights like Vanguard and Fidelity will be forced to add Tesla, so they're widely owned.
NEUT10|S&P 500 tracking ETF.
NEUT11|So going back to this Wall Street Journal article, this chart over here shows the big U stocks to the market value of the top S&P 500 stocks, including incoming Tesla number one is Apple.
NEUT12|Which is valued at almost approximately $2 trillion.
NEUT13|Number 2 is Microsoft 3 is Amazon for Alphabet 5 Facebook and six Tesla.
NEUT14|So you can see Tesla is catching up to Facebook, probably going to pass it soon and going back to this text over here.
NEUT15|This is critically important.
NEUT16|The decision rests with SNP, which said it intends to announce results of the consultation on Monday.
BULL17|Regardless of the outcome, investors and traders expect the market for Tesla shares to heat up even further ahead of the inclusion.
BULL18|Goldman Sachs Group Incorporated predicts shares will eventually touch $600, a 2% gain from current levels by the time Tesla joins the index.
NEUT19|So what does this all mean?
BULL20|This means most likely most likely, Tesla stock will be driven up.
NEUT21|Now, back to the Forbes article when Tesla joins the S&P 500 next month, it will be the biggest debut ever in the world's most important stock index.
BULL22|Traders are expecting huge volume on December 18th, the final day before Tesla is added.
NEUT23|Let me ask you this, what are you going to do if you don't own any Tesla shares?
NEUT24|Are you going to buy?
NEUT25|Are you going to take the risk?
