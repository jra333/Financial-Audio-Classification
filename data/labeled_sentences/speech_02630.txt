BULL0|"""Doctor man good morning."
BEAR1|Just it's been an exhausting week for all.
NEUT2|Let me get to the single point estimate of Citigroup and where you think this unemployment rate will go, what should we see this morning at 8:30?
NEUT3|Well, I mean, I think there's a range of numbers that are going to potentially come out here, but I think what's more important is you know.
NEUT4|Frankly, it almost doesn't matter what the number is, because the range is so large.
NEUT5|I think what matters is to think about where we are going forward.
BEAR6|I mean, I think the market is priced in a really bad number.
NEUT7|They're expecting action by the Fed to actually deploy some of the programs that they've put into place.
NEUT8|A really dramatic set of programs that they put into place.
NEUT9|It's time to you know the market is expecting some action.
NEUT10|Two to be done with that program, so I think the number is is really not going to be a key element here, it's it's going forward.
NEUT11|What happens to people who are furloughed who think of them as furloughed?
BEAR12|Do they stay furloughed or they do they end up getting fired?
NEUT13|So I think we have to look beyond the number that that that everybody knows is going to be the greatest sense, right?
NEUT14|Cancer man economics Doctor Man held a Brandeis at OECD and now it's Citigroup has always been a courageous economics.
NEUT15|I hear that from Gita, Gopinath at the IMF was making real clear.
NEUT16|More is needed.
BULL17|Do you agree with Doctor Gopinath that there's been an under measurement of the fiscal impulse it's needed and we need more now?
NEUT18|So I think we have to distinguish between what's been done in a lot of countries that represents filling the hole.
NEUT19|In other words, we have an extended period of time here when there's no economic activity, people are not earning income.
BEAR20|There's no revenue on business side simply because of the of the shut shut down.
NEUT21|So what we have so far is to fill that hole.
NEUT22|There's there's nothing yet about stimulus really, because there isn't.
NEUT23|You know, people are not able to go out so.
NEUT24|Where we are pre stimulus.
NEUT25|In terms of of what fiscal monetary policy are doing.
NEUT26|And I think that there's an issue about targeting.
NEUT27|I think there's an issue about what are we going to do going forward?
NEUT28|That's going to put into place the capability of the economy to make up the whole, you know, filling the hole is one thing, but according to our projections and and I think that they're generous.
NEUT29|I think that you know when we come out of this next year.
BULL30|You know the the virus is contained and we and we have a growth resume next year.
BEAR31|We still will have lossed GDP for the level of GDP compared to January of this year and that loss in GDP.
NEUT32|The stuff never made up.
BEAR33|I think that's a real problem because that is the experience post gross financial program financial crisis.
BEAR34|And of course the damage associated with loss of GDP is something that is associated with productivity growth.
NEUT35|It's a.
NEUT36|"Young people not having a wage profile of their elders, these sorts of things."""
