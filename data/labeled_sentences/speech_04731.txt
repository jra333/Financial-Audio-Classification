NEUT0|"""Hi Fools, healthcare analyst David Williamson going over the biggest winners and losers in today's healthcare sector and there is no bigger winner in healthcare or really the broader markets overall than mankind."
NEUT1|The FDA Advisory Committee, which is a key point in the approval process for the biotechs inhalable insulin Afrezza, shocked the world.
BULL2|They voted that the FDA approval FREZZA in both type one and Type 2 diabetes.
NEUT3|Now that wasn't necessarily a shock.
BULL4|I even said that I expected a favorable.
NEUT5|Outcome, but what was shocking was the degree of the route.
BULL6|If this were the Super Bowl mankind longsword, the Seattle Seahawks and Bears in Peyton Manning's Broncos all night long, the final outcome was 13 to one for type one and a 14 to oh vote for type Two approval now shares were on hold yesterday, but doubled after hours before settling on a gain in the high to mid 70s.
NEUT7|Today.
BULL8|It's been a long road to commercialization for mankind, and it's almost there given the overwhelmingly positive nature of the Advisory Committee.
NEUT9|I would be stunned at this point if the FDA rejects Afrezza it still could.
NEUT10|That's perfectly within its rights, but it would be somewhat unprecedented based on the strength of that advisory committee outcome.
NEUT11|The only regulatory questions now surround really the labeling of the drug.
NEUT12|However, the real questions remain in regards to commercialization.
BULL13|Will mankind be able to find a partner?
NEUT14|Will doctors and diabetics be interested in mankind's inhaler?
NEUT15|These were the questions that have plagued.
BULL16|Other popular drug makers that I like to say the obesity drug space, you know these were stocked with meteoric rises to approval towards approval arena in Veves in particular.
BEAR17|And then they have not really fared very well.
BEAR18|Vivas notably has collapsed pretty hard after they couldn't find a partner for their obesity drug and they haven't found good uptake among doctors and patients.
NEUT19|So that remains a struggle and it remains to be seen if mankind.
NEUT20|Runs into similar challenges, but today mankind investors should not worry about a thing.
NEUT21|Just look at your brokerage statements and smile.
BULL22|Well done.
BULL23|Thanks for watching.
