NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today we're going to be doing some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency LTO, which is LTO network against ever US based on the finance crisis and this is just a follow up from I think like two or three TA videos I've done on this one."
NEUT1|I think I started doing them back around like this candle back here so I ultimately outline like that.
NEUT2|59 to 60 cent level.
NEUT3|I think it was more like the 6060 cent range was kind of like the breakout spot to watch for this one so broke out on some decent volume but couldn't hold it.
BULL4|Retested that support we talked about at 50 before ultimately popping through and this one offered like a 35 to 40% move before having a pretty strong pullback.
NEUT5|This was kind of like the same day that Bitcoin was pulling back hard, but it did.
NEUT6|It, you know, hang around above that like 58 to 60 cent mark on the daily closing right around like $0.61.
BULL7|It had another move up with decent volume and this was the level that we had outlined right around that like 70 cent mark 'cause all these trend lines are already drawn out.
NEUT8|I'm just leaving them here from prior videos.
NEUT9|So we broke that retested.
BULL10|It stayed nice and high, so like.
NEUT11|For these shorter term plays I also flipped to the lower time frames and you can see like on the lower timeframes.
BULL12|This kind of level was holding pretty strong before another pop.
NEUT13|So now what I'm looking for is.
BEAR14|I'm looking for this 80 cent level to hold and I mean this one's in a super strong uptrend and this is one that we've been pretty bullish on in this channel since about $0.60.
NEUT15|So I mean.
BULL16|Realistically, you could probably already be up like 50 plus percent on this one.
NEUT17|I think the high was like right around that like 90 cent Mark.
BULL18|So I mean this ones offered already some pretty serious returns.
NEUT19|But I mean I think the biggest breakout spot at this point is like $0.90 with some volume and I think you know if we get some volume similar to like this breakout spot right here, I think that or even like this green candle.
NEUT20|I think you know ninety cents a break of $0.90 with this kind of volume.
BULL21|Probably sent this one to a dollar pretty quickly, so maybe another pretty nice move.
NEUT22|But again, you know this is kind of like.
NEUT23|The level to consolidate above at this point is like the 7879 cent mark, and you know, I'm pretty much just watching this one now to continue its uptrend until it's pretty much starts to breakdown.
NEUT24|'cause like at this point there's really nothing slowing this one down.
NEUT25|I mean it's just going to be a matter of if the chart breaks down or not, so.
NEUT26|I think that's kind of like the biggest thing to watch for, especially like this trend line and then you can also use like a mix of this trend line.
NEUT27|Maybe 8080 cents as support.
BULL28|So I mean, the risk reward is pretty good.
NEUT29|I think into the 90s potentially retests a dollar break, a dollar and this one could be like one 10120 really fast.
NEUT30|But again, that's just kind of my thoughts, and if that starts to happen, will obviously continue to update on this one.
NEUT31|But yeah, I mean, I'm not really.
BEAR32|I mean, the bearish case would be it just starts to lose all these support levels.
NEUT33|You know, breaks down to like 7273 and if it can hold those levels.
NEUT34|I mean, I'm not really super interested in the shorter term at that point.
NEUT35|But you know, that's kind of just some of my thoughts on this one, so I hope this helps some of you guys.
NEUT36|And as always, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT37|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT38|If you're going to do any investing, go speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT39|'cause like everything I'm talking about right now, is just my opinion, right?
NEUT40|Like it's all all my opinion, especially being that I'm a little bit more of a shorter term trader.
NEUT41|Like for the most part and less and less, it's like a longer term, kind of like small cap play.
NEUT42|I'll usually just be like trading on the shorter time frame so it's just my opinion.
BULL43|"So as always, guys, thank you for watching."""
