NEUT0|"""Hi, today's the 14th of March and let us look at the nifty once again."
BEAR1|So nifty futures actually fell pretty sharply on Friday.
BEAR2|So on Thursday, the analysis which we posted was that this was ABC correction and this was wave one, a pretty impulsive move.
NEUT3|We have two down and wave.
BULL4|Three up was supposed to come then if they did gap up significantly, but then after that sold off throughout the day.
BEAR5|And as it was selling off throughout the day, it was clear that this bullish wave count was probably not the right wave count.
BEAR6|And therefore as nifty closed this opening gap and started to fall further, we closed all over long positions completely by the late afternoon and on the closing we went home with small amounts of short positions.
NEUT7|Not much.
NEUT8|So what is the possibility now?
NEUT9|Now it is possible that the bullish wave count is still valid.
NEUT10|In that case, we will move the wave two label here, and this is a flat correction for wave two and then we have three up can still come up.
NEUT11|Or if you leave the wave to hear.
NEUT12|We have a.
NEUT13|A leading diagonal wave one for wave one and then wave two and wave three should start again of the third wave.
BULL14|Now in both these conditions, NIFTY should open with a large gap up tomorrow, an continue to move up with great momentum.
NEUT15|Until that happens, we are not sure that this is the right wave count.
NEUT16|So as things stand right now, we are not 100% sure of where in which direction is the nifty likely to move.
NEUT17|But we can always keep the various possibilities so that we can act on those possibilities based on the price action, which happens in the next two days.
BEAR18|Now there is a bearish possibility as well.
NEUT19|Let us see what that is.
BEAR20|What we're seeing here is a three wave decline, which we label Wave a, a three wave rise back to almost the old high for Wave B, and now we're looking for a five wave decline on Wave C to complete a flat correction.
NEUT21|That is also a possibility.
NEUT22|So both the bullish and bearish possibilities remain on the table as of today.
NEUT23|And hopefully the price action within the next two days is going to resolve this one way or the other.
NEUT24|Till then we are going ahead with very light positions and let the market show its hand as to what it wants to do.
NEUT25|That's all for today.
NEUT26|"Thank you and bye bye."""
