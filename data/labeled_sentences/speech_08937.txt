NEUT0|"""What's your takeaway from the divergent of the things?"
NEUT1|Well, the clear winners there Taylor to your point.
NEUT2|Apple and Facebook.
BULL3|Apple just extraordinary up 85% of the year.
BULL4|Facebook up 55% the other fangs up closer to 20 or 30%.
BULL5|Still great gains on the year.
BULL6|And you see the complex overall higher.
NEUT7|What's interesting 2019?
NEUT8|Really, the year of record highs for the Fang complex.
BULL9|Overall the last record high all the way back in July.
NEUT10|But those two stocks two companies really pulling away.
BEAR11|With the lead Apple and Facebook, Apple putting in record high after record high and you know behind that buying power Taylor you have to think it has something to do with 2018 because between October 2018 and December 2018, Apple fell about 40%.
BEAR12|So this year they pre announced early in January setting up relatively low bar numbers.
BULL13|An investors went all in even though the technicals at that point looked a little bit shaky, but you have to think that some of those traders thought that it would be a pretty sure bet it's turned out that way again and a gain of 85%.
NEUT14|And Facebook last year.
NEUT15|Taylor.
BEAR16|It was a real disaster.
BEAR17|They had a bumpy road and then of course they had that horrible second quarter that trading day in July.
BEAR18|More down more than 20%.
BEAR19|The worst day in record on the year.
BEAR20|Last year, down 25%.
BEAR21|So another case of a stock that was down more than some of the peers, investors, traders simply snapping it up.
BULL22|"Leading to this banner year in 2019 for some of these stocks and those two in particular."""
