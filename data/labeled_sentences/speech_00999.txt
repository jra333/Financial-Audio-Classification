NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol VWAGY."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level musically would make the chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up there above the $40 mark.
BEAR8|Now don't get me wrong, the price falls below 40.
NEUT9|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL10|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of power moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and looking at things from the bigger picture point of view, but it's with the purple line.
NEUT12|There comes into play the 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average keyword.
NEUT14|Definitely moving understand the price is way up there that lines way down there, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move.
NEUT15|That right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT16|Just watch out for blind.
NEUT17|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control rights.
NEUT18|Visualize that that is what is being represented insurance and about 40 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT19|First, the level to watch is going to be right there at the $45.00 mark and then after 45 just a question of where the overall party stop today and that was right up there at about the $49.00 mark.
NEUT20|So 45.
NEUT21|49 next couple of key Battlegrounds watch moving forward but All in all very impressive trend and as long as the price keeps on building those higher bases, that is by far it matters most.
NEUT22|So let's see how this one continues to play out.

BULL26|How I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT28|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR29|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
