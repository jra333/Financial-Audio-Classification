NEUT0|"""Time for unusual activity."
BULL1|John Najarian is back, at least for this moment.
NEUT2|John, what do you have at least for this moment?
BULL3|Scott, we've got some real strong activity in Palantir.
NEUT4|I talked about how the feeding frenzy was going on in work options, which are now up over 180,000 calls.
NEUT5|But in Palantir, man, this is big.
BULL6|Buying Scott, they're buying aggressively all the way up to the May 40 calls.
NEUT7|This is a stock that came public, basically just about six weeks ago, Scott.
NEUT8|At 10 and now, it's already pushing into the high 20s, so I bought the January 30 calls Scott.
NEUT9|Like I say, they're buying all the way up to the 40s out in May.
BEAR10|There's a feeding frenzy and Palantir.
NEUT11|It's over 380,000 calls.
NEUT12|Double what we see in work right now.
BEAR13|Second trade Scott lows.
BULL14|The March 170 calls aggressively bought.
NEUT15|This is one that you normally see a lift into March, and that is because of course people go in there to buy there.
NEUT16|Early plantings and so forth.
NEUT17|Get a head start on spring time.
NEUT18|"I'm buying these calls the Nov One 70s with the stock at about 153 bucks a share, Scott."""
