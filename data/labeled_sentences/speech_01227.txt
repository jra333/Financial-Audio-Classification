BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel for another video."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking about is America ticker symbol Xe Om and man has it been a crazy week.
BULL2|I called up the NGO at $1.33 and it went over $7.00 last night.
NEUT3|In the after hours before pulling back and we also called out check Capita Dollar 22 and that hit over $3 and after hours last night before pulling back today at around 2:00.
NEUT4|So Needless to say it's been amazing start to 2021 if you haven't already, make sure to hit the subscribe button down below to keep up with our daily videos.
NEUT5|So the company just recently announced they're putting a new CEO in charge of the startup diagnostics firm.
NEUT6|Another announcement that we got was that the company has planned to start commercializing the new acoustic wave technology, so this technology they're playing commercializes called True former, which is used to detect thyroid adrenal disease in both cats and dogs.
NEUT7|So the current way that.
NEUT8|Animals, cats, and dogs are tested for these diseases.
NEUT9|When you go in for an appointment for them, usually you don't get the results for a couple of days afterwards, but this technology is true form a when you go in for your appointment and you get this, you get the results that same day.
BULL10|So as far as when this technology is going to be out for the public use for commercial use of the company announced that they plan to do this in March, so I think this technology is pretty big for the company and I see the stock pushing up to a dollar pretty soon.
BEAR11|I do expect to see a pullback as we kind of lose a little bit of hype.
BULL12|Since it isn't until March but come March, I could see this stock being up to around 4-5 dollars.
NEUT13|I've been following this talk for a couple of weeks now waiting for some big news and I think this is the news right here that we were waiting to hear.
NEUT14|So what do you guys think about the company?
