NEUT0|"""Let's do the futures outlook."
BULL1|Now the NASDAQ 100 is rallying again today, Bill Baruch and Jeff Kilburg joining me now to talk about that Bill, you're up first big tech.
NEUT2|That's the topic.
NEUT3|There are a lot of driving forces here in technicals are certainly one of them.
NEUT4|Last week the market start exactly at our upside target 13,550 and then on.
NEUT5|The Lowe's take a look at this chart, held the 50 day moving average in a trendline.
NEUT6|Going back to the middle of December.
NEUT7|So in the rearview mirror, there's a big level, now 12,897.
BULL8|That's the 100% extension from the February highs last year to those March lows out above.
NEUT9|There we are calling the NASDAQ in a breakout, so now we're looking at that.
BULL10|13,550 again, gets out above their closes above there in a week.
NEUT11|There's no doubt in my mind we're talking 14,000.
BULL12|Plus interesting Jeff, you agree.
BULL13|Alright George, well I think we do push higher short term but I know we're all waiting for Super Bowl Sunday.
NEUT14|But today is the Super Bowl for all giant technology names.
NEUT15|So look at Amazon Google or eagerly awaiting the report after the close they make up 15% of the NASDAQ 100 so it's all contingent upon if they deliver it.
BULL16|Beat expectations where the NASDAQ 100 is going.
NEUT17|Yeah, well they could beat and still go down huh?
NEUT18|Hello Apple and Facebook so it's not it.
NEUT19|Maybe it's not so cut and dry.
NEUT20|Will see guys?
NEUT21|Thank you.
NEUT22|"We'll talk again soon."""
