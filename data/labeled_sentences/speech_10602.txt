NEUT0|"""So on the workings of another man's brain and his name, is Marc Benioff and you know him very well and you guys before we wrap up our first block of programming here, let's get to this deal that was announced."
NEUT1|Of course, after the close yesterday.
NEUT2|Just like we told you it would be Salesforce announcing the acquisition of Slack, it is a big deal for them.
NEUT3|We can of course see that Salesforce stock now they reported earnings as well.
BEAR4|Jim, I'll let you weigh in in terms of that and how the quarter look, but you can see the stock is down and that is going to happen.
NEUT5|Impact on slack.
NEUT6|It's as we said on Monday.
NEUT7|It is a little bit more cash than stock.
NEUT8|It's 2679 in cash.
NEUT9|And then it's .0776 of a Salesforce share so you can figure out what that is worth at this point.
NEUT10|But Jim, a couple of things you know, there are those who are wondering, well, does it really take sales for us into an area that they are not as familiar with?
NEUT11|Is it mean that he is going to start making acquisitions outside their core competency or not?
BEAR12|And then there have been a few people concerned with the CFO's departure.
NEUT13|And the replacement of a long tenured person at the company.
NEUT14|But Amy Weaver, the new CFO, was a general counsel.
NEUT15|Kind of seems sometimes can be an odd move to have made, and I've heard a couple of shareholders this morning.
NEUT16|A bit concerned about that.
NEUT17|Well, Hawkins is just to love feet.
NEUT18|I'm sorry, well CFO is love thing.
NEUT19|Yes and very very close to the investment community.
NEUT20|Yes, and relied on for many years by the investment community and so that also David.
NEUT21|Let's let before you jump to conclusions, 7 firms today wrote about it.
BEAR22|Yep, 7 firms hated it.
NEUT23|So there's unanimity.
NEUT24|Yeah, I mean, yeah, let's not forget that when people get together alright, what do they have to say about it?
NEUT25|It's too expensive, but Mark doesn't know what he's doing.
NEUT26|He asked, he said, no deals in the next three months.
NEUT27|And here's a deal.
BEAR28|Slack was doing very poorly.
NEUT29|You can't take on Microsoft Teams, but cannot believe how much they paid.
BEAR30|It was not an elite company that they bought, so David, I think you know it's mixed.
BEAR31|It's mixed.
NEUT32|Well, let's hear from Mr. Benioff himself who joined you last night and see what he had to say.
NEUT33|Black changes everything and make Salesforce a whole new type of company.
NEUT34|A company that is truly architected to work from anywhere.
NEUT35|Now we have already introduced Salesforce work from anywhere a couple months ago.
NEUT36|You know that.
NEUT37|But now with Seattle really supercharges our approach and let's all of our customers re architect their workforce to be truly from anywhere.
NEUT38|David, he is just saying Microsoft here we come, right?
NEUT39|We're going to be a half a trillion dollar enterprise when we're done, we're going to take sales of Slack up three times, and we're putting together a coalition and David that coalition will include Zoom OK, which is on the right side of Mark.
NEUT40|Yep, it could include Snowflake, which reports this week Tableau deal.
BULL41|It's been very subdued, is very successful.
NEUT42|This is a soup to nuts attempt.
NEUT43|To say Sachin Nadella.
NEUT44|It's war wow well that sounds like the kind of story that we're going to be following for potentially years to come.
NEUT45|I predict that the seven firms they will eat Crow.
NEUT46|Also, I'm going to.
NEUT47|I'll give them goldens or great great coupon.
NEUT48|They can have their choice.
BULL49|You've been a supporter of this company.
NEUT50|Softy, like the exact target deal.
NEUT51|I've been right, right, right, right, right, right?
BEAR52|And it's hard to get better against Benioff.
NEUT53|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT54|"Thanks for watching CNBC."""
