NEUT0|"""It's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol Anio."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very very impressive move here on NIO.
NEUT5|Finally got the break of that $59 Mark which I've talked about quite a bit and then just kept on moving and moving.
NEUT6|So certainly updates need to be made here as we head into the weekend.
NEUT7|But first level of support on the newer levels to watch and what I'd call it.
BULL8|You know the ideal area in Franklin would make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
NEUT9|You know ideally if the price can stay above $60.00 that would be a massive sign of power.
NEUT10|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that level.
NEUT11|That does not mean the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage step above that area.
BULL12|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and looking at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
BEAR14|I'm bad with the Purple line.
NEUT15|There comes into play the 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT17|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move.
NEUT18|That right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control him visualize that.
NEUT21|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT22|Yes and about 60 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|Let me squeeze on the charter just a bit more to offer up a bit more context here.
NEUT24|Next key level to watch over all going to be right up there around that $63 mark.
NEUT25|So 63 Public Enemy number one headed into next week.
NEUT26|But on all any angle you look at it.
BULL27|Fantastic way to end the week.
NEUT28|Very nice movement, not just question of can this continue on into next week.
BULL29|Let's see what happens, but the Bulls definitely closed the week with some good solid authority.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
