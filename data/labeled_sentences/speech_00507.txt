NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of an XP is range between $3.65 per share and $24.34 per share."
NEUT1|How are those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $3.65 per share represents the company's cash for share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $3.65 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $24.34 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings.
NEUT4|So price at 2434 represents the fractional payment that we would all pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT5|Now this is a conservative way to value the company is different from the price to earnings ratio, but it begs the question, what are they currently trading at today?
BULL6|Well, they're currently trading at a price of 144 with $0.86, which is well beyond our intrinsic value high range.
NEUT7|The high end of things here of 2434 and look at the PE ratio guys.
NEUT8|This means this dash here means that there isn't a PE ratio because they're posting net losses.
BEAR9|Unfortunately for XP semiconductors.
NEUT10|Reasonable assumption guys, they're overpriced, so don't put your money here.
NEUT11|But where should you put your money?
NEUT12|Don't keep it in a bank account either.
NEUT13|Invest your money in the Vanguard 500 index fund so that way it could earn 12.98% over the next 10 years.
NEUT14|Now we would keep it in the Vanguard 500 index fund until an XP drops beneath $24.34.
NEUT15|That's that's the reasoning here guys.
NEUT16|I just like Vanguard 500 because Warren Buffett used him to beat out the hedge fund experts quote unquote 08 through 18 when they bet him and all he did was Park's money here.
NEUT17|Did nothing and one kind of shocking.
NEUT18|If you think about it.
