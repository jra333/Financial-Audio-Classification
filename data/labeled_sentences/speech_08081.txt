NEUT0|"""Let's get to the other big story of the morning Amazon and Jeff Bezos is decision to step down as CEO, but remain on as executive chair."
NEUT1|Andy Jassy, who has been running the companies a WS cloud business, is taking over as Chief executive starting in the third quarter of this year.
NEUT2|Gianforte has spoken to Jassy freezes frequently, is booked him on the show a lot too, and he joins us right now with some thoughts about what to take away from this.
NEUT3|John, what do you think?
NEUT4|Good morning, good morning?
NEUT5|Yeah, it's become somewhat of a tradition for us.
NEUT6|We've been talking at their annual awos.
NEUT7|Reinvent conference for years, Anne.
NEUT8|So many thoughts about Andy Jassy here.
NEUT9|It's interesting because he's been with Amazon since 1997, so he is not quite a founder.
NEUT10|Of course, that's clearly Jeff Bezos, but he is a founder of a WS itself.
NEUT11|Also interesting that he was one of the first to work with Jeff Bezos in this technical assistant role that he really developed into a more of a chief of staff type role and.
NEUT12|When I was talking him a few years ago, he told me when Jeff Bezos first approached him about taking that role jazz.
NEUT13|He turned it down.
NEUT14|He said it's not well defined enough.
NEUT15|The couple of people who had done it before they were working on some ancillary product projects that weren't core.
NEUT16|He didn't really want to do that, so he and Bezos had this back and forth about it.
NEUT17|Until Jassy push the idea that it's more like a chief of staff type role where he was deeply involved in the core things that Bezos was doing everyday.
BULL18|Basis allowed him to shape the role in that way, and it turned into a great development experience and.
NEUT19|To me that speaks to the type of relationship that these two guys have, and I spent a lot more time with.
NEUT20|Jacy only interviewed Bezos a couple of times, but the way that Jassy is able to consistently speak for the overall Amazon Strategy talked to his relationship with Jeff Bezos and talked about the way that Jeff Bezos leads all of Amazon.
NEUT21|That leaves me kind of not surprised that Bezos would tap him to lead the entire company forward at this point, Jesse is had his fingers in.
NEUT22|All parts of the company, even though at this point he's really been driving a WS for awhile, so it makes a lot of sense.
NEUT23|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT24|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
