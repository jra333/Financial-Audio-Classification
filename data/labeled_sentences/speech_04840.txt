NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to this new supply and demand technical analysis for Merck and Co. Ticker MRK for February 2020."
NEUT1|This isn't reading disclaimer.
NEUT2|You can pause the video and read it at anytime.
NEUT3|OK, let's pull up the American coal tar chart here.
NEUT4|This is the monthly timeframe as we can see here.
NEUT5|Ticker MRK monthly timeframe American company incorporation.
NEUT6|So that means that every single candle stick.
NEUT7|Here is a month worth of time.
NEUT8|Passes are being rallying, correcting, rallying, correcting, creating demand balances, then rolling, running and then he met these very strong.
NEUT9|Area of supply at all time highs.
NEUT10|I once prostate that is being reacting to it for a couple of months and a half 'cause this is the this candle.
NEUT11|Here is the February 2020 candle so it's still open so it's two months or reacting to it?
NEUT12|Very bad practice action, but they're probably price will continue to rally higher and even eliminate that area supply but we are trying to explain in this is an area with new areas of demand being created and respected all the way up.
NEUT13|OK is that now we have.
NEUT14|Come too.
NEUT15|An area where we just can't go long anymore unless press continues to rally and has a bigger retrenchment.
NEUT16|Well, they always to trade this within this area here, but that's requires some more complex and detailed analysis on.
NEUT17|No, lots of the rules within the strategy and you require little understanding of press action, multiple time frame analysis, and all that.
NEUT18|What I'm trying to say in this analogy is that this is a very tricky scenario compared to other stock analysis and forth analysis that you can watch in my YouTube channel.
NEUT19|So this one is like saying, hey, I'm not interested in you.
BEAR20|I shopping left and focus on other stocks or other assets that are clearly trending up or trending down.
BEAR21|Creating super strong imbalances and all that, but right now it's not a good idea to track this one, even though it could rally from there and break that area of supply.
NEUT22|So this is just an example of how if you start, you are trading the lower time frames.
NEUT23|And strategies or other structure and all that.
NEUT24|And you start going along there because everything is looking up or looking bullish on the daily and four hour when hourly chart and allowed.
NEUT25|Then if you are not aware where the imbalances are located you are in trouble.
BEAR26|You will be in trouble most of the time.
NEUT27|And if you don't know about supply and demand all that you will realize muscles.
BEAR28|Your losses were probably taken against one of these super strong imbalances playing against you.
NEUT29|You are not aware of them, you will.
NEUT30|Probably run into trouble, so if you want to learn where these imbalances are located, went to trader when not to trade them, what to do and wanted to do.

NEUT34|No news or fundamentals analysis.
NEUT35|No earnings needed, no volume analysis, just supply and demand imbalances.
NEUT36|Transfer a few hours a week and that's it.
NEUT37|You don't need anything else.
NEUT38|Focus on your family and friends and enjoy life.
NEUT39|Anyway, enjoy the rest of the day.
