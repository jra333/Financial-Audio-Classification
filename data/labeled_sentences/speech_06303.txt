BULL0|"""It seems like a pretty good deal, but Blackstone, not a bad option for long suffering Crown shelves."
NEUT1|If you just had enough and you're seeing this option to finally just get out at an OK Price, I think the deal will probably go through in one form or another.
NEUT2|Maybe there's another big maybe the board manages to talk Black.
NEUT3|Sign up just a little bit and get a couple more sense so I would do anything just yet.
NEUT4|There's plenty more to play out.
NEUT5|I wouldn't wait for the takeover.
NEUT6|Think you wait to see where there's another offer, wakes up the board can talk these guys up but inappropriate time.
NEUT7|Look, maybe leave five temps in on the table, but completely off the.
NEUT8|The risk of losing multiples of that if you buy now and get do badly, I wouldn't be playing that game personally.
NEUT9|You don't buy into it here, but if you still got it, you'd hold onto it.
NEUT10|The problem they've got is we don't see another bidder at the moment I don't see it being a viable option for anyone else, so unless they can somehow get these guys to bid against themselves, it might be quite difficult, but look if they can, you probably suggest something around the $13.00 mark.
NEUT11|"Probably get it over the line."""
