NEUT0|"""Are you taking a look at ER BB right now?"
NEUT1|Currently trading at 0021?
NEUT2|What's really sticking out here?
NEUT3|I mean, this thing has been going sideways and I've looked through so far today.
NEUT4|21 stock charts and going over in detail like I am right now and I gotta say that ER BB is probably one of the better ones that I've seen today.
NEUT5|That more than likely could be setting up for that potential move here.
NEUT6|So I'm going to put a little bit of a few different lines here to kind of give you an idea to understand what I'm talking about here so.
NEUT7|The 30 day simple moving average.
NEUT8|You get one seven that 20 days at 2 zero.
NEUT9|And then you guys are going to have a resistance level up here as well.
NEUT10|At 2525 is going to be the top.
BULL11|Yeah, the top level of resistance.
NEUT12|So again watch for that bounce right here coming off the 20 day simple moving average.
NEUT13|Not too sure which way to go.
NEUT14|107 million shares traded.
BULL15|You guys had a big move over here.
BEAR16|4 billion shares traded tons of shares.
BULL17|Hopefully those shares are in strong hands as they would say.
NEUT18|If that is obviously that you know people say it's in strong hands, you know.
BULL19|Shares her strong hands.
NEUT20|Usually what that means is that not too many people are trading what they have if they're not reading what they have, it's going to lower down the size of the float and then the more volume that comes in the quicker and higher it could go.
NEUT21|This is kind of rule thumb there, so right now currently trade at 00021.
NEUT22|I'm going to put a little bit of resistance level over here on the 10 day simple moving averages.
NEUT23|Well, let me follow up at 2 two and then offer that to 25 support level 21 and that 17 underneath that.
NEUT24|I think that right here my personal opinion.
BULL25|A break it at 2/5 would confirm it could spike a bullish run here.
NEUT26|So we're going to put in.
NEUT27|There were two one.
NEUT28|Resistance level is going to be at 0022, and that's usually 25 minute.
NEUT29|It really is starting to wind up tight here in my opinion, so support at that 0021.
NEUT30|I put 0020 my bad.
NEUT31|And then 0017.
NEUT32|Here we go.
NEUT33|Alright, so I can't give you guys a better idea on this for ERBB.
NEUT34|Like I said, I do like the way I like what I see here.
NEUT35|Let's see how this all plays out though.
NEUT36|Moving forward so right now 0021 watch resistance at 0022 and 0025.
NEUT37|Support AT20 and 170 Braca.
NEUT38|25 would be bullish.
NEUT39|0017 is a must hold so go ahead and keep an eye on ER BB.
