BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|It's Riley from simple finance today.
NEUT2|I'm not in my usual house.
NEUT3|I'm in my mobile office at work on my car dealership that I'm currently working at.
NEUT4|Just one of the main sources of income today I'm going to be going over my bullish thesis for Tesla.
NEUT5|Why I think in the next year or so it could go back to over $1000 a share, which I'm pretty sure would place it over a trillion dollar market cap before we get going.
NEUT6|Make sure you leave a like comment down below and subscribe to help us and grow my channel immensely.
NEUT7|The first thing I think that's going to help Tesla really reach a trillion dollar market cap by the end of 2020, or possibly into 2021 some point between now.
NEUT8|In the end of 2021 is the batteries that they're coming out with that are going to be in a million mile batteries.
NEUT9|They're going to be releasing little Duracell style batteries for, you know, regular pharmaceutical stores, and target and Walmart to keep an inventory.
NEUT10|This battery is coming on, I think if anyone's if I'm wrong.
NEUT11|Correct me.
NEUT12|September 22nd is going to be huge.
BEAR13|It's going to push the stock unless it fails immensely, which I highly doubt it well.
NEUT14|Elon's been waiting forever for this.
BEAR15|The next thing that's going to push them to the trillion dollar market cap is cyber truck which is going to be huge.
NEUT16|There's already I think 1.
NEUT17|Like over a million pre-orders at $100, a pre order so he raised himself $100 million.
NEUT18|Just like that cyber truck is going to be huge for commercial.
NEUT19|An regular civilian usage.
NEUT20|I know I sell Chevy's I know plenty of people who have already come in.
NEUT21|You know richer, more wealthier people that have pre ordered the cyber truck not even 'cause they're going to use it for you.
NEUT22|Know the giant telling capacity or all the power is going to have but just to have it it's going to be awesome.
NEUT23|Next is Gigafactory Berlin.
NEUT24|They're building 1 in Austin, TX and possibly India soon.
NEUT25|This $5 billion stock offering.
NEUT26|In my opinion was to help raise cash to proceed to build these ginormous factories that are size of multiple football field.
NEUT27|If Tesla successfully builds cars out of these factories and I know they have a pressing machine, that's going to make even the model Y and Model 3, I think 30% lighter.
NEUT28|From what I recall.
NEUT29|A booster 'cause they're paying less money into the cars and you know everything was fixed when they sell Tesla.
NEUT30|It's not like when I sell a car and I have to negotiate with the customer.
NEUT31|It's not a fixed profit from Tesla.
BEAR32|Once a cars ordered that's affixed profit.
NEUT33|I don't think Tesla will ever have dealers other than the little ones for demonstrations and stuff.
NEUT34|They need to find it more upper class malls in California, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York, Boston area, etc.
BULL35|Overall, that's why I feel like Tesla is going to be successful the next 1-2 years.
NEUT36|Just building the platform.
NEUT37|For what's what's to come?
