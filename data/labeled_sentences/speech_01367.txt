NEUT0|"""Todd, with the time we have left, let's actually switch gears just a bit and talk about two privately held companies, the first of which is a company called MD Live started back in 2006."
NEUT1|Sounds very similar to me.
NEUT2|Todd like Teledoc, but as actually attracted the likes of some big name healthcare backers and partners to what's interesting for investors to keep an eye on this telemedicine that I mentioned earlier, we were talking bout teledoc that there are of the big Three.
NEUT3|Tell Roxie and that's publicly traded two more.
NEUT4|These other two that you should be keeping your eye on mdlive.
NEUT5|That's one of them, right?
NEUT6|They have about 30 million consumers that are enrolled as members because of relationships that they have with different again payers healthcare payers.
NEUT7|They expect to do about 500,000 virtual visits.
NEUT8|So that's the run rate right now.
NEUT9|500,000 virtual visits per year.
BEAR10|So smaller than this, less than what Teledoc did last quarter.
NEUT11|But still a big player in as you mentioned.
NEUT12|It's big investors in the healthcare area, especially as of this year through a new capital raise that they did include Cigna, which is a major insurer in Nova Holdings, which is the venture capital arm of Novo Nordisk, Major biopharma company.
NEUT13|Yeah, and so the other company is actually a company that's been behind Apple's Health study, a company called American Well, for those where listeners who aren't familiar with the Apple Heart study.
NEUT14|It's basically where Apple has been using an app using the Apple Watch, so wearables devices to identify irregular heart rhythms, including those from potentially serious heart conditions like atrial fibrillation.
NEUT15|And so the Apple Heart study is basically utilizing.
NEUT16|This video consultation to connect participants in this study to physicians 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
NEUT17|Let's talk a little bit more about American.
NEUT18|Well, one that I haven't really.
NEUT19|I didn't even realize was a part of this study.
NEUT20|It's gotten so much press didn't realize just how connected they were to Apple.
NEUT21|Yeah, this is another company again that you know you can't buy yourself necessarily unless you want to.
NEUT22|Like if you, if you will, is a private equity private venture.
NEUT23|And but they are raising a truckload of money, just shows how much.
NEUT24|Interest there is out there in telemedicine companies.
NEUT25|They just raised God.
NEUT26|I want to see three.
NEUT27|Yeah 366 million this summer alone and as participating in that capital raise was Phillips, which is one of the global leaders in telemedicine technology.
NEUT28|They're actually going to be joining American wells.
NEUT29|Board Anthem Health is also an investor in this company and I think one of the things that's interesting.
NEUT30|We look at MD Live an American well is to see that these insurance companies are taking these equity stakes.
NEUT31|Within these telemedicine providers, I think that's incredibly encouraging for how they view or their view is of telemedicine in the future, and how they could really change how how people get low cost care.
BULL32|Absolutely definitely a positive there just in closing.
NEUT33|Todd sounds like Tele medicine.
BULL34|Intriguing opportunity for investors if you're not already in the space, and even more intriguing value proposition for patients, everyone can agree that health care costs here in the USR.
NEUT35|Are out of control and need to be reined in.
NEUT36|Sounds like telemedicine could be just what the doctor ordered to help with that.
NEUT37|Todd, absolutely, absolutely.
NEUT38|And like most things don't go crazy with it and in your portfolio, but you know keep keep an eye on it and I think it's I think it's really exciting and 10 years from now.
NEUT39|"These companies are going to be a lot bigger than they are today."""
