NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, then I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR3|Well, a very rough day here.
BEAR4|For Apple I price gap down and then had a very very impressive balance of the upside and then the afternoon drama just shook the markets quite a bit and that didn't help.
NEUT5|The balance as everything just totally rolled back over.
NEUT6|But then I'll brings about a very critical level of support that all sorts of people are going to be watching moving forward.
NEUT7|And that's right down here at the one 2650 Mark, I mean just a quick recap of the past couple of days you can see right there?
NEUT8|Generally speaking, got around 1:26.
BULL9|Fifty did a good job bounced.
NEUT10|Earlier today.
NEUT11|Held above that level bounced and right now the price is sitting slightly up above 126 fifty, so you're going to have everybody everybody and their brother's uncle watching that level and wondering can that area continue to hold?
NEUT12|Is are the Bulls going to hold strong?
NEUT13|And while nothing is guaranteed, my core point here is this.
NEUT14|It is a more than valid.
NEUT15|It is a more than rational thought to have that you know if the price does go sideways here and then continues on down.
BEAR16|That break in and of itself could very well create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
NEUT17|Again, I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but a break at 126.
NEUT18|Fifty could very realistically, you know.
NEUT19|Just create that much more bearish than the stock, and if that level were to fail.
NEUT20|The next key level of support after that would then be down there right around the one 2450 Mark.
NEUT21|As far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT22|As of right now, it's all about that Purple line right there.
NEUT23|The 50.
NEUT24|Moving average.
BEAR25|You can see this has been a massive thorn in the side of the chart couple of times.
NEUT26|There you can see right there and then this morning right there, so you know, I'm not saying that that level can't be broken, but if there is going to be any sort of bigger turnarounds, then yeah, Public Enemy number one, by far is going to be about 50.
NEUT27|Moving average.
NEUT28|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT30|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT35|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT42|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT43|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT44|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT45|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
