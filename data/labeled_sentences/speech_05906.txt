NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol Sea C. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of weekly.
NEUT7|What make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT8|Can say up there above $1.50 now.
NEUT9|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below $1.50.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL11|That would certainly be a massive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and looking at all of this from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword certainly being moving.
BEAR15|I get the price is way up here.
NEUT16|This line is way down here, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT18|The Bulls are in full control over most.
NEUT19|Visualize that that is what is being represented again.
BULL20|Yes and above, dollar fifty would be great.
NEUT21|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT22|First level is just simply.
NEUT23|Were the party and momentum stop today and that was up there at $1.77 and then after $1.77.
NEUT24|As you're seeing here, that's basically putting the price at Blue Sky breakouts, or at least levels that have not been seen for literally months upon months.
NEUT25|So keep an eye on that level moving forward.
NEUT26|But All in all, any angle you look at it, Monster Vine today.
NEUT27|Fantastic price movement.
NEUT28|Now going into next week.
NEUT29|It's just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum?
NEUT30|Let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR39|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
