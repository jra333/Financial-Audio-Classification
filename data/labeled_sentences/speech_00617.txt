NEUT0|"""So we're right at 3800 on this Tuesday morning."
NEUT1|Obviously a lot of news to come today.
NEUT2|Let's get to Botosani morning, Bob.
BULL3|Good morning guys.
BULL4|Happy Tuesday and you're right 3800 and no follow through to the modest sell off that we got yesterday.
BEAR5|This has been characteristic the last couple of months.
NEUT6|You get one down day and nothing.
NEUT7|Next day, there's no real trend on the downside, take a look at the sectors, and today is looking a lot like the way the year so far has been shaping up with cyclical groups like energy stocks, bank stocks, leading consumer discretionary to classic cyclicals tech or flattish.
BULL8|The exception this year is Jims pointed out or semiconductor stocks they've been performing really well.
BEAR9|The rest of Tech has been slightly underperforming the overall market and offensive names like consumer staples in healthcare, generally are underperforming.
NEUT10|This has been the trend for a while.
NEUT11|As for the market, it really depends on the vaccine rollout.
BULL12|Not so great in the beginning of the year, it looks like it's getting a little bit better in terms of what's moving the markets here, thinking the buckets, vaccines and stimulus versus virus and taxes.
NEUT13|That'll be a bit down the road taxes, but that's on the horizon.
NEUT14|And of course for vaccines versus virus that's determining the pace of the recovery.
BULL15|Those vaccine rollout starting to look a little bit better after very slow rollout.
NEUT16|Other issues valuations.
BULL17|S&P 500 is more than 16% above its 200 day moving average.
BEAR18|That's really stretched.
NEUT19|Normally the SNP is about 08 or 9% above its 200 day moving average.
NEUT20|If it's bullish, this is really bullish and the yield curve we've been talking for the bank stocks, but could be an issue down the road here in terms of the leadership it's been shifting.
NEUT21|We've been noting this for the last several days now.
NEUT22|Energy banks and materials have become the leadership groups now.
BEAR23|Technology is generally flat except for semis, which have been outperforming and consumer staples and utilities have been the lagging groups.
NEUT24|It's really banks that you want to be looking at as a group.
BULL25|Banks are up 30% since the election.
BULL26|That is far outperformed.
NEUT27|What's the SNP of 11 or 12%?
BEAR28|So remember, banks underperformed all last year and they are now playing catch up.
BULL29|Look at these moves up in the big money center banks like Citigroup up 50% in JP Morgan up 34%, even the Super regional banks are all up.
BULL30|About 30% like Bank of America and PNC, those are big moves and this yield curve higher is benefiting other groups that you might not think of necessarily like the online brokers, Charles Schwab has a very significant banking operation.
BULL31|Schwab has moved up aggressively in the last few days.
BEAR32|That is a historic high for Charles Schwab that were sitting at right now Bank of America in fact upgraded them today precisely be cause of the banking operations here being positively impacted by the yield curve.
BULL33|So remember banks up about 30% and of course.
NEUT34|The issue coral for us now as we go into earnings season is banks over leadership group going into earnings season and there of course traditionally start JP Morgan will start on Friday.
NEUT35|Carl, we haven't seen this in a long long time.
BEAR36|The banks are a leadership group going into earnings season normally for recent memory they've been lagging.
NEUT37|We'll see what's going on and remember a lot of these banks even with the moves up there still relatively cheap.
NEUT38|It's a perfect setup.
NEUT39|Going into Friday start of earning season.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
