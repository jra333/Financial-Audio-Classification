BEAR0|"""I am not a big fan of calling shorts during a bull market, which we are officially still in, but Google has been something that I have been watching since 2005 since I started running my first fund and its price action this year has been less than stellar."
BEAR1|When we look at the Alibaba's in the apples of the past year, we see that Google has basically failed to take out new highs.
NEUT2|So if we acquiesce to my price theory you would see that we must take out anulo.
NEUT3|However, we are doing a contracting triangle formation in the stock right now, and the break of that triangle will tell us where we're going.
NEUT4|Let's look at the time and price symmetry for Google.
NEUT5|Here we start with the Google Monthly chart going all the way back to its opening IPO.
NEUT6|I've already drawn in the retracements for the sake of time an let's just color the retracement pullbacks.
BULL7|We had a 75% from the major retracement, which gave us a giant swing and then from the low in 08 we have a perfect 50% retracement at in the rising tops and rising bottoms line.
NEUT8|Which we know is an incorrect retracement.
NEUT9|But or jenlain which help now let's zoom into the weekly and clean up the chart.
NEUT10|Will remove the penetrated retracement lines.
NEUT11|And will put in the contracting triangle that I referenced earlier on.
NEUT12|We will also make these dotted since they are incorrect trendlines.
NEUT13|And we can see that Google has failed to take out a new high OK, so now I'm putting in some time symmetry just to illustrate a point.
NEUT14|But we can also see the perfect double bottom there and then the double top double bottoms that have led to rallies.
NEUT15|Now zooming into a daily interval, we see that we can correct the trend lines a little bit and make them more valid and then zoom in on the retracements and we see that we have deep retracements greater than 87 five at which is a deep deep shot South shallow contracting triangle.
NEUT16|We currently have this retracement from the 608 to 518 level and then we have the 518 to 568.
NEUT17|We are at the 50% of that right now.
NEUT18|And now let's add in our times.
NEUT19|So we will see some beautiful time symmetry with the 2620 seven, 28th of the month as we go forward in time, we see that beautiful double bottom there on the 28th and the 5th.
NEUT20|And then we see another 28.
NEUT21|Google has historically had great time symmetry, by the way, so if you were bored, go back and look at all the daily turns.
NEUT22|We see that the 5th and 6th and 7th of the month you know seemed to be pretty prevalent as well.
NEUT23|And actually the time symmetry is the only reason why I am not in vizing a short completely right here because we do have a potential for higher bottom a swing above.
BULL24|Five 6873 turns to train back up means off new all time highs and swing below.
NEUT25|518 means that we're going to breakdown and I'm looking at 476 if not 427 to 440.
NEUT26|Aside from that, I just like to mention that the market is not random.
BULL27|Kindle edition just broke into the top 90,000 cells on the Amazon store and it started over a million.
NEUT28|So we're doing quite well an I really hope that people go by the book at TMI and R or the market is not random.com.
BULL29|"Thank you."""
