BEAR6|Taking a look at the stock in the day the stock closed down on the day about 7 1/2 percent to close at $8.37 before the earnings report came out in the after hours and we just had the earnings report just come out and at the time of recording this right now the stock is up about 5% in the after hours.
BULL7|To $8.79.
NEUT8|So let's go ahead and take a look at the earnings report.
BULL9|The company reported their fourth quarter and 2020 year end results today and the revenues for the fourth quarter of 2020 or $4 million, which was an increase of about 43% compared to 2.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2019.
BEAR10|Revenues for the whole year for 2020 or $8.5 million, which was down from $10.1 million in 2019.
BEAR11|And the main reason for this decrease was just due to the pandemic.
BEAR12|Gross margin for the fourth quarter was 30%, which was down about 9% from 39% for the fourth quarter of 2019.
BULL13|Gross margins for the year 2020 as a whole or 33%, which was pretty consistent with 2019 results.
BULL14|So we did have a slight beat on earnings, which is great.
NEUT15|You can go check out the report if you want to get more in depth view of it, especially for breakdown the individual expenses.
BULL16|But we did also get some comments from the CEO, but I also want to cover the CEO said 2020 was an important momentum building year for Bionano and one that allowed us to showcase many of our strengths.
BULL17|Despite 2020 challenges, we executed well in our commercial offerings for Sapphire by expanding the number of systems in the field and the number of samples.
BULL18|Analyzing our data services lab, we believe this progress helped create the awareness needed to develop the market for structural variation analysis and optical genome mapping.
BULL19|Further, in our goal of disrupting the genome Industry, 2021 is shaping up to be a transformational year for the company's.
BULL20|Overall, we're going to be on earnings and some good comments from the CEO that give us an update on the status of the company.
NEUT21|So now on to the price predictions for the stock.
NEUT22|My prediction for BNG oh by the end of the year is for the stock to reach $20.
BULL23|However I do think there's a good chance we could see $25 or higher but I'm confident now seeing $20 on the low side.
NEUT24|Now of course, this is just my personal price prediction.
NEUT25|For this talk, I do think it go much higher, but I personally like to have more conservative price targets on stuff.
BULL26|So overall we got good news for the stock in the company overall and once we start getting some more consistent green days, I expect the stock to start steadily climbing again.
NEUT27|But what do you guys think?
