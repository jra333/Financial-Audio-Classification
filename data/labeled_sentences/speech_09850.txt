NEUT0|"""Alright guys, this report will back into video."
NEUT1|See how we talking about you.
NEUT2|WMC stock, previously known as GHIV stock and I'll be giving you guys some analysts going forward so.
NEUT3|They did announce it was their record fourth quarter and four year 2020 results right 1.37 billion net income and their declaring their first quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, right?
NEUT4|So companies that are profitable pay you dividends.
BULL5|OK, so that is a very good sign.
NEUT6|And also their loan volume 'cause their mortgage company for loan volume.
NEUT7|Plus 57.7 billion which is 71%.
NEUT8|Year over year profit, right?
BULL9|So there's 71% profit than last year.
BULL10|So that is very good comfort.
BULL11|A company like I said today was a good catalyst.
NEUT12|That's why I was still holding.
NEUT13|No matter how low in job I was going to hold this long term.
NEUT14|And as you can see is creating that nice little you an starting to go higher.
BULL15|So if it broke this level that was very bullish for me and it did.
NEUT16|So I'm I'm holding this stock for the long term.
NEUT17|Honestly, I will keep adding shares to the long term 'cause I think.
BEAR18|Below $1312.00 is a steal fallacy like if it comes below $11.00 again, I'll probably get some more shares.
NEUT19|And around $12.00 I get more shares, but once it starts going to like 1314 fifteen I would just hold the position.
NEUT20|And I'll also be planted intraday, so I'll be like say I would get in here and I would get out here.
NEUT21|That's like intraday move that I'll be doing, but I'll be still holding long term shares for the longer run 'cause this company is the number one in USA.
NEUT22|OK so like I said you guys want to hold these shares.
BULL23|The stock was going to come back up and as you can see it is coming back up so we broke through this level and now I see a level.
NEUT24|Right around here.
BULL25|At this level, and as you can see, it kind of bottomed out to here and now is breaking above and it tested it again and after market, so I think tomorrow we will see a good day.
BULL26|It is up aftermarket.
NEUT27|So like I said just hold, hold, hold these shares.
BULL28|OK so hope you guys like the video.
NEUT29|None of us are recommendation bar so anything is for educational purposes only.
NEUT30|"Do not trade anything you see here in this video and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
