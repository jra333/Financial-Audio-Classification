NEUT0|"""I'm Stuart Watson from The Motley Fool here today to talk about AIM shares in Icec."
NEUT1|Now the Chancellor George Osborne said in the autumn statement this week that he was going to consult on allowing AIM shares in Isas, which caused quite a bit of interest in our discussion boards here at The Motley Fool.
NEUT2|A few different tax rates you can get already get at the moment frame shares.
NEUT3|There's about 1000 shares online, but if a company is also listed on another main market, for example, say Australia or in Toronto, which quite a few sort of oil and gas and mining shares are because they do listed and you can actually put them in a nicer and I think there's about 70 or so companies that qualify for that.
NEUT4|At the moment.
NEUT5|There's also another relief which relates to inheritance tax, called business property Relief.
NEUT6|As well, I think 100 or so companies would qualify for that at the moment, so here it's if it's a trading company so not particularly related to it's a property or investment, and it mostly does its business in the UK, then it might qualify for that relief.
NEUT7|So if you hold those shares for two years then they sort of come out of your state for inheritance tax.
NEUT8|So quite a few people use that for inheritance tax tax planning now what will happen here?
NEUT9|We're not quite sure going forward, so if the Chancellor says yes, you can put all these same shares a nice is.
BEAR10|It may mean that we lose that inheritance tax relief as well.
NEUT11|So that's one thing we gotta watch out for, and it's only a consultation at the moment, so we don't know about timescales.
NEUT12|These things don't tend to move too quickly, so I mean it could be perhaps the year after next, so maybe from April 2014 that we see this happening.
NEUT13|It's definitely something to keep an eye on.
BULL14|"We will like our tax relief, so we'll see what happens."""
