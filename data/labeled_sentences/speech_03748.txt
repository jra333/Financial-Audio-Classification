BEAR0|"""Well, it has been a turbulent year on the stock market."
BULL1|Let's look at the incredible rise of the Essex over the past year.
BEAR2|March quarter results for 2020 were dismal down 24% a year on.
BULL3|Though it's up 3% for the quarter, that is a rise of 16% since the beginning of the financial year and a 33% rise over the past 12 months.
NEUT4|Quite incredible weekend Sunrise money man Scott Phillips joins us now.
BULL5|Scotty good morning to you really impressive these results.
BULL6|I guess we were hoping that it would bounce back.
BULL7|Yeah, hoping and expecting that good morning.
NEUT8|This is really the story of the recovery from that big Covid crash and we set it at the time we've said it ever since.
NEUT9|Keep your nerve, don't panic, don't selbie cause the markets always come back to those previous highs.
NEUT10|Literally every single time we've added a line like this.
NEUT11|Sometimes it takes longer than other times.
NEUT12|This time it's been.
BULL13|I mean look this train economy roaring back, the stock market coming back as well should have been expected.
NEUT14|This quickly quite frankly, but but really happy to see it.
BULL15|And again with the economy recovering so nicely.
BULL16|It's a win for everybody and not a bad return 33% if you if you made the call back then the Reserve Bank meets on Tuesday.
NEUT17|It is stated already that there won't be a rate rise really on the cards until what 2020 324?
NEUT18|But I know you actually looked really drilled down into what they said and there is an option open to them to lift them if they like.
NEUT19|Yeah that would be a little bit careful here.
NEUT20|So the bank said there are certain conditions and they don't see those conditions until twenty 2324.
NEUT21|But those conditions happen earlier, they will go earlier so I've never actually said.
NEUT22|We're not going till then there.
BULL23|So we want wages to go up and we want inflation to come back when that happens in a sustained way.
NEUT24|Don't put rates up now their forecast is 2020 three 24.
NEUT25|They may be right, but if it comes early they will move early and it's important to remember that when we think about where rates might go now, do you think it'll be sooner than that?
NEUT26|I do.
NEUT27|Actually.
BULL28|Yeah, I think I think if the economy continues to improve here and around the world, the growth in the economy we are seeing some price inflation come back already.
BEAR29|Wages growth is slow, but any point rates going down really fast.
BEAR30|If that continues, that should put upward pressure on wages would be good for all of us.
BULL31|And possibly the bad news if your mortgage Holder is rates might go up as well as he seemed to really love the fixed rate.
NEUT32|At the moment they've been looking at in in record numbers, snapping up fixed rate home loans.
BULL33|While it is, it's a record rate.
BULL34|That's an extraordinary growth.
NEUT35|Isn't look, it just makes it.
NEUT36|Makes Officer we've been saying for the longest time, I've always said, look, it probably won't matter which way you go in the last 6 to 12 months, I've changed my tune, specifically because rates are so incredibly low.
NEUT37|Heads you win, tails you don't lose much if you're looking alright guys, little bit lower.
BULL38|You still looking fantastic, right?
NEUT39|We've got a little bit like he missed a little bit, but friends do copper than you expect as we just talked about you sort of that low rate locked in so it very much is you kind of can't lose by locking in.
NEUT40|Yeah you might.
NEUT41|Yeah it'll change the way they change.
NEUT42|But as I said tails, you don't lose much.
BULL43|It's a pretty good outcome.
NEUT44|Everyones taking your advice Scotty, hopefully they are.
NEUT45|That's a good thing that they are.
NEUT46|They are new figures out this week revealed job ads.
NEUT47|I want to just talk briefly about this up 10% but the the detail here is incredible.
BULL48|There up two point 2% in capital cities that's compared with would you believe 39.7% in the regions?
BULL49|That's astonishing is remarkable, isn't so a really good result.
BULL50|Temps in across the board is excellent.
NEUT51|Unfortunately, capital cities.
NEUT52|We know that retail trades going back very very slowly.
BEAR53|The CBD's are suffering the outer suburbs.
BULL54|The regions are doing incredibly well right now.
BULL55|40% increase in rates.
NEUT56|Sorry in jobs, think about Central and North QLD, Bendigo, Ballarat, Northwestern WA.
NEUT57|Really right across the country.
NEUT58|Regional areas.
BEAR59|Absolutely booming house prices jobs.
BULL60|It is good news to be in the regions and they need all that help too.
BULL61|"Alright Scotty, thank you very much for your thoughts as always."""
