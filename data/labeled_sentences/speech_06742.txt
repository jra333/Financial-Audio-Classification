NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for February 20th, 2018 and Christina Barton, new investment analyst that exam.com and they were going to look at the US dollar versus the Japanese yen, the daily chart."
BULL1|So the lion has been gaining momentum the last two days after it reached a 15 month low of 105.54 on Friday, breaking a key support of 107.31.
BEAR2|There are side was below 30 in Stochastics were under 20 both in.
BEAR3|Oversold areas.
BULL4|Therefore we saw prices bouncing higher.
BEAR5|However we can see that these games were not enough to change the bearish sentiment that market maintains a bearish pattern.
BEAR6|More obviously, since early January an prices are still below the McLeod and the moving average lines which are currently negatively sloped.
BULL7|However, in the short term we might see dollar in rising a little bit because if you look again at the stochastics those are turning higher.
BEAR8|And their site is getting upwards, but it's still below 50 in bearish territory.
BEAR9|So if prices continue to extend higher, the market could find resistance at 107.31 which will support back in early September.
BULL10|Then from here prices could immediately meet the 23.6% people Nachi of the downlink from 113.74 to 105.54.
NEUT11|This is at 107.45.
BULL12|Further, above 38.2% people not she could be a stronger obstacle to breakthrough because the area has been frequently tested the last couple of weeks and the 20 day moving average is also located in this area are therefore if the market manage is to close above this area, I will probably see resistance running towards the 50% Fibonacci of 109.61.
BULL13|On the other hand, if the market weekends is that prices could move back to 105 point.
BULL14|4054, which you've broken up with increase negative momentum towards the 104 key level.
NEUT15|Looking out the medium term picture.
NEUT16|The outlook is bearish.
NEUT17|Given that prices hold below the 50 day moving average which was crossed below, the longer time frame.
NEUT18|200 day moving average on February 6th and shows no sign of changing direction direction such as things that further downside movements are more likely to emerge.
NEUT19|Uhm?
BEAR20|Market over here also shows that Dollar Yen could be under pressure as the index continues to fluctuate well below 0, so that's all for me.
BULL21|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
