NEUT0|"""To understand where we go, we have to understand the yield move today."
NEUT1|Do you see this lower yield move as sustainable or is this a blip?
NEUT2|I think it's a blip you're probably going to see the yields going a little bit higher, but you must remember these yields are still very very low on a historical basis, so I don't think there's a direct relationship between higher yields and maybe a lower market or higher market.
NEUT3|You can look at the historical record and there's no clear correlation, so I'm not too worried about that.
BEAR4|It's already having a pretty big impact on EM.
BULL5|Mark will come to that a little bit later, and we're also seeing a pretty big impact on tech that is bouncing back.
NEUT6|How high, though do you think the US yield can get without having an impact?
BULL7|Broadly on markets people are talking about getting up to 2%.
NEUT8|Do you see that?
NEUT9|Do you see us going further?
NEUT10|No, I don't see that.
NEUT11|I see maybe 1.6% and that's I think already in the market.
NEUT12|I think people are already expecting that, so I think it's already discounted in the prices.
NEUT13|What areas, though, are most vulnerable?
NEUT14|I mean the Fed keeps talking about if financial conditions are tight and then they'll do something about it.
BULL15|So far so good.
NEUT16|What areas have you notice have started to feel some kind of potential tightening?
BEAR17|The real problem is in the tech sector.
BEAR18|Basically, those companies that have no earnings and that have been pushed up dramatically and one of the things I fear is that leader, not a decline of the Bitcoin price.
NEUT19|I think the relationship between Bitcoin prices and the tech market is very close, so watch that indicator.
BEAR20|I think Bitcoin prices go down.
BEAR21|I think the Texas are going to be hit very badly.
NEUT22|You bring up Bitcoin.
NEUT23|Let's talk about gold.
BEAR24|Gold has been under pressure.
BULL25|Mark outflows from ETF's absolutely massive.
NEUT26|What do you think you added to your position?
BULL27|I remember last time we spoke, you were pretty comfortable with your position.
BEAR28|Prices have come down since then.
NEUT29|What are you doing right now?
NEUT30|Right now I'm holding on to the gold causes come down.
NEUT31|It's quite amazing.
NEUT32|I think there again is a relationship between the Bitcoin and go because you talk to all these people and they say, Gee, Bitcoin is like gold.
NEUT33|It's a.
NEUT34|It's a store value, so I think there's some relationship between these two and one of the reasons why gold is down.
NEUT35|Otherwise there's no good reason why goal should be down at this stage, yeah, but Mark Bitcoins moving with tech, it's moving with momentum.
BEAR36|Exactly, but it's come down as you know, it's been pretty volatile.
BULL37|Hopefully it stays up.
NEUT38|I'm not.
NEUT39|I'm not predicting or wishing that it goes down, but I just hope it stays up because tech stocks.
BULL40|Then we'll be able to revive.
BEAR41|"As you know, some of these tech stocks, like Tencent and others, have come down substantially, so we've got to watch that carefully."""
