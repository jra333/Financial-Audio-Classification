NEUT0|"""Charlemagne get on the show quite a bit, and one of these I love having you on is your swing to speak openly about something that's often cover up so you're you're in South Carolina."
NEUT1|You wrote about this all to share with everybody.
NEUT2|Tide up and drugs loving family, but it's not quite.
NEUT3|How you portray a typical childhood?
NEUT4|When did you realize this?
NEUT5|One normal that this wasn't going to be good for you long term?
NEUT6|Actually, I didn't realize it wasn't normal till about 3-4 years ago, but I first got diagnosed with anxiety in like 2010.
NEUT7|But prior to that I was having panic attacks my whole life.
NEUT8|But because of the environment that I was in, a lot of the things that I was into, I thought that the paranoia that comes with that you know the the anxiousness that I feel with that always feeling like I'm about to have a heart attack.
NEUT9|This shortness of breath I thought all of that stuff was normal but I'm a radio personality so when I got fired from the fourth time in radio this was 2010.
NEUT10|I was 31 years old.
NEUT11|I was back living at home with my mom.
NEUT12|My daughter was like 1 years old.
NEUT13|My now wife is back living at home with her parents.
BEAR14|I was collecting unemployment checks and I felt like I was having the biggest heart attack on my life.
NEUT15|One day driving down I-26 right and in South Carolina, number pulling over to the side of the road.
NEUT16|So I'm gonna go to the Doctor tomorrow.
NEUT17|I go to the doctor.
NEUT18|The doctor tells me the same thing.
NEUT19|They always tell me whenever I used to go for these heart palpitations like you have athletes heart, your heart is fine.
NEUT20|He was like do you?
NEUT21|Do you suffer from anxiety?
NEUT22|It's like you had a panic attack and I was like anxiety.
NEUT23|A panic attack.
NEUT24|What is that?
BEAR25|And he was like, well, you stressed out about anything and I was like hell yeah, I'm stressed out about a lot of stuff, you know.
NEUT26|So in my mind, once again I just.
NEUT27|I just checked it off with something as you know, what?
NEUT28|All I gotta do is get another job once I get another job, everything will be fine, but then you know you get the job and you know your life is going good 3-4 years later and you're still wondering why you're having these feelings, why you still have this anxiousness?
NEUT29|Why you still having these panic attacks?
NEUT30|You know why do you still feel like something is wrong with your heart?
NEUT31|You think that a success and the money is just going to make these things go away?
NEUT32|But it doesn't.
NEUT33|So that's when I decided to start, you know, actually, going to a therapist and trying to get a handle on this.
NEUT34|This anxiety thing.
NEUT35|So when I say I didn't realize that I was actually having issues until three or four years ago, that's what I meant when I started going to therapy, showing you speak about working out, but sometimes you have to work it out right with therapy?
NEUT36|Yeah, that's why I called it in investing in your mental mental wealth, you know, I feel like that you know you have to.
NEUT37|Actually, take steps to figure out what's going inside your mind, but a lot of times we don't have the tools you don't have the resources and we don't have the information you know.
NEUT38|I just think especially growing up, you know, in a community like I grew up in, my father had been dealing with mental health issues all his life.
NEUT39|I never found that out until last year, and I didn't find that out until he heard me talking about it in my book, and when I had a cousin who committed suicide after trying to kill himself, you know four different times.
NEUT40|That's when my father finally came to me and said to me, hey man, I know I tried 10 to 12 different medications throughout my life, and I've been going to see a therapist two or three times a week and I tried to kill myself.
NEUT41|30 years ago and I remember going to my mom, saying your mom, you know pops was dealing with all of this and she was like I just thought he was playing crazy to get a check and he he he did.
NEUT42|Eventually you know end up getting the check because they didn't have anything else to do.
NEUT43|They don't know what else to do but throw money at him so it's like when you don't have the tools and you don't have the resources.
NEUT44|"Who am I supposed to talk to when I'm dealing with issues you know?"""
