NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's November 11th, 2016.
NEUT2|I'm Celina, Nicholas technical analyst at xm.com and today we'll look at the euro versus the pound Sterling on the daily chart.
NEUT3|So the neutral bias that Euro GBP held recently is now shifted to more bearish bias after prices broke out of this one month range of Zero Point 8880 and point.
BEAR4|9050 we saw prices fall sharply on Wednesday with the key support level of point 8880 giving way, and this led to an acceleration in the decline of Euro GBP.
BEAR5|It's fallen for a third consecutive day.
BEAR6|Today, our sites well below 50.
BEAR7|It's now in bearish territory trending down.
BEAR8|This indicates a probability of a further decline in prices, although as it approaches.
BEAR9|Oversold levels near 30.
BULL10|There could be some consolidation in the market now if we look at the 200 day moving average it's providing support.
NEUT11|It's acting as support around Zero Point 8620 or see prices or no on this level.
NEUT12|Next support lies at Zero Point 8531 and this is actually a Fitbit Nachi level, it's a 78.6 retracement level of the rise from point 8332.
NEUT13|Two point 9261.
BEAR14|A break below the support level would target the September low.
BEAR15|The point 8332 low.
BULL16|Now the market would actually have to rise above point 9050 to bring back the bullish move at a curd from this September October move.
BULL17|That rally from Point 8332, Point 9261.
BULL18|So if prices can move above at least .90, we could see a reversal in this current bearish bias.
NEUT19|That is forming now.
BULL20|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
