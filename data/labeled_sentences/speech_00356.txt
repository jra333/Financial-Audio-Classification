BULL0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the S&P 500 and as you can see we have pulled bank event only to turn around and show signs of strength."
NEUT1|At this point I think the 4000 level above continues to be.
NEUT2|A major.
BEAR3|Resistance barrier I think at this point if we can break above it then you know will continue the next leg higher, probably 4100, but I think it's going to be very noisy.
BEAR4|Jerome Powell speaking over the next couple of days could cause some issues as well.
NEUT5|I'm looking to buy dips all the way to like 3700 and breakdown below.
NEUT6|There would have me buying puts for some type of flash crash because we're bout to.
BEAR7|It's been like a year at this point.
NEUT8|3900 Thirty 850 AMA.
NEUT9|"They all offer opportunities."""
