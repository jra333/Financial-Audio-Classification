BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This be a video chart on ticker symbol EYES.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, quite the eventful day on this one an you know, just I'm not beat around the Bush.
NEUT6|I realize I'm saying the obvious just a Savage Savage day.
NEUT7|I mean things were looking beautiful.
NEUT8|Got the breakout right there, price started to run, run, run, little bit of consolidation and then sure I mean nothing can go straight up but just to have that plunge.
NEUT9|Just a brutal day and now suddenly levels that seem crazy to think could be relevant earlier on in the day are actually very very relevant moving into Friday and that first level now that has become very relevant from the sports out of things.
BULL10|Is down here on $12.40, which if you go through the history you can see 1240 did a good job of providing support there and support there now.
NEUT11|That doesn't mean that the price is going for sure hit 1240.
NEUT12|I'm just saying that it makes sense given the amount of you know you know excuse me downwards momentum that showed up.
NEUT13|But yeah it very well could be now headed down at 12:40 so if the price does go down to that area, that's where the big question mark resides is can the price even can that level slow down the price?
BULL14|Or if the price gets on there and continues on down that would just be further confirmation that you know that the Bears are not only still in control but the Bears are gaining that much more strength and momentum.
NEUT15|So definitely keep a close eye on that an now if the price does all of a sudden started, work back upwards, which I mean I don't think anybody would be shocked by given just how crazy I would move to the downside.
NEUT16|But if the price does try to work its way back upwards, that first key battleground now going to be right there at 1585.
NEUT17|So keep a very close eye on that.
NEUT18|And if the price can get about 1585, well then at that point.
BULL19|And start to make a little bit more sense to say that you know maybe the price is going to try to make another move back up to these highs, but as of right now $17.00 and above.
NEUT20|I think it is doesn't make any sense at all.
BEAR21|It took to question if the pricing get back above there as long as the price is still down below that 1585 mark.
NEUT22|But yeah, rough day today but still one day left on the week.
NEUT23|So we'll see if the price can try to maybe get things turned around or not on Friday 1st off.
BULL24|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT26|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL27|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT28|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT29|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR30|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT33|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT34|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT35|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT36|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT37|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT38|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT39|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
