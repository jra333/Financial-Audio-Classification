BULL0|"""It was good."
NEUT1|Family was good man.
BULL2|Hopefully everybody had a blessed weekend.
NEUT3|The markets were closed for Good Friday and I try to make every Friday Good Friday.
NEUT4|You hear me so you know again.
NEUT5|Yesterday it was some quality Easter, some call it resurrection Sunday.
NEUT6|Man, there's a lot of times where we need to.
NEUT7|We need a resurrection, right?
NEUT8|We gotta speak life into situations that are dead, and, you know, it says that we can speak life into things man.
NEUT9|So make sure you resurrected.
NEUT10|Yourself man speaking life into yourself, bringing things back from the dead.
NEUT11|You know what I mean.
NEUT12|So anyways, family Speaking of something that's looking dead right now.
NEUT13|Castor maritime.
NEUT14|But again, I think there's an opportunity for resurrection, right?
NEUT15|If we know and were informed, then we can make sound decisions on what we're doing.
NEUT16|So with Castor maritime you know I was in this play for awhile.
NEUT17|I think I was in.
NEUT18|It was in the 40s, went back up we gotta wait till like $1.90 came back down you know so I had sold.
NEUT19|I think last week.
NEUT20|Around.
NEUT21|Around $0.80.
NEUT22|Now.
BEAR23|What happened today to make it drop 20% again, you guys skews the background noise meant by nine to five man.
NEUT24|One day I won't have to do that.
NEUT25|So yeah, So what happened family?
NEUT26|There was a direct offering.
NEUT27|OK, So what happens in a direct offering?
NEUT28|You have a company that's selling so many shares with Castor maritime.
NEUT29|It says up to 192,000,000.
NEUT30|Common shares at a price of point $0.65.
NEUT31|So basically they're going to sell these shares too.
BEAR32|Commercial investors at a lower price than what the share was at, which is $0.65.
NEUT33|So when that happens, a lot of times you will find that the stocks.
BEAR34|Price will drop close to the $0.65 or a little below it, so for me this is a buying opportunity.
BEAR35|It went under the $0.65 is down to $0.58 so you gotta think there's.
NEUT36|Commercial investors that are buying these shares at $0.65, so we should at least see it get past that.
NEUT37|Also, let's not forget what they've been doing.
NEUT38|Remember, they just purchased another tanker family so they just added this, which is guaranteed money.
NEUT39|You can read this article.
NEUT40|It pretty much says they have a minimum gross higher of $15,000 per day with this new vessel that they've acquired.
NEUT41|You know so.
NEUT42|Easy, looks like easy money to me.
NEUT43|Again, I'm not a financial advisor family, but you know, just something to look into.
BULL44|I established another position here.
NEUT45|I'll sit for awhile so you guys know what it is.
NEUT46|"Fam bam let's eat."""
