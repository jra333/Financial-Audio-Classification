NEUT0|"""Well, we all know if you watched the movie Wolf of Wall Street, the story of Jordan Belford, and the fortune he made in Penny stock."
NEUT1|Well, it turns out there's a new Wolf of Wall Street in town, though he's never worked on Wall Street.
NEUT2|Josh Sesson is 27 years old.
NEUT3|Invested $200 million in penny stocks himself and paying bets.
NEUT4|Bloomberg Zeke Fox joins me now.
NEUT5|Great article zeke.
NEUT6|In Bloomberg Business Week on this.
NEUT7|So what do we know about this?
NEUT8|27 year old millionaire who is what six years ago?
NEUT9|Living with his parents in Long Island?
NEUT10|Yes.
NEUT11|He was in a band, hoping to be a rock star when he learned this one weird legal trick that lets you make huge returns on penny stocks, which are usually a horrible investment right, and?
NEUT12|The way that it works is he instead of just buying the stock loans companies money and then gets in return.
NEUT13|1,000,000 or even billions of shares at a big discount to the market price.
NEUT14|He said the loans convert into stock.
NEUT15|Then yes, at a huge discount price.
NEUT16|So what happens if those companies go bankrupt or they go to zero?
NEUT17|What happens then?
NEUT18|It doesn't matter how low the companies go, as long as there's a market for the shares.
NEUT19|If the stock goes to a penny, he gets it for say, half a penny.
NEUT20|If it goes to the thousandth of a penny, gets it for half a thousandth of a penny, so he can always make money in less.
NEUT21|The market totally dries up, right?
NEUT22|Right?
NEUT23|Exactly then, he.
NEUT24|Then he's out of luck.
NEUT25|So tell me a little bit about this guy.
NEUT26|I mean, as I mentioned so six years ago he was living with his parents on the way and what?
NEUT27|What is he like now?
NEUT28|I mean, you know just how does he spend his money?
NEUT29|Where is he investing?
NEUT30|He's sort of like a mini Richard Branson.
NEUT31|He's producing a movie with Martin Scorsese called Bleed for this starring Miles Teller.
NEUT32|It's a boxing biopic.
NEUT33|OK, then he's in London.
NEUT34|He's mixing an album by this Israeli model.
NEUT35|He signed his record label he's got.
NEUT36|The sort of Kickstarter that helps bands sell albums ahead of time.
NEUT37|He's got a receptionist company.
NEUT38|He's doing all sorts of different things.
NEUT39|He's really diversified away from this penny stock thing, which is where he made his fortune so he doesn't.
NEUT40|Does he like those comparisons to Jordan Belford?
NEUT41|He actually doesn't like that.
NEUT42|No, and I think that's a little mean.
NEUT43|Belfort would actually, you know, the basis for the Wolf of Wall Street.
NEUT44|He's calling old people and tricking them into buying worthless stocks and basically stealing their money.
NEUT45|So someone's come up with this legal trick to finance desperate penny stock companies that enables him to make big profits but doesn't actually involve.
NEUT46|Going out and tricking retiring then pops right, exactly Anan, manipulating them.
NEUT47|OK, so if this is something that is very lucrative an it's legal.
NEUT48|So why doesn't every hedge fund do this then?
NEUT49|Well, there's a limit to how much you can scale it up, because these are tiny companies, so he's doing these investments.
NEUT50|Generally 100,000 or million at a time.
NEUT51|The other thing is that it is pretty sketchy.
BEAR52|A lot of the companies that do what Sesson has done have gotten sued by the SEC one.
BEAR53|Guy who did it actually got arrested by the FBI because they took shortcuts.
NEUT54|There's a way to do it legally, but there's it's easy to maybe get into get into some legal trouble dude.
BEAR55|Yeah, the it's a pretty Gray area and it's hard to know exactly what's right and what's wrong, so most people don't want to go there.
NEUT56|And also maybe they never knew that there were such big money to be made right?
NEUT57|Exactly alright, Z.
BULL58|"Thank you so much on that on Josh Sesson, Bloomberg, Zeke, Fox."""
