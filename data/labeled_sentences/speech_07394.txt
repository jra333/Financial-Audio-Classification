NEUT14|To watch from the beginning, just click on the link down below in the description.
NEUT15|Gilead Sciences of Bio Pharm company.
NEUT16|They have tons of different medicines, treatment medicines that they've developed and commercialized for the HIV virus.
NEUT17|There's a ton of things that they're doing now in the news.
NEUT18|One of the stocks I would say is worth a little research on your behalf, but I do like this stack if you want my personal opinion.
NEUT19|We've got a price target on this at 80 bucks a share.
NEUT20|They are making money earnings per share at $0.10 PE of 678.
NEUT21|Now let's look at the technicals on this.
NEUT22|Looking at the long term chart, I see 85.
NEUT23|And the top end and on the bottom end this stack really likes 6250 as a support.
NEUT24|Now I put a buy target on this at 65, so I want to get a little closer and show you what, where and why that is.
BEAR25|I we saw a gap up and now a little profit taking happening.
NEUT26|I want to see a buy right here at 65.
NEUT27|To 6550, a share somewhere in here.
NEUT28|I'll even take 66 anywhere between 65 to 66 was a price target of 80.
NEUT29|That's 15 points on your money.
NEUT30|Not too shabby.
NEUT31|I'll take it.
