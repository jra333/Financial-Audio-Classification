NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|We've been tracking this on a very routine basis, so that is where the red and green line notations were coming from.
NEUT5|But as we head into Friday here what I want to do here 'cause I'm very curious about this dynamic an whether or not it means anything.
NEUT6|It may not, but caught my eye and I'm very curious.
NEUT7|Like I said, does this represent any sort of strength or today?
NEUT8|And the dynamic here is?
BEAR9|This red line here has been a very very stubborn level.
BEAR10|I mean, you can just see over the course of the past few days whenever the price has gone up around that level, it just continually rejects, it, rejects it, reject 6 until late day today you can see the price finally got above it.
NEUT11|And not only that, but continue to separate to the upside.
NEUT12|So the big question I have going into Friday's hey is this the start of something bigger?
NEUT13|Now?
NEUT14|Don't get me wrong and I wish I could say train with this easy just because that red line was broken does not mean that for sure.
NEUT15|Guaranteed a bigger movement is going to occur, but my point here is.
NEUT16|It's at least a valid.
NEUT17|It's at least a rational thought to be now wondering.
NEUT18|Hey, maybe something bigger is getting ready to take place.
NEUT19|Case in point, let's just say that the price actually got rejected and just went back down.
NEUT20|And then I was sitting here saying hey, it's looking like something is going to, you know something could get bigger.
NEUT21|He'd like what are you talking about?
NEUT22|The price got rejected to the downside, but in this situation, right?
NEUT23|That didn't happen.
BULL24|The price broke that red line, so let's see if the price can start to show some strength.
NEUT25|And the biggest sign of strength is just simply showing that it's not going to go back to where it was meaning.
NEUT26|And This is why, in my opinion at least.
NEUT27|120 is very important because if the price comes down to 120 and then falls blow up without all of a sudden be putting the price right back to where it was.
NEUT28|Or in other words that would be put in the price back below that trendline, which would be the exact opposite of a true trendline break.
NEUT29|So that's how 120 can be helpful from one angle, then the other angles will just if the price continues to work its way up higher.
NEUT30|So that would be in the form of Canada price now.
NEUT31|Break up above that purple line there, which on my chart you know it's a very famous 50 per day moving average, currently valued at 121.
NEUT32|We'll call it 75.
NEUT33|So like I said.
BEAR34|Trendline break has hot happened.
NEUT35|Not just a question of can the price build upon it and get some more momentum?
NEUT36|Let's see what happens with it.
NEUT37|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT38|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT39|But it will be me.
NEUT40|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL41|Going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT42|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT43|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR44|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT47|And I'll show you.
NEUT48|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
