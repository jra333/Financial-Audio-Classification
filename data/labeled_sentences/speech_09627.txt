NEUT0|"""Well, Scott I don't know I ran a subscription business for 26 years."
NEUT1|And when I saw churn that your turn would take up to 42%.
NEUT2|What that said to me was you gonna lose everybody in three years and I knew that when the company.
BEAR3|Iran had churned that was anywhere near the 30s that I was doing a not good job and would have to disclose it to shareholders, which caused the stock of the street, which I'm talking bout to plummet?
NEUT4|How do you I do believe that 42 percent is too high Sir?
NEUT5|Having come from the business that you're in, I know that's not a good number.
NEUT6|What can be done to bring it down?
NEUT7|So Jim, I completely agree.
NEUT8|You know, I've been in subscription businesses also and it's absolutely critical that you retain your customers.
NEUT9|You know, senior switch their plans because they can get into a better plan, right?
NEUT10|And that's part of our business models to make certain number one that we have seniors in the very best plan that gives him the coverage they need at the economic cost that they can afford.
NEUT11|So that will always be our North Star and we will build our business model around it.
NEUT12|When we saw churn tick up in.
BULL13|Late in the second quarter, we jumped on it.
BULL14|We were fortunate that we were working with activate.
NEUT15|You know, I know, Strauss Zelnick is mentioned activation you're solving for him on your show and we put them on this and my original concern was, you know how much of this churn is caused by these market dynamics.
BEAR16|You know factors outside our control activate came back and said 90% of the churn is due to our own actions or inactions.
NEUT17|Really.
NEUT18|So we've already taken the steps that activate recommended, which is.
BULL19|The three things one we're hiring, more internal agents, increasing our mix of internal agents versus external agents.
BULL20|Secondly, we aligned our agent compensation to reward them for retaining our members.
BEAR21|And 3rd, we formed a retention team, and on this one we were slow.
NEUT22|Our competitors have had retention teams for several years, right?
BULL23|And I fully admit we were focused on growth.
BULL24|We grew 88% last year, capturing market share, helping more seniors.
NEUT25|We really feel passionate about that and maybe we needed to focus more on retention.
BULL26|We saw that kick up.
BEAR27|There's no question if the if the churn continued to escalate, it would undermine our business model, right?
NEUT28|So we take it because we've taken it very seriously.
