NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|I'm Celina necklace technical analyst.
BEAR2|Wrexham.com today is Tuesday, April 11th and will look at Euro yen on the daily chart so we can see that Euro JPY closed below the 200 day moving average for a second day yesterday.
BEAR3|And currently it's extending losses today.
BULL4|The pair had been trading above the 200 day moving average for the past five months.
BEAR5|Since March, the March 13 I 122.87 euro JPY has dropped by 4.8%.
BEAR6|If we look at the RSI indicator, it is now below 30, so it's an oversold territory.
BULL7|So downside bias is quite strong, but even though it's reached oversold levels, it appears that you will.
BEAR8|JPY still has some more downside to go.
BEAR9|If we look at my deeds below 0 trending down, it's also supporting the bearish outlook.
BULL10|The market is now retraced more than half of a recent uptrend from the 112 area, but up to 124, so that was rise from September to December.
BEAR11|Since then the market pause this rally and it's it's been heading lower in the past months.
NEUT12|There scope for.
BULL13|Prices to reach the 61.8 fibbonaci.
NEUT14|That level comes in at 116 point 64 hour break.
BEAR15|Below this level would risk a deeper decline all the way towards 112 level so only a bounce back above 118 at least the 118 level, which is a 50% from Nachi this week, and current downtrend and bring the pair back to more neutral bias but sustained trading below the 200 day moving average and also.
BEAR16|Below, the Ichimoku cloud would likely maintain the current bearish outlook.
BULL17|Thanks so much for watching.
BULL18|"Have a great day."""
