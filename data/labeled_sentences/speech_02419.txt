BEAR5|Yesterday brought the premiere of season two of the Mandalorian is flagship original content offering for Disney, plus timely since the second season wrapped shooting just before Hollywood Lockdown productions and it faces content competition from rivals that has been watered down by those shutdowns.
BULL6|But as Dan Gallagher notes, the Star Wars series may represent a tipping point toward a future where the studio behind some of Hollywood's biggest ever draws, including Star Wars, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, expand on Indiana Jones, not to mention beloved.
NEUT7|Disney branded Family Fare reinsurers itself on streaming rather than the cinema.
NEUT8|That view is backed up by Disney's recent reorganization that in trenches power in a new distribution organization to determine where is recent or where its content ends up, and that group will favor streaming as primary focus.
NEUT9|Disney had signals such a move, Gallagher notes even before Third Point activist investor Dan Loeb urged the company not to bring back its dividend.
NEUT10|And redirect that cash and his blockbuster is still streaming each streaming release like the Mandalorian Season 2 is another data point along a potential path where theaters play are smaller role upcoming catalysts in that area could include November 12 earnings and a December 10th Analyst Meeting, both coming right around the one year anniversary of Disney Plus launch.
