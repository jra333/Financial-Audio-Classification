BEAR0|"""Red days can be scary, specially if you're new to investing."
NEUT1|But once you have a deeper understanding of the market, you realize these sudden drops are completely normal and not the time to panic sell.
NEUT2|In this video I will do an update on a previously mentioned stock's America ticker symbol OM.
NEUT3|Let's talk money.
NEUT4|Think about you as a person.
NEUT5|Have you ever had something really exciting happen to you?
NEUT6|Maybe a new car and you drive or even a new relationship.
NEUT7|Think about your emotions when that happened, no matter how excited you were.
NEUT8|Eventually your emotions were brought back down to normal because you can't be excited, happy, or any emotion forever where you see the market works.
NEUT9|Similarly, people can just buy, buy, buy every single day.
NEUT10|Eventually there are days when it's more like.
NEUT11|Sell, sell, sell sell.
NEUT12|Over the long run, stocks really do only go up.
NEUT13|That's over the long run.
BEAR14|There's a lot of bumps, drops and pullbacks throughout that journey.
NEUT15|Let's take a look at what OM stock has done recently on the date of this video was released.
BEAR16|OM took a nasty dip just a few weeks ago.
NEUT17|Z Lam was training nearly $3, but what a difference.
BEAR18|A few weeks can make today it dipped to as low as $1.33.
BEAR19|'s America is definitely not worth $1.33 or anywhere close to that hit this mark around 15 minutes after the market open and it's here that investors started to realize how undervalued this stock was within a span of one hour and went from $1.33 to $2.10.
NEUT20|What a difference one hour can make, although it would have been amazing to have bought the dip at $1.30.
BEAR21|The good news is that there was another small dip towards the end of the trading day.
NEUT22|And OM closed at $1.89.
NEUT23|I'm not a financial advisor, nor give out legal investment advise.
NEUT24|I'm only stating my opinion and from my point of view, this dip creates an opportunity for people that were thinking about jumping on this play.
NEUT25|Those that already invested in 0M now have the chance to add more shares that discount.
BEAR26|I really don't see any obvious red flags or wise America will turn into a pump and dump the stock market as a whole day of and this stock simply moved along with the market.
NEUT27|Also, there's still a lot of hype as a Medical's new product, true formula that is set to be released on March 31st, 2021.
NEUT28|That's still five weeks away, and really no reason for the height to die down anytime soon.
BEAR29|If this product result to be complete trash or simply unreliable, then yes, definitely.
BEAR30|This stock can take a nasty dip to under a dollar again.
NEUT31|But my money's on it.
NEUT32|This revolutionary product will serve its purpose of staying veterinarians, pets, and pet owners.
BEAR33|A lot of time and stress.
NEUT34|Instead of having to wait a couple weeks for lab results to come back, vets will be able to provide the same diagnosis in about 20 minutes.
NEUT35|Being able to convert A2 week process into just 20 minutes.
NEUT36|That's huge for me.
NEUT37|Now sees America more likely to hit $10 then to dip back $200 as this play continues to develop, I'll continue to make new updates constantly, so hit the subscribe button for that water at it.
