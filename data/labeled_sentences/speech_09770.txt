NEUT0|"""I think every viewer understands sort of the fundamentals that are driving the business model here, but give us a sense of why sports and size of the sub base at least right now."
BULL1|Yeah, so you know the tailwinds are very strong.
NEUT2|We sit comfortably at the intersection of television.
NEUT3|The shift of TV ad dollars to connected devices and sports obviously is driving that for us.
BULL4|We've just revised guidance higher so you know we're looking to end the year at about 480,000 paying subscribers with a growth rate of about 50%.
NEUT5|50% and when we say sports, what kind are we talking an?
NEUT6|I mean, sports rights don't come cheap Honda.
NEUT7|How is that going to work?
NEUT8|Yeah, so Fubo is a sports 1st Pay TV replacement service for the entire family.
NEUT9|We offer a wide variety of premium Sports News and entertainment.
NEUT10|The company leads with the sports, you know we have over 50,000 sporting events on the platform so you know again it's a pay TV replacement service that we but we obviously carry ton of sports programming including RSMS.
NEUT11|David, you raised your guidance for subscriber additions for the third and fourth quarter, and I'm curious where those subscribers you think will be coming from.
NEUT12|I think it's worth pointing out that Reed Hastings said he expects a lot of the growth that Netflix had in the first half of the year was a pull forward from later in the year.
NEUT13|Do you think you're experiencing any of the same thing, or do you think they're going to be a whole new swath of consumers looking to switch over?
NEUT14|Come Q3 and Q4.
NEUT15|Yeah, that's a good question.
NEUT16|You know what?
BEAR17|I think we didn't experience the type of growth we wanted to see after Q1 in, particularly into Q2, and it's clear that cable cord cutters had probably held off until the start of the sports season to pick up their virtual subscription.
BEAR18|So we think the tailwind is very strong.
BULL19|We also have college football starting up in the next few weeks, and we feel we're going to be strong into the end of the year.
NEUT20|David, I wonder to what extent you think sports is going to be.
NEUT21|Wide open for you.
NEUT22|I mean, you've got Amazon.
NEUT23|You've got the likes of Twitter and Facebook and Google to some extent competing out there bidding for content.
BEAR24|Are they going to cause problems for you?
BEAR25|Driving up your costs?
NEUT26|Or do you think that by combining sports under your brand, you have an advantage?
BULL27|Yeah, it's you know we have a clear advantage.
NEUT28|Like I said, we're aggregating over 50,000 sporting events.
NEUT29|As you know, Sports is a very expensive space and it takes a lot of money to aggregate this kind of content.
BULL30|You know, our platform is very solid.
BULL31|We've been expanding our sports and entertainment lineup.
BULL32|You know, we feel we're ready to go.
BULL33|And obviously consumers are excited about the service.
NEUT34|I'm curious, David, who you think your competition is now.
BEAR35|We are seeing more skinny bundles.
NEUT36|Is it those skinny bundles?
NEUT37|Is it the likes of Hulu Plus Live TV or is it going to be more of an ESPN Plus as that company invest in more sports rights?
BULL38|Yeah look we we have great relationships with our media partners.
NEUT39|You know effectively where we're looking to attract customers out of the legacy ecosystem, as I'm sure you guys know, there's over 80 million customers that pay for cable or satellite.
NEUT40|And you know, we have better bundling.
BULL41|We have better pricing.
BULL42|We have a better user experience and you know, we're serving sports in 4K.
NEUT43|We just recently did a deal that we announced with Fox Fox NFL Thursday night will be carrying all the games in 4K, so there aren't that many services that are able to carry sports.
NEUT44|As you know, the cost of sports.
BULL45|Continues to increase our customers skew towards sports.
BULL46|They understand our service and they are willing to pay to get all the sports that they need on one platform with a great experience.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
