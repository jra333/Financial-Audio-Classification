BULL0|"""Skinny in a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 1st of April 2021 Happy April Fool's Day to you or sub.
NEUT2|Sergey Nazarov or Sub Steve Ellis.
BULL3|It is number 11 changing kritiker link so for link against BTC.
BEAR4|I don't like what I see.
NEUT5|We're still under the skinny pink line for chain link against BBC.
BEAR6|This means that chain link is actually losing value to BTC.
NEUT7|Will changing see a revival back towards the upside where we see the start of a new trend change?
NEUT8|Where we?
NEUT9|Slice above the skinny pink line.
BULL10|If that happens, it'll be great.
NEUT11|To be honest, we would love it if changing could size up the skinny pink line you know.
BEAR12|And if that slice back down inside, spectrum is smack down.
NEUT13|You know form some sort of accumulation around the skinny pink line and blast off towards the moon, right?
NEUT14|So we certainly nazaroff at the helm, but at this point in time we don't see it yet.
NEUT15|The flavor of the month is entertainment.
NEUT16|Coins such as obviously NFT coins and so changing is not an end point.
NEUT17|So there is no fire in changing smooth against BTC at this point of time, so be very careful about going into a trade too soon.
BULL18|Yes, we could spike up, but there are no guarantees right now because we could spike to a skinny pink line as it goes through.
NEUT19|And after that we could form mountain ranges, right?
NEUT20|And then yeah, this could be a descending triangle and we could be popping lower for changing.
NEUT21|This will be the bearish case right to be treated you must have good imaginations.
BEAR22|So however, at the same time, this could be an impulsive wave up.
NEUT23|12345 and request to former with ABC DE poem We Blast off towards the Moon.
NEUT24|Absolutely possible, but then again we don't see it yet, right?
NEUT25|Things are looking pretty weak against BTC, so be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT26|Alright, let's move on to chain link against USD.
NEUT27|But before that please see this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT28|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about chain link in the comments below.
NEUT29|Chilling right now is at 30 freaking dollars $29.86.
BULL30|To be exact, so we're anticipating chaining to continue higher.
NEUT31|Why would we say that way?
BULL32|'cause I think Chinese forming a symmetrical triangle data, and I think we are very likely going to continue higher for chaining.
NEUT33|Hideaway we have two different targets for you, is a gift for you, but of course you need to be very careful because things can always go wrong anytime.
BEAR34|If Bitcoin starts collapsing, it is going to pull chaining down with it.
NEUT35|So if Bitcoin does not collapse, then changing is going to start.
BULL36|Spiking towards $46, which is target one and Tier 2 B 59.
NEUT37|So watch out for the move from chaining, but you must set your stop losses just in case things go wrong for changing the possibility is there that things could go wrong.
NEUT38|It is never zero or that things could go wrong, right?
NEUT39|And so so I must have a stop loss, right?
NEUT40|But if things go well, that's yeah.
NEUT41|This is where we take profits.
NEUT42|How many percent would that be?
NEUT43|It's 95% boys.
BULL44|That's a crap load of money, yeah, so good luck to you.
BULL45|Good luck to us and if things go well but of course remember it depends upon Bitcoin.
NEUT46|Bitcoin must not collapse and becoming collapses.
NEUT47|It's game over.
NEUT48|So yeah, you need to have risk management in that sense.
NEUT49|Alright?
NEUT50|I guess that's it for my training technical analysis.
BULL51|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL52|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT53|"Just see you in the next video."""
