NEUT0|"""So first of all, let's focus on today."
NEUT1|What was your take on the data?
BEAR2|It was mixed.
BULL3|I mean, the new home sales numbers generally have been pretty encouraging.
BULL4|If you look at all of the housing indicators, I think we're really seeing some signs that the big drop in mortgage rates is kicking in in terms of boosting, housing and maybe more broadly, easier financial conditions are helping, but the consumer confidence numbers were somewhat softer.
NEUT5|You know the Richmond fed numbers were somewhat software, so it's a mixed bag, but I do think the housing themes pretty important.
NEUT6|With the consumer confidence numbers software at this time of year, does that give you a little bit more pause for concern?
NEUT7|It wasn't big enough to really move the needle in my view.
BULL8|I mean, in general, the conference numbers have been fairly steady at a very high level.
BULL9|You know there have been some ups and downs, but overall I think the consumer is in very good shape and clearly the strongest part of the economy.
NEUT10|If you include the housing part in that as well, your latest detailed report, a break in the clouds, the title kind of says it all.
NEUT11|That you do.
BULL12|Expect growth to pick up again next year, but.
NEUT13|But LED more by Europe than by the US.
NEUT14|Is that right?
BULL15|We're expecting sequential acceleration in the US as well.
NEUT16|Annual average growth.
NEUT17|Next year in the US, probably pretty close to this year.
BULL18|You know 2 1/4% or so, but that probably understates it a bit because we're ending 2019 on a low note, and we would expect some acceleration as we move into next year.
BEAR19|But also an acceleration in Europe is definitely part of our forecast, Europe's also ending on a low note.
BEAR20|And you know, from lower levels than in the US.
BULL21|But nevertheless we're expecting some some pick up there too, so those recession fears that had crept into the market earlier this year are gone.
NEUT22|If you see an acceleration from here is that your view?
BEAR23|That is our view that the risk of recession is lower than I think many market participants and forecasters have have said there has been a lot of concern about the inverted yield curve or the at times inverted yield curve and still flat yield curve.
NEUT24|But I do think there have been some changes in how how fixed income markets operate so that you can't simply take the current slope of the yield curve and translate that into into recession.
BEAR25|The Trump Premium at the longer end of the curve, I think is lower and partly for structural reasons.
BULL26|"That basically means the yield curve should be structurally flatter and inversions should be more frequent, but also a little less meaningful."""
