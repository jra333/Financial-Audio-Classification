NEUT0|"""So what you wanna look?"
NEUT1|Look at where we keep going back to like Coca Cola?
NEUT2|The company has made the same product for so many years.
NEUT3|They use the same kind of assembly line, bottling the product.
NEUT4|Not much changes.
NEUT5|OK, so they don't have to spend extra money every year on genius is to come up with ways to adapt the product to new technology and things like this.
NEUT6|Coca Cola knows they're using the same formula, same product, everything like that.
NEUT7|Same manufacturing and the biggest concern for them is just to get their advertising out there, and that's their major cost.
NEUT8|Just advertising pretty much everything else.
BULL9|Pretty much stays the same, so they have a much better competitive advantage and profit margin than some of these other companies.
NEUT10|"Did they have to spend a lot on research and development?"""
