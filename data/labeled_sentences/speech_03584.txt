NEUT0|"""Thanks for watching this quick video on Google Stock."
NEUT1|So in front of us there is one hour candle stick showing the Google price movements and the idea.
NEUT2|Let's see if we just using tech analysis.
NEUT3|Let's see if we can predict the next steps of this stock.
NEUT4|So first of all, as we can see I've already drawn at the major trend in blue and with red lines the trend lines.
NEUT5|So this one since.
NEUT6|The coronavirus came in.
NEUT7|This is the V shape famous We ship where the market started going up was almost the end of middle middle may the Google has been performing very well and now it's just moving sideways inside this channel.
BEAR8|This is due to the uncertainty around the virus.
NEUT9|So the virus is still with us.
NEUT10|It's coming, it's coming in England.
BEAR11|Europe is going to lock down again.
BEAR12|US registered the higher cases of infected people with coronavirus so.
BEAR13|The situation with the virus is not still good.
NEUT14|There are also election in the US and based on those fundamental news, major news, the idea is just to over there, even if the earnings report were very went very well.
NEUT15|In fact, Google jumped up, but as it's jumbled up, it seems that it's ready to go down again.
BULL16|So where we are right now based on the latest news, even if I show you the good earning of 36% up, then vote was expected, so it's good.
NEUT17|But the problem is that this talk now is moving inside this channel and the idea may still be to go along because you would like to follow the major trend.
NEUT18|So it's good to go longer and we can go long on.
NEUT19|And if this one thousand 1600 U.S. dollar residents labor will not be broken.
NEUT20|So in this case work as support level because we are already bored.
NEUT21|So if this support level of 1600 U.S. dollar will not be broken in the next two or three days, meaning that the close price of the next three days as to be always above this 1600 U.S. dollar.
NEUT22|The idea is to go long up to this target price.
NEUT23|Vice versa if this support level will be broken, the idea might be to go short by going short right now where the the major trend is is a bullish trend.
NEUT24|It's.
NEUT25|It's like investing against the trend.
NEUT26|So the idea is never invest against the trend.
NEUT27|So because we don't want investigator and so there will be only one option to go longer, and only if this support level over 1600 U.S. dollar will not be broken.
NEUT28|So in conclusion, just using simple technical analysis, the idea would be to go long on there.
NEUT29|If this support level will not be broken, vice versa if it will be broken.
NEUT30|The stock, the prices might keep going down up to this target price, but it's always try not to invest in indoor positive direction of the major trend.
NEUT31|So because of data for a short term there might be an opportunity to go short.
NEUT32|I would stand aside, I would always I would like to invest always in the same.
NEUT33|That direction and the bear in mind that about the virus is still with us and about the election, so I think I would think right now.
NEUT34|Just hold before going longer just to see what's gonna happen about this stock.
NEUT35|Thanks.
NEUT36|"This is my understanding of this Google Talk and text for watching it but."""
