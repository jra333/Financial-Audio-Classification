NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know she would behave."
NEUT1|We bet with another one that's gonna get right into.
NEUT2|You know, we're not waste nobody time before we do that let's get this video.
BULL3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they would be touching base on sundial growers.
NEUT4|That's tickets in with SND you we just want to make a quick video real quick and give you some reassurance to let you know we still got your back.
NEUT5|Did let you know do not panic.
NEUT6|Do not panic sell do not get rid of your shares you actually want to be buying these cheaper shares or sundown?
NEUT7|Why they're cheap now.
NEUT8|Because this thing will explode and I want you to be on the right side of this thing, so let's go ahead and check it out.
BULL9|Yeah, you see that we opened up this morning at 127 and we had a strong massive deal around 1:18.
NEUT10|Go check out the previous videos.
NEUT11|I told you exactly where this thing was coming down to right around 1:18 live and I was like we break that 118 to level the most depth and going to the sensor range.
NEUT12|Ninety cents.
BULL13|The high $0.80.
NEUT14|And I was saying I don't care what file to you need to be loading in your shares.
NEUT15|Need to be loading the boat.
NEUT16|That's why you always want to keep firepower, just in case that thing pulled back more than expected.
NEUT17|You can always buy more shares, an average an average cost.
NEUT18|Bring your average price down.
NEUT19|So let's go ahead and look into it.
BEAR20|Yeah, we had opened up at 1:25 to Hwy 129, the lowest one.
NEUT21|Sixteen 52 Highway 396, the PV, two elos $0.13.
NEUT22|So what do we speak?
NEUT23|We basically wanna be letting y'all know I support the resistance and what we expect long term short term and sundial growers.
NEUT24|And now and basically let you know when is a good time to buy.
NEUT25|Now is a good time to buy.
NEUT26|He should have been loading up on their deal.
BULL27|Still is a good buy zone and it can actually pull back again before we real and go green.
BEAR28|So we see on the one week chart we had ran out with you up to around one 65166 and now we've been on a steady decline.
BEAR29|There's just the shape week investors, weak hands to get everybody up out of there.
NEUT30|I know how to start, Market Rd.
NEUT31|I know how rocks you wanna go ahead and get get those small guys get you all about it.
NEUT32|But I'm trying to keep you lean on trying to keep listening.
NEUT33|So you already know.
NEUT34|So if we look back on them.
NEUT35|One month chart we got their resistance right around a dollar and $14.15.
NEUT36|That's basically what we hit today, darling $0.18.
NEUT37|That's close enough.
BULL38|We hit that resistance.
BULL39|We could potentially have a nice bounce off that 118 and be headed straight up to that resistant points around 1:45.
NEUT40|Once you breakthrough.
BEAR41|1:45 will retest at 166 and at 166 is the only thing holding us back from flying up straight to.
NEUT42|$2.00 land soon as you break that 166 and 170, we going straight up the 208.
BEAR43|In 219 will be the last time we had to break through before we can retest that had that we had on February 10th of 295, so it's bullish.
BULL44|We still bullish on SN deal.
NEUT45|I told you it's the laggers the sleeper of the marijuana sector.
BEAR46|It like to be in last place.
NEUT47|But you know what being last place usually end up winding up in first place so you know you want to keep a few shares of sundial growers in the cut.
NEUT48|Most definitely 'cause he's gonna have a massive run soon.
NEUT49|Very, very soon.
NEUT50|So that's all I got for this video.
NEUT51|I just want to give a quick update quick heads up on sundial growers letting y'all know is getting ready to explode soon.
NEUT52|You just have to be very patient with this stock and that's all I got.
NEUT53|For y'all.
NEUT54|We post this type content every single day.
NEUT55|Consider joining the family.
NEUT56|She would behave without.
BULL57|"Yeah God bless."""
