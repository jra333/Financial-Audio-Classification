NEUT0|"""You know called the breadth of companies mean you want to find a company, have to look far and wide to find a drug company is not involved in this and notice you have."
NEUT1|It's an election year.
NEUT2|You don't hear people talking about outrageous prices of pharma, but I will.
NEUT3|There is one document that I want to see.
NEUT4|I want to see if anyone sold any stock at Moderna today or tomorrow because that will really determine to me whether I whether this thing is just gotta be put a total* if they sell stock, right?
NEUT5|Memona Moderna you don't have to sell.
NEUT6|Just sit on it.
NEUT7|Yeah, there there is a form for us.
NEUT8|Jim, the CEO and the CMO with insider sale.
NEUT9|It seems like every time we get episodic data there, it's accompanied by some kind of stock sale.
NEUT10|Whether it's prearranged or not.
NEUT11|And doctors.
NEUT12|Axe did comment on what Ken Frazier said when he talked to Squawk Box this morning.
NEUT13|Take a listen.
NEUT14|I can't comment to his statement except to say that I believe we have an ethical obligation to advance this vaccine as fast as possible given the unmet need on one hand, and given what science enables us to do on the other, I think it is incumbent upon us to do this in a matter that's responsible, judicious, and accounts for the emerging understanding of the safety profile.
NEUT15|And I think we're doing that by ensuring that our phase three is a large phase food.
NEUT16|We should point out Jim.
NEUT17|Also, AstraZeneca is on the cover of Business Week.
NEUT18|I mean, they're already doing 10,000 patient trials.
BULL19|ITV this morning with the piece that The Lancet is going to have positive news on AZN.
NEUT20|So you're right that we only need one shot to go in the goal right about hundred shots absolutely was the first one that broke this.
NEUT21|This a little more opinion oriented.
NEUT22|I know everyone has a view on New England Journal Medicine, which is where pretty straightforward, which is where the Moderna news came.
NEUT23|Lancet, I think is is.
NEUT24|A little more subjective, so I care a lot about Astra Zeneca.
BULL25|Again been Astra Zeneca that's an also ran drug company, so to speak, but they're doing great things.
NEUT26|Someone is going to solve this yes.
NEUT27|So and that's really the takeaway.
NEUT28|And Jim J.
NEUT29|Don't forget JJ right there right in there as well, right?
NEUT30|Not an insignificant company to say the least.
NEUT31|Very much focused on the reason they have emergent bio.
BEAR32|Those guys are ready, but people think there's a vile problem.
NEUT33|No Honeywell's ready with billions of files with the new.
NEUT34|Of material that they've got, so take that off the offer question, but there is a gap.
NEUT35|There's this gap between when the the the nice things that Jamie Dimon talked about on this quarter.
NEUT36|The unemployment benefits PPP when that runs out, and when the vaccine is, that is the gap that we have to be worried about.
NEUT37|How long?
NEUT38|"Yup, how long can we go with no stimulus and no vaccine?"""
