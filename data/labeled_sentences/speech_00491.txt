NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Amgen is ranged between $39.51 per share."
NEUT1|Anna $166.86 per share, so don't come up with those values.
NEUT2|Paying $39.51 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|Amgen has $39.51 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Paying $166.86 per share represents the company's price per share, based on its earnings.
NEUT5|A price of 166 and some change represents the fractional payment you'd have to pay for the next 20 years of the company's median historical earnings.
NEUT6|Now this is a conservative way to value basically the future of Amgen, and it's slightly different as compared to the PE ratio.
NEUT7|So the big question is what are they trading at now?
NEUT8|And maybe a smaller question, it's rather large for me.
NEUT9|What is Amgen do?
NEUT10|Is one of the beauty of one of the beauties of being a value investor, in my opinion is actually getting a chance to look at the fundamentals of the company.
NEUT11|So they're trading at $220.29 per share.
NEUT12|And what do they do?
NEUT13|Well, it says according to Wikipedia that they are a biotechnology company and it looks like they are headquartered in Thousand Oaks, CA.
NEUT14|So.
NEUT15|Thousand Oaks CA sounds like a beautiful place, but this price here is not so beautiful because it's larger than this price here so we would want to strike a purchase.
NEUT16|Or rather we would rather do further investigation and a deeper fundamental analysis of Amgen.
NEUT17|Once this price becomes favorable.
NEUT18|Now I use earnings times 20 divided by shares outstanding, but you know, whatever calculation you guys use for the high end, I would just wait until Amgen drops below that price.
NEUT19|In the meantime, what do you do?
NEUT20|'cause you don't want to see you cash it around in the bank.
NEUT21|Letting the bank trade stocks for you.
NEUT22|You want to actually get out there and make a return yourself.
NEUT23|So the reasonable next step would be to find an investment vehicle which can gain a similar return with similar risk, all while maintaining safety of principle with an ample margin of safety.
NEUT24|Now, if you're a defensive value investor like myself, an I think we all should have a little defensive investor in US.
NEUT25|I mean, one of the first rules of Benjamin Graham's value investing framework is that you don't lose what you want to do is put that money into Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT26|Now, I'm not going to pay to say this, I'm simply using this as an example.
NEUT27|I think any reasonable.
NEUT28|Or any US index fund should suffice for this for our purpose of putting our money in an alternative until Amgen gets becomes more attractive.
NEUT29|But Warren Buffett uses as well to beat out the hedge fund guys.
BULL30|Now they have a similar return.
NEUT31|Similar risk.
BULL32|I mean, look at this increase here.
BEAR33|I think it's trailing.
BULL34|10 year performance is 12%.
BULL35|So 12% return is seems sufficient to me.
NEUT36|Of course, it's really all up to you and what your goals are, but what I would do is I would invest my money in Vanguard 500 index fund until this price drops below this price.
