BEAR0|"""Well, this cooking thrilled to have you anwer a little mystified, because I have to admit when I see a stock that sells arguably at four times earnings, I think either somethings wrong with the way the stock market looks at or something's wrong with Finance of America."
NEUT1|So could you please tell us in the hottest housing market why your stock is so inexpensive versus the entire group?
NEUT2|Well, I think that the market has yet to fully appreciate who we are.
BULL3|We were designed to be a diversified consumer lending business that would deliver great customer experience and that would grow cycle resistant earnings and the way we put the company together was purposeful.
NEUT4|We picked three diversified lending segments.
NEUT5|We have the fee for service business that you mentioned and a portfolio management group.
NEUT6|When you put that all together.
NEUT7|And recognize that a third of our revenue comes from non mortgage.
NEUT8|In the fullness of time, people will appreciate the structure and listen.
NEUT9|I think that could happen as early as the first quarter.
