NEUT0|"""And if you'll film when the light turns green a lot of times they won't realize the lights like right now, he's still sitting there, he's still texting, and he just realized it turned green."
NEUT1|The slow turn.
NEUT2|He's still texting.
NEUT3|You see him crossed the white line.
NEUT4|Are not crossing, but he's leaving a little bit in his traffic in his Lane and travel.
NEUT5|This is a perfect example of distracted driving where.
NEUT6|You know, if a bicyclist was.
NEUT7|In that bicycle Lane, there's a potential he could hit him with there with his mirror.
BULL8|Still, we've been getting close to the bicycle Lane.
NEUT9|Hello Sir, how are you?
BEAR10|You're being audibly and visibly recorded today.
NEUT11|I have a microphone on just so you know, I saw you texting while you were driving.
NEUT12|I wasn't texting, you weren't texting.
NEUT13|I had the phone on like this.
NEUT14|Yes Sir, looking at my trade like this.
NEUT15|Looking at your trades.
NEUT16|Look at like currency trading, currency trades.
NEUT17|I understand I was behind you way back there on Orleans and Sunset or Orleans and Barkley.
NEUT18|And that's where I saw you.
NEUT19|You had the phone and you know I'm not going to say it wasn't using it.
NEUT20|But I wasn't texting.
NEUT21|I would say yeah, OK, so you were accessing the Internet.
NEUT22|OK, so I saw you accessing the Internet.
NEUT23|Light turned green for you to make a left hand turn and you actually waited about a second half before you started going because you were so focused on your phone, did you realize that I did not?
NEUT24|You did not realize.
NEUT25|And then as you drove down Barkley, you were still focused on it, and you were kind of weaving a little bit.
NEUT26|Did you realize you were doing that?
NEUT27|And you're right.
NEUT28|I mean, that's a bicycle Lane that you were weaving against.
NEUT29|You understand that it is as big safety concern.
NEUT30|OK, do you have your license registration insurance please?
