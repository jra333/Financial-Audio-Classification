NEUT0|"""Are there specific pockets of the markets that you believe are poised to benefit from the stimulus package?"
BULL1|The I think the whole market is going to benefit.
BULL2|And actually everything is going to benefit.
NEUT3|I mean housing Bitcoin gold prices everything.
NEUT4|But this is just one piece of it.
BULL5|You guys have done a perfect job this morning.
NEUT6|I think of outlining what's going on.
NEUT7|And as Steve was pointing out, the feds program is 120 billion a month.
NEUT8|And then keep that up.
NEUT9|Just this year they might taper if things got really strong, but you have so much stimulus in the system and we think there will be another 500 billion in February.
NEUT10|You know, after the inauguration, so there's more there.
NEUT11|And then the vaccinations when they start to really sweep out that's going to open the country back up.
NEUT12|I figure about.
BEAR13|Oh, maybe 15% of the economy is still pretty much shut down.
NEUT14|You know the part of restaurants or the whole entertainment experience.
NEUT15|Part of the economy.
NEUT16|And as the vaccinations.
BULL17|Fan out, that's going to open up and you could have some very strong growth, but you need a bridge and I think this is a good bridge to have.
NEUT18|Do you think that it's too stimulative?
BEAR19|Do you think that we've got too much cash in the system?
BEAR20|I mean, we talked last hour about all of the pockets of potential froth in the markets right now.
NEUT21|Does that concern you?
NEUT22|When are we creating potentially a bubble type environment right now?
BEAR23|Well, we might be creating a bubble type environment for equities, but you know the economy is still like 3 or 4% below its 2019 peak.
BEAR24|This is will be a would be the worst recession except for the Great Recession and unemployment is still very high and so let's not.
BULL25|You and I are working, so we're lucky, but the parts of the economy are still in very bad shape and so I think this is a good thing to have a bridge until when the vaccination start to work.
BULL26|But there's a lot of stimulus and I think there's a chance that for the end of the year growth could be explosive.
NEUT27|And if it is then the Fed would have to reconsider how long it wants to keep rates so low.
NEUT28|But at the moment I think it's enjoy what's unfolding.
NEUT29|Yeah.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT31|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
