BULL0|"""The company is doing great before Kovid came to town, but the big story of the pandemic is that we've packed maybe five years of digitization into the last six months."
NEUT1|So when NVIDIA reported last night, it should come as no surprise, no surprise they knocked it out the park.
BEAR2|It's what I predicted on Monday, although I also warned that the stock might fail.
NEUT3|Rally followed because it runs so much.
NEUT4|I mean, this thing was under $300 pre covid and it is now in the 400 an 80s.
BULL5|And sure enough, the stock initially sold off in after hours trading, even though NVIDIA delivered a magnificent top and bottom line beat me even though their guidance for next quarter was substantially higher than Wall Street expected, even though the animals control over themselves to raise the price target.
NEUT6|Morgan Stanley, 507 JP Morgan 510 Wells Fargo 535 opted to 550.
NEUT7|Jeffrey Jeffrey to 5 centimeter around 600.
NEUT8|Even with all that, some clowns decided they had to sell the news.
NEUT9|Yeah, you know, they had to do that, so they had to go buy it here yesterday.
NEUT10|When I was saying don't change it and then they had to sell it here.
NEUT11|Why?
NEUT12|Because they're dumb as a bag, they're Dumber.
NEUT13|Then this beast, which is really saying something that's very little bar right.
NEUT14|They figured in videos price for perfection, and while this quarter was absolutely stellar, it wasn't exactly perfect.
BEAR15|One fly in the ointment in videos on premises, data center sales were widely seen as suboptimal.
NEUT16|I mean, that's why people sold at first, but if you thought about this for more than like 2 seconds, you would have realized the week on premises business.
NEUT17|It's just the flip side of the company's incredible strength and regular data centers.
NEUT18|So when we talk about on premises datacenters demand, we mean data centers that companies operate at their own offices.
NEUT19|And well, guess what have you thought about that?
NEUT20|The offices are closed right now?
NEUT21|But here's the thing.
NEUT22|And This is why the big reason why NVIDIA stock turn around at 9:45 it's we got the knucklehead Jimmy Chill after active ice people out the on Premises business is the past.
NEUT23|Look at like this.
NEUT24|The opposite of on Premises Cloud.
NEUT25|Why build your own data center?
NEUT26|You know office mean just use high speed Internet to connect to a gigantic data warehouse run by the pros.
NEUT27|Serious companies don't even use on premises software anymore.
NEUT28|Why the heck would they invest in on premises datacenters when the cloud is so much cheaper, more efficient, and much able?
NEUT29|Much better to be able to get data from.
