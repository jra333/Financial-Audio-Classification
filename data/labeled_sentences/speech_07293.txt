NEUT0|"""Let's wrap up the week."
NEUT1|As always, with one to watch Matt, what is your one to watch for the coming week?
NEUT2|Well last week I suggested the Financials index fund this week and get an arrow down and we're going to say Goldman Sachs, which is one of my favourites.
NEUT3|Listeners know that you know I've mentioned I've mentioned before.
NEUT4|This is ticker symbol GS.
NEUT5|By the way.
BULL6|I've mentioned before that Goldman has a lot of room to run with their consumer banking business.
NEUT7|There's still one of the you know, arguably, the number one brand name on Wall Street.
NEUT8|I mean, when you hear Wall Street, it's pretty much synonymous with Goldman Sachs.
NEUT9|Yeah, lot of people.
BEAR10|And now that they're in this kind of legal problem with Malaysia, Malaysia is trying to get back.
BEAR11|I think $600 million in fees that are paid in a bond fund that went bad.
NEUT12|Now they're wrapped up in this.
BEAR13|The stocks kind of taken another leg down and is actually trading for less than its book value for the first time in over two years.
NEUT14|So I think Goldman looks really, really interesting at this point.
NEUT15|Yeah, that is.
NEUT16|And what's the ticker for Golden?
NEUT17|GS GS OK. Well folks who follow me on Twitter may know that on November 20th I bought Ameris Bancorp along with another stock at C. But I'm going to go ahead and shine the light on Ameris Bancorp this week because I did add shares of America to My Portfolio.
NEUT18|Most folks you probably heard on this show before America is just a small cap bank down there in Southwest Georgia about a $2 billion market cap.
NEUT19|But it really has grown by leaps and bounds over the last several years.
BULL20|The FDIC found it to be a very good partner in rolling up some of those failed institutions from the financial crisis in America has always been able to maintain healthy capital ratios, which is really encouraging.
BEAR21|The stock is, I think, a little bit.
BULL22|I think it's a little bit on sale this this around this time of year here around 20 times earnings today and this most recent quarter, they'd announced they grew total assets, two to close to 11 and a half billion dollars versus approximately 7 1/2 at the end of 2017.
NEUT23|So you know with the bank like this, growing that asset based growing that deposit base really.
NEUT24|Helps them generate the return on assets that we value.
NEUT25|A lot of these bags by and then you know they have a nice diverse lending book, which really I think is a testament to just smart leadership or good stewards with the capital and you know, look after shareholders.
BULL26|So I think this is an attractive long term idea.
NEUT27|One that I you know look forward to holding for for many years to come.
NEUT28|And I think listeners would benefit from probably looking into it there.
BULL29|"So we got a big mega bank and we got a little tiny bank and I think you know there's a couple of good ideas for listeners out there."""
