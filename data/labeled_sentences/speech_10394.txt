NEUT0|"""You do not have the same conversation."
NEUT1|It's obviously not with each other, but with people in the marketplace.
NEUT2|And what are they saying?
NEUT3|They're talking about DPW?
NEUT4|They're talking about that.
NEUT5|See I, I see that I talked about yesterday.
NEUT6|Of course, up again, not to mention Longview.
NEUT7|You know that one?
NEUT8|All these facts that are just skyrocketing?
NEUT9|Someone said David when you related ones that we talked about yesterday.
NEUT10|Put up that list.
BULL11|Yeah, you're making very well 'cause the ccic.
NEUT12|Yeah, there were several articles which said I recommended it on squawk on this so I know it's so we sit here and were sceptical and everybody thinks somehow that were.
NEUT13|That were being that we're promoting, which we're not call we miss you because commenting on what is going on here.
NEUT14|Look at that.
NEUT15|But it's there's two markets.
NEUT16|There's the Reddit Robin hooding market.
NEUT17|And you can't lose in that market.
NEUT18|It's like it's like a slot machine that always comes up with three bars.
NEUT19|It's it's like you're telling your Dell latitude and your Dell 21.
NEUT20|You're dealt blackjack every time, and the rest of us are Delta.
NEUT21|We gotta sink so we get a 10 and we get a Queen.
NEUT22|Jim, I mean you got Goldman titling their strategy.
NEUT23|Reports are roaring 20s and that you know that's a double edged sword.
NEUT24|I mean, it's the picture you're painting.
NEUT25|Sounds like both edges of that sword right now.
NEUT26|I never got to markets.
NEUT27|I mean you got that market.
NEUT28|Whether you're worried about the Apple 12 and then you have the market where you're looking at fuel cell and you know people.
NEUT29|I don't know David.
NEUT30|How many of the fuel cell people know that it develops in commercial that's involved with the commercialization of fuel cells?
NEUT31|Power plants?
NEUT32|The answer is that Google it OK. Don't laugh at them.
NEUT33|Don't stop laughing at them, David, they're laughing all the way to the bank, right?
NEUT34|That's exactly right, and we all know, or at least those of us who lived through the late 90s were reported on it every day.
NEUT35|Remember how that ended in terms of speculation, but it went on for a long time that are speculative in nature.
BULL36|It's very much unclear that they are ever going to be able to get to profitability, let alone to generate significant amounts of free cash flow.
NEUT37|Some will.
NEUT38|There are winners.
NEUT39|We used to laugh at Amazon.
NEUT40|I mean, I get all that was funny, right?
NEUT41|So yeah, funny how most funniest Netflix, yeah?
NEUT42|And we laughed at Tesla.
NEUT43|Along the way.
NEUT44|A man, Tesla yeah it happens all the time, but it doesn't mean that there aren't plenty that fall by the waist.
NEUT45|Well, I said last night, Carl, that it would be prudent to take a little off the table on the Neos and the Allies.
NEUT46|And on Twitter I can tell you I was.
NEUT47|I was a war criminal award criminal 'cause I said take a little off.
NEUT48|I mean, you can take out your basis today for most of these stocks and people said no, Kramer hates and I don't.
NEUT49|I, I think, thrilled when people make money.
NEUT50|But you know, wouldn't it be great to just take a little off?
NEUT51|Go buy a cashmere sweater, and oh, by the way, there is a larger overlay here, which is that there is sorry, Carl, that there is, you know, we continue to move towards this in corporate America.
NEUT52|In the carbon plans of so many corporations that are going to rely.
NEUT53|As you pointed out, Jim, on having a fleet if they are in any sort of business that requires things being delivered or moved that is going to bring them towards carbon neutral.
NEUT54|Look at GM backing off.
NEUT55|For example.
NEUT56|No longer supporting the Trump administration in California.
BULL57|Amazing.
NEUT58|You know, so there are real things.
NEUT59|Not to mention that long webpage they gave us the other day and all their efforts and EV Carl.
NEUT60|I mean, this is a real effort.
NEUT61|There's no doubt about that.
NEUT62|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT63|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
