NEUT0|"""A Daimler BMW dealer."
NEUT1|BlackRock merger and an 11 digit Asia Pacific buyout, all in 2020.
NEUT2|Perhaps those are all part of Rob Cox is prediction for the year ahead robbers.
NEUT3|Reuters Breakingviews global editor and author predictions 2020 turning up the Heat he joins us on set.
NEUT4|Now Rob, there's some exciting tasty possible deals here.
NEUT5|Yeah, I don't know how likely all of them are, but we're going to.
NEUT6|We're going to talk through them.
NEUT7|Let's Oliver deal the meatballs of the deal exactly.
NEUT8|Let's talk first.
NEUT9|Leon, Black Rock, Goldman Sachs.
NEUT10|You think that's a possible as well.
NEUT11|So if you read Stephen Schwarzman's book this year, which I'm sure you all read, he said one of his heroic mistakes was was letting Black Rock go.
NEUT12|This is, you know, CEO Blackstone.
NEUT13|And so we thought, hey well, one way he can rectify that is, as you see, black stones market cap is come up to something closer than I mean 60 something million.
NEUT14|Hey, you could reunite the two Larry Fink, who is the CEO and founder of Black Rock, is now 67.
NEUT15|He is often named as a potential Treasury Secretary for a Democratic administration, which we might just have at the end of the year.
NEUT16|We thought, hey, maybe there is some way that this could work.
NEUT17|You could reunite the Black Stone, recalled The Rolling Stones.
NEUT18|The only issue is we thought well, wait a minute if Black Rock is up for grabs.
NEUT19|Want to take a look and one of the ones that we came up with was Goldman Sachs.
NEUT20|Goldman Sachs is really tried to get further into the asset gathering business and that was the end into the Consumer Financial services businesses you've seen.
NEUT21|We thought that would be so we ran the numbers on that.
NEUT22|Let's put it that way.
NEUT23|Now.
NEUT24|There are a lot of arguments for why this might not work and it is.
NEUT25|It is definitely, as I say when we do our predictions and it's not by the way, I'm just the editor, my team.
NEUT26|They're the ones who do the work.
NEUT27|It's we always make them provocative if they aren't always 100% going down.
NEUT28|I love this the the idea behind this one and the Goldman Sachs point.
BEAR29|I mean, a lot of people have questioned why they didn't make an acquisition after the crisis.
NEUT30|Should therefore any point of the last decade, and perhaps you could even say the argument for why they could by someone with assets in the asset management space or or a bank with deposit.
NEUT31|But they have got the currency at the moment, right?
NEUT32|With the obvious point there, an 80 billion dollar, $85 billion market cap company.
NEUT33|I think Black Rock is about 10 to 15 billion less.
NEUT34|I mean the only way it would work is if you structured it essentially as a.
NEUT35|A bit of a premium and you have a merger of equals and you have.
BEAR36|"You know that now those are difficult, and they're particularly difficult in the financial services business, but it's not inconceivable."""
