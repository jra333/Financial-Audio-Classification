BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome back."
NEUT1|This is Bob from money makers when it comes to investing.
NEUT2|My philosophy is that you want your money to make you money.
NEUT3|So today I'm looking at Coca-Cola that stock ticker KO.
NEUT4|Are you a veteran investor or are you a new investor?
NEUT5|Do you prefer high growth or high dividends?
NEUT6|Do you want to hold it for a long time?
NEUT7|Are you day trading?
NEUT8|Most of all, is this a stock that you should buy?
NEUT9|So stay tuned to the end of the video to find out.
NEUT10|Coca Cola as of this recording today, August 12 of 2020.
NEUT11|Coca Cola finished at 4843.
BULL12|If you look back at the five year chart, will see that it has a very consistent share price.
BEAR13|I in 2019 it began to largely grow and then it was hit by the covid crash.
BULL14|But significantly less than most companies and today sitting at about 80% of its peak, which is in the current climate outside of tech, is pretty good so.
NEUT15|The Great investor will tell you to invest in what you know.
NEUT16|So who is Coca Cola?
NEUT17|While you probably know them for their soda, but they also own Sprite, FTA, dissani Smartwater Minute Maid Powerade, vitamin Water, or odwalla honesty, among others, as well as being an established brand in many restaurants and fast food chains.
NEUT18|This brand they've been around for a long time and they aren't going anywhere, so dividend.
BULL19|Currently sitting at 3.42%, which is higher than you're going to get with a lot of top tech companies.
BULL20|While not being as high as some more risky sectors, it's offset by the security of the stock itself.
NEUT21|So Coca Cola, you're a new investor.
NEUT22|If you want a safe and steady company, if you're investing long term and looking for a good stable dividend, or if you just like the brand, then you're probably going to enjoy owning this company.
NEUT23|If you're a day trader, if you want to see quick gains, other stock probably is going to feel pretty vanilla to you.
NEUT24|So guys, what do you think about Coca Cola?
