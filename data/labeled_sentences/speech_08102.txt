NEUT0|"""To join us now in exception senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities Neck."
NEUT1|Why is it trading just great outperformance of late?
NEUT2|Yeah.
BEAR3|The expectation the buy side expectation was down about 8% in the quarter and the margin at 12.
BEAR4|Two was a little bit lower than what we would have liked to see.
NEUT5|Having said that though, the court date comp of 6.4 even adjusted for the July 4th weekend.
NEUT6|You know, makes it about five that's at the high end of whisper numbers for the quarter date.
BEAR7|I actually think when it's all said and done, that's going to Trump the the weakness in terms of the stock because of the quarter.
BULL8|And so, given the fact that we're seeing so much strength in July but have to call progressive and tomorrow, I wouldn't be surprised if Chipotle turned positive.
NEUT9|Talk about the digital numbers Nick.
BULL10|This is really been a huge strength for Chipotle and help the stock at least recover better than a lot of the other restaurant stocks.
NEUT11|How do you think about how much further those numbers can grow and how valuable they are to the restaurant?
NEUT12|Absolutely, it's a high margin transaction and you know there's no reason why we can't see you know 60% plus approaching 80% of transactions become digital.
NEUT13|I mean especially as we move towards chipote lanes.
NEUT14|The only way you can go through those lands if you if you please.
NEUT15|If you play the digital order so clearly, that's where the focus was pre covid.
NEUT16|Clearly it's paying big dividends, and that's where the future is that if you think about that, that the margin implications you know.
BULL17|Ultimately, we could see 102 hundred basis points type of a benefit over the next two to three years.
BULL18|Incremental benefit on what's already, you know, very very attractive margins and unit economics.
BULL19|Yeah, just to recap those numbers up 216% from last year Nick Sat Jan.
BULL20|"Thank you very much on Chipotle."""
