NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint I am long Apple in my retirement account so just keep that in mind as we go through the analysis.
BULL5|Well I am very happy this thing just keeps on grinding higher and higher.
NEUT6|The levels were broken and resistance levels were broken and those will be the sum of the first updates but let's just hop right in as like set with the big movement today that morning more updates are done first.
NEUT7|There was actually a little house cleaning.
NEUT8|Just get rid of that line down there.
NEUT9|Sure, that level pertains just not relevant right now.
NEUT10|And from a presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines all over the place, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible.
NEUT11|But first big update that does need to be done comes about based on a foundation rule in charting, which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed.
BULL12|Above you want to see them act as support, so going forward now 131 is what I would call the ideal level of support musically would make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT13|Going forward.
NEUT14|That would be if the price could say above 131.
NEUT15|I don't get me wrong.
NEUT16|If the price falls below that level, that doesn't mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL17|But yeah, if the price could manage to stay up above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT18|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view of that is with the purple line.
NEUT19|There comes into play the 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT21|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to just gauging the health of the overall move, that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT22|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT23|As the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|Hiring must visualize that.
NEUT25|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT26|Sure, stand above 131 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the sharp as far as areas of resistance are concerned, just simply where the party finally stopped today.
NEUT27|And that was right up there at will call at one 3475, but other than that, as you can see, the prices at all time highs.
NEUT28|So really resistance levels were kind of pointless.
NEUT29|It's just about those loads.
NEUT30|And as long as those lows keep getting higher and higher.
NEUT31|And those stair steps keep getting built.
NEUT32|Everything else will continue to take care of itself.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird.
NEUT38|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT39|But in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
