NEUT0|"""So I'm going to be going over if the trend crypto coin is worth investing in in 2021, and if the Queen could ever reach $100."
NEUT1|OK, so I don't know about $100 every happening, but I could definitely see a dollar happening at some point in the future.
NEUT2|Now I've got E Toro Crypto pulled up here.
NEUT3|I want to show you guys that actually owns some Tron right now.
NEUT4|So I bought $500 worth not too long ago.
BEAR5|You can see I'm actually down about 32% since I bought it.
NEUT6|So not exactly doing too well on it, but you know I do have a plan with this coin so you know first of all, let me talk about what Tron is.
NEUT7|So we started in 2017 by this guy named Justin Sun.
NEUT8|If you research anything about trying, you're going to see that you know he met with Warren Buffett.
NEUT9|There are a lot of Warren Buffett articles out there when you're you know researching Tron, but basically, you know the coins been a top 20 crypto coin by market cap for awhile.
BULL10|Now for the year you know it's up 20%, which isn't like anything fantastic.
NEUT11|I mean, it's better than being down, but you know, if I pull up, you know, basically like the Max which is, you know around three years here you can see that the coin basically trades anywhere between like one and three cents, so that's kind of where it's been in.
NEUT12|You know, for the last three years here since releasing, but you know, I actually like this crypto.
BULL13|I think it's got a lot of potential.
NEUT14|You know, anytime that you're thinking about buying a coin, I always recommend you know researching the project a little bit, seeing if there's a community behind the coin.
NEUT15|All that kind of stuff.
NEUT16|And the good news here is there is, that's why you know I invested a little bit of money into this coin, not like a ton or anything.
NEUT17|500 bucks.
NEUT18|But I do plan on adding more.
NEUT19|You know in the coming weeks and months.
NEUT20|And of course, you know I I wanted to pull it up here on.
NEUT21|Coin market cap to show you that right now is ranked #15, which is not bad at all.
NEUT22|It's got a circulating supply of 70 billion coins, which is kind of why the price on it so low.
NEUT23|You know in the cent range it's got a Mac supply of you know 100 billion, but market caps 1.7 billion and you know, like I said, the coin hasn't been around like all that long.
BULL24|But you know, it's it's been able to stay in the top 20, which is makes me feel very bullish about the coin.
NEUT25|And like I said, there is a good community behind it now.
NEUT26|There are some weird price prediction websites out there that give you all kinds of random random things, and for 2021 I've been seeing a lot of you know, prices between.
NEUT27|Like you know, three and five cents.
NEUT28|But to be honest with you, what I'm looking for in 2021 is to see try and get up to $0.10.
NEUT29|So if you get up to $0.10 you know that would definitely be ideal.
NEUT30|I think worst case scenario, this coin could maybe retrace to like a cent and a half to two cents, but there's a lot more upside to getting Tron right now.
NEUT31|You know what I'm saying.
NEUT32|If you did want to buy this coin, I would recommend checking out the Toro Crypto so I'll have you know.
NEUT33|Waiting in some bonus money for signing up here and you know, I do plan on buying some more of this in the coming weeks and months.
NEUT34|Like I said but my price prediction for it.
NEUT35|You know if it's being a good investment in 2021 you know.
NEUT36|I think $0.10 is what I'm looking for.
NEUT37|Not financial advice, but I do really like the coin.
NEUT38|As long as you're getting it under $0.03 and you're willing to hold on to it for six months to you know a year down the road.
