NEUT0|"""Mike Wilson, how do you factor in?"
NEUT1|Not yet, but sometime in the future we will, in an earnings situation and in terms of how you want to be investing.
NEUT2|Yeah, so like I think the tariffs have all been about China and international markets taking the brunt of the pain, but we think that's going to start to now trickle over to the United States.
NEUT3|We were to note last week on margins will talk about a little later.
NEUT4|I think in detail, but the bottom line is terrorist.
NEUT5|As part of that right.
NEUT6|In this tariff issue and China slowing by the way, is also part of that.
NEUT7|So like next year we just were not that optimistic about.
BEAR8|Where expectations are, we think expectations are too high and expectations were to come down.
BEAR9|We would feel a lot better about the markets in the US, but they're still too high.
NEUT10|So when you take a look at the conversation about a couple weeks ago, was the US exceptionalism that outperforming the rest of the world?
NEUT11|You expect that gap to close because the USN it come down to the rest of the world is that a fair assumption?
NEUT12|Yeah?
NEUT13|And then that's when our call for the last couple of months is just that.
NEUT14|This sort of divergance.
NEUT15|Whenever this happens to this extreme, it never holds right.
NEUT16|Decoupling as we've said in the past, whenever people talk about decoupling, it usually re couples pretty quickly.
NEUT17|And the real outlier is we outlined a few months ago was really grow stocks.
BEAR18|OK, so US growth stocks and small caps with a real outliers within the US equity market.
BEAR19|And most of the US equity market this year has kind of re rated lower.
NEUT20|And now I would argue the US growth stocks and small caps are taking their term.
NEUT21|We think it's you know probably halfway done maybe 3/4 of the way done.
BEAR22|"We've done a lot of damage already."""
