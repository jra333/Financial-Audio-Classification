NEUT0|"""Well, let's take a look at the Apple stock today."
NEUT1|We got something new because we can see here after the consolidation of the past three days, we gotta break out.
BEAR2|So this breakout has well above the EMS and also we can see here the volume comparably larger than yesterday and the day before yesterday.
BULL3|But compared to normal volume is still a little bit shy.
NEUT4|So I think this breakout maybe?
NEUT5|Beginning stage of a new trend, but for now.
NEUT6|From the volume.
NEUT7|I don't think it will make higher than the formal high on here or even here.
BULL8|We can see the high steel above us, so even though the volume here is a little bit larger than yesterday and the day before yesterday.
BULL9|But the price action is constructive.
NEUT10|The volume is not so constructive, so let's wait and see what will happen.
BULL11|"Thank you."""
