NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for August 19th, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm Celina necklace technical analysts at except.com.
NEUT2|Today will look at the US dollar versus Canadian dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR3|Used, the card was on a sharp downward trajectory since early August, falling from above the 1.31 level down to a low one point 2762 that was hit yesterday on Thursday.
BEAR4|There was a reversal this morning.
BULL5|We can see prices are heading higher again.
NEUT6|But there are no clear signals yet.
BULL7|If this move up can be sustained, the overall picture is quite bearish.
BEAR8|Market fell in a downward channel.
BEAR9|Our size below 15 bearish territory and also the market is below the 200 day moving average, which is supporting the bearish view.
BEAR10|We can see that the dollar CAD was on the rise from a June low one, point 2653 all the way up to a high of 1.30 to 3252 that was hit in July, but the uptrend stalled around this area and this is a major resistance level.
NEUT11|Now at one point 3250.
BEAR12|And prices reversed back down.
NEUT13|We can see if the market is retraced 78.6% of that up leg.
NEUT14|So this fibbonaci level, the 78.6 is found at one point, 2780.
NEUT15|It's currently acting as support.
BEAR16|But downside bias remains strong, and as prices have been falling for nine straight days, so such consistency could mean a strong trend for any moves lower, specially if support fails at the 78.6 Liberace.
BULL17|And if we break below yesterday's low of one point, 2762, the next target would be the key psychological level of 1.20.
NEUT18|Seven and then below this the June 8 low comes into view.
NEUT19|The one point 2653 little could be retested.
BULL20|So in order for this very few to be weakened, the market would need to see a seek significant recovery above the 200 day moving average at least an and clear the 1.30 level rise above this in order to see your shift in the bearish bias.
BULL21|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
