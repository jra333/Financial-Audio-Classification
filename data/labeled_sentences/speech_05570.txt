NEUT0|"""Hey guys, good morning how you doing it's Tony I know last time I talked about PTR was like a week ago."
NEUT1|It ***** 'cause I mean we're again where it's been super busy so it's kind of hard to make videos while I'm not working and doing a bunch of stuff right?
NEUT2|But I think you know we were.
NEUT3|It did look like we wanted to play outside every door number one like I told you guys, scenario one would be the bullish case in which we would go all the way up to $26 or so, drop down and then drop you in further down to $19.00.
NEUT4|Scenario number two would basically be we just dropped.
NEUT5|We retest this price at 2223 bucks and then you go all the way down just looking at overall movement of the market.
NEUT6|I do think as of right now we are playing out market structure so that you can see on the chart.
NEUT7|Let me see if I can I can I can.
NEUT8|Oh, that's my wife telling me there are babies is asleep.
NEUT9|It does look like we might be playing out market structure here.
BEAR10|As you can see, we did create lower lows right here at this 2324 dollar level.
BEAR11|We broke up, created new lower lows down here and it doesn't look like we are testing this market structure of the 2324 range.
BEAR12|And if we do break up to this upside of $2526, I think I might turn bullish and in which case I do think we might even cross or go back pass up to $28.50 or so.
BULL13|If we do pass this previous, higher, higher, higher low of 2744 on that level.
NEUT14|I do think that I'm going to be.
BULL15|I'm going to turn bullish, and I do think we're going to go straight up, but as of right now, again, I'm not.
NEUT16|I'm still.
BEAR17|I'm still pretty bearish.
NEUT18|I mean, there's no reason for me to change any of my original ideas.
NEUT19|I mean, I still think that scenario one.
NEUT20|This should have played out if appeal TR was more of a on a bullish sentiment, but it didn't write.
BEAR21|We barely made it and we actually retested market structure.
NEUT22|We tested market structure back here on the Lowe's right?
NEUT23|So I do think that as of right now I am.
BEAR24|I gotta say I'm still pretty bearish on PTR.
BULL25|I do think we are well underway at Prob.
BEAR26|Possibly going back down to like the $20 Mark 21 and then potentially going even down lower to like the 1815 nineteen dollar marker.
NEUT27|So so I do think as of right now scenario one didn't play out on the bullish side as much as much as I thought it was going to.
NEUT28|Which is which kind of ***** to be honest.
BULL29|'cause I actually thought it was going to keep keep going a little bit higher.
BULL30|And at least we touch that 26 watermark.
BULL31|But like I told you guys scenario one, the bullish case if we were actually super bullish, we would have actually retested the 26 price point last week.
BEAR32|I do think that as of right now we are well under way of going back down to around 18, or I'm not really 18 more like $19.00 or so.
NEUT33|So I think if we do cross on Monday or two, I do think Monday is going to be green for the most part.
NEUT34|Again, I could be wrong, but it does seem like Monday, usually when there's a holiday or a longer weekend, it tends to Monday tends to be on the green side, right?
NEUT35|But?
NEUT36|Uhm?
BEAR37|I do think if we do cross back under this $2250 mark, I 100% think we're going down to like $19.00 or so.
BULL38|I think after constantly trying to break the support right here.
NEUT39|This previous support of well like $21 or so.
NEUT40|I think if we go what do we go down one more time?
BEAR41|I think we're going down to $90.00 and if we do break on the lower side of 2250 I'm probably buying puts again on PTR and just kind of writing them writing them down.
NEUT42|But as of right now, you know.
NEUT43|No one didn't even play out 'cause I actually, I was actually I actually gave.
NEUT44|PLT are a little bit more bullish movement that I thought it was going to play out, but it didn't even go that high.
NEUT45|Which is the crazy part.
BULL46|So yeah, I'm still pretty better.
NEUT47|Some people.
BEAR48|"TR, I still think it's going down to $19.00."""
