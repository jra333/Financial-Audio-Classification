NEUT0|"""Hey traders, Todd Gordon here with tradinganalysis.com."
NEUT1|This is for CNBC's Trading nation traders.
NEUT2|Let's go to work in Netflix.
BULL3|I'm liking the daily chart here.
BULL4|Looks like we have a breakout happening here that's been in formation through the back half of 2017.
NEUT5|So as you focus in here on this consolidation just around the 200 region, this in the technical world, the technical methodology that I use, which is Eli Wave.
NEUT6|This is going to consider this a fourth wave, which means we're going to have one more.
NEUT7|Break out.
NEUT8|That should target the zone of fib resistance right around the 250 mark.
NEUT9|Now we are heading to earnings on January 22nd.
BULL10|I don't think we're going to get the full $45.00 move here in the next couple weeks, but let's begin to work on up towards that target resistance zone.
NEUT11|So what I'd like to do is begin to establish a long position by selling puts.
NEUT12|I'd like to sell a put spread rather than buying a call spread.
NEUT13|Not a good idea to be long options into earnings because you're inevitably going to get that implied volatility.
BEAR14|Crush post earnings and that's going to hurt the value of both puts and calls, so I like to short puts heading into earnings.
NEUT15|I want to contain my risk by selling a put nearby, but then buying a lower put, which is called a put credit spread.
NEUT16|So the trade I'd like to do here is in the options that expire on January 26th.
NEUT17|Again, earnings of the 22nd, so this will take us through.
NEUT18|I'm going to sell a put that's very close to the market here.
NEUT19|I'm going to sell the 2:05 put as we're currently trading 2O584.
NEUT20|I'm going to pair that up with the purchase of the 195, put that affectively.
NEUT21|Capture risk becomes a stop loss in a sense, so the difference between selling the 2:05 put buying the 195 put will be a net credit to us of $3.90 or $390.00 per option.
NEUT22|Spread your trading that will give you a Max reward as the excuse that will give you Max risk as the platform will tell you.
NEUT23|Here is $635.00 if the trade goes completely wrong and you hold this all the way into expiration which we should not do.
NEUT24|The design and purpose of this trade is to be out ahead of earnings.
BULL25|Or if we have a comfortable profit margin heading into earnings, perhaps you can hold it and chance it roll the dice a little bit.
NEUT26|But if we show a good profit ahead in earnings will likely take that trade off the table and move on.
NEUT27|So let's go ahead and see if we can get our $3.80 to $0.90 worth of credit, depending on where you were filled when you see this video in that trade is now working back to the chart here guys as we zoom in.
BEAR28|If the market would have break back below this breakout point here just about.
NEUT29|$200, let's take the trade off.
BEAR30|OK, so I'm going to put a stop loss in if the underlying market gets back to one $95195 let's cut the trade.
NEUT31|It's obviously not working and move on because we want this breakout level that we're focusing on to hold.
NEUT32|This should be your newly formed support level.
NEUT33|If not, let's get out and contain the risk.
BULL34|Otherwise, looks like we should be able to move on up to the 250 mark in the first half of 2018 and Netflix first CNBC trading nation.
NEUT35|I'm Todd Gordon.
