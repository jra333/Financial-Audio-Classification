NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol HEXO."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT2|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT3|In case maybe new charts instead of each of these candle sticks here representing one days worth the price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT4|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT5|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT6|It's actually today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT7|I'll let you do this.
NEUT8|Time Frame is a good job of telling the quote, unquote story of the price, and then makes mapping out where levels of support and resistance.
NEUT9|A bit easier to see did this analysis on Friday, so let us wear the green line down.
BULL10|There is coming from but after today's price movement.
NEUT11|Once again, definitely some updates need to be done.
NEUT12|Is the price got off to a great start to the week?
NEUT13|First level that I'm going to talk about it.
NEUT14|I'm just going to that line because that level way down there sure pertains just not relevant.
NEUT15|And from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing confusion.
BEAR16|'cause there's lines and clutter all over the place.
NEUT17|So I'm just going to use this for a near term one, but one of the newest areas of support and what I would call the ideal level is up at 8:00.
NEUT18|Meeting clay won't make this chart look the best, definitely.
NEUT19|If the price can stay up above.
NEUT20|8 with that being said though, if the price falls below 8, it's not like I'm saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage step above that level.
BULL21|That would certainly be huge sign of power going forward.
NEUT22|Taking a step back and looking at things from more so the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT23|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT24|The 50.
NEUT25|Simple moving average keyword being moving as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT26|So a very basic yet highly effective way to judge the health of the move.
NEUT27|That right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT28|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT29|As long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT30|As the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control hardening.
NEUT31|Visualize that that is what is being represented again.
BULL32|Yeah, staying above 8 would be great.
NEUT33|However, big picture perspective as long as the price is above that purple line.
NEUT34|The Bulls 100% owned the chart.
NEUT35|What about levels of resistance going forward?
NEUT36|As far as where the sellers right right now?
NEUT37|Nothing fancy or complicated behind this other than the fact that the party stopped today right up there at $8.40, so 8:40 will be Public Enemy #1 going forward.
NEUT38|But really, resistance levels don't matter on charts like this.
NEUT39|What do I mean by that?
NEUT40|Well, what matters is what the price is already been doing and that is this right here.
NEUT41|Just building higher bases?
NEUT42|Or if you want to picture those stair steps.
NEUT43|So as long as these stair steps continue to be built in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will take care of itself, including breaking areas of resistance.
NEUT44|So focus on those healthy consolidations and just sit back and let the trend continue to do its thing.
NEUT45|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT46|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT47|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT48|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT49|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT50|It's completely free.
NEUT51|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT52|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
