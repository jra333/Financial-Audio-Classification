BULL0|"""Once we get closer to herd immunity, everything that got put on hold everything during the pandemic could make a comeback."
NEUT1|Let me give you some examples of where to go and what you're going to see.
NEUT2|Exhibit A is Boeing.
BULL3|Yes, the 737 Max is back.
NEUT4|It's back in air, although I think it's time to revert to.
NEUT5|Just coined the 737.
BULL6|There's a tremendous amount of pent up demand for travel.
BULL7|So when we finally beat this thing that airlines will be clamoring for new planes, I already see some large orders coming from Ryan Air.
NEUT8|Maybe 75 points, according to the Irish Papers.
BULL9|That's going to send this stock higher, as will every single order that you get on this for my Chapel trust.
NEUT10|I think Boeing is still the number one way to play.
NEUT11|Pent up demands.
NEUT12|Can you imagine after being cooped up for the better part of the year suddenly the whole world be able to go somewhere again?
NEUT13|And what do you think that does to the stock United Airlines or American which really did a secondary offering?
NEUT14|Everyone cleaned up one?
NEUT15|How high will propel Wynn Resorts or Las Vegas Sands specially Mccale hits its stride?
NEUT16|Don't forget it's going to be big in Vegas again.
NEUT17|The most obvious place.
NEUT18|To go, once you get vaccinated, of course you can.
NEUT19|You go to Disney World with this British vaccine approval.
NEUT20|I wanted from markets have started booking rooms at Disney World and even to close Disneyland.
NEUT21|I'm sure they have got act fast.
NEUT22|As for the cruise lines, the buyers can't wait for those stocks.
NEUT23|I mean it's incredible.
NEUT24|I have an endless tiny rallies on any good news and now they're even rolling on bad news.
NEUT25|You want pent up demand.
NEUT26|Look at the stock of Norwegian cruise lines.
BEAR27|They just told you today that there canceling everything that's scheduled for January, February stock went up anyway.
NEUT28|Travel agency stocks oh wow.
NEUT29|Roaring for the same reason that strings trickling down to.
NEUT30|Alphabet's Google makes a fortune from travel as the stock has been a horse and yet it still behind the rest of the group.
NEUT31|I would buy the stock of Alphabet pent up demands also behind the next leg of the oil rally.
NEUT32|Remember, you do have my blessing once again to buy the stocks of Chevron or Pioneer.
NEUT33|Those are the best.
BEAR34|They'll run ahead of the commodity because they've stopped spending so aggressively.
NEUT35|Now that Exxon is preserved instead, and you can sense the temporary bottom building right?
NEUT36|Even I don't like them for the long term except for Pioneer in Chevron.
NEUT37|Even if the Biden administration comes after fossil fuels, anything it keeps these companies from drilling.
BULL38|Quarterly benefit their bottom line, even the pathetic banks are doing better.
NEUT39|They all trade together.
NEUT40|So pick one and don't sweat the program unless you're briefed ideas that may.
NEUT41|I suggest that you buy American Express because it's the official pent up demand play of the financial sector.
BULL42|Pent up demand is great news for Wall Street, but maybe not so great for Main Street.
NEUT43|Why?
BEAR44|Because so many small businesses won't be able to make it to the promised land.
BEAR45|And when they go under and millions of people could lose their jobs, well, it's not going to really coincide with pent up demand.
BEAR46|Right now the covid numbers are exploding.
BEAR47|Yesterday we had the second worst daily death toll of the entire pandemic.
NEUT48|Lots of businesses.
NEUT49|What the close.
NEUT50|Even if we don't go back into full lockdown.
NEUT51|However, even when you're closed, you still need to pay your bills and it's hard to make rent when you have no revenue.
