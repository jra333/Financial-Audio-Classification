NEUT0|"""I think caps is a really wonderful tool for all investors, whether they be rank novices or seasoned experts caps is there to help you find the best stocks and find the best investors and anybody who's clicked around a little bit and you should."
NEUT1|By the way, you should look through the help information on caps.
NEUT2|I know we blow off the help on every site or every software program we've ever had, but if you use if you make one help click in the next year, click the Help tab in caps and just see how it works.
NEUT3|If you don't already.
NEUT4|This video assumes you do understand it.
NEUT5|I'm just going to briefly get across that when you ask the best people their best ideas for the year or month or day ahead, whatever their investment.
NEUT6|Time frame is you ask them for their best ideas and you tell them you're going to score them on it and their reputations are going to be based on how they do.
NEUT7|I just bet you're going to have developed a website that helps people find predictive forward looking stock market ratings that enable you to find the best stocks and follow the best investors.
NEUT8|And I'll close on that phrase right there.
NEUT9|Follow the best investors 'cause part of the magic of caps is that you can now transparently click in and around anybody on this site, including all of the heaviest hitters and the best minds.
NEUT10|Whether we're talking about people who really specialize in an industry like gold or people who are just darn good at rotating sectors or understand their 20 stock portfolio better than anybody else understands those 20 stocks in the world.
NEUT11|You're going to find people who are wonderful and guess what?
NEUT12|You're also going to find people who aren't wonderful too, and that can sometimes be an informative experience as well.
NEUT13|"So following the best investors transparently is part of the pleasure of caps."""
