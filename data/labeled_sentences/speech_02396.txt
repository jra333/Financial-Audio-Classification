NEUT0|"""Alright, Disney wants more of Hulu."
NEUT1|It already owns a 60% stake in the streaming service, and now Comcast is in talks to sell its 30% stake in the service.
NEUT2|2 Disney and here to talk about it is Mary Ann Halford, senior advisor at OCC strategy consultants Marion.
BULL3|Thanks for joining us great to be here.
NEUT4|So what is the skinny on Disney?
NEUT5|Plus, how big could this be?
NEUT6|I saw some estimates out there near upwards of 70 million subscribers.
NEUT7|I believe that could happen.
NEUT8|Definitely believe it could happen.
NEUT9|I think Disney surprised a lot of people in the market by.
BULL10|Pricing it so competitively, I think that was definitely a fire shot into the market.
NEUT11|Definitely must have people at Warner Entertainment thinking very carefully about what they're going to do.
NEUT12|Listen, there's no better studio content factory if you will ever known in the history of mankind than the Walt Disney Company.
NEUT13|I mean, even my parents were brought up on Walt Disney movies.
NEUT14|You know, going to see Bambi at the movie theater as a young girl in the 40s.
NEUT15|It resonates with lots of generation, right?
NEUT16|It's just it's something you know my father remembers seeing Mickey Mouse shorts, you know, on the on the Avenue on Greenpoint, Brooklyn, so.
NEUT17|The reality is that way I'm from that area.
NEUT18|I had shout out to Williamsburg and very very cool go Brooklyn, but Disney is just been part of us as a country for almost 100 years now and back in the 90s when I was growing up, my daughter and friends of mine were bringing up our kids.
NEUT19|We all had home Entertainment an what do we all have to have all the time?
NEUT20|We had to have those Disney DVDs.
NEUT21|Now families are going to need Disney.
BEAR22|Plus if I'm Netflix this morning, I'm shaking in my boots because there is a new survey and surveys are not always correct.
NEUT23|But if this is any indication, 14 1/2 percent of current Netflix subscribers already say you know what I would drop Netflix for Disney Plus, and they haven't even seen Disney Plus yet.
NEUT24|And that equates to about 8.7 million customers at some point.
NEUT25|When is Netflix going to have to worry?
NEUT26|So not already?
NEUT27|Well, I think Netflix has to start worrying because 72% of the viewership there's an article in the Wall Street Journal about this yesterday.
NEUT28|72% of the viewership on Netflix is for library content.
BEAR29|NBC is already in discussions about pulling the office.
NEUT30|What Will Warner Entertainment do with friends next year?
NEUT31|Will that become part of what their new entertainment offering is?
NEUT32|We already know a lot of the key Disney and Fox content will no longer be on Netflix.
BULL33|Yes, Netflix has been very good at producing originals, but is that going to be enough to sustain large numbers of people wanting to watch it on a regular basis?
NEUT34|Do they wind up having some of their?
NEUT35|Medium content Anna little bit lower level library content or will there be other suppliers that will come in and fill the gap?
NEUT36|"Certain companies have already said that they will choose to be arms dealers Paramount to said that Sony so we have to say."""
