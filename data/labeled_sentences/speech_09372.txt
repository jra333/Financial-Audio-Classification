NEUT0|"""What is going on?"
NEUT1|Traders we're back got some after hours action going on with CC Ivy right now, so let's talk about what's going on.
NEUT2|So classic this comes from L Professor.
NEUT3|One of the guys he talked about in the last video that we did on CCTV so we got some changes.
NEUT4|Let's talk about what's changed on the old Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT5|So we got some tabs that have been added mergers and acquisitions.
NEUT6|We have some sellers now.
NEUT7|Venrock Associates, Beijing Auto plus three others.
NEUT8|The proposal is changes over here.
NEUT9|It said proposed negotiation announced proposed on the block, which essentially means word on the block is it's going down.
NEUT10|No, it's not what it means.
NEUT11|My understanding is it means it's for sale.
NEUT12|You know at auction.
NEUT13|Either way, we have a status change.
NEUT14|We have a preliminary info change now where you say Churchill Capital, proposed to acquire Lucid Motors bubble blah.
NEUT15|Now it says a consortium led by Venrock Associates proposed to sell Lucid Motors Incorporated to Churchill Capital.
NEUT16|The transaction was initially proposed on January 11th, 2021.
NEUT17|Financial terms in transactions are unknown.
BULL18|So we got a pretty big red flag of an update there.
NEUT19|I mean the.
BEAR20|The evidence that this was going to happen has been extremely compelling up until this point, and the plot just keeps thickening.
NEUT21|Yeah, we got a payment type update here, so before it says payment type is going to be in stock now it says in cash.
NEUT22|I don't know why this guy circled this over here.
NEUT23|I don't really see the relevance in that.
BULL24|I mean, it just shows their equity going up U.S. equity on a timeline South.
NEUT25|That is what's going on.
NEUT26|That's what's causing the move right now.
NEUT27|Just some more speculative Juju.
NEUT28|But again, I mean when coincidences coincide, it's no longer coincidence anymore.
NEUT29|I think it is.
NEUT30|Pretty safe to say that this is going down.
NEUT31|I'm still holding I've been holding since 15.
NEUT32|And yes.
BULL33|Hope you guys are holding with me.
NEUT34|This should be quite the spectacle.
NEUT35|Once it's confirmed we are at $37 right now, just on hopes and dreams.
NEUT36|When the announcement comes through.
NEUT37|I think $5060.00 is more than reasonable.
NEUT38|So we'll just have to see how it plays out.
NEUT39|That is what I'm thinking.
NEUT40|That is what I'm season.
NEUT41|I don't know, man, maybe we'll do a highly on video after this.
BULL42|They had quite the day today.
NEUT43|Anyways, that is it for this one.
NEUT44|"I will catch you in the next one, traders."""
