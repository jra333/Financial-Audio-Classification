BEAR0|"""In terms of cryptocurrencies generally, I can say almost with certainty that that they will come to a bad ending."
NEUT1|Now when it happens, or how, or anything else, I don't know, but I know this if I could buy long term puts like a buy a five year put.
NEUT2|On every one of the cryptocurrencies, I'd be glad to do it, but I would never short a Dimes worth, having thought about trading the futures to take a negative position of Bitcoin.
NEUT3|No, you would not do that.
NEUT4|No, there's no way.
NEUT5|There's no reason I get into enough trouble with things I think I know something about.
NEUT6|Why in the world should I take a long or short position or something?
NEUT7|I don't know.
NEUT8|I think about so.
NEUT9|You don't have to know what cocoa beans are going to do or or any other cryptocurrencies.
NEUT10|We just have to focus on 8 or 10 stocks.
BEAR11|That business is basically that we think are decent businesses, but I do think that I think what's going on definitely will come to a bad ending.

NEUT13|I have a Class 511 schools coming on Friday.
NEUT14|The questions will be on Bitcoin and I won't know the answers.

NEUT16|Well, that is true, I mean.
NEUT17|Two that would be much more interesting to the audience and that we were going to issue a whole series of cryptocurrencies tomorrow.
NEUT18|But we aren't, believe me, and we don't own any.
NEUT19|We're not sure that he will never have a position in him.
