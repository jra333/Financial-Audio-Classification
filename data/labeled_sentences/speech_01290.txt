NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today."
NEUT1|I'm going to be talking about Neo.
BEAR2|Neo has been down over the past month, 30% on the dates down 5% and almost a whole another person after hours.
NEUT3|Wow, the stock that everyone was talking about saying that would be the Tesla of China is not typically reacting how we thought it would wear, at least according to Tesla standards.
NEUT4|Before I get into certain opportunities with you guys, make sure you guys hit that.
NEUT5|Subscribe on like the video and comment below what you guys want to see in the future.
BULL6|Sony's recent Quarter 4 earnings came.
NEUT7|To a little bit of a shock to a lot of different investors.
BEAR8|They were showing pretty neutral numbers, although they did beat their earnings, they didn't beat it to the expectations of many Wall Street analysts.
NEUT9|If we go down here and we look at what they actually reported, they reported just under, they reported under their estimated earnings.
BEAR10|They did be in a few areas in their earnings reports, but their overall earnings per share was down and taking a look at this article right here, JP Morgan says don't say bye bye to Neo say bye bye.
NEUT11|What they're talking about here is for their quarter for gross profit, right?
BULL12|Here, they showed a profit last last quarter.
BULL13|Four for this quarter, for they showed a positive gross margin, which means that they're starting to show positive ITI and have positive income numbers.
NEUT14|That is huge.
NEUT15|Investors look very hard at financial aspects within a company before they invest in it.
NEUT16|They don't just say, hey, this app showing up, we should buy it.
NEUT17|They look at their balance sheets, income statements and financial statements to guess where the stock will go in the future.
NEUT18|I could go through that, but it's a whole different amount of calculations and stuff like that to kind of have an idea of where they'll be in a couple of years from now.
NEUT19|But the people on Wall Street really look at those numbers, 'cause that's how they invest.
NEUT20|If we go down here, we can see that their numbers were 150,000 units annually, and a single ship production model.
BULL21|The quarter one for this year, analysts feel confident in predicting that the deliveries will be more than double this year to 90,500 units or better.
BULL22|That is also a good thing.
NEUT23|We just want to see the delivery numbers.
NEUT24|The delivery numbers this year.
BEAR25|What caused it to go down was that they weren't on part of what Wall Street had expected.
NEUT26|If we go back over to Neo and we take a look at a longer term chart on the one year.
NEUT27|I'm going to use Robin Hood shirt 'cause it's really easy to show pivot points, but there's a pivot point at 40 and it didn't quite react how we wanted it to completely broke through that.
NEUT28|Now we're at 38, so our next step right now would be around $28.00.
BEAR29|If we don't find any consolidation or or resistance or support or anything like that until $28.00, then you can expect it to fall a little bit more.
BEAR30|Understandably, with the market conditions right now, there's not a whole lot of buying going on either, so that can also take a toll on Neo.
NEUT31|We need to be more optimistic for the future.
BULL32|We need to see some positive signs for more investors to hop into the market, but for right now, markets dead.
BEAR33|It's neutral and it's pretty devastating guys.
NEUT34|There's really not many opportunities.
BEAR35|Anymore in the stock market and I wish I could say that we could have seen more opportunities, but the overall market conditions right now in the OTC market.
NEUT36|Penny stock market options market long term market.
NEUT37|There aren't as many opportunities, so maybe you guys did that.
