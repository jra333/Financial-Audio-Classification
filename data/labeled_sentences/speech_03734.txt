NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMD."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here and good solid volume.
NEUT4|I'm not going to say massive volume, but good, respectable volume, especially when you combine that with the price movement.
NEUT5|So more of the story lot of people going to watch this one going into Friday.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up there above that $94.00 mark.
NEUT8|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 94.
NEUT9|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed.
NEUT10|Or anything like that.
BULL11|But yeah, if the price could say above that level, that would certainly be a massive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at everything from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line as long as line state or excuse me, as long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control of.
NEUT18|Visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yes and above 94 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all.
NEUT21|As long as the price is above that purple line, the bowl is 100% owned.
NEUT22|The chart as far as areas of resistance are concern.
BULL23|Big battleground here.
NEUT24|Going into Friday, right up there at that $96 mark.
BULL25|You can see that was as high as it got up on that spike from several days ago, and the prices wealth in striking distance.
BULL26|So yeah, if it can get up there and get a break up through that 96 that break in and of itself could really create some good upside buying pressure.
NEUT27|So we'll see what happens with going into Friday.
NEUT28|But All in all, any angle you look at it, great volume, great momentum.
NEUT29|So let's see how this one continues to play out on Friday.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird.
NEUT35|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT36|But in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
