NEUT0|"""Lower body."
NEUT1|We're talking now about Apple stock.
BEAR2|I was stuck.
NEUT3|Which is.
NEUT4|Or most of the stocks.
BEAR5|Stock markets, which is making a negative.
NEUT6|Move.
NEUT7|Is it a buy?
NEUT8|Are is it all about Junji to Wyatt?
NEUT9|This day is answer would be no, no way, and because it's still moving down and still.
BEAR10|Having a negative move, which in my opinion opinion the expectation for Apple.
NEUT11|Will be there now.
NEUT12|It's doing it's 277 comes from so dirty.
NEUT13|Under through 424.
NEUT14|Arrive.
NEUT15|And.
BEAR16|It goes down because of the.
BEAR17|Crash of the markets.
NEUT18|The two.
NEUT19|200 and.
BULL20|48 with grounds for it to move up for 22177 for short term.
NEUT21|The expectation it will.
BULL22|Apple stock will goes to about 200.
NEUT23|And it can still move forward.
NEUT24|100 and.
BEAR25|54 for medium term and we can wait and see, but it's really negative.
NEUT26|Dropped on now for apples.
NEUT27|Stop for this government.
NEUT28|Monsters can recover once is, so its target.
BEAR29|Is 200 and which is down target negative.
NEUT30|Fix a vision which it will be 200 and 150.
