NEUT0|"""Hi this is Thomas with like assets."
NEUT1|This is another video in this series covering the Wall Street Journal's new portfolio tool.
NEUT2|In this video I will show you how to add cost basis.
NEUT3|In My Portfolio I have one account set up my TD Ameritrade account is an automatic account.
NEUT4|When I set this account up portfolio use my TD Ameritrade credentials to make a secure connection and pull down the account history.
NEUT5|That TD Ameritrade provides.
NEUT6|Now, TD Ameritrade provided statement data going back two years.
NEUT7|I have owned some positions in My Portfolio longer than two years, so it is these positions that I do not have a cost basis for.
NEUT8|To fix this, I'm going to drill into my TD Ameritrade account.
NEUT9|I'm going to click the enter cost.
NEUT10|Link.
NEUT11|I will select the date that I made.
NEUT12|The purchase.
NEUT13|And I will click add.
NEUT14|And done.
NEUT15|So I just.
NEUT16|Entered the cost basis for the nine shares of Costco that I own.
NEUT17|I will give you one more example.
NEUT18|For Dow Chemical I have 22 shares.
NEUT19|Maybe I bought.
NEUT20|The shares on two different dates.
NEUT21|So on February 1st.
NEUT22|I bought 11 shares.
NEUT23|And then I decided I wanted some more.
NEUT24|On February 3rd and I bought 11 more.
NEUT25|The 22 shares that I own are now accounted for, and I can click done.
NEUT26|And I have my cost basis for both of these positions.
NEUT27|I can follow the same steps for my other positions.
NEUT28|Then when I click my timeframe.
NEUT29|Can accurately see how I'm performing.
NEUT30|So as you can see, it's very easy to add cost basis.
BULL31|"Thanks for watching this video."""
