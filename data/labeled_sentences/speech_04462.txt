NEUT0|"""Jim, we now have the."
NEUT1|We will have the biggest cannabis company as a Tilray and a pH.
BULL2|A merging this all stock deal like we value of almost 4 billion and we just talked to Boris Jordan yesterday of Curaleaf they're going to be surpassed in terms of I think size overall size.
NEUT3|Look this market Tillery 22 million shares.
NEUT4|Look, the younger people, not the institutions.
NEUT5|Love these stocks.
NEUT6|Irwin Simon over and over again.
NEUT7|He's profitable.
NEUT8|He talks about that grow generation.
NEUT9|I like that, but that's a roll up.
NEUT10|I want people to be careful of these.
NEUT11|Canopy has a lot of money.
NEUT12|Be careful because you really need federal legislation to make this thing work.
NEUT13|And so far I don't see Mitch McConnell endorsing it in the Senate.
NEUT14|The house they've got David remember, right now.
NEUT15|You can't take credit cards that no cash.
NEUT16|I mean, there's a lot of restrictions on it to make it so that.
NEUT17|It's not like Gambolling which is now in almost every state.
NEUT18|Yeah, and that's why they still want the federal to your point, even though state by state, they certainly are even states that you know Boris referred to it yesterday.
NEUT19|Is that Green Wave use all these states legalizing well every selected?
NEUT20|It's on the ballot approved until it becomes federal.
NEUT21|To your point, especially in terms of things like payment, it's it's yet to sort of see it's real growth phase that they were hoping for.
BEAR22|No, it'll be much and lost too much.
NEUT23|Just admit it, but yeah, I mean, I think Jim when this talk about speculation, I mean it's not as though it hasn't existed in our market prior to this current period.
NEUT24|Tell Ray was 150 bucks at one point before the stock had a bar.
NEUT25|So expensive.
NEUT26|Yeah, unfortunate run up there because what happened is it was a big short squeeze, but we should point out Irwin Simon Wren Hain Celestial.
NEUT27|And Africa will actually own 62% of the combined company even though till raise is the stock that's being used as the currency here.
NEUT28|Yes they were shareholders on 62% and he's going to run it.
NEUT29|Jim, he's going to be CEO this well, I had Mark Schuler on recently who is the CEO of Hain Celestial which was the company that Erwin did run very capably and look at that.
BULL30|There's a 52 week high up 3.5%, so I think our went over everyones on at 4:00 o'clock.
NEUT31|David.
BULL32|And I think that Darwin is a Consumer Packaged Goods guy and can really do a pretty good job.
NEUT33|Canopy, I urge people to look at that one if you want to do.
NEUT34|Cannabis canopy is going to have with the equivalent of taste.
NEUT35|Great, no filling, not less filling, no filling.
NEUT36|Tell me David, if you don't want to get a legal buzz, don't drive, but illegal buzz from a THC drink from canopy that tastes good.
NEUT37|She is legal, I'm I'll.
NEUT38|Give that a shot.
NEUT39|I'll bring a 6 pack.
NEUT40|Yeah, I think it is important to point out how small these companies are.
NEUT41|All right.
NEUT42|I mean the pro forma on this thing, US revenue or total revenues 865 million U.S. dollars?
NEUT43|That's pro forma last 12 months reported by each company.
NEUT44|In other words, if they were together, I mean, these are still tiny companies.
NEUT45|Snow, chewy.
NEUT46|New snow fastly new oh.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
