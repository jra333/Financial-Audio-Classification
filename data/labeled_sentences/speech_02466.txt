BULL0|"""Alright, so Disney is at $173.73 with a market cap of 314.54 billion which is amazing."
BEAR1|So Disney has just been knocking it out of the park.
NEUT2|They just keep going up and up and my by end point is reaching its end I believe.
NEUT3|Anything over 170.
NEUT4|If I had the money, I would throw it in Disney, but anything below 170.
NEUT5|I am going to keep buying if I have the money.
NEUT6|That's where I want to put my money.
BULL7|So this is good news.
BULL8|So Disney plus could be bigger than Netflix in the US by 2022.
BULL9|Disney hit a home run with Disney.
BULL10|Plus it's proven much more popular than anyone anticipated, leading management to raise its subscriber outlook, not just for its flagship streaming service, but its entire portfolio of direct to consumer products.
NEUT11|It now expects to reach as many as 350,000,000 subscribers across its streaming services by 2024.
BEAR12|That is an insane number.
NEUT13|If they do hit 350,000,000 subscribers, and that's because there's star streaming, and that what they're doing in India, that's why it's so big.
NEUT14|So if they hit that.
BULL15|That'll be amazing that I. I could see us at a market cap of 600 to 700 billion by 2024 an that's how I've always felt.
NEUT16|I think they are.
BULL17|They're on the verge in 10 years to hit a market cap of $1 trillion.
NEUT18|That's my opinion, but.
BULL19|If that were the case, that would be massive gains for me.
NEUT20|And if you check out my other videos, you'll see how Disney I am all in on Disney.
NEUT21|I'm I've invested the most money in Disney because I believe it's just.
NEUT22|It's an easy way to double my money.
NEUT23|Anything above that is just gravy Ann.
BEAR24|Now just Disney believes they're just going to hit massive amounts of subscribers.
NEUT25|And if you look at Netflix, Netflix is at 190,000,000, give or take an.
NEUT26|Disney is going to annihilate that, so any money I have anything under 170 I'm going to keep buying an I'll just keep doing follow up video.
NEUT27|So please subscribe and stay on top of Disney 'cause they're just knocking it out of park.
