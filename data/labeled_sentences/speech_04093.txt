NEUT0|"""David, let's begin with the inflation vector."
NEUT1|Now it is discrete and different than Europe.
NEUT2|With the Rising 5 year five year break even do you assume a trend towards rising and larger inflation and the next years to come?
BEAR3|I have a tough time believing that inflation is going to become a sustained problem.
NEUT4|At least the next I'd say one to three years.
NEUT5|You know the the output gap.
NEUT6|Or the differential between where aggregate supply and aggregate demand is in the United States.
NEUT7|Is far too high for me to be worried about inflation.
BEAR8|I know that it's become a bit of a narrative of late with the steepening yield curve and the increase in the break even levels.
NEUT9|My forecast is a little bit different, I think, than the consensus on this.
NEUT10|It doesn't mean that we're not going to go through a temporary.
NEUT11|Where some of these cost pressures in the material sector seep through.
NEUT12|That's been the case, but remember, inflation is a process.
NEUT13|It stuck, you know, you have to have continuously.
BEAR14|Accelerating price is not just a one off level shift and so I think that the market is overdone.
BEAR15|It basically think the narrative is overdone it on the inflation side.
NEUT16|I think it's going to be years before we see.
NEUT17|OK.
NEUT18|"I think date acceleration."""
