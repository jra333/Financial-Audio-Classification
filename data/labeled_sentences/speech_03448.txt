NEUT0|"""Well, this should come as no surprise."
NEUT1|The pandemic has made snackerz out of all of us, and a new report from Coca Cola has all the details on our snacking habits.
NEUT2|We've got.
NEUT3|Yahoo Finance is broke to Palma here to break it down for us in this week.
NEUT4|Brooks invites highbrook.
NEUT5|So tell us what we're seeing from this study.
NEUT6|So Christina lots happening with this study that we may not even expect that we're actually doing.
NEUT7|Like you said, it's really no surprise that we're snacking more, but when you take a look at these numbers, you'll be shocked that it's happening along all generations.
NEUT8|In particular, the most most that snacking is Gen Z and Millennials, stacking at 73%.
NEUT9|Genex also guilty of this as well at 54%.
BEAR10|And then boomers nearly half of boomers admit that they are snacking more during the pandemic.
NEUT11|Now Coca Cola also looked.
NEUT12|At the most creative snacks now, they did consider pizza as a snack which may being from New York.
NEUT13|I was a bit controversial about, but they did say that in the West and in the Southwest, Pizza is the most crave snack in the northeast that we're looking at wings in the Midwest.
NEUT14|We're looking at potato chips and in the Southeast they say that French fries are the most crave snacks.
BULL15|So big win there for our fav favorite fast food Giants.
NEUT16|Now, in addition to that I just want to emphasize what they said.
NEUT17|And how far people are willing to go to crave that?
NEUT18|You know, salty, sweet craving.
NEUT19|They're willing to travel over a one mile so people are really looking to stack more and willing to go to extreme extents just to fulfill that craving.
BULL20|Yeah, I agree with you Brooke.
NEUT21|I don't know if I would qualify pizza or even wings as a snack to be honest.
NEUT22|That is a meal.
NEUT23|Personally, for me at least in my house, I didn't think I was a snacker, but apparently I am according to that chart want to ask you about some of the innovations that we're seeing in snacking.
NEUT24|How are these brands essentially keeping folks coming back keeping their hands on those snacks?
NEUT25|Chris and I do want to point out that in Pepsico's fourth quarter earnings report, the CEO stated that people are really going to turn to a more experiential, you know snack and shopping experience.
NEUT26|You know, in the beginning of endemic we saw people rushing to stores with that panic driven shopping, but now they're really looking for innovation, and PepsiCo is jumping on that.
NEUT27|In January, we saw them release Cheetos Cheetos popcorn that is now earlier this month.
NEUT28|We see a lot of these companies teaming up with celebrities, so Dan Levy and Kate McKinnon.
NEUT29|Teamed up to drop toasty toes habanero their spiciest chip yet but the one that got the most attention are these Lady Gaga Oreos of course he's worked really hard to find when they first dropped but they're also bringing lots of attention for consumers and orium notably jobs, many flavors so lots of consumers rushing to source to capture them while they're still on the shelves.
NEUT30|Alright, thanks so much to Yahoo Finance is Brooke to Palma bringing breaking down all of those snacking habits.
