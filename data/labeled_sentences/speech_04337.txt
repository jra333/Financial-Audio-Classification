NEUT0|"""Hey, what's everybody?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to a brand new video.
NEUT2|In today's video, I'm going to have a look at the Walt Disney Company stock market and I'm going to share some other stuff from the CNBC news reporting to tell you guys more about Disney stock because I think it's a great time to invest in Disney stock, but that's not eat for this video.
NEUT3|I'm going to share some stuff that I think no one have made the video about yet, because Disney theme parks are opening so it's a great time to invest in Disney stock.
NEUT4|So first, I'm going to look at the charts.
NEUT5|Then we can go look at the news.
NEUT6|How the stock market is doing how their stock is doing, how the Disney reopening happened and all those stuff.
NEUT7|So if we look at the past day.
NEUT8|We can get an idea that the Disney stock did go up because Disney was closing and the Disney stock was very low and here let me just put it for the past four hours actually.
NEUT9|So right over here, past four hours, you guys can see the Disney stock picked up itself at 114.
BULL10|Went up to 122.
BULL11|That's a big gain.
NEUT12|Their went to 123 and now there's 122.45, so that's what I'm talking about.
NEUT13|What I'm meaning in this video is that the stock market did really go up and begin going out even though look their stock was actually high here at 1:40 they dropped because their theme parks everything was closed, but now they picked up themselves again because.
BULL14|You know the theme parks opened and all those good things happen and are up by $0.58.
NEUT15|Now that we know a bit about it.
NEUT16|I wanna share how from the start of the year they started on how they are right now so you guys can see the start of the year they were high because this quarantine ending was not here that much 148 then as soon as they start dropping then when does lowers the right over here?
BULL17|8585.76 Then then, because the theme parks opened, the went up again.
NEUT18|So potentially what this could mean is that as more theme parks open as hard as stock price is going to go and is more profit, we investors can make.
NEUT19|So now I want to look at the CNBC news so you guys can see this is from Sarah.
BULL20|Thanks, shadow to Sarah.
NEUT21|So Disney to start reopening its Florida theme parks.
NEUT22|With Magic Kingdom Animal Kingdom on July 11, so they haven't opened in Florida yet.

NEUT25|On Wednesday, Disney proposed a phased reopening on Walt Disney World's Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom on July 11th, Epcot and Hollywood Studios would reopen reopen on July 15th, so this is some of the key points which you guys can find on the CNBC news website.
