BEAR0|"""Hello everybody, my Garden Circle founder patron partners on Baba Gino so Amazon finally getting a close below its 200 day simple moving average has not happened in quite awhile."
NEUT1|Let's check last time it did happen and we'd have to go all the way back.
NEUT2|Two, let's see 2016 so February clothes blow it.
BEAR3|Then continued lower, finally getting back above it in at the end of February, just different both briefly, for a couple days, and then hasn't seen those levels.
NEUT4|Hasn't revisited the 200.
BEAR5|Got close a couple times but has not closed below it since that level.
NEUT6|So this is pretty significant.
NEUT7|Now we're going to see if next week it recreates the 200.
NEUT8|Have the retracements on here.
NEUT9|Key levels will be watching for the first key level.
NEUT10|Watching is about 1668 Area 1660 to 1668.
BULL11|It's also a 12 1/2 percent retracement from this big down move.
NEUT12|Next, major area will be watching then is about 1700 to 1716 and we have the rotations on coming down.
NEUT13|You see, the rotation zone is against it on a daily chart now.
NEUT14|Also check it in the weekly in a second so once you have the rotations on against it just on the way up is is buying opportunities so you know buying opportunity, buying opportunity, buying opportunity, buying opportunity.
BULL15|Now it's potential selling opportunities so in the.
NEUT16|Shoes on sell off in your rotation zone self, so these are the key levels.
BEAR17|The bottom of the rotations coming in 1740 and that will continue to drop pretty quickly that off the rotation zones coming in at 1800.
NEUT18|So major resistance now on a daily time frame is coming in right around 1800.
NEUT19|Check over on the weekly.
BEAR20|So also besides that 200 that we just closed below, you can see how it bumped off the 50 week exponential moving average and this is prior resistance right here.
NEUT21|So you had run up resistance in their weekly rotation zone, run up resistance, a little shelf here, and that's now support, so this is it.
NEUT22|Very, very key support.
BEAR23|You have the key moving average and prior price action providing support, so if it does drop below this I start even be watching.
NEUT24|For longer term, I'm not saying it can't rally first, but if we did drop below this key level, I'd be watching for 1491 and then all the way down to about 1400 is a possibility.
NEUT25|Now we also might get the.
NEUT26|Rotations on cross on a weekly chart has not happened yet.
NEUT27|That would be very significant and even more bearish, but we'll be watching next week to see how hard and fast this can bounce if it.
NEUT28|If we do get a bounce and see how hard it can get to just one list off these levels and also know where your stop is a key level for us to get it closed, but if it closes below 1600 on a weekly, it's not a good sign for Amazon, so keep that in mind and know where your stops are in.
NEUT29|Also know if you're going to be an aggressive buyer.
NEUT30|And this is not just a long term buy and hold, but you're somewhat trading it.
NEUT31|Know where your targets are so you don't just go away.
NEUT32|We're going to all new time highs, you know we're going to be watching for these studies.
NEUT33|Key levels on these retracements.
NEUT34|So if you're doing any dip buying in here, there's no key reversal pattern yet.
NEUT35|But if you're doing any dip by know where you're going to be dealing some offer at least aggressively moving up your stops in cases well from this week does not hold, so we have for you on Amazon will talk to everyone soon.
NEUT36|"Bye for now."""
