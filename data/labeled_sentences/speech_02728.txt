NEUT0|"""All of these economists were 160 IQ's to spend their life studying it."
NEUT1|Can you name me one super wealthy economists ever made money out of securities?
NEUT2|May just go down the list now.
NEUT3|No canes canes actually.
NEUT4|In his early years tried to make money in stocks by predicting what business would do, and he gave it up.
NEUT5|And then he went over to a gram type approach.
NEUT6|I mean, it's very interesting to read his history on this 'cause he thought he could by looking at various economic variables.
NEUT7|Pick what he called the credit cycle and make a lot of money in and he what broke a couple of times in doing it.
NEUT8|Had to borrow from people and then he settled on buying good businesses.
BULL9|Cheap that he understood and concentrating his investments and he did very well.
NEUT10|It's an interesting history, but if you if you look at the whole history of them, you know they don't make a lot of money buying and selling stocks.
NEUT11|But people who buy and sell stocks listen to him.
NEUT12|"Which is I have a little trouble that."""
