BULL0|"""Welcome back everyone and thank you for joining this technical analysis session here at the exam.com."
NEUT1|It's Monday, November 2nd and Christina Bethany, investment analyst and Euro Dollar would be the market we're going to look at today.
BEAR2|So looking at the daily chart, the pair has been quite bearish over the past week following the pullback near the bottom line of the ascending channel, the decline turned more aggressive below the 2050 day amaze.
NEUT3|Last weekend.
BEAR4|The market is currently trading near September's low of one point 1611 and slightly below the McLeod.
BEAR5|Having her fully retraced the latest rebound near side continues to weaken below its 50.
BULL6|Neutral market has still some way to go to reach the oversold area below.
BEAR7|30 handbag has slipped below back below.
NEUT8|It says zero and signal lines.
BEAR9|Moreover, the bearish cross between the 2050 day amaze remains in place so expectations are for the price to keep weakening in the short term.
NEUT10|But we also get more evidence about that from the from the reconcile line which is set to cross below the.
NEUT11|Public Anderson, so unless September slower one point 1611 act as a strong support.
BEAR12|I expect the decline to stretch towards the one point.
BULL13|15 level reactivating the downfall from the 1.20 oh Nine peak enter therefore bringing the case of adult training market back into play.
NEUT14|If one point 15 face to stop the sell off.
NEUT15|2 then I think the one point 1420 area could be a good place to look next given how restrictive this was during the period between 2018 and 2020.
BULL16|I know the price where to rebound around one point 1611 Fridays resistance of 1.17 could be tested again ahead of the 25th day amaze.
BULL17|Currently around one point 1765 higher.
BULL18|The pair may push harder to bridge the crucial area between one point, 8061 point 1880 and reach again the bottom of the ascending channel around one point 9030.
NEUT19|This time, so that's all for euro dollar today.
