NEUT0|"""In this video I will show you a cryptocurrency that most people have never even heard of, but has been red hot lately."
NEUT1|BitTorrent Token, also known by its ticker symbol BTT.
NEUT2|Most people are stuck only invested in cryptocurrencies that are more mainstream.
BULL3|Well, those are good and safer investments that are almost guaranteed to appreciate over the long run.
NEUT4|They would have the same potential for massive growth like a new project that has a revolutionary idea.

NEUT7|I also make videos on stocks and other investments and to my regular viewers.
NEUT8|What's up?
BULL9|Welcome back with that being said.
NEUT10|Let's jump right into the video.
NEUT11|Let's talk money.
NEUT12|According to the official website, BitTorrent Token is tokenizing the world's largest decentralized file sharing protocol.
NEUT13|As many of you may know, BitTorrent is a popular communication protocol for peer to peer file sharing P2P which enables users to distribute data and electric files over the Internet in a decentralized manner.
NEUT14|Well, most people don't know that they also have their own token.
NEUT15|I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT16|He should always be doing your own due diligence.
NEUT17|Let's take a look at the recent price fluctuation of BT in early 2021.
NEUT18|One BitTorrent token would cost between 31 hundreds and four one hundredths of a cent.
NEUT19|In other words, three or 4% of a penny.
BULL20|Since then, BT has gained a lot of traction.
BULL21|In our March 20th, 2021, BT hit an all time high of 0.395 cents.
NEUT22|That means that in the last two months, BTS 10X and all of a sudden PTT to 1 cent doesn't sound absurd anymore.
NEUT23|At the time of recording has been less than 24 hours since BT hit its all time high and the current price is at 0.3 cents in the last 24 hours, the prices fluctuated between 0.21 cents.
NEUT24|And point $0.39.
NEUT25|This coin is clearly volatile right now, and chances are by the time you watch this video the price might look significantly different in terms of market cap PTT ranks 38th in the crypto world.
NEUT26|Their market cap is currently around $3 billion.
NEUT27|Their coin supply has no cap and currently there are approximately 990 trillion coins in circulation.
NEUT28|So moving forward, what should you do?
NEUT29|This is not legal investment advice, but from my point of view, if I wanted to get in right now, it's a pretty risky time.
NEUT30|I'd probably start a small position during this dip, but buying slowly because of the current volatility.
NEUT31|If you believe in this project and see this as a long term investment, it will give you the highest probability for massive gains.
NEUT32|Time in the market beats timing the market most of the time.
NEUT33|So where do you even buy BT?
NEUT34|According to Coinmarketcap, BT is being trained on the following crypto exchanges.
NEUT35|Finance, wabi and kucoin.
NEUT36|"My price prediction for BT that by the end of the year will be worth 1 cent on the lower end and 1.5 cents on the higher end."""
