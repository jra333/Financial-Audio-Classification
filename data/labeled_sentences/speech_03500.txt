BULL0|"""It's well, good effects here and today we going over."
NEUT1|This play right here, he said.
NEUT2|How do you know that Amazon was going to **** out like it did this morning?
NEUT3|It was a player called this morning.
NEUT4|We ended up making about 120% on it.
NEUT5|That was like the Max profit people made more.
BEAR6|I actually had a bad entry on it.
NEUT7|But we did make a good amount in a few hours, so here's the play right here.
NEUT8|I didn't have any of these enabled.
NEUT9|So this is what I was looking at when I saw the trend.
NEUT10|Uhm?
NEUT11|You know?
NEUT12|The thing is, with with trading right now we know the market was dim because if we look at.
NEUT13|The the US 100 which is the NASDAQ and controls.
BEAR14|It controls tech stocks and Amazon's a text talk, and if you look at the one hour time frame we could see that it was bouncing up and down under the 26 day for awhile now and we knew that you know it's going to push down.
NEUT15|We're not seeing a break count right now.
NEUT16|Actually I'm seeing a breakout, but yesterday we were not seeing a break out so.
NEUT17|I'm going to go back to Amazon and we're going to look at the one hour time frame.
NEUT18|This is a very simple play.
NEUT19|First off.
BULL20|It broke under my resistance that I had opened.
BEAR21|I'm going to call right now moment now to answer that, but it broke under my 3:20 resistance and yesterday.
BEAR22|You know, yesterday morning it fell and it it stayed about.
NEUT23|It's about 380, so like I knew this was a cell as soon as it broke under that.
NEUT24|This was a heavy resistance to break.
NEUT25|And then after that.
NEUT26|It also stayed under the nine day, so if you're just watching this clearly, you know you open up, you buy when it's at the nine day.
NEUT27|If it breaks you.
NEUT28|So if it holds, you know you keep holding so you know we gotta, we caught a good $100 move down on it.
NEUT29|Which was 1000 bucks in an hour.
BULL30|I hope this clears things up for people in the alert room.
NEUT31|If it did leave a like.
BULL32|"It really helps out with the YouTube algorithm and I'll see you next time guys, peace."""
