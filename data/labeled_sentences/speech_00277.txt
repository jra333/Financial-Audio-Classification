NEUT0|"""The most important thing of the United States."
NEUT1|Is to do the fundamental things right?
NEUT2|We'll talk about that in a second and also to come together.
BEAR3|I'm most concerned about one side trying to beat the other side and doing damage because history has shown that when you get those gaps, those wealth gaps in the values, gaps and anger.
NEUT4|You do get demonstrations.
NEUT5|You get new, get violence, and you can move to the point that the respect for the system.
BEAR6|Is not good.
NEUT7|I have a you know principle which is when the causes that people are behind are more important to them than the system the system is in jeopardy.
NEUT8|So the the binging it, bring it together and making sure that we can do that I think is a paramount importance then what are the fundamentals, the fundamentals?
NEUT9|There's so many important fundamentals but let me go through the important ones.
NEUT10|Are you going to earn more than you spend?
NEUT11|So that you're going to build, do we as a country?
NEUT12|Are we going to earn more than we spend so that we build our balance sheets?
NEUT13|That's important for every individual.
NEUT14|For every company, every organization, and for every government.
NEUT15|You can judge the health by the financial health by those things.
NEUT16|Then you have to go to the fundamentals that produce those things and they start with educating your children.
NEUT17|Well.
NEUT18|Broad based.
NEUT19|I think broad based good public education and civility.
NEUT20|When I say education, I don't just mean do you know how to read and write?
NEUT21|And all of those things?
NEUT22|That's very important of course, but also to behave civilly with each other because societies that row in the same direction.
NEUT23|With a common mission like an American dream, work better and so I believe it starts with education and you know the basics.
NEUT24|Basically not what I was lucky to have.
NEUT25|I went to public school.
NEUT26|I had parents who cared for me, took love me into it, taught me some values and so much.
NEUT27|Those things are the most important fundamentals.
NEUT28|Save more than you know those things.
NEUT29|If we can do that, that will be the most important thing because.
NEUT30|"Wherever we are in relation to China or any place is going to be dependent on how we are with ourselves to do those fundamental things correctly."""
