NEUT0|"""Repeating our breaking news from this morning, Vikram Panduit, CEO of Citigroup is stepping down this morning."
NEUT1|We are joined now by Dow Jones Matias Ryker, who would cover Citigroup for Dow Jones and Matthias.
NEUT2|I want to ask you, not about Vic Panduit, but about my Corbett who will be the new CEO?
NEUT3|Who is this guy, Mike?
NEUT4|Was Vikram pandits fixer.
NEUT5|He built up over built down, actually City Holdings.
BEAR6|The division that Companded built to hold all the businesses and assets that the Companded failed.
BULL7|Where accessories were unnecessary harmful to city and painted, sraa Corbett has done by all accounts in an excellent job doing that.
NEUT8|He has sold these assets at.
NEUT9|Prices said weren't fire sale prices that was banned its mandate.
NEUT10|He has said that again and again and again we want to sell these assets.
NEUT11|We want to wind them down, but at a minimal cost to shareholders.
NEUT12|So that is this accomplishment that he will always joking.
NEUT13|I've met him a number of times and I was always joking.
NEUT14|You are essentially eliminating your own job and there was always this.
NEUT15|Knowing smile so we know why we see.
NEUT16|We know why he was not particularly concerned about that.
NEUT17|We had Sheila Bair in for an extended interview not long ago and she obviously she had a lot of conflicts during her time, emblematic of regulators having conflicts with Citigroup and her beef with it.
NEUT18|And it was he wasn't a commercial banker is my Corbett.
NEUT19|Is that his background or I guess my long way of getting my question, which is what is his background prior to?
NEUT20|Managing down some of these problem assets, he was at City.
NEUT21|He has been at city for for longer than Panda and he is probably more of a banker then Recommanded was who was really a capital markets investment banker.
NEUT22|He was at Morgan Stanley before that is what he knows.
NEUT23|Whether Mike or bad is.
NEUT24|A banker like John Stanford, Wells Fargo, or Jim Roura PNC.
NEUT25|That's another question in other words.
NEUT26|Is he really the man who came through the?
NEUT27|Retail banking channel where the quote with the commercial banking channel.
NEUT28|The question is, does that matter to City, which is obviously one of the biggest lenders in the world.
NEUT29|But it's so much more complex.
NEUT30|The question is, does City need somebody who understands the massive global operations, massive capital markets operations and how it ties into the commercial banking operations?
NEUT31|And in that sense, I think Corbett has has a really really good understanding of what City is about.
BULL32|"Great thank you so much for raising up here to join us Matthias."""
