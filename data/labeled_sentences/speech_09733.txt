NEUT1|Do you like this kind of content in terms of price, action and support and resistance lines please like and subscribe.
BEAR2|Alright, past two days we've had this run up we're currently above.
NEUT3|Our.
NEUT4|No.
NEUT5|To resistance line.
NEUT6|But this could be a false breakout.
BEAR7|With an, especially with the uncertainty with the election, we could have issues.
BEAR8|Or the stock can continue running up.
NEUT9|I think a lot of markets and certainty if we look at the stock and you know how I like where setups are where there's multiple support and resistance lines.
NEUT10|There's a couple ways we could potentially just get down, get to about one 1280.
NEUT11|And then at that point so we could gap down, get to about one 1280 and then potentially head up we could come down, consolidate here and head up.
NEUT12|Or if we start.
NEUT13|Or if we can as we trade, we break below this.
NEUT14|Then we could see some further selling.
NEUT15|I would be cautious.
NEUT16|I still think no one.
BULL17|12:50 is it is an important support line.
NEUT18|And if we do make a break for the upside, I would look at around 17 to 18 as some form of resistance, even potentially 19.
NEUT19|And then if we break above that.
BULL20|Then I could see us heading up higher, but there is a lot of uncertainty in the market, so be very cautious on what you're doing.
NEUT21|But yeah.
NEUT22|Today is going to be pretty interesting.
BEAR23|With currently with an undecided presidential election that can cause problems, but I would.
NEUT24|Just be cautious, don't get greedy and have a plan.
NEUT25|"Watch."""
