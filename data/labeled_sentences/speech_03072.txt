NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Did this analysis previously, so that is where the red and green lanterns were coming from.
NEUT5|But after today's price went definitely some updates that need to be made.
NEUT6|First thing to do is just a little house cleaning, get rid of couple of these lines.
NEUT7|Sure, these levels still pretend they're just not relevant right now, and from a presentation standpoint I don't wanna risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines are really look.
NEUT8|So let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible, but the first update that need to be made comes about based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance, so 265 is not going to be that key level to watch moving forward, and this rule played out.
NEUT9|Pretty perfectly.
BEAR10|I mean, the price came down here, broke down below it and then when the price try to get up you can see that right around this area is we're just could never quite get any sort of more momentum and then rolled back over from that area.
NEUT11|So I'm not saying the price could never get back above that location.
NEUT12|All I'm saying is that if the price does try to stabilize out and then work its way back upwards.
NEUT13|The big question mark, you know next week is going to be OK. First off, can the price even get up to 265?
BULL14|But more importantly if it does, is the price gonna have enough strength to be able to break above that level?
NEUT15|But then even more importantly stay above it.
NEUT16|So 265 definitely going to be.
NEUT17|A critical level that a lot of people will be watching next week.
NEUT18|From that angle of things.
NEUT19|Now, what about levels of support?
BEAR20|We're going to squeeze down the chart here because it's been quite awhile since the price went down this low.
NEUT21|But the first the love of sport to watch very closely now.
NEUT22|Going to be right here at basically where the price bounce off of today at 2:59 and then after 2:59.
NEUT23|If that level doesn't quite hold up next key level down there around the 257 mark.
NEUT24|So two 59257 next couple of key Battlegrounds watch moving forward.
NEUT25|But yeah, as right now things are looking very shaky, but we'll see if the price and try to get things turned around or not moving forward.
NEUT26|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT28|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR32|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT36|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT37|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT38|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT39|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT40|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT41|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
