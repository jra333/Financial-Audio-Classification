NEUT0|"""What is Meryl Witmer buying in 2014?"
NEUT1|I'm Jack Carter editorofbarrons.com and I'm here with Meryl Witmer, general partner at Eagle Capital Partners and of course, a longtime member of the Barron's Roundtable and I'll embarrass you by pointing out that you're also on the Board of Berkshire Hathaway with Warren Buffett.
NEUT2|So tell me, you've got you know, I always love your stock picks because you're you're not big on quantity, but you've got a pretty darn good record on quality.
NEUT3|You've got one pick for us.
NEUT4|What is it now you learn that from Warren Buffett five quality, right?
NEUT5|So so one pic today I have is Wyndham Worldwide.
NEUT6|Wyn is the symbol an it's a company that has three segments.
NEUT7|It has a hotel, franchise or business which is an amazing business.
NEUT8|They have a vacation exchange business which is called RCI.
BULL9|Also an amazing business.
NEUT10|They both have returns on capital of over 20% returns on tangible capital and then they have a vacation ownership business, otherwise known as timeshare.
NEUT11|And we think it's cheap and we think This is why there's an opportunity.
NEUT12|We like all three businesses, the Vacation exchange business also has very good returns, and I think importantly, people who buy the timeshares like having the time shares.
NEUT13|In fact, 80% of them re up for incremental time.
BEAR14|So we think that you know the timeshare business is hurting the overall value.
NEUT15|So looking at the numbers.
NEUT16|Yeah, we think it'll learn about 7:50 a share.
NEUT17|That's our target in two year 750 to $8.00 and two to three years of after tax free cash flow.
BEAR18|And that's assuming management continues to shrink the cap the way they have.
BULL19|It also assumes some growth in the businesses and if it does that, we have a target price between 95 and 119 a share.
NEUT20|It's currently about 72 and so that those earnings you mentioned that it's growing at roughly what kind of pace the earnings growth well?
NEUT21|You know there's some cyclicality to it, so I hate to put a number on the growth, but we think you know 5 to 10% is a reasonable amount for the after tax free cash flow now got you now?
NEUT22|This is not an unknown company.
NEUT23|What do you think it is that the market doesn't like about the company that you think is actually it's missing?
NEUT24|What is the market missing here?
NEUT25|We think that the investing class is a little snobbish about that timeshare business and they don't understand that for middle America, it's actually aspirational.
BEAR26|To own a timeshare and I think because of that they dismiss the business.
NEUT27|Also it has quite a bit of hitting hidden earnings power with its excess depreciation and amortization and some other aspects to the business.
NEUT28|So I think we think that's why it's undervalued and also they they really purchased in a lot of the cap and I think that has gone somewhat unnoticed on the street.
BULL29|Also, thanks very much.
BULL30|"Well, thank you."""
