NEUT0|"""Let's take them one by one, starting with the daily chart of Amazon."
NEUT1|See the red line at the bottom here.
NEUT2|That's the seasonal pattern.
BEAR3|The way Amazon tends to trade at this time of year, Williams points out that historically, the period from September through late November has not been friendly for Amazon.
NEUT4|Well, is not been the case.
NEUT5|The exactly like this now, and everyone's Freddie and giving up on Amazon will hold it.
BULL6|It's been able to rally in spite of the week seasonal pattern.
NEUT7|Didn't go all the way down, so you gotta imagine what happens when this pattern turns positive later in the week.
BULL8|I think it's going to be pretty amazing.
NEUT9|Next up, there's Walmart, the number two player in the E Commerce space.
NEUT10|Here's a company that's been making a fortune thanks to the pandemic.
BEAR11|Not only is Walmart and essential retailer mean they'll get a ton of business of covid cases, keep spiking, and governors are forced to shut down stores or do something to alleviate this incredible pressure.
BULL12|Walmart gets to stay open no matter what, which is why the stock was such a great performer during the first wave in the spring.
NEUT13|On top of that, the company spent billions building up its digital business.
NEUT14|Over the years there are great omnichannel operator now.
NEUT15|So what does this chart Kelly?
NEUT16|Well, the stock is routed in tandem with a strong seasonal pattern.
BULL17|Although even when the seasonals turned negative through July through September, Walmart kept climbing higher waves.
BEAR18|The seasonal forecast levels off for the next few months.
NEUT19|Normally one March not to go to play on the Holidays, but I'm betting this year could be different.
BULL20|As far as the chart goes, the stock rallied when the seasons were bad.
BULL21|It rallied when the seasons were good.
NEUT22|I bet it keeps rolling when the seasons are just OK.
NEUT23|I know we should probably sub target for that, but we're going to use Larry cases large bins so right and I talked about target at the top of the ship.
NEUT24|How about the daily chart of another one that's suddenly fallen out of favor Apple?
NEUT25|Well, this moves a ton of its own merchandise online.
NEUT26|These days, apples, more about the booming service revenue stream, though all the money they make selling you backup data, music descriptions and 30% cut, they take for the app stores.
NEUT27|Then it is about hardware.
NEUT28|Remember the the smaller developers under million are getting a break in that App Store for cut in half.
BEAR29|This year most consumers are flush because so many of the things we normally spend money on have been shut down.
NEUT30|It's not an experiential economy anymore if you're not going to vacation, go out to dinner, go to the movies or going to bowl game.
BULL31|The savings really do add up.
NEUT32|That leaves you with a lot of extra cash so you can only really spend on stuff and Apple makes some of the best stuff in the universe.
NEUT33|Now history doesn't give us a ton of guidance here, right?
NEUT34|Apple?
BEAR35|Seasonal pattern is pretty much flat for the next few months, meaning it could go either way.
NEUT36|But between the air pods, the watch, the new 5G enabled iPhone 12.
NEUT37|I'm willing to bet that Apple is a huge holiday season.
NEUT38|Still, you know, my view on this one.
BULL39|Apples are great long term story, especially with the more China friendly Biden administration taking office in January.
NEUT40|So there's no need to get cute here, just own it.
NEUT41|Don't trade it as always.
NEUT42|And how do I know about Biden?
NEUT43|Biden is 18 player teamed with the rest of our allies.
NEUT44|He doesn't want to go it alone, so I think that the Chinese would respect that.
NEUT45|Like it or not.
NEUT46|OK now how about Home Depot?
NEUT47|When you look at Williams, a seasonal pattern here, it's a lot more cut.
BULL48|Home Depot's had a fabulous year because when millions of people are stuck at home.
NEUT49|They have every reason to renovate.
NEUT50|It's the only way to stay sane.
NEUT51|Frankly, more we're doing it.
NEUT52|I mean, I told my wife is what's the matter with cesium?
NEUT53|What's matter with my daughters?
NEUT54|Don't cabbage, she's older.
NEUT55|We gotta get rid of.
NEUT56|We have to renovate.
NEUT57|And you know, we had to.
NEUT58|I guess we have to more important.
NEUT59|The seasonal forecast suggests that the stocks do for big Run.
