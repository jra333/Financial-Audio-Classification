NEUT0|"""Hey traders and investors that Serge Berger heard today, let's have a look at Netflix."
BEAR1|Stock is getting creamed today, had a lot of questions from folks after the company reported yesterday, and was down big in after hours trading already.
NEUT2|So let's have a look at it.
BULL3|First of all, on a long term perspective, we could see the stocks been rising very sharply since 2012.
NEUT4|However, that entire rise pretty much came on waiting.
BULL5|Strength or momentum in that sense, as the relative strength index essentially topped in January 2013 and everything.
BEAR6|Everything since then is making making a lower high.
NEUT7|So ever since the stock, particularly since it stopped in February, then it it should have been something to go to go crazy long or short.
NEUT8|And for that matter until you had some sort of signal which we never got until just now, but pretty much a stock.
NEUT9|It was more of a sort of trading stock than anything to do on a swing trading swing trading front.
NEUT10|So now let's have a look at the.
NEUT11|The daily chart where we get a little bit more information of what, what the, what the damage looks like.
NEUT12|Let me flip this into a daily.
NEUT13|I didn't see you basically obviously today with with just one scoop with broken below massively blow all the medium term moving averages and pretty much looks to me like gravity here should at some point over the ensuing weeks get this stock, probably towards a $300 area Huawei.
NEUT14|Well a lot of times when you when you have a moment momentum stock like this crater, there's there's follow through selling.
BEAR15|At least to some extent, particularly in the broader market, is is weakening as A and weak as it has been recently.
NEUT16|This is a different environment than it was in January.
BEAR17|Keep in mind, so I do suspect that the stock could fall back towards the March.
BEAR18|I'm sorry April lows just around the $300, maybe 310 mark, maybe 290 something like that, so I would.
NEUT19|Personally I'm looking to to to be a seller of the stock on any on any meaningful oversold bounces with defined risk.
NEUT20|Of course this is the stock that can move a lot, so you do want to.
NEUT21|Sort of, keep keep your keep stop losses of five to 7% because the stock can certainly bounce very hard, so you want any any exhaustion signs on any sort of oversold bounce.
NEUT22|Here, in my opinion, is something to sell and to get the stock back down 300 bucks.
NEUT23|Those are there more tactical traders and alongside I would say 300 bucks or so.
BULL24|Particularly the market starts stabilizing as well around that area, and it would be something worth the stock would again make sense and alongside and if we're potentially from move back towards 400, so I hope this makes sense.
NEUT25|Guys as always, if you got any questions.
