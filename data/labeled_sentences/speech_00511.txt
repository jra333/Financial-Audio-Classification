NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of vertexes ranged between $5.35 per share, an negative $8.58 per share."
NEUT1|How were these values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $5.35 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $5.35 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Now the high end for our our intrinsic value range.
NEUT5|Really.
NEUT6|There is no payment that we would have to do as a matter of fact, vertex would have to pay us.
NEUT7|$8.58 per share in order to make a transaction happen.
NEUT8|Now this is simply a function of their median 10 year net profits.
BEAR9|As you can see, seven of the last 10 years they have posted negative earnings.
BEAR10|This is not good for vertex, especially in light of the value investing framework that Benjamin Graham is laid out before us in the 1930s and 40s.
NEUT11|Benjamin Graham specifically mentions he says he writes to be wary of companies that post at.
BEAR12|You know, even one year of negative earnings, but in the last 10, the median is such that it's negative.
NEUT13|$112 million of net earnings.
NEUT14|So who are we to assume that the next 10 years are going to be any different than this figure here?
NEUT15|Therefore, the high end is really incredibly low, so if we're going to compare this to a share price, it's not going to make any sense.
NEUT16|But let's just take a look at market folly and see what what the market has to say.
NEUT17|You know the markets knocking on our door right now and they're offering a vertex for sale.
NEUT18|Well, what's the price for vertex?
NEUT19|And look at this $209.95.
NEUT20|Does that make any sense?
NEUT21|I mean nothing against Vertex Pharmaceuticals or their products, but I mean the price itself is just.
NEUT22|It's nonsensical.
NEUT23|What is it based off of?
NEUT24|PE ratio is .56 above where where it should be in order for for further investigation to be warranted, at least from a fundamental analysis perspective.
NEUT25|But $209 and just compare that to their net profit that net profit.
BEAR26|Is very low, it's negative, it's just.
NEUT27|It's not.
NEUT28|You know when I see something like this it's very easy for me to reject and hopefully you share the sentiment because you can see the reasoning you see.
NEUT29|The relationship between the share price and you know their actual fundamentals.
NEUT30|I mean, we're taking a look here at their ten year cash balance and their ten year net profit margin.
NEUT31|And that's where we're getting the intrinsic value range from.
NEUT32|So the reasonable thing here would be to reject because they're neither offering a safety of principle.
NEUT33|Nor an ample margin of safety for our investment.
NEUT34|However, if we're considering a binary decision such that it's either an investment in Vertex Pharmaceuticals or some alternative, then that alternative should be the Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT35|Now this is the same fund that Warren Buffett used to beat out the hedge fund guys in 2008.
NEUT36|He officially won the bet in 2018, and the bet was simple.
BULL37|It's just he parked a boatload of money in the in this fund, and he said, I bet you'll get a better return than you guys can hedging.
NEUT38|You're hedging your risk.
NEUT39|And they tried and tried and he eventually started winning in the 4th year and he never stopped winning since that year.
NEUT40|So I suggest that you guys invest or park your money here.
NEUT41|Don't leave it in a bank 'cause it'll get a higher return.
NEUT42|It'll be more productive in this index fund then in your bank and your savings account, an especially the vertex pharmaceutical stock.
NEUT43|Don't invest until these guys start posting some positive net earnings.
NEUT44|I mean, you want to see at least 10 years, a 10 year history of positive net.
