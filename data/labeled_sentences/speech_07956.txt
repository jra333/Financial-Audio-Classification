NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, and I don't mean to say the obvious, but I will anyway, just to establish some context, but a very impressive movement when you think about the fact that the price literally closed right there on Wednesday and all of a sudden the prices all the way back up there.
NEUT5|Any rational person.
NEUT6|So yeah, that was a very nice move, but that does lead to the more than valid question of.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of true power behind this problem?
NEUT8|And is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT9|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce, site move and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area and that area.
NEUT12|Actually I'll just use this line right here.
NEUT13|Is up here at the 129 mark now?
NEUT14|Why is 129 important?
NEUT15|Not sending all this was going to actually happen, but just for explanation sake, let's say the price comes down here to 129 behaves in that manner, then continues on down.
NEUT16|What would you have at that point where you would quite literally have the price?
NEUT17|Having gone right back to where it was inside of this big range right here, and I mean not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT18|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sound true power to strength or anything like that.
NEUT19|But I mean to be fair, no price can just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner, then starts to work way back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden what would you have?
NEUT21|Well, you'd have a set of those right here.
NEUT22|You'd have that settles down here if you envision each one of those as stair steps, well, hey, now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT23|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT24|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL25|Overtime, it's going to make progress.
NEUT26|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 129 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|The big battleground to watch moving forward into Friday can be right up there at the one 3150 Mark.
NEUT28|I mean, you just go through the history of the chart and you can see that area, generally speaking, has just rejected the price, time and time again.
NEUT29|So that'll be a big battle ground on Friday.
NEUT30|But All in all.
BULL31|Very impressive movement today.
BULL32|Let's see if the price can build up on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL37|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT43|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT45|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT46|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
