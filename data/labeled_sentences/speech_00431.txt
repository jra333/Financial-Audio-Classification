NEUT0|"""Explains why this makes sense from Sirius POV to merge with Pandora, SiriusXM, you know the largest satellite radio operator and Pandora's in the US is one of the largest music streaming companies, so I think John Malone who controls SiriusXM is saying we have an interest in this audio business."
NEUT1|We don't think the audio business.
NEUT2|The radio business is dead.
NEUT3|We actually think there's some life there, so I think they're looking to marry their in car.
NEUT4|Experience with SiriusXM to the streaming service of Pandora to see if there are some synergies there.
NEUT5|And it's even, you know.
NEUT6|It's also been reported that John Malone and and Liberty Media are actually taking a look at I heart communications, which is the largest terrestrial radio operator with about 1200 radio stations.
BULL7|So there's clearly some interest from John Malone in the traditional radio and audio and streaming business, and is serious talk his way up.
NEUT8|So buying it in stock in some ways, a discounted price because the stock is way up at the same time.
NEUT9|Does this get him to scale compared to a Spotify convert to an Apple?
NEUT10|No, it doesn't.
NEUT11|In the streaming business it does not mean you have to really take a look at.
NEUT12|As you mentioned, Apple in the business.
BULL13|Spotify in the business, but this certainly gets them in the game and it gives him an opportunity to see about.
NEUT14|Is there some way to leverage their serious platform and their subscriber base there with the streaming business?
NEUT15|If there is a go shop.
NEUT16|Do you feel like there's going to be another buyer coming in?
NEUT17|I do not.
BEAR18|Pandora stock has been, you know, very weak.
BULL19|You know over the last several years, again, because of the competitive issues and there's been ample opportunity and SiriusXM already.
NEUT20|They have a convertible preferred stake in Pandora that's convertible to about 15% equity.
NEUT21|"So this is something that I think the marketplace thought might occur, that we'd see serious step up here to buy the remainder."""
