BEAR0|"""Desperate migrants looking to cross illegally into the United States are now turning to Facebook, where human smugglers are posting ads for their services."
BULL1|Thousands of dollars for what they call a safe journey into the United States.
NEUT2|One example, translated from Spanish travel from Mexico to the United States.
NEUT3|It costs $8000 hundred percent safe, crossed through Matamoros.
NEUT4|That's a town along the Mexican border with Texas.
NEUT5|You walk one hour after an automobile until you arrive with your family.
NEUT6|But of course, posts like that are often misleading at best.
NEUT7|NBC's Julia Ainsley.
NEUT8|Now Julia you reviewed dozens of these posts.
NEUT9|Are they contributing to this surge?
NEUT10|Well, yes, that's what the Biden administration says.
BEAR11|And that's what internal DHS documents show that they are very worried that there are social media posts that are getting out wrong information about their policies and also encouraging more people to make this journey.
NEUT12|And often it is very dangerous that image that they portray the 100% safe journey that hardly ever happens happens.

NEUT16|Well, Julia Facebook took these posts down as I understand it, after you flagged them, has the Biden administration address the social media aspect of this?
NEUT17|This surge of migrants?
NEUT18|That's right, Facebook takes down anything that is flagged to them, but of course it's a game of whack a mole.
NEUT19|Because these are just everywhere on Facebook and across social media.
NEUT20|The Biden administration is actually tried to use Facebook and their advantage by posting ads on there, telling immigrants not to come, that the border is not open and really highlighting the same policies that Cal Perry's saying that they will be expelled.
NEUT21|Unfortunately, it's a matter of volume, and as we know, misinformation can spread much easier than the truth when it comes to social media.

NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
