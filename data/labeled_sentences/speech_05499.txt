NEUT0|"""Boom WhatsApp, investor Maniacs, Knight Rider here and today we got the Arnie shared on go back to go get our swole on at the gym but first we go and get are swollen with our bank account."
NEUT1|That's where it really matters.
NEUT2|That's where you really want to be swollen.
NEUT3|Hey, we're going to get swole with Facebook.
NEUT4|We're taking a look at Q4 2018.
BULL5|Analysts were looking for $2.17 earnings per share on a gap basis.
NEUT6|That's the real earnings.
NEUT7|The whisper number was $2.26.
BULL8|Facebook beat handedly with $2.38 at 10% upside, surprise, what analysts expected revenues to come in at 16.4 billion.
BULL9|Facebook beat by about 3% and reported 16.9 billion.
NEUT10|You can see this beautiful 11% pop that the stock had.
BULL11|It was a fantastic quarter.
BULL12|Alright, let's go ahead and take a look at some of the numbers of revenues were up 30% year over year.
BULL13|Nice full year 2018 revenue came in at 55.8 billion, up 37% year over year.
BULL14|Income from operations was 7.8 billion, up 6% year over year and full year 2018 was 24.9 billion up 23% year over year.
BEAR15|Operating margins were down from 57% to 46% year over year due to all the increased spending.
NEUT16|Remember back when they had that big old data breach and they're like we're going to spend anything it takes on security.
NEUT17|Well, that's what we're seeing.
BEAR18|We're seeing the consequences of that.
BULL19|However, due to the effective tax rate going down from 43% to 14% for the quarter year over year, thanks to the tax cuts and JOBS Act of Trump, we can now see that net income is up 61% year over year to roughly 6.9 billion as opposed to 4.3 billion the year before.
NEUT20|Remember, so do the tax cuts.
BULL21|We're seeing a 61% increase in earnings even though our income from operations is only up 6%.
BULL22|That is pretty awesome.
BULL23|Daily active users were 1.52 billion on average for December, an increase of 9% year over year.
BULL24|Monthly active users were 2.32 billion as of December 31st, an increase of 9% year over year 2.7 billion people now use Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp or Messenger each month and more than two people use at least one of the services every day on average.
NEUT25|Also note that Cash Cash equivalents and marketable securities.
NEUT26|Or 41.11 billion.
NEUT27|That's about 8% of the entire market cap of Facebook, so make sure you take that into consideration when you buy the stock or don't buy it or whatever.
BULL28|But hey, I think right now the stocks are buy.
NEUT29|I think that a lot of the problems of Facebook are in the past and you're getting a good deal to get in right now.
BULL30|"I hope you guys have a great day."""
