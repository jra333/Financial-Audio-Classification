NEUT0|"""What's going on YouTube?"
NEUT1|This is Vinny from the investment club.
NEUT2|I'm going to jump right into this one.
NEUT3|Let me start off by saying I love Disney.
BULL4|It's a great company to own.
BULL5|Long term now was upset when they cut the dividend, but I understand these are extraordinary times and I believe the company knows what's best.
NEUT6|It's gone.
BULL7|Excellent management team and I know the dividend will come back when things are back to normal and I'm glad the company is taking steps to shore up its balance sheet, so I don't know if you've heard of these squish, mellow things.
NEUT8|They're like little stuffed animals that I guess people are into.
NEUT9|They released a baby Yoda one, and it was sold out in pre sales.
NEUT10|In the first 48 hours.
NEUT11|So anyway, these squish mellow things of baby Yoda are coming out September 24th exclusively at Walgreens.
NEUT12|Wait, what interesting could be good for Walgreens stock anyway?
NEUT13|Disney will be making money off Star Wars until the end of time up next, so I briefly touched on this in the last video, which I'll link in the description below.
NEUT14|I'm very interested to see how people respond to the upcoming Mulan release on Disney Plus, which will be later this week.
NEUT15|Basically, Disney is bypassing theaters and releasing Mulan for $30 to Disney Plus subscribers, so you have to be a Disney Plus subscriber.
NEUT16|And pay $30 to see the movie.
BULL17|It was expected to bring in more than $1 billion in revenue before the theaters were shut down.
NEUT18|The film will, however, still premiere in theaters in other countries that do not have Disney, plus, including China.
BEAR19|Interestingly enough, Comcast actually did this in March with the Trolls World Tour and it went on too far, outperforming the prequel, which was released in theaters in 2016.
BULL20|So it's definitely a lot of potential for this one, and I think Disney will prosper greatly if this is a hit.
BEAR21|I think the entire film industry will change, and movie theaters will be in even bigger trouble, so the quarterly report showed that.
BEAR22|Pretty much everything from the theme parks to movie releases to sporting events and even merchandise sales have been negatively affected as everything has been shut down.
NEUT23|It's hard for Disney to bring in revenue with everything closes with the exception of Disney Plus, so I won't spend too long on the financials.
BEAR24|Revenue was down 42% year over year.
NEUT25|If you look at the top here though, it states that the direct to consumer service has reached over 100,000,000 paid subscriptions globally.
BULL26|Disney CEO said that they see their direct to consumer strategy as the key to future growth, and I think this is great.
NEUT27|They recognize a trend and are going with it.
BULL28|Once things return to normal, Disney will be bringing in more money than ever with both their theme parks and direct to consumer paid subscriptions.
BEAR29|On top of all their other streams of revenue for the time being, I think Disney plus in this direct to consumer approach is a silver lining and otherwise bleak situation.
BEAR30|So even though Disney revenue is obviously down a lot, but if Mulan is a hit, Disney will benefit greatly while $30, in addition to an already existing Disney Plus subscription, may sound like a lot to a big family, this probably is cheaper than actually going to the movie theater if we take a quick look at some of the endless assets that Disney owns.
NEUT31|We see here that they have Walt Disney Studios, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, 20th century.
NEUT32|If we go down to their media networks, they own ABC News, the FX Networks National Geographic is 73% state ESPN 80% stay 50% holding in the A&E networks which include Lifetime History Channel.
NEUT33|Disney even owns a stake in Draft Kings.
BULL34|They have done a good job of bundling assets.
NEUT35|I'm sure you've seen how you can get Disney.
NEUT36|Plus Hulu and ESPN plus all in the same plan.
BULL37|This is great marketing as between the three there's content for the entire family.
NEUT38|Disney owns so much, it's become a massive media company that owns the rights and licensing to so many popular franchises.
NEUT39|As we've seen in the last couple of weeks.
NEUT40|All it takes is 1 little spark to send stock prices to the moon.
NEUT41|I think Mulan in this new format could be that spark.
BULL42|I think the companies focus on direct to consumer is perfect for the current climate and will pay off immensely for them in the long run.
NEUT43|So I will be buying and holding Disney for the long term.
BULL44|I'll be adding to my Disney position ahead of this week's Mulan release.
