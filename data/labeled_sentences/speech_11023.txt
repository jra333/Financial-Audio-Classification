NEUT1|December 3rd.
NEUT2|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions.
NEUT3|What's next for Nio?
NEUT4|Alright, let's get started.
NEUT5|Neo NYSE NIO stock seems to be the hot topic on everyone's lips as of lately Anio gave space to a slew of special purpose acquisition companies and quickly inspired other players in the EV space.
NEUT6|An Iowan it CV trend will not end anytime soon.
NEUT7|But what is next for NIO after this wild week?
BULL8|Hubs analyst Paul Gong stated that he feels NIO is still the leader in autonomous vehicle initiatives.
BULL9|NIO has climbed an astronomical 1146.51% year to date that's despite novel coronavirus woes at the start of 2020, when we sum everything up.
BEAR10|NIO is doing great despite a temporary drop in price.
BULL11|In fact, this just provides another buying opportunity.
NEUT12|Here's why there are a few aspects behind Neo that helps set it apart from other companies in the EV crowd.
NEUT13|The core investment thesis behind Neo is quite simple.
NEUT14|The purchase of electric vehicles is increasingly popular around the world.
BULL15|As Neo taps into a market that many other players have yet to penetrate more broadly, it is leading thus far, and as more people in China, the country with the world's largest population by cars more will likely purchase an electric vehicle.
NEUT16|There are estimates that NIO will encompass 49% of the world's EV market by 2029.
BULL17|As such, NEOS vehicles are increasingly in demand, and that makes the stockers strong long term play on the EV trend.
BULL18|This basic thesis is backed by strong earnings results in its most recent quarter, deliveries rose 154% year over year to record high levels.
BULL19|Average sales price on those vehicles rose 2% total revenues rose nearly 160% year over year, also to a record high.
NEUT20|All of these are elements that separate Neo from the other trending EV plays like Fiska NYSE FSR, just to name an example, according to one analyst, Nio is not a startup.
NEUT21|NIO is a real company with real products.
NEUT22|Money in the bank and real sales.
BEAR23|As we learned on Tuesday, those sales are still growing quickly with all this good news, why is NIO down?
BEAR24|NIO is down due to factors that have nothing to do with Nio's Brandon accompany rumors of fraudulent behavior.
BEAR25|Companies like Candy and a new bill from US are causing stock prices to be lower than expected.
NEUT26|You can compare NIO situation to a straight A student who has rumors and suspicions spread about their actual grades.
NEUT27|Anio received some barates their peers, but then when you look deep into their portfolio you see that they are actually a straight A student.
BULL28|Not only is nio a straight A student, but they have been raising their grades even more by doing extra credit.
BEAR29|Now with the news of Candy, which has nothing to do with NIO and the US bill, which NIO is currently complying with, you see that NIO is down not because of its strong grades fundamentals, but rumors and hearsay from outside forces that do not weaken an IO as a brand or a company conclusion.
NEUT30|What next?
BULL31|Fenyo, according to Peter Oswald, an analyst from Suncrest Bank, another rally is up coming soon.
NEUT32|What makes him so sure one thing is seemingly guaranteed in the years ahead, more people will buy electric vehicles in Chinese, consumers are bound to be leaders in this market.
BULL33|An iOS fundamentals guarantee that stock will keep running higher.
BEAR34|This recent dip in Neo is just another opportunity to buy the stock at a low price.
