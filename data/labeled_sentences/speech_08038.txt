NEUT0|"""Scott, when is the best time to start investing at Ryan Warren Buffett?"
NEUT1|Who's the world's most successful and best known investor?
NEUT2|Started investing 11 issues.
NEUT3|Biggest regret was hitting start earlier which of course is.
NEUT4|Is it a Warren Buffett?
NEUT5|Folksy wisdom slash humor the best time to start would have been 10 years ago that the value of compounding means the longer you can invest for the long.
NEUT6|You can make your investment horizon.
NEUT7|The earlier you start.
NEUT8|The lighter you leave it, the more money you're going to have.
NEUT9|That's just the math of it, so that's the best time to start the second best time is today, 'cause if you haven't yet started, you haven't put enough aside.
NEUT10|You can't change the past where you can change is the future, and without sounding too kind of corny and Hallmark gift card or greeting card, the future starts today.
NEUT11|And so if you think about the value of waiting another year, another choose another five years.
NEUT12|You might only get a small return between now and, say, 2025, but those same 5 is the back end of your investing career that could.
NEUT13|Cost you the best part of half of your potential investment returns by waiting another five years.
NEUT14|Now you don't feel it now.
NEUT15|You'll feel it then, and so we basically it costs you five years worth of retiree Billy or five years of common, even more wealth where you want to spend it.
NEUT16|Give it to kids.
NEUT17|Give it to charity, use it to fund a lifestyle.
NEUT18|Start today.
NEUT19|Today is always, always, always the best time to start.
NEUT20|Then it's time to add your investment portfolio so the message to take away is then that if I'm a 20 year old starting investing today, that is the best thing to do.
NEUT21|If I'm 30 or 40 years old, it's not too late.
NEUT22|Correct, if you're 55, it's not too late.
NEUT23|You will limit the amount of compound returns you can get, but absolutely start as early as you possibly can.
NEUT24|Put aside whatever you can.
NEUT25|It's hard to think that far ahead like you're 20.
NEUT26|You're thinking, well, hang on.
NEUT27|I think you 45 years into the future, like I kind of conceptualize that I get I really get it.
NEUT28|So if you just trust me if nothing else just trust me on this one.
NEUT29|This one thing please start investing right now, your future I promise you will thank you as well.
NEUT30|Your kids and grandkids.
NEUT31|And can you give me a rough sense?
BULL32|I guess of how much the market actually is expected to return.
NEUT33|Yeah, so we were really careful with predictions because as the.
NEUT34|The legal Eagles will tell us there's no, you know passwords is no guarantee.
NEUT35|What I will say is over the long term over decades, and wishing more than a century now the market, about 10% a year depending on what index, what start date?
NEUT36|There's some.
NEUT37|There's some puts and takes, but call it 10%.
NEUT38|That means you can double your money, but every seven years, so again, do multiples of seven if you can invest for 42 years, that's six times your double its 100 to 200 to 408 hundred, 600 and 3200 bucks from 100.
NEUT39|That's $3100.00 of profit.
NEUT40|If you start with 1000.
NEUT41|That's very true.
NEUT42|$1000 If we start with 10,300 and $20,000, the value of that becomes phenomenal.
NEUT43|If you can start today and had regular and the effect is obviously going to be a whole lot better if the market can return that much compared to stashing it a bank account at the current rates, I think sometimes not taking enough risk is the biggest risk you take.
BULL44|Absolutely thanks God.
BULL45|"Thanks Ron."""
