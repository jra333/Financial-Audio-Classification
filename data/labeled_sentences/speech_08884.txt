NEUT0|"""Also guys, this is a quick update on AMC stock."
NEUT1|It's your boy will and I'll give you guys my AMC stock forecasts and predictions that I see going forward.
NEUT2|Let me zoom in a little bit.
BEAR3|OK, so AMC stock did have a push up but then it came right back down and closed right by the open.
NEUT4|OK so the open was 880, five $8.85 and then it closed right around where is $8.87.
BULL5|So I was getting very excited when I start seeing AMC push up.
NEUT6|Because I only want to get in on that push up area and I also think it wants to go above $10.00.
NEUT7|So I was trying to get in around this $8.00 area, but I waited because as I said, the stock of a volatile you never know and then it came right back down so I'm glad I waited.
NEUT8|I am looking for an entry to get in around $8.00 area and exit above $10.
NEUT9|I'll probably get 100 or 200 shares on that and then exit right above that.
NEUT10|This so that would be around.
NEUT11|A 20% game which is nice for me.
NEUT12|So that's what I'm waiting for.
NEUT13|This is an area that I was going to buy off of if it came down here.
BULL14|It came close but didn't quite hit it, so I was just waiting now and now I am looking for some up movement to go above $10 because I do think it wants to go above there.
NEUT15|So right now we just have to play it by ear by ear and just see how the stock moves.
NEUT16|Like I said, have your risk management.
NEUT17|How much know how much you want to put in the stock?
NEUT18|Set that money aside and then if you see potential you can just start averaging in.
NEUT19|So you don't put your whole the whole money you want in the account in one like 1 price area, right?
NEUT20|So say you start putting some here.
NEUT21|You put some here.
NEUT22|They put some here and then you would X up here instead of waiting and then put it all here and then we got slammed.
NEUT23|OK, Miss you guys play this stock very carefully.
NEUT24|I am looking at it every day and if I see a nice entry that I see fit I will send that out on my Patreon page.
NEUT25|Link down below if you want to know what I'm buying and selling, but that is it for this quick update, so make sure you guys like the video, not just a recommendation and buyer.
NEUT26|So anything this educational purposes only.
