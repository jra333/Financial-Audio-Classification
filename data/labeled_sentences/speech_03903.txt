NEUT0|"""Knowing the fundamentals of our government and our history are essential for having an informed and effective citizenry."
NEUT1|Yet shockingly few Americans know about these basics.
NEUT2|Here's a simple way to remedy that.
NEUT3|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT4|Countless Americans have been using online services to learn more about their ancestry, yet few people today know the basics about our own country.
NEUT5|That is our system of government and our history.
NEUT6|Having elementary knowledge of what makes the US tick, so to speak and why it has been a magnet and an inspiring example to countless numbers of people around the world for over 2 centuries.
NEUT7|Is important for American citizens to understand, which is why we require those immigrants who want to become citizens to study and pass a test on our history and our form of government.
NEUT8|Yet for years, most of our schools have been derelict in teaching kids or used to be called civics.
NEUT9|The fundamentals of the US.
NEUT10|This abysmal ignorance is shocking, but there is a simple solution.
NEUT11|Have our schools teach civics based on the naturalization test.
NEUT12|Given immigrants who want to become U.S. citizens before gaining citizenship, and immigrant must learn the essentials of our form of government and the essentials of our history.
NEUT13|That candidate has to study.
NEUT14|And absorb the answers to 100 questions.
NEUT15|This person will be S10 of them and must get at least six of them right to gain citizenship.
NEUT16|Areas and questions for this naturalization test include principles of American democracy, such as what does the Constitution do?
NEUT17|What are one of the rights protected by the 1st Amendment?
NEUT18|What is the Declaration of Independence?
NEUT19|What stops one branch of government from becoming too powerful?
NEUT20|What are the two parts of the US Congress?
NEUT21|What are one of the four amendments to the Constitution about who can vote their history?
NEUT22|Questions such as what is one thing Benjamin Franklin is famous for?
NEUT23|Why did the colonist fight the British who did the US fight in World War Two?
NEUT24|What did Martin Luther King junior do?
NEUT25|Their questions about geography such as name, One state that Borders Canada and name one US territory?
BEAR26|It is shameful that newly minted citizens know far more about their new country than most of us.
NEUT27|Here the civic test for naturalization should be a core course in our schools.
NEUT28|I'm Steve Forbes.
