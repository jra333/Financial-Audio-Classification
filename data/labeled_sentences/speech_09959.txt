BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Today I will be talking about HOFE stock.
NEUT2|I will be telling us if you should buy it or not and where.
NEUT3|I see the stockroom for today and tomorrow.
NEUT4|So yeah, let's get into it.
BEAR5|So this talk yesterday broke around $5.77 at the highs.
NEUT6|I started at $3.10.
NEUT7|And it broke around.
NEUT8|Follow this very sentence.
NEUT9|So premarket $4.92 an if it does break $5.
NEUT10|You could see photos in $0.25 if it breaks puddles and 35 center because he sounded $6.25 and up, but if it breaks $7.00 we can see either 8 or $9.
NEUT11|I mean, in my opinion, premarket sit down.
BEAR12|So just based on pure market I think is going to drop more, but if it does.
BULL13|Start to break higher like we could see higher you know price I could save up $6.
NEUT14|Play this, you know safely, very volatile center penny stock and put in money that you can afford to lose.
NEUT15|And that's just my opinion on the stock.
NEUT16|And yeah, it doesn't take a look at this chart for now.
NEUT17|He has one.
BEAR18|Hot charting is so annoying.
NEUT19|July 20th St Hayden.
NEUT20|$9.
BEAR21|Ever since we're having a downtrend.
BULL22|Recently picked up a uptrend and the volume jumped a lot, almost 300,000,000 volume which is insane 'cause it used to trade at.
NEUT23|Is it true that around like couple thousand volume?
NEUT24|So yeah, my opinion it could be a good stock to invest in if it breaks $5.25 and.
NEUT25|Set a stop loss so entry point should be at $5.30.
BEAR26|Stop loss $5.05.
NEUT27|That would be my stop loss and afterward enjoy refreshing subscribing.
BULL28|"Coming up for more."""
