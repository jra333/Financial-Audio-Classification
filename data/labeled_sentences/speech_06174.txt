NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Cognizant is range between $6.69 per share and $51.39 per share."
NEUT1|How were those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $6.69 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have 669 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Paying 5139 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings.
NEUT5|So a price of $51.39 per share represents the fractional payment.
NEUT6|We'd all have to pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT7|Now this is a conservative way to value a company that is different from calculating its price to earnings ratio.
NEUT8|But this brings up the next two questions.
NEUT9|What does Cognizant do and what are they currently trading at today?
NEUT10|Well, to answer the last question, they're trading at a price of 7388, which is immediately.
BULL11|While it's well beyond our intrinsic value upper bound, so definitely it's deflating to see.
NEUT12|But it's better that we know now.
NEUT13|Cognition is an American multinational product LED digital Corporation that provides digital products and IT services, consulting, etc.
NEUT14|According to Wikipedia, but that's kind of where we stop.
NEUT15|We would only investigate further, spend more time on this company if this price was a favorable one.
NEUT16|Will a bet or a bolster our assumption or our suspicion that they are in fact overpriced by looking at the price earnings ratio?
NEUT17|27.39 is 7.39 points above where we would want it to warrant further investigation.
BEAR18|Further research, so we would wait until this price drops beneath our upper bound of 51.390.
NEUT19|Fifty $1.39 per share.
NEUT20|That would then enable us to dig a little deeper and cognizant, but it's not going to happen today.
NEUT21|Now if you were thinking of an investment in Cognizant.
NEUT22|Or some alternative that's a bit healthier.
NEUT23|Don't keep your money in the bank guys.
NEUT24|Put your money into Vanguard 500 index fund.
BULL25|It'll earn ya 12.98%.
BEAR26|Trailing 10 years performance.
NEUT27|So put it there.
NEUT28|Low variance, low beta on this growth rate.
NEUT29|So definitely check that out.
