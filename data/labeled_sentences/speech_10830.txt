BULL0|"""Hello and welcome."
NEUT1|This is the market wrap I am are gonna be.
BULL2|Verse turned out to be another session where strength returning to Indian markets and this was perhaps or surprising considering we were looking at a little bit of weakness earlier on the section.
NEUT3|As far as the benchmarks are concerned, we've seen a 1% advance here and if he's back about the mark of 10,800 or what we have seen is this is largely on the back of.
NEUT4|Darko State Bank of India and Bajaj Finance.
NEUT5|The kind of gains of the companies have showed well the likes of something like an ECS Limited or Tata Steel is not too far behind, which is why we're looking at that strength.
NEUT6|As far as benchmark score.
BEAR7|On the losing end, we have some weakness in bought the Infratel Coal India Tech Mahendra NGC the sound the usual suspects, but it's turned out to be a good day of trade for the benchmarks.
NEUT8|Overall, when it comes to some of the names of broader markets coming down PNC 500, we have about 3 gainers, two losers.
BULL9|Difficult advancing by around 12% District Carbogen advancing and locked in an upper circuit off 10% we have key industries granules doing so well.
BEAR10|That's up around 9.2% as well are being from Hindalco as well as Neil, all advancing in trade with a lot of momentum and on the losing end we have some weakness in MPC.
BEAR11|Essentially fly running green locked in another lower circuit of 5% future retail.
NEUT12|Sterling Biotech or Max Yuan.
BULL13|The likes you know versus locked in the lower circuit around 5%, but on the whole it's turned out to be a great day of trade for those who are long in the market specifically, some of those talks which are looking at continued up movements.
BULL14|You know, if you consider the stocks beyond just the benchmarks, a handful of names which are well coming up I today is she big which estimate which is up around 9% IOL chemicals is are gaining by around 9% as well in Gulf oil lubricants on the back of heavy volumes.
BULL15|I'm showing a lot of institutional activity happening there that's also up around 6%, so we'll be watching out for some of these names as we move into trade in over the next few days.
NEUT16|A very quick look at the futures and options space.
NEUT17|With the NIFTY has moved about 1000 Barney 10,800.
NEUT18|Well, we've been talking about the 10,500 level as the one, which is considerably important right now where we have seen further put writing and of course on the higher end.
NEUT19|It's it's a toss up between 11,000 eleven 1500, but at this point in time I reckon 11,500 is more where there is a little more core writing activity considering they just bought 2% away from moving 211 thousand, it's not too far away.
NEUT20|An absolute possibility right now, not much resistance there either.
NEUT21|So well, taking over 11,000 may not be as hard according to a lot of analysts out there, so we'll be watching out for some of these accused as we move to trade next week.
BEAR22|Do remember the nifty put card ratio had fallen yesterday and I reckon it will once again arise today, so we'll be keeping in that.
NEUT23|In that in mind as well.
NEUT24|But on that note, it's a wrap of the markets, but there's lots more lined up.
NEUT25|Stay tuned.
NEUT26|"Blue movement."""
