NEUT0|"""Switching focus 12 minutes left was your last chance trade, so this ones actionable if you want it right, please OK, but the point I want to get the banks."
NEUT1|The big banks specifically, there's been nothing to say about these companies technically for a long time now.
BEAR2|We have two confirmed breakouts.
NEUT3|First one JP Morgan.
NEUT4|I'm long the stock.
NEUT5|I own it.
BULL6|I think she can roll up to 125 without any resistance here.
NEUT7|This is a bona fide breakout.
NEUT8|It's already happened, but the one that looks even better and I wish I owned it is US Bancorp.
NEUT9|No one ever talks about it.
NEUT10|They're not based in New York.
NEUT11|They're not controversial enough.
NEUT12|They don't have a silly mascot, but this one looks incredible.
BEAR13|This is the one has already broken out as we tested and survived, and I think this is just going to be a runaway train in comparison with the rest of the sector.
NEUT14|Here's one that's in development.
NEUT15|Keep an eye on STI, SunTrust.
NEUT16|This is not a money center, it's a regional, much tougher sector.
BEAR17|SunTrust has been consolidating around 6465 since February.
NEUT18|Now it is broken out.
BEAR19|I think 66 and a half the juice is loose.
NEUT20|This is where this thing really gets going.
NEUT21|Use a stop trailer with the 50 day Ma.
NEUT22|Take very little risk here to the downside, if you're wrong you will know immediately, but at this one gets going.
BULL23|It might even be a signal for the rest of the regionals.
NEUT24|Again, very tough trade there, but this ones working JP's the only one you own that I own.
NEUT25|JP Morgan.
NEUT26|I own Schwab doesn't look great.
NEUT27|I might buy Goldman Sachs.
NEUT28|Doesn't look great, but it could but but JPM is the one that I'm long.
NEUT29|OK, a triple.
BULL30|"Final trade Josh thanks."""
