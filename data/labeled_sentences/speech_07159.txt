BULL0|"""On balance, I think the risks are certainly skewed in that direction."
BEAR1|So yes, I do think they'll get worse from here.
BEAR2|If you look at emerging market shares in local currency terms, they've fallen about 15, maybe 16% moves around a little bit, but that's nothing compared to the full that they had through 2015.
BEAR3|Sixteen when they came down 27%, and in crises in the past.
BEAR4|If you go back to 9798 they had fallen something like 40%, so the falls we've seen so far have been quite significant, and they do owe a lot to contagion.
BEAR5|But I could get a lot worse before they get better, and the reason I think they could still get worse here is that the Fed is still raising interest rates.
BEAR6|That's putting up with pressure on the value of the US dollar, which makes life tougher for emerging countries.
BEAR7|We've got the trade war threat, which would certainly weigh on the emerging world, and uncertainty about how much China is going to slow down.
BEAR8|So all those things are negatives for the emerging world.
NEUT9|You got a five year view?
BULL10|Yeah, sure, by emerging market shares here, you'll do pretty well because the peas are quite low.
NEUT11|But if you're worried about the next six months, then I think it's too early.
NEUT12|And showing many have pointed to the midterm elections is a big risk factor that investors want to clear from your point of view is the right strategy to kind of hold steady and wait out that event.
NEUT13|Or you already reducing risk?
NEUT14|Would you recommend?
BULL15|We have reduced risk quite substantially.
BEAR16|We have minimal exposure to the emerging worlds I it's a, it's a difficult one because we already have seen these sharp falls.
NEUT17|So to sell further from here.
NEUT18|You know you you may get it right.
NEUT19|You may not.
NEUT20|On balance, I'd probably still take a little bit of risk off the table if you haven't already.
NEUT21|And I do agree that there are a few a few events coming up which could further weigh on the emerging well.
NEUT22|You've got the trade announcement from the US, an extra 200.
BEAR23|You've obviously got all the issues around Donald Trump, but you've got ongoing tightening from the Fed.
NEUT24|Probably the next one later this month looks like they'll do another one in December, and probably in March next year.
NEUT25|And then of course, you've got the midterm elections, which.
BEAR26|Another event which could add to uncertainty and weigh on merging markets as well.
NEUT27|So young balance I'd probably haven't taken off.
NEUT28|I'd still take a little bit off and less you can sort of take a longer term view in your investments.
NEUT29|Shane, I want to ask you about Turkey specifically.
NEUT30|I'll be in Istanbul tomorrow for that potential rate decision and the question of course going forward is going to be, you know how much independence as its central bank have.
NEUT31|How worried should we be?
NEUT32|What's your tag?
BEAR33|We should be worried about those things and the uncertainty on that front has been a contributor to the current crisis.
NEUT34|You know, global investors don't like it when governments intervene.
NEUT35|Talk about new ways of doing monetary policy.
BEAR36|All that stuff has been seen in the past, and it usually ends up badly and Venezuela is an extreme example of that.
NEUT37|So yes, I think it should be a case of hands off the Turkish central bank.
NEUT38|There should be allowed to do what?
NEUT39|Trying to economists would tell them to do and that in this environment is to raise interest rates to the point that it supports the currency.
NEUT40|Then of course, there will be a chance to cut them after that, but I think at this point in time the critical thing is to stabilize things.
NEUT41|Having government intervention in the central bank is not the way to go.
BEAR42|That just adds to the instability and uncertainty.
