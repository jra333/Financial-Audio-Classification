NEUT0|"""Hello again everyone, expense form from trumans.com and this is update for July 21st 2016."
NEUT1|Let's take a quick look at today's markets.
BULL2|Well that win streak for the Dow is officially over and you can see we've put in some bearish action here.
BULL3|Looks like we're about to pull back.
NEUT4|We should be able to close this gap in the next day or two and then it's a matter of how far this retracement will go.
BULL5|This previous high here on June 8th.
NEUT6|Probably a very likely level.
BEAR7|There's also that upsloping 20.
BEAR8|Moving average that will act as some support, so we can expect that in the days ahead, the S&P 500 was down eight points today and the NASDAQ was down 16.
BEAR9|The Russell also lower where it gets interesting is gold, you know, gold has been pulling back here for many days now, so you know has lost steam here.
NEUT10|Well, as you can see by that 20.
NEUT11|Moving average, it certainly has not.
BULL12|There are still significant momentum in place.
BULL13|We saw a nice upswing today in gold.
BULL14|It was up 12 points so we could see a retest of these highs in the near future as well and oil here facing a very key test coming up.
NEUT15|If we look across here if we look to our left.
BULL16|Uncrewed, there is an area right in here with significant support right here.
BULL17|Right in that 4420 or so 4430 area you can see here lots of support, but we have very strong momentum.
NEUT18|Lower here now.
BULL19|And so we've gotten to this level before recently here and balance.
NEUT20|But that bounce wasn't very high.
BULL21|In other words, you know we quickly lost steam and starts running over again, which makes me believe we're going to breakthrough this time around.
NEUT22|And if we do so.
NEUT23|Then we're talking about a much bigger drop, so that's what we want to look for in the days ahead, and also take another quick look at those weekly charts over the weekend.
NEUT24|But that's about it for now.
NEUT25|"Enjoy the rest of your day and we will see on our next update."""
