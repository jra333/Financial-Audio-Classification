BEAR0|"""You know Pitney Bowes is the Postal postage meter company and you might think because of that that it's days have passed."
BULL1|But could this stock jump 60% over the next three years?
NEUT2|Baron senior editor Jack House says yes it could happen and he joins us right now.
NEUT3|Jack bringing out all the **** on this one.
BEAR4|Thanks for pounding the table for maybe I'm not doing a pretty good job of it yourself.
NEUT5|This stock is actually since the new CEO took over in December 2012.
NEUT6|The stock is.
BULL7|Outperformed Facebook it's more than doubled.
NEUT8|A lot of surprises when you sort of dig deep into this company.
NEUT9|We know about their legacy Mail machine business.
NEUT10|First of all, that's more flat than falling right now.
BEAR11|It's a business that has some long term leases that had to run off after the financial crisis, but now that they have it's flattened out and the margins that business are almost pornographic.
NEUT12|Pollitz Mail machines in that business they have ILS.
BULL13|They have better profit margins than Apple has in that business.
NEUT14|Now this is, I imagine this is all stuff being sold to businesses, right?
NEUT15|That's why the Mail business isn't falling off, right?
NEUT16|They have it divided between small mid sized businesses and large businesses last quarter.
BEAR17|Smaller mid was down 1%.
BULL18|The big businesses that were up 1% so it kind of offsets each other.
NEUT19|But you get huge profit margins and huge cash flow.
NEUT20|Now what they've done is they are investing that cash flow into some growth.
NEUT21|Your areas they handle things like global shipping, shipping if you want.
NEUT22|If you want to autograph that necktie and put it up for sale on eBay and someone in Singapore buys it.
NEUT23|Well, it's pretty easy for you to ship it over there because Pitney Bowes handles the stuff behind the scenes about all the customs work and other taxes and this sort of thing.
BULL24|That's one thing, they also have a fairly sophisticated location service that they sell to social media companies or finding people finding nearby e-commerce businesses so they've identified some of these businesses that are investing in them and the revenue growth there is significant 23% revenue growth in that portion of the business last quarter.
NEUT25|So that's going to make a bigger portion of the pie.
NEUT26|This is a company where.
NEUT27|You've already seen this stock play valuation, ketchup.
BULL28|It's come from a PE in single digits up to around 14 times earnings versus closer to 16 for the SNP.
NEUT29|I don't think that PE ratio is going much higher, but earnings were $1.88 last year.
BULL30|I think this company can earn around 3 bucks a share three years from now, so much faster earnings growth in the market.
NEUT31|So so legacy business that is that is flat.
NEUT32|But bringing in cash, right?
NEUT33|Digital business is a lot of competition there.
NEUT34|I gotta think why 60%?
NEUT35|I mean, that's a big number to move.
BULL36|Well, the stock's performance from here, I think, will match the earnings growth.
BULL37|And there's a lot of rooms for room for earnings growth.
BULL38|There's also some financial improvement going on behind the scenes.
BULL39|The new CEO is unlocked a lot of cash flow.
NEUT40|They've used that to pay down debt.
NEUT41|They've they've.
BULL42|They've got faster inventory turnover, so there's a lot to like right now.
NEUT43|And this is a company that can fund its own growth.
BULL44|From here, they've identified some good areas to put that money into, so I like the stable cash flow.
NEUT45|I like the.
NEUT46|So new opportunities for growth and it's a stock that's still out of discount to the market and you get a good dividend.
NEUT47|The dividend is just under 3% right now.
BULL48|That is good alright Jack?
BULL49|How thanks for coming in.
NEUT50|Appreciate it.
