NEUT0|"""For watching this quick video on and General Electric, as usual, this video is just to guide to let you get more confident with the technical analysis and I would recommend to have a look at fundamental news and always match fundamental and technical analysis."
NEUT1|General Electric is be moving in sideways just after the coronavirus came in since the beginning of May.
NEUT2|As we can see right there and is just.
BULL3|Started performing when going up since yeah or set them, but with the good news of the vaccine and they were coming.
NEUT4|Actually we got.
NEUT5|Now we got even more than one vaccine.
BULL6|We got 3/3 vaccines.
BULL7|Seems all of them working so so this is good news of course.
BULL8|Plus the good news for General Electric SA.
NEUT9|Lot of businesses in Asia with the new the new President Biden.
BULL10|So all those good news for General Electric just made this company performing very well at this.
NEUT11|Those are the results.
NEUT12|Spear right now.
NEUT13|It's a little bit too late to get into it and to go along because we were supposed to go long at the end of September.
NEUT14|All we can do now we can still get something from it with the new target price of 13 U.S. dollar.
NEUT15|But what we have to do now is just all them wait.
NEUT16|If this target price is actually disperse target price that is going to work as resistance.
NEUT17|And now.
NEUT18|This residence will be broken.
NEUT19|The idea is to go long, otherwise hold wait for a possible price retracement that can use 10 U.S. dollars.
NEUT20|Nine installer or either or even eight U.S. dollars in support for in you rarely.
NEUT21|So just wait this possible price attachment before going wrong or just wait this tag price that is is is working now as resistance is gonna be broken before going along.
NEUT22|So in other words let's wait the next two days next week.
NEUT23|If the prices would be closing above this 11.3 U.S. dollar Terrier is to go long or otherwise just hold before going along.
NEUT24|If you it's too risky to go short, but there might be an opportunity for a short time to go short because again, if this target price will not be broken, the prices might start going down a little bit before going up again.
NEUT25|And if you want to go short, remember that 10 years dollar, nine years dollar, an 8 year stoler all of them came work as support for and you rarely so.
NEUT26|I don't know if it's really worth to go a short right now, but I will just hold before going long just to wait the right time to go long for General Electric.
NEUT27|So in conclusion, just hold for now waiting.
NEUT28|This darker path will be broken or just wait at the end of this place replacement before Queen clogged.
NEUT29|"Thanks bye."""
