BULL0|"""Churchill is a position that I actually want to get into, so I'm glad that this is dropping down."
NEUT1|I want to see this get down to $20.00 if it can get down to $20.
BULL2|I see this as a great buying opportunity to push up to $30 easily.
BULL3|It did have a pretty good day yesterday where it did increase quite a bit up to $24.00 or $25 here so you can get some pretty good movement there.
NEUT4|I just want to see this go a little bit lower somewhere around that $20 mark and then we could possibly see some some great movement there, but that's my opinion of Civ.
BULL5|Churchill Capital is going to be really good.
NEUT6|I don't think it's going back to where it was.
BULL7|"I'm just looking for that small short term gain which will amount to a lot when it comes to how many shares I'm buying."""
