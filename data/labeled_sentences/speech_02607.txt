NEUT0|"""We need to solve the underlying problem, which is a health care problem, a public health problem we need to solve for this for this virus, either via some kind of treatment that makes it tolerable, or we're in the long run some kind of vaccine that we cannot inoculate a large part of the population from this virus."
NEUT1|So the solution?
NEUT2|Is a health care solution is not a solution out of you know economics out of the Fed or out of Congress?
NEUT3|And that's why we've seen with the Fed.
BULL4|Even if they've gone bigger and bigger and bigger in terms of their interventions, you haven't really seen the market respond very positively in the near term to that.
NEUT5|But the Fed is trying to do is they're just trying to preserve the system for the other side of the health care crisis that we have a functioning system.
NEUT6|the Fed right now cannot fix this.
NEUT7|The Congress cannot fix it by economic stimulus.
NEUT8|The Congress maybe can fix it by addressing the health care crisis.
NEUT9|So what we would say to consumers is it's a good time to, you know, check your whole financial profile.
NEUT10|Try and figure out where there's opportunities for you to save money.
BEAR11|Alot of interest rates are getting lower.
BEAR12|We saw them go low for mortgages.
NEUT13|They've popped up a little bit, but they still have some savings there for a lot of consumers you can save on a credit card or an auto loan.
NEUT14|All these things.
NEUT15|the Fed facilities are making all these things cheaper.
BULL16|"So you should see if you can get a lower interest rate and that will help you endure this crisis."""
