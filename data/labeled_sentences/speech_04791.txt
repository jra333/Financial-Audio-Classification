BEAR10|It was being sold off at the start of the week, but that was because of the dollar strengthened.

BEAR14|The state Agent Shell's shares fell because of the ban on letting fees, while those likely to benefit from infrastructure infrastructure spending on transport and construction did well.
BEAR15|Overall, a market response that was a bit disappointing, but at least investors have a bit more reality about the.
NEUT16|"Economic impact of Brexit."""
