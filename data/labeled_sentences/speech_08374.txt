NEUT0|"""As a Reporter covering the Federal Reserve, I gotta question all the time about inflation."
NEUT1|Even for my own father.
NEUT2|Why does the Fed ignore food and energy prices?
NEUT3|Well, let's take a look at that.
NEUT4|the Fed is in charge of managing the nations money supply.
NEUT5|It pumps dollars into and out of the economy.
NEUT6|As consumers, we want to know that the value of our money is holding up the Fed pumps too many dollars in that dollar.
NEUT7|In your wallet won't go as far.
NEUT8|Because prices will start rising for everything.
NEUT9|Think about all the goods and services that you buy over the course of a year, hamburgers.
NEUT10|Gasoline clothes haircuts.
NEUT11|It's a very long list and it goes on the government tracks all these prices and comes up with an index to see how they move every month.
NEUT12|It's weighted by how much of your budget goes to these items.
NEUT13|Garbage collection in most family budgets gets .271%.
NEUT14|Doctors visits 5.8%.
NEUT15|Keeping that roof over your head gets more than 30% of your annual budget, and food and energy make up 24% of the average family budget.
NEUT16|That's a pretty substantial amount, yet sometimes you hear economists talk about inflation, excluding food and energy.
NEUT17|Now, that seems strange, doesn't it?
NEUT18|Everyone has to eat.
NEUT19|We all have to go places.
NEUT20|Why would economists ignore it?
BEAR21|It's because food and energy prices are volatile.
BEAR22|They get pushed around more than many other items by droughts.
BEAR23|Or political mayhem thousands of miles away.
NEUT24|Economists think they get a better sense of where inflation is heading in the long run.
NEUT25|By looking past short run ups and downs, does the Fed ignore food and energy?
NEUT26|It does look at these trends.
BULL27|Actually, though, its official target is steady, 2% increases in consumer prices across all items, including food and energy.
NEUT28|This idea that it ignores food and energy actually isn't right.
NEUT29|So Dad and everyone else.
NEUT30|"That's your inflation, 101."""
