NEUT0|"""Just this morning was part of the numbers in my model."
NEUT1|I took the afternoon off to watch the view, so I haven't had the opportunity to go through the numbers until late last night and this morning.
BULL2|And it's there's a lot of impressive changes going on at Facebook in terms of growth.
BULL3|You know, we see a lot of growth in users and we kind of may be expected.
NEUT4|That would continue, but tail off as a company got more mature, but we've seen some important changes in the way that they do business.
NEUT5|One that jumps out of me right here is, you know, when the company public two years ago we looked at the nascent payments business and thought.
NEUT6|Jesus, they can grow that beyond Zynga.
NEUT7|This could be an empower important business far above the 15% of sales or so it is that this is actually fallen.
BULL8|This company is much more advertising dependent and the shift to mobile has been fantastic for them as opposed to the threat that it appeared to be when they went public two years ago.
NEUT9|So does it blow your mind?
NEUT10|Do you remember when they went public?
NEUT11|One of the biggest albatrosses they had was how are they going to get their head around mobile?
NEUT12|And now they're the guys dominating in it?
NEUT13|Yeah, I think you know I was going to use the word gaming.
BULL14|I don't think they quite gained the IPO, but I think that they were very forthright.
NEUT15|Maybe overly so in terms of warning that they had nothing going on mobile.
NEUT16|In fact they were working diligently on it.
NEUT17|We later learned that Mark Zuckerberg actually wrote his letter to shareholders in the IPO filing on a mobile device that seemed like a ridiculous thing when he said it at the time, but clearly that showed how much their focus was on mobile.
NEUT18|So you got your point.
BULL19|Now in the last quarter, mobile revenues up 24% year sequentially.
NEUT20|And that's a core where you would expect that kind of thing to be down mobiles.
BULL21|Now a majority of their advertising revenue, which it wasn't even a year ago as it's been growing and the revenue per mobile ad has been increasing a lot.
BULL22|Corey, I was looking at some research this morning showing that Facebook's EBIT da margins, yeah roughly 81% or some of the highest any company of this size has ever reported.
BEAR23|Google apparently may have reported the highest EBIT da margins of all back in 2009, but it was a one off.
NEUT24|And this research showed that when Google was Facebook size, which is to say a run rate of some $12 billion a year in revenue, its EBIT on margins were like half.
NEUT25|How is that to suggest that Facebook's ramping higher?
BEAR26|Or is it like Google ultimately going to have to live in a world of lower margins?
NEUT27|So look at little chart showing right now this is just from my own model, but this is the number of reported.
BULL28|As I mentioned evedon margins.
NEUT29|By the way, we're looking at the operating margins which are slightly different but nevertheless slightly different Android now.
NEUT30|The reason I think the margin, the number of here is important, because this takes out the stock compensation expense and non cash expense.
BEAR31|That gets particularly weird around an IPO and starts to level out over time.
BULL32|You can see a really clear freaking trend there and it's amazing they did some things right around the IPO where they took some really big R&D charges.
NEUT33|They spent vast fortunes in research and development, in particular an IT obscured.
NEUT34|What might be happening or what they could do, and it made you wonder what they would do in the future, what they told us in the conference call last night and what those numbers show us.
NEUT35|Is it the company is getting more and more profitable that they well?
BULL36|Well it's still growing well.
BULL37|They're still hiring well, they're still building a new campus and everything else and doing of course lots of acquisitions.
NEUT38|There's sort of a cap on the amount of expenditures.
BULL39|In fact, they said going forward, but their margins are going to look a little bit better than they've been in the past.
BULL40|So a really powerful profit story here.
NEUT41|Just straight from the income statement, again taking up the stock compensation charges, which I think is the appropriate thing to do here.
NEUT42|And it's not always the case, but I think in this case it is appropriate.
NEUT43|To show how strong this business is, how profitable this business is throwing the growth and then figuring out how to charge adds to put up fewer ads, charge more for those ads, put him in the newsfeed, take him off the side of the page.
BULL44|"It's a really powerful story."""
