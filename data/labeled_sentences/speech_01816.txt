NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today."
NEUT1|I'm going to be taking a look at the cryptocurrency cake which is pancake swap against tether US based off of Binance prices and I'm just going to kind of give some of my thoughts on this one.
NEUT2|So as you can see you know we've been talking about this one like four or five times already and normally I don't do update videos as quickly as I did on this one.
NEUT3|I think I talked about it yesterday or the day before but ultimately now what I'm going to be looking for is after we got this bounce off of this support level around like $15 broke back above that like 1630 level which was the other support level that I had wanted to see hold.
BULL4|It acted as a little bit of resistance here on lower timeframes, but it started to break above.
BULL5|We're starting to see increasing volume and it's starting to push back up towards that $19.00 mark.
NEUT6|So at this point, you know I want to see a little bit more volume.
BULL7|This daily candle didn't quite close above 18, So what I would like to see moving forward is again more volume to come in.
NEUT8|I would like to see this one start to pop out above this like 1920 level, and then I think if it's one crack 20 ish on volume then this one is going to be set up for a really really nice run in the coming days.
NEUT9|As far as risk levels to watch.
BEAR10|At this point I want to see today's low of day or like even a little bit lower down to like 17 ish dollars hold.
NEUT11|The next level of support below that is 1620 ish and then below that you know this one could retest like 1470 fourteen 80 mark.
BULL12|But as far as risk to reward goes on this point, you know this one is at a big move up some sideways action holding some supports and now it's starting to curl back up on increasing volume.
BULL13|This is a chart that's starting to look really really good and if we pull up the four hour chart you'll be able to potentially see it a little bit better, so this one is starting to look really, really nice again.
NEUT14|Risk depending where you want to look at it is right around that like $17.00 mark.
NEUT15|To even you could even use if you're going to keep a really tight stop on this one.
NEUT16|Potentially some of this resistance around like that 1780.
NEUT17|You'd want to see that hold us support now.
BULL18|But again, this one is starting to push up towards that.
NEUT19|You know, big spot to watch, so that's going to be what all eyes are on including mine.
NEUT20|As time starts moving forward.
NEUT21|So overall, right?
NEUT22|This is a pretty nice looking chart, but again with crypto anything can happen.
NEUT23|But this is one that I'm certainly leaning towards.
NEUT24|The bullish side on, though I would always have a plan to the downside.
