NEUT3|Not all of these in My Portfolio are there pics, but the ones that I'm going to show you are so Pinterest.
BULL4|I've had this for about 3 months and will switch the view so you can see it's been up 61%.
NEUT5|My return is 60% based on the date that I bought it, which was October 1st.
NEUT6|That's crazy.
NEUT7|It's less than three months of age 60%.
BEAR8|Another one of their picks is Slack.
BULL9|This one's up 39.24%.
BULL10|My investments up 50% for the day that I actually purchased it, so this is unbelievable.
BULL11|So I really have been impressed with their picks.
NEUT12|Some of these like Zynga I got in late so I don't have that great of a return 3.58%, but all of them are in the positive.
