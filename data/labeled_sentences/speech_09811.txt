NEUT0|"""OK, so I thought I'll do a quick update on my GameStop position."
NEUT1|Let's go so.
NEUT2|This is the position right here.
NEUT3|Right now it's worth 44,000.
NEUT4|$850 I bought it for 3000.
NEUT5|But for $3800, about 10 to 15 days ago.
BULL6|Today it went up $21,200 or about 89%, so total up 1000%.
NEUT7|Is my second position that it bought around the same time maybe a little bit before this one is worth $60,589.00 and I paid for?
BEAR8|I'm sorry and it is gained $48,175.
NEUT9|And finally, here's my cyber truck order.
NEUT10|"I have one of the first allocations."""
