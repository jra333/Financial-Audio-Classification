BEAR0|"""Given the unprecedented time of the economy and the debt level, could there be any risks and consequences of the US government defaulting on its bonds?"
NEUT1|No.
NEUT2|The.
NEUT3|If you.
NEUT4|If you print.
NEUT5|Bonds in your own currency.
NEUT6|What happens to the currency, is it?
NEUT7|Gonna be a question 'cause you don't default and.
NEUT8|The United States.
BULL9|Has been smart enough.
BULL10|Then the and people have trusted us enough.
NEUT11|Do.
NEUT12|Issue with that and are its own currency and.
BEAR13|Argentina is now having a problem because the debt isn't in there.
BEAR14|Their own currency and in lots of countries have had that problem and lots of competent countries will have that problem in the future.
NEUT15|It is very painful to owe money in somebody elses currency, but.
NEUT16|If you.
NEUT17|Listen, if I could issue a currency Buffett Bucks and I had a printing press.
NEUT18|I could borrow money and I could borrow money and that I would never default, so.
NEUT19|What you end up getting in terms of purchasing power can be in doubt, but in terms of the US government, I when Standard and Poor's downgraded, the United States government.
NEUT20|I think it was standard Poors.
NEUT21|Years back that.
NEUT22|To me did not make sense.
NEUT23|I'm in the end in the end.
NEUT24|How you can regard?
NEUT25|Any Corporation as stronger than the.
NEUT26|A person who can print the money to pay you just don't understand.
NEUT27|So don't worry about the government defaulting.
NEUT28|I think it's kind of crazy.
NEUT29|Incidentally, this should be said.
NEUT30|To have these.
NEUT31|Limits on the debt and all of that sort of thing and then stopped government arguing about whether it's going to increase the limit.
BULL32|We're going to increase the limits on the debt.
NEUT33|The debt isn't going to be paid.
NEUT34|It's going to be refunded.
NEUT35|And anybody that thinks they're going to bring down the national debt.
NEUT36|I mean that that you know there's been brief periods and.
BEAR37|I think in the late 90s or thereabouts that's come down a little bit.
BULL38|"The country is going to print more debt is going to initiate, the country is going to grow in terms of its its debt, paying capacity, and but the trick is to keep borrowing in your own currency."""
