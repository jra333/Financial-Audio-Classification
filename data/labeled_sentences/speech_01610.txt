BULL0|"""Hey guys, thank him for about us on the planet today."
NEUT1|We're talking about a new article that came out out of nasdaq.com and that is the Bitcoin miner.
NEUT2|Cypher mining is going public, and they're going to be merging with a SPAC by the name of Good Works Acquisition Corp. That's ticker symbol GWAC.
NEUT3|So what is mining?
NEUT4|Mining is basically the digital production of a cryptocurrency, so cypher mining in particular focuses only on mining Bitcoin.
NEUT5|Now, once this transaction goes through, the merger happens.
NEUT6|This new company will then.
NEUT7|Sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol CIFR, but right now if you want to get on this company, you're looking for GWAC.
NEUT8|Now cipher mining was originally a subsidiary of a company called Bit For Bit Fury Group.
NEUT9|Now Bitfury Group was founded back in 2011 and that company concentrated on mining hardware and they did other things like crypto related software and other services and then that that parent.
NEUT10|Company called Bit Bitfury group.
NEUT11|They have about mind over 600,000 Bitcoin to date, so let me give you some information.
NEUT12|Real quick.
NEUT13|Just in case you don't know, there are currently right now.
NEUT14|There's well not right now, but just in general only 21 million bitcoins can be mined in total out of the whole world.
NEUT15|Now, once that's done, the planet Supply is basically going to be tapped out, and as of this year in February, almost 19.
NEUT16|Of that, 21 million Bitcoin has already been mined, so there's only a little bit more than two million Bitcoin to be to be left to be mined, so you may be asking yourself why would I invest in cypher mining if almost all the bitcoins already mind?
BULL17|Well, the miners are still going to be incentivized to mine, and due to the payment of processing fees for transactions, so it may be a good company to look into.
NEUT18|If you believe in the future of Bitcoin then you know this is one that you won't want to take a look at anyways.
NEUT19|That's going to be for today.
NEUT20|Guys will be guys.
