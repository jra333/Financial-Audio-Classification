BULL0|"""Welcome back to fast money everybody shares of Roku on the rise, jumping 13% today."
BULL1|The streaming platform, rallying after a strong earnings beat, so Steve Grasso.
NEUT2|What you take on Roku.
BULL3|So they grew revenues by 73% or so.
BULL4|They grew their user base over 40%.
NEUT5|These TV's that they're built in Tyler, Pete and I are giving away these TV's to every new follower on Twitter.
NEUT6|So this is how easy you can get these hashtag.
NEUT7|Just kidding, but but still, they're growing their ad base here, but I will say this, this stock on a chart all you technicians understand this.
NEUT8|It checks back to its 50 day habitually and that is 20%.
NEUT9|Lower than the current stock price, so let's even say it has a rising 50 day moving average.
NEUT10|You're due for a 15% check back, so you want to buy it.
NEUT11|You wait and then you could buy it even cheaper and have a great deal longer term.
NEUT12|It is all about Pete when you buy, not necessarily a buy and sell, not necessarily what you buy, right?
NEUT13|That's absolutely right.
NEUT14|You know the problem is when you look at this name, you look at it and you say my goodness, where is this thing from a PC perspective?
NEUT15|And you could say that about a lot of companies Tyler, we've gone through this whole pandemic and we've talked about Zoom.
NEUT16|We've talked about all these various names.
NEUT17|Roku is just an extraordinary.
NEUT18|It is an unbelievable quarter that they put up, but I like Steve's idea of at least waiting for a pullback and giving you at least an idea, a road map of when, when it might be a better opportunity to buy.
NEUT19|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT20|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
