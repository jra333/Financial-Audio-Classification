NEUT0|"""Somebody keeps asking about tell us what's tell us."
NEUT1|Let me look at Telus OK, go ahead buddy.
NEUT2|Telecom services in British Columbia tell us is one of the Big three wireless service providers in Canada with its 9,000,000 mobile phone subscribers nationwide, constituting almost 30% of the total market.
NEUT3|OK so big dividend yeah, let's look at $25 billion company 25 PE.
BULL4|So X there 7.75% profit margin expected so not great in either one but that's OK but almost a 5% dividend yield which means 1.25 billion being spent on dividends every year.
BULL5|Nice dividend though.
BULL6|Nice dividend revenue growth retailer #3 check Mark 9.7 billion to 11 billion.
BULL7|Nice profit growth.
BULL8|1 billion to 1.3 and very consistently growing.
BEAR9|So check mark their number of shares outstanding is Pillar #5 poem marginally lower 1.206 to 1.204, but it went a lot lower than started to increase, so I don't know what they're doing right now.
NEUT10|Let's see how they're doing in the last quarter.
BULL11|Yeah, they are increasing the number of shares outstanding.
BULL12|They are definitely issuing more shares as the quarters go on.
NEUT13|So I don't like that a lot.
NEUT14|But it's still technically a check mark, even though it's not really that good.
NEUT15|Pill number 6 is current assets over current liabilities, Paul.
BEAR16|Current assets 3.265 billion current liabilities 4.1 that's an accident.
NEUT17|The first one today we've seen with less current assets and current liabilities.
NEUT18|Yeah, that doesn't happen often.
NEUT19|It doesn't happen often and free.
NEUT20|Cash flow.
NEUT21|My favorite one in the world.
BULL22|Free cash flow growth is pill number 7.
BEAR23|Oh boy, it is positive it is a check mark but they have like no free cash flow in last five years so it's a check mark for the free cash flow growth 'cause they went from losing 100,000,000 to basically breaking even.
NEUT24|But in terms of the average on last five years, it is definitely they spent a lot of money on capital expenditures.
NEUT25|Guys a lot of money so you need to figure out how much these capital expenditures.
NEUT26|Our growth, capital expenditures versus maintenance, sometimes in their annual reports.
NEUT27|They will mention that because maintenance ones or the capital expenditures they need in order to continue operating their business, as is the growth capital expenditures the Catholic senators they spend to grow the business, which is a lot different.
NEUT28|As an example, in our in our properties, when we replace the roof, that's maintenance capital expenditures.
NEUT29|When we remodel a unit to get a higher rent, that is growth, capital expenditures.
NEUT30|So the same thing with companies.
NEUT31|I don't.
BEAR32|Yeah, this is this is a tough one.
NEUT33|I'm going to avoid this one unless I understand I need to understand more about how much of their capital expenditures or maintenance versus growth 'cause but The thing is, they're not even growing that much in terms of revenue.
NEUT34|So yeah, this is a no on tell us at the moment, right?
NEUT35|Palm?
NEUT36|Is there no one?
NEUT37|"Tell us for sure."""
