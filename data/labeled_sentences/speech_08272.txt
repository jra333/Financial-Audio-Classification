BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on to sparrows?"
NEUT1|Welcome to another brand new video.
NEUT2|I just have a quick update for all of you, so I have $22,000 in Facebook stock and today is the day the day of their earnings, and this is going to take place after hours today, October 29th.
NEUT3|So we're going to see what happens, but I definitely would like this talk to reach $300.00 and then I'm out.
BEAR4|So this is a decision upheld for probably longer.
NEUT5|Three to four months, so I've gotten my average class below, but we're going to see what comes out after this earnings.
BEAR6|Microsoft had good earnings, but yet there's still there.
BEAR7|Stockstill went down after so this kind of makes me a little bit worried.
BEAR8|Right now I have a game at $3000.00, so the reason why the Microsoft situation scares me is because even though they did well because of the economy and what's going on, their stock was severely impacted.
BEAR9|Think it was down 5% on pay.
NEUT10|So yeah, I have about $22,000 in the stock at 15% total return right now, so we're going to see what happens as soon as they report earnings.
NEUT11|I'm definitely going to watch the whole thing after hours.
NEUT12|So yeah, we'll see what happens right now.
NEUT13|It's around 279 per share.
NEUT14|And it has reached 300 in the past that did not even have anything to do with their earnings.
BULL15|This is post earnings, so there's really no telling what can happen, but I think reaching past $300 is definitely doable, and that should lead to closing decision with about $5000 in profits.
NEUT16|I have 82 shares right now, and the actual rating for Facebook stock.
BEAR17|The fair value is 285, so it's actually under.
BEAR18|Value right now, and I think this is just because of the economy and what's going on an actually Google and Facebook and a lot of social media companies like Twitter or being investigated heavily by the government.
NEUT19|They want to limit what type of posts can be posted and whatever groups can be on these platforms and it's all a question of freedom of speech.
NEUT20|So yeah, we'll see what happens.
