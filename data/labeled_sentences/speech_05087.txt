BULL7|Is that stock also surges up to yes all time highs and gets up too high of four spot 450 up about 13% in the week.
BEAR8|White knowledge when pulling back analyst now down grading this stock the valuations are just absolutely nutty in this stock.
NEUT9|When we look at it the PE right now is 70 plus.
NEUT10|This is not a growth company anymore as far as I'm concerned.
BULL11|These estimates have been upgraded as you can see, but still trading at that high PE.
NEUT12|Moving up through this FIB extension zone you see these blue arrows here.
BEAR13|While our members know that that's saying there's another extension zone up over here.
NEUT14|Question is, is that the high at 4:50 or is it going to try for 500 before it rolls over?
NEUT15|I'm guessing this is the high right over here, but I want to put that in there.
BEAR16|In case crazy went to super crazy and we're going to project this stock to having topped and that I'm going to say the stock pulls down to about this 370 level.
BEAR17|Yes, in July is what we're looking at, so maybe probably another 40% downside in here, but it's not going to give up that easily.
NEUT18|"It probably tries for that upside again before it's over with."""
