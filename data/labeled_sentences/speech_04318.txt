NEUT5|But now we come to the stock of the week.
NEUT6|Today I have chosen Allstate Corporation, an American insurance company based in Illinois.
BULL7|Allstate has performed very well over the last five years.
BULL8|The return on shares has increased by about 200% and the margin by about 130%.
BULL9|Allstate's revenues are up almost 20% and its operating cash flow is up about 37%.
BEAR10|Right now the stock is significantly undervalued, as we see here.
BULL11|The 15 analysts who have issued 12 month forecasts see an average gain of about 30%.
NEUT12|Plus Allstate offers an annual dividend currently 2.82%.
NEUT13|So I am buying the stock now and holding it until fair value is regained at the blue line.
