NEUT0|"""Here we are."
NEUT1|It's live.
BULL2|It's a 580 call we got bids out.
NEUT3|The SMF market makers in the pit there down here at two and a half dollars.
BEAR4|Notice that there's a high print $10 but the really the closed the previous day was 4.70.
NEUT5|So when we take a look at how we're going to get made in that market as a professional market makers that we are at price action.
NEUT6|At just like if you were buying down in the pit, it's all about getting out wholesale bid.
NEUT7|And we have that limit order out there right now at 2.50 ratio entry.
NEUT8|That puts us at a wholesale entry.
NEUT9|Then the SMF myties watching the reversal 3 minute chart.
NEUT10|Look at that reversal on the three minute chart.
NEUT11|This is a Google chart.
NEUT12|Now empties.
BEAR13|Look at how they're dropping the bids down at the wholesale bid AMI empty.
NEUT14|There's trying to make a market at $3 now.
NEUT15|We bounce over here off that bottom.
NEUT16|And when we do reverse, that's when we're going to put the bottom in over here.
NEUT17|Then we have to have a buy action bar on the way up you get in, and then you're able to sell the supply as being the executor, meaning that you can control this side of the ASK market with that side of the wholesale entry, because it puts you on this side.
NEUT18|You could go 3:40 to sell and see if someone hits you, and that's what making a mark it's about.
NEUT19|That's what.
NEUT20|Being an SMF.
NEUT21|MMT.
NEUT22|Market maker is and they can do it right from their home.
NEUT23|They can do it from anywhere in the world and they can do it here now and once again that's all about understanding the intraday reversal so that when this fell in price this also went down to this lower end of this price and they finally have stopped there.
NEUT24|So basically we're going to see based on the intraday reversal trend is how we hold the market right in here 'cause it's still relatively wholesale.
NEUT25|To this wholesale bid, and people will step in like they stepped in at 3:50 as someone fills it than 330 comes into play.
NEUT26|So it's all going to be now based on this price action stability, which is going to hold this market over here MMT once again as 325, 2011 580 call.
NEUT27|This is the best that it gets.
NEUT28|It doesn't get better than his folks because.
NEUT29|Why we show it as we're doing it live?
NEUT30|This is not after the fact.
NEUT31|This is a gift.
NEUT32|And making markets in the option pit with options and understanding how to apply this chart to this price is what makes the MMT an MMT.
NEUT33|"Our bids remain at 2.50 ratio will update later."""
