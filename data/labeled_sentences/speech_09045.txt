BEAR0|"""Yeah I wanted to ask you too about real estate, obviously, since such an area of expertise for you, and obviously we've seen home prices continue to rise on that front as mortgage rates continue to drop."
BULL1|And and we've seen continued strength at the top end of the market as well.
NEUT2|So what's your?
NEUT3|What's your take there as how the election could impact those trends that we've seen play out here?
BEAR4|Because we've seen mortgage applications to purchase home actually came in about flat after falling for four straight weeks.
NEUT5|So what's your take on the strength of the housing market now and how the election could change?
NEUT6|I don't think the election is going to have much to do with the housing market.
NEUT7|It's like a horse that's running the bar of the barn at about 100 miles an hour and there's no stopping it.
BEAR8|Of course, it's uneven market, the suburban areas, the wealthier vacation areas, the country areas are all skyrocketing with the shortage of listing them prices going up far beyond what's reported because you have to realize when price increases are reported by any organization.
NEUT9|It's based on Closings, not on deals that were just made which arose May 3 months in advance.
NEUT10|So I think the housing market.
BULL11|Is exploding well beyond what's being reported, and I think that's going to come out in the next couple of months, but so far as how the election will affect it, it's amazing.
NEUT12|It's almost like the strength is beyond the election that nobody's paying attention.
NEUT13|But when I say strength, of course it's a slanted strength, because that's not true of the coastal cities, and it's certainly not true of New York City, which is taking it in in the gut.
NEUT14|Of course, almost every sector of the market, except for the cheap rentals and a very inexpensive purchases.
BULL15|They're still alive and well.
BEAR16|But 90% of New York City is in the worst shape I have seen it in many, many years, but the only pipe I'm trying to think of what to say.
BULL17|That's optimistic.
NEUT18|Here he is.
NEUT19|The optimistic part.
NEUT20|If you're a rich guy, you're really dying by New York City.
NEUT21|Now is the time you could go in and clip anything for 3035% off.
NEUT22|So you get that mansion in the Sky that you've always dreamed about.
BULL23|And I truly believe that in three years time, those values will be recouped and you'll have all that money back.
NEUT24|But other than that, it's not a pretty picture in the big city markets at all.
NEUT25|Yeah, for the bulk of the houses.
NEUT26|I mean when we talk about people who might not be focusing on the luxury, a portion of this.
BEAR27|There are a lot of fears though that that boom might have happened.
NEUT28|We talk about the shift to the suburbs for middle class homes or that kind of piece of the market here.
NEUT29|Might have already happened.
BEAR30|If you look at mortgage applications falling for four straight weeks and now being flat, there are people looking at that key piece of this and saying, look, maybe that trends over we've hit peak House here and could be the start of a downturn.
NEUT31|So what do you say about that?
NEUT32|Come on Zach, you smarter than that?
NEUT33|Why even repeating that kind of stuff listen?
BEAR34|Mortgage applications applications have leveled off because we went through such a huge catch up, but with this cheap money around, nobody ceasing buying one of the main reasons why mortgage applications applications are down is because people can't get their hands on the houses for every 2 bars is one house to be had, so there's an extreme slanted market with the shortest rheumatory, and that explains those numbers.
NEUT35|No, not at all.
NEUT36|The housing market is so hot I almost feel like I should apologize for it's not even my market you OK?
BEAR37|But the housing market is so strong right now we're not going to make up for this last time for a lot of months to be coming up, and prices are going to price out all the starter homes.
NEUT38|Of course, as time goes on, but every other market is going to be going like hot cakes, and you can count on it for the next three to six months easilly.
BEAR39|This too much pent up demand.
NEUT40|This two shorter supply.
BULL41|"And it's going to take awhile to even that square out."""
