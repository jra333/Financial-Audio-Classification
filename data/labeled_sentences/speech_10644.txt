NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take like the Apple stock we can see here today."
NEUT1|Apple has formed a green handle.
NEUT2|This green candle just stopped at the year.
NEUT3|My life, so it's still something we need to be cautious because if we are stopped below this line, that means will continue the downtrend and retest the 200 days year may line.
BULL4|So today's signal tells us even though we gotta reverse sentiment for short term.
BEAR5|But in mid term there still bearish because we're still below this year.
NEUT6|My life.
BULL7|"Thank you."""
