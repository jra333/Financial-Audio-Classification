NEUT0|"""Can you walk me through the breath and the participation of this rally?"
BULL1|This record, high compared to the record high we printed say several months ago how much healthier this one is?
BULL2|Thank you so much for having us.
BULL3|Yeah, I think this is all about the transition to better breath, better performance on a fundamental basis, and really a fundamentally LED stock pickers market.
NEUT4|I think we're most people have it wrong for 2021.
NEUT5|Is this automatic transition back to normalcy?
NEUT6|I just don't think it's going to be that easy of 2020 taught us anything.
BULL7|We're still going to have fits and starts momentum, rhetoric driven market.
NEUT8|Look at the month of November alone in terms of this binary decision to buy cyclicals and value stocks.
NEUT9|Again, this was clear.
NEUT10|Really just trying to add under exposure to those areas that have been underperforming with respect to your question with in terms of leadership, you know clearly the stay at home stocks and specifically the communication services and technology sector at being 40% of the market clearly skewed.
BULL11|The performance early on, but I think we as investors and we as society have learned now how to deal from the chaos of COVID-19 coronavirus and what it did to our professional and personal lives into now coexisting with the virus.
NEUT12|And now having the hope in the faith of having vaccines be omnipresent.
NEUT13|But I think the reality of it Jonathan is that is that the first half of the year 2021 is still going to be kind of this back and forth momentum driven trading.
BEAR14|Remember, we probably have increased lockdowns coming across the country in the United States, as Mr. Biden takes over.
BULL15|I think that's going to be a big deal, and I think part of that is the growth rate is going to be back on again.
BEAR16|And I think the death of tech has been way, way, way too over exaggerated.
NEUT17|You're staying with big Tech, Brian for that reason.
BULL18|Well, we're neutral, so we're market way, which is a big call for us.
NEUT19|Quite frankly, as you know, our work for several years were secular bulls on on tech and communication services were not saying cell tech were saying maintain your position.
NEUT20|Think about this again.
NEUT21|It's 40% of the market.
NEUT22|If you take communication services and technology.
NEUT23|I'm just saying don't sell add-on, weakness and and trim a little bit when the market rallies and I think we have another big move in the stay at home stocks and it's rather contrarian because everyones now decided that's a value market.
NEUT24|But just be careful on that.
NEUT25|Think about this.
NEUT26|You've used several industrial stocks, or at or near all time highs already, and we're financials really where we think you get the best fundamental value.
BEAR27|Most of them are still hovering near all time lows.
NEUT28|"I think that's really going to be the big trade that people are under exposed in."""
