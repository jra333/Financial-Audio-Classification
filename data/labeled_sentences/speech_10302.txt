BEAR0|"""Jim, you did tweet though this morning."
NEUT1|I love a good rally based on nothing.
NEUT2|Is that what today is?
NEUT3|I think so.
NEUT4|We there are a lot of people who feel the late afternoon that maybe interest rates are done going higher and then you've got Janet Yellen.
NEUT5|All this testimony.
NEUT6|You said why?
NEUT7|I don't know that's possible.
NEUT8|At the same time, you don't get a blowout from Bank of America.
NEUT9|You get a block from the much smaller Goldman Sachs.
NEUT10|But let's face it.
NEUT11|I mean, did anything really happen over the three day weekend?
NEUT12|No, but maybe that's what matters.
NEUT13|David, weren't these three days of calm?
NEUT14|Yeah, I guess they were.
BULL15|They were calm well.
NEUT16|In the markets, maybe no real problem for the country in real life really.
NEUT17|Yeah, I mean, we obviously tomorrow's a big day, but I'm just saying that we we didn't see tweets this weekend.
NEUT18|They didn't feel like they didn't see violence right, which there was obviously a lot of concern particularly.
NEUT19|I guess on Sunday or even yesterday that there might be.
NEUT20|So yeah, I guess.
BULL21|I guess that's a fair a fair statement in court.
NEUT22|What I'm seeing is again the same thing over and over again.
NEUT23|It's the specs, backs, backs.
NEUT24|And we're all trying to figure out exactly what these companies are doing, how they're working.
NEUT25|I know David's very interested in some specs, and then I'm looking at Churchill Capital Corp for I spend a week.
NEUT26|I mean, Tom is just talking about it.
NEUT27|Of course it is that statement more or less.
NEUT28|Not saying much of anything, but I hesitate to get involved in that in some ways because the speculative nature of the shareholder base there is such that they are, they're very into you, deal with it all the time, yeah?
NEUT29|You're you're, you're OK with people being very mean to you.
NEUT30|Yeah, I kind of like Jimmy chill.
NEUT31|Jimmy still likes and you block them all.
NEUT32|But yeah, you know there's a lot of conspiracy theory.
NEUT33|Well they have their pathetic parities of the human mind.
NEUT34|I mean, I'm not quite sure what to do with them, but let them do their thing and move around.
NEUT35|And wamma jamma.
NEUT36|But Carl, I'm working certain about whether Goldman Sachs is a true blowout given the fact that this is one of the largest beats I've ever seen.
NEUT37|There's some great notes today about restaurants that make you feel people are coming back.
NEUT38|I don't know.
NEUT39|I guess I could focus on, let's say, retailers that sell David PlayStation an.
NEUT40|You know anything right?
NEUT41|Xbox though.
NEUT42|Yeah, well that's what I noticed you were battling it out and what the borrow is E3 care about the bar.
NEUT43|You know car like that.
NEUT44|There is the speculative nature of this market that we talk about a lot.
NEUT45|It can be reflected to a certain extent of the move of CC Ivy.
NEUT46|That's why we mentioned.
NEUT47|Because of course this is a spec that has yet to announce the deal.
BULL48|But moving up on speculation that it will with another EV car.
NEUT49|Another one of these EV car companies.
NEUT50|But we'll see.
NEUT51|And then every day it's another spec.
NEUT52|I got Omar Ishrak today.
NEUT53|Chairman of Intel.
NEUT54|Remember he's got one sternlicht Barry Sternlicht got his third that he's gonna be pricing summer 50 million bucks and also gores which they had a very good first back.
NEUT55|They got another one coming out in Carl.
NEUT56|I'm not even keeping track, that's just the ones that came up this morning in a couple of conversations Yep.
NEUT57|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT58|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
