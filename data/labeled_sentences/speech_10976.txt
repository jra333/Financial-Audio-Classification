NEUT0|"""It's going to be a video chart on ticker symbol NKLA."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a very rough day today, especially when you factor in how impressive Wednesday was.
NEUT5|I mean, when you stop, think about that.
BEAR6|Wednesday had a low right there and then recover it all the way up to there.
NEUT7|That was a nice bounce, but to have this thing gap down, wipe away all that movement and then just continue on down.
BULL8|Yeah, definitely rough day.
BEAR9|And there's definitely a whole lot of selling pressure that is involved right now, which doesn't guarantee anything.
NEUT10|But my point here is that at least makes it a valid.
NEUT11|At least makes it a rational thought to have that you know what it's looking like.
BEAR12|The price very well could be headed down here to $14.50, which historically speaking.
NEUT13|Very, very important technical level.
BULL14|You go back here and you can see just several times the price went down around that area and to give credit where credit is due, it's held very nicely.
BEAR15|So if the price does go down there again while nothing is guaranteed and I wish I could say train with this easy just because it's bounced off that level several times before does not mean that for sure.
BEAR16|Guaranteed it will bounce off that level again.
NEUT17|Now.
NEUT18|Is that a valid data rational thought proposal?
NEUT19|Throw out there?
NEUT20|Yeah, it absolutely is.
NEUT21|But that doesn't mean that'll for sure happened.
BEAR22|Now in the event the price does go down to 1450 and doesn't hold up above it, so the price pushes down through there.
NEUT23|The next key level of support.
NEUT24|Would then be down there around $14.50 in the event the price of a sudden decides to turn itself around and start to work back upwards first the level of resistance on any sort of attempted bounce.
NEUT25|Would be right up there around $15.50 or excuse me.
NEUT26|$15.15 excuse me and the next level of resistance after that would be right up there around 1560.
BEAR27|But yeah, as of right now things are definitely looking very shaky.
BEAR28|There's very clearly a whole lot of downward selling pressure that's shown up, but we'll see if the price can at least start to get things turned around or not on Friday 1st off.
BULL29|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT39|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT40|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT41|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT42|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT43|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
