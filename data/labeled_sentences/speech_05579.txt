NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is your boy will today will be talking about Plug Power ticker, symbol PLUG and I've been giving you guys the key resistance level in two key support levels going forward and a key level where I think price might go to for next week or so.
NEUT2|An I won't be posting a watch list this week because it is a short week.
NEUT3|As you guys know, the market ends on Thursday 'cause the New Years.
NEUT4|But I will be posting my Top Stock for tomorrow on my Patreon page.
NEUT5|So my page on people y'all get that video around 9:00 o'clock tonight will be my top plate.
NEUT6|I'm looking for it tomorrow but OK, let's get into this video.
NEUT7|So plug power.
NEUT8|I'll show you guys some levels.
NEUT9|So these I would say.
BULL10|So let's take these off very randos and plug power has been having a good move up my Googles up.
NEUT11|This is all just profit taking I believe, so some support levels that I see.
NEUT12|Are 3302.
NEUT13|Here is the first support level, the second support level I see is 2969.
NEUT14|Play my 69.
NEUT15|Around there, so these are two support levels and then a resistance level.
NEUT16|I see is 33.8.
NEUT17|33.8 right here, let's make that red.
NEUT18|OK, so going forward like tomorrow, Thursday and next week Monday either three key levels that I'll be looking at.
NEUT19|And I really think this level is a good buying opportunity, so I might just wait for it to get down here.
NEUT20|I think that would be a very good buying opportunity level, but for right now your resistance level is 33.87.
NEUT21|We want to see if it comes up higher reacts at this level because if it does come through this level and test it as support resistance turned support then we can be more bullish.
NEUT22|But right now we want to see how we react if it comes aboard the support level as well.
NEUT23|Could this support level?
NEUT24|This is a resist level, or if we want to see if it stays below this level and start raining down here I will be buying at this level or I will be buying when this resistance returns back and touch to support.
NEUT25|So this was this is level 33.87.
NEUT26|The support level is 3302 and this level is 29.6.
NEUT27|So these are my 3 levels that I'm watching.
NEUT28|This is the main key level that I'm looking to buy out for power.
NEUT29|I will probably go a little heavy on that, but I was sitting that alert on my Patreon page as well.
NEUT30|But this is a little I am looking to heavy at and this is a key support and key resistance, so that's not playing plug.
NEUT31|You guys like the video.
NEUT32|Remember this?
NEUT33|None of record is not a recommendation of ourselves, anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT34|So do not say anything you see here in this video.
NEUT35|"I'll catch you guys on next one."""
