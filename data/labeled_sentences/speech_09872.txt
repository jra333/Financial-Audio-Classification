NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will now.
NEUT3|In this video I will be talking about GameStop stock ticker symbol GME.
NEUT4|Now let me give you guys the main keys level I'm looking at.
NEUT5|Right, and just because there's a buying level doesn't mean we buy right when it hits it, OK?
BEAR6|We need to see buying pressure.
NEUT7|This is what I'll be looking for.
BULL8|When it hits this level OK, buying pressure comes back.
BULL9|Now shoots up again.
NEUT10|OK, this is the room we want to catch, not the first initial run.
NEUT11|We want to catch that second run.
NEUT12|OK, just a second run alone.
NEUT13|Was over 10% and that's you know my minimum for place.
NEUT14|So this would be looking for at this level OK, but first make sure you guys smash that like button subscribe and also turn publication so you don't miss any updates resistance level at 232.60.
NEUT15|Have this on your chart.
BULL16|It has not hit there yet as you can tell they got close to two 3147 and it resisted.
BEAR17|So this is a strong resistance whenever priced gives this close and doesn't hit it.
BULL18|That means this is a strong resistance pushing price down right.
NEUT19|We had this pop up but all that was just a fake move.
BEAR20|'cause it came back down and then settle down today.
NEUT21|So these are major levels you want to have 232.60 and the buying level is 170.4.
NEUT22|Now if you want to know when I'm getting in, make sure you follow the Discord link down below.
BEAR23|I have about 40 more members and once that's gone it will be closed.
NEUT24|So make sure you get those link down below.
NEUT25|But by level 170.4 is where my main focus is actually put an alert.
NEUT26|Wanted to do.
NEUT27|169 wanted to see.
BEAR28|170.4 below at or below OK.
NEUT29|So whenever it hits this level, I'll get alerted and then I'll wait to see if we see some buying pressure.
NEUT30|If we don't, then I won't begin in, but if we do this type of buying pressure OK and will try to catch a calculate on this second move.
NEUT31|OK, so that's why I'm looking forward my main focus video.
NEUT32|A short not too much to look at.
NEUT33|As you can tell.
BEAR34|There's been trading aside range.
NEUT35|Try not to get stuck in this right here.
NEUT36|We want dynamic moves, dynamic, dynamic, OK, but overall is going around back to the same price like it went up.
NEUT37|Came back down, went up, came back down right.
NEUT38|So just focus on here.
NEUT39|170.4 resistance 232.60 in between.
BEAR40|Here neutral OK. Now if I do see buying pressure and I get in here my exit would be 10% so maybe it comes up comes back down.
NEUT41|Maybe my average is around when it 180 just calculate 10% from that.
NEUT42|And then you'll get my exit around 200.
NEUT43|OK, so if you guys like this video, join a Discord link down below for bias alerts and then this recommendation bar so anything is vegetation purposes only.
NEUT44|So do not try anything.
NEUT45|You're his videos, not catch you guys in the next one.
NEUT46|"Bye."""
