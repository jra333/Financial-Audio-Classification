BEAR0|"""Alright, well getting back to what Miles was saying in some of these big high Flyers here falling out of favor."
NEUT1|We were talking about Tesla.
BULL2|We were talking about Apple, but Square today is under a little bit of pressure and Andy, Sir, I know that this is a name that you have been watching it very closely has been a clear winner over the past several months.
BULL3|Shares rallying by almost 30% in the last month alone up over 160% since the start of the year.
BEAR4|And of course this comes at a time when a lot of the bank stocks have continued to underperform.
NEUT5|Yeah, and you know it's interesting when you talked about stocks, groups that were underperforming today you said energy and then you said, well, we've also got Apple and Tesla like I have a new category.
BEAR6|A new industry groups insane stocks and the insane stocks were down a little bit today like Apple Tesla, Zoom CRM was down a little bit right as well.
BEAR7|Interestingly, poor folks at Dow Jones.
NEUT8|They just put CRM and Apple into the index.
BEAR9|And now they're down.
BEAR10|First time I've been down ever.
NEUT11|After they go in the index.
NEUT12|But that's OK. That always happens when they add to the index like that.
NEUT13|Yeah, and square.
NEUT14|You know it has been a high fire, of course.
NEUT15|The interesting thing to me that with these companies is what's it gonna be like after the dust settles now that's not going to settle for a long time and others when we get back to normal an I actually I'm of the mind that is not going to be for 18 months.
NEUT16|I I think that you know not only is second half of this year most nine months of this year going to be sort of a wash or whole different world, but I think 2021 is as well when we start to get the vaccine and then people still get herd immunity.
NEUT17|Plus the vaccine together and we'll start to see next fall what the world looks.
NEUT18|Like in the spring of the following year, we're kind of back to normal and you can argue with me all you want.
NEUT19|I'm sure I'm wrong, but I'm just putting it out there and then.
NEUT20|The question is, what is zoom look like or square look like at that point?
NEUT21|OK, and zoom, I don't know.
NEUT22|I mean, sure, it's for real and they're going to be people zooming, but people will be back in the office having real meetings square I think is a slightly different story today notwithstanding, because I think this was just sort of a momentum booster and I think that this company is not ever going to really be looking back, in other words.
NEUT23|People who are adopting square are not going to UN adopt square after covid.
NEUT24|Because it has so many benefits that legacy banking institutions don't have, it feels different gaps.
NEUT25|It's much more efficient etc etc.
NEUT26|So I mean again, JPM is not going away.
NEUT27|You know neither of the regional banks is just like this.
NEUT28|That company is going to take a huge swath out of their business permanently as opposed to some of these other.
NEUT29|You know ups and downs a little bit.
BEAR30|Yeah, I certainly do agree that we talk about there's consumers changing their behavior and now the coronavirus pandemic has kind of exacerbated some of those differences here between the winners and losers.
BULL31|And it's really given some companies opportunity to capitalize on this environment.
BULL32|And square is clearly a winner here and has positioned themselves to be a winner.
NEUT33|"Now for quite a sometime."""
