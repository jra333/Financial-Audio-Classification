NEUT0|"""Well, is this legit?"
NEUT1|Yes, I'd say that the way your viewers might want question.
NEUT2|This is when did rallies fail in 0902 and 87 and that is how much of the loss did they recover before it became a double bottom.
NEUT3|That level again simply today would be 2475.
NEUT4|If this was 2009, so you never had more than a 25% retrace, or if it's 87 and O2, it's a 38% retrace which is 2600.
BEAR5|So the SNP is beyond what would normally be.
NEUT6|Hey this is the ceiling and you're going to.
BEAR7|It's an interim bottom in every test alone and I think the key number is 2793.
BEAR8|'cause that means you've recovered half of your losses if we get to 2793, that's typically telling us we're deep into a bull market.
NEUT9|Recovery and you know something that I think we've been writing about.
NEUT10|It is like, you know, these declines tend to be symmetric.
NEUT11|That's something that people think this will take a long time to resolve faster you fall the faster recovery.
NEUT12|Historically you recover half your losses in half the time you fell.
NEUT13|So this means that we could see 2800 before the end of the month, I know, but it seems absurd.
NEUT14|Tom frankly to beats up using the words bull market.
BULL15|In the current environment, just just because the numbers in New York and maybe elsewhere to seem to be improving a bit, there's a long way to go.
BEAR16|I feel uncomfortable almost using those words.
NEUT17|Yeah Scott, I agree it makes no sense, but I would say that I'm not going to try to tell the market what to do.
NEUT18|I'm going to try to maybe understand what the markets doing, and there's three reasons this could be happening.
BEAR19|One is the crisis could be ending faster than expected.
NEUT20|Remember the White House originally thought 2,000,000 mortality.
BEAR21|It looks like we're going to understand that the second is the consumer could come back huge, which is why the retailers and the industrials are bouncing.
NEUT22|Remember, if you look at.
BEAR23|Low market value per employee stocks.
NEUT24|They're the ones that got hit the hardest, but they're the ones that will benefit from labor supply.
NEUT25|And the third is that policy makers acted quickly.
BULL26|So if one of those three is true, maybe This is why the market is staging strong recovery.
NEUT27|But when does the economy have to begin to reopen for your thesis to play out?
NEUT28|What upsets it?
NEUT29|Yes, it's a great question, so we've written about how.
NEUT30|If you look at prior market bottoms, stocks bottom before jobless, claims peak in O2, it was about six weeks in 09 it was roughly three weeks.
BEAR31|So basically before jobless claims peak, the stock market will bottom.
BEAR32|And GDP typically takes another year to recover to its previous level.
BEAR33|But stocks are already deep into a recovery, so I think the first derivative is jobless claims.
BEAR34|"That number could be peaking within the next month, and if it does, that means the March 23 bottom could be the actual low."""
