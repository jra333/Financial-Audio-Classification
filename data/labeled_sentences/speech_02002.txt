NEUT3|Keep up the daily videos and check out the links in the description.
BULL4|Looking at the stock today, the stock closed today $1.86 up about 19% on the day and you can see from looking at the chart that the stock started to run up in price towards the end of the day.
NEUT5|So let's take a look at the news to see why this happened.
NEUT6|The first news we got was early in the day and that was the insiders are buying fifty 6298 shares.
BULL7|At $2.01 per share, so this is great, and it shows that they are expecting big things that come in the future for the company.
NEUT8|And then towards the end of the day we got a company filing that Spark that run that we saw towards the end of the day into the clothes.
NEUT9|We had a filing come out for the company showing 8K filing for the company to enter into an agreement with AMC to buy equipment.
BULL10|So it's great that we keep any news from the company and we're seeing the stock price started to climb back up.
NEUT11|And I talked about the stock a few days ago, covering the rumors about NFTS, which then got confirmed by the CEO on Twitter right after that video came out.
BULL12|So there's a lot of great stuff coming from the company going forward.
BULL13|We should hopefully be in a bigger FTA Company Announcement soon, and as we talked about in the last video, see IDM already has an analyst price target $3.25 even before all this news in FT hype, this equipment purchase that we saw was a big step for the company to cover their debt and become more profitable in the long run.
BULL14|Overall, today was a pretty good day.
BULL15|We saw some green returned to the market and the stock had a huge day.
BULL16|Going forward for the stock, I think within the next couple of weeks there's a good chance that we could see this stock reached $3 or higher.
NEUT17|What do you guys think about the stock?
