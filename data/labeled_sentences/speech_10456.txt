BEAR0|"""Question is, have we come too far too fast?"
BULL1|What do you think with the markets we have come back 65% from the lows just like we did back in 2000 and eight 2009.
BULL2|But this time the economy is in much better shape.
BULL3|There are more supports there than there were last time around and hopefully hopefully we get through and get these vaccines out quickly.
NEUT4|Where do you come down on this?
BEAR5|If we run too far too fast as the market saying?
NEUT6|Sorry, I don't think so.
NEUT7|I think that the technology stocks uniquely set up for a pandemic.
NEUT8|The comeback stocks make a lot of sense given the fact that we're not that far from.
NEUT9|What you use the term vaccine blood this morning?
NEUT10|I think that's certainly a possibility of JJ plays out.
NEUT11|I actually thought that the package then I intervened are packages.
NEUT12|He was very well thought out.
BEAR13|I know it's considered slapdash, I don't think so.
BULL14|The unemployment benefits are really good.
BULL15|Some of the of the money that given toward vaccine contact tracing these are all very good.
BEAR16|But the most important is I don't think the $600 is completely idle when combined with the unemployment, you're going to tide people over to the vaccine.
NEUT17|Becky.
NEUT18|So no, I'm I, I just don't buy the negativity here.
NEUT19|I thought that's what you were going to say and you know it's interesting.
NEUT20|We could always try and find how things rhyme with last time around, but this time it really is different.
NEUT21|Yes it is, and I think that there's also I had robinwood on last night.
NEUT22|There's a lot of new money coming in, maybe 16 million strong with people who have discretionary income.
NEUT23|You might say, well, listen, what they should really just put it in the bank or put food on the table that if they have no job and I think that's a lot of people have no job.
NEUT24|But this is the Niner billion bridge.
BULL25|Anne, what I always your doctor, Gottlieb talk about in the morning really make me feel like even yesterday with the so called electric strain that they're talking about that we may be in better shape.
NEUT26|It's a footrace obviously backing footrace to vaccine.
NEUT27|But when you see all these people come on, they have vaccine.
NEUT28|I said, like, hey, jeez, I mean, maybe this thing is going to get to us sooner than we think.
BEAR29|I know that seems completely wrong from the negatives that I hear, but if a lot of it depends on JJ, JJ's ready, then they're going to have a billion vaccines.
NEUT30|I think in wow, that's just very, very, let's say aggressive but possible.
BULL31|Would be great.
NEUT32|A billion vaccines that take one shot so it works a lot more quickly too.
NEUT33|Let's just cross our fingers.
NEUT34|I think that J&J and they can certainly correct and obviously, but I know that I had emergent bio one and what they're talking about is really pretty much of a you know what in tandem.
NEUT35|Let's just make it.
NEUT36|And if it works, we're ready, and that's highly unusual.
NEUT37|And that's what I understand to be the case, not denied.
NEUT38|And what an amazing thing, if you actually are making something already, and if it gets approved, wow.
NEUT39|Everybody gets something that would be so great so I'm not.
BEAR40|I'm a pessimist only in the sense that there were so many things that went wrong before we got the bill.
NEUT41|And I'm an optimist going for it.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
