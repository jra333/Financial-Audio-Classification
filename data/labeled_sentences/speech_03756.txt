NEUT0|"""Hey fools Brandon Matthews here, joined by Jason Moser on our Ask a full segment."
NEUT1|We've got a great question from fat or faps he or she says I want to get my kids started investing.
NEUT2|I want to start them off with $1000 then add periodic contributions.
NEUT3|What are some index funds that would be best to start with now?
NEUT4|Jason, I think first of all I think it's great to get your kids started investing early, but what do you think?
NEUT5|What kind of index funds would you look at?
NEUT6|Well I think.
NEUT7|Number one, I would look at the questions I would answer trying to answer the questions whether you should use an index fund or perhaps an exchange traded fund and ETF so you know we're stock guys first and foremost.
NEUT8|So when it comes to questions like these, I love looking to our rule.
NEUT9|Your retirement service headed up by Robert Brokamp, 'cause they do a lot of sort of digging in those funds and understanding the advantages and disadvantages the pros and cons.
NEUT10|And so if we look at index funds for example, index funds don't really do anything fancy, just trying to beat the market.
NEUT11|I mean they don't try to match the market match the market.
NEUT12|And basically right, they track a specific index, whatever that index.
NEUT13|Maybe you know they're typically much cheaper than you're actively managed.
NEUT14|Types of mutual funds, but like you said, you're never going to really do much more than just match the market.
NEUT15|If you look to an exchange traded fund exchange traded funds are very much like index funds, a little bit different, though, in that they trade basically on a share basis, so you can actually trade them through the day.
NEUT16|I mean, you could buy shares of an ETF, whereas an index fund is going somewhere just settles up once per day.
NEUT17|But but again, I think with an exchange traded fund, you're essentially, you know if you're if you're following something like like the S&P index for example.
BULL18|You're basically just committing yourself to try to match that markets returns now over the long haul, I think that's a great idea because you can see historically markets go up, you know?
BULL19|I mean, the S&P index is 7500, index has been quite a performer overtime, and so being able to match those returns certainly outpace the miniscule interest rates that you're going to get today from CDs or savings accounts, and it gives you an opportunity as well.
NEUT20|To learn about the businesses within those index funds.
NEUT21|So I think I would probably look maybe at an exchange traded fund first and foremost and then try to find something that's geared around the S&P 500 so that you can try to get as much diversity there as possible.
NEUT22|What about you?
BULL23|So I totally agree.
NEUT24|I would just say when you're picking an index fund, look for something that's a broad market index, so the S&P 500 would be a good one, or a total market index.
NEUT25|Look for low costs an I would say check out Vanguard there.
NEUT26|Known for low cost, very well run index mutual funds.
NEUT27|Yeah, I mean I'll take this one step further as a father with two girls myself and there's seven and a half and nine years old now, and I've I've been working to get them into investing an.
NEUT28|I mean, I think the index fund or exchange traded fund is a great approach, and certainly a good part to a diversified portfolio.
NEUT29|Take advantage, you know.
NEUT30|Kids love to learn.
NEUT31|I think it's a great time at that age to learn about businesses and investing.
NEUT32|So maybe jump in there, try to learn a little bit about some particular companies.
NEUT33|And maybe you know buy shares.
NEUT34|In some companies that those kids are really interested in that you feel like have good long term prospects because those can serve you know.
NEUT35|Also is learning lesson tremendous lessons as well.
NEUT36|So it's a great time to really be digging into this stuff.
NEUT37|So take advantage of all the tools that are out there.
BULL38|Great thanks Jason.
