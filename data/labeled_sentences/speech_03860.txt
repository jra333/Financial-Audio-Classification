NEUT0|"""Hello, this is Steve Forbes and welcome to what's ahead."
NEUT1|President Trump has announced a new council that will be appointed next week to make plans and reopening the battered American economy.
BEAR2|With unemployment rising.
NEUT3|So what do we do next?
NEUT4|Here are two things this new Council should recommend.
NEUT5|One is a one year suspension of the payroll tax, which is FICA on your payroll stub.
NEUT6|That would do two big things immediately.
NEUT7|It would give working people enormous raise if you make $40,000 a year, that would be a $3000 annual raise.
NEUT8|But it also means for employers it costs less to hire people, so it has a double bang for the Buck.
NEUT9|More money for the workers, less costs for the employer.
BULL10|This is a way to reduce unemployment quickly.
NEUT11|Another thing the Council should recommend is reducing the capital gains tax.
BULL12|That would help raise the price of stocks good for 401K's, pension plans, municipal pension plans, state pension plans and the like.
NEUT13|But also be an incentive to invest more in the economy as it.
NEUT14|Opens up which we will really need.
NEUT15|There's an extra bonus here too.
BULL16|100 years of experience has shown that when you reduce the capital gains tax rate, revenues immediately increase in Washington.
NEUT17|Why?
NEUT18|Because you don't penalize people for selling assets so much, so they sell assets, take the gain, reinvest the proceeds elsewhere.
BULL19|Perhaps a new startup that's great for the economy.
BULL20|So this is a winner all around.
NEUT21|Here's another thing that should be done to get the economy moving again.
NEUT22|Get us out of this recession.
NEUT23|Least provide a lifeline until we get the economy opened up.
NEUT24|And that is the Federal Reserve should get off.
BEAR25|It's tough and get its Main Street lending program up and running.
NEUT26|This program for supposed to provide money for mid sized companies.
NEUT27|But the way the Fed is going, the money won't be flowing until May or June.
BEAR28|The house is on fire.
NEUT29|We need the hoses running now.
NEUT30|Not in May or June.
BULL31|And finally good news on the treatment front.
NEUT32|There was a test in France of Hydroxychloroquine.
NEUT33|Over 1000 patients run by world recognized experts.
BULL34|The result and over 90% success rate in rapidly treating this terrible disease.
BULL35|That's good news here and around the world.
NEUT36|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT37|Thank you for listening.
BULL38|"Look forward to talking with you soon again."""
