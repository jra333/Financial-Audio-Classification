BEAR0|"""Stocks set to fall at the open as futures overnight, hitting their limit down levels once again."
NEUT1|This is one of the first times I think Andrew, that the federal service announced something in the market has actually gone up an urgent situation for Congress to pass this.
BULL2|But we are ready and we are working with them to provide unprecedented liquidity, and we looked like we were going to be down then we looked like we might open much higher as a result of the Fed action, and now I'm trying to figure out where things are going to stand.
BEAR3|The sell off is deepening as we move throughout the session.
BEAR4|Today, the Dow is now down more than 900 point.
BULL5|We're very close to reaching a deal.
BULL6|Very close.
BULL7|And our goal is to reach a deal.
NEUT8|Today we are reacting a little bit to Schumer's comment about a deal being close, so let's take a look.
BEAR9|You can see the markets here still down, the Dow is down 600 points or thereabouts, 3.3% as the Senate fails to advance the stimulus bill for the second time in a procedural vote down now, more than 860 points on the Dow.
BULL10|Another big volatility thousand point swing in the Dow 100 points in the S&P 500.
BULL11|We closed off the low.
BULL12|Yeah, what a year it's been.
NEUT13|Jim Ryan.
NEUT14|Just wanna be sure you know people.
NEUT15|The problem.
NEUT16|I mentioned the cruises, CDC director or Shovel Lenski, but one of the things that was really lost during the period was public health issue.
NEUT17|It was not a issue about business and I think everyone struggled with the idea that well, we can do whatever we want.
NEUT18|We can throw any money, throw money at it, but Jaypal had the clearest vision.
NEUT19|He knew that it was public health and he wanted to make it so that there was a bridge to when we had a vaccine.
NEUT20|Yeah, well here we are.
NEUT21|This vision and it was right.
NEUT22|It was, we know.
NEUT23|Obviously it was not a financial crisis.
BEAR24|Now we had a number of companies that were in potentially very difficult straits as a result of having a lot of debt at that point.
NEUT25|And we clearly had no idea where we would be six months later, let alone a year in terms of how the ability to repair their balance sheets.
BULL26|But the Fed to your point came to the rescue, so to speak.
BULL27|In many ways its balance sheet has now just grown enormously.
NEUT28|Where is it over 7?
NEUT29|Trillion, we just added another 1.9 trillion.
BEAR30|We've got the prospect of even more spending Jim coming from this administration.
NEUT31|They want to pursue infrastructure.
BULL32|Many, many businesses are very much supportive of that effort, but it has been extraordinary.
NEUT33|Well, I just I come back to.
NEUT34|I mean, I know Andrew, or short converted very interesting piece about how the airlines got a bailout.
NEUT35|But I remember David people felt that airlines where where you got covid.
NEUT36|So the airline issue was done.
NEUT37|It turned out to be not the place you got covid remember, people felt you got covid from surface is well turned out there was one place but it was really error soul so it was a novel virus.
NEUT38|We didn't know what we were doing.
NEUT39|We didn't, but you know what?
NEUT40|It's interesting is you're still talking about there being a lack of clarity in certain types of behaviors.
NEUT41|Now that we're obviously Terrell, very thankfully getting inoculated and yet there are still those questions, and it's been throughout in terms of trying to understand the right behavior in the wrong and obviously very different perceptions of that throughout the country which contributed to what?
BEAR42|We're talking over 540,000 people have died.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
