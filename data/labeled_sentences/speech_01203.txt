BULL1|Hey Jim, thanks for taking my call.
NEUT2|Of course I have a question about his Excel sleep.
BEAR3|I know you spoke about in mid December Pre merger and the stock has risen to 35 and came back down to 120.
NEUT4|I bought some around 21 and was looking to kind of buy some more by question is with several analysts giving the stock price between 30 and 60 and the company being one of those EV that actually has cars on the road.
NEUT5|Should I buy more or should I be worried about this one?
NEUT6|Internet we're going over this group, and I think that this is the most popular group that I can find of all these companies that are coming public.
NEUT7|Why?
NEUT8|Because we have a body administration and we gotta clean the door and air.
BULL9|And I think there's a consensus building about that.
BULL10|I think you're in good shape.
NEUT11|Thank you.
NEUT12|Kind comments.
NEUT13|Everybody wants a piece of the electric vehicle action making the charging stations compelling.
