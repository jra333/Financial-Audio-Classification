NEUT0|"""OK, people, welcome back to the YouTube channel."
BULL1|Today we're going to be talking about XPEV, which is X paying one of the one of the competitors that is compared to competitors competing in the Chinese EV market.
NEUT2|So that's nearly autos X pang.
NEUT3|Recently IP owed about I think it was like a year ago or maybe a year and a half ago.
NEUT4|Perhaps two years at it.
NEUT5|Very recently, although we can see that the all time high here is about 77 point two 777.38.
BEAR6|OK, we can see that there was a strong bearish trend up until about 28th of December 2020.
BEAR7|We see we see this bearish trend, but it really bottoms out here when the RSI breaks like it hits like 15, which is crazy low, which signifies a momentum reversal and then we started this bullish trend on XP EV.
NEUT8|This is, you know, it's not really one of those really regular, but it's strange.
NEUT9|But it is still a bit of trend because see the higher lows and higher highs.
NEUT10|This is if we zoom in here this is this is in fact a higher high so we can see the higher, higher, higher, higher, higher highs.
BULL11|So that is the starting of a bullish trend.
NEUT12|OK, price prediction.
NEUT13|OK, let's talk about the Ma.
NEUT14|We have the 200 day MA plotted on the graph.
NEUT15|And as you guys know, when the when the MA when the price action is above the MA that is a bullish indication when the price action is below the MA.
BEAR16|That is in bearish indication.
NEUT17|Now we can see here that the AMA has been used to test.
NEUT18|Sorry my God has been test has been used to test as a level of support and resistance in some circumstances, but not as much as we can see here that it's been used as a level resistance level of support, level of support and right here sort of support, but it's or it's broken through the 200 day level MA which is, you know, it's a sign of bearishness.
NEUT19|But not to worry, we can also look at some you know some key levels of resistance we can see.
NEUT20|I believe right here that is a key level of resistance.
NEUT21|You know it is touched it a few like four or five times here and key level of well support would be around would be around here.
NEUT22|Will be around here.
BULL23|That would be a key level of support.
BULL24|So for this price prediction or further for this price action for me to be bullish on this, OK, I would want to see or for me to open a position on XPVI would want to see the price to come above 200 DMA again and also for it to break this very this line of support plus resistance.
BULL25|So when if it breaks this so I would want to see this price break the MA so come up and come across the EMEA once more and also to break this key level of support slash resistance at 51.36.
NEUT26|And again, this is the second all time high, which is 59.63.
NEUT27|If it crosses 59.63, so if it crosses 51.36 and then 59.63 disc price price action, could you know it could rock it?
BEAR28|But look looking at it right now the RSI has extended past the 39, which means a momentum reversal.
NEUT29|So it looks like there could be could be a bullish trend coming up through here.
NEUT30|Yeah.
NEUT31|So highlighting what we need to see for a bullish trend will need to see it break through the 200 day MA breakthrough 51.36 and breakthrough 59.63 for a massive parabolic surge.
BULL32|And those guys I hope you guys enjoyed the video.
