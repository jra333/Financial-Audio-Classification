NEUT0|"""Bring in John Freeman, Vice president of equity research at CFR a Jaune."
NEUT1|What's your initial take on these?
NEUT2|These snap numbers?
BEAR3|And do you agree with Julie as to why the stock is down 4 or 5%?
NEUT4|Yeah I do.
BEAR5|I'm actually surprised it's not down even more.
BULL6|I mean the revenue beat was in a decent area, sort of in line ish almost.
BULL7|There were some impressive numbers with regard to user.
NEUT8|A much higher user engagement, but that makes sense given you know the sheltering in place.
NEUT9|Those are things I think that have already been known.
NEUT10|Well, I wanted to see was financial discipline and I didn't really get to see that.
BULL11|And you know, they're they're projecting, you know, costs to continue to grow in the mid 20s.
NEUT12|I mean, I think.
BULL13|There's a time now to realize the operational leverage that's inherent in this business, and I think the time is now to at least demonstrate you know that it's you know that we're going to get closer to, you know, demonstrating the ability to to to, to, to narrow the loss, right, and and, and to hit break even.
NEUT14|And I don't see you, I, I think, technically even a marginalized, they actually.
BEAR15|The loss widened.
BEAR16|So for me, a little disappointing.
BULL17|Long term, though, use is not the key metric which was strong for the quarter and still growing next quarter.
NEUT18|Even if it's not as quickly.
NEUT19|Right, I mean, I, I think the user growth was fine actually, and I wasn't, as you know, invested in that.
BEAR20|And also it makes sense that that ARPU average revenue producer would decline in a situation where you know advertising budgets are going to get frozen or cut or whatever.
BULL21|I understand all of that, but you know it's I think with the with the with the given given the revenue growth, I think they could have really shown a lot.
NEUT22|You know a lot more.
NEUT23|A lot more legs, so to speak, in terms of profitability, and I'm not sure why they're thinking that you know upping their spend now, or continuing to to sort of investing growth rather than to pull back a little bit.
NEUT24|I think it's a little overly aggressive given a company that you know is never never made, never made a profit, right?
NEUT25|So it's concerning.
NEUT26|John, I wanted to talk about your price target on the stock $14.00 with a hold.
BEAR27|I mean you missed the big move higher here and it doesn't sound like you're capitulating like a lot of these other analysts.
NEUT28|Following the price higher.
NEUT29|But that that's right, I mean, so I I changed my recommendation from celada sell on it when I think it like non box and I thought the valuation was attractive and there was some.
BEAR30|There's some tremendous upside potential with this company, but I get very nervous, particularly in a downturn when a company is still struggling to.
NEUT31|I mean, I'm not gonna even demand profitability, you know instantaneously.
NEUT32|But you gotta start to narrow the loss when you know the macro.
NEUT33|Frequently macroeconomic situation is a little more, you know, you know.
NEUT34|Unpredictable, right?
NEUT35|Let's just I just think that's being prudent.
BULL36|I think the company is very innovative and and as you know, there's there's tremendous upside potential.
NEUT37|I just don't think the risk is worth the reward at this point.
NEUT38|John Freeman.
BULL39|"Thanks for joining us."""
