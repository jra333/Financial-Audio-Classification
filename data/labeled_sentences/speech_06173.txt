NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of CME Group is range between $4.57 per share and $69.66 per share."
NEUT1|How were those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $4.57 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $4.57 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $69.66 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings, a price of $69.66 per share represents the fractional payment that we don't pay.
NEUT4|For the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT5|Now this is a conservative way to value a company using future earnings, which slightly differs from the results you get by calculating the company's price to earnings ratio.
NEUT6|So what are they trading at today?
NEUT7|CME Group is currently trading at a price of 162, with $0.41.
NEUT8|Of course, this is much higher than our high end for the intrinsic value calculation, which means the reasonable conclusion.
NEUT9|They are overpriced.
NEUT10|What's the next step?
NEUT11|We still have to find a place to park our money.
NEUT12|If it's not CME Group, then we need some alternative that will yield a similar return.
NEUT13|Mitigate our risk all while maintaining safety of principle with an ample margin of safety.
NEUT14|If you're defensive investor like myself, you will feel an affinity towards index funds specifically the Vanguard 500 index fund is the one I like an advocate because Warren Buffett likes it.
NEUT15|This is the same phone he used to beat up the hedge fund guys in New York City and OH, wait through 18 so I figured what why?
NEUT16|If it was good for him, why wouldn't it be good for me?
NEUT17|Look at this 10 year return, 12.98%.
BEAR18|I'm down for that.
NEUT19|So this is where we park our money until this price.
BEAR20|Drops two or below $69.66 per share, barring any new publications.
NEUT21|Or it may be some time is elapsed since.
NEUT22|You know, since you're may be watching this video when they've released a new 10K, just check the 10K, do the calculation again.
NEUT23|High End calculation is just their median net earnings for the past 20 years, times 20, all divided by their shares outstanding.
NEUT24|Issued and outstanding.
NEUT25|Low end is just cash and cash equivalents divided by their shares issued and outstanding.
