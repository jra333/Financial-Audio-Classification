NEUT0|"""What's up, ladies and gentlemen, it's crews will be back here with another video, and today I want to talk about Netflix."
NEUT1|But before we do that, make sure you like, comment and subscribe.
NEUT2|We're on the road of 500 subscribers so hit that button and if you want free stock check on my link down below.
NEUT3|All right, let's get in the video.
NEUT4|So Netflix had their earnings today and let's just say it didn't go too well for the company they were at about 5:26 pre earnings and then they settled at around 479 after the market ended today.
NEUT5|But if we take a look at their financials there pretty good to be honest.
NEUT6|So they had about 10.1 million new subscribers which basically beat the expectations they had about 8.2 and then again, you know this beat the expectation of both FactSet analysts and also Netflix in general.
BEAR7|Again going downwards, they had about an expected earnings per share of about 1.81 according to FactSet, and then they should just below that peak of 1.59.
NEUT8|Because they spend a lot on their costs.
BULL9|So even though Netflix is, revenue was a lot higher than the revenue that the FactSet analysts analyzed or expected of 6.08 billion, they had higher costs.
NEUT10|And in relation to that.
BEAR11|That's why they're expected earnings per share or actual earnings per share were a lot lower.
NEUT12|Also, something that didn't go too well for Netflix will say when it came to the forecast of third quarter.
NEUT13|They're only expecting 2.5 million.
BEAR14|Additional subscribers in quarter three and that could easily go down in quarter four are result of that.
NEUT15|Is that people got a little wary and they said OK. Well if the Q3 projections aren't that well, and then you know what does that even tell us for Q4 and so on.
BEAR16|Let's have a little sell off here and that's basically what we saw here is that people saw the mistakes that happened and they lost a little faith in the forecast.
BEAR17|And because of that we saw about a 10% drop right when earnings happen.
NEUT18|But then you know it slowly came back up and sitting around here and then also they had a quick change by adding a Newell Co CEO.
NEUT19|Which was something they mentioned, but it wasn't really a big shock or big play.
NEUT20|But why I think this doesn't matter is in the long run.
BULL21|Netflix is going to recover from this.
NEUT22|OK, let's just go back to these charts.
NEUT23|Netflix is a subscription company that a lot of people use.
NEUT24|A lot of people know more, so something that Netflix has that not a lot of other streaming platforms have, like Roku and Apple's getting into this, but they're still not as matured in this environment is that they have their own content.
BEAR25|Netflix has been put out originals left, right and center.
BULL26|And people are loving them, and the more the internalizer content creation it's going to be a lot better for the company because it just lowers their costs.
BULL27|Additionally, Netflix is going to continue growing just because the demands there for people aren't going to cancel Netflix right after this these few months, right?
BULL28|People are going to be hooked onto it through going to continue staying there, going to continue providing.
NEUT29|So I really don't think Netflix is big sell in my opinion, right?
BEAR30|It did have a 10% crash today, but in the end of the.
BULL31|Today you have to keep in mind that it's going to quickly recover, right?
NEUT32|It's just a earnings play at this point, right?
BULL33|But at the end of the day, Netflix is going to continue rising, 'cause it's very stable company.
NEUT34|They have a lot in store.
NEUT35|Their competitors aren't that many.
BULL36|OK, they only have a few competitors, but I think I think Netflix is great by in the long run.
BULL37|This 10% drop isn't going to matter is going to continue rising.
NEUT38|I could see the stock going past 500 within the next few weeks or even a few months, so let me know what you guys think.
NEUT39|And also in the next one.
NEUT40|"Take care."""
