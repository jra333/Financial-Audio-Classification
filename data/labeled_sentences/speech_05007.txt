BULL0|"""Hey good afternoon everyone."
NEUT1|Happy Monday to you Tom for our chart of the week and we're going to profile Netflix here and it's actually looking like a pretty bearish chart.
NEUT2|Let's take a look at it.
NEUT3|Will mark it up as we go along here?
NEUT4|One of the things that we've noticed about Netflix here, and we're bearish on this one.
BULL5|We've had some put place working and actually have done pretty well last couple of times.
NEUT6|We roll it into more recently into in November 90 put.
BEAR7|So we have a little bit of room left to go here, but we could see a series of lower highs and lower lows have formed a downtrend line of resistance right there.
NEUT8|That is true in there, but was interesting here is that we can see.
BEAR9|On the last move upwards on relative strength, here we have we have a lower high over here, and that's pretty important over here and then.
BEAR10|Also we have a rejection down here on the momentum indicator, which is the Williams percent R stochastic is rolled over here.
BULL11|We were trying to make some improvements here in the last couple of days on the Mac D, and in fact it looked like we were going to be putting in a little mini W over here.
NEUT12|We have left left side over here.
NEUT13|In fact, let me draw that in for you.
NEUT14|Here we have the left side here at the base up pull up.
BULL15|After that and then I re test and then a move back up and it looked like it was going to pass this area.
BEAR16|Here we were going to have a nice bullish move, probably to click fill that gap up to about 100 and 15116 area, but that didn't come to pass today we were down.
NEUT17|When the market was up.
BULL18|We did have some elevated volume here.
NEUT19|In the month of September so far from.
BULL20|This W pattern the market actually doing far better than the Netflix here.
BEAR21|In fact, this stock is down for the month of September and the market is up or slightly negative.
NEUT22|So which is interesting?
BEAR23|So we do have very poor relative strength on Netflix, which is interesting because some of the other.
BULL24|Big High beta technology names have done far better.
NEUT25|When you look at a Facebook you look in an Apple, even look at Amazon or a Google.
BEAR26|These stocks have done a lot better and they haven't, and Netflix hasn't gotten the message here.
BEAR27|I think that if we get another down day over here Tuesday or Wednesday, we're probably going to come back and test these low levels here of 95 one more time and probably fail and reject and start heading down towards this 200 moving average, which is about 80 bucks.
BULL28|Right here, that's pretty substi fall, but actually, you know Netflix is up strong for the year in 2015, so it wouldn't be surprising to see it give up some ground.
NEUT29|At some point before the end of the year.
NEUT30|Alright, that's Netflix.
BEAR31|We're bearish on it.
BULL32|Hopefully you guys can make some money down the road, that's it.
BULL33|"Have a great day and I'll see you guys next time."""
