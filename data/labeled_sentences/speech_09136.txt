NEUT0|"""And Julia, you Speaking of politics, you're taking a look at Jeff Gunlock's comments prediction about the election."
NEUT1|Yeah, so Jeffrey gunlock.
NEUT2|He always does these web casts and Julie people have been asking him based on every single one.
NEUT3|What's your base case for the election?
NEUT4|Go back to January of 2016 before the Republican primaries concluded and he said, look, I think Donald Trump is going to win.
NEUT5|And he's very comfortable debt.
BULL6|He also reiterated that that May that he would win and look he did so on the call last night.
NEUT7|He got this question and he said that he would quote bet against.
NEUT8|Former Vice President Joe Biden defeating Donald Trump.
NEUT9|He said his base case is that Donald Trump will actually win reelection.
NEUT10|He specifically pointed to the polls.
BEAR11|He called the polls very, very squishy.
NEUT12|He said that he even came across some data.
NEUT13|I could not find this data, but he said he read something where 2/3 of Conservatives or moderate Conservatives have admitted to lying about their support for President Trump or by either directly or by not admitting it.
NEUT14|He did also weigh in on the vice presidential pick Senator Kamala Harris.
NEUT15|He said he didn't think she was a quote good pick.
NEUT16|He didn't have too much to really say there.
BEAR17|But again, I think it's interesting because it's certainly kind of going against the consensus when you look at the polls.
NEUT18|When you look at the models that are coming out 538, for example, put out there's today.
NEUT19|It looks like based on the polls that Biden is the clear front runner at this point.
NEUT20|But Jeffrey Gunlock, someone who's known for bold predictions and people talking with an old predictions.
NEUT21|But he didn't just say that Kamala Harris wasn't a good pic.
NEUT22|He called her.
NEUT23|A little too dominant and Patrick Matic yes.
NEUT24|And then he didn't have anything further to add to that I I would like to clarify or hear more about what do you mean by that, but he kind of cut it off after that.
NEUT25|You know, I think it's pretty clear what he means by that.
BEAR26|Hey guys, understand I think unlock is wrong about this.
NEUT27|I just looked up some of his predictions.
NEUT28|He has been wrong.
NEUT29|He's not always right.
NEUT30|I think he's wrong about hey investors, sack Guzman?
