NEUT0|"""Everyone welcome to trade a stock.com."
NEUT1|This is an update on the $80,000 Alibaba trade that I did.
NEUT2|As you can see from the Last Post, I bought her right was breaking out here.
NEUT3|You can see that over the last couple months is former Nice Cup with a little handle.
NEUT4|Here.
BULL5|Had resistance here, here, here.
BULL6|Bunch of resistance, bunch of resistance finally broke out of that first stage of resistance on huge volume.
NEUT7|I think I bought around this level around like 186.
NEUT8|I'm I was growing up.
NEUT9|I said that I will get 200 by the end of the year.
NEUT10|An sure enough it did so actually at 201 eighty 9 so right now what I'm doing.
NEUT11|I'm just basically day trading this so it looks like it's going to start having a little bouncy pattern until it goes up higher so might as well just sell up here by when it comes down.
NEUT12|So you here, but one of these days is going to shoot shoot probably took 2 * 225.
NEUT13|Probably next year, but for the time being you probably just started day trading this for swing.
BULL14|Trading this as it can be, but yeah, so this is like a very successful trade.
NEUT15|This is one of my favorite chart patterns.
BULL16|Cup handle taking our resistance, huge volume.
BULL17|"I think this goes much higher, so congratulations everyone that got into this talk and hopefully we make more money off this as well."""
