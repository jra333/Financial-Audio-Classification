NEUT0|"""Speak to as we've seen these names emerge."
NEUT1|Whether it's a Janet Yellen or Tony Blinken, we can go.
NEUT2|We can go down the list, but how do you look at how Biden is putting together this group?
NEUT3|And in particular, you've covered business for a long time.
NEUT4|How you think the business community is going to think about this group of individuals.
NEUT5|The business community is still waiting, right?
NEUT6|They still want to know who their liaison going to be.
NEUT7|This is a problem in the Obama administration on who would actually speak not just to Wall Street to pick order for corporate America by administration can still solve for that, right?
NEUT8|And they just haven't gotten there, so I think there's some waiting in the business community in general.
NEUT9|When you look at those names up there, what you see of all of them is a comfort level that they have with the president elect, and more importantly, with the President elect has with them.
NEUT10|So when we take a big picture of this and just take a step back, one.
NEUT11|It's clear they don't want any confirmation fight.
NEUT12|That's one thing they're trying to avoid.
NEUT13|You know, be you have to be comfortable with the Vice president to be familiar with them.
NEUT14|I mean, Tony Blinken, you see there's so close to the president or the president elected by his side for almost 20 years.
NEUT15|And then I think one thing that is isn't quite captured out there in the commentary is the sense of dread inside by the senior circle about the challenges they're going to face.
NEUT16|And those are known challenges, and I don't want to do a full Rumsfeld here, but those are known challenges and unknowns.
NEUT17|And when you look at the Yellen appointment, she is such A and if she's confirmed right, let's put that **** out there.
NEUT18|She's such a steady crisis firefighter that should anything happen, whether that's an international debt crisis, whether or not some state that you and I aren't even thinking about defaults.
NEUT19|Whatever is down the line, they think they want someone with Yellen's stature, gravitas, and pure technical skills to fight it.
NEUT20|And you can be optimistic about that.
NEUT21|But you could also be pessimistic and say, oh, what is the Biden?
NEUT22|Administration see around the corner and they're clearly preparing for the worst.
NEUT23|Well, let me ask you about a wild card in terms of thinking about through economic crises.
NEUT24|What do you think, Vice President Biden, President elect Biden?
NEUT25|I should say now is thinking in terms of the new chair?
NEUT26|Or maybe the same chair for the Federal Reserve position?
NEUT27|Does Jay Powell keep his job?
NEUT28|Depends what the world looks like.
NEUT29|I would.
NEUT30|I mean, I hate to give you such a hedge dancer.
BULL31|You know, in General Jay Powell gets high marks from Democrats around town as well as well as Republicans away.
BEAR32|Most of the criticism against him has been leveled by the president he serves who wanted to move faster on interest rates?
BULL33|You know, if you think that the Biden administration is going to basically improve upon Obama's 09 response, it was a great question.
NEUT34|And 09 whether or not you keep earning an at the time markets were pretty pretty pretty choppy.
BEAR35|And there was concern that changing the Fed chair at that point would disrupt them or upset them even more.
NEUT36|So you know, by Obama had to go to Larry Summers and say, Larry, I know I told you the deal was come in and be NEC chair and then I'll give you fed.
NEUT37|But we're going to keep her nanki there and that decision was made.
NEUT38|I think in August of 09 in Martha's Vineyard they did it when things were quiet.
BEAR39|So the world looks really disruptive and there's a some major crisis out there that were either can anticipate or can't.
BULL40|That improves Jay Powell's chances of keeping the job at the same time one of the one of the potential reasons why you didn't go for with Lael Brainard for Treasury as you keep her in your pocket for the chair when that chair position comes up, the term expires at 2022.
NEUT41|So you do it in the summer of 2021.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
