BEAR3|Kraft Heinz has been in a negative overall pattern here with this stairstep downward trend here with lower cycle highs and lower cycle lows throughout this whole.
NEUT4|Process here note what happened after that though is that we went into this long basing.
NEUT5|An this basing.
NEUT6|Has actually formed this beautiful inverted head and shoulders with the left shoulder.
NEUT7|Here the head and then the right shoulder.
NEUT8|And we have now actually broken through the neckline of that inverted head and shoulders.
NEUT9|What does that all mean?
BULL10|It means that the odds favor higher prices here in Kraft Heinz.
NEUT11|On the upside, the measured move of this inverted head and shoulders comes in at around $52 or so.
NEUT12|And that's with Kraft Heinz trading 3884.
