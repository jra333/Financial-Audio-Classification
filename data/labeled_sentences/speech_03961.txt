NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, welcome back to case studies with Engineering Robo today we're gonna be talking about Netflix and we're going to be starting from October 2012 to March 2014."
NEUT1|So let's go and see what happened in this market during that year.
NEUT2|So over here as you guys can see on October and November 2012, there is two different by signals from engineering Global which is by two and moon.
NEUT3|1 1/2 year later on March 2014, engineering above gives you to hell and sell 2 signal at the same time.
NEUT4|But during that time the market goes up so much.
NEUT5|Do you wonder how much money people made in here?
NEUT6|Listen up.
NEUT7|So let's say that you wanted to listen engineering robust by signal and you wanted to buy from here from $1000.
NEUT8|When you come back on March 2014, you listen engineering about cell signals and you sell it.
NEUT9|You are going to have $6500 in 1 1/2 year.
NEUT10|Or if you wanted to buy from $100 one and a half year 1 1/2 year later when you come back on March 2014 and you sell it, you are going to have $650.
NEUT11|Sounds amazing, right?
NEUT12|I know.
