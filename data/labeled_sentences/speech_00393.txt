NEUT0|"""Hey folks, welcome to in the money stocks dot Coms, live trading action video."
NEUT1|My name is Gareth Soloway, chief market strategist.
NEUT2|Here today's date is Wednesday, November 16th, 2016.
NEUT3|Take a look at this chart folks.
BULL4|This is a trade that I think is a high reward.
NEUT5|Low risk trade.
BEAR6|Take a look at Alcoa symbol AA and very Simply put, this stock has just risen right up here and gone into a gap.
NEUT7|Fill and look at the move.
BULL8|It adds some.
NEUT9|Basically 20 bucks all the way up right to here and look at the gap that is filling this huge gap right here where I want you to do is just take a trend line right there at that gap, fill and look at that level.
NEUT10|So what this tells me is you're going to retrace.
BEAR11|Pull back on this play and essentially you're going to see a pullback most likely right to this area.
NEUT12|So again you can see right here.
NEUT13|This is where the pivot point point for the gap down was so right here what I want you to do is basically slap a trend line right there and that is your target on a pullback.
NEUT14|This should occur within the next week to two weeks.
NEUT15|And again it is a simple trade shorting out color here at 3152.
NEUT16|A drop point of a target at 27.
BULL17|So basically you're looking at four and a half dollar gain here.
BULL18|That is basically 15% really nice profit there.
NEUT19|And basically it should pay in about 2 weeks or less.
NEUT20|Actually so beautiful.
BULL21|Beautiful chart set up here.
NEUT22|I love charts that get parabolic.
NEUT23|A couple other names that are parabolic.
NEUT24|Obviously the iwm's insane right?
BEAR25|Absolutely insanity here.
NEUT26|What's kind of cool about the IWM you can ignore these other trend lines these are from.
NEUT27|Past analysis, but if you zoom out on the chart and take a look at this gas double top right here, just put a trendline in right there.
BULL28|You're actually right there at that double top, so that's kind of a cool little thing about the IWM which is the Russell and obviously with Trump's election, small caps have done very very well.
BEAR29|Although I have to say I think their pricing in pretty much everything at this point in time and I would start to expect a pullback on them as well.
NEUT30|Listen bottom line is anytime a chart does this type of move, especially in index like the IWM, it's.
NEUT31|Not sustainable.
NEUT32|It's gotta consolidate.
NEUT33|It's going to take a little bit of a breather.
NEUT34|It's gotta have small pullbacks so as investors and traders, that's all we're looking for.
NEUT35|So for instance, when I'm looking for here on IWM is just a very short term.
NEUT36|Pullback right here.
BULL37|Former pivot highs right here.
BEAR38|So you're looking at basically pull back to 124 which is about a $6 pullback from the highs today and that should happen literally in the next week or two as well.
NEUT39|So you know these type of things are just fantastic trading opportunities.
NEUT40|There are low risk high reward traits you get in.
NEUT41|You get out your back in cash, which is where you really want to be.
NEUT42|For the most part, right?
NEUT43|Think about it when you're invested in the market fully and you're holding overnight every single night of the year, there's always a risk you wake up to some catastrophic event when you're in and out, and you're in the market for a couple weeks and you're back in cash and then you're back in for a few days and you're back in cash.
NEUT44|You're limiting your exposure to the market as long as it's sitting in cash in your account.
NEUT45|Nothing is going to happen to it, but as soon as you put it in the market, there is a little bit of risk that comes on board because of that.
NEUT46|So anyways, just wanted to pass these little observations along to you.
NEUT47|Fantastic stuff.
BULL48|Have a great afternoon.
BULL49|Great evening.
NEUT50|Come join us in the money stocks come take a look at our track record folks.
NEUT51|Third party verified track record.
NEUT52|You can see the trades for this year in the Research Center.
BULL53|It is a stellar stellar year and it will be continuing because the volatility is back.
NEUT54|Baby, enjoy.
NEUT55|"Take care."""
