BULL0|"""Elephants are going to challenge thanks for watching this video."
NEUT1|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about Lippo Sinai, NC now.
NEUT2|The stop is moving on the upside and this has crossed an important moving average.
NEUT3|That's why it falls under a category of.
NEUT4|An uptrend going forward and that's what we're going to discuss over here.
NEUT5|But first we need to look at.
BULL6|To support levels.
NEUT7|Not too important.
NEUT8|Support levels first will be at 1.28 an your last support will be at 1.18.
NEUT9|Now, having said that.
NEUT10|OK, if it should not go below 1.18, that's the bottom line now.
NEUT11|If it continues to hold at or above 1.28, in that case the long term targets in the upcoming weeks and months that we're probably going to see.
NEUT12|Are something like these.
NEUT13|OK, so your first target.
NEUT14|Will be at 2.45.
NEUT15|Then you will have your next target at 3.5.
NEUT16|OK. No.
NEUT17|You know we have on the upside.
NEUT18|On the upside.
NEUT19|You have.
NEUT20|5.54 and you have 6.13, so these are the four targets or four individual targets that we're looking at.
BULL21|If first the stock sustained above 1.28 second.
NEUT22|Once it crossed the first residence orbit, first target of 2.45, then we have.
NEUT23|3.5 and one is 3.5 get crossed.
NEUT24|We have two consecutive targets, a 5.54 and 6.13 in the weeks as well as in the months to come and we will re analyze the chart again accordingly.
NEUT25|So this is the end of the video.
