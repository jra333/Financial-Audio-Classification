NEUT0|"""So what is up YouTube today?"
NEUT1|We're going to be talking about if Facebook stock is a buy or not?
NEUT2|The Facebook developed products that enable people to connect and share with friends and family through mobile devices, personal computers, virtual reality headsets and in home devices worldwide.
BEAR3|Now we're going to look at be looking at some numbers so Facebook is on the lower end of its 52 week range at about $154.00.
NEUT4|Its market cap is $446 billion and his P ratio is 24.
NEUT5|That is relatively high for attacks dog, but because of its growth you cannot argue as stocks like Amazon and Netflix have a lot higher P ratios.
NEUT6|Now let's talk about.
NEUT7|So as we can see, the top 10 apps by from 2010 to 2019.
NEUT8|Worldwide, the top four are owned by Facebook and the next competitor, Snapchat, which is a lot smaller than Facebook.
NEUT9|So they basically dominate social media.
NEUT10|And as we can see, Facebook has about 2.2 billion users and this is sorted from country to country.
NEUT11|So it's their users all over the world.
NEUT12|Now we're going to be talking about the growth so.
NEUT13|We could see a straight line or it's relatively close to a straight line and this is how fast faces been growing.
NEUT14|In 2017, Facebook was about 2 billion users and now it's at two and a half million users.
BULL15|This is a 25% growth in two years.
NEUT16|Now let's talk about revenue per user.
NEUT17|When US it was $26.26 for the quarter, which is 3 months.
NEUT18|For Europe, the average revenue per user was around $9, and in Asia is around $3.
NEUT19|For this rule, the average revenue for the quarter was around $2.00.
NEUT20|So now let's look at the financials.
NEUT21|In 2016, it reported $26 billion in 2019, as reported $72 billion.
BULL22|So you can see the huge growth in three years.
NEUT23|I have bought some Facebook shares in within the past couple of days.
NEUT24|I've owned it before, but these are my games just for the past four days.
NEUT25|So what are my final thoughts about Facebook?
NEUT26|While Facebook is a buy if it continues to stay at these prices and I'll continue buying until it goes around 160 or $170, it may even reach lower.
BEAR27|And now as of the coronavirus situation, I don't Facebook more people will be using Facebook, but advertiser will be paying less.
BEAR28|So revenue might be stable or they might drop a little, but there won't be.
BEAR29|Hit as hard as other tech stocks like Apple or Facebook or Apple or Amazon or Netflix.
NEUT30|Actually not Netflix, Apple or Amazon or Microsoft now before I end the video, I translate, stay safe and stay hygienic.
BULL31|"Thank you."""
