NEUT0|"""Well, we really just started The Motley Fool as a newsletter for our parents friends."
BEAR1|They were the only ones willing to pay.
BEAR2|Is $48.00 a year for our advice and I think they just kind of felt sorry for us from the get go.
NEUT3|We've always loved the stock market we had talked about the stock market and we started realizing our parents friends don't know that much about the stock market and so we thought we had a voice by picking a foolish name.
NEUT4|A business grew out of that, but it kind of celebrates a foolish life.
NEUT5|Which is you're not really with Wall Street.
NEUT6|We're more Main Street, not Wall Street.
NEUT7|We take our work seriously, but we don't take ourselves too seriously, and so the name, just it fit.
NEUT8|I'm reading from your energy and enthusiasm.
NEUT9|This is still as fun today or more fun than it ever has been.
NEUT10|After 25 years it is more fun today than it ever has been.
NEUT11|And that's the way we think you should be with your money when you're investing in great companies, right?
NEUT12|You should love what the company does.
NEUT13|You should see something of yourself in it.
NEUT14|You should be patient when your team has a losing streak you shouldn't sell.
NEUT15|You should basically be making a lifetime of it.
NEUT16|As a fan.
NEUT17|And so the greatest friend to us is the power of compound.
NEUT18|It returns.
NEUT19|The math is so beautiful.
BULL20|The stock market on average returns about 10% annualized.
NEUT21|I don't know of anything else that does that, and so if you just let that 10% keep compounding, you start to double your money every seven years.
NEUT22|So there's just mass ignorance about how to make your money work for you.
NEUT23|What companies do you admire?
NEUT24|Great, let's buy those companies in our portfolios.
NEUT25|Let's not worry about what the market is going to do tomorrow.
NEUT26|Let's not worry about people telling you it's going to crash next year.
NEUT27|Those kinds of things.
NEUT28|About being an investor of the rest of your life and let's start doing it the real way.
NEUT29|The way that works.
NEUT30|A lot of people like fantasy football.
NEUT31|I like fantasy stock ball.
NEUT32|I think that we should have the same fund that people have with watching sports with our stocks.
NEUT33|I'm really just a gamer who happens to invest.
NEUT34|If you're a gamer, this is like the greatest game of all is asking what's going to beat the market, what's going to be the next Apple?
NEUT35|That's one thing we do every day at The Motley Fool.
NEUT36|What makes us unique is this species is we trade.
NEUT37|We trade goods.
NEUT38|We trade ideas, we trade experiences.
NEUT39|We trade across cultures from the dawn of humanity we started to rise out of the swamps with many other species were because we traded and more than anything we traded ideas.
NEUT40|And that's the story of capitalism.
NEUT41|When we work together.
NEUT42|When you do something, you're really good at and I do something I'm really good at and we buy from each other.
NEUT43|You have people doing what they love and do best, and then we should start corporations together and be invested together.
NEUT44|And then watch our stocks triple or go up 300 times in value.
NEUT45|Like Amazon.com, poverty doesn't need to be explained really.
NEUT46|What needs to be explained is our wealth or prosperity.
NEUT47|Where did that come from and how do we?
NEUT48|How do we get more of that?
NEUT49|"How we generate more than for everybody globally?"""
