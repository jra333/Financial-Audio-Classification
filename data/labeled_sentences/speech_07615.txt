NEUT0|"""Good morning, I'm Sarah Pruitt from Milwaukee, WI Ann."
BEAR1|I wondered if you feel that the speed with which information is available and disseminated today has affected your business buying decision process and do you believe that speed has caused you to miss opportunities?
NEUT2|Question about sees expanding.
NEUT3|No, there's the speed of information today.
NEUT4|Affect our decision making process.
NEUT5|Now we I would say that.
NEUT6|We perform about like we were doing 30 or 40 years ago.
NEUT7|I mean we we read we read Daniel, it isn't.
NEUT8|It isn't the speed of information really doesn't make any difference to us.
NEUT9|It it.
NEUT10|It's the processing.
NEUT11|And finally coming to.
NEUT12|To some judgment that actually has some utility, that is that it's it's a judgment about the price of a business or part of a business of security.
NEUT13|Versus what it's essentially worth and.
NEUT14|Anne.
NEUT15|None of that.
NEUT16|Involves anything to do really with with with quick information.
NEUT17|It involves getting good information, but usually that.
NEUT18|That it's not.
NEUT19|We're not looking for needles in haystacks or anything of the sort.
NEUT20|You know.
NEUT21|We like haystacks, not needles.
NEUT22|Basically, Anan, ANAN and we wanted to shout at us.
NEUT23|An I would say that.
NEUT24|That well, virtually everything we've done has been reading public reports an an then maybe.
NEUT25|Asking questions around ascertain trade positions or product strengths or something of that sort.
NEUT26|But we never have to.
NEUT27|We can make decisions very fast when we get called on a business or or we can.
NEUT28|We can make up our mind whether we're interested in two or three minutes.
NEUT29|I mean that that takes no time.
NEUT30|We may have to do a little checking on a few things subsequently.
NEUT31|But we don't need to get.
NEUT32|I can't think of anything where we where we really need lots of price tag or things like that extremely fast to make any any decisions.
NEUT33|We've got good management information systems and our operating businesses, but that's that's just another.
NEUT34|You know, it's a question of keeping inventories where they should be in all of that sort of thing.
NEUT35|I don't think they invest.
NEUT36|I think you could.
NEUT37|Be in some place where the males were delayed three weeks.
BEAR38|And and the quotations were delayed three weeks.
BULL39|"And I think you can do just fine, and investing."""
