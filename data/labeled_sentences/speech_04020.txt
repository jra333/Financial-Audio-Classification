NEUT0|"""Traders, friends, investors, peeps."
NEUT1|What is going on?
NEUT2|We are back in a quick one so we gotta talk about highly on baby.
NEUT3|The loose streak is finally over.
NEUT4|I don't know how I missed this the other day, boom.
NEUT5|What do we talk about in the last video we said they need something with substance.
NEUT6|They need a deal.
NEUT7|They need a partnership, a contract.
BULL8|And now that they've announced this, we've finally started to run up a bit.
NEUT9|So they don't really call out any numbers, projected orders or anything like that.
NEUT10|They say that they have 19 of these think this is clean natural gas trucks in their fleet of 175 trucks total and two of those are highly on.
NEUT11|So you know we need to get some numbers but just goes to show you just the mere fact that another company is saying that, hey, we're working with highly on.
NEUT12|We're using their products and that's all it took.
NEUT13|Man, that's all it took.
NEUT14|Now.
NEUT15|Let's talk about some other stuff and things.
NEUT16|The shorts baby.
BULL17|The shorts are finally under control.
NEUT18|These are the wrong pictures.
NEUT19|Or they're starting to get under control.
NEUT20|I wish I had this over, but these all came in at the same exact second kind of sketchy, but then it happened again a couple seconds later.
NEUT21|Obviously there's a mixed number in here, but this entire page, red cell order all at the same exact 2nd, and you know, right?
NEUT22|As it's starting to take off again, mind you and we're not overbought anymore.
NEUT23|You know?
NEUT24|We're not overbaugh?
NEUT25|We're leaving that zone so can't really argue that I don't know.
NEUT26|This could be high frequency trading, you know like a.
BEAR27|A big Robin Hood order coming in and getting dropped all at once.
NEUT28|I'm not sure.
BEAR29|All I know is that we've seen sketchy stuff in the past and we've speculated that, you know, there's been kind of shorting and lots of manipulation going on, you know, but we said, you know, as new investors come into this thing, short sellers will lose their power because it's just too risky.
NEUT30|You know to keep shorting a stock that's starting to run up and gain momentum.
NEUT31|And in this video here, when was this on the 20th?
NEUT32|They had 7000 followers.
BULL33|Hi Leon's 11 K almost 12 K. They've pretty much doubled their followers on Twitter in the course of a little less than 1/2 about 2 1/2 weeks, they've doubled their following on Twitter.
NEUT34|All right.
BULL35|Good things are coming for the peeps.
BULL36|All right, we're on track again.
NEUT37|The shorts are not out of control anymore.
NEUT38|They're still happening, or at least speculated.
NEUT39|Let me know the down there which you think.
NEUT40|But whether that's here nor there this is happening.
BULL41|We got some good catalyst building sub Johnny Bravo that guys funny as ****.
NEUT42|But yeah lots of good stuff going on.
NEUT43|Just wanted to kind of touch on why we're removing today.
NEUT44|If you didn't know and my outlook moving forward.
NEUT45|I updated some different points of interest here.
NEUT46|Let's see if we can ride this baby out of the pit now like the thing do the stuff.
NEUT47|Follow me on the stuff if you want to see stuff more often.
BULL48|Hope you all enjoyed.
NEUT49|Of course I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT50|This is not financial advice, but yes.
NEUT51|"Catching the next one."""
