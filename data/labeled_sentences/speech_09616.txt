NEUT0|"""We've talked about drop box in the past."
BULL1|Paul, let's look at it one more time, 8.3 billion hundred and five PX profit margin 7% after #3 is revenue growth.
NEUT2|Wherever you go the less five years OK 6038 forty 41.11 point 41.66 it's pretty good and profitable.
NEUT3|Last few years 8 making money all day.
BEAR4|OK well the profits going up all right it's a check mark they lose their losing less money so.
NEUT5|Number of shares outstanding as it's gone, how about assets over liabilities?
NEUT6|Current assets over current liabilities.
BEAR7|1.33 Versus 1.02 slash $3 million more than the free cash flow.
BULL8|Who's ready for average free cash over the last five years of last four years have been or 1,000,000 have a lot of growth potential.
NEUT9|I'm seeing $6 billion as a value.
NEUT10|Listen over price, quote unquote.
BEAR11|You can understand where their stabilization is like, how much their free cash flow is being eaten up.
BULL12|The cash operations from growing.
NEUT13|This actually might not be a bad deal.
BEAR14|I thought this would be terrible.
NEUT15|It might not be awful.
NEUT16|You gotta understand.
NEUT17|How much of their expenses are advertising to grow versus stabilize and what's their strategy long term that she might not be a terrible option on a company.
NEUT18|If you believe the growth is going to be very large, the question is how big is their market?
NEUT19|And they become a five $10 billion revenue company there at 1.8 right now and their gross margin is insanely high and it was spending a lot of money growing on advertising.
NEUT20|You gotta understand that by seeing what it would be stabilized, they're always going to have advertising costs, and maybe they're aggressively spending money.
NEUT21|They actually just turned a profit this year in the trailing 12 months.
BULL22|That's good.
NEUT23|Let's see how many quarters of profit.
NEUT24|I mean, look at that 3/4 in a row profit.
BULL25|It's pretty solid guys, do that $100 million.
BEAR26|I mean, it's still freaking high.
BEAR27|PE 120,000,000 is still a high PE, but the free cash flow number looks pretty solid, so maybe I don't know why the pee in the free cash flow aren't lining up.
NEUT28|"That's the interesting part."""
