NEUT13|Not providing Q4 guidance at this time.
NEUT14|Guys back to you.
BULL15|Yeah nice 5% move higher for Apple after hours 4 for one stock split.
BULL16|Stephanie, I'm sorry to cut you off before, why don't we give you the first word here with 11% revenue growth, almost 20% looks like 18% earnings growth to new June quarter records.
NEUT17|What do you make of that?
BULL18|I mean well, and I also think the iPhone sales were, I mean, the units are much better than expected, right?
NEUT19|I mean 26.4 versus 22.4 services.
NEUT20|And I was saying I thought I was.
NEUT21|I was looking for about 12 and a half 13% growth.
BULL22|We got 15% growth in that.
BULL23|Has to be because the App Store the it's really accelerated throughout the quarter.
BULL24|We thought that would be up about 3032%.
BULL25|That looks like it's a little bit higher, so I think this is a fabulous report across the board.
NEUT26|It trades at 30 times earnings.
BULL27|It's up 64% since March, so the expectations were high.
NEUT28|But these are fabulous numbers.
NEUT29|Now we just wait for the 5G.
NEUT30|Yeah, so Josh Lipton.
NEUT31|Let's get back to you.
NEUT32|Have any more color that you can give us on this report?
NEUT33|Yeah, couple of some color.
NEUT34|I would give you guys first of all on the iPhone we talked about the iPhone it cooked telling me the iPhone 11 was his top seller during the quarter.
NEUT35|It's been that way since the iPhone actually launched.
NEUT36|We also did talk about China two.
NEUT37|We mentioned this.
BULL38|They did grow 2% in real dollars.
NEUT39|Cook saying but on a constant currency basis they actually were 6%.
BULL40|So we definitely saw China sort of come back into a big increase.
NEUT41|I asked Cook about China, what's interesting there guys remember?
NEUT42|China has about 40 Apple Stores, unlike here they open some stores that they had to reclose them fairly quickly because of those COVID-19 spikes, they did not have to do that in China.
NEUT43|I asked whether that made a difference and he said that didn't make a difference in the quarter guys.
BULL44|Josh, thanks so much for that.
NEUT45|Let's get to Dan Ives.
BEAR46|Dan looks like on the surface they've smashed it across pretty much every line.
NEUT47|What do you make of it?
BEAR48|Yeah, this is a complete blowout.
NEUT49|I mean even best case this is beyond in terms of the iPhone number.
BULL50|The China growth, which is key to the stock moving phone number 60 to 70 million iPhones in the window of Upper great opportunity for China.
NEUT51|And then you look at the margin profile.
NEUT52|You put this all together.
NEUT53|This is a stock.
NEUT54|I think.
NEUT55|Next step is 425 four fifty we workout next three to six months into an iPhone 12 product cycle.
NEUT56|You know just this is a test one like number and now phase two comes for Apple in terms of iPhone.
NEUT57|"12"""
