BULL0|"""Headline inflation is going to rise steeply, and that's gonna be the case pretty much right across the world."
NEUT1|Mickey influence, of course, is the oil price you know.
NEUT2|Back in April of last year, they're all priced.
BEAR3|The Brent crude oil price was down some 60% year on year in at the end of last year, it was still down around 25%.
NEUT4|By the time we get to April, even if you don't get much further, increases are going to be looking at you and your changes in all price that are well above 100%.
NEUT5|That's going to be a big impulse.
NEUT6|So what I would recommend to people is keep a close eye on.
BEAR7|On core inflation and don't ignore that inflation was also depressed last year and not just in in the euro area.
NEUT8|Also in the UK or Japan, many other countries, by fiscal measures that were taken in response to the covid epidemic.
NEUT9|And as those those initiatives expire, inflation and core inflation as well is going to take up.
NEUT10|But you know, when you look at the longer term with the medium term without a significant acceleration in wage pressures, it's.
NEUT11|Unlikely that inflation is really going to increase, but no inflation has been a big topic in financial markets and breaking new inflation rates and market measures of future inflation have increased, not 2 levels at this stage that I would say are concerning there pretty much in line with the average of the past five years, but we do of course have a much weaker economy, so I think inflation is going to be a topic over the next few months, and particularly until April May when the headline numbers are gonna rise quite like we've had some pretty big surprises at the beginning of the year in the euro area.
NEUT12|"In Germany in particular."""
