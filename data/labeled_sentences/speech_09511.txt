BEAR0|"""And I wonder if you think the Apple splits will be more consequential down the road than we currently think."
NEUT1|I mean, if you're buying the QS trying to ride the tailwind of Mega Cap tech, at least on a price waiting basis, does that become less powerful?
NEUT2|Or maybe you don't believe that these companies will split the way Apple's announced.
NEUT3|We don't know that other companies will follow apples lead, you know, years ago when you bought a stock, their worst commissions you were paying.
NEUT4|So if you were buying 10 shares and the commissions were $100, it could be significant.
NEUT5|Nowadays, Schwab, Fidelity or not charging commissions.
NEUT6|So the fact that you're buying two shares or 10 shares or 100 shares really shouldn't make a difference.
NEUT7|We think in the Apple case, psychologically people will all of a sudden look at Apple at $100 a share and get excited and probably bid it up a little bit more.
NEUT8|So we think in that case it probably helps that stock for a little bit, but longer term it's going to be fundamentals how their earnings are doing, how their new iPhones are coming out.
NEUT9|David in listening to make the argument value versus growth.
NEUT10|I feel as though you could have made that same argument six months ago, even six years ago, and you wouldn't necessarily have been right.
NEUT11|I applaud you for sticking to your discipline in terms of PE multiples, but I just wonder, are you just not in the proper place in time anymore as an investor?
BULL12|But we're actually doing OK, but and we do own Microsoft and Apple and Falkum that we bought a really good price.
BULL13|So we're enjoying those moves.
NEUT14|But there's a study that Bloomberg does where they look at the capitalization of the S&P 500 growth versus value.
NEUT15|And if you look at that, we're now 4 standard deviations extreme.
NEUT16|The last time we were this extreme was 1999.
NEUT17|There were two standard deviations, extreme and I will tell you in 1999 we were getting calls from friends from clients.
BEAR18|They were basically saying, you know you've lost your edge.
NEUT19|You don't really know what's happening with the village idiot and subsequently over the next decade the NASDAQ was basically flat to down and the broader market was up about 6 or 7% a year.
NEUT20|So enormous differential so you know, it seems to be that the growth stocks can only go higher.
NEUT21|But having done this for 35 plus years, we know when you're paying 70 times earnings, you know something not good is going to happen again.
NEUT22|The caveat is companies like Microsoft.
BULL23|Apple, Facebook, whose businesses are pretty robust.
BULL24|We think we're going to do fine, but we're just less optimistic about where Microsoft stock goes in.
NEUT25|Apple stock goes in the next year or two, rather than what it said in the last year or two.
BULL26|We've had a great ride with them.
NEUT27|We still own them, were holding them.
BULL28|We just think that they're probably going to be OK rather than other areas of the portfolio.
BULL29|"We think we're going to be exceptionally good."""
