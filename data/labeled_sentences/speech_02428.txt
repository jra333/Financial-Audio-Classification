NEUT0|"""What's up guys."
NEUT1|Video information here.
NEUT2|So we have the four minute analysis and yes, I am invested for Disney so we have a price to earnings for the value investor of 13.48.
NEUT3|A forward price earnings of 15.10.
BEAR4|We have the average P in the 20s so both fall below it.
NEUT5|However it is a little annoying to me how it's going forward and it's going upward rather than more down but not a big deal.
NEUT6|It's still a very cheap company to buy into price to book ratio 3 point.
NEUT7|4/4 in price.
NEUT8|The sales you have a 2.82 and both need to be under 5 therefore cheap debt over equity of .33 average under needs to be a .5.
NEUT9|So cheaper than that as well.
BULL10|Moving on to the growth investor we have revenue of 59.5 billion at an annual basis 8.3% year over year growth market cap 170.2 billion.
BULL11|In their recent earnings, which was quarter four revenue rose 12% year over year.
BULL12|Note that is bigger than the current annual to 14.3 billion beat analysts expectations of 13.7 billion, so a .6 B Torah 4% beat.
BULL13|Not huge, but hey, it's 4% studio entertainment revenue 2.15 billion and that is up for the quarter of 50%.
BULL14|Studio Entertainment income 596 million up 173%.
NEUT15|Further information we have Disney go, the streaming video service to compete with Netflix and the Netflix will lose a Marvel, Star Wars, etc.
NEUT16|Whatever else that Disney owns, Netflix will no longer have and Disney will be able to put on their Disney go streaming service to continue to compete and that will be another revenue source for Disney Easilly.
BULL17|Disney can really raise revenue if they can get Star Wars if they can get Star Wars popular with the fans they scared off.
BEAR18|So by that I mean there's a lot of hatred going around.
NEUT19|About Disney and Star Wars, because they just aren't doing it the way that they should be in the movies and stuff, and some of the movies were good, but.
NEUT20|I think this 9th movie, so on so forth.
NEUT21|Once Disney go comes and I feel like as many ways as they have Star Wars going, one of the ways will end up working for almost everybody and I here with JJ Abrams for Movie 9.
BULL22|He's about to combine all the other ones together, so hopefully he can make a good 'cause Movie 7 wasn't that bad, so I'm excited just to continue to see what comes of.
NEUT23|Star Wars and Disney and that was definitely one of the niche reasons I'm in this company because I do believe in Star Wars getting them that revenue in the long term.
NEUT24|Absolutely.
NEUT25|On top of the many other things that they already have going for them, Marvel films continue to break records every time they have a Marvel movie that always brings in great money.
NEUT26|Infinity War broke records.
BULL27|The next one will probably do even better.
NEUT28|They'll just continue to bring out Marvel movies, whether it be next year or the year after that.
NEUT29|If they hold off for two years, Marvel films are always there and can always bring in more and more revenue there, like the Kings of the box office pretty much.
NEUT30|And that is pretty much it.
NEUT31|This was the form and analysis of you enjoyed.
