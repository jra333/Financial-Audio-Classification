NEUT0|"""Let's get to botosani."
NEUT1|Hey Bob.
NEUT2|Yeah, that's about the only weakness Carl.
BEAR3|We have a mercifully flattish open after of confusing and really difficult trading.
BULL4|We remember got quadruple Witching today we're gonna have a lot of volume toward the clothes.
NEUT5|But take a look at the sectors.
NEUT6|And as I said, mercifully kind of on the flattish side.
NEUT7|Nothing really tremendous.
BEAR8|You see, the banks are weak here.
NEUT9|I think that's important here.
NEUT10|Let's just put up some of the banks here and it's Carl said the Fed is not going to extend that SLR rule.
NEUT11|That's that pen, Derek.
NEUT12|Pandemic crisis rule that allowed banks to relax their capital.
BEAR13|Levels, so there's some concern here that the banks might have to apply more capital against their Holdings, baby.
NEUT14|They'll have to sell Treasurys.
NEUT15|Maybe they won't be be able to buy back as much stock.
BEAR16|There's a lot of vague concerns about this, but you can see some nominal weakness of the bigger issue is just a confusion this week.
NEUT17|I mean, it's just been head spinning to try to figure out what the trends are this week.
NEUT18|So remember, the main narrative was pretty simple.
NEUT19|Starting this week, inflation replaced Covid as the primary market risk.
BULL20|Everyone came into the week saying, thank Goodness Cove is behind us.
NEUT21|Now we have to deal with inflation.
BEAR22|And yet yesterday we got smacked in the face reminded with these European lockdowns in Paris and in other parts of Europe that covid's not gone away that their variants that may be very difficult in the future and that created other problems in energy stocks that have been rallying at the same time.
NEUT23|We've seen these value stocks.
NEUT24|Suddenly they become momentum stocks.
NEUT25|The question is, does that keep up or not or do we go back to growth?
NEUT26|Nobody quite has a lot of conviction on many things except the idea that rates are moving up.
NEUT27|So if you just look the good news is big cap tech stocks.
BEAR28|Haven't been damaged too much this week.
BEAR29|By and large, the declines have been fairly modest here.
BEAR30|You see three 4% declines and even Apple is just for actually on the downside.
NEUT31|Right now.
NEUT32|The other sectors, the thematic tech ETF's that everybody loves those clean energy stocks and the gaming stocks, the cloud computing stuff and Kathy Woods in Ark innovation.
NEUT33|He put that up.
BEAR34|They just hit been hit a lot more.
BEAR35|So Ark innovation was down about 5%.
BEAR36|If you put up that next one you see those declines are more notable and that may be an issue, but these people tend to.
NEUT37|Kicked in and out very quickly 'cause they can with the ETF's.
NEUT38|The value stocks have become momentum stock.
BEAR39|No energy stocks got hit badly yesterday, but by and large a lot of those mid level consumer needs that the McDonald's and the MERCS and the world pools of the world put that up there.
BULL40|They were hit and had rebounded nicely.
BULL41|They held up well this week.
BULL42|She's having a fairly good week so in the last month these value stocks have become momentum names.
NEUT43|The reopening trade by and large is continuing with the exception of energy so.
BULL44|Airlines and home builders and autos are doing pretty well on the week.
NEUT45|If you take a look at that, I think the main thing here it's put that final full screen is that everything is speeding up a little bit.
BEAR46|Carl, there's this meant hyper acceleration in trading.
NEUT47|It's not the speed of trading that's changed, it's that the retail traders seem to have access to a lot more data and a result.
NEUT48|The trading activity is much higher than it was even a year ago, and you know, there's a joke going around.
NEUT49|Carl that that eventually what's happening here is my artificial intelligence trading mechanism.
NEUT50|Is going to interact with your artificial trading intelligence mechanism in the future, and they're all going to be really smart.
BULL51|Maybe Carl it's not going to be Renaissance capital smart, maybe not James Simons smart, but my AI trading device is going to get darn good and they're getting a lot better and traders have access to more information and as result their trading Moran is a feeling that trading is just speeding up.
NEUT52|That's one thing that I hear from the trading desks all the time.
NEUT53|Very hard to get your head around it, but change is happening really fast.
NEUT54|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT55|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
