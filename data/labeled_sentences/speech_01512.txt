NEUT0|"""Hey guys I wanna give you guys an update on Icon or Icx."
NEUT1|It's been awhile since I didn't update on this coin and seems like light years with the way things have changed so.
BEAR2|Last time I did a video we were above this support line here at $1.61 and we did break below it.
BEAR3|We have been below it.
BEAR4|We broke below it.
BULL5|Yes, two days ago we stayed below it yesterday and today we whipped back up to it, but we're still below it.
BEAR6|I'm going to turn this line into resistance now because we're just having too much trouble getting back above it for it to be considered support an at this point.
NEUT7|It's a little bit scary because.
NEUT8|We are technically just in open air right now, and what I mean by open areas where between two moving averages were between the 20 day and the 50 day moving average, there's nothing here this can last a close above the 20 day moving average and then hopefully we could get some momentum to the upside.
NEUT9|But as of right now.
NEUT10|This is just it's.
NEUT11|It's a little scary.
BEAR12|It's a little bit of a scary environment to be in.
BEAR13|We're definitely nowhere near to returning to our all time highs.
NEUT14|Today or tomorrow.
NEUT15|Or anywhere that I could foresee an I'm actually going to draw.
NEUT16|A trend line.
NEUT17|Straight down.
BULL18|So that's the trend line we're facing and our trend line has been consistent since.
BEAR19|February 19th we've been going against this trend line.
BEAR20|Until we close a daily candle on top of this trendline and every day that passes, this trendline becomes lower and lower, which, on a positive note, means that there's more of a chance of closing above it.
BEAR21|But until we close above this trendline, I'm just seeing more downside for this coin.
NEUT22|The next point of support that I see is the 50 day moving average and that is at $1.22 alright, so hopefully hopefully we just get a quick quick down to it instead of closing down there, but that is really the next point of support.
NEUT23|After that.
BEAR24|The next point of support is down at $0.90.
NEUT25|I really don't think that will be visiting those levels.
NEUT26|That's a very low low price for.
BULL27|This coin is had a pretty solid run up.
NEUT28|It is about.
NEUT29|It seems like a good price right now for it to be turning around honestly, but it just hasn't yet, so I would expect it soon to turn around.
NEUT30|But the lower it goes.
NEUT31|The lower it goes, the lower goes, the more violent the upturn will be as well.
NEUT32|So but the lower goes, the more of a chance of breaking above it.
BULL33|But like I said, the next point I see at a turnaround at is a dollar $19.20 ish.
