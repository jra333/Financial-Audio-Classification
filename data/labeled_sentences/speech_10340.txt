BULL0|"""Look, a son is definitely worth something."
NEUT1|The goal is to figure out what it is.
NEUT2|What should be the price?
NEUT3|Well, I know that it's too high now at its reference price of 21, the stock was valued at 14 times sales, which seems appropriate for a good but not great cloud play, at least in this cloud logging market.
NEUT4|Great cloud stocks sell for 30 times sales, which believe me is so high but did trust me.
NEUT5|Or this is the way the market is right now.
NEUT6|The thing is, Asana opened in 27.
NEUT7|That level is selling for 18 times sales, tougher to justify then it get boring going out of 28 and change.
NEUT8|That's 19 times sales that puts in the same ballpark is similar companies like Smartsheet or Slack.
NEUT9|Even as these companies are much closer to turning a profit, that should matter.
NEUT10|Now, let's talk about what I use as a way to be able to have my reference price.
NEUT11|OK, this is something I'm going to.
NEUT12|I've introduced and introduced an.
NEUT13|I'm not going to stop until you understand it's called the rule of 40 alright.
NEUT14|What's the rule of 40?
NEUT15|This is our quick it take it, take your take your cell phone and take a picture of this way.
NEUT16|It's quick and dirty way of evaluating software as a service place.
NEUT17|You take the revenue growth.
NEUT18|OK, that's the sales revenue growth.
NEUT19|Then you add the operating margin.
NEUT20|That's the percentage of sales that they keep as earnings before interest in taxes.
NEUT21|If the sum is great as arithmetic people, if the sum is greater than 40, the stock deserves another look.
BEAR22|If it's below 40 bad side last year, San had 86% revenue growth, but a negative 49% operating margin.
NEUT23|What it comes to 37?
NEUT24|Just barely fails the rule of 40 tests, but get this in the first six months of the year.
BEAR25|The revenue growth slowed to 63 operating margin dropped it negative 51.
NEUT26|That gives you a 12.
BEAR27|The worst rule of 40 square in the group.
NEUT28|There are many ways to evaluate these kinds of stocks, but the best apples to apples comparison is this an it flunks this so therefore I don't have to worry about Assad.
BEAR29|It's not right for me.
NEUT30|Cover it for you, but I got this.
NEUT31|This says no bottom line asanas and imperfect cloud play with the stock.
NEUT32|This price for perfection.
NEUT33|I think it's an intriguing industry, but there's too much competition at these levels.
NEUT34|This tells me the darn stock is simply too expensive.
