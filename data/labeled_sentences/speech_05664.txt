BULL0|"""Welcome back, he said."
NEUT1|29th of May 2020.
NEUT2|Friday is a freaking weekend so have a salsa.
BULL3|Great weekend ahead of you.
NEUT4|We were doing decrypt an algorithm to kutum coming in #46 for custom against BBC.
BEAR5|Yeah, we're still in a bad trend.
NEUT6|We've been going down and down and down and down and you know, we've been under the skinny pink line for a very, very long time.
NEUT7|We tried to, you know, go near it but we fail.
NEUT8|We will push down.
BEAR9|We are pulled down.
NEUT10|We went near it, put down again.
NEUT11|Are we going to go close to it?
BEAR12|You know I'm gonna get pulled down again and I got so I don't know what's happening.
NEUT13|There is still no clear reversal chart pattern.
BEAR14|I'm not so sure what's happening to kutum.
BEAR15|There's a bear flag over here Anber Flex off bearish chart patterns which means that potentially we could still have more downside to go for kutum against BTC from the very high here to the very low Q to measure D dropped 96 freaking percent and so yeah I believe that I believe but very likely one day kutum you know probably.
NEUT16|Refund back up.
NEUT17|I tell you it's going to take some time, you know before we station you sort of a recovery.
NEUT18|So usually when things move, I mean when there's a trend reversal from a bear, we have to accumulate for awhile first before we go back up.
NEUT19|There is still no accumulation yet we're still enough battery when you go for accumulation before we can go back up.
NEUT20|So it's going to take some time though.
NEUT21|It's going to take at least several weeks, months, Even so there's nothing much that we can do except to be patient and to wait for the cute.
BULL22|You still do the acting alright, so let's move on to come against USD babyfur net.
NEUT23|Please give this video life enjoyed it.
NEUT24|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about customer comments below.
NEUT25|So begins USD.
NEUT26|It's still very unclear we're not exactly sure what a cute and we also doing.
BULL27|We're kind of rising up a channel though.
NEUT28|Yeah, but you know, normally when you get shot patterns like this it is bearish.
NEUT29|You will resolve back towards the downside.
NEUT30|More likely than not.
NEUT31|Of course it could go up, but more likely more like more often than not it should be resolving to Wister.
NEUT32|Downside there are rare occasions during bowl seasons.
NEUT33|Yeah, when you get a rising channel which are supposed to break to visit on site but then you break towards the upside is like what is defying the laws of physics here at.
NEUT34|Only happens during boot season, so Boo season could be here.
NEUT35|It could be close by, but you look at our rush into anything until we are absolutely sure.
NEUT36|Alright, I guess it from technical analysis.
BULL37|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL38|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT39|"I just see you in the next video."""
