NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Shuangcheng chief economist for Greater China and North Asia."
NEUT1|He's with us from Standard Chartered this morning.
BULL2|Good morning to you.
NEUT3|Let me ask you.
BEAR4|Initially, the number on GDP is not far off the expectation.
BEAR5|And yet, as Steve showed, us, the Greater China markets are weaker right now.
NEUT6|Why the disappointment?
BEAR7|If we look at the number the headline GDP for the third quarter disappointed the market.
BULL8|But if we look at the breakdown, the initial production retail sales beat the market expectation by a big margin.
BULL9|So the big picture is China's recovery is still on track, and more specifically the rebound which initially has been driven by investment by the supply side has now been extended to the.
NEUT10|Demand side and also the consumption.
BULL11|So if we look at consumption both in terms of goods, the retail sales rebounded to the positive territory and the consumption of service, which perhaps is more important indicator becauses of the social distancing measures as capture their service sector quite depressed.
BULL12|Also see improvement.
NEUT13|So if the the coronavirus remains under control.
NEUT14|Most likely the fourth quarter.
BEAR15|We may see a continuation of their recovery, but on the other hand, I would say we may have seen the sharpest part of the V shaped rebound as the economic activity approaching the potential level of the economy.
NEUT16|I think the market perhaps pay a lot of attention on the headline, but I would point out that the breakdown that detailed a number also matter.
NEUT17|"A lot."""
