BEAR0|"""From a certain perspective, this move looks like it's being driven by totally contradictory theories about the future."
NEUT1|Take the election today.
BULL2|The market traded like both Trump and Biden are going to win.
NEUT3|Seemingly impossible, but that's what the action seems to be saying.
BULL4|I mean, let me give you both perspectives, though on the Republican side with the President now feeling better and said to leave the hospital, they're betting you'll get a big bounce in popularity, not unlike what happened to Boris Johnson in the UK after he got sick.
NEUT5|Yes, Trump is expected to leave Walter Reed Medical at 6:30 PM that we, of course monitoring the situation and will keep you updated with the latest.
BULL6|Trump emerges from this thing physically unscathed or even better than that, as he claims on Twitter.
NEUT7|Maybe he could make a comeback and win the election.
NEUT8|That's the argument he started making today that you shouldn't worry so much about kovid because we've got some great drugs that can beat this thing.
BULL9|On the Democratic side, the Biden's been getting some strong polling numbers much better than Hillary's four years ago.
BULL10|It's increasingly looking like a landslide victory.
NEUT11|That's a real possibility.
NEUT12|The Democrats want this election to be a referendum on kovit.
BEAR13|Even with the president's find, the White House turning into a coronavirus hotspot, it's just called bad optics for the GOP.
NEUT14|Even though Biden wants to raise corporate taxes and capital gains taxes, and that is just not great for the market.
BULL15|There are a host of stocks that presumably do better under Democratic leadership.
NEUT16|Those stocks the China stocks they warned today.
BULL17|Jim, we some big gains in anything that benefits from more harmonious relationship with China.
BULL18|For good or ill, a Biden administration should be won't be as tough from the Chinese government.
BULL19|That's fantastic for the semiconductor stocks, it's a key leadership group.
BULL20|Does a ton of business over there, and the semis were fired today.
BEAR21|Lots of tech was on fire and that's China.
NEUT22|Let don't forget Caterpillar.
NEUT23|The usuals of course.
NEUT24|Only one candidate can actually win the election genius, but maybe there's a way to square the circle.
NEUT25|I think that we got today was the removal of uncertainty.
NEUT26|President Trump is not going to pass away from Covid.
NEUT27|Thank heavens.
BEAR28|And we probably won't have a contested election because some people think Biden's polling so well.
NEUT29|Now there's nothing the market hates more than uncertainty.
NEUT30|Take it away.
BULL31|Stocks go higher now.
NEUT32|Don't get me wrong, I'm not calling election or that's a suckers game.
NEUT33|If you're 2016, I'm just telling you what I see in the tape.
NEUT34|The tape speaks to me.
BULL35|I am translating a tape and telling you what it's saying now finding this is strong and that may turn into a strong hint for speaker Pelosi and her negotiations with the White House, which makes a stimulus built more likely.
NEUT36|The market needs some stink, some kind of stimulus package was going to keep running.
BULL37|Of course, the American people in this passage, if they're going to keep eating and the anticipation was powerful today.
NEUT38|Talks continue.
BULL39|Assuming we do get another bailout, that means the government will need to borrow a fortune.
BULL40|So of course interest rates are soaring.
BEAR41|While that's bad news for the housing, stock is pulled back from all time highs this morning.
BULL42|It's great for the banks.
NEUT43|Thank heavens which report next week.
BULL44|If they can argue that business will get better with higher rates and show they're doing well with the market's newfound volatility in record stock issuance, a possibility, then some of the financials might suddenly become viable model.
BEAR45|Then the second worst group in the market.
BULL46|Well, it could turn positive, and that would be a big deal.
NEUT47|Specially 'cause they report next week.
