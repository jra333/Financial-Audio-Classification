NEUT0|"""What is it smart to take a loss on the stock?"
NEUT1|It's always smart to take a loss in the stock when you keep that loss small.
NEUT2|Now this is a typical trade that we do.
NEUT3|Here you had a nice double bottom formation put in.
BULL4|We got along with the stock.
BEAR5|It did rally, however it began to breakdown.
NEUT6|We set our stop loss point and we got out.
NEUT7|When is it smart?
NEUT8|You don't feel all that good when you take that loss.
NEUT9|Because wow, I'm not a couple of bucks here.
NEUT10|However, when you Fast forward and you look at the stock that you could buy now at a 30% discount from where you got stopped out at, you know what you look.
BULL11|Pretty smart.
NEUT12|That's when it's smart to take a loss when you begin to buy back in, and that's what we're looking to do with Zynga ZNGA.
NEUT13|They are hiring new people, going into different markets, online gambling, they have a brand.
NEUT14|Many people, as many people know about Facebook, know about Zynga.
NEUT15|This is a brand, so I like single for the fact that you're going to have one of the very few names in online gaming that is a well known Main Street brand and big fat margins in that business.
BULL16|So I like the fact that they had a nice key reversal off of bad earnings report released on Thursday.
BEAR17|It gapped down reverse off the bottom big capitulation volume on Friday.
NEUT18|I'm going to drill down after that 30 minute chart in it and we want to take a look at the short interest I will be sending out alerts to Members on this trade, so most have no fears.
NEUT19|I will be sending out an alert.
NEUT20|Just like I sent out alone at first by and when we got stopped out, let's take a look at the 30 minute chart.
NEUT21|I use your gap down support at $2.21.
BULL22|Beautiful rally off the lows.
NEUT23|Here you had, you know shorts covering or yet institutions begin to buy back in.
NEUT24|My guess was more shorts covering you want institutions in when it comes back down.
NEUT25|Retest these loads.
NEUT26|Hold and then rally Shire.
NEUT27|Are we ready just yet to begin to buy Zynga?
NEUT28|No, not quite yet.
NEUT29|It could take place early this coming week.
NEUT30|OK, let's take a look at the book value of the stock.
NEUT31|It's trading at book right now.
NEUT32|Slightly above it.
NEUT33|Book values.
NEUT34|$2.46 per share were $2.48.
NEUT35|Short interest on the stock is 11.7%.
BEAR36|The one concern here I have is that you have a total number of shares short of 18.92 million shares, three month average daily volume is almost 19 and a half million shares, so this percentage short.
NEUT37|Is somewhat deceiving.
NEUT38|So be careful, don't take too much solace in the fact there's a big short interest in the stock.
BULL39|I do believe that there could be a good short covering rally, just not as big as what you may think, so you still need to use discipline when you're buying up the stock an.
NEUT40|If this chart did not teach you that you need discipline when grading into this talk, please, I'm warning.
NEUT41|Before 1, do not go chasing the stock higher.
NEUT42|We will look to enter the stock when the risk reward is at R's is in our favor.
NEUT43|We thought it was our favorite back here when he was putting in a nice consolidation.
BEAR44|Double bottom action began to breakdown.
NEUT45|We exited.
NEUT46|"So I will be sending out alert if and when we get one of Zynga."""
