NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol UPC."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint but you look down there at.
BULL5|The volume man well above average volume on the day and right now things are.
NEUT6|Looking a little shaky, I mean, can you say that the charts destroyed now?
NEUT7|In my opinion, that's way too dramatic, but can you say that the charts look in a little sketchy?
NEUT8|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT9|So really, the question becomes moving forward, you know, is this bullish?
NEUT10|Is their bearish?
NEUT11|What exactly is going on?
NEUT12|And in my mind, the level to watch in the very helpful area to keep a close eye and is going to be right there at 495.
NEUT13|And how is this area helpful?
NEUT14|And I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT15|Let's say the price comes down here and then just continues on down.
NEUT16|What would you have at that point?
NEUT17|You would have the price.
NEUT18|I've been gone right back to where it was and I mean not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT19|But price movements like go back to where they were.
NEUT20|Not exactly Sinotruk power to strength or anything like that, but I mean to be fair, no price just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here.
NEUT21|Behave in that manner, then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT22|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there, you have those lows down there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps, well, hey there we go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
BULL23|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT24|And in this situation, quote unquote progress.
NEUT25|Being defined right there at 495.
NEUT26|So actuality that green line kind of represents, like our dictionary meaning is the planets helping to define what's going on?
NEUT27|Is the price, quote unquote, going back to?
NEUT28|It was that associated with Bearishness or is the price quote unquote?
NEUT29|Making progress that associated with bullishness?
NEUT30|So keep it on that level.
BULL31|In my mind, that's going to be very important, helpful level to watch moving forward.
NEUT32|If the price does try to head back upwards at all.
NEUT33|Now first key battleground going to be right there at 575, but let's see what this one has to offer us.
NEUT34|Continue as time continues to play out.

NEUT37|But it will be me.
NEUT38|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL39|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
