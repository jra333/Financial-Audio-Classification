NEUT0|"""So how's it going so far with online sales?"
BEAR1|Your stock has been a monster.
BULL2|It leapt up almost 10% on Friday.
NEUT3|What does it look like?
BULL4|Well, we haven't updated our earnings since since we announced our Q3 earnings, but what we said then was the third quarter was a tremendous quarter for Etsy with gross merchandise sales up over 110% year over year and just to put that in perspective, e-commerce is growing somewhere between 35 and 40%, which is.
BEAR5|An unthinkable number pre pandemic.
BULL6|You know, an Etsy growing at at 100 and 15120% year over year means we're gaining huge share against an ecommerce landscape that's growing.
NEUT7|You know, really, massively, and I think that's because Etsy stands for something really different and a time when there are so many people who are trying to sell you the exact same thing for maybe $0.02 cheaper or ship it one hour faster.
NEUT8|People are yearning for something that speaks to them that where they can connect with another human being where a product is made just for them.
NEUT9|Injecting a little bit of special in their life, and that's what it is all about.
BEAR10|Your stocks up right now is down earlier.
NEUT11|We've had this pattern of vaccine Mondays on Wall Street where we get thankfully good news from a Pfizer or Moderna today.
NEUT12|Moderna applying for emergency use authorization and some of the stay at home winners like a peloton or zoom or an Etsy sell off is that the right takeaway that your business ultimately cannot keep up at this feverish pace when we do have a vaccine and people can go back to shopping in stores.
BEAR13|First, I want to acknowledge that the pandemic has been incredibly **** ** people all across America.
NEUT14|And all across the world, and we can't get past this soon enough.
NEUT15|And we had at sea are desperate to get past this and I'm sure the rest of the world is as well.
BULL16|But this moment has really highlighted the strength of the Etsy model, the agility.
NEUT17|So at a moment when the world all of the sudden need needed masks, Etsy sellers were able to start making and selling masks within hours of the CDC recommending that people wear masks, and in fact in just the second and third quarter at C, sellers sold $600 million.
NEUT18|Worth of masks?
BULL19|That's a product category that affectively didn't exist, you know, and all the all the sudden it did, but as he's done so much more than masks in fact non mask sales were up 92% year over year in the third quarter and that's the everyday things you need to live.
NEUT20|It's home furnishings.
BULL21|Home furnishings are up over 125% year over year.
NEUT22|In fact Etsy sellers sold more than $2.4 billion worth of home furnishings.
BULL23|Jewelry and apparel are up 50 and 60% year over year and of course things like personalized gifts for the Holidays.
NEUT24|These are things that you're going to need every year in a pandemic, not in a pandemic, and I think what people are discovering is.
NEUT25|There's just a better way to shop.
BULL26|Connecting with the actual person who made the product and having it sent just to you is just a better way to shop, and we're really pleased.
NEUT27|And the proof is in the pudding about the how many people are coming back again and again to shop.
BULL28|On Etsy, because the the purchase is so delightful for them.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
