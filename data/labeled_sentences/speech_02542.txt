NEUT0|"""Department of Justice antitrust division."
NEUT1|Deirdre bosa.
NEUT2|With the news teardrop.
NEUT3|Hey Sarah, that's right.
BEAR4|Shares of Alphabet dropped sharply.
BEAR5|They never covered a little bit down more than 2% in the after hours and this comes on some headlines from Dow Jones that says that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are likely to bring antitrust lawsuits against Google, citing sources they say that its focus.
NEUT6|The DOJ is focused on Google's advertising business and how it has used its dominance in search.
NEUT7|It also says that it's looking at a probable summer timetable.
NEUT8|States could file in the fall and that the.
NEUT9|Antitrust enforcers are well into preparation for litigation, so we know that regulators were looking into alphabet for on these antitrust concerns, but we didn't previously have a timetable.
NEUT10|We didn't know how far along they were, so this report saying that it could be coming soon.
NEUT11|We've reached out to Alphabet and Google and will let you know when we hear back.
NEUT12|Well, and not only that, dear drumming wasn't it sort of assumed, or at least the bulls on these stocks were.
NEUT13|Assuming that you know we're in the middle of a global pandemic, a massive recession.
BEAR14|Everybody's work is completely disrupted, and a lot of these tech companies are actually being relied on as part of the solution.
NEUT15|With contact tracing and other things.
NEUT16|For those that were assuming that maybe this would have been put on the backburner at least till after the election.
NEUT17|This might come as a big surprise.
BEAR18|Yeah, I think I think you're right and that's why we saw the sharp sell off in the after hours that Google and the other big tech companies have really showed how useful how essential they are in daily life and work from home life.
NEUT19|And as you said, even contact tracing.
BEAR20|So potentially for the health authorities that a lot of these antitrust concerns were put on the back burner for investors.
NEUT21|And this is really a reminder that they are far from over.
NEUT22|We've heard rumblings about, especially when it comes to Amazon and workplace safety, but with Google especially, I think there was this thought that.
BULL23|It has proved so useful and so critical during the pandemic that perhaps antitrust concerns would be delayed.
NEUT24|"But this report from Dow Jones saying that it could come as early as this summer."""
