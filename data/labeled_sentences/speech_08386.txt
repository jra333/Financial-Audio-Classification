BEAR0|"""Call you're watching **** is copy TV onlain stance and the US economy added just 100 and 48,000 jobs last month."
BEAR1|A steep drop from the 193 thousand created in August and below expectations for an increase of 180,000 indicating that job growth has actually slowed before the recent shutdown, the unemployment rate lowered to 7.2% from 7.3% in August.
BEAR2|But this was partially due to more people dropping out of the labor force.
NEUT3|Vincent Cignarella from the Wall Street Journal joins me on the line now Vincent.
NEUT4|How accurate are these figures?
NEUT5|Accurate to the point that there are, it's it's going to be revised.
BEAR6|And as we saw with the two months prior jobs data is subject to great revisions.
NEUT7|I think.
BEAR8|I think it's accurate in the sense that business foresaw what the shutdown was going to do, and that slowed jobs growth.
NEUT9|In that sense, business leaders tend to take a more sanguine approach to it.
NEUT10|The politics in Washington, I think.
NEUT11|Then the politicians in Washington take for themselves ********.
NEUT12|How will this data affect Janet Yellen's decision to introduce tapering if it is not?
BEAR13|Already been introduced, I think it's going to delay it probably a lot more than people may even think.
NEUT14|I think there's the markets now tending to look towards March.
BEAR15|Potentially this could not even be a 2014 decision if the unemployment numbers continue to weaken or not gain considerably.
NEUT16|You know the Feds decision is data driven, and if the data do not support altering monetary accommodation, I don't think they will.
NEUT17|I think they're caught.
BEAR18|In a very difficult situation, the dollar struggles near 9 month low today.
NEUT19|How concerned should we be about this?
BEAR20|Well, I think the dollar is on its heels for two reasons, primarily because of fiscal policy in the United States.
BEAR21|Is a bit inept with the bickering between the Republicans and the Democrats, and that's put the Fed somewhat handcuffed in their decision making.
NEUT22|And if you were to take that with any other country in the United States outside of the United States, you would you would be selling that country.
NEUT23|That currency aggressively, and I think that is that is what we're seeing with the dollar, and it's going to.
BULL24|It's going to put it's going to continue to keep the dollar under pressure.
NEUT25|I think for the short term, Vincent thank you very much for joining me on the line today and that's all for me for now.
NEUT26|But do check back for more interviews and updates from the TV team.
NEUT27|"Bye for now."""
