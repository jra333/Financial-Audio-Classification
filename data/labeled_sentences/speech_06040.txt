BULL0|"""Good day everyone."
NEUT1|This is onion is Thursday, April 1st.
NEUT2|Free market this morning to look over sundial growers with you as some technical insight.
NEUT3|Short selling activity.
NEUT4|Institutional Holdings.
NEUT5|There are a few changes yesterday with the institutions.
NEUT6|If you look here just after 6:00 o'clock in a bit in the ask are you know a little bit over yesterday's close with 1.5 million shares traded.
NEUT7|Basically the same thing as is almost, you know, almost every day is the same thing.
NEUT8|Like the price goes up in the morning and then drops around 10:00 o'clock.
NEUT9|Seems to be the pattern anyway.
NEUT10|If we look at the.
NEUT11|No, the last week here we can update his lot of their signals, you know, have been triggered here and even on the chart.
BEAR12|The share price is below the 21 and 50 day moving average and both averages have Crosson enough.
NEUT13|Separating and going in the wrong direction.
BULL14|So right now the chart showing bearish momentum will be continued.
BEAR15|Lower indicators are saying the same thing, but it's not going to be a quick drop.
BEAR16|If it does continue to drop.
BULL17|You know everything is starting to level out here, but we're going to see this Mac D start to curl up and get closer to that zero line again, and if it crosses the average line, that will be a sign of reversal.
NEUT18|For now, all the lower indicators are showing sideways action or you know slightly down, so you know it's going to be.
NEUT19|Basically, you're going to see today what you've been seeing all week.
NEUT20|It's just it's just going to be accumulation of empire coding right now.
NEUT21|The RSI is at 44 share price can go in either direction, but you know even the RSI is pretty much level data is so short selling activity it was.
NEUT22|It was average.
NEUT23|Yesterday wasn't heavy, wasn't late.
NEUT24|You know 22% is not that high for sundial.
NEUT25|You can see here this is, you know this is the month of March here and there have been, you know, quite a few days that have been over 30, so you know the price is getting pretty low to short.
NEUT26|They know to sell short so I would think that the you know the short sellers will start hitting the price a little bit harder once it goes up.
NEUT27|You know closer to that $1.25 mark you can see here.
NEUT28|I just I just checked and as of 6:00 o'clock if you wanted to borrow to sell short today at the rate is 1.17% and there's ten million shares available.
NEUT29|So the institutional activity there was one added position that I wrote down.
NEUT30|There was a few changes, but the one at a position that was reported yesterday was the American Growth Fund AMR EXM Rex.
NEUT31|They added 27,000 shares, sold it.
BULL32|That's a new position, 100% increase.
NEUT33|But the institutional ownership has changed.
NEUT34|There has been a few.
BEAR35|There's been one additional owner, so you went from 53 to 54 this morning, but the ownership percentage drop because there were quite a few.
BEAR36|Institutions that reduced their Holdings, and I'm I'm still getting the information.
NEUT37|And so as soon as I get that, I'll write it down like a like I did up here.
BEAR38|But yeah, there's there's been a drop in percentage, but in additional institutional owner, and that's that's it this morning.
NEUT39|So like I said, I'm going to look through the filings in that.
NEUT40|Maybe over the weekend, and I'll try to get exact numbers for you, so hope this video helps.
BULL41|"Wonderful day trading and good luck."""
