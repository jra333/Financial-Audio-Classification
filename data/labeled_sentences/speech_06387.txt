NEUT0|"""OK, we wanted a little squak picking this morning."
NEUT1|Chris Brown is here.
NEUT2|He's the head of technical analysis and a partner Strategus research in one of his picks is Morgan Stanley.
NEUT3|I want to start with that because maybe you can juxtapose Morgan with how you think about Goldman Sachs.
NEUT4|We were just having that conversation with with Guy who said that Morgan Stanley is a little bit more like the old Goldman Goldman's a little bit more like the sort of sort of post crisis Morgan.
NEUT5|For a moment, it certainly trace that way.
BEAR6|And let's keep in mind both these names, Goldman Morgan had 40% declines last year.
BEAR7|These were devastating bear markets.
BEAR8|We think they're bottoming Morgan Stanley back above its 200 day moving average for the first time in a year.
BULL9|Maybe this is a sign that the yield curve actually steepens here.
BULL10|Maybe this is a sign that rates actually go up.
NEUT11|I think that is the message coming from some of these banks here and you like Morgan, I do.
NEUT12|But Goldman on your list or is that absolutely?
NEUT13|I think this whole space, the banking the brokerage based, I mean even JP Morgan.
NEUT14|So protocol for you, it's a broad call for us.
BEAR15|We think rates are starting to bottom here.
NEUT16|We think, frankly, signs of cyclicality or emerging everywhere banks benefit from.
NEUT17|But if it's Morgan.
NEUT18|Or the others meaning it's either or situation.
NEUT19|You take Morgan because I do.
BULL20|I think it's emerging as the leader here to outperform Goldman.
BEAR21|It's turned after this 40% drawdown.
BULL22|It's starting to exhibit some leadership.
NEUT23|That's the type of stock that we want to hear.
NEUT24|OK, let's talk about another one on your list.
NEUT25|Which is Disney here.
NEUT26|Obviously a big stock in the news that's already moved.
NEUT27|Yeah, I mean it is moved about as as much as you could possibly imagine, but you think it's got more to run?
BULL28|Yeah, I disagree that it's moved that much here.
NEUT29|It's done nothing for five years right up there are but $20 billion in a week is not bad.
BULL30|Yeah up, big after five weeks of nothing.
NEUT31|We think this is just getting started.
BULL32|It has the benefit of a very good sector behind it.
BULL33|That whole media consumer group is getting better.
NEUT34|Another name it hasn't paid people for half of a decade.
BULL35|Starting to outperform Netflix here too, which is important.
BEAR36|It's outperforming its own consumer peers.
BULL37|So signs of leadership coming from a very big important stock.
NEUT38|We like it here long so, but just explain how you think this is going to trade.
NEUT39|'cause I'm assuming there's a honeymoon period here as everybody awaits awaits this actual product, right?
NEUT40|Disney Plus and is is it a?
NEUT41|Buy on the news.
NEUT42|So I mean you see there's going to be a you know was gonna be a moment here.
NEUT43|This is a name that was improving long before any of us knew about Disney.
BULL44|Plus this is a stock that's been getting better all year.
NEUT45|OK, it's been between 70 and 1:20 for the better part of the last five years.
NEUT46|It's through 120 now.
NEUT47|We think 175 maybe 200 over the next couple of years where this goes.
BEAR48|This is a major base breakout.
NEUT49|As technicians, these are the charge we just dream of.
NEUT50|OK, he's on the charge, but from a fundamental point of view, when you see a breakout like this in Disney Guy and this is on not arrays outlook not.
BULL51|Hard numbers on hold Expectational expected that Disney Plus will have this many subscribers at this price point.
NEUT52|Your point from 2 weeks ago.
NEUT53|You know from from a couple of years of just pray trading sideways within a certain band.
NEUT54|Is Chris just pointed out?
NEUT55|How do you trade it great?
NEUT56|Well now this is trading at close to 22 times forward earnings, right?
BEAR57|I mean, that's a staggering number for the space.
BEAR58|Then it's a staggering number for Disney.
NEUT59|Well, it probably trades at twice the multiples.
NEUT60|Some of its peers.
NEUT61|Maybe they deserve it.
NEUT62|I don't know.
BEAR63|To Chris's point to your point, through 120 was a huge breakout, but they were.
NEUT64|Ford earnings I believe on May 8th.
BULL65|They better crush numbers on May 8th.
NEUT66|Otherwise I think it just sort of back and fills the levels we just saw now yes, it had been trading along this range and finally broke out.
NEUT67|A lot of people now piling into the name, but you have to look at valuation at a certain point.
NEUT68|And what did they really change other than that announcement?
BULL69|"That would be my push back."""
