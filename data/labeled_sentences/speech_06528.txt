NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Tuesday, January the 9th Time review board young currencyanalystericsson.com and today were going to looking at the euro versus the yen on the four hour chart and see your yen is looking rather bearish at the moment."
BEAR1|RSI is sharply below 50, though it hasn't quite reached at 30 oversold levels, so I just suggest there is scope for some further losses and it has also.
BEAR2|Just dipped below the 78.6% Fiona.
NEUT3|She retracement of the download from 134 point 97233.89.
BULL4|It had earlier managed to settle just around that.
BEAR5|Hotel yeah around 134.65 but it is seeing some additional downside pressure at the moment, so clearly the near term bias is to the downside and so the next target would be 134.50 to 61.8% of people Nachi and further losses could lead it towards the 50% Fibonacci 134.38.
BULL6|Breach of the 50% Fibonacci could open the way towards 133.89.
BEAR7|That's the low from late December and then below that we have the 200 moving average around 133.60.
BULL8|If however the European does reverse higher, which is possible given that the medium term outlook is clearly still bullish, price action is comfortably above the both the 50 and 200 day moving averages.
NEUT9|And we can see them.
BEAR10|Act is also still very positive, though it has just crossed below its red signal light, suggesting weakening of the bullish momentum in the medium term, but still very much Polish that target up the next closest target is the 134.87 level which is.
NEUT11|The top from late December.
NEUT12|Above that we have the 50 moving average around 35.27 currently, then 135.47 and then 136.45.
BEAR13|We can see that the reason why prices stalled at 136.62 that was in fact the three month high.
NEUT14|You can see that was clearly the 261.8% coupon.
BULL15|She was a strong resistance level.
BULL16|A4 Euro yen so break above that region could open the way towards the 138 handle which is before in 23.6% fewer nacci.
NEUT17|That's it for me.
BULL18|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
