NEUT0|"""Today we're going to talk about the next big thing, the possible Apple of the cryptocurrency scene, named Flow or other company behind it, which is called Devil Apps."
NEUT1|That collapse was founded by the creators of Crypto Kitties, one of the major NFT games back in the days.
NEUT2|The founders themselves have an insane track record of founding very successful companies, all in the area of being platforms for developers.
NEUT3|Deborah Lapse has a total of five funding rounds, with the 1st for being rather small between 5:00 and 10:00 million, and they just recently closed the venture out of $305 million, which gives them a valuation now of $2.6 billion, their currency flow is about building a platform for developers to create their own decentralized apps.
NEUT4|Their unique feature.
NEUT5|What sets them apart from all the other debt platforms on the cryptosphere.
NEUT6|Is that in addition they not only build their own platform, but they also built their own apps.
NEUT7|I mean, what do you need a platform for if no one builds apps on it, right?
NEUT8|So the currently most successful depth in the crypto scene is called NBA Top Shot, which is made from them and is also running on flow.
NEUT9|The reason why NBA top shirt is so successful and is getting so much and more and more attention is because of their revenue share model, meaning that the involved NBA players get a percentage of the revenue which is generated from the sale of the NFTS, which is exactly what is now attracting more and more organ.
NEUT10|Big organizations like the UFC, which are already planning to create their own FT also running on flow flow is definitely one of the safest bets you can do in the old coin market.
NEUT11|"Their founders are incredibly smart and always one step ahead of everyone."""
