BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about Morgan Stanley and and then I hope will be done with banks 'cause banks are just not interesting.
NEUT2|So what they do is banking shocker.
NEUT3|I know stock price $78 which gives the market cap of $147 billion.
BULL4|Revenue $45.3 billion, which is up from the previous year, which is amazing earnings $11 billion, which is also up from the previous year, which is also amazing.
NEUT5|And the current P is 12 with a forward PE of 14 and I color coded these two know which is forward in which is backward, obviously 'cause.
NEUT6|You know?
NEUT7|There is a difference.
NEUT8|Dividend yield 1.79% with a payout ratio of 21.65%, which is nice.
NEUT9|I mean it's it's decent.
BULL10|The payout ratio is really good, but dividend these days could go way higher.
NEUT11|Total assets $1.12 trillion total liabilities $1.01 trillion, which gives them installed stockholders equity of $102 billion.
BULL12|Not bad.
NEUT13|I guess.
BULL14|Stockholders equity 2/3 of the market cap, which is also nice.
NEUT15|So kind of like this balance sheet, but it's still a bank so.
NEUT16|Prefer less balanced, more assets.
NEUT17|Risk factors.
NEUT18|Apparently nothing, I guess.
NEUT19|Can't imagine a world that fundamentally changes so much that it's a risk to Morgan Stanley, so you know.
NEUT20|Again, oil oil is one.
NEUT21|I don't know how much though, so overall, for growth investor big banks are still not what you're looking for.
NEUT22|For a dividend investor, I think the dividend is quite easy and and it's good for diversification play or for like a foundation of the portfolio because it's a fairly stable stock and.
NEUT23|It's a fairly safe sock, so definitely wouldn't blame you for looking into this for a value investor, I think that the P is really nice.
BULL24|The dividend is decent, the balance sheet is decent, and the revenue and earnings are growing through a global pandemic, so that can't be terrible, so definitely would advise a deeper look here as well.
NEUT25|I think that again, as a foundation for a portfolio.
BULL26|This is definitely not a terrible stock, so probably a pretty good purchase here.
NEUT27|That's it for me.
NEUT28|For today.
