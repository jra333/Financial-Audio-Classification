NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|Today will be looking at USD CAD on the daily chart so zoom in we can see that the looney has found some footing at the 100 day simple moving average residing at the one point 3724 khytrov following a break of the foundation of a trading range that commenced around early April, the price has been weakening ever since he tested the ceiling of the horizontal market at one point, 4264, backed by the intact negative ichimoku lines.
BULL2|Promoting additional weakening in prices.
BULL3|The declining 50 days of May and the Mac D. That said, the RSI and stochastic oscillator indoors further advances.
NEUT4|Traders also need to be aware of the predominant bullish tone of the 100 and 200 day Smas assisting this view.
NEUT5|Should buy his foothold, be adequate, initial resistance may originate from the 1.38 zero nine level, that being the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the public from one point 2951 to one point 4667 and the one point 3850 obstacle moving higher.
BEAR6|If the lower surface of the Chaco cloud around one point 3933 fails to hold the climb, it could be challenged by the resistance region from the 38.2% figure of one point 4012 to the one point 4047 high, which encompasses the 50 days, may as well.
NEUT7|Of running this border, the one point 4173 and one point 4140 highs that capture the upper band of the cloud may apply the breaks to the downside.
BULL8|Immediate support may occur at the 100 day SMAP at that rough of one point 3724 ahead of the one point 3681 barrier.
BEAR9|If selling interest persists, the pair could rest at the 61.8% FIB of 1.36 zero eight before it meets the one point 3517 obstacle and the 200 day MA at one point 3469.
BEAR10|Underneath summarizing the short term bearish picture may be at risk if the price remains above one point 3724 and a shift over one point 3850 may see a neutral to bullish bias return.
NEUT11|That's it from me.
BULL12|"Have a great training day."""
