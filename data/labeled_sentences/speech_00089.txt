NEUT0|"""Hey you guys remember yesterday how I said this is going to be my last known dimensions video for the week?"
NEUT1|Well I just want to say about that well.
NEUT2|Anyways let me just get into it real quick.
NEUT3|So Nano dimension just released another share offering.
NEUT4|And what did I say yesterday I said yesterday everyone they're planning on doing a stock offering so be sure to be ready for another plunge or be ready for it to go down a little bit, maybe 9.
NEUT5|$8.00 just in case.
NEUT6|Just be ready and look what happened, but I do want to go ahead and get into the news and say what's happening.
NEUT7|And if you like channels that get straight to the point without shoving promotional things and advertising down your throat, then subscribe to the channel 'cause on this channel we're about getting to the point and not wasting your time, so let's get into it.
NEUT8|Nano Dimension ticker symbol.
NEUT9|An NDM has released another stock offering and what is the stock offering you might ask?
NEUT10|Well, it's very simple.
NEUT11|It's where a company which owns.
NEUT12|Its own shares and said company.
NEUT13|So let's say no dimension.
NEUT14|In this example, let's say they have 50,000 shares of their own company.
NEUT15|OK, when the stock price goes up and up and up, and let's say it goes 50% up more than what they thought it would, the company will sell their shares and get some revenue off that stock offering.
NEUT16|And just like that now dimension has more funding as of today's direct offering, nano dimension price is $332.5 million.
NEUT17|From this offering, they did said offering at a share price of $9.
BEAR18|And $0.50, which yesterday Nano Dimension was down 7% in after hours and Nano dimension is no shy person whenever it comes to stock offerings.
NEUT19|They've done this a couple times before and they just did one last month, which according to Global Newswire, raised $180 million.
BEAR20|And if we go ahead and look at Nano Dimension right now on Robinhood Ono, Ono Nano Dimension is down 9%, what do we do?
NEUT21|An I know a ton of you are new to the channel and let me just say we love red days like this and we love how to stock is down.
NEUT22|Dollar overall and you guys who are long term subscribers you already know what we do on these days we buy buy buy for those who are not in yet and they want to get in.
NEUT23|This is a perfect time to get in because you never know when the stock is going to drop and you never know when the stock is going to go up and in situations like these time end the market easily overpowers timing the market.
NEUT24|And right now the time is perfect for you to get in.
NEUT25|If you want you guys know I'm not a financial advisor but I can't help it whenever it comes to these red days.
NEUT26|And in my eyes, this is a fire sale, but as of right now all you need to do is just buy more.
NEUT27|If you want of course, and just hold, hold, hold hodl bro hottel.
NEUT28|I know that this is a really short video and I know that I could have extended it longer, but I don't want to be SUV and I don't want to waste your time because there's nothing else out for the stock as of right now.
BULL29|If you like the video, I'm glad I really hope you did.
NEUT30|Go ahead and leave a comment down below at what strike price.
BULL31|You got in at Neo, and if you're going to buy more, I appreciate you guys.
