NEUT0|"""Becky, I'm just noticing something that we should bring up because it's going to be of interest to everybody and certainly in the market today."
NEUT1|Bank of America is just downgraded Apple.
NEUT2|Believe it or not, you know, on the heels of our conversation there downgrading shares to neutral.
BULL3|They say risk reward is now more balanced at these levels.
BULL4|They say they had argued for a valuation multiple reiterating in their note back in June, and they say since then the stock has had such a rapid multiple expansion.
NEUT5|They point to a number of other.
NEUT6|Issues as well.
BULL7|Lower impact from share buybacks.
NEUT8|Right?
NEUT9|Apple buys back a lot of stock.
NEUT10|They say there's going to be a lower impact.
BULL11|Their potential risk of a higher tax rate in the event of a domestic win in the US elections in November.
BEAR12|Talking about COVID-19 services, deceleration, lower gross margins overall.
NEUT13|But it's interesting Mike, as you look at us to look Goldman Sachs in the last couple of weeks is reiterated a sell rating on the stock.
BEAR14|They've obviously been wrong for a long way.
NEUT15|On the stock, so that doesn't mean all that much.
BEAR16|But now as you get this stock closer to two trillion, you are going to have more firms coming out and questioning whether you know the multiple has gotten too rich.
NEUT17|It's expanded too fast, absolutely, and if you look at the rationale for this downgrade, it really does read like a lot of excuses for down grading the stock to neutral, taking profits.
BULL18|That one that's gotten ahead of itself and looks overbought.
BULL19|I mean, Apple yesterday got to 45% above its 200 day average.
NEUT20|That's a technical measure, but it's way richer.
BULL21|Relative to its trend, then it was back in in the top in February.
NEUT22|So obviously maybe you need to cooling off.
NEUT23|Doesn't mean it's total reversal of the trend, but it's tougher to make the case for new money into the stock at these levels, especially by the way, to the degree that the excitement lately is about a four foot one stocks, but the company is going to do.
NEUT24|That's never necessarily an enduring reason that the value of the shares should be going higher.
NEUT25|I mean like to your point on that this this really is a laundry list.
NEUT26|Reading through some of this stuff, Scott talked about a lot of the issues they site, but they also talk about the antitrust regulation potential out there for the App Store, and they mentioned the China trade risks that create additional risk to some of these things.
NEUT27|So there's a huge laundry list.
NEUT28|You're right, these are the things everybody's been talking about.
NEUT29|The headline has to be the huge runup they've seen, and all of a sudden, OK.
NEUT30|The risk reward scenario changes a bit.
NEUT31|Based on that, that's exactly it.
NEUT32|It's not so much that they're predicting any of these bad things happen, but that the price.
NEUT33|Right now it is not necessarily account.
NEUT34|For a high likelihood of anything going wrong from here, so see how it trades today on this on this downgrade, but for the most part, downgrades haven't mattered much, much to Apple, you know, I remember I remember the day that that Goldman Becky reiterated their sell.
BEAR35|It really wasn't there couple weeks ago, stocked in react negatively negatively to that at all.
NEUT36|It's almost like the market laughs at people who try and, you know, get off the Apple Train, or at least put the yellow light up and say maybe it's time for a little bit of caution that you can't just have a go green for the.
NEUT37|The entire time while it lasts until the stocks kind of ready and gotten overdone already.
NEUT38|I mean, we've had long periods of time when it's gone sideways, even in this massive run of the last of the last few years.
NEUT39|"So see if see if this is the time."""
