NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Monday, June 19th.
NEUT2|I'm Celina, Nicholas technical analysts are exam.com.
BEAR3|Today will look at pound Kiwi on the daily chart, so pound Kiwi has been a downtrend since May 11.
BEAR4|High of one point 8958 and then we saw prices have been falling in a descending channel an reached the low one point 7438 last week.
BEAR5|The slow now is an immediate support level an following from this we have another low.
BEAR6|Another support one point 7140 March 1st Low and then very important swing low at one point 6827 but break above the 200 day moving average and a sustained move above the range high of one point.
NEUT7|7766 would target resistance provided by the base of the Ichimoku cloud here.
NEUT8|So first resistance at 1.8008.
BEAR9|If we look at the technical indicators, they are bearish with oscillators like the RSI and MACD D, both being bearish with Mike D below 0 and RSI below 50.
NEUT10|The market does not look like it can push any higher in the near term.
BEAR11|Mean momentum is weak and prices are kept by this 200 day moving average at one point 7685.
BEAR12|Also, other technical studies are pointing to a bearish picture as market trades below the ichimoku cloud and the tank and send line.
BEAR13|That's the red line crossed below the Kijun Sen line in May, giving a bearish signal and keeping the biased to the downside.
BEAR14|So in the near term it appears prices are consolidating just below the 200 day moving average.
BEAR15|But the bias is skewed to the downside in the near term.
NEUT16|An looking at the bigger picture, there is no clear trend in the medium term.
BULL17|At least it looks like prices are just.
BULL18|Trying to consolidate the longer term downtrend but only a rise back above the cloud.
BULL19|Each McLeod would bring back a more bullish outlook.
BULL20|Thank you so much for watching.
BULL21|"Have a great day."""
