NEUT0|"""Already guys so right here we have Disney ticker symbol."
BULL1|Diaz pulled up on the chart and you want to be keeping an eye on Disney this week because as we can see they're starting to bounce off of this 50 SMAD on the daily time frame which looks pretty bullish to me an it acted as support back here.
BULL2|So definitely expect a continuation on Disney and we could also see that the Mac D is starting to curl up.
NEUT3|These are all bullish signs to go long on a stock.
BULL4|Expect a continuation higher and potentially even for them to retest their all time high.
NEUT5|"Pretty soon, make sure to like and subscribe if you want to see more videos like this."""
