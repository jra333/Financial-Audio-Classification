BULL0|"""Should there be cause here or pause here I should say over the rapid move in euro strength."
BULL1|Thanks so much.
NEUT2|I'm look.
NEUT3|We are generally of the view that this you remove has further to go.
BULL4|I think that you know one has to remember that yes it's had a lot of momentum in the last few sessions.
BULL5|As you say, the rates of change have been have been phenomenal, but one also has to recall that this is coming after several years of dollar strength.
BULL6|So the dollar has been on a multiyear move higher.
NEUT7|And So what you are seeing here is a very rapid but still, you know, not complete unwind of many, many years.
NEUT8|Of dollar strength so you know when you when I zoom out on a big picture sense.
BEAR9|I think the dollar has further to go weaker.
BULL10|I think the euro has further to move higher over 12 months.
NEUT11|Forecasts are at 1:25 so I'm not too concerned about the levels here.
NEUT12|Although I do agree with you that I think the rates of change have been extremely fast and what has been especially interesting about the recent moves.
NEUT13|Is that they are coming against the backdrop, not necessarily of euro areas trend, although your area outperformance is something that you know we we we subscribe to but also coming against the backdrop for some weaker data in the US.
NEUT14|So it's it's.
BEAR15|"It's that interesting dichotomy that is playing out and pushing the euro higher and the dollar weaker in the last few sessions."""
