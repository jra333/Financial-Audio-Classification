BULL0|"""I loved the interplay with Becky and Warren Buffett this weekend and his discussion very can discussion at the airlines."
NEUT1|If the airlines are fundamentally changed, what that really says it in buffet size.
NEUT2|What it really says.
NEUT3|Is there a lot of industries that are fundamentally changed?
NEUT4|I keep coming back to that moment.
NEUT5|What was Gary Kelly said thus?
NEUT6|Well, if there's nothing to go to, why should the airlines do well?
NEUT7|How do you said look, I have to stick by the airlines 'cause there's going to be a recovery and they're the ones that are most oriented.
NEUT8|I would.
NEUT9|I might have influenced my thinking, but.
NEUT10|I felt like he verified a lot of what Dave and I are hearing, which is that guys please if you think that we're just going to come back, you've got it really wrong.
NEUT11|And I maybe they're doing some.
NEUT12|They're doing some under promising, but then you layer it on with the president who was so I believe over promising.
NEUT13|And I'm not fake news.
NEUT14|I'm just listening to every single CEO, with the exception of Moderna that really believes in the drug industry that we can get, do vaccines scale so I feel like that.
NEUT15|That Buffett's overview on airlines really does make me very concerned about the near term.
NEUT16|Yeah, and as a backdrop of course.
NEUT17|Buffett has a long history in having his thinking evolved when it comes to the airline business.
BEAR18|US air back in the 90s left their rather sour taste in his mouth about that.
NEUT19|He came around to them in the last five or ten years and he talked about what he called a mistake over the weekend.
NEUT20|Take a listen.
BEAR21|The airline business and I may be wrong and I hope I'm wrong, but I think it.
NEUT22|It changed in a very major way an it's obviously changed in the fact that there.
NEUT23|Four companies are each going to borrow and perhaps.
NEUT24|Average of at least.
NEUT25|10 or 12 billion H Why you have to pay that back out of earnings over some period of time here 10 or $12 billion worse off.
NEUT26|If that happens.
NEUT27|And of course.
NEUT28|In some cases, they're having to.
NEUT29|Sell stock or sell the right to buy a stock of these prices and that takes away from the upside down and I don't know.
NEUT30|Weather 2 or three years from now that that as many people will fly as many passenger miles is.
NEUT31|As they did last year, they may, and they may not have this, but the future is much less clear to me.
NEUT32|Amada how the business will turn out through absolutely no fault of the airlines themselves.
BEAR33|So I thought that was devastated.
BULL34|I mean, remember Southwest Air is able to sell 70,070 million shares.
BEAR35|I'm sorry at 2850, an United Airlines sold 39.35 at 2650.
NEUT36|So I mean, those are our critical levels and the fact that he went on to say there's just no reason to own them.
NEUT37|So what's the point of just selling some of them made me say, I think that they very much are a microcosm of a big chunk of the US economy, not the world economy.
NEUT38|In some cases, he said.
NEUT39|And I came away thinking that the longer term story of comeback is very much in play, and that's not a lot of analysts thinking mean even this morning we only Dow Chemical Bank of America talking about a longer term decline.
NEUT40|Most of the animals are just trying to figure out whether it's going to be a very you still, I mean that the discussion that Warren Buffett that indicates that it say if anything a very long gated you or an L. And I know those things are shorthand and a lot of people might say what are you talking about?
NEUT41|It's just.
NEUT42|He just gave you what?
NEUT43|How about this?
BULL44|"No hope nearterm anybody agree with that?"""
