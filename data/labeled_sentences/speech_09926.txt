BEAR0|"""It's November 26, the weekend of Thanksgiving and going through our sectors we got one sector that's in an uptrend."
NEUT1|Here is the healthcare, but this represented by the Spider ETF you can see here, here and all along here it's been touching this support line and right now we got it right here, right at the support line, so we'd expect it to do something kind of like that.
NEUT2|So going into the individual stocks next, we look at McKesson, and this one is kind of at this support level down here.
NEUT3|It's not such a great thing because you got this big range right.
NEUT4|Here is all I see, so you can expect it to go.
NEUT5|This maybe back down.
NEUT6|It's kind of messy so not ideal.
NEUT7|Next we got Johnson and Johnson.
NEUT8|This is more of an ideal.
BEAR9|You can see the uptrend here.
NEUT10|And resistance kind of there just going along this channel with support their manned right here so it could come back down and bounce or come up and bounce.
BULL11|It's kind of in the middle with resistance resistance, but it's better than McKesson.
NEUT12|Next is Amgen with support here and here.
NEUT13|Now it can break out.
NEUT14|Kind of like this, but you got resistance up here near 180, but we got in this channel right here.
NEUT15|There's a huge range of money to be made, expected to kind of get resistance at 180, but if you look down here at 170 where it is now, you still got about $10 in there to make some money.
NEUT16|So it's it's a good one.
NEUT17|Next we got Humana.
BEAR18|You can see it's got this kind of general uptrend here.
NEUT19|This kind of range looking thing from about 2:30 to 260.
NEUT20|It's got support here and here and right here it's right at the support line, so it's pretty good probability.
NEUT21|Look for it to do something like that, but look for resistance in somewhere around 260 so I could come back down.
BULL22|But again, we got this pretty good $30 range, so that's a good range to make money in.
NEUT23|So that's it for now.
BULL24|"Thanks for watching."""
