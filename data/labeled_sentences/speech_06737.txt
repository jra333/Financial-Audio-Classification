NEUT0|"""Hey, this video is for Friday, February 24th, 2012."
NEUT1|Wanted to give a few pullback names to possibly get into along with some call options next week.
NEUT2|First, let's look at the SPY.
BULL3|You can see that we reached the one 3720 level intraday today.
BEAR4|We pulled back slightly and the previous level and this was one 3718 so.
BEAR5|You know, obviously we were expecting a pullback.
NEUT6|I've talked about in my last video and I also talked about how we need to be patient and how I was positioned for this.
NEUT7|For the short side.
NEUT8|But another thing that's interesting here that is the UUP, the dollar.
BEAR9|You can see that the dollar continues to fall.
NEUT10|So as the dollars following the market typically rallies and that's not been happening this past week.
BEAR11|You can see the dollar fell 123 you know out of five trading days this week.
BEAR12|CD4 the market fell so.
BEAR13|You could see that the dollar has now sort of broke this low and we're now we're down at the 200 day moving average.
BULL14|This should provide a little support for the dollar, if not a bounce, and that's my concern for the market.
NEUT15|'cause if the SPY can't seem to make new highs while the dollar is making new lows.
BULL16|And then the dollar would rally.
NEUT17|Then you know, I think a pullback probably happened, so we'll see how it plays out next week.
NEUT18|Again, we're consolidating.
NEUT19|Kind of up in the high sort of this little mini double top existing comes down.
NEUT20|You know.
NEUT21|I'm not expecting a big crash.
NEUT22|But again, you know, maybe a move to the 20 day or possibly this small gap fill around the one 33132 level.
NEUT23|So on a pullback though to names I'm interested in is Goldman Goldman Sachs in the financials.
BEAR24|You can see Goldman has had trouble at the 118 level, but now we're consolidating up there and we're also kind of above the 200 day moving average with the yellow 20 day moving average coming up.
NEUT25|So I think if you can get in around 1:14 or so with some call options, I would look at April at this point and I would look at either the 1:15 or 1:20 call options.
BULL26|I think if we can get above 118 then you got a pretty clear shot at 1:25 so.
NEUT27|That's one long play, another one I'm looking at is Disney, which already sort of broke this previous resistance around 41 and it's consolidating up here between this next level.
NEUT28|I think if you can get if we get some sort of pullback and get back in at the 20 year, or maybe if you want to get aggressive at the 41 level, look for a break of 42.
NEUT29|I think that you can get up to this 43 and a quarter level, so one more that I'm looking at is.
NEUT30|I BM.
BEAR31|IBM had a monster day yesterday and is now sort of, you know, taking a little bit of a breather got right up to the other 200.
NEUT32|You know, big round Number resistance.
BULL33|I think this consolidation here around the 195 would be a good place to get long if we get a pullback.
NEUT34|So if the market pulls back I would be looking to get in to IBM there and again.
NEUT35|If you're looking for you know directional options.
NEUT36|I would probably start looking at April options at this point since there's only about 20 days left in the March options.
NEUT37|That way you can get a little more swing out of it, so that's all I got for today.
NEUT38|"You guys have a great weekend and I'll catch you later."""
