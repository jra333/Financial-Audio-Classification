NEUT0|"""Sebastian is our resident expert with CBOE volatility index."
NEUT1|That's the VIX for short, which we then always explain is the fear gauge because it tends to rise whenever investors are freaking out, and that's exactly what happened last week when the average rolling over, although with stocks rise again today, the VIX pulled back.
NEUT2|This is important.
NEUT3|Keep that in mind for Sebastian.
NEUT4|The big question here is whether we're dealing with a volatility spike OK or a volatility swell.
NEUT5|Spike, swell Avix Spike is what happens when the fear gauge makes a hard move up out of nowhere and then gives it away almost as fast.
NEUT6|It represents a moment of panic that you gotta buy 'cause it quickly subsides avix well, on the other hand, is what happens when the volatility index slowly rallies over two to three week.
BEAR7|Usually while the markets rallying to that is almost always a bad sign because the Victor, the S&P 500, are supposed to move in opposite directions whenever you see them going in the same way it means the markets about to course correct.
BEAR8|If it's, well, the stock market eventually peaks, which sends the volatility index spiking still higher.
BULL9|Now if you want stocks to go higher than a VIX spike, well that is great news.
NEUT10|We've seen a bunch of these in the last year, and they tend to trigger some pretty substantial rallies like today.
NEUT11|OK, so let's look at this in a dispassionate way.
NEUT12|I want you to know how about that?
NEUT13|Was that a great chart?
NEUT14|I mean, I hope you took a picture of it and snapped it and send it to your kids and stuff like snap.
NEUT15|You know alright anyway.
NEUT16|Or maybe your parents got younger.
NEUT17|A lot of people watching.
NEUT18|Now, the.
NEUT19|We're going to do the SPR heard the volatility index to do some charting again.
NEUT20|It's going back to late night.
BEAR21|Last night there was a volatility spike in early June.
NEUT22|See this boom when the market experienced one farm owner of Covid panic.
NEUT23|I don't know what the hedge fund public came on right.
BEAR24|It was a hedge fund problem.
NEUT25|Rich rich hedge fund guy trying to keep you in your change right comes on scares people.
NEUT26|And then if you get a magnificent run and what happened here we saw something very similar.
NEUT27|That's what that Spike is.
NEUT28|We like spikes right?
NEUT29|In November we saw the same thing.
NEUT30|See the spike.
NEUT31|And then book OK. Have a nice run.
NEUT32|That's why Sebastes confident the VIX spike needs to be treated as a buying up to.
