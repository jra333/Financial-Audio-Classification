NEUT0|"""The view, yeah, I mean it looks are a couple of services out there and I'm not going to particularly name anyone."
NEUT1|Is it to add that some very nice people that have been very good at running stocks now running stocks is something that of course is illegal that.
NEUT2|He used to be the SEC used to look into these things and say, OK, well is someone doing a pump and dump scheme.
NEUT3|What is someone doing here?
NEUT4|I don't find that to be the SEC is is active as they used to be.
NEUT5|The things like that.
NEUT6|But you do have people running stocks an you know it's kind of like Confessions of a Unova St. Well when I talk about confessions of of a stream, my first book I talk about this what I see these people doing these things, which is that they pick a stock and they run it for the day.
BEAR7|And how horrible it is that they do that because you never know when they're going to be done.
NEUT8|And they catch people talk about less than they bag people.
NEUT9|They gun the stock and then they liquidate the stock into the people that they've gone to two.
BEAR10|And it's a process that is even made worse by Twitter.
NEUT11|I mean, Twitter's got guys bagging government, BGL, bagging, gunning and liquidating everywhere.
NEUT12|And so you gotta be really careful.
NEUT13|I mean there's a lot of people playing games right now.
NEUT14|The most I've ever seen.
NEUT15|I'm sure Dave would say, do I've never seen so many games played with stocks, which is that?
NEUT16|Hey, we're taking this one up today.
NEUT17|We're taking that one up today.
NEUT18|You know they used to do that in Japan in 89 and 90.
NEUT19|We know how that ended, so please be careful when you see a reference in Twitter which says we're taking up hurts or get on board the Chesapeake Train because these you're not going to be the one who makes the big money.
BEAR20|You could likely be the one who loses the big money and I just want to warn people.
BEAR21|I know, call people hate me for doing what I just said.
BEAR22|But, you know, people hated me for a lot of things.
NEUT23|"So just add that."""
