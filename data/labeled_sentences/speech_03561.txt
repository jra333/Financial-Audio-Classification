NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Guys go to your tactical traders and I just want to go over ticker symbol GOOG Now.
NEUT2|Currently we have Google on trendline bounce on the 50 SMAD right here around 1700.
NEUT3|Google did hit multiple times around the 1700 level where it did bounce and it just needs to get above this yellow line this 13.
BULL4|Ma an once it does that, then it will be considerably bullish to retest the highs around 1800 pretty easily.
NEUT5|Think it might even do it in one green candle, which is one day of price action.
BEAR6|Now when I come in a little bit closer on the four hour chart here, I see that the price did come and bounce down on the 200 SMH which is a good sign.
NEUT7|Which is this purple line?
BULL8|To continue the trend reversal to go back upwards.
NEUT9|Now what's going to happen here is that once Google has gotten above this 1750 line, it's going to run to about 1800 pretty quickly.
NEUT10|Now we have this 200 SMAD on the 30 minute time frame, and that is where the 1750 marker is, and so that our next day on Monday we're going to look for Google to.
NEUT11|Try and push the limits of from 1738 all the way up to 1750.
BULL12|I think it's going to follow this trend so middle over here is 1699 and it's continued to continue moving forward.
NEUT13|And with that being said, I think that 1750 is very easy to get.
NEUT14|I don't think that it's going to get denied here at this level considering looking at the daily chart on the longer term time frame I see that.
BULL15|Once Google has this area to get above the 1750, I think that the Bulls will start to step in.
BULL16|So going back to the daily chart I see here with the volume we did have a considerable amount of volume here on this day where we did have a bounce on the 50 SMAD and as people are starting to come in here, I think that this was a good opportunity and people knew it to get in and start to push this up a little bit further.
NEUT17|Now.
NEUT18|Where can this go from here?
NEUT19|I think it's going to retest that 1847 within the next week or so or by the end of 2020.
NEUT20|So maybe a few more days of price action we can at least get back up to 1800 and then push a little bit further up to 1850.
BULL21|I think that we can bounce here around the 50 SMAD and continue forward up to a $1900 price target.
