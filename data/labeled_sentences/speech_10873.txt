NEUT1|Your boy will say we talk about Moderna stock ticker symbol M RNA and I'll give you guys some key support and resistance levels to look forward to for next week on this stock and where I think price is going to go.

NEUT3|And also you can check out my Patreon link down below and I'm gonna show you guys why you want to be in at Patreon before I close it, 'cause I will be closing soon because once it gets to a certain amount of people won't get a handle anymore.
NEUT4|But I'll show you guys alive right now.
NEUT5|So let's get into the video.
NEUT6|So this was a key resistance.
BULL7|This was a case support that I gave you guys to look forward to.
NEUT8|As you can see it test it came back, ran through it.
NEUT9|Tested as a resistance.
NEUT10|Came back down through it.
BEAR11|It opened up above it, but like I said this is the key resistance to look how it aggressively dropped below this level.
BEAR12|It aggressively dropped the little level chase highways and then it keeps dropping.
NEUT13|So it's like he was dismissed and I give you a key support now.
NEUT14|This will tell you guys why you should.
NEUT15|I should be in a Patreon 'cause look how exactly on the dot this level is this level.
NEUT16|Was 102.65 and look at the low 102.66.
BEAR17|We were literally .01 cents off.
BULL18|Of the low and where I told you you would see a bounce in price very once sent off.
NEUT19|Like who do you know that is getting this close to price action exactly on the dot.
NEUT20|Not really too many people.
NEUT21|So like I said, is this key support and resistance levels.
NEUT22|I'm just trying to help you guys out so you guys can have a better opportunity in these trades so it rejected that.
NEUT23|Like I said it would.
NEUT24|And now we give you guys some key level to look forward to as it bounced it off this support.
BULL25|I actually see my brother stock going up.
NEUT26|I want to see if there's any resistance I'm gonna give you all this resistance.
NEUT27|Line the museum out a little bit.
NEUT28|OK, so this is a resistance level.
NEUT29|But I'm gonna give you all a closer term.
NEUT30|One 'cause I want to see how it reacts.
NEUT31|At this level, around 1:11.
NEUT32|So we want to watch this level right here.
BEAR33|So that's I do think price is going to go up.
NEUT34|I am getting bullish on Moderna so on Monday when it opens back up I will be looking for a quick scout play.
NEUT35|But I will send that alert on my Patreon page.
NEUT36|And I'm gonna see how to react at this level, so I'm going to scout in around 1:06.
NEUT37|I'm gonna exit around 1:11.
NEUT38|Damn wait, see how it trades in this range and when it breaks out of this range and comes back down and assess it as support, then I'll get on another call and look for the one 40s area.
NEUT39|But these are key levels you guys should look for Mr Key support and these are two resistance levels that I see now and if it falls below this support, which I'll see on Monday, then I'll give you guys a new support level, but right now I see this as a key support and I am getting bullish on Moderna stock.
NEUT40|So that is my outlook on Moderna.
