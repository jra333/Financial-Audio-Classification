NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol PLU G. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, I mean the the obvious, but I will anyway is just to establish some context here, but very impressive bounce on this one thing when you think about the fact that during that opening 30 minutes the price was all the way down here and now it's on the price.
BULL4|Have been able to battle back and close all the way up there like that.
NEUT5|Any rational person would say, yeah, that was definitely very impressive move, but that does leave the valid question, but is there any sort of true power behind this price point?
NEUT6|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT7|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT8|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
NEUT9|And that area is right down here at $36.25.
NEUT10|Now, why is that level important and helpful?
NEUT11|And I'm not saying that all this was going to actually happen by just for explanation.
NEUT12|Saying if the price were to come down here.
NEUT13|Behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT14|What would that do to the price?
NEUT15|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range of the chart where the price already was.
NEUT16|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sign a true power, true strength, or anything like that.
NEUT17|But you have the price, could manage to stay above that, you know level, that would be best because in that situation think about it.
NEUT18|If the price goes down there managed to stay above it and curls back upwards.
NEUT19|What's that all of a sudden doing for the price?
NEUT20|Well, that's giving the prices settle those there that would be given the price set of those right there.
NEUT21|And if you would.
NEUT22|Envision each of those losses.
NEUT23|Stair steps would have.
NEUT24|When I was upstairs up making progress in the upward direction, and that's the name of the game.
BULL25|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT26|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 3625 as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|Keep a very close eye on that purple line right there.
NEUT28|The 50.
NEUT29|Moving average currently valid at will call it 3875, so watch that very closely.
NEUT30|But All in all, that will be the next big battleground.
NEUT31|But yeah, very impressive bounce, not just a question of can the price build upon this bounce moving forward?
NEUT32|Let's see what happens.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird.
NEUT38|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT39|But in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT43|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT45|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT46|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT47|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT48|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT49|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
