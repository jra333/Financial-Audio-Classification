NEUT0|"""Here so can Tesla hold its charge moving forward."
NEUT1|Let's bring in Joe OSHA from JPM Securities who just hiked his price target on the stock to $788.00 and also Tim Higgins, a Reporter at The Wall Street Journal and a CNBC contributor.
BULL2|Thanks guys for being with us, Joe.
NEUT3|Let's start with you.
NEUT4|So this is a very fresh note.
NEUT5|The last time you put out a note on test.
NEUT6|I think it was mid November was a $516.00 price target.
NEUT7|What do you base this new valuation on this new price?
NEUT8|Target $788.00 a share.
BULL9|That's great.
BULL10|Well, thanks for having me on your help.
NEUT11|Pre she ate what we've done this morning is look at how many vehicles we think Tesla can sell in 2025.
NEUT12|That's been the basis for evaluation and we had been saying that we think Tesla can ship about two and a half million units.
NEUT13|We took that number to three this morning and that's based a on where we see the market for battery electric vehicles going and be where we see Tesla's competitive position.
NEUT14|So there were a few other tweaks but but that change was the major impetus behind the change to the price target.
NEUT15|And Tim Speaking of where Tesla is going, I think it's interesting.
NEUT16|You said in our in your notes to the show.
NEUT17|That said, I was like graduation day for Tesla, but more important than today, you say is the real importance came ahead of today in the run above excitement that they've been able to raise billions of dollars to create a war chest.
NEUT18|And you say that war trust chest is going to be the key to their success.
NEUT19|So tell us about that.
NEUT20|What do you see moving forward?
NEUT21|Yeah, well, one of the big problems for tests over the last few years, it's just having enough cash to pay for all of these ambitious goals that Elon Musk has set forward to get to those millions of sales.
NEUT22|Millions of production Tesla needs lots of factory room, and that costs a lot of money, and so we're seeing factories being built in Germany and in Texas, and that should help, but it still it still requires capital, and so that's been the big concern.
BULL23|What you have been able to do this year is raised a ton of money that should help.
NEUT24|Kind of fuel that growth in coming years.
NEUT25|Ann and Joe let me bring it back to you.
NEUT26|Do you think?
BEAR27|Certainly joining the SNP perhaps gives Tesla a bit more credibility, but the analyst community does seem quite split on the company.
NEUT28|I think I'll last I checked, a third were buys a third were holds in.
BEAR29|I think about a third roughly were also a cell, so analysts many still seems a bit split or divide it on the company.
NEUT30|Yeah yeah, and I, I think that's true.
NEUT31|By the way, I want to agree with the point that was just made about Tesla being much better capitalized, but look anytime.
NEUT32|You're in a situation where you're seeing an industry go through a major industrial transformation, which is what's happening now with the auto industry.
NEUT33|Things things can get a little weird.
NEUT34|I was covering Intel in the 90s when that business was in the process of wiping out the mainframe processor business and it it didn't seem like it was going to happen, and it seemed like the stock price was ahead of itself until it wasn't.
NEUT35|I was actually covering the film business in the 90s when digital photography wipe that out and I I do think.
NEUT36|We are in the midst of a similar transition now.
BEAR37|I think a lot of the incumbents are are grossly underestimating how quickly the world's auto business is going to go electric.
BULL38|And that's that's why we think Tesla over the next couple of years still has room to grow in terms of the stock price.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
