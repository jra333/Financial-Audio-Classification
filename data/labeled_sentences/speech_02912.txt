NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video traders today."
NEUT1|I'm looking at Facebook FB.
NEUT2|We're on the four hour 180 day chart here.
NEUT3|I just wanted to look at some of the big caps I haven't covered yet through the end of the year, especially tech stocks.
NEUT4|There's a lot of analysts are expecting tech to do well after the election here, but here's Facebook going back to the beginning of the year before the pandemic hit.
NEUT5|It was around two 10215.
BEAR6|With the crash, it fell down to 137, and we've pretty much been in this growth channel and above this growth channel since then, you know.
NEUT7|Just like all the other big name tech stocks, if they've done very well on the coronavirus, one thing at in this chart that looks a little different than some of those other bigger names is.
NEUT8|No.
NEUT9|Facebook.
NEUT10|Is his as.
BEAR11|Has been a little bit sort of lagging behind throughout this summer.
NEUT12|You know this is great to see.
NEUT13|We're outside of growth channel here.
NEUT14|But a lot of these other big text you know they they just flew out of their growth channels.
BULL15|They established highs, whether it was in in July or August, and they've been kind of consolidating back into those highs since then.
NEUT16|Not a lot of new highs recently, but Facebook.
NEUT17|They you know still very, very bullish growth.
BEAR18|In the summer here, but they kind of couldn't couldn't make it over this level had this big resistance line here that you know it's an uptrend.
NEUT19|But you know Facebook couldn't get.
NEUT20|Could get through this for a while bouncing off the back of the channel and then finally.
BEAR21|More recently, at the beginning of September, they had this high and they've been on the downtrend, just like most of the major stocks and the market as a whole has been on a downtrend.
NEUT22|For a couple of weeks or a month here.
BEAR23|But Facebook, unlike a lot of those other names that I've seen, almost all those other names, has already broken through the downtrend on their chart here.
NEUT24|Kind of.
NEUT25|Tested it for a few days, you know, broke through an established and then you know there's there's nothing up above it to stop it.
NEUT26|After that it got a nice little guy, so six point lift after.
NEUT27|After breaking through the channel here.
BULL28|So very bullish on Facebook.
NEUT29|You know, I think they were.
BEAR30|A little, a little lagging behind in the summer and.
BULL31|It's kind of worked out for them now.
NEUT32|They've sort of caught up and you know.
BULL33|They've already consolidated into this previous high another bouncing off the bottom of the channel and searching for more growth here.
NEUT34|So a little bit ahead of the curve.
BULL35|I'd say compared to some of the other larger tech stocks that we're seeing, so Facebook is definitely one to watch through the end of the year here.
NEUT36|Like to see them.
NEUT37|You know, press back up of the top of the channel and.
NEUT38|Maybe even see some new highs again here, but we'll see.
NEUT39|That's one to watch.
NEUT40|I just wanted to go through the chart with you guys before the election cycle gets going.
NEUT41|So you guys have this one on radar.
NEUT42|But thanks for watching.
