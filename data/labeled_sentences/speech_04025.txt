NEUT1|Phillip Bo has the latest film.
BEAR2|John, that news sent shares of Hyundai Kia moving lower in overseas trading and really two things came out in a regulatory filing that Hyundai Kia both companies.
NEUT3|Basically an identical filing for each company.
NEUT4|Two things came out, one is they say emphatically that a there is no discussion right now with Apple in terms of an autonomous vehicle program, here is the exact wording in the filing that was filed in South Korea.
NEUT5|Hyundai Motor is not in talks with Apple on autonomous vehicle development, so that's one part.
BEAR6|Which sent the shares moving lower.
NEUT7|The other aspect of this is that they also said in this filing.
NEUT8|Let's talk about Kia in it's finally it says Key is reviewing options for autonomous electric vehicles.
NEUT9|Hendaye saying no decision yet on a joint venture to develop autonomous vehicles.
NEUT10|So both companies indicating they are in discussions regarding this.
NEUT11|But their specific in saying those discussions at this point do not involve Apple.
NEUT12|Take a look at shares of Apple reached out to the company this morning.
NEUT13|Once again it declines to comment on these reports coming out of South Korea.
NEUT14|Regarding any discussions that may have been taking place between Apple in Hyundai Kia.
NEUT15|So for now guys.
NEUT16|That is where things stand with Hyundai Kia saying there are no current talks with Apple regarding in Apple Car guys.
NEUT17|Back to you.
NEUT18|Yeah, filled the verb tense matters here I think because I mean I've covered Apple for a long time and there have been instances where if a partner talks you know no more deal.
NEUT19|They didn't say they are not and have never been.
NEUT20|Is this a warning perhaps?
NEUT21|To future Python control Apple Partners.
NEUT22|Oh, I think it could be an.
NEUT23|I've talked with people who have dealt with Apple in the past and almost everybody says the same thing which is Apple wants to go on Apple's time.
NEUT24|An Apple wants to control everything as much as possible and look.
NEUT25|We were not the only ones last week who filed a report regarding Apple.
NEUT26|In Hyundai Kia there were others who initiated report or their own reports and which then raises the question.
NEUT27|Did Apple feel like look, this is *********** to the point where people are expecting an announcement.
NEUT28|One is not going to be happening anytime soon, so let's shut this down as much as possible.
NEUT29|Or did Hyundai Kia feel like OK?
NEUT30|Look, we know that Apple has been talking with other automakers as well, so let's make it clear that right now we're not in talks with them.
NEUT31|This is the second time, by the way, John and Carl.
NEUT32|This is happened the second time.
NEUT33|Remember back in January, there was an initial statement from Monday and then they came back and they said no, no, no we're not in talks.
NEUT34|Well now there are out today once again saying.
NEUT35|We are not currently in discussions with Apple.
