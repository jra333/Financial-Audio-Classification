BULL0|"""Did did some research and we came upon a study from Bitauto which is a leading e-commerce auto platform in China."
BULL1|And if you look at the results of this study, they actually show Neo's favorability ranking much higher than just about every automaker.
NEUT2|And this isn't just premium.
NEUT3|This is also mainstream.
NEUT4|So if you look at Tesla, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Cadillac, Audi, it's actually ranked higher than any of these brands.
NEUT5|And we think the fundamental driver for this is their focus on post purchase service.
NEUT6|So, for example, they have a battery swapping network.
NEUT7|They also have mobile truck charging.
NEUT8|Basically a combination of all these factors drives people to really appreciate the high level of service.
NEUT9|So the second reason is the reliability.
BULL10|There was actually a study published this month from JD Power that ranked Neo as the best and most reliable EV in the segment, and this was even higher than Tesla, so you know it's it's early to say right?
BEAR11|I mean that the volumes are still much lower than some of the competitors, but if we start looking at, you know the trends right now that that are appearing.
BULL12|It seems they're very well positioned and we think as more people hear about it, as more people drive their cars.
BULL13|As more people get in touch with the technology, it's going to drive further brand momentum.
NEUT14|And ultimately, you know, be up there with the likes of the German luxury players or Tesla your your price target now is what about $24.00 a share?
NEUT15|It's right now about 21 an where do you think it could end up?
NEUT16|I mean, is this a company that has the potential to grow to the scale of.
NEUT17|One of the big automakers or even Tesla, which is one of the big one of the biggest by market value, if not the probably.
NEUT18|Yeah, so I think the approach to this is a little bit different.
NEUT19|I wouldn't necessarily compare it to Tesla, they're not trying to.
NEUT20|For example, vertically integrate the battery supply chain, which I'm sure you know many people have have tuned in for last week.
NEUT21|There are much more focused on on the EV service software, the autonomous side.
NEUT22|So I don't think it's necessarily quote unquote.
NEUT23|The next test per say, but is it worth more than than it is right now?
NEUT24|I absolutely think scan it very quickly.
NEUT25|Can it be a global brand and not just a Chinese brand?
NEUT26|In other words, does it have that kind of scale quick 15 seconds please?
NEUT27|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT28|And they're going to launch in in Europe next year back up next year.
NEUT29|We think they're probably going to go into Norway, or one of those regions is very accommodative EBS and just just for a reference.
NEUT30|Their main competitor, Shelton, went to Norway earlier last week, my ancestral home.
NEUT31|My four birds, from from there, Edison.
BULL32|You thank you very much.
BULL33|Kelly, thank you.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
