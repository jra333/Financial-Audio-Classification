NEUT0|"""Covered many wild rides."
NEUT1|How does Bitcoin compare?
NEUT2|So Emily, you may not remember 'cause you're too young in the late 90s there was a magic 2 words called cash earnings and that was the arithmetic, so to speak, used to justify the valuations of somany.com companies that went public, of course, and one of them, by the way, was Yahoo.
NEUT3|Which came out in 1996.
BULL4|Has an IPO and appreciated 120 times its IPO price.
BEAR5|And then it fell almost 80% sound familiar?
BEAR6|Much of the NASDAQ, in fact, was a losing bet, right until the financial crisis didn't begin to recover until long afterwards.
BEAR7|So cash earnings Bitcoin.
NEUT8|There is comparison that I think is valid, which is that where people can't find standard ways to measure value otherwise known as intrinsic worth, they do all kinds of mental gymnastics to do that.
NEUT9|And Bitcoin is a really good example.
NEUT10|Of how everybody tried so hard to justify what it was doing when the closer they looked they couldn't find it.
NEUT11|No, they're there.
NEUT12|Even Warren Buffett said, you know, it's a joke.
NEUT13|So we've been in this picture before and I think the.com bubble that burst in 2000 is a good example.
NEUT14|Well, it took two decades to see the end of Yahoo story, and it never did quite recover.
NEUT15|This story asked the question, will Bitcoin recover?
NEUT16|Will it so?
NEUT17|You know, I'm not clairvoyant, and that that answer is way above my pay grade.
NEUT18|All I can do is, as an observer, really just a news man.
NEUT19|Look at this and say, alright?
NEUT20|What justifies the valuations that we see in the marketplace and when it's difficult to find the answers?
NEUT21|That's when you ought to be pretty cautious.
NEUT22|Do you see Bitcoin fitting into the broader story of volatility that's happening right now and tech volatility in particular?
NEUT23|Yes, to the extent that you know when you have volatility, it's another way of saying there's a lot of noise, and when there's a lot of noise, there's a lot of confusion, and when there's a lot of confusion and a lot of noise, people have difficulty finding the signals, and so where we are right now is the difficulty of finding the signals in so much noise, and the noise.
NEUT24|Unfortunately, I think.
NEUT25|Gets only louder, so let's talk about the signals.
NEUT26|Where do you see value in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency more broadly?
NEUT27|Or maybe it's just in blockchain.
NEUT28|I think the latter is exactly where there is value.
NEUT29|There's there's all kinds of excitement over blockchain because it is a technology that a tool that people can use in that in and of itself is where there's intrinsic value.
NEUT30|"So blockchain is something that I. I would spend a lot of time thinking about and its application."""
