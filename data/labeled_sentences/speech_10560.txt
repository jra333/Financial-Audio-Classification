BULL0|"""Pfizer did raise their guide CS 3:10 to 3:20 prior 3:00 to 3:10 an estimates 15 billion in 2021 Covid vaccine sales."
NEUT1|Yeah, so then people say, well, why isn't Pfizer up more?
BEAR2|Well this is the problem we had last night when I'm speaking to Thermo Fisher Mark Asper.
BEAR3|He was unwilling to be able to say, look the incredible numbers we've had there.
NEUT4|The gold standard, PCR maker, and vaccine maker including M RNA, the the technology he was reluctant to put up a big number, say listen, we're going to be able to duplicate that.
NEUT5|The reason why Pfizer can have such a big number and people aren't buying it.
NEUT6|Aside from the fact that they did have a missing some lines is that you really can't decide out with David Faber was saying earlier.
NEUT7|How long is this going to last?
NEUT8|David when JNJ comes up with something that could be a million 100,000,000.
NEUT9|I don't know 500,000,000.
NEUT10|We don't know how much they have and it's one shot then.
NEUT11|What it does is make it so that David it's very hard to predict how much visor can make going forward, and I think that's why people are looking at the stock and saying they're scratching their heads, but they shouldn't.
NEUT12|That stock represents the actual issue of a company that is really hostage to the pandemic growing.
BULL13|Yeah, I guess so.
NEUT14|But let's not forget they have a very broad product portfolio, don't they?
NEUT15|Gym that is not dependent at all on the progress they do.
NEUT16|Yeah.
NEUT17|But David, they're not.
NEUT18|They're not J&J, and they're not Eli Lilly.
BULL19|And, you know, look, I like them and I think they do a terrific job.
NEUT20|But again, David, we're really stuck with a company that's been doing a lot of financial engineering engineering, and who knows better than you about what Pfizer was trying to do it 1 growthpoint when they really were stymied about what to do next.
NEUT21|You are correct.
NEUT22|Well, they certainly looked at doing an inversion.
NEUT23|Of course.
NEUT24|Remember for quite some time any number of different deals and they did the Mylan transaction and you're right until running into sort of the positive one positive I guess from the virus as a result of their work on the vaccine, they've sort of suffered through a number of different things.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT26|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
