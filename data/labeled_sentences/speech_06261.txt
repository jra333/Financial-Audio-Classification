NEUT4|What I am telling people outside of immunities.
NEUT5|If you're watching this video.
NEUT6|By accident.
NEUT7|The empties already were buyers at the bottom here and sellers that hit our price target.
NEUT8|Our price target was $670 and they hit it and now we're doing quite the opposite because it's so overbought from our great trade down here at the 200 week moving average go to stockmarketfunding.com and look at all of them.

NEUT32|218 2012 665 foot because I'm overbought.
NEUT33|And I am taking the opposite.
NEUT34|When I took you on the journey from here to the sale, here is to sell and then make some profits on the pullback, and that the equity is overbought, but the equity will be buyable on.
