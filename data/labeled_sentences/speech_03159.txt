NEUT0|"""I'm interested in, of course what powered previously called mid cycle adjustment, not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts."
BEAR1|What is the market now anticipating because it hasn't budged in terms of still expecting 25 basis point cut come September?
NEUT2|Where are you seeing the rate of cuts and the extent of them going after that?
NEUT3|Well, I think we actually are likely to see and this is our forecast now.
NEUT4|Now it's really highly contingent.
NEUT5|Not that Brexit alone is a major event in and of itself, but in the context of the trade wars were seen and all the uncertainty.
BEAR6|We're seeing around trade situation there.
NEUT7|October 30th meeting ends on October 30th and if there depending on where we are, who knows or will be with Brexit by then.
BULL8|But I do think we could get that extra rate cut in October along with September.
NEUT9|Now if we do that with September, October and December we will have fully reverse all the Fed rate hikes of 2018 by the end of 2019.
NEUT10|I think that is what the Fed needs to do given the headwinds we do face, the uncertainties we face and that tax we're seeing hesitation by businesses.
NEUT11|And what the Fed is trying to do is offset the effects of that uncertainty by shoring things up.
BEAR12|"Now whether they can or not is another question, and I think it's also very valid that Chairman Powell went out of his way to say listen when we get to cutting rates for a recession, it's going to be more difficult 'cause we don't have as much room as we once had to stimulate."""
