NEUT0|"""Let's bring in our editor in Chief, that's Andy Serwer, because when Warren Buffett speaks, we all pay attention."
NEUT1|In his annual letter to shareholders, lot of issues there, Andy and one of the big ones was making the case for a stock buyback.
NEUT2|In his case, buying back his own stock.
NEUT3|Can you tell us more about how he's justifying it?
NEUT4|Yeah, well, basically he bought back almost $25 billion worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock in 2020.
BEAR5|And you know, buybacks have increasingly gotten a bad name at him.
NEUT6|And in fact, even Joe Biden was saying that this is something companies should be very, very wary of doing.
NEUT7|And the reason why is because it's actually twofold.
NEUT8|Number one.
NEUT9|First of all, it essentially means your timing, the purchase of stock.
BEAR10|An executive CEO's have done a terrible job, often buying when the stock is high, and then the stock goes down and they look like idiots.
NEUT11|And the other thing is actually it gives it advantage to the shareholder class at the expense of, let's say employees.
NEUT12|So in other words, instead of spending billions of dollars giving employees raises, you use that money to buy back stock.
NEUT13|And who benefits?
NEUT14|The top executives benefit more than anyone else, because their compensation is usually based to a large degree on the stock price performance.
NEUT15|And you've been covering Warren Buffett for years, and someone who is so closely watched here, not only by us journalists, but also by investors by retail investors as well.
NEUT16|When you take a look at and you impact this in your article here over the weekend, but I guess, what do you think it is when you drill down?
NEUT17|When you look into this fascination with Warren Buffett, what did you conclude just by so many people follow him so closely year after year after year?
NEUT18|Yeah, that's sort of what makes Warren Buffett special.
NEUT19|Shawna Ann, you know, I kind of came away with this one word, and that word is wisdom.
NEUT20|And then I was thinking, well, what is wisdom really?
NEUT21|Wisdom, of course, is being smart.
NEUT22|But a lot of people are smart and make bad decisions, so it's being smart and making the right choices, being right, and then the third element I guess would be being smart, making the right decisions and doing that overtime.
NEUT23|So that is wisdom and wise people in this country.
NEUT24|I would submit Shawna are not necessarily revered as they are for instance in other countries like China.
NEUT25|You know, we like our rogues and are Renegades.
NEUT26|So when someone becomes sort of a wise person.
NEUT27|A lot of people follow, but some people serve poo poo.
NEUT28|That and you see some of that with Warren Buffett.
NEUT29|"But I, I guess still a lot of people do follow."""
