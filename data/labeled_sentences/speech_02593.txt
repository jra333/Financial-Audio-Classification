NEUT0|"""I'm just debating if I should give me a cutey coffee."
NEUT1|I said with the water.
NEUT2|Alkaline water I wanna talk about.
NEUT3|Investment.
NEUT4|The smart money right now.
NEUT5|Is looking to scoop up things at reduced prices.
NEUT6|I'm taking this time right now to even expand my brand beyond just auction access, screaming and just give and get into other things that will help you live.
NEUT7|Help us all living better life, you know beyond money.
NEUT8|But today we're talking about.
NEUT9|Investment.
NEUT10|So Disney.
BEAR11|You know they've lost about what $65 billion in market cap already know last couple of weeks or so?
NEUT12|And other companies other blue chip stock companies.
NEUT13|Now I mentioned before about.
NEUT14|Investing money so you can, you know not have to work for every dollar, but your money is working for you.
NEUT15|This is where the real money is made in the world.
NEUT16|Buying cars flipping cars is nice, but that's frontin as frontline worker.
NEUT17|The real money is the investor behind that.
NEUT18|Alright.
NEUT19|So.
NEUT20|But I want you to take the time now.
NEUT21|Is this?
NEUT22|Do a little research on a couple of companies that you like.
NEUT23|You know that you may not have thought about buying stock before.
NEUT24|But perhaps you think about buying stock now, alright?
NEUT25|You know me not like iPhone.
NEUT26|You know I'm into Amazon, so I would buy those stocks.
NEUT27|Now.
NEUT28|Typically I wouldn't buy it individually.
NEUT29|But with an app called Stash, that's for iPhone, you able to buy stocks and five $10 per week increments.
NEUT30|Alright, I've been running, you know 15 dollars, $17.00 a week.
NEUT31|Water made it into my stash account.
NEUT32|You know for you know some time now, maybe 7-8 months.
NEUT33|But now I'm going to look out now.
NEUT34|Where I'm going to?
NEUT35|Take a portion of that money.
NEUT36|And start buying some stocks, perhaps Disney or Apple and Amazon.
NEUT37|Once I feel like there we've hit a bottom.
NEUT38|In the market, so take a moment.
NEUT39|If you haven't done so already, download Stash.
NEUT40|If you have iPhone.
NEUT41|If you're on Android, it's you can download something similar.
NEUT42|Robin Hood, Robin Hood.
NEUT43|So you're able to.
NEUT44|Set yourself up for.
BULL45|And larger increase a greater rebound.
BULL46|You know, greater rebound.
NEUT47|Don't focus so much on what's going on now, but focus on where you can be going later.
NEUT48|"Let's make money."""
