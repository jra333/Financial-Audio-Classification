NEUT7|To be perfectly honest, so let's get into the video.
NEUT8|OK guys.
NEUT9|So the world is moving to a kind of different future is starting to realize the impact of what we do for all these years.
NEUT10|For eating lots of meat and consumption iPod to eat a lot of edge.
NEUT11|I do eat meat though.
NEUT12|I only I don't even I don't.
NEUT13|I'm not, I'm not.
NEUT14|I don't even eat meat much.
NEUT15|My mom's largest heroin, but I I do.
NEUT16|I think high quality vegetarian meals are pretty nice, be less.
NEUT17|I had a Taco Bell kind of vegetable thing the other night with cauliflower in it and that was really nice.
NEUT18|So I do.
NEUT19|I do really understand this space I think.
NEUT20|And what kind of foods and people are looking for?
NEUT21|And I've been looking at some of the tattoo chest products and I've gotta say these are kind of meals.
NEUT22|I I would be at home.
NEUT23|They look.
NEUT24|They do look nice and I mean.
NEUT25|Even more juicy guys is a sales project projections.
NEUT26|This company is going public at $10 a share, so I haven't actually gone public.
BEAR27|$10 a share of signal over double that, and I think they've got a market crash around $1.2 billion.
NEUT28|But if they were gone and they this is OK.
NEUT29|So for Motors value company at 489 million, I think the company is currently around 1.65 billion.
NEUT30|They've got even more cells and beyond the meat did when they were public and there almost raining at $200 beyond the meat at the moment in 2021, the tattooed chef.
NEUT31|Is everything they can't be making around $221 million in revenue and I think there is easily surpassed.
NEUT32|I think this on my six $5 million they latest quarter.
NEUT33|They don't.
NEUT34|They're gonna crush.
NEUT35|Let's be honest.
NEUT36|I think I was really concerned.
NEUT37|His sales projections from them give it a few years there.
NEUT38|So I I can see it's not really going to the moon.
NEUT39|And if you're willing to hold it for that long and you will reap the returns.
NEUT40|I mean according to tattoo chest own, I mean tattoo shepherding service called into their investor presentation.
NEUT41|Give it seven cores.
NEUT42|In that sells, they should be trading around $221 a share.
NEUT43|If you come up there for comparing it to be on, meet some of the other competitors in the space and what their trading out there.
NEUT44|I mean beyond the meat there, but I think.
NEUT45|They are on the right path.
NEUT46|I meant I think tattoos careful going for a bit more, even more addressable market and beyond the meat.
NEUT47|They're really going for just the veg meals every simple to make this not loser cost, but it's also really good.
NEUT48|'cause when you used against supermarket now I think you just pick up sandwiches.
NEUT49|Pretty unhealthy and you just cook that in the microwave or or just in the oven for a few minutes.
BULL50|That tattoo, Schaeffer, really offering a healthy alternative.
NEUT51|So I really like the products and I really like the brands.
NEUT52|So yeah I I'm quite heavy in this stock is my second larger.
BULL53|Position in the my earlier.
NEUT54|She only bought it recently.
NEUT55|Like you setting this up, but I did sell it when they didn't get enough votes 'cause I was getting slightly worried about if they're actually going to get votes and if the merger was going to fall through this bit.
NEUT56|Too risky for me and I wanted just to wait and see what happens.
NEUT57|I but you know there now public mergers happens.
NEUT58|I'm about 7% in position so I really like the company.
