NEUT0|"""4th having it bag like I got 1 foot."
NEUT1|Hold your nose get this.
NEUT2|This is going to shock you alright I need you to think about buying Wells Fargo.
NEUT3|Yeah it has a new CEO.
NEUT4|He is smart.
NEUT5|He's honest, he's clever.
NEUT6|And by the way, he's funny.
NEUT7|I think the stocks worth buying here fellas name is Charlie.
NEUT8|Sure, if he's the new CEO.
NEUT9|He's kind of regular Raymond Shaw.
NEUT10|He used to run visa where he transformed the credit card company into a technological powerhouse.
NEUT11|Now I used to think Charlie myself was too intimidating to be the boss because of his no nonsense bearing.
NEUT12|Frankly, he always scared me, but you know what?
NEUT13|That's exactly what the broken Wells Fargo needs.
NEUT14|Why risk it?
NEUT15|Because despite all the banks misdeeds, the customers still love the darn thing.
NEUT16|While it will take time to clean things up, it's encouraging that the previous chairwoman, Elizabeth Duke, a lightning rod for the regulators, finally quit this week.
NEUT17|Allowing Charlie to install his own team both on the board and in the organization.
NEUT18|Why buy it now with the banks are so hated because after the stocks hideous decline that wells paying you to wait with the 7.5% yield by Son maybe goes to 8% by some sharp some service.
NEUT19|The real deal.
NEUT20|Not a big guys.
NEUT21|Nice guy.
NEUT22|5th.
NEUT23|We need a utility.
NEUT24|I like Dominion Energy letter D. It's a low cost power producer that also owns a liquefied natural gas export terminal in an era where many people believe that natural gas industries of corner.
BEAR25|And that's why it's going down more than other utilities domains told us over and over again.
NEUT26|They have ironclad contracts.
NEUT27|I actually believe him.
NEUT28|I believe Tom Farrell, he's the bankable CEO.
NEUT29|That's why it makes sense to me to reach for the five point 3% yield again.
BEAR30|I keep stressing.
NEUT31|It's not the bottom, it's the start.
NEUT32|Last, so you want to call them, but maybe you can get exactly at 7.28%.
NEUT33|I can't last six.
NEUT34|I want Attack Attack that's lever lever to an unassailable trim, which is 5G, and one of the best 5G places Qualcomm, which has a huge amount of intellectual property in every phone after days hammering.
BULL35|It still has a 3.8% yield terrific growth prospects.
NEUT36|I figured tomorrow slices right through four and a half, so I'm giving little prep four and a half.
NEUT37|It's a buy.
NEUT38|Before that.
NEUT39|No look.
NEUT40|I don't know when this breakdown comes to an end.
NEUT41|As I said, I will say again my.
NEUT42|Work that I've done says it's still gotta go through the S&P level of 2018.
NEUT43|It's not there yet.
NEUT44|We don't have a real stimulus plan in place washing.
NEUT45|We need one, but the bottom line, I think it's time to start buying a basket of high yielders accidental hog yielders.
NEUT46|And I'm suggesting UPS at the Verizon Wells Fargo Dominion.
BULL47|And then if Qualcomm goes down Qualcomm, they're going to be phenomenal payouts with good growth and solid balance sheets.
BEAR48|I like them so much and if they go down more you can just keep adding your position into weakness.
NEUT49|It's been done.
NEUT50|We did it in 2008 nine.
NEUT51|We crushed it.
BEAR52|These stocks actually do get cheaper as they go lower and in this unforgiving market.
NEUT53|That is all you can ask for.
