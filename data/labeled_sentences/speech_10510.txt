BEAR0|"""A beneficiary of what's been going on has been eBay."
NEUT1|We talked about it, but I wanted to mention it again, 'cause we're going to be hearing from the company CEO only second interview and exclusive here in the next hour, Jamie Inoni.
NEUT2|But take a look at shares of eBay.
BULL3|Kind of moving dramatically higher, even higher than its one time companion.
NEUT4|PayPal shares which Jim already went into.
BULL5|They had a very good quarter, a lot of people home.
NEUT6|They will use an eBay and they've got new people on there as well.
BULL7|Active buyers up 7% gross merchandise volume was 26.6 billion for the fourth quarter.
BULL8|That was up 21% or.
BULL9|On a reported basis and revenue up 28% both talk to him though about the future in particular.
NEUT10|The question of course is when you start to lap these comparisons over the period of time when everybody was at home.
NEUT11|Things Jim may not quite look as good.
NEUT12|I think you have to talk about that.
BULL13|The deepening seller base, buyer growth, superior execution.
BULL14|We know that management is coming down a good job.
NEUT15|E-commerce of course is something that's very important for everybody.
NEUT16|We haven't talked about, say Ralph Lauren E Commerce and we haven't talked about the idea that e-commerce and what's going to happen with the big game this weekend.
NEUT17|But I will point out David.
NEUT18|They called out sneakers and watches sneakers or something.
NEUT19|People trade the way that I used to think we traded trading cards, but it's a very profitable business.
NEUT20|I think you don't have to ask him about particular categories.
NEUT21|And by the way, Europe has always loved eBay, so I remember when people said as you were mentioning sell PayPal because it was going to eBay business and this is the similar year for that an by eBay.
NEUT22|Well clearly that was wrong, but I think that eBay under this management David has a very good call on what the consumer wants to do at home.
NEUT23|Maybe they're bored and when they're not bored, people will do something else, but right now I just flat out good quarter, gave just a flat out good quarter.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
