NEUT0|"""You know we're long term investors, so when we look at Tesla we see as a company."
NEUT1|It's three years ahead on battery technology.
NEUT2|Three years ahead on autonomous hardware versus competitors and three years ahead and autonomous data because it's the only company collecting data from its customers, so that's that's the Tesla story that remains unchanged in terms of this settlement.
BULL3|We're certainly glad to see that Musk is staying on as CEO, especially for full autonomy, which we think is the biggest opportunity ahead of Tesla is good that he stays on until they get there.
NEUT4|What about the fact that he's no longer chairman?
NEUT5|Two independent directors?
NEUT6|Is that in your case, which is bullish anyway?
NEUT7|Is that the sort of perfect outcome he is CEO?
NEUT8|But he's going to get some extra kind of guidance and restrictions, maybe from from what he's been able to do in the past.
NEUT9|You know, I think certainly other investors would like to see that that there might be some extra guidance.
BULL10|Certainly you know some more guidance over Twitter, but but in terms of what we think, you know, Musk is a visionary, so we're happy.
BULL11|We think he's proved himself in that sense.
BULL12|We're happy that he's staying on so the vision is out there.
NEUT13|You guys are kind of.
NEUT14|I bought into it.
NEUT15|You say there are three years ahead on all of these kind of big picture movements, essentially, and the forces behind them.
NEUT16|But to bridge their way to that point when they can capitalize on an autonomous driving world, they have to sell cars, they have to raise capital.
NEUT17|They have to do all these things along the way.
NEUT18|So have you got more or less confidence that they have the ability to hit all those signposts at this point?
NEUT19|Well, when you look at the numbers so Tesla right now has over 80% market share for EV's in the US, The Model 3 is the top grossing car.
NEUT20|In the US, so so really tells reached escape velocity.
NEUT21|I mean, even if Musk were to disappear tomorrow, the company is there, it's set up to do well.
NEUT22|We're happy that he's staying, certainly, but the story is set up so you have no concern about valuation, cash flow, cash burn, long term profitability.
NEUT23|I mean, these are the long list of the short sellers complaints that nothing in this settlement was done to remedy any of those bigger picture concerns, sure.
NEUT24|So if we touch on cash when you look at cash.
BULL25|For the China Gigafactory we know that Tesla is going to use local money to fund that for any other cash needs, we'd actually be happy if Tesla were to raise additional money.
BULL26|In fact, we factored in a 10 to $20 billion raise in the equity markets and we'd be happy with that because we just want them to get to scale and again to reach full autonomy.
BULL27|"'cause we think that's the largest opportunity given a Thomas Dr. And we think that in the next five years the stock could actually go to 4000."""
