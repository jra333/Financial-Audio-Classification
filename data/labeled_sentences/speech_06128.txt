NEUT0|"""After a friendly meeting with President Obama at the White House to discuss a transfer of power, president elect Donald Trump is now planning to change the way Washington does business and handles your money."
NEUT1|Does this mean that America will be open for business soon after Trump is inaugurated?
NEUT2|Forbes Media chairman, Mr Capitalism himself?
NEUT3|Steve Forbes joins us now to weigh in.
NEUT4|Wouldn't it be wonderful if we get back to a capitalist model that rather than something in between socialism and capitalism?
NEUT5|Yeah no, third way the right way?
NEUT6|No third way alright.
NEUT7|First question has to be very personal.
NEUT8|If you are tapped to be Treasury Secretary or Treasury of Commerce or something else in this administration, would you accept?
BULL9|Well, I'd be very flattered, but I think I can play a very constructive role as an activist journalist on the outside.
BULL10|But we're going to be supportive whatever way.
NEUT11|I'm not ruling it out.
NEUT12|We're not ruling, they're not ruling it out of.
NEUT13|I'll be supportive, but something about Commerce sector.
NEUT14|A lot of people say Commerce really doesn't do that much.
NEUT15|And and there was one guy got aid Commerce.
NEUT16|Yeah, right?
NEUT17|Well, well.
NEUT18|You could be if you were Secretary of Commerce.
NEUT19|You could actually eliminate your own agency.
NEUT20|Wouldn't that be nice to to have see?
NEUT21|So the seeds of destruction within the Commerce Department?
NEUT22|Well, I proposed that when I ran 20 years ago and is Ronald Reagan said there's nothing more immortal than a government agency.
NEUT23|You gotta get Congress and they have a lot of other things I gotta get done, David, particularly on the tax side to get this economy moving again rather than restructuring government itself that will come later.
NEUT24|First things first, gotta show people this country is back on its feet.
NEUT25|One thing that is happening you look at what's happening with gold over the past couple of days.
NEUT26|The gold trade is gone.
BEAR27|Way down, goal was off over $40 today.
NEUT28|It's it's off about.
NEUT29|I guess it's about close to $100 off since since what's happened since the election itself, is there a belief that the Federal Reserve in particular may lead the way to normalizing our crazy interest rate experiments around the world that have have really heard a lot of people?
NEUT30|I don't know if the Fed is smart enough to have read the election returns.
NEUT31|Donald Trump did take some pokes at it during the campaign, which is good.
BEAR32|The Fed is messed up.
BEAR33|As you say, the credit markets so that small and new businesses can't get the credit they need to mention retirees living Irene wages.
NEUT34|Life insurance companies are being hit hard, pensions are being hit hard, so let's have free markets again with interest rates.
NEUT35|Well, one thing that bothers some free marketeers about Donald Trump is his views are his views on trade.
BULL36|Today we got word that the congressional leaders have told President Obama they will not reconsider the the Pacific trade deal known as TPP again.
NEUT37|Is TPP dead?
NEUT38|Is NAFTA dead?
NEUT39|All of the agreements, some of which were done with Republican input.
NEUT40|Are they all dead now?
NEUT41|Certainly TPP is dead as it is now been negotiated.
NEUT42|And since Hillary Clinton had come out against it, there's no way to resurrect that body.
NEUT43|So they're going to revisit it next year.
NEUT44|One of the things Trump could do on the trade front.
NEUT45|That sounds a little counterintuitive is to start negotiating with the Chinese about stabilizing the one against the dollar.
NEUT46|So no devaluations, revaluations, none of that stuff.
NEUT47|Fix it and so therefore no more games.
NEUT48|Kind of leverage would we have on that.
NEUT49|The fact that we're back in business, the fact that we're going to be sending the Navy too close to those of man-made islands to show that South China Sea is not a Chinese Lake.
NEUT50|It's international waters.
NEUT51|So when they see that we're serious about doing things, I think they want to know, they'll be ready to negotiate.
NEUT52|Steve Forbes.
BULL53|We hope we hear a lot of you from inside.
NEUT54|Perhaps the administration, but you say you do just as well outside.
NEUT55|Well, with you guys.
BULL56|"How can one lose Steam for is great to see you."""
