NEUT0|"""A Bloomberg Terminal is something that is used by professional economists, often in a finance related role, and it shows Live prices of things like equity shares or stocks or currency fluctuations."
NEUT1|As a University, we have access to this just slightly delayed, so we can't actually gamble any money on it, but it shows students that the real world application what is going on right this second and we can use that data to directly add some value on the theory that we teach so we can find out information about stocks and shares about businesses but also trays and commodities.
BULL2|"This is a real benefit for students when they graduate mainly because they are able to see economics live in action now, but also the job that the students might be going to might actually be using some of this software so they're already familiar and they would have already had that Bloomberg certificate to show that."""
