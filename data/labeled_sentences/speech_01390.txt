NEUT5|It really helps out this channel.
NEUT6|OK, so the two stocks that I'm interested in #1.
NEUT7|Disney, so why mention Disney right now?
NEUT8|I think that Disney has a lot higher to go from here.
NEUT9|I think that Disney stock at a baseline right now she's betraying around 1:50.
NEUT10|Well, why is Disney training a little bit lower right now?
BEAR11|I think Disney I think people were a little bit disappointed in this latest Star Wars and the revenue that is generated from that movie.
BULL12|So I think this could be a good opportunity to buy into this company because of this disappointment in this slight pullback that's happening right now.
NEUT13|Other things about Disney is that their Disney Plus is a really good opportunity.
NEUT14|Here is it's capturing Netflix like opportunity in addition to getting that theme park that Disney has and all of these different aspects of Disney's business model come together and strikes each and every individual in a three pronged attack.
BULL15|It's brilliant.
NEUT16|So that's one stock.
NEUT17|I'm really interested in right now.
NEUT18|The second stock or more of a group of stocks.
NEUT19|I'm going to talk about the exact stock that I'm buying right now, but the group of stocks I'm interested right now and there's actually a couple of stocks imaged in this sector, is airlines.
NEUT20|So airlines have been having a really tough time right now, and if you don't believe in airlines right now, maybe you want to buy oil, for example, because it's kind of the converse.
BEAR21|So Boeing has made all the airline stocks go down because of the Max Debackle, but in addition to that it was happened just in the last training day.
BEAR22|Was the conflict overseas and that caused oil prices to spike and also cause airline prices to crash.
NEUT23|So airlines is a good opportunity right now.
NEUT24|In my mind, in terms of it's a good option to buying this dip.
BEAR25|Buying this weakness, especially if you think oil price is only going up temporary like the last conflict where there was some attacks done in Saudi Arabia.
BULL26|And if you think that only cause the oil to go up for a few days, I think that oils being spiked up right now for a temporary spike just like in the last conflict, we're going to see airlines rebound and in addition to that again the Boeing Max of bottle have class realize this stuff so much.
BULL27|More airlines are already in attractive valuation.
NEUT28|Alright, let me have you guys think about those two stocks.
NEUT29|If you guys also agree with my airline buying right now and if you guys think that you shouldn't buy airlines right now and one of those reasons why you shouldn't be buying airlines right now.
BULL30|Well, thanks for watching.
BULL31|"Hope this video is interesting and I'll see you guys next time."""
