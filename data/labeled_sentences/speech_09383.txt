NEUT0|"""Tomasa as an investor in this company, now I know one of the things you've come on CNBC, and talked about."
BULL1|The past is how impressive the gross margins are.
NEUT2|Given the fact that service hasn't actually started yet, how are you thinking about those gross margins when it does?
NEUT3|And what does that mean for profitability for this company?
BULL4|I think the profitability of this business is going to look as good as one of the best software companies around, and that's why I was so excited.
NEUT5|You're in the business of hardware, but it looks like software and that is very different than many of the other technology oriented hardware companies that have gone public recently.
NEUT6|So this is a business that at scale.
BULL7|Will have almost 70% operating margins, which is incredible, and it's a testament to, you know, the billion dollars that Richard has invested before I came here and then the team that George is built that's been able to build something that is largely now dearest and ready to commercialize and monetize.
NEUT8|What do you think, especially now that there's going to be quarterly earnings reports?
NEUT9|What do you think investors are going to hear from this company?
NEUT10|Leaves Me 2 vectors that can really going to matter.
NEUT11|The first factor is that describe the demand.
NEUT12|So there are already 600 plus customers that have paid $80 million about 120,000,000 of future business.
NEUT13|There's three or 4000 more after today.
BULL14|I suspect they'll be many more thousands after that who want to give us money, and so I think understanding that demand will be really important for people to get comfortable around the long term projections.
NEUT15|"And then the second is about George's execution ability and his team's path to getting these rockets in the air on a more and more frequent basis."""
