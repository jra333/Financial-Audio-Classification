BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This weird video chart on ticker symbol AAPL.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT3|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT4|In case maybe new charts instead of using these candle sticks here, representing one days worth of price action, which is what you would normally see, each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT5|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT6|It's actually today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT7|I like do this.
NEUT8|Time Frame is a good job of telling the quote unquote story of the price and in this situation makes mapping out a very logical question quite straightforward and a question that I have.
NEUT9|And I should note for that from disclosure perspective, I do own Apple from the long side in my retirement accounts.
NEUT10|So from like a set of disclosure standpoint, keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
NEUT11|So yeah, the question that and this is not like a question unique to me.
NEUT12|I'm pretty sure a lot of people are wondering this, 'cause there's no doubt about it that the question revolves around the fact that from where the price was on Thursday at its lows to where it closed on Friday.
BULL13|Today, the price made a very nice bounce.
NEUT14|I think any rational person would agree with that, but that does lead to the question of.
NEUT15|But is there any sort of true power behind this?
NEUT16|This price movement is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT17|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT18|I have no idea, but like I said by using charts we can make mapping out that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves around this area right here at 1:45.
BULL19|Y is 145 important will hopefully we can agree on the logic that price movements with genuine strength with true power the price is going to progress forward.
NEUT20|The price is not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT21|I'm assuming you're saying thanks, Captain obvious.
NEUT22|Of course if a price movement has true power, it's not going to go back to where it was.
BEAR23|That would be a total contradiction.
NEUT24|Exactly, I agree.
NEUT25|So with that in mind, think about 1:45.
NEUT26|Any sort of breaks below there were set up.
NEUT27|The price separates of the downside.
NEUT28|What would that be done with the price that would literally be put in the price right back inside of that range of the chart where it just broke out from again going back?
NEUT29|Not a sign of true strength.
NEUT30|Let's say the price did pull back here, but in this situation behave like that before starting to work its way back upwards.
NEUT31|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT32|Well, you have a set of those right there.
NEUT33|You would have those lows down there if you envision each one of those is stair steps.
NEUT34|Well hey, now you have stair steps starting to make progress in the upward direction and again.
NEUT35|That's the name of the game.
NEUT36|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL37|Overtime, it's going to make progress forward and again in this situation.
NEUT38|I'm just quantifying that term.
NEUT39|Make progress as 145.
NEUT40|As far as levels of resistance are concerned next week.
NEUT41|Key one that I'll be keeping an eye on.
NEUT42|It's going to be that purple line up there, which is the famous 50.
NEUT43|Simple Moving average keyword moving so I'm not going to sign a numerical value to it 'cause it is going to move in.
NEUT44|Change with time.
NEUT45|Yeah, right now that's one 5133.
BEAR46|But again, because that line moves, that value will change and drop as next week plays out.
NEUT47|But anyway, you look at it.
BULL48|Very nice bounce today on the Bulls part.
NEUT49|Not just a question of can the Bulls build upon this momentum.
NEUT50|Next week we will see.
NEUT51|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT52|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT53|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT54|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT55|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT56|It's completely free.
NEUT57|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT58|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
