BEAR0|"""Ha yeah, look at this nasty short down that is so gross and the level 2 they're still doing it."
BEAR1|They're still doing it still getting shorted.
NEUT2|I mean look at this 1377 thirty one that same 5 cent spread.
BEAR3|We've had the entire freaking day.
NEUT4|That's insane.
NEUT5|That shorters man, that's shorter, so it's he you guys can't make this up.
BEAR6|I know there's gonna be those people are like haha you are wrong, you are wrong.
NEUT7|There's no manipulation happening.
NEUT8|Tell me why this makes sense?
NEUT9|Why would you have supported you have these same size sellers?
NEUT10|1 penny increments apart from each other.
NEUT11|Set up the entire freaking day.
NEUT12|This needs to be 8 entire video for itself.
NEUT13|You want to see what you wanna see?
NEUT14|What short selling looks like?
NEUT15|You know it's looks like it's this.
NEUT16|This is Nick this is.
NEUT17|This is why we got some crazy stupid this bless our exists because this sort of stuff happens on the ask what's going on right?
NEUT18|You could slap the ask as a shorter and you don't want to buy.
NEUT19|Are you going to dump 4000 shares into the market?
NEUT20|As you're seeing right here, the instant that hits that price and it can't can't catch up it can't catch its breath.
NEUT21|The stock can't go out because it's just meeting these freaking 4000 size shares 567 cents apart from each other the entire day.
NEUT22|This is a little bit going on since back here right?
NEUT23|Since way up here.
NEUT24|This is been going on for freaking 4 hours for four hours.
NEUT25|You have the same size, 5 cent spreads across from each other.
NEUT26|That's nuts.
NEUT27|How is this even possible?
NEUT28|How can people do that?
NEUT29|Because you could have just two hedge funds.
NEUT30|Want to hedge funds?
NEUT31|Doing this is to have 3000 size bam.
NEUT32|Put that one point across from each other.
NEUT33|$0.05 bread, whatever the price is, just set your computer and you can sit back and go like this.
NEUT34|You can sit back and go like this and be like Yep good to go.
NEUT35|Don't gotta worry about it.
NEUT36|That's why the freaking the sort still matters because it can't do that.
NEUT37|People would tell me and I've had this conversation with people.
NEUT38|Why is the short film and I don't feel like it does anything.
NEUT39|It does look at this look at this.
NEUT40|What does that tell you?
BEAR41|God that shouldn't be legal.
NEUT42|It should be legal man.
NEUT43|Just insane.
NEUT44|I get so heated about this stuff.
NEUT45|Honestly I am so passionate about AMC.
NEUT46|I got into this.
NEUT47|I'm going all in not even because of the money that opportunity, right?
NEUT48|I think we're making a crap ton of money.
NEUT49|I really do but I got into this because this is just freaking stupid like the manipulation in the craziness, the transferring of wealth in the 9% of 1% that people have really been making money for the entire existence of the market in America is nuts and nobody gives a **** is nuts.
NEUT50|It doesn't make sense.
NEUT51|I wanna be a part of the change.
NEUT52|Want to be on the right side of the coin and you can see it right now.
NEUT53|How is this?
NEUT54|How is how is that possible?
NEUT55|'cause you know what that is?
NEUT56|That's just people as people getting their money stole from them.
NEUT57|That's the institutional investors saying.
NEUT58|Look at this, I've got a computer that's just going to sit here and I can look at my screen for seven hours and watch you guys lose money while his bleeds.
NEUT59|And you can't do a freaking thing about it.
NEUT60|Because guess what, you're in the price up.
NEUT61|We're going to match you with 5000 shares.
NEUT62|Literally 1 penny across from wherever you're going to buy it at insane.
NEUT63|Shorting was created because you think the stock will drop.
NEUT64|It wasn't created, lower the price exactly.
BEAR65|Matthew, you hit it right on the head.
NEUT66|You hit it right on the head.
NEUT67|It shouldn't be like that.
NEUT68|Shorting was meant to correct the market.
NEUT69|If you think it's going to go down right, it's an opportunity for you to ride the wave.
NEUT70|It's inequalites equalizer, right?
NEUT71|It's not about to bankrupt companies.
NEUT72|Short amount of bankrupt companies.
NEUT73|It's meant to level the market.
NEUT74|If something is overvalued, you short it because you think it's going down.
NEUT75|If something is undervalued you long it because you think it's going to go up.
NEUT76|It's not meant to bankrupt companies.
NEUT77|It's being abused, right?
NEUT78|It's being abused, it's insane.
NEUT79|It's insane.
NEUT80|Doesn't make any sense.
BEAR81|Every time I look at this level to get ****** *** because that is so dumb.
NEUT82|You don't even you don't you do not have to know a single freaking thing about the market.
NEUT83|And if you watch the market, the level twos for seven hours in one straight day, you would know that this is messed up, that it should not work like that.
BEAR84|It's so freaking dumb, so dumb.
NEUT85|"How do you feel about?"""
