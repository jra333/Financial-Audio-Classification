NEUT0|"""At big name billionaires like George Soros and John Paul Tudor Jones, they're betting against stocks saying in many cases just sell a ball."
NEUT1|Forbes Media editor in Chief Steve Forbes is with us along with Ashley Webster and Elizabeth MacDonald, right?
NEUT2|Steve.
NEUT3|We got all these top guys.
NEUT4|Billionaires are Gogo and they're saying get out of stocks.
NEUT5|What do you make of that?
NEUT6|Good?
NEUT7|That's their money.
NEUT8|It's their money.
NEUT9|That's true that my money.
NEUT10|Well, do you agree with it?
NEUT11|No, I think market timing.
NEUT12|If they can do it, God bless him or their customers.
NEUT13|Bless them.
BEAR14|But trying to time these things now historically Stewart the first year of a new president is bad for stocks, no matter is Democrat or Republicans.
BEAR15|Usually a rough year.
BEAR16|Always disappointment after the election.
NEUT17|So if there are timing that just on base of history for next year, yeah.
NEUT18|But they also got have to say even though it's George Soros we got a little substance on their side.
BEAR19|Earnings have been flat, business investment is not good.
NEUT20|So look around the world.
BEAR21|Khan Academy is not doing well productivity here.
BEAR22|Not good.
NEUT23|You have a lot of financial engineering still out there.
BEAR24|the Fed is still misbehaving.
BULL25|So are the stocks have done well.
NEUT26|But the idea of timing the market sell at the high on the expectation that is going to go down and you will buy back in again.
NEUT27|That's a game that's been tried by countless generations of people, largely unsuccessfully with viewers.
NEUT28|Especially if your retirement money.
NEUT29|Yeah, don't try to be George Soros.
BEAR30|You'll end up losing.
NEUT31|Just go back quickly to March 2009.
NEUT32|World falling apart.
BEAR33|Worst bear market in generations 5th down 54%.
NEUT34|How many people got back into the market and a lot of people got out during the bear market.
NEUT35|How many got in March 2009 and missed this big part of this huge rise less we forget even if we get out in time doesn't mean you're going to get back yet, but we should tell everybody.
BEAR36|In March 2009, the Dow Jones average went down to 6500.
NEUT37|Yes, Fast forward to its 18,500.
NEUT38|So if you didn't get back in.
NEUT39|Back in the day, you missed out on one big big rally.
NEUT40|Every investors a disciplined investor until the market goes down.
NEUT41|"Is that right?"""
