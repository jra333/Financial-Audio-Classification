NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol SND X we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|You're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link, so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT3|Very nice movement today, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs on this one going forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal loan if they play one.
BEAR7|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would affect the price gap or above that round Number of $9.
NEUT8|Now.
NEUT9|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 9.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or anything like that, but you have the price.
BULL11|Could manage step above that area.
BULL12|That would certainly be a massive sign of power.
NEUT13|Going forward, taking a step back and look at this from more so the broader you know bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as next week plays out, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, so a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT17|That right there I'm defining as the move.
NEUT18|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT19|As long as the price stays above that line as the land itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT20|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT21|Everything must visualize that.
NEUT22|That is what is being represented again.
BULL23|Yeah, staying above 9 would be great.
NEUT24|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart.
NEUT25|What about levels of resistance going forward?
NEUT26|Well, at this point it's really just a question of where the party finally stopped today.
NEUT27|So red for resistance and party stop late afternoon.
NEUT28|Final basically hour of the day, right up there give or take around $10.35 so 1035 will be Public Enemy number one headed into Monday on.
NEUT29|Although anyway look at it.
NEUT30|Fantastic volume today, very nice volume or excuse me.
NEUT31|Very nice price reaction with that volume and now it's definitely more than valid question to wonder, you know, is this the start of something bigger?
BULL32|So yeah, let's see if the price can build up on this momentum next week.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird.
NEUT38|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT39|But in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT43|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT45|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
