NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up guys doesn't get here from initiative trading today we're looking at Disney."
NEUT1|You can see ever since February just a nice little stair steps up up up.
BEAR2|Finally lost a little bit of steam.
NEUT3|Went up above.
BEAR4|Hit that 204 market and BAM, just consolidated right back down and we're down here below 200 again.
BULL5|Going forward we're going to have to see a nice clean break.
NEUT6|An hold of the 200 that's our next big level.
NEUT7|That's it right there 200 then we go 204.
NEUT8|Then we'll go to 10.
NEUT9|That's how it's gotta be.
NEUT10|But yet are stochastics are still for some reason over bottom.
BEAR11|Here almost are our size neutral bar sticks are still way high.
NEUT12|So we need everything just kind of consolidate a little bit more.
NEUT13|I know it's going to be boring and choppy in here, but we need everything to lighten up a little bit before we get a nice move, either up or down will take either one.
NEUT14|We just need to consolidate 1st and then we can actually make our decision there or make our assumption on which direction this stock will end up going for initial trading.
NEUT15|"I'm doesn't get to you guys."""
