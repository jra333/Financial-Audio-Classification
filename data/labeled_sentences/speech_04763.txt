NEUT1|Hey this is was this was a supporter.
NEUT2|Looking at this is pre market in the Mac.
NEUT3|Unfortunately you cannot see the error very clearly in the PC.
NEUT4|This area is usually great.
NEUT5|So anyway this with all these little dots this is the premarket aftermarket market.
NEUT6|And then right here at the opening soon as you open.
BULL7|Healthy 30-40 maybe good volume popped.
NEUT8|Started running for the good good trader here.
NEUT9|Pull back.
NEUT10|This is what you want to see on a pullback that holds the DWP.
NEUT11|This other line as well as the moving averages the order.
NEUT12|The moving averages.
NEUT13|31 simple moving average.
BEAR14|The Gray line consolidated and came down a little bit rested with the support resistance at 16 eighteen 65 I believe 68 one in this area you see better on the daily chart.
NEUT15|This is the one miniature.
NEUT16|So summarize about this area and then the only cross above the moving averages price followed by crossing the WPA moving averages and from that point on this was like a breakout.
BULL17|Data with good volume start picking up a little bit here and again the DWP crossing the moving average.
NEUT18|This was a key place price started to hold all the moving averages.
NEUT19|Very WP and then moving forward it basically started forming a little bit of a.
NEUT20|Consolidation of rising channel.
NEUT21|You see, there was resistance here at 1937.
NEUT22|The high point of this day.
NEUT23|When they break out the area needed to hold.
NEUT24|OK. And then this is the potential for rising China.
NEUT25|Here's some of the laws.
NEUT26|We see here some here, some here and then you see what it does.
NEUT27|Move forward and you know the position a little bit.
NEUT28|Help the 50 simple moving average and most importantly desire here until nineteen 3437.
NEUT29|So then we started creating the rising channel after the break out.
NEUT30|Is your father well?
NEUT31|He reached a trend line, is straight line right here?
NEUT32|I'm gonna show you in a moment and this is the place where they take profit.
NEUT33|They were large sellers and this is, you know it's a trend line on a daily chart.
BULL34|It's nearly a place of profit and in fact moving forward price basically consolidate and then we can do a little bit into the clothes, but nevertheless still a positive, positive close.
NEUT35|Considering today in the market today was a little bit of a bearish market, so let's look briefly at the.
NEUT36|Daily shark which is.
NEUT37|You can better see what I was talking about, so this is the trend line I was referring to when prices reach their area.
NEUT38|There was a plastic Prophet looking back.
