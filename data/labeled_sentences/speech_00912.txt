NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back another video today it is your boy will today I'll be talking about Transenterix stock.
NEUT2|I know I'm saying that wrong ticker symbol TRXC now give you guys some key levels.
NEUT3|Some analysts also forecasts of where I see the price going and also the level that I want to buy at.
BULL4|OK as you guys know they had this good run up but as it runs up I'd like to see that pull back.
BULL5|And we did get a little bit today, but I want to see a more pull back.
BULL6|So it closed around $5.79 and it is up a little bit after hours.
NEUT7|So we have to see how it opens up tomorrow and how it trades, but I'll give you these key levels that I'm looking at.
NEUT8|OK, so make sure you guys like that video.

NEUT10|So as you guys know, this is the resistance that I was looking at.
BULL11|The price was coming up.
NEUT12|It came here, resist it, broke down and ran through it.
BEAR13|Right open tire came down, tested as a support.
BULL14|So resistance turned support and started training higher right?
NEUT15|And then it just turned it all the way up.
NEUT16|So right now and this was just another support level.
BEAR17|If it would have came up he resisted and came down.
NEUT18|There's just a level that I was going to buy at.
NEUT19|This resistance was at $4.10 and this support was at $3.74.
NEUT20|So right now this level.
BEAR21|At $4.74, I wanted to go below this level and if it does go a little level I will be buying heavily.
NEUT22|I wanted to buy below this level I think would be a good price to buy it at and between these levels, but we have to see how it opens up tomorrow and if it starts coming down and even if it hits this level, I'll probably put on about 2030%, but I won't put the whole position on just in case of it starts going further, which it might.
NEUT23|But we never know for sure, so if it does start dropping further, then I'll probably put on about.
NEUT24|Rest of the position on an.
NEUT25|I'll hold that to see higher highs, but if it does, if I do put the whole position on right here and it starts to break this level, I will wait.
BEAR26|But if it breaks this level then I'll probably get out of position and wait for a new entry.
NEUT27|OK, but my main target price is around $4.74.
NEUT28|This is the main price that I want to buy it, but we have to wait to see how it opens up tomorrow and if it does open up their start turning higher then we have to wait to see.
NEUT29|If it wants to start making new highs, I think if it goes back to around $6.50 somewhere in this area, I think if it comes to this error that it might just take off to $7.00 and higher, but hopefully it starts coming down so we can get in and then ride the highs up.
NEUT30|OK, so that's it for the video now.
NEUT31|This recommendation to buyer.
NEUT32|So anything just for educational purposes only.
NEUT33|So do not try anything you see or hear.
BULL34|"News videos catch you guys in an excellent bye."""
