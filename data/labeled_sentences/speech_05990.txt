BEAR0|"""Well hello guys is a massive day today because Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have all just released their earnings reports and we're seeing some big movements in the stock market after hours."
NEUT1|Check this out.
BEAR2|Just look at Apple stock is down over 5%.
BULL3|Google Stock is up over 7%.
BEAR4|Amazon stock is down a couple of percent and Facebook stock has actually held pretty steady, and they'll likely be a sizable effect on the main U.S. stock indices because just these four companies alone make up a whopping 18% of the value of the S&P 500 stock index.
NEUT5|So let's do a super quick summary of what we saw in the earnings reports.
NEUT6|For these four companies and what we can expect with their stock prices going forward.

BULL10|So let's start with Apple and they beat Wall Street estimates for the earnings, just with the actual earnings per share coming in at $0.73 versus the $0.70 estimated and revenue coming in at 64.7 billion, versus a 63.7 billion.
BEAR11|Estimated by Wall Street look, I'm not surprised Apple stock price dropped after these earnings release because Wall Street did set the bar pretty low for them and they only just beat those estimates and no matter what, it was always going to be a disappointing quarter in terms of earnings for Apple.
NEUT12|I think instead investors will be looking forward to the next quarter earnings because they will include all the financial details from the iPhone 12 sales, so that's definitely something for us all to keep an eye on next.
BEAR13|We have Amazon who crushed Wall Street estimates, just as we expected with the actual earnings per share coming in.
BEAR14|$12.37 Versus the $7.41 estimated and revenue coming in at 96.15 billion versus the $92.7 billion estimated.
BEAR15|Despite these impressive numbers, Amazon stock still fell after market hours, but I wouldn't be too worried 'cause the markets are pretty volatile right now.
BULL16|I still think there's a lot of upside in Amazon stock long term.
BULL17|Then we have Google who also had an impressive earnings record this quarter with the actual earnings per share coming in at $16.40.
BULL18|Bus is the $11.29 estimated by Wall Street and revenue coming in at $46.17 billion versus the 42.9 billion estimated by Wall Street.
BULL19|I really think Google stock Price went up so much after hours because the UN is report really showed that their ad sales delivered big and had recovered strong since they got hit hard last quarter by the pandemic and finally on our list.
BEAR20|We have Facebook who had actual earnings per share coming out at $2.71 versus the $1.91 estimated by Wall Street.
BEAR21|On revenue coming in at $21.47 billion versus a $19.8 billion estimated and Facebook stock price remained pretty steady in the after market hours.
BULL22|The main thing for them was to show impressive revenue numbers as they did as it meant they weren't losing market share to Snapchat.
NEUT23|Like many investors were fearing.
BULL24|So there we have a crazy end to a crazy earning season which I've really enjoyed going through with you guys.
