NEUT0|"""Almost feel like these crazy moves, Morgan or or obligatory at this point."
NEUT1|Oh, it's an IPO.
NEUT2|Double it, why not?
NEUT3|Let's talk about Petco.
NEUT4|This is the one I want to focus on because I think not all IPO's are created equal.
NEUT5|This isn't even the first time it's come public.
NEUT6|It's been public three times after getting taken over by a private equity firm each time we like to call this catch and release so to speak.
NEUT7|So now you've got a company that's raised $817 million.
NEUT8|Total valuation of four billion.
NEUT9|They have a ton of debt because again, it's a private equity retread.
BEAR10|And they lost money for the 1st 3/4 of 2020, which in and of itself is not terrible.
BEAR11|But it's kind of hard to lose money on 3.6 billion in sales.
NEUT12|Not exactly sure how they managed to do it.
NEUT13|The point I would make is are you buying it just because it's an IPO or do you really want to be invested in Petco?
NEUT14|So there are other pet investments out there, pet related investments out there?
NEUT15|Want to you?
NEUT16|Couple of this is a lettuce was spun out of Pfizer Gigantic company deals with animal health both both farm animals and companion animals.
BULL17|And does very well and they sell anti infective vaccines.
NEUT18|Other health products.
NEUT19|So this is 1 worth looking at.
BULL20|Has already been a big winner, could continue.
NEUT21|Here's chewy.
BULL22|This is probably a better comp.
NEUT23|Chewy is predominantly involved in selling you things for your pet.
NEUT24|Red hot business.
NEUT25|Almost the $50 billion market cap.
BULL26|I like this one's positioning on digital a lot more than I like.
NEUT27|Anything that petco's doing and then finally idec's Labs.
NEUT28|This is another pet and animal health play.
NEUT29|It's a growth company, distributes diagnostic products, equipment, services, deals with both livestock and pets.
NEUT30|Again gets 38% of its revenue from outside of the US market.
NEUT31|So I would just look at some of these other pet plays and all this fresh PET, etc.
NEUT32|Yes, it's a hot theme, but is the dollar amount that you have allocated to that hot theme best served in affectively a 30 year old retailer?
NEUT33|That's not even the dominant player online in its category.
NEUT34|Not even the number 2.
NEUT35|So that's why I would shy away.
NEUT36|And by the way, an IPO of 65% just doesn't do it for me anymore.
NEUT37|Morgan, I don't get out of bed for anything less than 100% all day, so you're saying Wolf to Wolf?
NEUT38|I don't know.
NEUT39|I personally feel like I'm keeping my local Petco and business with all the fish were going through.
NEUT40|You gotta be chemist to keep an aquarium going.
NEUT41|I mean, yeah.
BEAR42|I also hate it.
NEUT43|I also do you right.
NEUT44|I hate the ticker Gordon, Gekko said to dog with fleas, but I don't even know why you would go with Wolf but alright.
NEUT45|But I do wish but here to your point though.
NEUT46|I mean we're seeing other names.
BULL47|A firm which went public yesterday doubled in his first day of trading.
BULL48|It's up another 18%.
NEUT49|Right now.
NEUT50|You're seeing other names like Dash and Air and B Air BNB move higher too.
NEUT51|I mean, I just to your point, it's like 60% is very what even is.
BULL52|That is yeah alright.
NEUT53|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT54|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
