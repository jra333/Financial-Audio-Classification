NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to this technical, who's with you here?"
NEUT1|It's become a million deltas in this panelist, but we're going to look at Europe or the US dollar and delete time frame.
NEUT2|Having a look at the chair now, the price has been training with, you know, symmetrical triangle formation since March 20th with a break outside likely to determine the next trend direction.
BULL3|Also, the president bounded after it found support near the uptrend line and 1.07 thirty support and or should be arguing that the picture may not be entirely negative at the moment.
NEUT4|Look at the technical indicators as to how sick is heading North after the bullish cross within the percentage K and percentage D lines.
NEUT5|However, there is seldom act.
BEAR6|Indicators are continuing to lack direction as they are flattering the near during the trial levels.
NEUT7|If the butcher take control, price advances may still initially near the one point.
NEUT8|Oh 887, which stands near the ascending line of the triangle.
BEAR9|A potential upside Val violation of this line of code.
NEUT10|Take the pair tools that every eight point 2% Fibonacci of the downlink from our point 1495 to 1.06 thirty six at 1.09 sixty two.
BEAR11|Even lower their point oh, 995 and 121 point 1040 levels would raise the likelihood of more advances before material.
NEUT12|50% of people off or print 1065.
NEUT13|On the flip side, now in case of a drop beneath the Smas and the Triangle Formation who visit your .07 thirty, which acts are strong support for the Bears?
BEAR14|Even lower the the price will test the three year low of 1.6 or 636 and the one put all five 6010 taken from the low on February of 2017.
BULL15|Overall growing dollar easy to sideline Mount and in a trendless market, so any strong move either to the upside or to the downside could give a signal for the next trend in the floral chart.
NEUT16|So that's all from me.
NEUT17|Thank you for watching.
BULL18|"Have a great day."""
