NEUT0|"""Good morning and today we're taking a look at Amazon in these videos I like to go over all you know, the overall price action of the stock."
NEUT1|And any support trends or support resistance lines that I see an if there's any significance in relation to it?
NEUT2|For Amazon's perspective and honestly to help me smash that like Button hit subscribe because it's free, but about Amazon.
NEUT3|I think you know there potentially could be some upside.
NEUT4|There's a lot of other charts that I'm looking at that we're running into some resistance.
BEAR5|And some that you know, we broke resistance or above, so it's a little bit indifferent.
NEUT6|But with Amazon I could see us at least running up to.
NEUT7|Where we got about 100 points above us.
NEUT8|After that I mean then you're basically flirting with all time highs and then you know which Google just hit all time highs not too long ago.
NEUT9|But yeah, I mean.
NEUT10|I know the overall there some of the markets been looking like it was going to get down today, but I mean if you went ahead and did get in at some point around here, then as a short term price target you know 3444 is would be my sort of if we have some form of run up would be my short term price target on where I could see.
NEUT11|You know if we got up here and we traded you know Friday Monday and didn't break above it.
BEAR12|Then and then and then, if the overall market starts having a correction, I could see us correcting back down again.
NEUT13|You know we could potentially cracked back down hit this, which used to be.
NEUT14|You know?
NEUT15|It was resistance, right?
NEUT16|And then it became support so it could be found potentially be support again.
NEUT17|Will take a look.
NEUT18|If not it could potentially come back down to here but.
NEUT19|But yeah, I mean that's basically it.
NEUT20|Something short, sweet.
NEUT21|Like I said in a different video, these videos are designed just to be.
NEUT22|If you come, you know like some days, like today there's work up.
NEUT23|We potentially make run into that resistance line, so if you're in it, you may want to sell their yeah like here.
BULL24|When I said, you know this video, hey, I could think us heading down to this line and finding support here.
NEUT25|And if we did then.
NEUT26|You know that's pretty close to here, where I would consider buying at least starting a position right?
NEUT27|And I'm like if not then we could potentially get down to here.
NEUT28|But yeah, but that's the purpose of these videos.
NEUT29|It's and then if there's any significant news that comes out, then I sort of convey that my email.
NEUT30|"Hopefully this weekend."""
