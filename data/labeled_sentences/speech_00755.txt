BULL0|"""Yeah, I mean Tesla is such a huge part of your funds at this point and that stock has had a pretty phenomenal year."
NEUT1|And those two stocks in those two funds.
NEUT2|It's a very important part.
NEUT3|It represents, as you said, 35 or 40% of each of those funds, and and that stock is up 10 times in the past two years or three years, we invested in it between 2014 and 2016, we invested 300,000,000 dollars, $320 million for a million, six shares at that time is now 8,000,000 shares at 541 splits, his $40 a share as you said, and the stocks now 400 or 420.
NEUT4|And we invested and I was on your program.
NEUT5|I was talking about how I believe we would make 20 times our money over 10 or 15 years and so far in the first four or five years that we've owned it, the stock went up and down like a yo yo, and that would be expected because what they were doing is they were building facilities, hiring people, coming up with design, it would.
NEUT6|It's a reasonable thing to bet against them all.
NEUT7|These car companies 50 avama failed and this guy somehow had made it through.
NEUT8|Sheer willpower and raise capital now is 50,000 employees and he has factories building on 3.1 to get the Tesla too.
NEUT9|I want to answer your news question but test is now building on three different continents.
NEUT10|Building in the United States building in China, Building in Germany, and you should expect more factories to be built continuously over the next 10 years.
BULL11|And this year they did OK. Well, it's certainly gotten bigger and the return that you mentioned the volatility.
BULL12|Do you think their stock is past the days of volatility because it's gotten on steadier ground?
NEUT13|Or do you worry that that some of the Robin Hood investors and others have been so attracted to what Tesla has to offer?
NEUT14|If there's any sort of shake out in the market, does that impact them?
NEUT15|And would volatility come back?
NEUT16|Well, what we worry about or not stock prices when we're investing in a business, we worry about the business and the short term.
NEUT17|I can't have any clue about what's going to happen.
NEUT18|I do think that over it's now $400 billion market cap was 43 when we started.
NEUT19|I've said for a long time I thought it was going to be one to two trillion with what developments have taken place recently.
NEUT20|I think 2 train is the right number, so I think it's five times from here, maybe 10 times in the past two or three years, but for four years before that, the business this stock didn't change.
BULL21|And the business grew tenfold.
NEUT22|So the business went from 2 billion, eight to 30 billion, 1010 times the stock price didn't change.
NEUT23|Now the stock precious caught up to where they were now.
BULL24|I think that their business is going to go from 30 or 35 billion in sales grow 50% a year.
NEUT25|I think they're going to be doing five or six or seven or $800 million in sales in 10 years.
NEUT26|I'm just the course and the batteries is another unbelievable business which I'm very excited about.
NEUT27|And I think that with that kind of valuation, that kind of.
BULL28|Results you're going to see a five times appreciation.
NEUT29|I was thinking three to five times who made 10 times so far, three to five times to come in the next 10 years.
NEUT30|2 two more doubles, maybe three more doubles in 10 years.
NEUT31|So what the expectation is?
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
