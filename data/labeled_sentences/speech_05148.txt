NEUT0|"""Alright, market timing Academy here."
NEUT1|Today is February 15th and I'm here to provide you your weekly stock analysis.
NEUT2|We're going to do a little follow up video here on Netflix.
NEUT3|If you follow our work you've been in and out of this stock here over the past couple years and have done really well is you can see one of the highlights that we made was as the stock was breaking out of this nice little basing pattern.
NEUT4|Kind of a double bottom base.
BULL5|Which resulted in a in a good strong uptrend through this area.
NEUT6|And then what we've highlighted here recently is this area right here where the stock was coming through a nice Cup shaped base and I want to show you what happened here because what we've got to do is now figure out what to do with this stock.
NEUT7|If you own it and if you don't own it, what should you do if you missed the move now?
BULL8|We highlighted your potential by point is this stock would come through this prior high within the actual base itself.
BEAR9|And we also highlighted that there was some potential buy points right through here off of your 50 day moving average.
NEUT10|Now when the stock was bouncing off of the 50 day moving average, the stock market was in an uptrend under pressure phase, which means that you want to be really careful about entering new positions.
BULL11|But regardless, if you did buy it here off the 50 day moving average, you had a really nice move to the upside.
NEUT12|But also if you waited until the true proper buy point and purchased it as it jumped through this area.
NEUT13|Resistance.
BULL14|You've had a very nice move in the stock as a matter of fact, the stock hit roughly $250 a share the other day, so over the course of just two weeks, you're up literally 25% on this stock.
NEUT15|So the bottom line is, is, what do you do?
NEUT16|Well, most of the time, what we suggest is that.
NEUT17|When a stock moves 25% after your buy point, you automatically sell it.
NEUT18|OK, don't get greedy, but the one exception to that rule.
NEUT19|The one exception is when a stock moves 20 to 25% or more in less than six weeks.
NEUT20|If a stock moves that fast, and that quick, usually there's significant upside that's about to come on the stock, and so you can see right through here as this stock was breaking out, we had major volume.
NEUT21|We've got a good move here in the Mac D, and a good move in the slow stochastics, and so the bottom line is is this is that.
NEUT22|You're going to want to keep your stops close on this stock.
NEUT23|I bring your stops either right, up to break even, which is the entry point, or I would even bring it up to the bottom of this channel, which would be roughly $220 a share.
NEUT24|Either way, stay in the stock.
NEUT25|This one's looking like it wants to make a significant run because it moves so quickly.
NEUT26|Otherwise keep your stocks or keep your stops close so you protect the gains that you've got.
NEUT27|If you want to be a little bit more long term, just put yourself at a break, even stop so that you you've got a risk free trade heavy here.
NEUT28|So this is the market timing Academy.
