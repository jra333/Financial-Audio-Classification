NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead."
NEUT1|Stocks have done well since the recent lows and the question for investors is should you buy now?
NEUT2|Should you get out she just stay put overtime.
NEUT3|Stocks always do well.
BEAR4|The problem is there plenty of ups and downs along the way.
NEUT5|Take the 1970s in the late 1960s from 1968 to 1982.
NEUT6|The Dow Jones went nowhere long period of time, so long term average is great.
NEUT7|But in between a lot of turmoil.
NEUT8|So what should you do now?
NEUT9|Here's what to watch out for what the economy will be doing will depend, of course, on the economic environment.
NEUT10|This is why the elections will be so important.
NEUT11|Well, we have a new regime in 2021 of more low taxes, more deregulation, a stable dollar, or.
NEUT12|Well, we go the way of Europe.
NEUT13|Higher taxes, heavier burdens on business and more and more taxes whichever way we go will determine the course of the stock market.
NEUT14|Well, we have a new boom or we have another one of those dreadful periods like the 1970s.
NEUT15|Here's another thing to watch out for what happens with all that money.
NEUT16|Printing all that money being created to provide life lines for businesses and individuals.
NEUT17|If Washington handles the challenge well, we won't get a new inflation in an economic crisis.
BEAR18|But if it mishandles it by golly we will have trouble.
NEUT19|Here's what you should look for there.
NEUT20|The price of gold, the price of gold keeps moving up and reaches new highs.
BEAR21|Bad news for your stocks.
BULL22|However, if gold stay stable.
BULL23|Or gently goes down that will be good news for your stocks.
BULL24|Of course, if we get suddenly a miracle treatment or vaccine for COVID-19, then the economy will quickly come back.
NEUT25|And of course stocks will too.
NEUT26|But in the meantime, expect trouble but long term if you are in a retirement plan, whether it's a 401K or an IR, A or something else.
NEUT27|Keep putting in that retirement money.
NEUT28|Whether you do it annually, each paycheck, quarterly, whatever the schedule.
NEUT29|Keep putting that money in and ignore it.
BULL30|Overtime you will always beat professional money managers and you will have a better retirement.
NEUT31|There is a case of do it and look away.
NEUT32|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT33|Thank you for listening.
BULL34|"Look forward to talking to you soon again."""
