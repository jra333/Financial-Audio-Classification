BULL0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the crude oil market and you can see that WTI has rallied quite nicely during the trading session here on Friday as it looks like we are in fact going to go looking towards that gap that I've been talking about for ages now where the 200 day Ma meets up right."
NEUT1|About $41.00.
BEAR2|So I think that gap gets filled and then we get a bit of a pullback.
BEAR3|OPEC probably going to cut.
NEUT4|Supply, but that's by now been priced in same thing.
NEUT5|Over here Ann Brandt.
NEUT6|I think we're going to try to fill this gap here at 45.
BULL7|Now that we've broken above the 40 level that I've been talking about, then we are starting to look at the 200 day MA as resistance as well.
BULL8|I think we got another day or two worth of gains.
BULL9|"I don't know if it takes 2 days or five days to get there, but it certainly looks as if we're going to try to fill these gaps."""
