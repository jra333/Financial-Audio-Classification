NEUT0|"""Yo was good, traders gonna do a quick video on how to set up an S&P 500 ETF option spread for beginners."
NEUT1|So let's go.
NEUT2|I'm gonna share my screen, get right into this.
NEUT3|OK, right here you can see my screen and I'm in the Tastyworks platform and I have the trade marked up.
NEUT4|So right here I'm going to go and choose the strategy.
NEUT5|I'm gonna do a vertical spread put selling spread.
NEUT6|So this is like 101 for beginners like this platform is super good.
NEUT7|It has like all of the statistics it has like the standard deviation.
NEUT8|Showing this to show you guys how I mark up a trade.
NEUT9|So I'm going to go out 45 days.
NEUT10|For optimal premium.
NEUT11|Yes, we got 47 days, so that's good enough here and then I'm gonna go.
NEUT12|Over.
NEUT13|When I get to 45 days, I'm gonna go over to around 1:10 deviation.
NEUT14|So S&P.
NEUT15|SPY is currently trading at $363.
NEUT16|So I'm going to place here.
NEUT17|This puts bread.
NEUT18|Around the 351 strike and I'm going to keep the by the put option at 346.
NEUT19|I'm gonna keep it super tight and you see like the probability to make this $107.00 are going to be 67% so I'm going to let me see about game.
NEUT20|Get a little bit OK right here so I'm risking 400 to make $100.
NEUT21|Going to see what that percentage is going to be.
NEUT22|And pull up the cargo door.
NEUT23|So 100.
NEUT24|So that's the 25% and if we manage that at 50% profit.
BULL25|We're looking at a 12.5 return in 30 days so.
NEUT26|You guys are you guys can hit review and sad and will mark it up right there and then.
NEUT27|Once the stock market opens that trade will get executed.
NEUT28|So like I like to keep it super simple.
NEUT29|I like to do a vertical put spread around a standard deviation from when the current strike price is currently trading just to keep it simple.
NEUT30|So this is a quick and easy way to make a quick $50 and less the state 10 days so we went.
NEUT31|45 days automotive trade to make initial $100 credit received and then just to keep things simple, once I make $50, I'll close it out for a profit and then place another trade.
NEUT32|"And that was abson selling 101."""
