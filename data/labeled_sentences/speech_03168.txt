BULL0|"""February and actually large parts of the American economy, real estate manufacturing, shipping actually doing quite well."
NEUT1|Joining us now is Bill Lee, chief economist at the Milken Institute and data Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board.
NEUT2|Bill and Dana.
NEUT3|Welcome to you both day and I'll start with you.
NEUT4|Your take on Jay pal.
NEUT5|Do you believe the Federal Reserve has?
NEUT6|This is not a traditional slow down.
NEUT7|This is not caused by this or that.
BEAR8|It's caused by people not wanting to go to work or unable to go to work.
NEUT9|Because they don't want to get sick.
NEUT10|Does the Federal Reserve have the power that it usually would in a slowdown of traditional kind?
NEUT11|Well, I mean, they're still tools that the Fed has, certainly using words and such as, even if it means breaking out the resources there.
NEUT12|But I think you know the the key issue here is that the Fed is said that full employment is a broad and inclusive mandate.
NEUT13|So that means the Fed is going to be looking at multiple indicators here, not just the overall unemployment rate, but unemployment rates in labor force participation for different groups, women, persons who are young people with low skills.
NEUT14|Different racial groups, and so I think that given the fact that yes we are, you know 10-9 to 10 million jobs under where we were prior to the pandemic.
NEUT15|the Fed is still very concerned about the bottom line for households.
NEUT16|And I hear you on that Bill, but here's the thing.
NEUT17|I I, you know, I've traveled extensively during the pandemic.
NEUT18|You know, mostly by car, sitting alone in rooms or whatever it might be, and I've noticed that there's multiple economies.
NEUT19|California New York, Northeast Chicago are very different than the half of America School kids are actually in school in person like 42%, I think, which you'd never notice if you just read the headlines.
NEUT20|I bring that up for a reason.
NEUT21|The Milken Conference, usually the first week in May in person.
NEUT22|Couple 1000 people come to Elei spend a bunch of money at hotels and dinners.
NEUT23|That's not happening.
NEUT24|Is the Federal Reserve able to fix that?
BEAR25|Those are the 9 million jobs.
NEUT26|That's what the Democrats would like the Fed to do, and it's sort of mission creep that's been given to the Fed because what they really need to do is fiscal policy and fiscal policy is what can address disparities in the economy.
BEAR27|Brian, as you've noticed, the service sector has been crushed by the by the pandemic, and you know that there are six people working in the service sector for every person producing goods.
BEAR28|So that means that in order for these services to come back, we're going to have to restore a lot of jobs.
BULL29|And that's what the chair Paul's word about it to sustain large scale job increases.
NEUT30|Without turning on inflation, and I think one of the things that the markets gotten wrong is that the inflation fears associated with rate increases are really misplaced because rates are still at only 10 years at 1.31 point 4 and it was at 1.9 at the beginning of 2020.
NEUT31|So when nowhere near where rates should be in a normal recovery.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
