NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol."
NEUT1|PCG we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action POV, but you look down here at the volume and nicely above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs on this one headed into next weeks.
NEUT5|Let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT6|And I say next week's friendly reminder markets are closed on Friday.
NEUT7|So first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly one.
BULL8|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could stay up there above 935.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below $9.35.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL11|But yeah, if the price could manage to stay above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT17|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT18|That right there is how I'm defining the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls run full control.
NEUT21|You must visualize that.
NEUT22|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT23|Yeah, stand above the green line.
NEUT24|There would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT25|Nothing fancy or complicated here at all, just a question of where did the party in momentum finally stop?
NEUT26|And then we got our answer right up there at $9.65.
BULL27|So 965 will be that initial area of resistance if the price can push up through 965, then the next key level after that.
NEUT28|Would be up there right around $9.80, but on all anyway, look at it.
BULL29|Great volume today.
BULL30|Very nice price movement.
NEUT31|Not just the question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT32|Let's see what happens.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird.
NEUT38|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT39|But in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT43|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT45|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
