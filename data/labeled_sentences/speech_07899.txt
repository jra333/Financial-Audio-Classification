NEUT0|"""Let's take a look at Facebook to see what is going on today."
NEUT1|So Facebook for the past week it has been trading the range at 270 to 277 in today.
NEUT2|So if you bought every day at the low and so at the high, you've been making money for a whole week on Facebook.
NEUT3|Today is a reversal, so instead of going down it went up to try break out.
NEUT4|But it is not holding, it did not hold at all.
BEAR5|It fell back down immediately, so if it doesn't close above 280 today, it will not be a breakout.
NEUT6|It will try again tomorrow.
NEUT7|So.
NEUT8|Hang on tight.
NEUT9|"Hang on to Facebook."""
