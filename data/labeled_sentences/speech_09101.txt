NEUT0|"""What's up, ladies and gentlemen, in the Blue Collar finance, I just got home right now, I just opened my phone an what do I see?"
BULL1|A notification that says BFT is up over 5.8% after hours?
NEUT2|This is insane.
NEUT3|I open up my Robin Hood account and this is what I see.
BULL4|Ladies and gentlemen, fully transmin BFT is doing something amazing right now.
BULL5|It just shot up from 1540.
BULL6|All the way up to 1654, it's up over 6% after hours out of nowhere.
NEUT7|What is going on right now?
NEUT8|This is insane.
NEUT9|So I instantly jump on my computer.
NEUT10|I need to find out what caused this spike up.
BEAR11|We've been trading sideways and sort of down on BFT yesterday and today and then all of a sudden we have that shoot up after hours on no news so I get on my computer.
NEUT12|I do a quick Google search so a guy named Grasso on CNBC said BFT is a three times.
NEUT13|Or that means you're going to get your money three times over it to triple.
BULL14|Winner baby so hence why the stock shot up at some positive news we're getting closer to that merger announcement date.
NEUT15|So we're getting closer to that merger date and the only direction we're going from here is up.
NEUT16|Ladies and gentlemen.
BULL17|So thank you so much for watching.
NEUT18|I wanted to get this news out to you guys as quick as possible.
NEUT19|If you can give the video a like subscribe.
NEUT20|I'm going to be sharing a lot more content.
BULL21|Thank you so much for watching you guys take care until next time.
BULL22|"God bless."""
