NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for June 15th, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm Celina Nicholas, technical analyst that exam.com.
NEUT2|Today we will look at the US dollar versus Japanese yen on the daily chart.
BEAR3|And looking at the bigger picture, we can see that USD JPY is bearish, as the pair has made lower lows lower highs since falling from a June 2015 peak of 125.84 and fell down to 105.54, Lynn may.
BEAR4|The market is below the 5100 and 200 day moving averages, which are all sloping down and thus supporting the bearish bias.
BEAR5|In the near term, we can see that the market is expected to pause its decline for now, as downward momentum has weakened, the RSI is no longer trending downward.
BEAR6|It stopped on a sloping down and has approached oversold levels.
NEUT7|30 below 30 is extreme so, but if prices do continue downwards from current levels to the downside, the next level to focus on is.
BEAR8|The year to date, Loaf 105.54 touched on May 3rd and then below this.
BEAR9|A key level of the round figure 105 would give support but major resistance for any upside moves lies at 108.
BEAR10|The key level which if breached would help bring a recovery, but a move above the 114 level would be required to weaken the bearish bias, 'cause above 114 would result in the market.
NEUT11|Retracing more than half of the down leg, the 50% Fibonacci.
NEUT12|She's here, so if prices rise above this level, this would retrace more than half of the down like that took place from the peak of one 2584 down to 105.54.
BULL13|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
