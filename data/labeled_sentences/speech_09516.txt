NEUT0|"""Now let's stay with that Kazakhstan story because our markets desk has been tracking the credit picture of Kazakhstan John Ehrlichman, specifically back with that story."
NEUT1|John talk to me about Kazakhstan, and I will prove that we can tie Borat and CDs together.
NEUT2|Chris, because we like to look at our credit default swap sometimes when we're looking at a country's credit picture.
BULL3|In the case of Kazakhstan, though, no sovereign debt benefited tremendously from the commodities boom as a result, this is a country I should say.
NEUT4|Where in Haga Fiber management says running some of the biggest or was running some of the biggest surpluses in the world.
NEUT5|The question now is whether or not this becomes a Saudi Arabia of the 1980s.
NEUT6|Type story.
NEUT7|What we did however see during the boom was many of the country's banks do a lot of borrowing in dollars and euros and I'm going to show you some of the CDs for one of those banks.
NEUT8|Cash Commerce Bank and it's over the past five years you go back to when Borat hit the theaters.
BEAR9|Actually things were a lot more calm, but because of all that borrowing and the drop in commodity prices.
BEAR10|You've seen this massive spike in the CDs, even though it's come off its highs of the year.
BULL11|It's still dramatically above where it was just five years ago.
NEUT12|Back to you.
BULL13|Thank you, John.
NEUT14|Learning about Kazakhstan.
NEUT15|"I like doing that on a Tuesday morning."""
