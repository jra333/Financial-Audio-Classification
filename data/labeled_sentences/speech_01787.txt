BEAR0|"""The price of gold has been nearing an 8 year high when the yellow metal goes up."
BEAR1|That's usually not good news for stocks.
BEAR2|Stocks took a hit on Wednesday, only came back a little bit on Thursday.
NEUT3|So what lies ahead?
NEUT4|I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
NEUT5|Will we give you the insights you need to navigate this ever turbulent world?
NEUT6|While the stock market's had a great run from its lows in March, now it seems to be in pause mode.
NEUT7|What is holding it back?
BEAR8|Uncertainty stock markets try to anticipate the future and right now, clouds are rising up.
NEUT9|One big one, of course, is the rise in coronavirus cases coming out of places like Texas and Florida.
BULL10|This does not mean a new lock down, but it could mean speed buffs in terms of recovery in the economy.
NEUT11|Opening it up another big cloud on the horizon that has not been fully appreciated is what's going to happen with the election.
NEUT12|What kind of an economy will we have in January when we have an environment that is conducive to lowering taxes, lowering burdens on individuals and businesses?
NEUT13|Or will it be the opposite?
BEAR14|Markets are uncertain on that.
NEUT15|Of course, another factor of the stock market will be what will be in a new stimulus bill.
BULL16|I think even though there will be a lot of spending, it will do more good than harm.
BULL17|That would be good for stocks.
BULL18|But not good enough to get the market to real new highs.
NEUT19|So in terms of the stock market itself, you should probably stay on the sideline.
NEUT20|You don't have to rush in and put in new money.
NEUT21|Let's digest these uncertainties and make sure these clouds don't turn into storms.
NEUT22|As for gold itself, you should always have some in your portfolio.
NEUT23|Just as an insurance policy.
NEUT24|So for your retirement plans, keep making those monthly or quarterly or annual payments.
BULL25|You'll do well over time.
NEUT26|Don't try to be a market timer.
NEUT27|But for the stock market itself, expect turbulence.
BULL28|We've had a fantastic comeback from what happened in March.
BULL29|However, that's anticipating a lot of good news ahead.
NEUT30|The economy will eventually fully recover, but it's all going to depend on getting barriers out of the way.
NEUT31|And when we get those barriers out of the way, good things will happen.
NEUT32|But will we get those barriers out of the way that remains the big question.
NEUT33|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL34|Thank you so much for listening.
NEUT35|Do send in your comments.
BULL36|"I look forward to speaking with you soon again."""
