NEUT0|"""I'm going to be going over these fellow cryptocurrency talking about if it's worth buying and giving my price prediction for this coin for 2021."
NEUT1|Now.
NEUT2|A couple of months ago Coinbase released this coin and at the time I did research it a little bit, but it didn't hit my radar until it went up about 60% in the last 24 hours.
NEUT3|So I figured I need to look into this point a little bit more, which I did.
NEUT4|Also as I'm going over this guys remember this is not financial advice.
NEUT5|Do your research and I would also appreciate it guys smash the like button as we're going over this.
NEUT6|OK so anyways here it is.
NEUT7|Right now it's at 2:55.
BULL8|You know a coin you can see for the last 24 hours is up like 58% for the last week it's up 65 and then for the last month it's up about 40%.
BULL9|So it's doing pretty good for the year.
NEUT10|It's up to 100% as well and you know kind of going over it.
NEUT11|Here you can kind of see that it was starting to get a base price of around like a dollar $52.70.
NEUT12|It did pump in 2020 to like 4 bucks but it went back down to kind of like that dollar fifty to dollars 70 range.
NEUT13|So now let's talk about what this coin is exactly, which is what I wanted to do now.
NEUT14|Sello is a proof of stake based blockchain with smart contracts.
NEUT15|The technologies is a phone number based identity system with addresses based encryption that allows you to.
NEUT16|Basically, you know, send money to anybody you want, so they're trying to like make it a way to send money on your phone and it's basically for people who don't have like bank accounts.
NEUT17|That's what they're going for.
NEUT18|So I've got the website pulled up here.
NEUT19|You know the project.
NEUT20|It is a little bit newer, but they've got some people who have thrown a lot of money into this coin.
NEUT21|Jack Dorsey is one of the guys that put a lot of money into it, so you know they got some good funding.
NEUT22|Going to Scroll down a little bit more here.
NEUT23|There's actually an app for this too and I wanted to just pull up the page for it.
NEUT24|It's called the Flora Mobile payments app.
NEUT25|It's pretty interesting and I was kind of going through it.
NEUT26|It's only got 37 ratings, which is kind of disappointing, but when I Scroll down here somebody explained it really well and they basically just said that the app feels like a lot like Venmo.
NEUT27|So if you ever use Venmo before to, like, send money to somebody, that's basically what they're doing here with, you know a crypto currency based background, and it's interesting, right?
NEUT28|I mean, but we're going to be taking a look at the price just if it's a goodbye or not right now currently on Coinmarketcap.
NEUT29|This coin is ranked, let's say 66, and you know, to be honest with you guys, I try not to buy coins that are not even in there.
NEUT30|Like the top 20 right now top 30.
NEUT31|I'll look at those.
NEUT32|But you know, this one's a little bit.
BEAR33|You know off my radar.
NEUT34|I guess you can say, but it caught my eye.
NEUT35|Currently it's got a market cap of 318,000,000 and like 124,000,000 coins in circulation now.
NEUT36|I pulled up digitalcoinprice.com.
NEUT37|This is a pretty decent site where you can check out some like forecast for crypto's.
NEUT38|They were giving it a $4.50 price for 2021 which is reasonable but.
NEUT39|I have my own thinking on this and just remember this isn't like financial advice.
NEUT40|You know if you could get Sello between like $1.80 and $2.00 and you were willing to hold on to it for like you know a few months to maybe like a year, I could easily see getting up to four to six bucks within 12 months.
NEUT41|Obviously I can't predict the future, but that would be my price prediction for it anyways.
NEUT42|The coins interesting.
NEUT43|Definitely recommend researching a little bit.
NEUT44|Check out their website what they're trying to do.
NEUT45|Hope I explained it to you guys pretty well 'cause I know that there are some people have tried explaining with fellow is.
BEAR46|Haven't really done a good job at it anyways.
