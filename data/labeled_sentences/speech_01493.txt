BEAR0|"""Berkshire Hathaway may be undervalued."
NEUT1|I purchased over $2000.00 with the stock in Berkshire Hathaway recently and it's a very diversified investment.
NEUT2|Berkshire Hathaway owns insurance companies.
NEUT3|It owns a railroad company and owns Apple that has Amazon in its investment portfolio.
NEUT4|They own banks.
NEUT5|They own Helzberg diamond.
NEUT6|They own many companies like 40 or 60 companies.
NEUT7|Either they own the whole company or they own large stakes in or the primary shareholder.
NEUT8|In that company.
NEUT9|You should invest in Berkshire Hathaway over the past 3040 years.
BULL10|Have been one of the best performing stocks.
NEUT11|There's thousands of stocks traded on the stock market and there's only like 8 or 10 of them that have really performed strongly and has beat the S&P 500 for the past 3040 years in Berkshire Hathaway is one of them.
BULL12|Recently, in the past few years, Berkshire Hathaway really hasn't outperformed the S&P 500, but it still has outperformed most mutual funds and ETF's traded on the stock market.
NEUT13|And recently the Magellan Fund.
NEUT14|Is it going to be traded as an ETF?
NEUT15|It's a mutual fund that used to be managed by Peter Lynch, and that fund is very famous for out performing at one point, but Berkshire Hathaway's beat the Magellan Fund at Berkshire Hathaway's way.
BULL16|Better to invest and even today then the Magellan Fund Berkshire Hathaway's return are superior to the Magellan Fund and perhaps Berkshire Hathaway will outperform the market these few years to come.
NEUT17|Because Berkshire Hathaway owns some of the best.
NEUT18|Stocks out there may own Apple an Amazon if you invest in Berkshire Hathaway, or automatically dipping your toe in like 40 or 60 different companies amongst many of many sectors.
NEUT19|And I think everyone should have Berkshire Hathaway in their investment work volume.
NEUT20|And most people that have a 401K are already have money in Berkshire Hathaway because Berkshire Hathaway is one of the companies in the S&P 500 mutual funds that are offered through many 401K.
NEUT21|Providers, it's usually one of the fourth or one of the top ten Holdings, and usually it's usually like the fourth or six holding and the mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500.
BULL22|"Because Berkshire Hathaway is is one of the most profitable an one of the most biggest biggest companies in the world."""
