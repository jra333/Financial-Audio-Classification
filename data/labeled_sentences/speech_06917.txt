NEUT0|"""People are asking basically where do you see graph GRT?"
NEUT1|By the end of 2021?
BEAR2|OK, well the bad news is because of the technical problems.
NEUT3|I can't share my screen.
NEUT4|There was, I know, I'm I'm looking at the chart right now.
NEUT5|So.
NEUT6|Graph came out and it's near $0.50 right?
NEUT7|It's near.
NEUT8|The higher end of its recent range, so let's just think about what happened with graphene.
NEUT9|Went all the way up.
NEUT10|It would trace about 2/3 of the way right?
NEUT11|Remember that famous 62% retracement?
NEUT12|And now it bounces and sister.
NEUT13|Now that looks an awful lot like what Sinthetix looks like, right?
NEUT14|Noise.
BEAR15|Dropped it throughout crypto.
NEUT16|Crypto's renaissance we've developed a few of our own formations, right?
NEUT17|We had formations for djent coins and now graph is doing exactly what synthetics was doing.
NEUT18|Two or three months ago.
NEUT19|Which is, you know, it pops up.
NEUT20|It goes down and then it's it's so I don't see any reason why graph can't go to like two or three dollars.
NEUT21|Right, it could be the next moon shot.
NEUT22|No, it's on Coinbase and frequently aultz.
NEUT23|That get to coin base.
NEUT24|It's like a graveyard, but tell that to synthetics.
NEUT25|Right?
NEUT26|All of these coins that connected to either the ecosystem or eventually to the.net Dot ecosystem.
NEUT27|Are going to have striking price rallies and they're going to move in groups, so it may not go all at once.
NEUT28|But like as soon as Eve hits 2K, all of these smaller coins.
NEUT29|They're all going to smoke, and that probably includes djent, and it definitely includes graph.
