BULL0|"""Oil prices have risen over the last week to again reach around $50 a barrel after recent comments from OPEC and its de facto leader, Saudi Arabia have raised hopes for an output freeze as early as next month."
NEUT1|Last week, OPEC announced that it would hold an informal meeting of ministers in September on the sidelines of an industry conference in Algiers.
BEAR2|A few days later, remarks by Saudi Energy Minister Hollydale follow were accidentally released to the media indicating the Kingdom could participate in coordinated action to help balance the oil market.
BEAR3|While some market participants have focused on this chatter about renewed attempts, perhaps for a production freeze after a failed attempt in April, others are fixated on Saudi production.
BULL4|Although Saudi Arabia has said it is keen to cooperate with other producer countries and engage in dialogue, its own production has reached record levels.
BULL5|As it makes an aggressive push for export market share.
BULL6|Mr. Farley said the recent increase can be attributed not just a heightened oil use for power generation during Saudi's hot summer months, but also to increase demand from foreign buyers.
BULL7|Data last week showed output hit 10.7 million barrels a day in July, and analysts are saying this could increase further in the coming months.
BULL8|Saudi Arabia is stepping up its foreign sales amid growing competition from rivals such as Iran, Iraq and Russia.
BEAR9|Mr. Farley in June said the Kingdom did not want to flood the market with Saudi oil, which would put a dampener on prices, and he sought to put his OPEC peers at ease.
BULL10|"But the recent data and comments from the Saudi minister will only raise anxieties among those countries, keen to see a higher oil price."""
