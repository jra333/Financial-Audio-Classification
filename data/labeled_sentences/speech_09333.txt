NEUT0|"""Well, if you look at verse the week ago were about the same place."
BULL1|Actually as of a couple of days ago while the escapade was making a new high.
NEUT2|None of the sectors work, so market is just kind of digesting the gains from November with the addition of the Russell 2000 which is playing a significant game of catch up on this.
NEUT3|This theory of excess liquid, a theory, the reality of excess liquidity coupled with a synchronized global recovery.
BULL4|Now it's being accepted in driving those laggard at signal and more economically sensitive areas.
NEUT5|Iron.
NEUT6|Nancy, what are you doing in the in the final weeks of the year?
BEAR7|As we've seen this tremendous run up and now a few days of a pullback was only 1 1/2% over the last four days.
NEUT8|Where does that leave you?
NEUT9|Well, we were.
NEUT10|We run pretty fully invested all the time.
NEUT11|Sarah.
BEAR12|So we have been trimming our winners.
BULL13|It's nothing super original an adding to names that we've wanted to own for awhile, but generally speaking we're pretty optimistic mid term short term, I think we'll see a pullback sometime in the first of the year.
NEUT14|Maybe before that and then will be much more aggressive about going in.
BULL15|And adding to the higher quality names just like we did in March in April of this year.
NEUT16|Let's talk Apple.
BULL17|It is leading the Dow today.
NEUT18|That stock rallying?
BULL19|There's the NASDAQ up 1%, but Apple has been the biggest winner in the Dow on the back of some reports that the company is set to ramp up iPhone production by 30% in the first half of the year.
BULL20|The report says that Apple is also planning to increase production of its high end computers like the MacBook Pro.
BULL21|The stock is up almost 5%.
NEUT22|Nancy comes off of a Nikkei report.
NEUT23|Not sure how many of these reports actually turn out to be true, but it does tell you something that.
BEAR24|The stock is having such a sharp reaction.
NEUT25|What's your optimism?
BULL26|Optimism level on Apple in this cycle that it's going through.
NEUT27|Well, as you know, we're long term shareholders.
NEUT28|We were buying the stock at a 9 multiple Anna yield above the 10 year when that actually meant something and we've been net sellers in the last year.
BEAR29|We reduced our position by about 30% overall and that was just due to stock appreciation and then actually reducing our Holdings.
NEUT30|At this level.
BULL31|I think you know, stocks been meandering for about 3 months, and I think the news is even more than the iPhone production.
NEUT32|They're just doing a lot of things right, and you know the new fitness app that you mentioned.
BULL33|The Mac Pro iPads were left for dead two years ago and have really had robust returns, so you know we're at with new money.
BULL34|We're putting it money to work there, but we haven't increased our allocation to the Holdings.
NEUT35|I'd like to see the fundamentals catch up with the stock price, which is now trading at 32 times next year.
NEUT36|Tony Apple an the other big cap tech winners of the year.
NEUT37|Do you think there more do a pullback than the broader indices?
NEUT38|I think they already have.
NEUT39|Well, if I if you took it out, look at his six month chart of Apple.
BEAR40|It's well below where it was, I think 7% below where it was at the August peak and I think that's a really important point.
NEUT41|So even Apple is playing a little bit of catch up here and I I'm with Nancy.
NEUT42|Between the excessive optimism I mean it is really incredible.
NEUT43|Some of the optimism.
NEUT44|It's out there and this rush to catch those.
BEAR45|The stocks that haven't participated as well or do for an early year causing the upside.
NEUT46|But I, I believe rather than.
NEUT47|Sure it because of that access liquidity and that global recovery.
NEUT48|I could be up to attack it.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
