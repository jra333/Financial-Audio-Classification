NEUT1|Also if you like 3 free stocks, Wonder Woman rabbeted.
NEUT2|Check the links in the description below.
BEAR3|So guys we're having a crazy day for zoom right now.
BULL4|We know zoom gapped up open.
NEUT5|Let's go into the five minute chart over here.
BEAR6|We got a broken today in the morning and we're seeing zoom immensely pulled back right now.
NEUT7|This was the gap in the morning of about 10% right?
NEUT8|Was it alright?
BULL9|7 1/2%.
NEUT10|So right now we're seeing zoom dump at 2:15 and this is due to the news that just came out of Facebook where they're releasing Facebook Messenger room video chats, and this is a huge news article because it's getting into the realm of what zoom does.
NEUT11|It's getting into the realm of what bluejeans does for Verizon against into the realm of what Microsoft Teams and Webex does for Cisco and Microsoft, so guys is extremely bearish news because we're seeing so many providers right now flooding the same market and right now zoom stock in the morning.
BULL12|Surged hugely right due to this inclusion into the NASDAQ 100, which is the NASDAQ 100 top companies.
BEAR13|But right now guys we're seeing a huge pull back due to the fact that so many people are flooding this market and the demand for this is surely really high right now.
NEUT14|But what's going to happen when we go back to normal and kind of we don't see a huge shift of people staying at home anymore.
NEUT15|We see them more going back to work and doing different things right?
NEUT16|Getting out of the house while you're in the house.
BULL17|Sure, this can be profitable for these companies, but we see many companies are going through this market right now.
NEUT18|Because I want to make a note of what time this came out so you guys will find this funny.
NEUT19|This came out at 2:15 right at 2:15.
BEAR20|This Facebook article just dropped right?
NEUT21|And guys, what did the price of zoom do at that exact moment?
BEAR22|It dropped 5% within 5 minutes of the news article coming out and we're further down right now.
BEAR23|We've dropped, let's see.
BEAR24|From the time the news article came out, we've dropped about 11% of the Max 11.8%.
NEUT25|So right now guys zoom is not looking good with this Facebook news, we also see that Facebook is kind of pushing further into this market because they can take advantage of the fact that so many people are using their social media platforms and zoom doesn't really have that amount of the huge amount of an audience to kind of keep them there for a long time, right?
NEUT26|They only are really used for kind of business sometimes and kind of educational purposes, right?
NEUT27|But let's get into Facebook and see what happened.
NEUT28|That exact time that this article was also released, right?
NEUT29|And this was the time that the articles released we headed much higher.
NEUT30|Right now we're trading from the time of release of that article.
NEUT31|At 2:15, we're trading 2% to 9% higher for Facebook stock.
NEUT32|So guys, this is just funny to me that in the morning we had an extremely positive news for zoom, and then we kind of all get hit with this kind of news that Facebook's were launching their app much sooner than they would have, but they're doing it due to the high demand.
NEUT33|Obviously for telecommunications and teleconferencing apps, so that is just watch out when trading zoom right now.
NEUT34|I really don't think zoom is about you, guys know this from my.
NEUT35|Previous article on previous video on Blue Jeans and Verizon's acquisition of them, and you know that I don't think that this market is kind of sustainable.
NEUT36|I mean, if you guys think about it, what is zoom really do right?
NEUT37|I mean, zoom is kind of similar to Skype, right?
BULL38|Just maybe with more people.
NEUT39|So guys just want investing in stocks and kind of know the actual fundamental business model of these companies before putting money into them.
NEUT40|So stay safe out there guys, please like and subscribe if you found this content valuable and thank you guys for watching.
BULL41|"Have a great one."""
