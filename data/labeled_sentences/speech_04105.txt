NEUT0|"""OK so Dan we gotta go right to it."
NEUT1|I usually don't ask CEOs to apply it on the stock.
BEAR2|I want them to apply on their company, but I do have to wonder that maybe there's an overly negative reaction you did have.
NEUT3|You know, a different difficult transition and write down a 4G product, but the future is 5G.
NEUT4|You've got the best 5G you got the best company in T-Mobile, so I'm trying to figure out whether the past is prologue or not.
NEUT5|Well, obviously I'm not a market pundit, but I will tell you this, we're focused on the long term trend, the secular trend, and for us it's all about 5G.
NEUT6|We continue to see strong demand for a 4G product, so you can think of it like layers on the cake for in five Chief are both consumer as well as enterprise.
NEUT7|For launching a number of new Enterprise Products.
BULL8|This in the first half under Wavemaker Pro brand and then our cloud subscription business grew triple digits.
BEAR9|Last year, so I think there's some things going on in the company that we're not getting credit for.
NEUT10|Clearly a check has been a tough market recently, but we remain focused on the secular trends, and we're centering the company on those.
NEUT11|But you did say that certain your term, it was hard to predict was a term used, and then you said that some of your customers are in a wait and see mode.
BEAR12|And when I read that I said oh wait, and see may mean that there's going to be a gap in your sales and earnings.
NEUT13|Well, we've got.
NEUT14|You know there's a few dynamics going on at one time.
NEUT15|You know there's the post pandemic trendline.
NEUT16|Nobody can fully predict.
BEAR17|But I will say this, the surgeon demand we saw in our 4G products last year has abated.
NEUT18|As you might expect.
BULL19|But as we predicted, we're seeing demand for 4G products higher than pre pandemic.
BULL20|We crowd quadruple their 5G revenue last year.
NEUT21|That trend continues up to the right.
BULL22|We tripled our cloud subscription business last year, so I think there's a lot of dynamics in play.
NEUT23|There's as we refer to as crossing vectors, but long term trends are up into the right.
NEUT24|So our investment strategy has not changed 1 bit.
