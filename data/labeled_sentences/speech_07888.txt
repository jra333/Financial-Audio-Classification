NEUT0|"""Alright, let's answer some of your questions now."
NEUT1|Farmer Jim coming to you, Gabriel in Florida.
NEUT2|Follow Jim Leighton.
NEUT3|The other person is following you.
NEUT4|Jim.
NEUT5|I followed the farmer into Marathon Petroleum in my Roth IR a about a year ago.
NEUT6|I bought it about $18.00.
BEAR7|Should I hold seller reduce my position?
NEUT8|You should hold your position 18 now it's 54.
BEAR9|It's down from 60.
NEUT10|It'll be back above 60 probably.
NEUT11|I think this quarter when they close the sale of the Speedway gas chain.
NEUT12|Get a ton of gas in.
NEUT13|Excuse me ton of cash into refinance their balance sheet.
BULL14|Also, refinery utilization is picking up prices for gas or picking up.
BULL15|Things are looking pretty good for the refiners right now and this is the best of the bunch.
NEUT16|Don't be flustered Jimmy, you should be flattered.
NEUT17|I mean, this is these are flattering moments, right?
BEAR18|Gas cash, Qualcomm Marathon cut.
NEUT19|Yeah, why see you from Brian in Saint Charles for Steve Weiss, Jumia?
NEUT20|You've talked about it positive positively about this name many times in the past.
BEAR21|Sure has stocks been under pressure lately?
NEUT22|Do you still like the name?
NEUT23|Love the name I added to it.
NEUT24|They had two things going against him.
NEUT25|They had a terrible tape for high growth tech stocks and then they had an offering.
NEUT26|The offering was done as of Monday and it was done at 38 and change.
BULL27|I think the stock regains its old highs and it's moving a positive.
NEUT28|Since that pricing on Monday.
NEUT29|Alright Megan for you from at in Chicago other than traditional safe haven assets, what other ways could you hedge or mitigate a mid term or short term drawdown?
NEUT30|Network for certain investors.
NEUT31|Something like buying a put or covered call, writing strategy, or even structured notes might be appropriate.
BULL32|Be careful here, you can bleed premium and continue paying out costs as the market continues to go up, and ultimately you may have been better off just riding through it.
BEAR33|There's also low Vol or low beta ETF so you can look into an qual quality ETF's which should lose less than the market if we see a pullback.
BULL34|"Ultimately diversification an riding through a short term pullback is probably your best bet."""
