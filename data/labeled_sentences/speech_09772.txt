NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol FCEL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, another day of selling pressure here.
NEUT5|So definitely a whole lot of updates here.
NEUT6|Need to be made as the prices once again put in lower lows first thing before anything else is going to do some house cleaning.
NEUT7|Get rid of these lines here.
NEUT8|Sure these levels still pretending that they're just not really relevant right now.
NEUT9|And from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing confusion and clutter 'cause there's lines are very long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible.
NEUT10|The 1st update that need to be made just comes out based on a foundation rule in charge, in which states 1 levels of support are broken and closed below.
NEUT11|They tend to act as resistance.
NEUT12|So $20.50 now going to be that main area to keep an eye on moving forward, and that that actually.
NEUT13|Played out perfectly as far as the rules concern price gap down below there and then you can see just struggled very much.
NEUT14|So right around that area so moving into not necessarily just Friday but over the next few days.
BULL15|If the price can try to consolidate out and then work back upwards.
NEUT16|The big question is can the price not necessarily get back up to $20.50, but more importantly can the price break above it and stay above it so you want to keep a very close eye on that area here moving into the next several days.
NEUT17|Now if the price just decides it wants to keep on moving downwards, let's try to figure out where some of these next potential areas of support are and I realized that charge is getting harder to see here, but that's just.
BEAR18|It goes to show that the price has not been down at this location for quite awhile.
NEUT19|So next area of support to keep a close eye on going to be right down there at that $18.00 mark and then after 18 if that level can hold up next the area after that let's see what's down there around 1675.
NEUT20|So 18 and 1675.
NEUT21|Next couple of key areas of support to keep an eye on.
BEAR22|But yeah, overall a brutal week every single day.
NEUT23|Just lower highs and lower lows, but we'll see if the price and try to start to get things turned around or not on Friday 1st off.
BULL24|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT26|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT27|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR32|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT36|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
