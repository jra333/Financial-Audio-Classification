NEUT0|"""What is it guys Peter call here something traders helping you grow your portfolio one trade at a time and in this video we're going to check out fubo."
NEUT1|We're going to go over Fubo where I take a look at the technical analysis.
NEUT2|Take a quick little look at some options flow that's been going on this week and today, and we're going to verify.
BULL3|I think that this is a good trade.
NEUT4|Once again, this is not a fundamental analysis of Fubo TV.
NEUT5|I might end up doing one of my main channel.
NEUT6|So if you are interested in long term investing, fundamental analysis, go and check out my main channel.
NEUT7|You can just look me up on YouTube.
NEUT8|Peter to Carlos.
NEUT9|Or you can click the main channel link down in the bottom.
BEAR10|For some reason it's been having trouble past couple of days, but I'll double check.
NEUT11|Double check and make sure that it works.
BEAR12|Overall guys Fubo has had one hell of a past year and more specifically past three months back in November we were trading all the way down at $12.50, hit a high of 6229 before aggressively pulling back down to major support.
BEAR13|Tons of volume point of control held around $27.00.
NEUT14|If you don't know what point of control is.
NEUT15|Or volume profile.
NEUT16|Essentially, these bars at the bottom are going to show you your volume, which is how many shares are being traded, but it's not going to show you at what price it's being traded at this graph.
NEUT17|Over here, it's called a volume profile.
NEUT18|This will show you at what price they're being traded at, and the cool thing is you can see this red line right here.
NEUT19|It's called point of control, which means that this is where the highest amount of volume is traded on it usually access a very very strong support and resistance, so we have a ton of volume down here at $27.50.
NEUT20|Bounced perfectly right up came back up.
NEUT21|Up up, and then pushed.
BEAR22|However, the second time here we were unable to get back up to all time highs, which is the first sign of, like a little worried.
BEAR23|The second thing too is we have a lot less volume as we're starting to decrease in our volume, especially over the past couple of days here now.
BEAR24|Another bearish thing is your RSI is pointing down your Mac D is crossing to the downside.
NEUT25|The last line of defense here, in my personal opinion, is this support at like 4450, which is kind of where we are right now.
NEUT26|Lines up with the 50 day SMAD lines up with this last little blocked right here you can see a volume on the volume profile.
BEAR27|If we cannot hold 4450, I think that we are for sure going to fall back down to 3750 at least.
NEUT28|A $40 probably hold that that hundred day or 50 damn size 50 day SMAP if we look at the flow today.
BULL29|Some good calls coming in.
NEUT30|But like sorry, moving the wrong screen, some good calls coming in, but nothing too crazy.
NEUT31|212-2020 Ones 2 nineteen 2020 ones.
NEUT32|Those are day trades for somebody who's playing to hold this for the next couple of days, they're really not going to do anything for you if we take a look at the historical and how this has looked in the past week and how the flow has been.
BEAR33|You can see overall pretty mixed.
NEUT34|Nothing too crazy.
NEUT35|Nothing that catches my eye.
NEUT36|Most of these are two 12219, so it's not like there's any big flow going out until March or April, which is really what I'd be wanting to look for if I was looking to swing trade this.
NEUT37|To overall guys.
BULL38|Keep an eye on this MA on the daily around $45.00, forty 450 right around there do have earnings coming up like 3 versus 3 one or 320 March 2nd.
NEUT39|Keep an eye on it.
NEUT40|That's the level I would be watching.
