NEUT0|"""But how big of a milestone might this be?"
NEUT1|And do you think it would really happen?
NEUT2|Will it be 2 things?
NEUT3|They would be prestige.
NEUT4|It would be kind of recognition of Elon Musk's vision and dream for the past 1617 years to bring the electrification of the automobile to the industry and to essentially rise to the ranks that he would be part of.
BULL5|You know, the benchmark index for US equities, a huge win in that regard.
NEUT6|But for the Investor, a big win, because usually the stock has either run up.
BEAR7|When they get pulled, put into the S&P 500 index funds raised to put that in there, though, the benefit might be short lived, usually about a year later, research shows of those equities then decrease in value.
NEUT8|They trail behind the S&P 500.
NEUT9|Tim.
BEAR10|Do you think there would be some reluctance because the stock price run up has been so sharp?
BEAR11|I mean wasn't the stock it was below 300.
BEAR12|Go below 200 briefly early last year.
BEAR13|This has been a huge run.
NEUT14|It makes Elon Musk like the 5th wealthiest person in the world.
NEUT15|Would that be reason for pause to say?
NEUT16|Let's make sure that this is.
NEUT17|For real, I mean, again, that's just the stock price portion.
NEUT18|The profitability should speak for itself.
NEUT19|Theoretically.
NEUT20|I just wonder if that kind of parabolic move would cause some hesitation.
NEUT21|Surely you know some investors don't want to get near Tesla.
BEAR22|Their concern about the fundamentals of the business.
NEUT23|If you look at longtime observers of the auto industry.
NEUT24|Yeah Phil, final question for the report tonight.
NEUT25|You mentioned about half a million that vehicle forecast.
NEUT26|Maybe for the year.
NEUT27|Do you think it's you know?
NEUT28|I mean, should we expect that they will put out full year guidance given the uncertainty that we're facing?
NEUT29|I'm not expecting it.
NEUT30|I think if they're not going to hit that half million target, they won't say something until late in the year because Elon Musk believes couple of things they've got going in their favor.
NEUT31|One they got a half a year to make up for any potential shortfall where they might be in terms of their internal targets.
BULL32|And two China continues to expand in terms of production and in terms of deliveries.
NEUT33|So they are that's momentum on their side that Giga Factory in Shanghai and the deliveries over there.
BULL34|Alright Phil thank you thanks to Tim as well.
NEUT35|"Bring with us that Tim Higgins and Phil about."""
