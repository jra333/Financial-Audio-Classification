NEUT0|"""Pollo loco take a look here at GameStop on the daily and."
NEUT1|Said some interesting here the.
NEUT2|Open Chuck Kettler channel.
BULL3|Crossing into the Bolinger pans for the first time.
NEUT4|So anytime I've seen that this seems to be their high volatility, up or down.
NEUT5|Now it seems to work like if it's on a downtrend.
NEUT6|Seems to follow that trend for some reason when it's an uptrend.
NEUT7|So it's kind of an up and down, isn't it?
NEUT8|But it's it's hard to say where the stones headed right now, so.
NEUT9|If you look over here, we're not getting any calls for this stock, but we are sure getting a lot over here #17.
BEAR10|So it's interesting the Mac D over here on the far left is crashing.
NEUT11|Stochastics filling up.
NEUT12|And the.
BEAR13|Yeah, it looks like this might go down.
NEUT14|It's hard to say.
NEUT15|The RSI is bullish 54.
NEUT16|So I need a lot of people that come in on this fine for it to get reasonable, but looks like the odds are against it right now.
NEUT17|On the 15 minute we are getting a lot of buying just above, whoops.
BULL18|Just above where it's at, so that's good, but that should return to the money.
BEAR19|Power surge sorrows on the downswing.
NEUT20|See the view up over here is.
BULL21|Polish, so that's good.
NEUT22|But the.
NEUT23|That makde crashing on the one minute.
NEUT24|No, I don't know just looking over the charts and.
NEUT25|Not really, give an opinion about your soul on this one.
BULL26|Hope that helps though.
NEUT27|Switch it to the five minute.
NEUT28|See where the money is on the five minute.
NEUT29|This yellow represents the most buying and selling at that area.
NEUT30|So, huh, always kind of crushing.
NEUT31|Or selling and buying over here.
NEUT32|No longer could drop it drop.
BEAR33|I'm gonna say it's going to drop in the morning.
NEUT34|Alright.
BULL35|Good luck to ya.
BULL36|"Hope that helps."""
