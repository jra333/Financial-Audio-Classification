BEAR0|"""The market is so funny the market acts."
BULL1|It's up 20% for the bottom.
NEUT2|The Marketaxess we're bout to have opening day and now we're thinking about having to update according to Spin in Phoenix and all games played in Phoenix.
BULL3|That that's a terrific idea.
NEUT4|If you lived in Phoenix, but we're sitting here watching interest rates go high on buy stocks going up again.
NEUT5|And I don't know there's a curious disconnect between when you speak to the companies, most of which are closed and what's going on in the market today.
NEUT6|And I find it.
NEUT7|I keep thinking maybe the market knows something we don't.
NEUT8|Maybe they know of oven antiviral?
NEUT9|I mean David, you know you got a minute.
NEUT10|Yes you do have to think that they are.
NEUT11|The market knows something that we don't know.
NEUT12|The collective wisdom and I spoke to Dave Tepper yesterday and we're both kind of marveling.
BEAR13|Geez, it's been bullish.
NEUT14|Why?
NEUT15|I listen, I have those same conversations during the course of the day as well, and to your point, the collective wisdom of the market, perhaps sightseeing something that is that is a positive.
NEUT16|Maybe it is simply the rate of infection, or the rate of hospitalizations in New York slowing.
NEUT17|The idea that we are going to reopen at some point, but most of the conversations I have end up with somebody saying no one knows what it looks like when we come out of this right.
NEUT18|No one knows anything.
NEUT19|I mean, it sort of ends up there regardless of your expertise.
NEUT20|Regardless of how detailed you are in rigorous, you are in terms of all aspects of the economy.
NEUT21|Nobody seems to know much of anything in terms of what's really coming, Jim.
BEAR22|I guess that's a difficult thing to say, but the market seems to say it's not going to be perhaps as bad as been feared a couple of weeks ago, right?
NEUT23|I mean it.
NEUT24|One of the things that's incredibly go back to think about 2008, 2009 to 2007.
NEUT25|Nobody could get any credit.
BEAR26|I mean, I remember thinking, geez, look at that Caterpillar commercial credit line is not going to be in trouble now.
NEUT27|It's like, hey you want some credit, you want some money?
NEUT28|I mean, when Carnival Cruise raised all that money, what's the while there?
BEAR29|There's a criminal investigation about a cruise ship.
BEAR30|There are 600 people were sick and eleven died.
NEUT31|It doesn't that say David, that?
NEUT32|Pretty much anybody can get money.
NEUT33|"I mean, isn't that like your world's most borrower?"""
