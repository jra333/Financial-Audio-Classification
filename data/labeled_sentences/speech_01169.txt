BULL0|"""So they had the strongest grocery sales in the most in nine years."
NEUT1|What was the main driver of that?
NEUT2|Yeah, that's absolutely right.
BULL3|They've really been working to refresh their grocery offering, refresh the fresh food actually in their grocery offering.
BULL4|Their sales were up the best sales for grocery in nine years that fed into a really good post for comparative sales.
NEUT5|Take a look at the Bloomberg here.
BULL6|I've got a G chart for you, which shows Walmart posted its largest sales growth in a decade.
BULL7|At Walmart, same store sales over 4 1/2 percent there today and analysts have hailed it as a banner quarter and a lot of them have pointed towards grocery.
BULL8|It's an area they've really been aggressively defending themselves against.
NEUT9|Amazon after Amazon bought Whole Foods, Walmart has the biggest share of the grocery aisle, about 25.6%.
NEUT10|Amazon doesn't even make the top five of the US gross is just yet.
NEUT11|They've.
BULL12|As I said, they've been refreshing refreshing their food offerings.
NEUT13|But they've also be really been focusing.
NEUT14|On click and collect that's online orders that you can then pick up in store and CEO Doug Mcmillon saying they were aggressively pursuing that strategy.
NEUT15|You can now click and collect in 1800 at Walmart stores across the US.
NEUT16|You might remember that Amazon only just recently announced that they would be offering that service in some of their whole food stores, right?
BULL17|Walmart has clearly been very aggressive.
NEUT18|They have this click and collect.
NEUT19|They have curbside pickup.
NEUT20|But how does this compare to Amazon's offerings in terms of what they offer?
NEUT21|I mean, we're still waiting to hear a lot more about what Amazon.
NEUT22|Are going to be doing with Whole Foods.
NEUT23|Of course.
NEUT24|One of the things that a lot of analysts were saying when Amazon reported earnings earlier in the season was at Whole Foods.
NEUT25|Wasn't really mentioned.
NEUT26|A tall.
BULL27|And when it comes to Walmart and E Commerce, which is obviously another area where you can see a direct comparison between the two, you mentioned that they saw e-commerce growth of 40% at last quarter and that was compared to the second quarter of last year, where Walmarts or e-commerce growth of more than 60%.
BULL28|So the fact that they returned to 40% on a bigger base suggests, and that's a more impressive result for Walmart.
NEUT29|One other winner here is the Walton family.
NEUT30|Their their biggest shareholders in Walmart.
NEUT31|The wealthiest family in America, and they just became a whole lot wealthier and today's stock move putting $11.6 billion.
BULL32|In addition, in additional wealth for the Waltons.
NEUT33|What about challenges in the back half of the year?
NEUT34|Was there any discussion about concerns around tariffs or changing consumer sentiment?
NEUT35|That hasn't tariffs is something that and warmer and a number of retailers say they are watching their slightly.
NEUT36|They're concerned because it creates uncertainty, but there's not a lot that's been that massively effects consumer product right now.
NEUT37|One of the things that Walmart is trying to do, or looking at very closely is at the cost of household items.
BEAR38|So transportation and labor costs are sort of pushing up the price of household items, like paper towels like diapers and things like that, and obviously one of the things that.
NEUT39|Walmart is known for its low prices and they don't really want to have to pass on those increase costs to their customers.
BULL40|'cause obviously if they did, that also creates another opportunity for Amazon who can also offer at all.
BULL41|"Can also try and beat them on price there."""
