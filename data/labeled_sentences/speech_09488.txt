NEUT0|"""Of Apple this morning without form rating and a price target of $171.00."
BULL1|Good to see.
BULL2|Much thanks so much for for joining us.
NEUT3|I mean, let's start on that particular topic about whether Apple should start to get it more broadly into the crypto space.
NEUT4|Bitcoin in particular, and whether you think it could be an opportunity for them.
NEUT5|Yeah, so I really do believe this is a pretty clear opportunity in my opinion, because if you look at squares R&D budget, they spend about $670 million per year Apple spends or sorry generates cash flow of that amount in less than two and a half days.
NEUT6|So the amount of R&D expenses would hit it would take to kind of create a crypto exchange for them.
NEUT7|Just to be clear, they don't even need to own any crypto assets, they could just create an exchange.
NEUT8|And if you run that map coin base right now is going public through a direct listing right?
NEUT9|And their value to 50 two $80 billion with only 35 million.
NEUT10|People as their install base.
NEUT11|Apple has a 1.5 billion installed base and they sell 200,000,000 phones per year.
NEUT12|So what prevents Apple from utilizing its best asset?
NEUT13|Which is software, it closed ecosystem and basically putting people onto a crypto wallet and then making money off the fees?
NEUT14|So again there's been a lot of news here saying that I think they should buy and all this other stuff, but really the clear message is why can't they just become an exchange?
NEUT15|Use this software and just get fees based on the exchange of crypto assets.
NEUT16|I don't think that cryptocurrency is going away anytime soon, and so if they just simply become the exchange, it's a low risk way.
NEUT17|Then the utilized most valuable part of their asset which is security and software.
NEUT18|Do you expect this to happen?
NEUT19|You reporting on this based on on any expectations.
NEUT20|Anything you've heard from the company or is just your analysis of an opportunity that they have.
NEUT21|This is just solely my entire analysis file.
NEUT22|If I was working at Apple's strategy Officer, this is legitimately something I would do, because if you can invest $500 million to potentially create 50 to $80 billion in equity value, that's a lot more compelling to me than trying to compete against an Elon Musk and Tesla, a distributed energy company.
NEUT23|We're going to spend 15 to $20 billion just for a maybe just for.
NEUT24|Full disclosure here.
NEUT25|I do own GB TC and test, so I don't want people to.
NEUT26|I believe that I'm trying to make any sort of nefarious activity here, and it's like that, but it just doesn't make any logical sense right?
NEUT27|If you have a 200,000,000 person install base and you can create value out of that with just creating a small exchange, why wouldn't you do it so?
NEUT28|So far the feedback for invested I've got is that it sounds like it's out of left field.
NEUT29|But again, if you don't think that exchanges are going away any soon anytime soon, why wouldn't you do this?
NEUT30|Well, I think 2 reasons one it could open you up to all kinds of new regulatory scrutiny when they're all focused on Bitcoin becoming a Bitcoin exchange.
BULL31|But also, I mean, you're assuming the big gains if the price continues to go up, which I'm not sure that that's necessarily.
NEUT32|I a universal idea, a lot of people still think this is a massive bubble, and it's worth nothing.
NEUT33|So again, they don't even have to own the Bitcoin, right?
NEUT34|So that second part I don't agree with that.
NEUT35|What I'm saying is they can basically just be the exchange, but say you wanted to buy a big corner fraction of a Bitcoin.
NEUT36|Just going here Apple one you click buy they take a .01% fee or something small right?
NEUT37|Then at that point you just making money on the exchange and in terms of the regulatory part task, those involved now squares involved.
NEUT38|Now you also got micro strategy involves right PayPal is involved, they did it legally right in a closed system.
NEUT39|Again a closed system guarantees.
NEUT40|That you can't take something off the exchange because they're keeping it within the ecosystem, so why wouldn't they be able to do the same thing?
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
