NEUT0|"""Hello, Short meeting once again from shortmeeting.com doing a video recap for Amazon ticker AMZN."
NEUT1|Right now what?
NEUT2|You're looking at the daily chart dating back to around.
NEUT3|I want to say November of 2017, but let's focus in on price action here.
BULL4|Start got upgraded investors poured in stock broke out.
NEUT5|We are close today at 1998 but I think we have some movements in after hours were about it 2000.
NEUT6|So clearly this stock looks like it's ready to leave the station.
NEUT7|Well, we can conclude that left the station many many years ago.
BULL8|But even Despite that it looks like it's about to put up more gains based on investors running into the stock today.
NEUT9|Based on the upgrade.
NEUT10|And based on this candle.
BULL11|We closed a precisely at the highs.
NEUT12|That means that you know everyone is extremely bullish.
NEUT13|Not everyone.
BULL14|But there's a lot of bullish sentiment on ticker AMZN.
NEUT15|I see based on the chart, I see an extra 100 to 200 points from here.
NEUT16|Meaning that I think that Amazon can want to around 2200.
NEUT17|Full disclosure, we're not in this trade.
NEUT18|Why, well?
NEUT19|Because support for me comes in around here around 1600.
NEUT20|So if I jump in the Trader 2000, right?
NEUT21|I'm risking 400 to make 200.
NEUT22|Those odds don't work in my favor or it doesn't work for me, but if you're looking for, but I do have another trade idea, right?
NEUT23|If you don't want to spend $2000 on his doc and you're looking for another stock to get in right consider ticker GLW Corning.
NEUT24|I actually like the stock Y.
NEUT25|Let's pay attention.
BEAR26|We have a rounding bottom here gap up long candle.
BULL27|A break out on above average volume and the stock is consolidating.
BULL28|Another most recent breakout, and we're about to our test.
NEUT29|I believe it's all time highs of $35, right?
NEUT30|Also, sitting here at 33.
NEUT31|Granted, I'm not saying $2.00 is all it can get.
BULL32|I feel we're going to hit 235, which is about 2 two points upside from here.
NEUT33|Pull back and we're going to carry on, right?
NEUT34|So for me, my projection for ticker GLW is about $44, so that's about 40% upside from here.
NEUT35|An extra 11 points or so.
NEUT36|So again, consider GLW if you're looking for a trade idea.
NEUT37|Rounding bottom that took about.
NEUT38|Eight months of complete gapped up consolidation, I think the stock is ready to run, so that's it shortly consulting.com bring you guys a video anyway if you enjoy any parties video do two things for me.
