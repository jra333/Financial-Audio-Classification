BULL0|"""You are so right this time Jim about getting to where we are now."
BEAR1|An all along he thought the reopening trade could usher in this year maybe a 20% pullback and I think you still think that my question is with what I'm starting to think of are maybe some long term headwinds.
NEUT2|Whether it's taxes, regulation, rising interest rates, whatever you want to call it, where they may have passed the second derivative on some of those things you think we come back from that correction to new highs.
NEUT3|Or could this be a time where maybe we pause after an unbelievable advance?
NEUT4|These last couple of years?
NEUT5|Yeah, so that's I definitely think we're going to correction, and I think it's just going to be really hard to call whether that's now spooked about yields.
BULL6|I guess I kind of think it might be a little later this year after more people are vaccinated and we're extremely giddy, Sean, both Main Street and Wall Street about being able to roam freely and opening up businesses again, and that could come a correction from higher levels than we are now.
NEUT7|And I think that's kind of my guess, but I wouldn't be shocked if it happened now.
BULL8|But I I still lean towards the view that you know, we're one year into an economic recovery.
NEUT9|One year into a bull market.
NEUT10|This is probably a multi year event an you know there's nothing too uncommon here.
NEUT11|What we're doing when recovery begins.
BEAR12|Eventually, bond yields react to the better economic data, and that typically causes a hiccup in the stock market for a period.
NEUT13|But that hiccup is usually a buying opportunity because.
NEUT14|We start to get used to wherever the yield sort of average in again, and then there's another period of rising stock market against an economy and economic recovery that's sustainable, and I think that's going to probably happen here, so you think, I mean, elections have consequences.
NEUT15|You think the freewheeling spending, the stimulus?
NEUT16|the Fed counteracts any of what other more?
NEUT17|I don't know whether they're you know more.
NEUT18|Old fashioned, but things like regulation in higher taxes.
BEAR19|You think that the stimulus and the freewheeling spending Trump's any of those other headwinds and the market goes up.
NEUT20|It's interesting use, trumped.
NEUT21|I know you're from Minnesota, the land of Humphrey and Mondale, and so I know how you think you think this is great, but.
BEAR22|Well, you know, joy I, I think there's definitely been overuse and abuse of policy's here, both monetary and fiscal, an I am unsure what that'll mean, and I certainly will re look at that later.
NEUT23|You know, as we this time next year, it could be a more serious problem and might have to adjust what I just said with that.
NEUT24|But I would say this.
NEUT25|Look, we.
NEUT26|I think back in the 1950s and 60s we often had seven to 10% nominal GDP growth.
BULL27|We had five to 7 or 8% real GDP growth in the 50s and much of the 60s.
NEUT28|And yet we had a yield structure 10 year yield, which was 2 1/2 to 4 1/2 most of the time.
BULL29|So my point is, it is possible that we could get a period of much better growth than we've had for many decades, perhaps and still have a yield environment which stays fairly hospitable and inflation does as well.
NEUT30|I I'm not going to.
NEUT31|I'm not going to necessarily reject that view right now.
NEUT32|That's possible.
NEUT33|I think.
NEUT34|It's also possible that inflation gets out of control, and taxes and everything else.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
