NEUT0|"""Might look at the credit users is not a surprise at all and it shouldn't be to anybody who's been paying attention."
NEUT1|It's simply impossible for one state.
BEAR2|Define Crown was an improper person to use the jargon to hold a license.
NEUT3|And yet in up to other states that that that must remain unchallenged, or at least uninspected.
NEUT4|It would have been just would have bigger belief that the one jurisdiction and in a similar you know it was different overseas.
NEUT5|Maybe you make the argument that things are different here, just too hard to say that it wouldn't have happened.
NEUT6|I'm a little bit surprised.
NEUT7|Taken this long, I would've thought maybe a day or two after that.
BULL8|Decision NSW we may have seen action in Victoria and WA look.
NEUT9|It's not going to be an issue for the for the license.
NEUT10|I think what everyone's expecting it.
NEUT11|This might be wrong.
NEUT12|Everyone's expecting the Crown will in a rap over the knuckles.
NEUT13|Again be told it's going again.
NEUT14|It will show evidence that already making some changes.
NEUT15|Maybe it gets some sort of provisional licensing regime until it proves its due and capable.
NEUT16|But I think we already know that's happening adult NSW.
NEUT17|Anyway, this is largely the other sites having to make sure the ticking those boxes OK just to job seek.
NEUT18|It looks like there's going to be an announcement at some point.
NEUT19|Today is Scott.
NEUT20|What the new number is we don't know.
BEAR21|Currently, at $40 a day, its allies are Edwards.
NEUT22|On a short time ago saying it's going to be less than 51 a costs had wanted in excess of $60.00 a day.
NEUT23|That looks like it's going to be way off but but what do you think is about the right number?
NEUT24|Change of the old school based bargaining isn't the employees go with one number of years ago with another and then the Commission find somewhere in between we should be at all surprised at this at this game is played.
NEUT25|It's like house auctions right here.
NEUT26|If you want to ride, you put it unreasonably big number.
NEUT27|You hope that somewhere in between.
NEUT28|If you want nothing, you go for nothing and now you have to pay something.
BULL29|Look, I think I think a small but reasonable increases about right?
BULL30|I think that 4546 you mentioned earlier that would be a good result for everybody.
BULL31|I think it's good for people on those allowances.
BULL32|Also good news for the economy.
BULL33|I think even if you don't think the the rate should be increased on equity level and you could have that view.
NEUT34|The reality is, people on this level are gonna put that money straight back into the economy.
NEUT35|So even if you don't like the fact they're getting some more money, and I understand that you I don't necessarily agree with, but I understand it that money goes back into the economy anyway and hopefully get spent in businesses around the world around the country, should say and make sure that that that underscores employment.
NEUT36|And so it really is.
NEUT37|If the government is going to be paying out more money, you want that money as as a pure economic case to go to people who most likely then push it back into the economy.
NEUT38|Just wanted Wiki or put in the bank account.
NEUT39|So thank you very much.
NEUT40|You give some more money to to welfare recipients are most likely to spend it.
BULL41|And that at least is good news for the economy.
NEUT42|OK. And just finally, Scott reporting week continues.
NEUT43|Anything you've got your eye specifically on this week.
NEUT44|Looking for the banquet Maybank stuff yesterday was fascinating in terms of the need to bulk up JP Morgan was out this morning talking about dividend super cycle two in the Finn.
NEUT45|I think that story is probably one that will see rolling out.
BEAR46|So really looking at dividend levels across most of the the majors and energy as well, we saw a joke about the $2.7 billion right down last week.
BULL47|Energy Australia's owners DPL come out today and said they expect tougher conditions moving forward because of low wholesale energy prices.
NEUT48|So again, that the broad economic settings that drive those things.
NEUT49|The impact on the banks and insurers in particular to remain probably front of mind.
BULL50|The good news, of course, is retail doing really, really well.
NEUT51|"This earnings season, OK?"""
