NEUT0|"""The program that we do with XL hybrids."
NEUT1|We did a two year test before we actually went.
NEUT2|Full commitment and presented that to senior leadership to show that the return was there and there are a lot of different ways to measure that return.
NEUT3|You can measure through.
NEUT4|Obviously just fuel is the biggest one, but also carbon emission reduction and then also the PR that we would get from this type of type of technology.
NEUT5|More like a social license if you will.
NEUT6|Of being able to promote having vans and trucks running around that are hybrids, it is something different that is not traditionally in this space.
NEUT7|"And being a kind of a leader in that space."""
