BULL0|"""So I've talked about this talk 2 weeks back, Anna since then it has already up by 20%, but this is not a thing which we are going to discuss over here, but definitely I would suggest you to check out my previous videos along with this video."
NEUT1|Now what we're going to discuss here?
NEUT2|We are going to discuss about the trajectory or the target that we are looking for in this particular stock on the long term, solar friends.
BULL3|Welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video.
NEUT4|Friends in this video we are going to discuss about the long term chart of Guardian Health Sciences.
NEUT5|Let me tell you that we have very limited data for this particular stock, so we're not going to go beyond the data, so there is no way we're doing.
NEUT6|Imaginable, forecasting Newcastle are forecasting or the trend analysis is limited.
NEUT7|As for the data.
NEUT8|Now let's go to the line chart for a time being.
NEUT9|So what you can see here.
NEUT10|Specifically toward three things, let me tell you so.
NEUT11|This is 1 and you have this one as well.
NEUT12|And probably this one.
NEUT13|So let's get back to the candle stick.
NEUT14|Now what we'll see here.
NEUT15|So.
BEAR16|This was the resistance that the stock has recently crossed at $0.58.
NEUT17|Then you have 3034 cents and you have $0.16.
BULL18|On the downside, I would say $0.58 will be a decent stop.
BEAR19|So if the stock falls below 58 cents, one should be very sceptical about the trade and the trend as well.
NEUT20|OK, now what you need to do here.
NEUT21|You gonna specifically look at 2 levels?
NEUT22|OK, you have your first level at here.
NEUT23|We have $0.84, then you'll have.
NEUT24|$0.98 OK, those who are a bit sceptical or risk averse.
NEUT25|Then they can use $0.98 or $1.00 if the stock crossed $1.00 then there will be a big rise.
NEUT26|Then if somebody can take their position with a stop loss at 58 since it's fine, OK, so this will be a two targets, but what what we're looking at here?
BULL27|That if the crosstalk sustained above $0.98 or $1.00, then.
NEUT28|Then we have a target.
NEUT29|Which will lead us to or in between.
NEUT30|2.24 An probably our big target will be at 3.15.
NEUT31|So these are the two or three targets that we're specifically looking at in this particular stock over the next couple of weeks, as well as couple of months.
NEUT32|So this is the end of the video.
