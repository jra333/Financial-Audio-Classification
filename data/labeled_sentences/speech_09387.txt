NEUT0|"""Hey guys and welcome back to another video on the channel if you're interested in keeping up with the best stocks to buy now."
NEUT1|Going forward, make sure you hit that subscribe button because I post daily before the stock market opens each day, so this is the best time to look at stocks to buy.
NEUT2|So in this video we're going to be looking at spenn and my price prediction going forward.
NEUT3|So SPE stands for Switch back Energy which their company out of Texas and they're about to have a merger with charge point which is going to be huge.
NEUT4|They're going to be merging with Chargepoint on December 15th.
NEUT5|So what the company does essentially is they are working on making a network of electric.
NEUT6|Charging stations.
BULL7|So I think this company has a lot of room to grow, especially as the EV sector continues to grow, especially over the next couple of years, with more regulations coming in and the expansion of EV cars as they become more widely used.
NEUT8|So these charging stations are essentially what gas stations currently are.
NEUT9|I like to use the comparison for this situation of back to the gold Rush in California in 1848, where the smart people weren't the ones that all left everything behind.
NEUT10|Going over to look for gold is the people over there that were selling shovels and things that they needed to mine.
NEUT11|I say this is the example because of the gold rush, kind of like the EV sector.
NEUT12|The gold rush.
NEUT13|As soon as everyone as soon as gold was found, everyone sold all their stuff and went over there and a lot of people didn't find anything or not enough to make back what they had given up to come there.
BULL14|I do think there's a lot of very good EV car companies out there that are going to succeed, just not all of them are going to exceed.
NEUT15|I see Nio and Tesla being the main ones, although there are going to be some more that probably survive.
NEUT16|I just see this is like the clear.
NEUT17|Winner I see them teaming up with whichever EV company pretty much wins.
NEUT18|Like how does I guess that's how you can say it.
NEUT19|I see them teaming up with whoever becomes the predominant EV car distributor.
BULL20|So looking at the chart for SP over the last week or so, we did go up a lot.
BULL21|We're currently at around $37 and I do think this will continue to go up a little bit more until we get to the merger on December 15th.
NEUT22|So as far as how high the stock can go, I think right now this is even at this high price.
NEUT23|It may not be the best short term to buy in case it dips, but I do think long term it's really not going to matter what price you buy a just because I see this thing going to at least 200 three $100 in the upcoming years.
NEUT24|So as long as you're holding long term for this.
BULL25|This is definitely a winner.
NEUT26|Alright, so that's going to bring us to the end of the video as far as where I see us going within the next two years, I could see us getting up to about 300, three $150 for this stock.
BULL27|So I do think this is going to be a very good stock.
NEUT28|And finally, the end things off.
NEUT29|Do remember, I'm not a financial advisor, so everything you see on here is just for entertainment.
NEUT30|Although I personally investing in these companies.
NEUT31|Make sure before you invest in a stock.
NEUT32|"Make sure you do your own research and that you're happy with what you see in the financial numbers of that company and the future outlook."""
