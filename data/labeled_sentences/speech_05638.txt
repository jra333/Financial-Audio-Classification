NEUT1|This is showing us the ES mini for a 5 hour time frame because as prices taking out resistance, what will happen to bullish moves?
NEUT2|Price will take out resistance but won't take out support in bearish moves.
NEUT3|What we will see is price will begin trading below support the black dashed line and won't take out resistance now I always have a 2 bar rule when one area gets broken I wait for another bar in order to confirm that.
