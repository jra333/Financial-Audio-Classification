NEUT0|"""The triple top is again a reversal pattern, and it forms from a previous uptrend."
BEAR1|So when you have the previous uptrend and it's going to be a reversal, that means it's a bearish pattern.
NEUT2|So here's kind of what happens with the triple top.
NEUT3|Let's say here's our triple tops.
NEUT4|Going to happen so we have this uptrend that's happening with our stock.
BULL5|We hit one top.
BULL6|It's going.
NEUT7|We had a second top and again just like with the triple Bottom Now it starts to resemble multiple things or multiple patterns so you want to be careful up until that point it hits that triple triple top.
NEUT8|You want to be aware that it can be multiple of patterns, so that's our support line.
NEUT9|Here's our resistance line.
NEUT10|And again, you're watching it for that break.
NEUT11|Once it breaks right here.
NEUT12|Under the support line, then you can enter the trade to the downside, or sell it short again with volume you want to see that volume.
BULL13|You'll probably see it Spike a little bit in this area during the highs.
BULL14|You know a little bit on the highs, but really the volume should definitely spike more once it breaks the.
NEUT15|That's support line.
BULL16|OK, so once it breaks, that volume will increase.
NEUT17|Otherwise it's just kind of hanging around.
NEUT18|Right here.
NEUT19|You know a lot less so watch for that volume increase when it breaks the support line.
NEUT20|Now the other thing to remember is again, this is probably three to six months.
NEUT21|Time Horizon so keep an eye out on that time frame.
NEUT22|OK, make sure that the previous trend is from an uptrend 'cause it's signaling you know high levels now, so that's kind of the triple top.
NEUT23|Again, keep it neutral 'cause it could be a sideways pattern or it could resemble multiple other patterns up until the point that it's hitting triple tops and now you're starting to eliminate your choices.
NEUT24|Kind of for what kind of pattern it can be, but again, the stocks.
NEUT25|They could be going kind of sideways here and you don't know, so just understand.
NEUT26|Be neutral up until the point that it breaks and you're kind of watching for volume confirmation doesn't have to have that volume, but it's good to have that confirmation, so that's the triple top.
