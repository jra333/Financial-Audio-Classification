NEUT0|"""Hi guys, welcome back to another video because you're having a fantastic day and before I get started this when I'm going to quickly mention that the link to my discord in description or day trading calls for trading options every single morning as well as a few swing trades and a nightly watch list."
NEUT1|So if that's something you're interested, feel free to check that out.
NEUT2|Other than that, let's get right into this video.
BULL3|So as you can see here today I'm going over Virgin Galactic Holdings ticker symbol SPCE on the day they are currently up 22.21%, which is a $3.65 move to the upside.
NEUT4|Ring them at $20.10.
NEUT5|We take a look at the weekly chart.
NEUT6|You can see that they were pretty flat in the past week, trying between the 1650 and 1590 range.
NEUT7|If we take a look at the three month chart you can see they were much higher on July 23rd they were $27.08 and personally I do own shares of them on my other trading account.
BULL8|I am pretty bullish on them and I do believe in them for the long term.
NEUT9|They're going completely untapped industry and have a ton of potential if we take a look at the reason behind the movement.
BEAR10|Today guys is because of Bank of America.
NEUT11|They gave them a buy rating and a $35 price target.
BULL12|Which is an upgrade of 113% from their clothes on Friday.
BULL13|As you can see, investors took that in a positive way, of course, and they were up as much as 16% on Monday.
BULL14|As you can see at the high today at 10:45, there were up 22.37%.
NEUT15|If we take a look a little bit deeper, guys to do a little bit more analysis here you can see the reasons why I am so bullish on them are listed in this article.
NEUT16|As you can see, the first one being a lack of competition.
NEUT17|There are only competitor has never flown passengers and they are planning to send passengers up to space pretty soon.
NEUT18|We take a look at #2.
NEUT19|Here you can see they have a ton of growth potential.
NEUT20|That's what I've always said guys.
NEUT21|I bought shares around these 16 to $17.00 range and I plan to hold them for a few years.
NEUT22|As you can see, the long term opportunities in space tourism and hypersonic point to point travel or revenue revolutionary.
NEUT23|As you can see there, I do think that this one like I keep saying has a ton of potential along with a bunch of EV companies.
NEUT24|That is my long term portfolio.
BULL25|If you take a look at #3 here you can see that they do have a pretty strong management team.
NEUT26|May have some NASA experience as well as some Disney experience as well.
NEUT27|If you take a look at #4 here guys.
NEUT28|You can see that they do have pretty innovative technology and as you can see by this quote right here, they are unparalleled.
NEUT29|I agree with that without Bank of America statement, there's no company in the world that designs and builds its own aircraft end to end and then operates that vehicle commercially.
NEUT30|It's pretty crazy guys, that they are trying to send the average Joe up to space.
NEUT31|No company has ever attempted to do something like that, and I do think that this will be a very profitable business long term.
NEUT32|They are just kind of in the developing stages, which is why they've been fluctuating between these ranges for a long time, but it's crazy.
NEUT33|Think that this company right now is trading under $20.
NEUT34|A share has so much potential.
NEUT35|I could see them being well over $100 years and years down the road lyrics.
NEUT36|The risks with this company.
NEUT37|Though guys are that there are no other similar companies that based evaluation off of and things like that you don't really get a better yeah, good understanding of how it relates to other companies.
NEUT38|Other companies in the industry because it really is the only company in its industry.
NEUT39|If you take a look at more of the technical charts today on the daily chart here I take a look in.
NEUT40|Zoom in over here you can see it tested the upper view.
NEUT41|Earlier today, about 10:42, it was rejected.
NEUT42|Bounce around here, bounced off.
BEAR43|The lower VWAP is kind of on a bit of a rally.
BULL44|Once again the RSI was a little bit high here on this giant green candle that pushed them up to about 2013.
NEUT45|I do think that they will run into the closing potentially in after hours.
BULL46|They could see some strong movement again tomorrow.
NEUT47|It could be a multi day runner as you can see there's a small bull flag actually forming right here, but other than that guys that is about it for this video.
