NEUT1|They are judging according to appearances.
NEUT2|The people that are going to make it in the future.
NEUT3|The people that are making it today let me share something with you.
NEUT4|History is being read, but it's also being written by people with imagination.
NEUT5|It's not fair.
NEUT6|You take responsibility for that.
NEUT7|You make it happen that you don't give up, that you don't take any objection or disappointment or defeats personally, that you keep on keeping on that.
NEUT8|You don't decide that I can't make it because you can't see the light at the end of the tunnel that you realize that the part of the program.
NEUT9|You must have faith.
NEUT10|You gotta believe in yourself.
NEUT11|You've got to believe in your abilities.
NEUT12|You got to believe in your service, your company, your ideas.
NEUT13|Unquestionably, you gotta have faith and that faith gives you patience.
NEUT14|That is not going to happen as quickly as you want it to happen.
NEUT15|When you got an idea you want to move on, you might not have the money.
NEUT16|You might not have the education you might not have the support or resources you need.
NEUT17|What is that something?
BULL18|That can keep us going.
BULL19|That will enable us to act on our dream.
NEUT20|What's one of those keys and will begin to help us to discover the secrets to our green?
NEUT21|Here's what I want you to repeat after me please with power and conviction.
NEUT22|"Say it's possible."""
