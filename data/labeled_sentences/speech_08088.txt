NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Erin Miller with The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|Solar stocks have had a rough go of it over the past few weeks, joining me now to discuss is solar Investor an Motley Fool.
NEUT2|Contributor Travis Hoium so Travis wipe away the tears and tell us what is happening with the solar industry.
BEAR3|Well, this is really a broad sell off in filler stocks right now and there's not any huge driver of it that's a little bit frustrating as a solar investor myself, but I think we need.
NEUT4|You know this is one of those opportunities that we can take a step back and look at where the industry is.
NEUT5|Right now.
NEUT6|There's.
NEUT7|There's actually a lot of really positive things happening, you know.
BEAR8|A year ago there was there was, companies were reporting losses all over the industry.
BULL9|Now we've actually seen a return to profitability for a lot of these companies.
NEUT10|First, solar and SunPower are really leading the way from in the US.
BULL11|Other module makers and there both reporting pretty solid profits right now.
NEUT12|Actually trade it.
NEUT13|Pretty reasonable multiples as well for investors.
BEAR14|Solar City is growing like gangbusters.
BULL15|They're expected to grow their installations almost 90% next year and then you even have Chinese companies.
BULL16|Manufacturers who are returning to profitability with great great sign over there.
BULL17|Trina Solar just reported a profit, single filler, profitable for the second quarter in row in Canadian Solar was actually the best performer out of the solar industry this year.
NEUT18|Just returning.
BULL19|Profit well, so you know that's that's a lot of great progress with the solar needs to be something we need to keep in mind.
BEAR20|Even even though the socks are pulling back with it now, I think there's some negativity at there's a few companies that didn't do quite as well as expected.
NEUT21|Complete like being interviewed, but but you know, overall there's a lot of positive going on the solar industry, and that's something we need to keep in mind.
BULL22|This may actually be a great buying opportunity for investors.
BEAR23|OK now third quarter earnings season is about over.
NEUT24|How did the industry look and who are you going to be watching going forward?
BULL25|Well, I mean overall the industry looks great.
BULL26|Depends a huge driver of kind of the return to profitability right now in a few companies that I'm going to watch going forward.
BULL27|You know, some power is really going to be a key in, and the reason that I use them as kind of a litmus test for the industry is you can kind of watch how the residential spaces looking in the US, How margins are doing in Japan as well as Europe so you know they've seen a lot of improvement across the board.
NEUT28|They also have exposure to the utility space.
NEUT29|That's where first Solar is really generating their profits in there doing very well signing projects as well.
NEUT30|So you know, I think a couple areas to keep an eye on the US, Japan, we need to see if they change anything with the feeding tariff, and then how fast is the Chinese market pick up?
NEUT31|That's a market that they're planning to install 35 gigawatts by 2015.
NEUT32|That was a huge amount of solar control in that time, and we haven't quite seen the revenue pick up there in China.
NEUT33|So you know, training Trina, Solar, Yingli, green energy.
NEUT34|Those are companies that are going to.
NEUT35|Really benefited China, so those are a couple of stocks to watch in that region.
