NEUT0|"""Good evening everyone, Steve here from the turtlefollower.com."
NEUT1|In this video we're going to take a quick look at a long trade setup in Avy Avery Dennison Corp.
NEUT2|These are people who make the labels and all those stuff that you find in Staples, but.
BULL3|And what we're looking at here is a nice continuation of trend on the weekly chart.
BULL4|OK, so here's our trend line coming right through this area and you can see we've consolidated for a better part of about three to four months in this consolidation.
NEUT5|And now you could see.
BULL6|It looks like we're getting ready to go ahead and actually start the next leg.
NEUT7|Alright, so here you can see it consolidated again for three or four months.
NEUT8|Broke out, you know, a nice four week move.
NEUT9|Now here we are again.
NEUT10|Starting this breakout probably maybe a week or so in.
NEUT11|So maybe we have three more weeks left.
NEUT12|But again, you know that at this point you want to belong the trade rights trading above the 200 day moving average trendline is trending higher.
NEUT13|Alright, so now it's the point of finding a good reasonable risk reward.
NEUT14|And with that there is the consolidation again on the daily chart this time, and here is a potential.
NEUT15|Trendline alright, so we've identified this previously in the past.
NEUT16|You could see my lines here, my annotation, and they finally had that breakout back here on the 30th.
NEUT17|That trade went from 55 to about 62 and then it still consolidated.
NEUT18|So technically you would still be in that trade, but now breaking out once again and this time with a stop right around the $60.00 level.
NEUT19|OK, so the way I'm playing this for my accounts is I'm buying it tomorrow at the open stop.
NEUT20|Initial stop is going to be at 60 bucks an then if we get a breakdown below 60.
BEAR21|Trades over I was obviously wrong in my analysis.
BEAR22|Now it's below the 50 day moving average below trendline below the consolidation.
NEUT23|So that's how we're planning, right?
NEUT24|So Avy again, long trade buying it tomorrow at the open.
NEUT25|Currently trading around 6470 and then.
NEUT26|Putting a stop order in right around 60 bucks.
NEUT27|That's it for this.
NEUT28|Trade idea, any questions or comments please leave them below and we'll catch you sometime soon for another one.
NEUT29|"Take care."""
