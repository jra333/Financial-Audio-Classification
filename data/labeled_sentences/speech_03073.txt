NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute because you're new to charts, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|So if you go there I'll explain in detail and also from disclosure standpoint.
NEUT3|I do own Facebook in my retirement accounts from the long side, so just keep that in mind quite the eventful day.
BEAR4|Today an from a presentation standpoint, this is actually a pretty tricky chart to talk about.
NEUT5|'cause there's a lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT6|What do I mean by that?
NEUT7|Well, if you were some sort of day Trader scalper flip or whatever you wanna call yourself and you bought right there, maybe you bought right there.
NEUT8|And your plan was to buy and sell within 20 minutes?
BEAR9|Well then yeah, from that point of view, the charts looking pretty bad.
BULL10|Now if you care about the big picture point of view, sure from these highs there was a pretty big pullback today, but from the grand scheme of it all, the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT11|And as long as higher bases are being built over extended periods of time, that's how long term uptrends are constructed.
NEUT12|I'm going to be talking about things from a bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had more of a day trading type mentality going into it.
NEUT14|And I'm not saying this was going to occur, but just to help.
NEUT15|Explain all this a little bit better, but let's say that the price actually pulls back some more and goes down.
NEUT16|You know one 8950 again, not saying it will happen, but let's say like I said, price goes down to one 8950 so.
NEUT17|Price pulls back, gets down there, but when it does it behave in that manner then starts.
NEUT18|It works way back upwards.
NEUT19|Now emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT20|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT21|Well, you'd have a set of those right there.
NEUT22|You have those lows right there.
NEUT23|You'd have some lows right there.
NEUT24|You'd have even Lowe's down there and then from the big picture, if you envision these stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT25|Well, no sudden you have stair steps still very clearly progressing in the upward direction.
NEUT26|And that's the name of the game.
NEUT27|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL28|It's just going to make progress forward, and in this situation that one.
NEUT29|8950 is that quote unquote progress point once again?
NEUT30|I'm well aware if you are a day trader and you bought there or there, you definitely don't care about these stair steps.
NEUT31|But that's why I try to offer warning.
NEUT32|That I would be coming from the bigger picture point of view.
BULL33|So sure today the price pulled back from its highs.
NEUT34|But think about that word today as in one day looking at multiple days, which is what we're doing here.
BULL35|You can see the price still very clearly has an opportunity to chip away and build overall higher base.
NEUT36|So let's see if the Bulls can get that job done or not.
NEUT37|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT38|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL40|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird.
NEUT42|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT43|But in a cruel way.
BEAR44|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT47|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT48|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.

NEUT50|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
