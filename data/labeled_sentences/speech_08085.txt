BULL0|"""I was thinking that this event is possibly technologically the most significant, since Apple shifted to its own chips in the iPhone and to my eye it didn't disappoint."
NEUT1|The claims that Apple is making about both the battery life and raw performance that you're going to get out of these laptops.
NEUT2|I don't know when's the last time you've seen a jump like this, if ever.
NEUT3|I was trying to think back to when did we have that sort of more most historical Apple laptop announcement.
NEUT4|I think you know for me in my recent history was the MacBook Air.
NEUT5|I just iconically remember Steve Jobs standing up there and pulling out this really thin and light laptop.
NEUT6|Then if you think out of an envelope right?
NEUT7|And if you think back to that, there was a lot of promises there too about the thinnest, lightest, longest lasting laptop ever from Apple, and I think you know for me that was that was sort of yesterday was back kind of moment.
NEUT8|You of course Not's got much excitement on the hardware and these hard that the actual laptops or just refreshed with these new internals, but I think they did that on purpose because you can actually see you neck and neck or put you know apples to apples here.
NEUT9|How much gains you Apple gets by putting in its own chip versus using Intel's chip.
NEUT10|So that's 678 ten hours more battery life, 3 three times the amount of performance increase graphics performance.
NEUT11|So I think then sort of leaving these hardware.
NEUT12|Leaving the hardware as it is right now gives them that ability to really see like look at what we can do.
NEUT13|Look at what one little change in a processor can do.
NEUT14|Yeah, I gotta ask about the impact on the whole PC ecosystem potentially here, because this is a significant providing difference that is being claimed so.
NEUT15|Is it are we going to see Microsoft and Surface having to push more into ARM chips and trying to achieve this kind of performance and battery life benefit?
NEUT16|Yeah, I mean one thing to really bring up is that Tim Cook in one of the last earnings call said the macros has been huge.
NEUT17|But he also said that 50% of the people buying these new Macs are not recurring customers.
NEUT18|They're not people who have previously bought Mac, so that means lots of people are flocking to buy new laptops.
NEUT19|Obviously work from home.
NEUT20|That makes sense, I think.
NEUT21|Here what's really, really compelling is is that they've now made a lot of claims about better performance, better battery life, and of course, more apps than you've been able to get.
NEUT22|On a Microsoft or a Windows computer, they said yesterday 98%.
BULL23|Have better performance than 98% of the Windows PC laptops out there.
NEUT24|Course not really sure which laptops they're talking about now.
NEUT25|Talking about how much faster those are, right?
NEUT26|Like you know, there were a lot of claims Apple made without a lot of numbers to back them up, but when you look at that, you think, OK, you're a new buyer.
NEUT27|You want to buy a laptop?
NEUT28|Look at this, you've got a $999 MacBook Air that's faster, has better battery life than some of these cheaper.
NEUT29|Or some of these similar similarly priced Windows laptops.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT31|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
