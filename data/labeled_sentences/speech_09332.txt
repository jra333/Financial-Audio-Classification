NEUT0|"""Let's go through some of the calls of the day."
NEUT1|If we could gang first, up twice, you Ford downgraded to equal weight Morgan Stanley.
NEUT2|They say their electric vehicle strategy is not clear.
NEUT3|The target remains 9 bucks.
NEUT4|You own shares of letter F. I do and it's been a great run, but let me ask you this, when they do reveal their electric strategy, what's the stock going to do?
NEUT5|Why you ask this gonna go up?
NEUT6|Why don't you call?
NEUT7|You wanna call?
NEUT8|You want to call Morgan Stanley?
NEUT9|But I want to see I want you to see what it feels like to sit on this side of the desk and so look in anybody.
NEUT10|Get twice in touch with Morgan Stanley about their EV strategy.
NEUT11|James Gorman sometimes watching the show.
NEUT12|By the way you heard that Mr Gorman, I'm Steve Weiss, you can address it directly to him.
NEUT13|Yeah, I'll tweet out my phone number.
NEUT14|Look, I'm staying with Ford.
NEUT15|These stocks trade in Unison is very little divergents why?
NEUT16|Because there just aren't that many US based auto auto companies to buy.
BULL17|Four does have an EV strategy when it becomes clear the stock will take another step up, but I did buy.
NEUT18|GM followed my good friend Jim Laventhol into it.
NEUT19|I wish he had mentioned it sooner so I could have gotten in sooner but for to keep going up because it's a cheap stock.
NEUT20|It's very cheap.
NEUT21|So I'm sticking with it.
NEUT22|Yeah, don't mock farmer Jim without farmer Jim, you wouldn't have gotten into General Motors.
NEUT23|The price target, by the way, goes to 53 at the aforementioned Morgan Stanley, the firm that that's done that.
NEUT24|Tell me about that.
NEUT25|Jim's had a great call on this, and I do wish I listened to him sooner and kind of bored bored sooner.
NEUT26|Alright, just one more.
NEUT27|You can stop right there.
NEUT28|We're going to hold this tape forever right?
BULL29|Good compliments from you.
NEUT30|OK few and far between.
NEUT31|We gotta hold this re racket every time 31.
NEUT32|Are thrown around like like manhole covers so I'll give you another one.
NEUT33|Doc looks very good playing King Lear there and is in his throne room but GM will keep going higher.
NEUT34|You know there's just a scarcity value so I think the stocks look well that's why I'm staying with him.
NEUT35|That's why I bought GM.
NEUT36|One works OK. Fisker John adjarian.
NEUT37|Initiated by at City Price Target 26 bucks you own.

NEUT43|That read.
NEUT44|In terms of.
NEUT45|In terms of nicolla.
NEUT46|This happens like.
NEUT47|It's really incredible.
NEUT48|It's really incredible how often Joe that that happens with Johns Mike.
NEUT49|It's at least once per show, fascinating.
NEUT50|Yeah, that's fascinating.
NEUT51|I'll just give you a name, Scott, since Sensata Technologies, which is delivering the electric electrical components into these eaves.
NEUT52|This is a company.
NEUT53|It's a small cap at 7 billion.
NEUT54|I've been in it.
BULL55|Unfortunately, I shook myself out of it a little bit too quickly.
BULL56|Fairly valued, with a forward looking PE.
NEUT57|Somewhere around 30.
BULL58|I think that's a nice compliment to some of the EV trades that have been.
NEUT59|"It's suggested previously the ticker symbol on that is St."""
