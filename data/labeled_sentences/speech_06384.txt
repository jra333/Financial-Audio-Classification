NEUT6|What's up?
NEUT7|Welcome back with that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT8|Let's talk money.
NEUT9|So what is storage?
NEUT10|Storage is an open source cloud storage platform and uses a decentralized network of nodes to host user data.
NEUT11|The platform also secures hosted data using advanced encryption.
NEUT12|This platform was launched in late 2018.
NEUT13|People with hard drive space and a good Internet connection can participate in the network.
NEUT14|They become a unit in the network called the node space.
NEUT15|Providers are rewarded with storage tokens.
NEUT16|Storage currently holds that 103rd largest market cap in the crypto world with a market cap of approximately $686 million.
NEUT17|Currently there are about 253 million coins in circulation with the maximum supply capped at 425 million coins.
NEUT18|As always, remember that I am not a financial advisor, should always be doing your own due diligence.
NEUT19|Let's take a look at the price fluctuation of storage.
NEUT20|If you would have bought storage back in 2019, you likely would have paid under $0.35 per coin for 2020.
BEAR21|The price of storage device a little bit will strain as high as $0.75.
NEUT22|However, it wasn't really until 2021 at storage started to skyrocket on March 28, 2021.
BULL23|Storage set a new all time high of $3.91.
BEAR24|Since then there has been a significant dip at the time of recording storage.
BEAR25|Has been trained at $2.71 so you can see this coin is extremely volatile for the past 24 hours storage is down 10%, but it's actually up 175% for the past week and a 316% in the past 30 days.
BULL26|This is not legal investment advice, but moving forward I expect storage to make our recovery from the recent dip.
NEUT27|If you see this as a long term investment, I think this could be a great opportunity to buy storage at discount from its.
NEUT28|All time high in my opinion, but something you believe in and the fundamentals of a company or corn haven't changed.
NEUT29|There's no need to panic.
NEUT30|Sell as soon as there's a dip.
NEUT31|So where do you invite storage?
NEUT32|Corner coinmarketcap.
NEUT33|The most popular ways to purchase storage tokens or through the following crypto exchanges by ***** Wabi and Coinbase Pro.
NEUT34|I'll remain conservative for my price prediction.
NEUT35|My end of the year prediction is the storage will be trained at $7.00 on the lower end or at $10 on the higher end.
