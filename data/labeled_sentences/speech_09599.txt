NEUT11|Here's the Apple chart daily chart.
NEUT12|Let's take a look here now at some of the recent news.
BEAR13|So right now, if you haven't seen this already coming out November 5th, Apple is facing iPhone 12 chip shortages.
BEAR14|This is a power management chip shortage for its new family of iPhones as they just released that iPhone 12 and some other devices.
NEUT15|This is actually really important because we of course are coming up on the holiday season and when Apple Times their launches.
NEUT16|Many times they see a ton of sales and this is actually really predicated on going into the holiday season and that is when a lot of sales kind of occur.
NEUT17|We see a lot of people getting Christmas gifts.
BEAR18|We see holiday gifts, things like that, and this would not be the time to see an issue like this, although it's unclear how much is actually going to hurt Apple.
NEUT19|It is something to be aware of.
NEUT20|So now coming back here to the chart.
NEUT21|What we could do is we can draw in some trendlines like we'd like to do, but we're going to do.
NEUT22|First is let's draw a downtrend.
NEUT23|So let's take a look at this high and let's hit some of these loads.
NEUT24|So right now, what we're seeing is we're seeing.
BEAR25|Apple is right at the cusp of this downtrend if it was to respect this downturn on the daily chart, each of these camels is one day.
BULL26|This would be we're on the cusp of breaking out, so it's very interesting to see what happens over the next couple of days, but as of right now we also are looking at these highs right here around that 1:25 if Apple starts making a move up the next level of resistance will most likely be that 125 level, and if we can break above that, it looks like we should be looking good as long as we bring over one 25130 we should be able to test.
BULL27|And hit all time highs by the end of the year at the current pace we're on.
BULL28|As long as momentum continues to the upside, another good thing to note here is that we're putting in some higher lows to a base on the chart.
NEUT29|We see a 103 and then we come back here and we see a 107.
BEAR30|So we're putting in higher lows.
BEAR31|If Apple was to dip down, wouldn't want to see it drop too much below 110.
BEAR32|If it does drop below 10, which puts us right here, well, we can see if we can hold up around this 107 if we can't hold that maybe 103 and then if we cannot hold that it looks like around $100.
BULL33|Maybe another area of potential support based on this gap right here.
BULL34|Now, of course, ultimately we believe Apple is a solid long term investment, so to be super concerned with these drops to the downside, it would be a great buying opportunity.
NEUT35|Of course it will depend on the current news in the current landscape that's driving it, but ultimately the way you're going to hurt yourself with playing Apple is if you start getting cute and you start playing with calls, you start playing with put options and things like that.
BULL36|Now, yes, you can make a tremendously higher percentage return on your options and much shorter periods of time.
NEUT37|And if you're someone who's day trading it.
NEUT38|It may be worth playing these day.
NEUT39|Trade these breakouts over these resistance levels over these kind of areas.
BULL40|That could be great for resistance breakout and great for some day trading calls.
NEUT41|But ultimately if you're gonna be buying shares of Apple, look to buy the dips.
BULL42|Look to dollar cost average because Apple will probably be making all time highs again very very soon, so hopefully this was helpful.
