NEUT0|"""Well, you may have missed it with Black Friday in the Holidays, but an interesting report from the Wall Street Journal on Friday saying that General Motors is interested in applying for a banking charter."
NEUT1|Yet again, this time with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
NEUT2|In addition to Utah's banking regulator.
NEUT3|Now this is all coming on the heels of developments in the regulatory space people in Washington DC have been hot and cold on the idea of non banks having banking services.
NEUT4|So in the case of GM this would be for example, being able to open up a deposit account with the.

BULL6|They've gotten bank charter and needed a bailout.

NEUT8|This time around they are hoping to start an industrial loan charger to again start taking deposits to finance a lot of the auto loans that they originate for their types of products.
NEUT9|Now, for what it's worth, the what they call industrial loan charger is a structure that already exists and a number of other companies think of.
NEUT10|Toyota, BMW, Harley-Davidson.
NEUT11|Even John Deere have financing arms, but again there's been this patchwork in DC of companies that have been able to get one.
NEUT12|Win regulators happen cool with it, but then other companies that haven't been cool with it and don't have one so GM now hoping to take advantage of the Trump administration.
BULL13|Led FDIC, at least maybe before the bind administration takes place to take advantage of the opportunity to again re open a banking arm in their company again, a repeat of 2008.
NEUT14|"Interesting to see how all of this unfolds question."""
