NEUT0|"""There's a lot of moving parts have been used."
NEUT1|The question is what's driving?
NEUT2|And this back up in yields that we've seen has been a move, not an inflation compensation.
NEUT3|It's been a moving real yields, which is imparted growth signal, and I think it's in part about the Fed unwinding its balance sheet.
NEUT4|And yeah, you know, if you look at the equity market, the equity market is in a sense, you know, the multiple is in a sense like a bond yield just turned upside down, so.
NEUT5|As these yields go higher, it provides a challenge and the equity markets barely had a challenge.
BEAR6|We had one blip early in the year on the unwinding of those volatility funds, and this is is likely another mini correction.
NEUT7|What's the downside from here?
NEUT8|Why I don't know where?
NEUT9|We're nowhere near recession, if you think.
BEAR10|Recession as an event is nowhere in the numbers.
NEUT11|And recession events and only 20% drop, you know these days 5% makes correction, but I'm not here.
NEUT12|I don't as an economist.
NEUT13|I can't look in increments of three to five days.
NEUT14|An economist.
NEUT15|I can look in increments of maybe three to five, but you can look.
NEUT16|You look at the words that Jay Powell used last week with a with a.
BEAR17|Was that a mistake?
NEUT18|No, no.
NEUT19|He's been a Master of communication compared to.
NEUT20|Point people have been lauding him feadship until until they weren't.
NEUT21|The trouble here, right?
BEAR22|The trouble with with with saying he made a mistake there, which I probably shouldn't have said it.
NEUT23|But look nobody who follows.
NEUT24|the Fed didn't hear those remarks on its two negatives, but basically people who follow the Fed heard those markets.
NEUT25|It.
NEUT26|OK, what he's saying is you're going to a rate hike or two above neutral three and a quarter 3 1/2, which is directly in the forecast already.
NEUT27|I don't think anybody heard those remarks and thought Powell is going to four.
BEAR28|Powell is going to 5 powers out of his mind.
NEUT29|Those remarks and I thought I'm not really sure where they're going.
NEUT30|No, but but you have to do it in context.
NEUT31|Becky of what the Fed is said, still appreciate.
NEUT32|I think he was.
NEUT33|It was in a forum where he was in an interview.
NEUT34|He would.
NEUT35|Never said those things if he had been writing out his speech or what he planned to say and given remarks, I think we spoke a little off the cuff, and I think there are a lot of ways you can interpret it.
NEUT36|If you want to interpret it that way, you can, but you have to ignore a lot of other evidence to make that look.
NEUT37|I think what he was saying was this.
NEUT38|They took the word accommodative out of the less fair statement, and he was just re qualifying when they said they took it out, because they could take it out, and the numbers they said, look, we're not at neutral yet.
NEUT39|You know, maybe it might have been better if it were not a neutral yet.
BULL40|But the feds plotted out it expects to see interest rates go if things unfold to a little shy of 3 1/2%.
NEUT41|I'm moving very gradually and you know I think that's right because although inflations content, it's in content because the Fed has been adjusting rates higher, the feds not neutral.
NEUT42|So just tell us there's more rate hikes to come.
NEUT43|the Fed is a rate hike in December.
NEUT44|In its forecast, it has three rate hikes next year.
NEUT45|My guess is actually the inflation numbers will push the Fed to four, but none of that's a disaster.
NEUT46|As long as companies generating profits and the best piece of news that.
NEUT47|We had was a cutting corporate tax rates, which is massively expanded.
BEAR48|Profit margins on the equity market suggested that we can't keep adjusting to that positive shock for effort.
NEUT49|"Sometimes it has to settle down."""
