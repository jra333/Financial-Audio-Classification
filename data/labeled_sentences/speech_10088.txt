BEAR0|"""I want to get to some breaking news though regarding the International Monetary Fund which released its economic outlook this morning and the IMF says that we are in for the worst recession since the Great Depression."
BULL1|For more on this, I want to bring in our Fed correspondent Brian Shawn Good Morning, Brian Good Morning, Alexis, yeah, the International Monetary Fund just releasing its biannual World Economic Outlook report where it says that global growth is expected to contract actually by 3% in the year 2020.
BEAR2|That's a remarkable downgrade from its last projection that it provided.
BULL3|In January, where it said it expected 3.3% positive growth.
NEUT4|So again now revising that to negative 3% in light of the COVID-19 at the time of its last release in January.
NEUT5|That was before the coronavirus really took full form.
BEAR6|When you look at a number of pockets around the world, they do have pretty gloomy prospects for growth and a lot of quarters of the country with the euro area projected to contract by 7.5% in 2020.
BULL7|Mexico contracting by 6.6%.
BULL8|the United Kingdom contracting 6.5% and then the United States contracting by 5.
BEAR9|5% they also downgraded China, saying that it will only grow by 1.2% and if that sounds OK because it's at least still positive, keep in mind that's a pretty remarkable downgrade from its previous projection for 2019.
BULL10|Growth of six point 1%.
NEUT11|So the International Monetary Fund really saying that this great lockdown is that's how they acquainted is going to have a pretty sharp effect on the global economy urging really local state governments and also central banks to really step in and provide the fiscal and monetary support.
NEUT12|To keep the global economy chugging along as it tries to get through the health implications of the COVID-19 Lexus you mentioned, central banks, Brian.
NEUT13|What did the IMF say, if anything, about the actions the Federal Reserve has taken thus far?
NEUT14|Yeah, well, the Federal Reserve, being the largest central bank in the world.
NEUT15|Obviously in view as the COVID-19 really took grip, especially in the United States in March.
BULL16|Now what the IMF said was that it was encouraged by the number of liquidity facilities.
NEUT17|Keep in mind before reserve has opened up nine of those liquidity facilities addressing everything from overnight repo to U.S. Treasury markets too.
NEUT18|Commercial mortgage backed securities and even things as specific as fallen Angel junk debt.
NEUT19|So the IMF said that it is encouraged by the Fed's efforts to make sure that there's no contagion in financial markets that might spill over as a result of any of those individual markets popping.
NEUT20|They said, the one thing that the Federal Reserve did that was actually the most helpful is really providing those U.S. dollar swap lines to 14 central banks and also offering a U.S. dollar repo facilities out of its New York branch.
NEUT21|That being announced a few weeks ago, they said that providing you a solid liquid is.
NEUT22|Fantastic way really to stop any sort of contagion that can result from an International Crisis involving a crunch on trying to find greenbacks.
NEUT23|Brian before we let you go.
BULL24|They did talk about a possible rebound looking out to 2021, right?
BULL25|That's right, so they did say that despite the pretty sharp number for 2020 that they do expect a rebound of five point 8% for the global economy in 2021.
BULL26|They said the US could actually jump back again from a contraction of 5.9% in 2022.
BULL27|Growth of four point 7%.
