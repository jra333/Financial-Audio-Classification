NEUT0|"""Is it a V?"
NEUT1|Is it a U?
NEUT2|Maybe it's an L. War, perhaps it's easy, or it may be insane.
NEUT3|W or.
NEUT4|And Nike stocks wish we keep hearing people to argue about the shape of the recovery.
NEUT5|But this whole debate.
NEUT6|Misses the point.
NEUT7|The defining question of this market is very simple.
NEUT8|Well, we have a depression.
NEUT9|Anything that makes it depression less likely causes stocks to explode higher and that's what yesterday's rally was really about.
BULL10|Even as we gave up some of those gains today, I'm calling this a consolidation day no matter what.
BEAR11|Now sinking 391 points as to be losing 1.05%, NASDAQ tipping .54% when you have a big rally yesterday and it doesn't give up everything, just 'cause there's a late afternoon sell off.
NEUT12|It's a consolidation.
NEUT13|The issue here is not whether we will have a rapid V or recovery slow U.
NEUT14|We pass along the body, get the WAL shape.
NEUT15|I mean we I don't know the L of course is the House of Payne Frejus.
NEUT16|Lately the Congress any have started talking about this, which no doubt because of the Michael Jordan series right?
BEAR17|And the recovery starts out strong but then slows down traumatically all these people fretting about the shape of the recovery or getting ahead of themselves.
NEUT18|Forget the recovery.
NEUT19|We know the shape of decline as in will it be a really bad recession or a full blown depression?
NEUT20|That's what's on the table until last week that depression scenario was very much.
NEUT21|The only thing on the table if not in my mind, the very likely scenario even after the Fed the Treasury Department moved aggressively and I think terrifically to cushion the economy.
BEAR22|There was still real possibility that we were headed for Breadlines, an massive homeless encampments.
NEUT23|Major cities.
NEUT24|I've got a food line right near me in Brooklyn.
NEUT25|It stretches for as far as the eye can see.
NEUT26|Yes, why you wouldn't wouldn't know it all from the average.
NEUT27|Is there is a real chance of the Great Depression Producs look whatever's happening here.
NEUT28|It's entirely possible that the economy.
NEUT29|Hasn't yet bottomed.
BEAR30|I think we probably have, but it's not going to shock me if we have 1,000,000 more layoffs and I could certainly see the stock market going lower.
NEUT31|These levels.
NEUT32|I got a question.
