NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol PEIX."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly one.
NEUT8|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT9|Could say up here above $6.75.
BEAR10|I don't get me wrong, the price falls below 675.
NEUT11|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL12|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture POV.
NEUT14|Battles with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very beneficial because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there have been defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|Having us visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yeah, stand up 675 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price.
NEUT21|Is above that purple line?
NEUT22|The bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|First key level is just simply where the party in momentum stop today and that was up there at 7:40.
NEUT24|But if 740 can be broken.
NEUT25|Next to me that pink line up there, which on my chart to know it's a very well known the very famous 200.
NEUT26|Moving average and the value of that right now is will just call at $8.10.
NEUT27|So keep an eye on that.
NEUT28|But overall these are going to be the main levels moving forward into Friday.
NEUT29|But anyway, look at it.
BULL30|Great volume, very nice price movement.
NEUT31|Let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT32|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live.
NEUT34|Revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
