BULL0|"""We've seen 2 record breaking days now of trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange."
BULL1|The Hang Seng index has risen to its highest level since January 2008, but turnovers been the real eye catcher today.
NEUT2|$37 billion of shares were traded.
BULL3|That's four times the average we saw through last year.
NEUT4|There are two factors at play here.
NEUT5|One is that Hong Kong listed shares are simply much cheaper than those in Shanghai.
BULL6|That's drawn a lot of interest from Mainland based investors.
NEUT7|The second thing is that the Chinese government recently allowed mutual funds to access these stock connector cross border trading scheme, so some investors are looking to get in ahead of expected buying from them.
NEUT8|The question on everybody's lips is whether this is the start of the long awaited Bull Run in Hong Kong or simply a temporary phenomenon driven by liquidity.
NEUT9|The answer will only become clear once the price gap between Shanghai and Hong Kong has disappeared.
