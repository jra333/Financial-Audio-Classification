NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol BIDU."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be if the price could say up here above $180.00.
NEUT8|Now.
NEUT9|Don't get me wrong, if the price drops below 180.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL11|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there were being defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|Having much visualize that that is what has been represented again.
NEUT19|Yes and above 180 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100%.
NEUT20|On the chart, as far as levels of resistance are concerned, they just don't matter what do I mean by that?
NEUT21|What matters the most is what the price is already been doing.
BEAR22|And that is this right here just chipping away and Bill is building these higher lows.
NEUT23|Or if you wanted those stair steps.
NEUT24|So in other words, as long as the price continues to build these stair steps in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT25|So focus on healthy consolidations, focus on building those higher bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
