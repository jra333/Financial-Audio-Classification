BULL0|"""Hey everyone, it's Robbie here."
NEUT1|I am an investor giving you the market updates and sharing my stock market picks.
NEUT2|This is for educational purposes only and not financial advice in any way.
NEUT3|We're going to analyze penny stocks, growth stocks and dividend stocks.
NEUT4|Here let's begin.
BEAR5|So I believe the dip in Peloton could be a buying opportunity and you shouldn't pass on it.
BEAR6|So Peloton stock is down 28% to start the year 38% from its high this year, and there's.
NEUT7|But there's lots of potential here.
NEUT8|Remote working, remote education, even remote happy hours, are the trends.
NEUT9|Because of the pandemic, and to that end.
NEUT10|Remote gym workouts where peloton stock is a standout performer is one of them.
BULL11|Now, Peloton is coming off a strong fiscal Q2 earnings report that should begin pushing the stock price.
BEAR12|Higher peloton stock is currently down 28% as we mentioned here to date, which means that it could be an attractive price for long term investors.
BEAR13|On top of that, pallet on current recently won a court ruling that was brought on by competitor who was trying to keep the company's popular bike plus exercise system out of the US market on February 22nd.
BEAR14|A federal judge rejected her request for Icon Health and Fitness, the maker of NordicTrack exercise bikes that sought to keep the peloton bike, plus line from being sold in the US with its auto follow feature.
NEUT15|Now those are some great tailwinds right now, and let's work up a sweat to take a closer look at Peloton Peloton has been around since 2012 when it started because of a Kickstarter campaign.
NEUT16|The fitness company is known for its high end home gym equipment, including its exercise bikes, its bike accessories, as well as its weights.
BULL17|The company integrates web based technology to its home workouts to remain on the cutting edge of home.
BULL18|Systems, now Pelton, has a popular exercise app and it's produced workout videos that you can live stream through the company's products and it didn't go public until 2019 in September, when it was trading at about $19.00 per share, and while the public offering has had a slow start, the stock is now a huge winner.
NEUT19|If you got in because paultons up to about 105 to $106.00 earnings released in early February also showed that the second quarter Peloton had a healthy track record, right revenue came in at one point.
BEAR20|06 billion versus the analysts expectations of $1.03 billion.
BULL21|Peloton also announced that quarterly sales were up 128% and they increase their outlook for the full year 2021.
BULL22|They think that sales are going top $4 billion, which previously, they forecasted $3.9 billion.
BULL23|Now, the company said it plans to invest more than 100,000,000 in air freight to help speed up deliveries to customers, and it's already done a $420 million deal to acquire Precourt, which is an exercise equipment manufacturer, which is also expected to help along the lines of the high demand.
NEUT24|That peloton says that investors should be expect slow but steady growth, and that's what we want to hear.
NEUT25|I mean, we'd like faster growth, but they're setting their expectations and pellet on another home.
NEUT26|Fitness companies are taking advantage of the stay at home trends.
NEUT27|In hindsight, it's IPO couldn't have been better timed.
NEUT28|I'm buying on this dip because this is going to be my long term hold.
NEUT29|I believe with all the new products Palatine is coming out with its making their service more sticky and this is not financial advice.
BULL30|I think the work from home trend is going to continue.
NEUT31|We're not going to go full time back to the office.
NEUT32|We're going to do two or three days work from home and we need a home equipment to workout.
