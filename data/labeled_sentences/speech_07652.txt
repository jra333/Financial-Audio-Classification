NEUT1|It starts at 9:45 AM.
NEUT2|Yahoo Finance is the exclusive online host for the event and joining us now from Omaha, NE is Julia LaRoche is there for the meeting with the latest Tell us a little bit about the scene there running up to the meeting.
BULL3|Hey there Julia.
NEUT4|That's right, I'm inside the exhibition Hall and as you can see I am at the Coca Cola exhibit and all around me are the various portfolio companies.
NEUT5|This will open up at 12 noon local time to the shareholders to do a lot of shopping before the annual meeting, which as you mentioned kicks off tomorrow morning live on Yahoo Finance.
BULL6|There's already a lot of buzz News coming out from here in Omaha, NE apiece.
NEUT7|Of that news.
NEUT8|Is Warren Buffett confirming to CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway has been buying shares of?
NEUT9|Amazon now our very own Andy Serwer, sat down with Buffett recently and he asked him specifically.
NEUT10|Hey, why haven't you invested in Amazon?
NEUT11|You've been a longtime fan of Jeff Bezos.
NEUT12|Let's take a listen to why he didn't until now.
NEUT13|You mentioned Amazon as a game changer and I have to ask you, you haven't bought the stock here and admirer of Jeff Bezos.
NEUT14|The listing of the richest people in America came out.
NEUT15|He's number one.
NEUT16|I think your friend Bill Gates is number 2, your number 3 so you can see what he's done in myriad ways.
NEUT17|And of course, the question is how come you haven't bought Amazon?
NEUT18|Is there still time to buy?
NEUT19|Would you still buy it?
NEUT20|I always admired Jeff.
NEUT21|I mean, I met him 20 years ago or so and and.
NEUT22|I thought it was something special, but I didn't realize you could go from books to it.
NEUT23|What's happened there?
NEUT24|I mean, he had a vision and executed in an incredible way, something that would not have, you know.
NEUT25|But there's a lot of games I miss I would have missed.
NEUT26|You know, I would have missed Microsoft even if I got to know Bill early or something.
NEUT27|Those just aren't my games.
NEUT28|I don't worry about the things that I miss that are outside my circle of competence of evaluating.
NEUT29|I do.
BEAR30|I have missed things who are within my circle.
BEAR31|And that's a terrible mistake.
BEAR32|Those are my biggest mistakes.
NEUT33|You haven't seen him and but I don't.
NEUT34|It's not a mistake 'cause I miss Netscape or something like that at all there.
NEUT35|I would say that maybe 5% of the companies or 10% of the companies that most are within an area.
NEUT36|My circle of competence.
NEUT37|There's something I should be able to understand.
NEUT38|Now, it's not necessarily Buffett making the investment on Amazon.
NEUT39|Remember, he has two young investment deputies, so you have Ted Weschler and Todd Combs each managed 13 billion apiece, and they have total discretion over the stock investments in that massive $173 billion equity portfolio.
NEUT40|So it's likely maybe both.
NEUT41|Maybe one of them made the investment here when it comes to Amazon.
NEUT42|I really like what Buffett said when he talks about mistakes he's going to do about 6 hours of Q&A tomorrow, and he often.
NEUT43|Talks about the mistakes he's made in the past and when you think about Buffett, yes, he's the most legendary investor of our generation.
NEUT44|But he likes to think of himself as a teacher.
NEUT45|There are a lot of lessons to be learned here.
NEUT46|Julie, yeah, six hours.
NEUT47|That is quite a marathon, especially for an 88 year old man.
NEUT48|Julia looking forward to our coverage of that.
BULL49|"Thank you."""
