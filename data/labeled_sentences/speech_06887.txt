NEUT0|"""Kate you I think thought that maybe the value trade was getting a little long in the tooth and now you need to be more selective."
NEUT1|Does that mean you just heard Phil's report?
NEUT2|Does that mean something like Tesla or back to growth?
NEUT3|Given what we're seeing with the economy picking up steam?
NEUT4|I do, I do think that's what it means.
NEUT5|I think you have to focus on quality.
BEAR6|Look if the stocks go down 50% like some of the energy stocks did.
NEUT7|The REITs, the financials.
BULL8|It's very easy for them to bounce back up, so you've had a big move in energy.
NEUT9|You've had a big move in materials.
BULL10|You've had a big move in small cap, small cap, value up 115% on a year to year basis.
NEUT11|The easy money has been made, I think now you have to really be a little discrimina Tori.
NEUT12|That's what I think.
NEUT13|And want to shift gears totally with Darrell because Darryl you you look at at the 10 year and you look at previous action in yields when an economy starts percolating and opening up.
NEUT14|And in the past we've seen more of a move based on inflation expectations in the 10 year.
BEAR15|It's been very muted.
NEUT16|So you think something's gotta give one way or the other.
NEUT17|Yeah I do.
NEUT18|Joe, I think you better have.
BULL19|Real rates go higher.
BEAR20|I mean were negative 63 basis points on the 10 year investors should not stand for that type of negative real yield in today's environment.
BULL21|Last time the yield curve bear steepen like this rates went up 130 basis points on the real yields.
BULL22|So far they've only gone up 50 basis points.
BULL23|I wouldn't be surprised to see real rates get back to 0.
NEUT24|Which would mean somewhere around a 232 forty tenure.
NEUT25|Wow, now would that put a damper?
NEUT26|If that does not happen, or even if it does happen, does that make you less bullish on equities?
NEUT27|No, quite the opposite, 'cause I think the yield curve is both, or bear steepening for the right reason.
NEUT28|You got, you know, a uniquely bullish macro backdrop.
NEUT29|You got strong commodity prices.
BEAR30|You got strong global equity tape got tighten credit spreads got falling equity and bond market volatility.
BEAR31|The negative real yields even absolute yields at 2:30 to 40.
NEUT32|Don't put that much headwind in equity earnings, and you've got this huge fiscal push behind you.
NEUT33|That's going to give you a trillion dollars of spending from the March package.
NEUT34|The 1.9 trillion over the next five months.
NEUT35|Think about that five months.
NEUT36|You're going to get a trillion dollars.
NEUT37|From that, just that March package injected into the economy.
BULL38|That's going to give us a push like we haven't seen in a long time.
NEUT39|I've only got like 10 seconds, so you just want to wrap things up, but can you do it in that much time?
NEUT40|Be selective, stay long.
NEUT41|Be selective, stay long, stay with quality if you've made money in energy, you made money and some of these value names don't overstay your welcome.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
