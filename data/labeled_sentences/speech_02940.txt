NEUT0|"""The countdown is on to tomorrow morning and Facebook and one of the biggest public stock offerings in history."
NEUT1|They're calling it Mardi Gras on Wall Street.
NEUT2|But can the small investor really make a fortune?
NEUT3|ABC Sharon Alphonsi outside NASDAQ right now, Sheriff.
NEUT4|Well tonight we know the opening price of one of the most coveted stocks in years is going to be $38.00 and to give you a little perspective, that means tomorrow night at this time Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is going to be worth 7 times more than Oprah and 40 times more than Queen Elizabeth.
NEUT5|He's a regular looking guy in a hoodie, but by tomorrow at this time Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg could be worth a way beyond regular $20 billion.
NEUT6|Millions of Facebook users are hoping to share in the windfall people like Jerome Cleary who's never bought a stock in his life.
NEUT7|I've read things that say you should invest in companies you like or know, and I know this company very well, but he'll have to wait some 90% of the shares will be available only to the mega wealthy, even the 10%.
BEAR8|Sold through discount brokers will be tough to get.
NEUT9|Ameritrade is requiring customers have $250,000 in their accounts, Fidelity 500,000.
NEUT10|The rest of us will get a chance to buy it later in the day as those lucky first buyers turn around and sell for a profit.
BULL11|Some analysts think that $38.00 opening price could double or even triple in hours.
NEUT12|So should we buy in?
NEUT13|There's no way I'd buy Facebook tomorrow if I'm an individual investor first of all.
NEUT14|The institutions have gotten there first, and we're getting their sloppy seconds.
NEUT15|There are big questions about how Facebook will turn its huge membership into huge profits.
NEUT16|One of the biggest advertisers.
BEAR17|GM just pulled all its add $10 million worth saying the ads just don't work, but that hasn't dampened the Facebook frenzy with buyers.
NEUT18|Hoping this stock is the next Apple.
NEUT19|If you bought just 10 shares of it on opening day, your $220 would now be worth more than $44,000.
NEUT20|10 Shares of Amazon worth more than $27,000 today.
NEUT21|And if your grandmother picked up 10 shares of Johnson and Johnson back in the day, it would be worth more than $10 million today.
NEUT22|So what do you do the night before you become a millionaire or one case a billionaire?
BULL23|Well, Facebook, they're going to be working.
NEUT24|And Diane, I know you've been to one of these events before.
NEUT25|It's one of the 24 hour hackathons they called us basically an all night creative session where they stay off working on new ideas.
NEUT26|That's where they came up with the idea for that like button, so that's what they plan to do.
NEUT27|They're going to keep working through the night until the morning when Mark Zuckerberg rings the opening Bell.
NEUT28|Facebook frenzy begins.
NEUT29|Alright, that was me hiding behind the hackathon T shirt.
NEUT30|I remember a lot of beer that was then there, going to be a lot more Kings tonight.
BULL31|"Thank you, Sharon alphonsi."""
