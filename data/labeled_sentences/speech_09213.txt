NEUT0|"""How do you determine whether markets have already priced in the hope of the future and perhaps the pain of the now starts to eat into that meaning?"
BEAR1|It might be overheating.
NEUT2|Yeah, you know, I don't.
NEUT3|I don't think it's priced in yard.
NEUT4|I mean I, you know been on this show for a number of months talking about, you know people talk about PE ratio.
BULL5|So gosh, markets are higher.
BEAR6|The equity markets too high.
NEUT7|But I think what you think about this number and think what does it mean?
NEUT8|More stimulus coming?
NEUT9|I think about what what just happened last year.
NEUT10|If you include the deficit yet over three trillion of stimulus that came in, so we almost 15% of GDP.
NEUT11|And now we're going to get what could be another couple of trillion that's coming in.
NEUT12|So think about the growth paradigm you could have over a 6% GDP.
BULL13|I think you could get a 7% GDP next year.
NEUT14|So now think about valuations.
NEUT15|The equity market multiples are high, but if you take earnings acceleration and you take earnings yield, So what is the Fed going to do now?
NEUT16|Feds gotta stay on hold.
NEUT17|Rates are going to stay down.
BEAR18|The earnings yield of the equity market is literally.
NEUT19|If you take 2021, anticipated earnings is 5% ish free.
BEAR20|Cash flow yield is 5% ish with Treasurys at zero.
BULL21|"You know, I think I think you've got markets have priced it in somewhat, but there's more to go."""
