NEUT0|"""Fools retirement investors love in common."
NEUT1|The best way to get income in this current low interest rate environment for many investors has been to pick dividend paying stocks.
BEAR2|But a number of retirement investors make a big mistake when it comes to dividend stocks that could actually cost them money in the long run.
NEUT3|My name is Dan Caplinger, I'm the Motley Fool's director of investment planning, and today I want to talk about this dividend investing mistake that so many people make and basically what it amounts to is choosing.
NEUT4|High yielding stocks without thinking about why those yields are high, or whether those yields are sustainable.
NEUT5|Now, it makes sense that retirees are really stretching to get every dollar income from their investments.
NEUT6|They possibly can.
NEUT7|In the past you could rely on things like bank CD's and savings accounts to give you solid returns of 3/4.
BULL8|Even 5% on a completely safe basis in retirees got used to being able to access that level of income, but.
NEUT9|Now that interest rates are much lower, the CD is often paying 1% or less.
BEAR10|It's forced retirement investors in who are already retired to look at alternatives that will pay those kinds of yields.
NEUT11|And unfortunately, in today's environment you generally have to go to the upper end of the high yield dividend stock realm in order to match those kinds of returns.
NEUT12|Now the question you always have to ask with dividend stock is where is the money coming from to pay the dividend.
NEUT13|They are those profits sustainable in so many cases, the answer is no.
NEUT14|There's a litany of stocks if formerly paid high dividends that have failed to hold up in the long run now, and in addition we also have to look at why those yields are high, for instance with utility stocks.
BEAR15|Right now they've been soaring through the roof because interest rates in the market have been falling, and utility stocks tend to move in the opposite direction as prevailing interest rates.
NEUT16|So if interest rates.
NEUT17|Start rising, which many expect them to do.
BEAR18|Utilities could come under pressure and you could suffer capital losses even as you reap those dividend payments, but not all high yielding dividend stocks are bad.
NEUT19|Take a look at the track record that a company has been paying higher dividends overtime.
BULL20|For instance telecom giant AT&T pays over a 5% yield, but it's also had a good track record of raising those dividends.
BULL21|Overtime has substantial cash flow coming in from its network of both landline.
NEUT22|And wireless network revenue when so there's probably not a threat to the dividend in the near term.
BULL23|Similarly, cigarette giant Altria group his decades long history of paying higher dividends to their investors even though the tobacco industry has been falling on tough times lately, all trays still found ways to stay profitable and to keep moving forward.
NEUT24|So be smart about the dividend stocks that you pick, don't necessarily reach for the highest yields you can find.
NEUT25|Look more for dividend.
BULL26|Growth and that will serve you better in the future.
