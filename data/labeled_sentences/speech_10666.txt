NEUT0|"""Everyone, let's take back the Apple stock we can see here today."
NEUT1|It has formed a red candle, but even though.
BULL2|This is a small candle, but we are well above the first year.
BULL3|My line that means we already go back up in short term and also is still likely to form a.
BEAR4|Short term short term bottom here, but one thing we need to pay attention to that is we are still well below these two young men last 20 days and.
NEUT5|50 days till may.
BEAR6|So unless we break out from these two line, there's still possibility for it to go down.
NEUT7|So should be cautious here.
NEUT8|As to the volume is still too low, so let's wait and see what will happen.
NEUT9|So for this low volume, bounce back sometimes it's not reliable.
BULL10|"Thank you."""
