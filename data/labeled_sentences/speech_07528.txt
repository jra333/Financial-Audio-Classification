BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This weird video chart on ticker symbol VISL.
NEUT2|We will tell take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT4|By 30 minute.
NEUT5|I do offer an explanation video at that link, so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
BULL6|Very nice movement today, not only from the price action POV, but you look down here at the volume end well above average volume on the day.
NEUT7|So let eyeballs on this one going into the weekend.
NEUT8|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT9|So the first level of support that stands out to me and what I would call the ideal level is right here at $0.32.
NEUT10|Ideal mean if So what makes this chart look the absolute strongest?
NEUT11|Definitely, if the price can stay above 32 now, don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that level.
NEUT12|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have to price couldn't manage to actually step above that level.
BULL13|That would definitely be a massive sign of power going forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT18|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT19|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT20|That right there I'm defining as the move.
NEUT21|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT22|As long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT23|As a line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control her and visualize that.
NEUT24|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT25|Yeah, staying above 32 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bulls are in full control of the chart.
NEUT26|What about levels of resistance moving forward?
NEUT27|In terms of the sellers are at main area of resistance going into next week and we're right up there at $0.35.
NEUT28|Nothing fancy or complicated behind that other than the fact of that just simply where the price got rejected from today.
NEUT29|So keep an eye on that.
BULL30|If the price can actually get up above that level.
NEUT31|The next key area.
NEUT32|Unless you actually just go to the daily time frame, this is a good problem to have, so I don't have to squeeze down the chart that much.
NEUT33|So there we go.
NEUT34|So now we're on the daily timeframe, but if the price can break above that area of resistance right now at 35, next key level to focus on would then be up there right around the 40 cent mark.
NEUT35|So 3540 next couple of key battlegrounds going forward.
BULL36|But All in all, definitely a great movement.
NEUT37|Great way to end the week, so let's see how this one plays out next week.
NEUT38|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT39|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT40|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL41|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT42|The first key is super weird.
NEUT43|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT44|But in a cruel way.
BEAR45|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT46|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT47|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT48|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT49|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
