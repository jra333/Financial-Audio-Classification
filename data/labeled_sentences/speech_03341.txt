NEUT0|"""Welcome back Forbes magazine."
NEUT1|Ranking the most powerful public companies in its annual Global 2000 list.
NEUT2|Coming in first place this year, get this the industrial and Commercial Bank of China, followed by China Construction Bank, then Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT3|Then JP Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo want to bring in the deputy editor of Investing in Forbes Media.
BULL4|Hollett Toryal a hella good to see it.
BULL5|Thanks so much for joining us of course thanks.
NEUT6|So go through the system.
NEUT7|How do you rank these companies?
NEUT8|Absolutely so we take a large group of companies.
NEUT9|We look at them.
NEUT10|For metrics we've got sales look at profits, look at assets and will get market value.
NEUT11|We assign the score to each one and then we take a composite and rank those composites so you end up with our 2000.
NEUT12|It's incredible that Chinese companies are the first two.
NEUT13|Absolutely.
BULL14|It's been pretty consistent in China.
NEUT15|In the US, dominate the top ten and overall just a list.
NEUT16|I think it's pretty reflective of what is going on in the economy.
NEUT17|To them contribute something like 30% of the world's GDP, so it's pretty natural that they'll end up dominating the list.
NEUT18|That makes sense.
NEUT19|Are there any forward looking metrics taken into consideration?
NEUT20|Or is this all backward?
NEUT21|One, is it?
NEUT22|As of the end of right?
NEUT23|So we look at trailing 12 months.
NEUT24|The end beginning of April.
NEUT25|OK, the last 12 months.
BULL26|OK, 'cause it's interesting to see all those banks on the list when they had a great run since the election last year, but this year they haven't done so well.
NEUT27|So right.
BEAR28|You also see that on oil and gas, oil and gas companies on this year's list sell Exxon fell out of the top ten, and I think you might see an increase maybe next year, depending what happens with oil production.
NEUT29|You know how?
NEUT30|How much change, I'm just dynamism.
NEUT31|Is there to the list?
NEUT32|Because, you know, if we look historically, for instance, I believe at one point just on public market valuation.
NEUT33|Japan had, I think, nine of the ten largest companies in the world in the 1980s, which I don't think is 1 even near the top of the list now.
NEUT34|So how much churn is there?
NEUT35|How much dynamism to the IT depends year to year?
NEUT36|So, for instance, is here.
BEAR37|You'll see a lot of retail fall off.
NEUT38|I mean, Ralph Lauren's no longer on the list.
BEAR39|Chipotle's gone for obvious reasons.
NEUT40|So there's also mergers and acquisitions that take place.
NEUT41|It's a B. Miller is no longer because of the ABN Bev acquisition.
NEUT42|You also have Starwood, which was a big one, has been acquired by Marriott, and now Marriott sort of ranked up.
NEUT43|So in terms of just changes, it really depends.
NEUT44|One of two things, either acquisitions or this kind of fallen off.
NEUT45|Based on our metrics, what about big changes?
NEUT46|Companies that made huge leaps on the list?
NEUT47|Amazon?
NEUT48|I mean, that is a big one, right?
BULL49|For obvious reasons, sure mean profits have soared, market value has soared, they've gone into the top 100 very easily.
BEAR50|And on the flip side, a lot of other retailers have either fallen off Nordstrom and Target have just kind of ended up in the bottom half of the list.
NEUT51|But Amazon is a big reason you can see them moving up.
NEUT52|What about tech?
NEUT53|So Amazon is kind of a hybrid of tech and retail apples on the top ten list.
NEUT54|But what about Netflix?
NEUT55|What about Google?
NEUT56|And then there's?
NEUT57|Snaps and now back to American companies SNAP.
NEUT58|I mean how does snap get on this list when you're talking about profitability?
NEUT59|You're talking about market share revenue growth, right?
BEAR60|I think a lot of problems with our market value aspect of it.
NEUT61|They actually just made the cut.
BULL62|We ended our list in early April and the IPO did March, so 1.3 billion in IPO help kind of put them in mean it's it's a respectable debut.
NEUT63|There's something around 1600 or so, so it'll be interesting.
NEUT64|What happens to snap going forward at the top?
NEUT65|I mean the dominant companies you have are obviously Apple.
NEUT66|Most of the tech top companies are dominated by U.S. companies.
NEUT67|You have Samsung in there at #2 from South Korea, but for the most part you have apples.
NEUT68|Do you have Google which is now Alphabet?
BULL69|So it's a good round up.
NEUT70|You have a breakdown of tech financials etc in terms of sectors, yes absolutely.
NEUT71|On our site we kind of breaks them down and financials for for USI mean the top 10 is primarily financials.
NEUT72|You have Chinese banks, you have the large U.S. banks like JP Morgan and Wells Fargo and in terms of tax, you can definitely check those out on our site.
NEUT73|Alright, we'll do that.
BULL74|"However, thanks so much Artoria late joining us there from 4."""
