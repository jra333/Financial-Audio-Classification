BEAR0|"""And Speaking of ESPN, I always looked at that as like that's how they're going to hold on to the cable package to the traditional bundle, and it feels like it's becoming a real weak point for Disney."
NEUT1|Look, you listen to like an investor conference call like an earnings call for Disney, and virtually every question is on ESPN.
NEUT2|I mean, you people are actually apologizing like I have another ESPN question 'cause it's the question that just doesn't go away and the problem is, is that ESPN doesn't own its content?
NEUT3|You know you're going to shoot this video?
NEUT4|Business Insider is going to own this content.
NEUT5|You actually?
NEUT6|Own and control can monetize it however you want to.
NEUT7|The problem with ESPN is that there are renter of content.
NEUT8|They actually don't mean the biggest content they own.
NEUT9|Actually themselves Sports Center, which is really been devalued in a world where you turn on Twitter and you've got sports scores coming out of your ears.
NEUT10|So the content that ESPN has the stuff that's really high profile they rent and the problem with renting is all of these people with deep pockets that we were just talking about what steps I mean it's not so crazy to think of an Apple or in Amazon.
NEUT11|Taking over Monday Night Football in 2022?
NEUT12|Absolutely not.
NEUT13|That makes perfect sense if you want to take the highest profile.
BEAR14|If you want to destabilize the whole ecosystem, literally shatter the traditional media ecosystem.
NEUT15|The best way to do it would be to get football, because football to your point on ESPN Sports is what's holding the whole linear bundle together.
NEUT16|You attack sports and this whole thing shatters, and so I don't think it's crazy at all.
BEAR17|And so ESPN has falling subscribers.
NEUT18|But remember, they've locked in their cost, so they pay the NFL more every single year.
NEUT19|They pay the NBA more every year.
BEAR20|They pay all these four trades, keep escalating, they've got lower viewership because less people are watching linear TV, especially things like Sports Center, and they've got fewer subscribers.
NEUT21|CAS Cable subscribers probably a lot of the people.
NEUT22|As I look around your office, given their demographics are probably unlikely to be subscribers, you know, I think the younger generation is just not signing up for cable and even even older generations are looking at it.
NEUT23|Going by paying $120.00 a year from when I mean like what's?
NEUT24|To watch right now on network television, you know it's the summer.
NEUT25|You're probably watching Netflix or Amazon like.
NEUT26|Why are you subscribing to linear television?
BEAR27|"And I think it's leading to an acceleration of cord cutting that ESPN has no answer for."""
