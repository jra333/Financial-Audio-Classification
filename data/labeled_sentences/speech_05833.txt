NEUT0|"""Well, some traders welcome to another C space trading video."
BULL1|As always, subscribers and welcome all new subscribers guys are chunk 10 years grow and I appreciate the following.
NEUT2|So let's go ahead and hop into a technical analysis video on Facebook.
NEUT3|And if you've been following along, we will watch on Facebook for quite some time.
NEUT4|We would have a few trim lines here that we've drawn out a few weeks ago and this trend line here it goes dates back over 2017.
BEAR5|It's been uptrending recents.
BULL6|However, in the last month or so it actually broke this trend line.
BULL7|And now it is bouncing along this strong area of support right here at 160.
NEUT8|That's where it actually is sitting around today that have a good move up.
NEUT9|The data volume really wasn't that great.
NEUT10|There lot of volume here yesterday, which tells me there's a lot of volume alot of buying and explain that as you see this yesterday kind of come down and get this $160.00 mark and then you start seeing volume come in.
NEUT11|So this was a lot more in your average here a lot more in your average right at your average.
NEUT12|Here in the middle of the day, around lunchtime, not a whole lot of volume, but here it picks up again and then it added dip below that a lot more volume came in and push it right back up and then you so give me strong base here at 160 Mark so keep a close eye on that looking for a confirmation candle.
NEUT13|There's a couple of things in front of it that I see.
NEUT14|Is this trend line that comes up through here?
NEUT15|Is going to be a area of resistance so once it gets there is probably consolidate a little bit.
NEUT16|Another area of resistance is going to be this wedge here.
NEUT17|This was done that we've been watching.
NEUT18|Once it gets up, there is probably going to pull back a little bit of prosodic before popping through.
NEUT19|Or it comes back down and follow through.
BEAR20|Once this once 59 area is broken, volume search coming in, there's a strong possibility that they could fall down the 1:50 very quickly, so.
NEUT21|As we had this wage tightening up in the next few days and be happy to keep a close eye on Facebook 'cause it's about to be do or die if this thing could possibly pop up and take off.
BEAR22|Or it could fall out and head down.
NEUT23|So we're going to continue to watch.
NEUT24|We're looking for some confirmation.
NEUT25|We're looking for some more volume coming in possibly tomorrow or by the end of the week.
