NEUT0|"""A couple years ago I made a statement on air about how I'd like to know how rocket loans really do well, because, you know, we've got these banks that are unbelievable at it, and Jay Farner, who is the CEO, immediately set up a conference call with me and gave me the data."
NEUT1|The raw data of how they do.
BULL2|They are the best lender in the country.
NEUT3|They are the largest and the best.
NEUT4|They have tremendous systems, great controls, an it sat there, and one of the things I mean I got called about enlightened a couple times.
NEUT5|I said look, I don't know what to say.
NEUT6|I mean, they're giving her all she's got, but I think people feel when rates go higher.
BULL7|Members rates going higher today.
NEUT8|You don't own the stock and that's what most people must be saying.
BULL9|And then Jake came on and said, look, we have demonstrated tremendous controls and done a lot of volume.
NEUT10|Whether rates go up or rates go down.
BEAR11|So Carl, I think the stock can go down today, obviously.
BEAR12|It was some surges of people desperate to cover, but we also have to deal with the fact that interest rates just won't cut a break for this market.
BULL13|With the Dallas up about 200 points at 4:30 and now it's looking like we're going to have a tough day because rates moved up on.
NEUT14|Literally, we're all trying to figure it out because the ATP number wasn't that strong.
BEAR15|Yeah, although Jim there's a lot of consternation about 80P, either being perpetually out of sync with other data.
NEUT16|Take for example, open table seated diners.
NEUT17|I mean if you saw that number and then looked at ADP, you would think they were looking at two different economies.
NEUT18|So a lot of people out this morning, I know Capital Economics says we're going to stick with our view for Friday of half a million jobs.
NEUT19|I mean Friday is going to be really, really interesting.
NEUT20|Well, you get half million jobs.
NEUT21|Then I think that you have the Democrats who have been a voicing.
BULL22|Some criticism of a gigantic aid package, I think that their numbers could grow.
NEUT23|David, one of the things that you and I have both seen, is that the amount of money that's coming in dispatch the amount of money is being created is incredible an you add the amount of money that's being created to the amount of money that may be sent to Americans, and you could understand why the bond market vigilantes haven't used that term in a long time.
NEUT24|David are basically saying, oh come on.
NEUT25|I mean, you can't just keep printing money and I think that's going to be quite a reaction if we do a continual reaction.
NEUT26|If we do get.
NEUT27|Really big job, go number.
NEUT28|Yeah, but it still seems more likely than not that we're going to get the $1.9 trillion relief plan out of Congress, doesn't it?
NEUT29|I mean, it's going to be done via reconciliation.
NEUT30|It's no longer going to include a minimum wage adjustment.
NEUT31|You still have to say Jim.
NEUT32|That's more likely, although I understand your point and I'm sure that we're going to continue to be focused for months and months and months now on the prospect of inflation and just how much growth this economy really can withstand or actually handle to your point earlier.
NEUT33|Given her all she's got right?
NEUT34|Well, this just shapes wait until the last storm.
NEUT35|Is that this J PAL fed chief?
NEUT36|Does he say David?
NEUT37|You know what June?
NEUT38|I gotta make a move 'cause everyone's gonna be back soon?
NEUT39|Or is he just say you know what?
NEUT40|Let's see the jobs be created first.
NEUT41|You know the answer, at least the extent he's given it.
NEUT42|He said.
NEUT43|I'm going to wait.
NEUT44|Yeah, right bro.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
