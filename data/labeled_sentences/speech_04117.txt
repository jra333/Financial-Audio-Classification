BEAR0|"""Hey guys I recently purchased 400 shares of Facebook from my broker Questrade, and I'm going to tell you why I've been watching this stock ever since the initial release of its IPO, but I've been really worry about it because people are saying that it's overinflated that it's overvalued and it's worth only around $7.00 and I don't think so."
NEUT1|You know, I bought it at around $30 a share right here when it was going up and instantly, I made a profit.
BULL2|Of around $200, I believe it was from 400 shares and you know, I think by the end of the summer it's going to go up to around $50 a share.
NEUT3|You know, if the company will be valued at around 40 billion, it will be worth that much and you know, I think by October it will be close to $50 a share and by next summer it will be around $100 a share.
NEUT4|But I'm planning to sell it at around 50 to $70.00.
NEUT5|A share depending on you know how the graph looks.
NEUT6|So I'm really excited about this stock.
BULL7|I believe it's going to go up.
BEAR8|I believe it's undervalued when Netflix is $250 right now.
NEUT9|How can Facebook be, you know?
NEUT10|Only $30.00 so you know the right time to buy it was when it was around $18.00 a share.
NEUT11|$20 a share and now it's almost gone up by a third of its value.
NEUT12|So or half of its value when it was $20 and now it's sort of gone back to its initial.
NEUT13|Price, which it was offered at the very beginning of the IPO, initial public offering.
NEUT14|So you know, I'm really excited.
BULL15|I think the stock is going to go up, and if you're with me, you should you know, buy it too.
BEAR16|"And if you're not then put in the comments why you think it's it's a bad buy anyway, thanks for watching."""
