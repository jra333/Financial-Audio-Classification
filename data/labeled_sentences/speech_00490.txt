NEUT2|If we change the charge into daily chart we can see here with it still got a green candle here after yesterday's big.
NEUT3|Jump so as I can see here the buying.
BEAR4|Statue for the stock has been a little bit overbought in this data as we can see here.
BEAR5|We got a small lower tail.
NEUT6|That means there still buying power supporting, but in short term, is it still a little bit overboard in mid term?
BULL7|We are still well above in the uptrend channel because we are well about this point.
NEUT8|This is the mid term formal high and then we got another higher high here so we can see here is just like a standard.
