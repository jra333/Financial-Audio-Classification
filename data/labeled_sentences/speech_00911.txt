NEUT1|I will be talking about Transenterix stock.
NEUT2|I know I'm saying that wrong ticker symbol TRXC and I will give you guys some key levels.
NEUT3|Some predictions now some analysts on this stock and where I see it going forward.

BULL6|OK and just want to say thank you for all the love on the channel so far.
BULL7|I really appreciate it.
NEUT8|So I have about 3 levels here.
NEUT9|Up to this first level right here is level $4.74.
NEUT10|This is where I wanted to buy below right 'cause I think this price is high, but as you can tell what happened today.
NEUT11|It opened, trade it down.
NEUT12|Right and then start trading higher like I told you guys to watch out for it was to do trade down and then they start shooting up.
NEUT13|Came back down and then shut up.
NEUT14|OK so this was from this low to this high.
BULL15|Well over 27% in one day, which is a very big move.
NEUT16|So now I'm trying to see how it wants to move, right?
NEUT17|So if this starts opening up Monday and start trading higher, then I will find a new level to buy right?
NEUT18|So it did close around $6.25 an it is currently at six 12616 after hours so we need to see how it opens up on Monday, but I still want to buy at this level or below.
NEUT19|OK 474 and below.
BULL20|I think this would be a good price level in between here.
NEUT21|And this line right here was a resistance turned to support, so that's why this line is here.
NEUT22|And then this line right here at 2074 cents, is just another support area.
NEUT23|Just in case if it broke this right here, then this is where I thought some more buying would be at right, but it held right there pretty good and you could tell it came resist it came down, broke through it right this move right here.
NEUT24|But it will show you that is bullish broke through it.
NEUT25|Came down, opened up, came down, tested as support shot higher, never came back down here anymore and started taking off right and we had the run up.
NEUT26|It did have to pull back.
NEUT27|Right and then came up again.
BULL28|So I do think well I would like to see some more pullback.
NEUT29|I wanted to come down below this level right?
NEUT30|This level again is $4.74.
NEUT31|So just have this lovely chart.
NEUT32|If it comes below there then I will start buying.
NEUT33|But if it doesn't start to come here, come down here of on Monday or next week, then we'll have to see for a new entry.
NEUT34|Or I might even play it intraday.
NEUT35|Like if it did something like this.
NEUT36|If I saw some movement like this, are movement like this, then I'll probably play intraday play, so make sure you guys are in a Discord chat link down below.
NEUT37|It will be going private, so you have to be a member on my Patreon page there's one for like $3 a month, so it's very low, so I probably will be playing in today, but I have to see how it opens up on Monday.
NEUT38|But if it does come down here, I'll be buying.
NEUT39|If it comes below here, I'll be buying, but if it falls below here then I will be waiting.
NEUT40|But if it does start to trend higher then I will wait.
NEUT41|But I think if pricing gets around $6.80 then I think price will go above $7.00 or higher.
NEUT42|OK but we have to see how it opens up next week and that is how I'm playing this stock.
BULL43|Hope you guys like the video.
