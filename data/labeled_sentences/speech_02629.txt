NEUT0|"""I want to write to a chart that you sent over to us and it's about global within a global trade war."
NEUT1|What the impact would be on GDP growth, and I think ultimately all of this will come down to this.
NEUT2|The impact on growth and this is what we need to really focus on.
NEUT3|Tell us a little about this chart.
NEUT4|So what we do here is we evaluate the effect of tariffs.
NEUT5|This would be tariffs on all Chinese products, 25% tariffs on German and Japanese automobiles and 5% tariffs on Mexico.
NEUT6|These are ones that have been broached and some of them have been.
NEUT7|Implemented so the tariff effect is about 25 basis points off of global growth, so you can see our projection from our major global economic outlook.
NEUT8|That's the line history and the projection.
BEAR9|So the tariff effect alone is about 25 basis points off of global growth.
NEUT10|But then we evaluate the consequences of the tariffs for a potential equity market correction, and we've worked with our equity analysts to evaluate that about 10% global equity market correction.
NEUT11|And then we also incorporate.
BEAR12|Uncertainty, as we said, there's a lot of uncertainty that continues to persist and those factors are what undermines real investment and reduces global GDP even more so.
BULL13|The tariffs are just the beginning of this cascade through the financial markets accentuated in augmented by uncertainty to a road investment lead to rising unemployment and lower consumption.
BEAR14|An all that put together puts us into a situation of a global growth recession.
NEUT15|Something like like the global financial crisis.
NEUT16|Well and I think about just tying it back to politics.
NEUT17|Here we are getting ready for a nap.
NEUT18|Election year right?
NEUT19|All of this will matter.
NEUT20|All this no matter in this global scenario, which of course may not happen.
NEUT21|But nevertheless there is there some pieces of it in place an we don't know.
NEUT22|But there's not one year there's multiple layers, multiple layers an for the US, from our base case of 2% in 2020, we would get to 1% growth rate in 2020, so it matters not just globally, but it matters.
NEUT23|Kind of at home too, but give me a sensitivity here base case.
NEUT24|Let's assume we just hold still with China, not more tariffs.
NEUT25|We don't get it all fixed.
NEUT26|We get USMC A through the successor to NAFTA.
NEUT27|And we don't go to war with Europe.
NEUT28|That's one plausible sense set of scenarios, right?
NEUT29|What happens then?
NEUT30|So again, the issue is, is how much to do equity markets and other bond markets are willing to accept?
NEUT31|Sort of a partial outcome because it's, you know we aren't talking about taking off tariffs at this point.
NEUT32|We're talking about just a ceasefire.
NEUT33|And the thing about tariffs is the threat of tariffs and the threat of other types of investment restrictions and so forth.
NEUT34|"Are enough to really alter the sentiment, the brackets and therefore the real economy."""
