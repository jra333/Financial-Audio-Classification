BULL0|"""Chuck Schumer should get back into Washington and they should approve stimulus for the people they should give."
NEUT1|We should give some of this was China's fault.
NEUT2|It wasn't their fault and we'd like to see payment going to the people, maybe PPE, but we want paper payment going to the people will take care of the post office.
NEUT3|We want to make sure.
NEUT4|That's a post office runs properly and it hasn't run properly for many years for probably 50 years it's run very badly, so we want to make sure that the Post Office runs properly and doesn't lose billions of dollars.
BEAR5|Somebody said it lost $78 billion over a relatively short period of time.
NEUT6|That's over years $78 billion.
NEUT7|So you can have that.
NEUT8|No, we will work with them, but we want money to go to the people that need it and they don't want to do that.
BEAR9|They just want to take care of the bailout money they want bailout money to go to their friends that are doing a bad job running Democrat State.
BEAR10|Losing a lot of money, they've been poorly run by Democrats for many years, and that's all they want to talk about.
NEUT11|Is bailing out those states?
BEAR12|That's unfair to the rest of the country.
BEAR13|Are you worried up cutbacks in service affecting people getting medication and for the Post office is running very well.
NEUT14|The Post office now look if you look at the Post office for years, that's all people complained about.
BULL15|We're going to run it well and we're going to not lose so much money.
BEAR16|One of the things the Post office is losing so much money on is delivering packages for Amazon and these others every time they deliver a package, they probably lose.
NEUT17|3 or $4.
BEAR18|That's not good.
NEUT19|They have to raise those prices.
NEUT20|OK, not for the people to pay, but for Amazon and those companies to pay.
BULL21|Thank you very much.
NEUT22|1,000,000 ballots.
NEUT23|Why are you opposed to Mail in ballots when they cannot be hacked by Florida?
NEUT24|Register reference.
NEUT25|Absentee ballots are great.
NEUT26|You request a ballot you can't be.
NEUT27|I signed an absentee ballot.
NEUT28|Absentee ballots are great.
NEUT29|They work.
BULL30|They've been proven that good, like in Florida.
NEUT31|But this Universal Mail in is a very dangerous thing.
NEUT32|It's fraught with fraud, and every other thing that can happen.
NEUT33|And we have to be very, very careful.
NEUT34|We have a very big election coming up.
BULL35|I think we're gonna do very well and I want to make sure the election is not stolen and so does everybody else.
BULL36|And I'm sure both sides feel that way.
NEUT37|So we have to be very careful with this universal Mail in ballot.
NEUT38|Absentee ballots are great.
NEUT39|They've worked for a long time and I I totally endorse absentee ballots.
NEUT40|Thank you very much, anything.
NEUT41|The Postmaster General of Big donors here just slow the Mail.
NEUT42|No, not at all.
NEUT43|Wouldn't do that.
NEUT44|Now I have encouraged everybody beat up the Mail, not slow the Mail and I also want to have a post office that runs without losing billions and billions of dollars a year as it has been doing for 50 years.
BULL45|"Thank you."""
