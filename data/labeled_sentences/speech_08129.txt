BULL0|"""Delivery is picking up steam in the United States."
BULL1|Analysts reject a steady increase in the share of delivery sales at restaurants over the next several years.
NEUT2|But what's convenient for customers might not be best for the restaurants.
BEAR3|Part of the challenge is the cost of working with third party apps, which analysts say will be servicing many of these orders, but this trend is hitting a nerve in the restaurant business.
NEUT4|These bar charts can help explain why this analysis compares meal prices for cost for in store service and delivery by a third party app when restaurants serve food in their store, their margins are up to 69% of the total check and the same meal ordered VN app.
NEUT5|Well, that's the price of convenience for you.
BEAR6|Additional costs in labor, packing and fees to the apps make the profit margin sink to 39% of the total check.
NEUT7|On average, food sellers will pay third party services.
NEUT8|A fee of 10 to 25% on each order.
BEAR9|Vendors who partner with third party apps also lose control over valuable customer data.
NEUT10|For restaurants who want to bypass third party apps and still get into the delivery game, there are other costs considered.
NEUT11|Panera's delivery business.
NEUT12|The chain spent six years building it.
NEUT13|It costs upwards of $100 million to develop its online ordering system.
BEAR14|That investment cut into profits for three years, but the effort began to pay off in 2016.
NEUT15|Today, each delivery costs about $5 after accounting for labor, gas and packaging, but to avoid turning away customers, Panera charges a flat delivery fee.
NEUT16|Of $3 per order in most markets, this means that they have to sell a lot more per order to absorb those costs.
NEUT17|Many smaller restaurants can afford that kind of investment order.
NEUT18|Taking systems must be developed, drivers have to be hired.
NEUT19|A third party app might take care of those logistics, but they take a Commission and typically customers aren't keen to pay the difference.
BEAR20|According to a survey by Tillster, 85% of consumers aren't willing to pay more than $5 for restaurant delivery, and customers may wind up unhappy anyway because many restaurants sell food that doesn't travel well.
BEAR21|This analysis from Conan Co reveals a rise in the share of orders from Steakhouses and Burger chains delivery staples like Pizza or Indian Foods, are losing pace.
NEUT22|But the businesses that previously dominated the delivery market sold food that can stay tasty for longer periods of time.
NEUT23|Whereas say French fries prepped in store probably won't make it to your doorstep, tasting their best.
BEAR24|And when that order of fries shows up cold, consumers tend to blame the food seller, even if it was delivered by a third party app.
BULL25|Despite the shortcomings, the rise of delivery seems inevitable.
BULL26|"Though the field is crowded, third party delivery platforms are expected to rise in value over the next few years, which means that, like it or not, many urban restaurants may soon have to embrace a brave new world of food delivery."""
