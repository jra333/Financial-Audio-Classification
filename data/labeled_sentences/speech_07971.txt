NEUT0|"""What is the S&P 500?"
NEUT1|It's an index comprised of the 500 largest publicly traded companies by market cap.
NEUT2|So basically the 500 most influential US publicly traded companies.
NEUT3|Now it's a market cap weighted index.
NEUT4|So the companies that are disproportionately larger like Apple and Exxon make up the large had the most influence over the index.
NEUT5|Well, maybe smaller.
NEUT6|More obscure companies like Mako Surgical or First Solar at the low end have a much lower waiting.
NEUT7|I prefer the SMP as a. Benchmarker or true indication of how the markets doing over an index like the Dow Jones industrials average for that very same reason, the Dow only comprises 30 components and its price weighted.
BEAR8|So if a company has a higher share price that will have a disproportionate waiting on the index.
NEUT9|I like that the SNP is market cap weighted and I believe that provides a much more accurate picture of what the market is doing on a day to day basis.
NEUT10|Now, granted, the SMP isn't perfect, it's not a truly complete measure of all investable securities out there, but because it represents the 500 largest an.
NEUT11|Most commonly traded securities.
NEUT12|It's it's a 95% accurate gauge for exactly how the market is doing, so I personally use the S&P 500 as a benchmark for my own portfolio to test my performance to see.
NEUT13|Am I outperforming the market or am I underperforming the market and I believe many investors would be wise to use it in the same manner.
NEUT14|"Boo."""
