BEAR0|"""If we get a stimulus package, Coral Ann, you're out of the market."
BEAR1|You will feel awful.
NEUT2|I do feel that the stimulus package is very hard to get, but if we do get a coral, you can't be out of this market.
NEUT3|Just cut down the exposure to the highest tech stocks.
NEUT4|That's all I'm asking.
NEUT5|Yep, Meadows today who was on our air yesterday, did say produces open to 1 1/2 trillion to meet with some airline executives later on today.
NEUT6|This is Meadows.
NEUT7|On the other hand I mean.
NEUT8|I know a lot of the DC reporters are going to watch to see how many Members are going home to campaign, so I mean it's going to be to a large degree, a role.
BULL9|You just have headcount of who's sticking around in anticipation of any deal, but we've done so many stories here about the other part of the economy, and there's a piece today that's really excellent, recommending Darden, which is Olive Garden, and they're talking about how once they start getting third party delivery they'll do great.
NEUT10|But what is Olive Garden doing right now?
NEUT11|They're doing.
NEUT12|The reformatting of the floor of the restaurant.
BULL13|She they had the money to be able to make it so that they could cut that seats in half and still do well, but what the stimulus has to do is be targeted to all the companies we know.
NEUT14|They can't make it.
BEAR15|You know that we're seeing lots of pieces now about companies coming in and buying up the leases because so many mom and pop stores are going under.
NEUT16|Is that good?
NEUT17|"No, that's why I think that's maybe this was."""
