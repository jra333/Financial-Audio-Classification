NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, a very choppy day on this one, but within the choppiness a couple of very key levels have now revealed themselves that a lot of people will be watching next week, so I don't want to come across like this is some sort of great discovery on my order that I have some sort of special skill.
NEUT5|Nothing like that at the exact opposite.
NEUT6|I assure you that people that use charts understand charts will have taken notice of these levels, and they'll be watching them, and I bring all that up because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing, called a cell fulfilling prophecy, call it whatever you want.
NEUT7|It can definitely produce some very dynamic movements, so that's what I want to focus on here.
NEUT8|But the first level that all sorts of people are going to be watching, rightfully so.
NEUT9|I mean, it makes perfect sense to watch it.
NEUT10|But down here at the $130.25 mark, I mean you go through the history of the chart and one 3025, generally speaking, great job holding support holding support this morning once again this afternoon holding support.
NEUT11|So while nothing is guaranteed.
BEAR12|My point here is just that it's a more than valid thought to have that if the price comes down here to one 3025 and breaks down through there that break in and of itself could create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
NEUT13|Again, not guaranteed to happen, but a more than legitimate and rational thoughts have, so that will be one of the key areas of support to watch.
NEUT14|On the flip side of things, as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT15|Key level to watch right up there at one 3265, which you can see today.
NEUT16|Basically a little miniature double top formation top number.
NEUT17|One top #2.
NEUT18|So that's gonna be level were again same exact logic.
NEUT19|Nothing's guaranteed, but more than valid more than rational to think that if the price can creep its way back up there and then get a break up through that level.
BEAR20|That break could very well create quite a bit of upside.
BULL21|Buying pressure and momentum from all those breakout players.
NEUT22|So you're going to want to keep a close eye on that too.
NEUT23|But All in all choppy day, but because of the choppiness, we now have a couple of well defined areas, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT24|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT26|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL27|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT28|The first key is super weird.
NEUT29|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT30|But in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT35|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT36|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT37|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT38|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT39|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
