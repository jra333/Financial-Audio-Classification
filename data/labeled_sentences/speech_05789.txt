BULL0|"""Kelly, it's no secret that Amazon has set its sights on health care, and now the giant is looking to expand its employee Amazon care."
NEUT1|This is a Tele health program that they had launched last year.
NEUT2|Now they're looking to launch it for other employers.
NEUT3|Amazon care.
NEUT4|Is this virtual care program that includes home visits.
NEUT5|They launched their for their employees in Seattle about a year ago.
BULL6|Business Insider reporting that it has been reaching out to other employers about offering the plan now.
NEUT7|Officials at Zillow confirming to CNBC.
NEUT8|That they did talk to Amazon about this, but at the moment they are not going to move forward.
BULL9|And that's where that stayed nonetheless.
BEAR10|The news hitting Tele health firms like Teladoc and Amwell hard?
NEUT11|They've targeted employers and health systems to provide similar virtual primary care services.
NEUT12|One medical which is another competitor in this space which went public this year also would be a potential competitor.
BEAR13|Well, good RX is also lower lower after today expanding its services beyond pharmacy discounts to offer members virtual doctor.
NEUT14|It's now Amazon recently launched its own pharmacy.
NEUT15|As we know for its prime members that includes a discount program, but that came after three years of acquiring Pillpack.
NEUT16|It takes a while to build these things up, and it could also take time to establish virtual care service.
NEUT17|You know.
BULL18|Obviously Covid has made both providers and patients much more willing to use this service, but at this point it's still very early and very competitive.
NEUT19|A spokesperson for Amazon says.
NEUT20|They don't comment on speculation, but she added.
NEUT21|Amazon Care is a health care benefit pilot for Amazon employees right now in the state of Washington Kelly.
NEUT22|And birth, I didn't catch that until you mentioned it.
NEUT23|The Good RX is now launched Tele Health.
NEUT24|That's surprising to me.
NEUT25|I don't know if it was expected.
NEUT26|It's one of those things where all of these firms are trying to expand beyond just doing the one doctor visit.
NEUT27|So for good RX it makes sense to move into this space because oftentimes when people are looking for a lower cost alternative, one of the things is to have access to Tele Health.
NEUT28|But people no longer want just a one and done sort of urgent care Tele health call for when your kid has an earache and might have an ear infection to be able to have.
NEUT29|A bit more of a relationship so that when you call, you're not just talking to a Doctor Who's a stranger.
NEUT30|Someone who knows your track record that is the Holy Grail right now, Amazon is looking.
NEUT31|It seems to try to offer that in that Amazon way for other employers, yeah.
NEUT32|It's fascinating, Bertha, thanks for bringing that to us our Bertha Coombs, as we watch those stocks under pressure today.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
