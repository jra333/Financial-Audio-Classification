NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know she would behave."
NEUT1|We met with another, less guarding it right into it.
NEUT2|No one like to waste nobody time before we do that, let's get this video.
NEUT3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people than they would be touching base on Genesys brings.
NEUT4|Let's take a symbol GNUS.
NEUT5|We talked about this talk a few times on the channel, so we go too much in detail.
NEUT6|We gonna just be giving out, you know, entry points, exit points, let you know it's important resistance at, and let you know where a good spot to get in it now and good spot to sell that.
NEUT7|So it's going right into it, yeah?
NEUT8|So genius brains we close at about 2044 cents.
BEAR9|We update 2.5% at the hours we grew another 2% we opened at 238 the House 241, the lowest 231 to 52 week high was 1173 to 52 week low as $0.20.
BULL10|So if we look on the day chart, we got a nice solid support around $2.30.
NEUT11|That's the ideal first target where you could get in there right around $2.30.
BULL12|Right around 2:32 to be exact, we got a nice former support and that was our previous resistance where we need help getting through now that stuff showing as a former support.
NEUT13|If we break that 232 on our way up 'cause right now we supposed to be up to retest at $3 Mart.
BULL14|That's what we own our way too 'cause we already broke through resistance at 2016 cents.
BEAR15|So, but before we get it at three, if we experience any pool bags, I could see this thing pulling back right around $2.18.
BEAR16|It could pull back to 218.
NEUT17|I will grab some more shares and then if we see this same pull all the way back to 181 ninety, I get some more shares.
NEUT18|We might not see their price, but you want to be prepared.
BEAR19|And then on our awkward on our side we had a resistance at $2.40.
NEUT20|Then we broke through that we finally broke through it in after hours.
BULL21|We reached $2.46 later.
NEUT22|There's no.
BULL23|We had a strong strong uptrend by breaking through that resistance.
BULL24|That was a good sign once we broke through that resistance at 246, we also ended the day still up broken through their resistance.
BEAR25|We closed at 244.
BULL26|Another good sign.
NEUT27|Nice, bullish or training.
BULL28|So now if we look on our three month chart we gotta another resistance up at $3.06.
NEUT29|That's what we on track to hit from 2000.
NEUT30|44 seen this tank of plywood with three oh seat squeak, and that's what we got.
NEUT31|A former resistance at right around 3:06 and 3:13 once we bust through that I need target.
NEUT32|Price will be three.
NEUT33|55355 illegal is straight to around 4 feet and I exit point for this will be around.
NEUT34|We could get out at her double up with get out around $4.50.
NEUT35|Four 75 five dollars anywhere my dear we can get out and then we can get back in on the deal once it hit those levels.
NEUT36|Is going to do it back down hard.
NEUT37|You can read and write this thing right back up to six, $7.00 and then you already know how we do once we get those lives, we can still have our position and let the rest of our position ride on free shares.
NEUT38|So that's how we will play different guys.
NEUT39|I just want to let you know where the support resistance an nice entry points.
NEUT40|I told y'all where to get in at told you I would get out of it, so that's all I got for this video.
NEUT41|I like these type of updates.
NEUT42|These type predictions consider joining the family.
NEUT43|You post this type of stuff every single day.
NEUT44|She will behave.
NEUT45|We all love you.
BULL46|"God bless."""
