NEUT0|"""Everyone welcome back to your daily Penny stock updates."
BULL1|Today we're talking about 3 very cheap companies including ones in the oil sector and a number one stock pushing up over 1000% in a single day.
NEUT2|Alright guys, we gotta get right into it today.
NEUT3|Starting out with number 3 and we're going to go in the order from least gains the most gains.
NEUT4|So here we have it.
NEUT5|MNP Petroleum Corporation.
NEUT6|Their stock ticker is M&AP.
BULL7|Now they're up 3.85% today and somewhere like 700% in the last year, this wouldn't be one of our penny stock videos if we didn't at least cover one oil and gas exploration company.
NEUT8|And that's exactly what this stock does.
NEUT9|Trading at just two cents.
BULL10|Now we're seeing an overall increase in the entire oil sector.
NEUT11|So these kinds of small penny stocks do have quite a big advantage right now because everyone is struggling and you might be able to flip this stock for a lot of money.
BULL12|Alright, moving on to our #2 stock for today.
BULL13|This is when we have talked about before in our last video about 3 days ago, so we're talking about you, a multimedia and their stock ticker is, Umm, it's up about 4% today and it's recently crossed it's $0.10 Mark because this stock has seen an increase of well over 3000% in the last year.
BULL14|And after a video it's also been doing very well now.
BEAR15|Like I said before guys, this is a cannabis stock that has put all its current projects on hold.
NEUT16|In the pursuit of becoming a crypto and blockchain company now they currently operates a blockchain technology that they're serving out so many businesses and they're trying to make this very accessible for the public, so that's why we've seen such a massive increase in this company right here.
NEUT17|UA, Multimedia, and their stock ticker is, Umm, definitely keep it on your watchlist because a lot of people are trying to get into this stock right now, then moving on to our number one stock for this video, and I kid you not as I was setting up to record this video.
BULL18|It was only up 700% today.
NEUT19|Right now it's sitting at about.
BULL20|1100% and it just crossed that Mark.
NEUT21|However, no new news about this company has come out.
BULL22|It's been struggling during the pandemic, but today it's up over 1200%.
NEUT23|The numbers just keep going up for this stock, so you might be wondering what they do and if I would have straight up told you from the beginning you would probably not believe me, but this is a company with a market cap of only 5,000,000.
NEUT24|That designs, develops and manufacturers, men and women footwear.
NEUT25|Now they're all doing this under their own brand, which is very interesting to me, but maybe one of you will find refuge in this stuck.
NEUT26|It is up an insane amount, so I'm here to report on it.
NEUT27|Definitely keep Ari stock ticker AURI on your watch list, because it's absolutely insane and I can't wait for any news to come out about this company.
BULL28|Ever since I started looking at it, it's gone up over 500%, so again, a lot of millionaires were made on the stock market today.
NEUT29|And if you want to catch these amazing opportunities directly when they come up, be sure you're subscribed to the channel as well.
BULL30|And if you made it all the way to the end, I really appreciate that.
