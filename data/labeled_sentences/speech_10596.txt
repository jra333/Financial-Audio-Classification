NEUT0|"""Under Armour perhaps going to be a feature today, Jim, they have received a wells notice, yeah?"
NEUT1|Voice suboptimal to get a wells notice.
BEAR2|This is the SEC saying that look they're going to have to bring violence charges of violations of the Federal securities laws, meaning that they did something wrong in this particular case.
NEUT3|It's Balsam 2016 alleged channel stuffing, and I think that this is Kevin Plank and the CFO David Bergman.
NEUT4|Going to face this.
NEUT5|Now what's important is the company does report later this week.
NEUT6|In my understanding of the case, the case does not involve revenue recognition.
NEUT7|There will be.
NEUT8|No restatement as I understand it.
NEUT9|So if you're selling the stock betting, there's going to be a restatement there for them to pull any sort of financial firms, say the next year.
NEUT10|That's a mistake you have to buy it on the strength or weakness of the fundamentals.
NEUT11|I'm not saying it's a side show a wells notice is very important.
NEUT12|I am saying that there will be no SEC decision to punish them to the point where Kevin Pike distance.
NEUT13|You have to leave the company.
NEUT14|Yeah, no, it's a good point.
NEUT15|We should explain a wells notice is when the SEC staff says it is at least made a preliminary determination to recommend to the Commission that in fact at enforcement action be taken against the company.
NEUT16|But to your point, Jim, it's about pulling sales forward, so you execute a sale.
NEUT17|You know you earlier than originally planned, and it does have the.
BULL18|Obviously it's done to make a quarter look better than might otherwise have, but overall it doesn't affect how many sales.
BULL19|Really took place over a longer period exactly and I think that people have recognized that they had this really long streak of up numbers and they wanted to maintain it.
NEUT20|I think that what the SEC may be off base on this is that is that Mark Parker decided to destroy Under Armour.
NEUT21|That was a conscious decision.
NEUT22|They lowered prices and a lot of the stuff that was need an anticompetitive Nike every ability to do that, but also 'cause it didn't get cold and Kevin Plank at the absolute wrong inventory for not being cold and you also he had excuse me, was making sure she's making.
NEUT23|Pants, who's making shoes?
NEUT24|He was making some sort of weird thing.
NEUT25|It's wrapped around your chest to be able to measure how you're doing and if they were off the reservation.
BEAR26|So it really did hurt them.
NEUT27|What matters is that they're in a very competitive category and they kind of miss being lululemon an they couldn't take on Nike, which is to be Nike is a colossus.
NEUT28|"I like Nike here at 98."""
