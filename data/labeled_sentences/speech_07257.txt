NEUT0|"""T. Rex restart with one hour chart in preferred over analyzing since the price was within this exactly here, we mention how we can look for the trade and even we mention if we get any short move the flag or having in shape of the top and this is what we get."
NEUT1|There was an opportunity here and the second opportunity which we didn't have the trade setup and now we want to see what the next because if we get any trade stuff from here is there we can look for by but we need to be aware that whatever the trade we have here we have to start to manage because if you put this top relative to each other is.
BULL2|We estimated start to show us a divergance.
NEUT3|Mostly the divergent snow we can expect to get a correction for continuity, another reversal, but at least we need to know how to trade.
NEUT4|I mean, manage your trades, and even if you move to daily chart, this is what we get and I want to see where how high can go before we get the correction for continuity and we need to be aware that we can expect to get that guy.
NEUT5|I mean to get a correction and the next correction.
NEUT6|Mostly we can expect to be a big correction than what we get here or more complex correction may similar to what we have here.
NEUT7|We need we cannot confirm right now.
NEUT8|The only thing says.
NEUT9|We need to be aware and maybe if you want to look for by we need to have a proper management, forward traits and even if we move to forward chart, first of all we want to see whether either wrap divergance or not make the doesn't show us, but then other indicators show us the divergance.
NEUT10|That's why we want to see how we can trade this one.
NEUT11|Mostly this correction we can we get.
NEUT12|I mean if you get any trade we can look for the next move.
NEUT13|All right now the question can be this one similar to what we have here or bigger?
NEUT14|This is the things we need to bear in mind.
NEUT15|We want to see.
NEUT16|I mean if you get any trade setup.
NEUT17|As I mentioned, based on daily chart we need to be examined.
BULL18|We need to be aware that we we can expect to get a bigger correction either here or at the higher price.
NEUT19|This is the only things I need to highlight rather than that any trade setup we get.
NEUT20|We look for why an if we want to trade here.
NEUT21|We don't have any trade setup.
NEUT22|OK, one of the option the best if this one becomes more complex.
NEUT23|Or any short movie The flag we can look for trade if the prices start to reverse from here, but if this one becomes deeper it can give us better correct?
NEUT24|I mean trade setup.
NEUT25|Can we have entry above desktop also one of the option but?
NEUT26|It depends on the traders because simply the price can tag and reverse.
NEUT27|We don't want to buy at the top even we have a divergance here.
NEUT28|OK, because if we want to have in trouble that he wants to price tag breaking company here and for this I think the price tag immediately even.
NEUT29|Within the first hour we see there is not.
NEUT30|There is no continuation.
NEUT31|We don't stay with that rate.
NEUT32|We take out the trade, by the way.
NEUT33|Still, we can look for by with any correction.
NEUT34|If we get we trade based on the small correction, for example, similar to what we have here on you of this, we consider as a short term.
NEUT35|As long as we get into the profit.
NEUT36|But if this one tend to more complex, similar to what we have here.
NEUT37|We then it can give us better confirmation, by the way, we just follow the chart.
NEUT38|"If I see any update, I will share, thanks."""
