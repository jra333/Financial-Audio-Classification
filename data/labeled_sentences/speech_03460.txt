NEUT0|"""Hey guys, it's really in your heart stop girl today I'm going to discuss General Motors, ticker symbol, GM, GM, makes cars and trucks that are sold worldwide."
NEUT1|Recently I discussed Ford stock even though Ford was trading at a value stock, I didn't recommend buying forward because of the decline in its recent financial performance and the downgrade on its credit rating by Moodys GM is also treating in the value stock range with an enterprise value to IBRA ratio of about 6.
NEUT2|Usually companies that are trading at only six times Deborah are not growing revenues, but GM is an exception.
BULL3|GM reported very strong third quarter results with strong truck sales and higher sales prices leading the way the stock jumped on the news since it's moved up from the $30 trading range to the $35 trading range.
NEUT4|So is now the time to buy GM.
NEUT5|GM is paying a nice 4% dividend.
NEUT6|But what does the future hold for for growth?
NEUT7|Looking further into GM.
NEUT8|Earnings press release.
BEAR9|We find that third quarter sales volume actually dropped 14.7%.
BEAR10|In fact, sales declined for every brand and across every region forecast for 2019 on new automobile sales.
NEUT11|Do not look great.
BULL12|The FedEx expected to raise interest rates three more times in 2019, which will increase least prices and surely impact sales longer term more people are using Uber and Lyft, which makes it easier for people living in a big city to forgo even.
BEAR13|Owning a car there is also a risk that using gas rising gas prices could slow down the sales of larger trucks.
BULL14|An SVS, though I think GM is currently in better shape than Ford.
NEUT15|I can't recommend either stock.
NEUT16|I don't see a catalyst that would change them into a growth stock in as a value stock.
BEAR17|I worry bout the overall decline in unit sales.
NEUT18|There are many better places to invest for long term growth and value than GM so there you have it.
