BEAR0|"""Shares of Lyft popped in the after hours on Tuesday, February 9th because it reported its fourth quarter earnings."
NEUT1|Let's take a look at the report and if it belongs in your portfolio, here are some of the key numbers out of Lyft's report.
BEAR2|They reported a loss per share of $0.58 versus the estimated $0.72 they beat on revenue at 570,000,000, versus the estimated 563 million.
BEAR3|They missed an active riders, while only reporting 12.55 million riders versus the estimate of 13.2 million riders, but their revenue per active writer.
BULL4|Actually be at $45.50 versus the average of $42.20.
NEUT5|Now let's break down some of those numbers.
BEAR6|Their loss per share was a fairly big beat at $0.14, and for those of you unaware, lift is not profitable at the moment.
NEUT7|But based on this beat as well as other analysts expectations and estimates, they will be profitable or should be profitable by this time next year.
BEAR8|They did miss an active writers.
NEUT9|However, I think we're going to give them a pass on that one since it's a pandemic.
NEUT10|And all that fun stuff like I don't really know.
NEUT11|Like yes, I'm aware that that's a key metric for this company because that's what they do.
BEAR12|Currently, we're in unprecedented times with the pandemic.
NEUT13|No one's really going anywhere.
NEUT14|I think we're going to put that one on the back burner.
NEUT15|We're definitely going to look at it for future earnings reports, but for this one it's going to shove that one under the rug.
BEAR16|The company did come out and say that demand was negatively impacted due to a surge of coronavirus cases and efforts to try and slow down the virus.
BEAR17|The company has failed, however, in.
BULL18|Its ability to bulk up in additional segments, like its main competitor Huber, in an effort to replace lost revenue from the pandemic.
NEUT19|Goober focused on food and its delivery segments with Uber eats.
NEUT20|Lyft has yet to grow into a delivery business.
BULL21|The company did say last quarter that it is working on expanding into the delivery service by consulting with restaurants as well as retailers.
BEAR22|Lift lacks revenue streams outside of ride sharing and is only operable in North America and has struggled because of the United States inability to contain the virus.
BULL23|The stock has returned to pre pandemic highs of around 53 to $54.00.
BULL24|So good job now.
NEUT25|Let's take a look at what some of the analysts have to say about the stock.
NEUT26|If we take a look at what the analysts were saying three months ago about lift, 24 of them had buy ratings, 14 head holds while two of them were selling with a overweight consensus, whereas today it's pretty much unchanged.
NEUT27|The average price target on left is $49.71, while at the time of this video the stock price is around.
NEUT28|$53 so it's pretty much exactly where the analysts want it to be.
NEUT29|The highest price target for lift is $70.00, while the lowest price target is $10.
BULL30|And if we look at the six month chart on the left in the past six months, it is up 72%.
BEAR31|However, looking at the 12 month chart, it is in the red being down .15%.
BEAR32|Now obviously that is almost entirely because of the pandemic, but after these earnings it seems to have gotten back to its pre pandemic highs at the end of the day.
NEUT33|If you want to invest in some sort of ride sharing business.
NEUT34|You pretty much only have two options in terms of Lyft and Uber.
NEUT35|Now obviously I cannot sit here and tell you which one to buy.
NEUT36|I am in neither of them, Full disclosure, but if you prefer one of the other, let me know down in the comments below.

NEUT38|Are you planning on getting in?
