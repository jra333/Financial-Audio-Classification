NEUT0|"""Options insight I'm Abigail Doolittle."
NEUT1|Joining me today from the Seabaugh in Chicago is Alan Nachman of Aghora Financial.
BULL2|Great to have you here on this phase one trade deal signing day and initially not too much of a reaction.
BEAR3|A little bit of pairing of games with the NASDAQ just turned slightly lower.
NEUT4|The socks.
BEAR5|That's where we really have seen a bit of a sell.
BEAR6|The news reaction down more than 1%.
NEUT7|You think that this is just a modest consolidation having nothing to do with that radial or.
BULL8|Sign of more things to come.
BULL9|I think there's just more upside potential here.
BULL10|We've gone straight up new highs almost every single day for the last couple of weeks.
NEUT11|I'm still targeting 3500 S&P, which is the distance of that drop we had in 2018.
BULL12|On top of that old top, so we still have about 7% more to get there.
NEUT13|We've already done that in tech.
NEUT14|Had that V recovery, so let's see where we can go, but nothing's changed my opinion.
NEUT15|So you think this is healthy consolidation and a buyable dip, and right now it's not even a dip.
NEUT16|The major averages are actually flat, but one area that has not participated in this.
NEUT17|You know Epic rally that you're talking about here.
NEUT18|Pot stocks, marijuana, cannabis and you're looking to take advantage of that through your trade idea.
NEUT19|Right, these are commodities, so you know that's a big story of the day.
NEUT20|Is the commodities buying now you know eventually those who become regular markets, it will just trade on supply and demand and so forth.
NEUT21|And they're rolling on the ground.
BEAR22|And however you know, Mother Nature treats the crops is going to impact prices, but for right now this is a sector that's been slammed is down 40%.
NEUT23|If you look at the ETF, believe it or not is Yolo.
BEAR24|It's down 40% in the last six months compared to the SP up 10% in the last six months.
NEUT25|So the stock I'm looking at here is.
NEUT26|Kronos Cron it's been trading between 6:00 and 8:00, so that targets $10.
NEUT27|Looking at the in the money option, the $6 calls you have the right to buy it.
NEUT28|At the extreme extreme lows, and that train about 275, so the market right now is at 8:50, so the break even on that option is about $0.25 higher.
NEUT29|An April call that has three months of time?
BEAR30|Well, it's pretty interesting because that chart we were just showing of Kronos certainly looked like it was a bit of a bottom there.
BEAR31|Another sector that's been somewhat beaten down.
NEUT32|Energy skew is low there, so it'll be interesting to watch that one went and see whether or not viable through this.
NEUT33|Earning season Allen Huffman.
BULL34|Thank you for joining us for options, insight from New York.
NEUT35|"This is Bloomberg."""
