NEUT1|So should you invest in Disney stock?
NEUT2|So here's Disney.
NEUT3|Currently is trading for right around $100 per share and I do have a few shares.
NEUT4|I have six of them for an average cost of $82.78.
NEUT5|If we Scroll down here we can see the 52 week low was at $79.07 in the 52 week high was at $153 and 41.
NEUT6|Cents, and they also do offer a small dividend yield of 1.6.
NEUT7|So.
BEAR8|Disney definitely has been hammered pretty hard with the restrictions due to the virus.
BEAR9|If we look at the one year chart here we can see they drastically fell off from their high of one 50s and.
NEUT10|The February early February times.
BEAR11|So they're definitely hitting getting hit really hard with the different theme parks not being able to open.
NEUT12|They do have Disney Plus which is doing well, but that's a very small portion of their business.
BEAR13|So for me personally, at $100, I still think it's a little too much for Disney stock.
BULL14|I do believe in, you know, 234 years they they will come out of it and they'll be doing well.
BEAR15|But at $100 per share right now, it's just still a little too high for me.
NEUT16|With the current situation going on.
BULL17|If it goes below $90.00, I will definitely be a buyer again.
NEUT18|I would like to get some more shares in the.
NEUT19|80 mid 80 range low 80 range would be ideal for me I think just add 100.
NEUT20|It's a little too pricey as of right now for me, so just something to think of.
NEUT21|They let's see Disney stock won't go as high as predicted, but still a buy.
BULL22|I mean, it's definitely still a buy and there's such a large company and they definitely will rebound.
NEUT23|But just at 100 it's a little too much.
