BULL0|"""Hello everybody."
NEUT1|John Layfield here.
BULL2|Hope you've enjoyed follow the axe in our new show we've been downloaded over 2000 cities over 60 countries.
BULL3|All 50 states worked very hard to bring you a good product and if you've been a listener Ora watcher where you get it on Apple, Spotify or YouTube, you know that I've liked Disney stock for some time and if you took my recommendation, you've got a good profit in.
NEUT4|I bought Disney stock when it first got into streaming when it was around 90 to $95.
NEUT5|It's now about $144.
NEUT6|About a $260 billion.
NEUT7|Market cap valuation.
BULL8|Disney to me is the best streaming in the world.
NEUT9|I think Netflix has the best predictive software, meaning you watch the Queen's Gambit all of a sudden, four or five more shows pop up that you might like.
NEUT10|They do that better than anybody else.
NEUT11|Disney though.
NEUT12|Does streaming better you have 10.5 million subscribers on ESPN plus 74 million people on Disney plus a year ago.
NEUT13|They projected that within five years they would have 60 to 90 million subscribers on Disney Plus.
NEUT14|The right in the middle that range after one year.
BEAR15|Now obviously the pandemic greatly compressed.
NEUT16|Time is some of those viewers that we're going to get later, probably in two or three years.
NEUT17|Bought it now because of the shutdown, but you also have 36 million subscribers on Hulu and add to that star India, which has the rights to the Indian Premier League Cricket League.
NEUT18|200,000,000 people watched one regular season game this year.
NEUT19|They have the rights to the over the top Disney's hitting on all cylinders and no one is like Disney.
NEUT20|As far as how you can create.
NEUT21|Something you created either organically or created from an old character like Black Panther and all of a sudden you have this billion dollar franchise around it.
NEUT22|You have a theme park you have themed cruises.
BEAR23|You have merchandise now a lot of that's been shut down because of the pandemic.
BULL24|That's going to come back.
NEUT25|The Disney Cruise Line.
BEAR26|The theme parks which have been shut down this summer.
NEUT27|You're going to have pent up demand.
BULL28|I think those do incredibly well.
NEUT29|I think Disney should be valued at the same as Netflix, about $210 billion just for its streaming service.
NEUT30|Meaning you get the rest of that, ESPN the theme parks the cruise lines, all of that for about $50 billion.
NEUT31|I think Disney could be a double in the next four to five years.
NEUT32|I like Disney stock here.
NEUT33|I've recommended for some time.
NEUT34|"Still do."""
