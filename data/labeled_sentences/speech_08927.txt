BEAR0|"""And I think the media really has been miss portraying Trump's appeal."
NEUT1|It is about the issues.
NEUT2|It's a libel of the voters to say they just want somebody coming along.
NEUT3|You know, being politically incorrect.
NEUT4|It is the issues that both parties have refused to address an most of all the topic of my last book.
NEUT5|Immigration, immigration, immigration, immigration.
NEUT6|Whenever I see you know, these great great names and punditry trying to analyze Donald Trump's appeal always just, you know, search for the word immigration.
NEUT7|If they don't mention that they're lying.
NEUT8|Of course, that's what it is.
BEAR9|Of course, that's what it is and and look at how he's being attacked by both Republicans and Democrats.
NEUT10|Isn't it the economy too?
BEAR11|Though I feel like there are a lot of people who feel like they've been left behind by the political establishment by the rules, the way they've been set up.
NEUT12|An it, you know, it's back to that Clinton campaign from Bill Clinton's campaign.
NEUT13|It's at the economies, yes, absolutely.
NEUT14|But specifically, what about the economy?
NEUT15|It is immigration and the trade deals the bad trade deals.
NEUT16|It's very smart of Trump to be concentrating on the issues that are negotiations.
NEUT17|He's a famous negotiator.
NEUT18|The fact that you know straight out of the bad he starts talking about illegal immigration on the bad trade deals well.
NEUT19|I mean you guys know better than I do.
NEUT20|I care about the cultural issues more, but we've gone from what?
NEUT21|More than 20 million manufacturing jobs in the 80s?
NEUT22|To a little more than 10 million now?
NEUT23|And that's what the population that is grown.
NEUT24|We've just hollow hollowed out the center of America in New York.
BEAR25|I think people really don't know how bad it is out in America and American workers are being replaced by foreign workers being replaced by.
BEAR26|Illegal immigration in many cases, having the jobs washed out and outsourced.
NEUT27|Yeah, the country.
NEUT28|They need jobs they don't need.
NEUT29|Usually the Republican pitches.
NEUT30|You know capital gains cuts great.
NEUT31|I love capital gains cuts, but your family you need to make that up job right?
NEUT32|Yeah, how do you look at his?
NEUT33|How do you look at his business record giving what he'll it?
NEUT34|Not just what Hillary said but actually at his record.
NEUT35|He's created jobs.
BEAR36|But then he's also lost a ton of jobs.
BEAR37|His casinos have historically underperformed.
BEAR38|These have not been great performers over the years.
BEAR39|They have gone bankrupt.
NEUT40|Over the years he hasn't paid everybody back.
BEAR41|Not only not on time, but there are lots of people who have suffered as a result.
NEUT42|How do you?
NEUT43|How do you square all of that?
BEAR44|Well, there have been a lot of businesses and a lot of jobs, and you know, some of them went bankrupt.
BEAR45|The casino business and from what I understand from people who are not Trump and invested in casinos in Atlantic City, there was a lot of political corruption in Atlantic City and it just it's not going to take off a lot of people lost a lot of money there.
NEUT46|But you can.
NEUT47|I mean you can see physical manifestations of his success with Mar-a-lago in Palm Beach or Trump Tower here in New York or Wollman rink.
NEUT48|I mean, if your golf courses, the golf courses that are massively successful, they are, it is.
NEUT49|And not only do I think the successes outweigh the failure, but I like that it's in real estate.
NEUT50|His empire is in America if his empire.
NEUT51|If America goes down, his empire goes down, which is part of what I think drives I mean.
NEUT52|I think it's from the heart.
NEUT53|I really do.
BEAR54|He may have changed his positions on some little things.
NEUT55|Abortion, so on and so forth.
NEUT56|Not that that's a little, but in the grand scheme of becoming president, as far as a brand to an, I mean, you cannot.
NEUT57|Just always Liberty tree oticon.
NEUT58|I think part of that it does come from the fact that it's real estate and not, you know, hedge fund even.
