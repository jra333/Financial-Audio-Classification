NEUT0|"""Hi there, I'm Jason Moser analyst with Motley Fool."
BULL1|One thanks again for joining us for another edition of Ask a fool.
NEUT2|Today's question is submitted to us from Penny Hooks in Penny asks, I've been hearing things about an upcoming stock market crash in total ruin the guy who's predicting this now predict the 08 crash.
NEUT3|The 08 crash.
NEUT4|Is there anything to this, and if So what, if anything, can be done to protect ourselves?
NEUT5|And Penny, I think you've keyed in on something that I think a lot of people are concerned with, and that's all of those those market prognosticators out there.
NEUT6|I believe that you're talking specifically about Marc Faber and his correctly calling the 2008 crash.
NEUT7|And let's be very clear.
NEUT8|Marc Faber is very intelligent.
NEUT9|Individual is a PhD in economics.
NEUT10|He he publishes a report called The Gloom Boom Doom Report, which is an in depth look at markets and economies across the globe.
NEUT11|But by the same token, I think you need to be very careful heating just one individual's predictions, no matter what his track record maybe.
NEUT12|So you have found a great quote from Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett.
NEUT13|It's a quote that I just I love it.
NEUT14|I think it makes a lot of sense and I would advise you to.
NEUT15|To heed this quote and it starts this way, it says if we find a company we like the level of the market will not really impact our decisions, will decide company by company.
NEUT16|We spend essentially no time thinking about macroeconomic factors.
NEUT17|In other words, if someone handed us a prediction by the most revered intellectual on the planet with figures for unemployment or interest rates or whatever, it might be for the next two years, we would not pay any attention to it.
NEUT18|We simply try to focus on businesses that we think we understand.
NEUT19|And where we like the price and management, and that's extremely important to remember these, focusing on businesses and their competitive positions and whether or not it's a good price.
NEUT20|Very foolish.
NEUT21|That's that's a lot of what we try to do here at The Motley Fool as well.
NEUT22|So what can you do as an individual investor?
NEUT23|I think I recommend by looking at some of the the tenants of investing the stock advisor way.
NEUT24|Focus on buying businesses, not tickers.
NEUT25|You're looking to hold these businesses for long periods of time, so make sure you understand the businesses that they have.
BULL26|Long, durable, competitive advantages.
NEUT27|Be lifetime investor.
NEUT28|Look at this over the course of years, decades even.
NEUT29|We're not short term focused here.
NEUT30|Very long term focused.
NEUT31|And if you invest in the good times and the bad, it gives you a chance to enjoy the boom times and also take advantage of better prices during the bad times.
NEUT32|Also, don't forget to diversify.
NEUT33|This can protect you from the inevitable market volatility which we just can't avoid.
NEUT34|And then finally just check your emotions at the door.
NEUT35|Don't get too up or two down any given particular company or or any particular period of time.
NEUT36|Don't let these news releases and predict predictions dictate your investing behavior.
NEUT37|I think if you can follow these these basic tenets of investing the stock advisor way it will.
NEUT38|It will lead you to a lifetime of investing success, so it's a great question.
NEUT39|"Thanks again for asking it and For more information make sure to check out full com."""
