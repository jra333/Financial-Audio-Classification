NEUT0|"""Has claimed this video chart on ticker symbol FCEL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|While moving into Friday from a technical point of view, that is a pretty straightforward chart.
NEUT5|There's two glaring levels that really matter and a lot of people will be watching both these levels, and I make that comment because when a lot of people are all watching the same level and all wondering the same things caught a self filling prophecy caught whatever you want, it can certainly produce some very dynamic movements, and that is exactly what we have with these couple of areas.
NEUT6|So the first level from the resistance standpoint that a lot of people are watching it right with me.
NEUT7|So it's all about that purple line there, which on my chart and notes the very well known, the very famous.
NEUT8|50.
NEUT9|Moving average and why is it famous?
NEUT10|Well, we have a classic example of it stopping the price on Wednesday and then this morning on Thursday, once again stopping the price and not only stopping it then pushing the price back downward.
NEUT11|So the point here being that if there is any sort of recovery back to the upside, you're going to have a whole lot of people watching that purple line and wondering, can the price actually break above it?
NEUT12|And if it can, I mean nothing is guaranteed, but it becomes a valid thought to have that.
BEAR13|OK, if the price does break above that level, that in and of itself could create quite a bit of upwards buying pressure, so we're going to keep a close eye on that purple line like said.
NEUT14|Resistance side of things and on the flip side of the coin, as far as levels of support, a concern.
NEUT15|That's where this green line comes in.
BULL16|Here at $15.70, the price is definitely getting within striking distance.
NEUT17|Hasn't quite, you know hit it yet, but again, nothing is guaranteed.
NEUT18|But same logic.
NEUT19|It's more than valid.
NEUT20|It's more than rational to think that if the price were to come down in this area, behave in that manner and then continue on down.
BEAR21|That that break in and of itself could very well create quite a bit of downward selling pressure.
NEUT22|So you're going to keep a close eye on that area too, but overall very straightforward.
NEUT23|Those are the two main levels to watch moving forward.
NEUT24|So let's see how it all plays out on Friday 1st off.
BULL25|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT27|But it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
NEUT36|Totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
