BULL0|"""Smart move by Apple to sell $7 billion in debt despite having a $200 million cash pile."
BULL1|Yeah, yeah.
NEUT2|They have some debt already on their balance sheet, so I think it makes sense for them to swap out a little of the debt.
NEUT3|I think they had it at four and a quarter before and now they're going to close to three, so that makes a lot of sense.
NEUT4|I I wouldn't extend that to draw too many implications for the stock to Morgan.
NEUT5|I mean apples given its buyback targets and dividend targets based on a net cash target, right?
NEUT6|And so this doesn't change the equation for net cash.
NEUT7|Alright, shares are trading around $212.00 today.
BULL8|They are up almost 2% in this broader market rally.
NEUT9|You got $185 price target.
NEUT10|Why yes?
BULL11|Well, first I think Apple is benefiting today from the China News right?
NEUT12|There is they've traded more with more volatility than most of the China News.
NEUT13|So I think that's what's going on today, I think.
NEUT14|Secondly, I'm a little less optimistic than most.
NEUT15|I think on what multiple we should be paying for Apple here.
NEUT16|Apples five year trading range tends to be in the 13 or 14 times.
BULL17|In some ways it's a better company than it's been because the services mixes richer, but in other ways it's not as good of a company as it's been because it's iPhone user base is is is is not growing as rapidly, so I'm not as willing to extend the multiple that.
BEAR18|We assign Apple two too much beyond its five year range.
NEUT19|Jeff, what about this argument though, that all of the doom and gloom around Apple should be priced in at this point?
BULL20|We know now that Apple can survive Ho Hum replacement cycles.
NEUT21|We know even at this next iPhone cycle, isn't expected to do that much, and that next year we expect to have 5G unless the Apple customer base does the unthinkable and abandons Apple for Samsung just to get a 5G phone when the 5G networks aren't really.
NEUT22|Completely up and running yet.
NEUT23|I mean now is a good time to buy?
NEUT24|What about that argument?
NEUT25|Well, I think the first point I would mention John is that we have to be a little bit careful about that December quarter ahold him.
BULL26|Refresh, I think, is priced in, but I think there's some risk that it's a little bit less than how hung Apple obviously guided up for the September quarter.
NEUT27|Part of that sun wearables.
NEUT28|Part of that is on iPhones.
BEAR29|We suspect both given arts and demand work in our supply work from my colleagues in Asia that some of that is inventory filled and that means that the demand really won't be there.
NEUT30|For the subsequent quarter of the December quarter.
BULL31|"So we think that there could be a whole for the December quarter revenue in iPhones."""
