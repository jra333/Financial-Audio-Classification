NEUT0|"""Haven't we seen a Deutsche Bursa LSE deal before?"
NEUT1|Several times there have been proposals on the table three times since 2000, but all come to nothing.
NEUT2|Don't you person?
NEUT3|Maybe Europe's largest exchange, but it's always acknowledged it needs the magic pull of London, so why should this time be any different?
NEUT4|Well, for stars, the two sides, the eye to eye and that makes a huge change from the past.
NEUT5|This time, the rationale is very different.
NEUT6|The LSE has many assets.
NEUT7|Deutsche Person might like, notably a controlling interest in LCH clarinet, which is a clearinghouse.
NEUT8|Now, this is crucial.
BULL9|The two sides say they can offer banks and hedge funds billions in savings on their trading cost.
NEUT10|By combining their clearing houses.
NEUT11|Could antitrust regulators kill a deal?
NEUT12|It can never be ruled out due to personal better than most.
NEUT13|It's 2012 attempt to merge with Nicer Euronext founded, but the LSE and Deutsche Bursa don't really compete in many areas.
NEUT14|The main area of contention is really derivatives clearing, but incoming rules will require clearing houses to open up.
NEUT15|Now that should in theory, for any attempt to act as a monopoly.
NEUT16|That said, Brussels would examine the deal very carefully and the effects of Brexit.
BULL17|The big unknown if the UK stays in that might seal the deal.
BEAR18|"If the UK leaves well, the departure of one of its most high profile assets would be a symbolic act."""
