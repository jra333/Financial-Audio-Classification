NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, it's Friday March 26th and I'm here to do a quick analysis of ticker symbol F forward to prepare us for Monday morning."
NEUT1|Let's start with today's price action and premarket forbis trading high and above.
NEUT2|The prices we saw yesterday.
BEAR3|But when the market opened the price was rejected by the 12:50 level ending the rally that started yesterday.
BEAR4|The price movement has formed a bearish double top at 12:50.
NEUT5|You can see here.
BEAR6|This indicates that the price will likely stay below 12:50 until it reaches or falls below the previous local minimum price of around 1176.
NEUT7|Now let's zoom out and look at our twenty day 30 minute chart.
BEAR8|The first thing you should notice is that we're trading well below the 200 SMAD.
NEUT9|Additionally, we received confirmation today that the 50 sman is now acting as resistance.
NEUT10|Next, let's go to the daily chart.
BEAR11|My overall impression is that the price will drop again on Monday and go below $12.00 next week.
NEUT12|Most of the indicators that I'm using suggests that this week's Bear Rally will continue until the 50 sman on the daily chart is retested.
NEUT13|This support level is currently around 1170 or 1180.
NEUT14|Let's go back to the 20 day 30 minute chart.
NEUT15|Now before I end this video, I also want to discuss a scenario where the price goes up on Monday based on the indicators that I'm using.
BEAR16|I believe a break above the 200 S Ma here is unlikely.
NEUT17|Let's check out the weekly chart to get some context about the buying volume that would be required for forward to begin a new bull rally on Monday.
NEUT18|Let's check out the weekly chart to get some context about the buying volume that would be required for forward to begin a new bowl rally next Monday.
NEUT19|As you could see, past reversals.
NEUT20|Like the one here, here, here and here.
NEUT21|Have all required at least one an usually two or more weeks of high buying volume.
BEAR22|This week we're closing the week with another red candle and the volume is is pretty low compared to what it has been in the past couple months.
BULL23|So we're going to need to see at least a green weekly candle for me to believe that the correction is ended in a reversal has started.
NEUT24|So that's all for this analysis.
NEUT25|Enjoy your weekend and I'll be back for more technical analysis on Monday.
BULL26|"Thanks for watching."""
