NEUT0|"""Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer have introduced a plan to restrict corporate stock buybacks."
NEUT1|This would be an unprecedented step in the government, basically telling business what they could do with their money.
NEUT2|But is this just political rhetoric, or is there something to this so the whole plan centers around stock buybacks?
NEUT3|And that's essentially when companies take the money they have saved up and use it to buy back shares in the stock market, the result is earnings per share.
NEUT4|The profit a company makes for every share goes up, and that often drives up the stock price.
NEUT5|Democrats want companies to be required to do something for their employees, give them raises, improve their pensions, things like that before they give money back to shareholders, but hold on a moment.
NEUT6|How did we get here?
BEAR7|The political issue which you're going to hear about a ton over the next two years is wages for the middle class have just stagnated for the last 20 years.
NEUT8|The average American family makes around $60,000 a year, and that's roughly the same as it was 20 years ago.
NEUT9|Politicians realize there's a lot of anger about that.
NEUT10|It's one of the reasons Donald Trump was elected, and the Democrats are going to try to use it.
BULL11|To get back into power when Donald Trump took office soon after they had this big tax cut and the major impact of that was corporate profits went up.
BULL12|But also the economy did really well and that drove down the unemployment rate, which helped workers.
BEAR13|One criticism of the Trump tax plan is that the companies used a lot of that money and just bought back stock and so they did not give workers raises necessarily.
NEUT14|And what they did do was buy back shares, drive up the stock price and as everyone knows, the people who own stock.
NEUT15|The biggest owners of stock are rich people.
NEUT16|And so this was seen as a give back to the rich.
NEUT17|While the workers didn't get much, the counter argument is the money that goes to the buybacks, goes to investors, and they reinvest it.
BULL18|And that boost the economy.
NEUT19|Another underlying issue is over the past couple of decades, a big trend is emerged in corporate America.
NEUT20|So companies make revenue, and that revenue is split between profits and wages for employees.
BULL21|And the portion going to profits has gone up a lot.
BEAR22|The share taken by employees has gone down.
NEUT23|So the idea behind the Democrats plan is companies are going to have to give employees something, arrays, better benefits, etc before they can benefit their shareholders.
NEUT24|Now that goes against tradition an you know all the presidents before which is companies basically control the cash they have.
NEUT25|One of the problems with a plan like this is if I'm a company I'm sitting on $10 billion in cash.
NEUT26|Well if there are restrictions on what I'm going to do in terms of a buyback, I'm just not going to buy back the stock.
NEUT27|I'm just going to leave the money sitting.
NEUT28|In my bank account and that doesn't benefit anybody.
BEAR29|The other problem is companies are not going to give workers raises unless they have to, unless the wages for all other industries around them are going up.
NEUT30|I think the Democrats are trying to take a stand that trying to make this an issue in the campaign.
NEUT31|There are more conventional ways to accomplish similar goals, so you can do tax cuts for working class people.
NEUT32|You can raise the minimum wage.
NEUT33|Republican Senator Marco Rubio has a plan out now where they would tax, essentially.
NEUT34|The corporate buybacks.
NEUT35|It would work like a dividend payment where the shareholders would get a bill when the company bought back stock.
NEUT36|So you can do tax cuts for working class people.
NEUT37|You can raise the minimum wage.
NEUT38|Other Republicans will talk about.
BULL39|Well, we need to reduce regulation, increase investment and get the economy growing.
NEUT40|And that's what makes workers earn more money.
NEUT41|The Democrats just control the House of Representatives.
NEUT42|So this bill isn't going anywhere but the rhetoric in the discussion around middle class wages and working class wages is going to be with us for.
NEUT43|"A long time."""
