BEAR0|"""Well, I mean it was going to look rubbish."
BEAR1|We already have forecast from the IMF from the Hong Kong government, is about is had recession.
BULL2|At least one point 3 -- 1.3 growth and for next year about 1%.
NEUT3|This is something that I've been claiming requires a fiscal stimulus.
NEUT4|We have had indeed, and nobody can deny four packages, but they're all very small.
NEUT5|The largest was the first back in August 19 billion.
NEUT6|Hong Kong dollar, not dollar and the latest is 4 billion.
NEUT7|If you think about what has happened in Hong Kong and where we stand.
NEUT8|Overall, something which is actually less than oh point, 75% of GDP looks very small to me.
BULL9|Just remember Japan, Japan just introduced mini mini stimulus of two point half percent of GDP for an economy that is not doing as bad as as Hong Kong.
BULL10|So I do think that that we need more fiscal stimulus.
NEUT11|It's very urgent.
NEUT12|We've tried four times.
NEUT13|I'm sorry it would be nice to try once for all and have a big package.
NEUT14|I realized that the Hong Kong.
BEAR15|Government situation is not easy because land sales are plummeting and that is part of the revenues and that's why we will have the first fiscal deficit for for many years.
BULL16|But fiscal deficits are normal nowadays, and Hong Kong has huge fiscal reserves, which of course they're not going to be tapped into, hopefully which still requires decent fiscal deficit, meaning stimulus beyond a .75% of GDP, no doubt.
BEAR17|So Alicia talk show us about the negative impact of the wealth effect coming from the slump in the Hong Kong stock market as well.
NEUT18|Driven at the fact that it's a driven by domestic factors, you extra actually, you know, zeroed in on this a point in your, you know the recent report in what forms are you seeing?
NEUT19|Or are you?
BEAR20|Do you think we are going to see that negative wealth effect in Hong Kong?
NEUT21|So perhaps one positive side of the story is that what we see so far is mainly consumption.
NEUT22|So its retail sales is hospitality.
BULL23|But the financial sector is still doing pretty well so we have IPO's coming with of course had a big one Alibaba but others come in so the bond market is still working.
NEUT24|Function functioning properly.
NEUT25|The Hong Kong dollars table.
NEUT26|I mean frankly speaking on the financial side, I'm even surprised positively about what's happening in this city given what we see in the streets.
NEUT27|So Hong Kong is very resilient, we shouldn't forget.
NEUT28|But for businesses, especially small businesses, hospitality to remain in the city.
NEUT29|When I I do think they need real fiscal support, real physical support.
NEUT30|This is rent.
NEUT31|This is not only electricity bills and this is basically for the for the retail sector as I mentioned.
NEUT32|Hey everybody, it's Hadley.
