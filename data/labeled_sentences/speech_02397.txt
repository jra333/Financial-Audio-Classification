BULL0|"""Bullish call on Disney."
NEUT1|Let's talk about it.
BULL2|Price target raised New Street High a $175 at city.
BULL3|They talk about continuing momentum in the streaming business.
NEUT4|Go figure.
NEUT5|It's our call of the day.
NEUT6|Farmer Jim Tiffany you own it farmer.
BULL7|You're up 1st 175.
NEUT8|Can Disney get to that level?
BULL9|I think pretty easily it's about to break out to an all time high.
NEUT10|It's right on the cusp of that.
BULL11|This is a great hybrid stock.
NEUT12|What I mean by that it's streaming, so it's got that growth engine, but it's a re open stock with the theme parks and the studios and the broadcast business.
NEUT13|Kind of the best of both worlds doing forward.
NEUT14|I want to leave some room for Tiffany here, but I'll just say this.
NEUT15|It's got basically half the subscriber contact numbers as Netflix, somewhat comparable in terms of market cap, but Netflix doesn't have.
NEUT16|Marvel doesn't have Star Wars, doesn't have 21st Century Fox, etc etc.
NEUT17|There's there's a lot to like about Disney here.
NEUT18|OK, Tiffany, anything you disagree with, yeah?
NEUT19|No, no, I I totally agree with Jim.
NEUT20|And also remember Disney owns owns a portion of Hulu too, so they've got streaming covered all around.
NEUT21|So I definitely like that play again.
NEUT22|You know, just kind of reiterate with Jim said.
NEUT23|Definitely a reopening stock.
NEUT24|They used to rely on.
BULL25|Think about like 30% of the revenue from theme parks, so that's only going to get better as we kind of come through this pandemic.
NEUT26|So I just like it all around.
NEUT27|Last time on the show.
NEUT28|I think I talked about fact that it's a whole new world.
NEUT29|"And it is."""
