NEUT0|"""As we get into October, which is just a few days away, we have to ask ourselves what is the October affect and if you go back in time and I'm talking long time going back into October of 1907 like Thursday, 1929 and then Black Monday of 1987."
NEUT1|They all happen to take place in October in the market, broke on each of those times, but if you really look at September, it has more breaking time in it than October, but people don't talk about that.
NEUT2|We think of the panics that we saw back yesteryear.
NEUT3|There's a perception more than a reality, so would I put any real heavyweight on the fact that we're in October?
NEUT4|Well, statistically, no, I don't.
NEUT5|"I do understand people like to talk about things, but we have much more to worry about than the October effect."""
