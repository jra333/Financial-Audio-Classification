NEUT0|"""You've got, you know, a couple of Democrats who are saying, yeah, let's be careful on the tax side."
NEUT1|They mostly come from blue states Joe Manchin of West Virginia.
NEUT2|He may hold a lot of the cards along with Kristen Cinema.
NEUT3|Do you think the plan as we know it will pass?
BULL4|Well Brian, great to be back with you.
NEUT5|I think you're asking the right question.
NEUT6|So first of all, unlike the Koben 19 package, which pretty much passed as buying proposed it, this is a proposal that is just that.
NEUT7|And so even binds all of his spokespersons have said, look, we want Congress to work this through.
NEUT8|They're going to work closely with them, 'cause they understand that while 80% of American people favor infrastructure, they when you get the detail to get a little tricky.
NEUT9|Especially talk about how you pay for it.
NEUT10|Yeah, corporate taxes.
BEAR11|Now I will say this, Andy, the corporate tax rate proposal 21 to 2821 was brought big time down by Trump.
NEUT12|It won't be 28 will it?
NEUT13|I mean, even if that does pass, you've got certain tax incentive make of America tax credit.
NEUT14|The stuff that I've been reading from smart folks like yourself and others suggest.
NEUT15|That would probably be more like 25 or 26% effective once certain tax credits are thrown back in.
NEUT16|How do you see if this passes Andy?
NEUT17|How do you see?
NEUT18|Sort of the ultimate tax rate playing out?
NEUT19|So I think there are two things here.
NEUT20|I think some definitely Republicans haven't wanted to increase the the corporate tax rate, but some Democrats have said look, I don't really want to go higher than 25% as the as the as the actual rate and then from 25% you can go all the way down to the mid teens.
NEUT21|As far as when companies actually we pay.
NEUT22|So I think right now it's early days really don't know how this is gonna play out.
NEUT23|There's so many moving parts.
NEUT24|Bryan.
NEUT25|As far as how you get this thing passed but you're going to have to navigate the House or the title.
BEAR26|Tardy for the Democrats and you got a 5050 cent, so yes, you're right.
NEUT27|The actual tax rate that that corporations will pay will be much less than 28% ANAN and or 25% whatever the actual rate ends up being.
NEUT28|So you're an Invesco Andy.
NEUT29|How do we invest around this?
NEUT30|If you say well, I don't like it or I love it, whatever it may be, but I want to make money off it.
NEUT31|How do we do that?
NEUT32|So unlike the COVID-19 relief package, which was a huge infusion of cash into the market, over 1 trillion going to be spent by October 1 this fiscal year.
NEUT33|This is a longer term job creation spin, so you gotta think about where that money is going to go.
NEUT34|All the construction that's going to be done all different things and you gotta be on a long term player at this point for the infrastructure build.
NEUT35|There's not gonna be this big boom at the beginning when this thing passes, 'cause the money is not gonna spin that fast.
NEUT36|So we're looking at a longer term value.
NEUT37|Play on that as well as growth.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
