NEUT0|"""My mission is simple to make you money."

NEUT3|May have money starts now.
NEUT4|Hey, I'm Cramer.
NEUT5|Welcome to Mad Money welcome Kramerica would be wanna make friends.
NEUT6|I'm just trying to save you some money.
NEUT7|My job is not just to entertain but dedicate each input days like this in context.
NEUT8|'cause I know you care an are concerned so call me at one 807 four three CBC or tweet me at Jim Cramer.
BEAR9|It was a tough day.
BEAR10|I'm talking about a really tough date mean the average is they were annihilated.
BEAR11|Alright, Dow plummeting 560 points.
NEUT12|92.45%.
BEAR13|And then, as that and so so so so so so so so nosediving 3.52%.
NEUT14|All for one reason.
NEUT15|One reason only interest rates are soaring.
NEUT16|Why?
NEUT17|Because the bond market sees the economy getting ready to reopen.
NEUT18|Yes the vaccine and it figures the last thing we need is more stimulus.
NEUT19|To these bond investors, you know what that's like.
NEUT20|It's like throwing gasoline on the kingsford's.
NEUT21|They think the economy will overheat and what happens then?
BEAR22|We're going to get some serious inflation.
BEAR23|Also, right now we have a Fed Chief Jay Pal, Big Heart who thinks it's nuts to worry about inflation because so many people are out of work as the pandemic, so he doesn't want to raise rates, specially since inflation has been so low for so long.
NEUT24|Hey look, is he looking at lumber doubling?
NEUT25|Like if you want to do that?
NEUT26|OK, Copper 417 maybe?
BULL27|President Biden and his allies in Congress want to pass a huge stimulus package 'cause they want to breathe new life into the economy.
NEUT28|As I see it, powered by doing the right thing, I don't mind a little inflation now and then, but the bond market investors over there thinking.
NEUT29|Are you nuts?
BULL30|The economy is about to start booming, thanks to the vaccines and most consumers are in great shape.
NEUT31|Everyone except the people who don't have a job.
BEAR32|Unfortunately there are a lot of people who don't have jobs.
NEUT33|As a result, investors are selling bonds pushing long term interest rates, higher pushing your mortgage rate higher.
NEUT34|If you have an arm, just check that this morning.
BEAR35|When that happens, stock buyers pull back.
NEUT36|They always do and they pull back hardest on the highest growth stocks.
BEAR37|The ones we like the most in kramerica, but we recognize do get hit in this moment.
NEUT38|And that's what happens.
NEUT39|That's the high price of inflation.
NEUT40|That's what went on today.
NEUT41|Case in point.
BULL42|NVIDIA last night this company reported the strongest quarter I have ever seen from NVIDIA.
NEUT43|This companies become the dominant player in the semiconductor space like Intel was in the 90s.
NEUT44|No one is coming close to them and weather data center.
NEUT45|It is gaming.
BEAR46|It's artificial intelligence, yet the stock got crushed because this is exactly the kind of turbocharged growth story that Wall Street turns against when rates are rising.
BEAR47|Now I think NVIDIA is a victim of short term thinking that people who dumped it here I think are going to be making a mistake including the dump tomorrow.
NEUT48|They haven't thought it through.
