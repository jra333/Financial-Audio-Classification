NEUT0|"""A traders and investors."
NEUT1|It's surg burger here.
NEUT2|Today we're going to have a look at Facebook.
NEUT3|I've been getting a lot of questions about Facebook asking me whether the stock is done going up here for an extended period of time, and I have a very straightforward method of having look at that.
NEUT4|First of all, let's talk about sort of supply and demand.
BULL5|We have a lot of new tech and mobile Internet based businesses coming out in terms of IPO's.
NEUT6|Here in the coming couple of weeks and months, of course today we had Candy Crush come out so we have box coming out in the future if Alabama coming out.
NEUT7|There's a lot of things in the supply in the pipeline and that's going to create natural little bit of distractions away from some of the existing, you know, Internet type of plays new another play social media stocks like Facebook.
BULL8|It's going to take attention away from there, but also it's going to maybe potential.
NEUT9|It'll take a little bit of demand out there.
NEUT10|It's a natural supply and demand demand situation there.
NEUT11|Here very few people talking about that, but I'll tell you, that's basically part of the reason why Facebook is coming a little bit under pressure.
NEUT12|So that lends you know Facebook is doing what it should be doing, which is going a little bit lower at the same time.
NEUT13|If you look at some basics, the basic awesome momentum oscillators and if you don't see this too well.
NEUT14|You know you can just kind of listen to my words, but basically you know more anthem oscillators are good for one thing, but I wouldn't never, ever really basic trade around them solely.
NEUT15|So if you look at the relative strength index, I tend to use them using the version.
NEUT16|So if I see negative divergences, IE price going one way and momentum going the other way in, which is been the case in the RSI since last July, I sit up and take notice at the same time we have to understand that doesn't really work for a lot of these kind of momentum stocks like a Facebook, because there's different dynamics in it at the same time.
NEUT17|At some point we have to take notice, and that's really usually when price or it's a curve down.
NEUT18|So from that point of view, you know there certainly is plenty of room lower in Facebook.
NEUT19|Now the price is actually finally catching up with one moment moment.
BEAR20|There's been telling us for many, many months at the same time stochastics, in near term or immediate term oversold.
NEUT21|So that's good to know.
NEUT22|Again, I would never buy citrate around that, but that's nice to know full right now.
NEUT23|If we go and have a little bit of a closer look at Facebook, we see that one of the great.
NEUT24|Momentum.
NEUT25|Type of indicators in the sense of moving averages that I like to use is the 8 and 21 day moving average.
NEUT26|I talked to my subscribers and direct clients about this every day.
NEUT27|A momentum stock like Facebook that's active that bounce around but is technically a respectable stock, needs more than a 50 or 100 moving average.
NEUT28|So I tend to measure my near term sentiment or momentum in this talk more with eight and 21 day moving average, or at the very.
NEUT29|At the very moment you can see the both of those moving averages pointing down.
NEUT30|In fact, we had the eight they crossed below 21 day here just a few days ago, and from that point of view, there's just really no reason to buy the stock.
NEUT31|If I was long the stock, I certainly would have sold it here.
NEUT32|When that happened a few days ago.
NEUT33|If I want to go in and buy the stock, you know, I just don't see any reason to buy it just yet.
NEUT34|You need price confirmation in stock like Facebook.
NEUT35|If you look at Facebook, even just a couple of months back, there was plenty of opportunities.
NEUT36|Where you didn't have to try to catch a falling knife, you could have gone in and looked for opportunities with this clearly defined candle sticks up gaps.
NEUT37|You know, thing momentum support at various moving averages.
NEUT38|Things like that that I always discuss with my subscribers, so I hope this makes sense.
NEUT39|I don't think Facebook is completely falling apart.
NEUT40|I wouldn't try to catch catch a falling knife just yet though.
BULL41|Hope this makes sense.
NEUT42|Any questions?
