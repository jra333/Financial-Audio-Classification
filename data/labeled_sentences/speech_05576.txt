NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up you guys?"
NEUT1|In this video we're talking about Plug Power, Plug, power, stock, update, technical levels.
NEUT2|I'm watching moving averages, support resistance levels.
NEUT3|Also, we're going to take a look at option market before we get started.
NEUT4|If you could drop a like subscribe to the channel, I would really appreciate that.
NEUT5|$30 thirty $31 level.
BEAR6|That's where it closed on Monday an looks like it's down around 9 1/2% for today.
NEUT7|Zoom out to daily chart if we come here.
NEUT8|That's what we are.
BEAR9|Looking at as a crucial support level, I'm watching $30 level alright and to the upside we could see it's been downtrending.
BEAR10|There's no sign at the moment at this stock may be turning around from here and pushing higher.
NEUT11|Look at this one higher.
BULL12|Higher low.
NEUT13|Lower high, lower low lower high lower low lower high lower low.
NEUT14|So if it makes another low, another level of support I would watch for this name.
NEUT15|Is this trend line this green trend line up here.
BULL16|I would watch it as a support at around these $25 levels.
NEUT17|Not sure if it's going to get there.
NEUT18|I'm going to take a look at the moving averages because it has 5200 day moving average.
NEUT19|This red line right here.
BEAR20|This will act as a support as well, which is sitting around 2650, so that's another level of support for this stock and it's way below its twenty day right here.
NEUT21|The blue line and it's way below its yellow.
NEUT22|This 50 day simple moving average.
NEUT23|Let's have a look at it Magdy what's going on with that?
BEAR24|Maggie is still downtrending.
NEUT25|It's still the spread between signal line and magdeline.
BEAR26|It's pretty big and at the moment selling off with low volume.
BEAR27|Not really crazy panic selling, but it's been coming down.
NEUT28|Also, let's take a look at the options what's happening today.
NEUT29|4064 thousand calls 46,000 puts on Monday, March 29th.
BULL30|An I'm seeing $25 puts pretty big size for May 21st 2500 contracts.
NEUT31|Also $40 put for April 16th.
NEUT32|Also, we're seeing a call for 2022 that's interesting.
NEUT33|Somebody bought almost $800,000 worth of calls for next year.
NEUT34|It's not a short term bet.
NEUT35|OK, that's looking interesting and somebody bought $34 calls an also a lot of other big puts for June.
NEUT36|$35 put April $3532.50 put so according to.
NEUT37|Options so far.
BULL38|Looks like short term market option traders are bearish but long term I'm seeing decent call buying activity for next year.
NEUT39|Say there's one for next year 37 call next year $70.00 call and all the way here next year even $100 call so long term bullish bets coming in but short term people are bearish bets coming in.
NEUT40|So which makes sense?
NEUT41|Short term ultra short term.
NEUT42|It's downtrending, but those are the key support levels I'm watching for this stock, right?
BULL43|Thanks for watching.
NEUT44|I'll see you in the next one.
NEUT45|"Peace."""
