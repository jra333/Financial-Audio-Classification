NEUT0|"""Welcome back, it's the 1st of October 2020, first 850 after week we're in about 12 Litecoin."
NEUT1|What's up Charlie coming in at #12 LTC?
BULL2|Let's go for like one games BDC you know we have been hugging.
BULL3|Support line have been hugging it ever since.
NEUT4|Where was this?
BEAR5|December 2018 year an like one has been a downward trend for many years eighteen 1920 and we still are in a downtrend.
NEUT6|I don't see anything positive about like when you're not at this point of time.
BEAR7|If you see me like potentially, we could still drop lower.
NEUT8|For Litecoin.
NEUT9|Things are very weak for Litecoin and so you must be very careful about going into a trick too soon, right?
BEAR10|I think if Bitcoin drops very likely like one is going to follow Bitcoin dropping as well and we could be crawling.
NEUT11|On the support line you know it could be just crawling all way down on the support line, so be very careful about going to a trade too soon, right?
NEUT12|So we just don't know when like one is going to reverse backup.
NEUT13|Things are very weak so be very very careful about going to trade too soon but but in the bigger scheme of things I think we're gonna squeeze, right?
NEUT14|I think this is a is a BI think we're coming down for a C and we get a D&E and Litecoin is going to go parabolic so your base color takes several years ago in my company in the year 2021.
NEUT15|Traditore two now we're not entirely sure, but you know this is a very very long accumulation.
NEUT16|Multi year accumulation and I think that eventually.
NEUT17|Black line is going to go parabolic.
NEUT18|More likely than not.
NEUT19|Of course.
NEUT20|I could be wrong, but you know, I think one is going to blast off.
BULL21|Alright, let's move on to like win against USD.
NEUT22|But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think.
NEUT23|Like coin in the comments below.
BEAR24|OK so for like one against USD things are not looking good.
NEUT25|Why?
NEUT26|Because there is 8 mountain one mountain two if we drop down we're going to complete mountain #3.
NEUT27|So this is going to be a very high quality descending triangle and I could drop down to the depths of hell.
NEUT28|Yes Sir, they could absolutely happen.
BEAR29|Things are very very weak for Litecoin, very bearish.
NEUT30|Right now, of course things could just start turning bullish just like that, but every time like when breaks above the skinny pink line.
NEUT31|We break breakdown.
BEAR32|We break a little bit towards the top.
NEUT33|We drop down.
BEAR34|Right is a huge drop.
BEAR35|Lisa Corona drop and that's how we broke up above the Scaping client again we're dropping so yeah, and I think that's a Litecoin is forming.
NEUT36|He showed us potentially dangerous slice wanted, but nevertheless it's still head and shoulders.
BULL37|So which means that I think we are in the midst of forming or right shoulder.
BEAR38|I think once the right shoulder is complete problem it could be dropping much, much lower for Litecoin.
NEUT39|Right now we could be hanging around here and I'm pumped.
NEUT40|We drop, or of course things could also start turning bullish as well, right?
NEUT41|Bullish, Bullish case is that we start forming squeeze over here and then pump.
NEUT42|We break towards the upside right?
NEUT43|But at the same time what I see is.
BEAR44|Bearishness, and there's a lot of, uh, stop sales over here.
NEUT45|And if I were to be, will more likely than not pull the price down, eat up all the stops else over here before pushing the price higher.
NEUT46|If I were to be the will.
NEUT47|But things are just not looking good for Litecoin, so be very careful about going into a trip too soon.
NEUT48|I think we probably potentially go up close to the skinny pink line and then we might come back down.
BULL49|Right now it's keeping my essay resistance for Litecoin against USD.
BEAR50|So yeah, like I was saying, things might not look good for Litecoin for awhile and we could be dropping lower.
NEUT51|OK, the ambulance is here, so somebody save Litecoin Charlie.
NEUT52|What you doing?
NEUT53|Yeah, OK alright I guess people my Litecoin technical analysis.
BULL54|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL55|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT56|"I should see you in the next video."""
