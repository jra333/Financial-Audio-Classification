BEAR0|"""Is the market ready for a fall?"
NEUT1|Billionaire?
BULL2|Investor Carl Icahn thinks so and says the feeling played a role in his massive profit.
BULL3|Taking in Netflix in just three years, Netflix shares have risen from about $60.00 a share to Wednesday's closing of more than $678 per share.
NEUT4|An icon pocketed more than $2 billion in the sale of his remaining stake, adding to his estimated net worth of $32 billion, he wrote on Twitter.
NEUT5|He believes his current investment in Apple represents the same opportunity he saw in Netflix several years ago.
BEAR6|But I can also posted an ominous warning to investors on Wednesday tweeting, I believe the market is extremely overheated, especially high yield bonds and if more respected investors had warned about the market in 07, we might have avoided the crisis in 08.
NEUT7|Carl Icahn this year has not made any new big investments that kind of things he's known for.
NEUT8|He hasn't really announced anything big.
BEAR9|He's made a few kind of additions to his investments, but he's been holding back, essentially because he's worried about the market getting a little overvalued.
NEUT10|Mr Icahn certainly is not.
NEUT11|Holding all of his money in his pocket, he is put in some places.
NEUT12|He he's added to his investments in Manitowoc Crane Maker and Gannett, publisher and there he's working with the boards, and they're both actually splitting up those companies.
NEUT13|So that's the kind of stuff he's best known for.
NEUT14|And he is still doing a little bit of that.
NEUT15|But in terms of a new big Carl Icahn stake, we haven't seen one yet.
BEAR16|Other high profile investors seem to agree about the market being overbought.
BEAR17|Both Warren Buffett and hedge fund tycoon Paul Singer have voiced concern about lofty stock prices.
BEAR18|And even Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen sounded an alarm last month telling an IMF audience equity market valuations at this point generally are quite high.
BEAR19|"There are potential dangers there."""
