NEUT0|"""You and I we just said you can't buy something that's not for sale."
NEUT1|You can't also buy something if you can't get a loan, unless you're one of those rare all cash buyers.
NEUT2|Of course.
NEUT3|How is the housing finance market doing right now?
NEUT4|Yeah, so there's two parts, the finance market right?
NEUT5|There's the cost of credit, and there's actually accessing credit.
BEAR6|So in terms of the cost of credit, mortgage rates are at all time lows, so that's very attractive.
BEAR7|But the trick is, can you get the loan lenders since the Chobit crisis started, have tightened lending standards somewhat as they are concerned about the riskiness of some borrowers.
NEUT8|OK, and then what's changed?
NEUT9|Do you?
NEUT10|Do you have to have 20% down?
NEUT11|Can you still buy a house with 10%?
NEUT12|What is going to be altered?
NEUT13|Every business will be altered by what we have gone through and what we're going through today.
NEUT14|What do you think could be more of a permanent change to housing finance that comes from all of this?
NEUT15|I don't think we have any permanent changes.
NEUT16|Right now everybody is just kind of waiting to see how it all plays out.
NEUT17|The really big question is what happens with unemployment?
BEAR18|How many of these jobs that we seeing loss are going to become permanent?
NEUT19|I think we're still going to have all the housing finance programs that we have, if anything.
BEAR20|If there is a significant increase in unemployment, you might see more affordability measures enacted by the GSE's and other government agencies because will probably see rising inequality and more bifurcation in the housing market.
BULL21|So I think in terms of access programs, we're probably going to have the same or expanded access programs.
NEUT22|What's happening right now, though, is for conventional loans you do need, you know, a higher credit score.
NEUT23|You probably need a little bit more money down, but all those access programs that allow people to put maybe 3% down FHA loans and so on and so forth.
BEAR24|Those are also going to be available is just going to be a little bit tougher to get the conventional loans.
NEUT25|You know, we've seen people tap their retirement accounts tendayi to maybe do some home improvements.
NEUT26|Are they tapping their home equity either to do some improvements, or perhaps to just make sure they've got a cash stash ahead of what could be, you know, a long, slow down and sclog yeah, so there's a several parts of the home equity story.
NEUT27|One part of it is, again lending standards.
BEAR28|A lot of lenders have pulled back from home equity.
NEUT29|They don't want to be in that second lien position.
NEUT30|The lenders were doing home equity loans right now would typically do a home equity on somebody who already has a first lien with that same lender, which means that the lender still has recourse to that property if there's a problem with the loan.
BEAR31|What we've seen with home equity is that although volumes are declining, the share of home equity loans that are used for home improvement is actually increased.
NEUT32|So now about half of home equity loans are used for home improvement, whereas back in January it was around 40%.
BULL33|So we've seen an increase in people saying I'm going to use this homework below to improve my house.
NEUT34|"Maybe some people are trying to build those home offices as well."""
