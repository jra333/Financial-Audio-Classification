NEUT0|"""Everyone this Kirk here again from Option Alpha where we show you how to make smarter trades in tonight's video update, I want to go through all the trades, right?"
NEUT1|Say the one trade that we made on Tuesday, August 7th.
NEUT2|So we did get into one new earnings trade and I did send out clarification text, an email on the second one that we're trying to get into.
NEUT3|I said in the trade comments were trying to two new earnings trades.
NEUT4|The other trade that we did try to get into and I would have thought we would have actually filled was an earnings trade in SNAP SNA P, which is Snapchat.
NEUT5|I definitely would've filled.
NEUT6|We tried a couple different prices.
NEUT7|Ultimately, we weren't gonna chase the market.
BEAR8|You know too much lower than where we thought you know.
NEUT9|Decent pricing was and you know, decent trade.
BEAR10|So it seems like other people didn't get filled as well, so I don't know what happened towards the end of the day.
NEUT11|But in either case we only did get into one earnings trade and that was in Disney which had pretty decent implied volatility.
NEUT12|So Ivy rank was around 76.
NEUT13|So pretty decent implied volatility for Disney went ahead and sold the very wide iron butterfly for Disney, so centering the trade of 117, which is about where the stock closed today expected move was about $4.00.
NEUT14|So you can see our credit that we took in here was just beyond that.
NEUT15|Expect to move.
BULL16|So we took in a credit that moves us out to around the 6870% probability of success on this trade.
NEUT17|Now, Disney was an interesting one, because when you look at the chart today, Disney had a huge run up the last two days and even earlier today on all this new TV media stuff that came out which I just like basically caught the headlines of.
NEUT18|But basically I guess Disney was a part of it or their investing in it.
NEUT19|I still don't even know what the deal is that, nor does it matter, but this is probably a classic example of by the rumor sell the news type event.
BULL20|Where I think people were anticipating that Disney was going to have amazing earnings and maybe it did, but it was and I guess meeting up to expectations of what Wall Street really expected the stock to do.
BEAR21|So right now we can see after hours, Disney did announce their earnings or down about $0.62 or so and after hours trading.
BULL22|But ultimately it's good for us.
NEUT23|Our position with center 117.
NEUT24|So as long as Disney stays and opens in this range we should make about $300 profit on this trade.
BULL25|So nice quick earnings trade.
BULL26|And it should work out pretty nicely.
BEAR27|Again, we trade the weekly contracts expected move was about $4 ish.
BULL28|We sold the inside strikes at 1:17 and then went all the way out on either end and bought protection out of 107 and 126 making this a very even imbalanced earning straight heading into tomorrow's open.
NEUT29|So we'll see where things go tomorrow again.
NEUT30|Quick video update, but I want to get this one out.
NEUT31|You guys.
NEUT32|You know we did.
NEUT33|As always, if you have any questions let me know.
NEUT34|"And until next time happy trading."""
