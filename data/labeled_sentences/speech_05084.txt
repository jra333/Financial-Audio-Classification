NEUT0|"""Hey, in this episode of fun with charts and take a look at Netflix Square and video."
NEUT1|So first up we have Netflix and we've already looked at the long multi year trend that we're paying attention to down here, and one interesting trend that's trying to form is this.
BEAR2|Downward trend right here.
NEUT3|That's trying to form.
NEUT4|And one reason why this is interesting is that in the past this has happened several times.
NEUT5|And what can we learn from it?
BULL6|Well, here once we broke the trend, we had a modest gain of about almost 4% here.
BULL7|But if we go and jump ahead here, the next time it a Kurd, we had a gain of a little over 8% from this trend being broken to up here and then the next time it happens.
BULL8|We have a gain from this point here.
NEUT9|Once it breaks this trend of about.
NEUT10|9% here from from this line up here and then again we have it happened one last time right here in this downtrend and this game.
NEUT11|As of about 9%.
NEUT12|Well, we do have another over arcing trend that's occurring this whole time that.
NEUT13|This is actually a 30 from from this point.
NEUT14|Here to appear is about 32% gain, but if we just take these 4 results here, the average is an 8% gain.
NEUT15|Which actually happens to be about this bounds right here.
BEAR16|This is about 8.2 or a little over 8% from here to here, so we could see that this can obviously go down further, but once this breaks the trend on average we can see an 8% correction from these historical scenarios.
NEUT17|And so the interesting thing there is that the down side, at least in the near term, this is a support line right here.
BULL18|I would expect to see it bounce if we do hit this.
NEUT19|If this is going to turn into something like this, we would probably go through it.
NEUT20|If it's going to keep going down, but I'm interested to see when this breaks out.
NEUT21|That could be an interesting swing right there.
NEUT22|OK, now jumping on to their next stock.
NEUT23|If we look at square 0, there's interesting channel that's happening here.
NEUT24|Well, actually it's a.
BULL25|Sending triangle I could see a nice bounce, so I'm definitely keeping my eye on square stock here.
NEUT26|This is a long term support that this trend has been giving us and then now let's look at video.
NEUT27|NVIDIA has almost a basically a descending triangle going on here, but interesting thing that we can look at here is that this trend line down here will probably provide a nice support and give us a nice bounce and these trends right now.
NEUT28|Just give us a window by and when to sell until it breaks either way and we are getting closer to the apex here, so I would expect to move sometime in October or November out of this trend.
NEUT29|By hope you had fun with fun with charts and friendly reminder.
