NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys, it's your boy will back another video today."
NEUT1|I will be talking about AMC stock ticker, symbol AMC and I'll be giving you guys my AMC stock analyst ANSI stock predictions and also some levels so.
BEAR2|And we all know they are pushing this price down, which *****.
NEUT3|'cause it kind of like like Robinhood just stopped you from trading.
BEAR4|Which isn't fair at all, but seems like they are just pushing the price down very strongly.
BULL5|It was all the way up at $16.00 a day before and it went all the way down to $6.
NEUT6|If it would hit this level right here at $5.16.
NEUT7|I would have bought around 100 shares if it would've hit that level.
BEAR8|It got close, the low is $6 and I had to level F 516.
NEUT9|So if I was watching it, I probably would have bought when it got a little close to it because it shot right up to almost $9, so that would have been.
NEUT10|That would have been about a 40% return.
NEUT11|Which would have been good for me?
NEUT12|But I kind of missed that, so I'm looking at it for tomorrow.
NEUT13|If I play this talk, it'll be just playing short term for quick bounces like this.
NEUT14|This is what I want to be playing.
NEUT15|I won't be holding any long term because I don't.
NEUT16|It's kind of uncertain of what is going to happen with this stock and also with the GameStop.
NEUT17|I mean GameStop stock so it's very uncertain, very risky.
BEAR18|Even these levels might not work and then like I said, if it broke above the $17.00 figures then AMC would have went to the moon, but it's nowhere near that level at all.
NEUT19|It's more down here.
NEUT20|So right now we're just playing it by ear.
NEUT21|I'm trying to see what are these hedge funds and institutional are trying to do because I've been hearing that this is like a fake push down to get you out of the stock, but it hasn't made any really run up.
NEUT22|It's kind of just been trading in this range.
NEUT23|If you can kind of see that between 17 and like 6 it's just been trading in this range.
NEUT24|So.
NEUT25|For me to really just confirm that it wants to start going higher, I would like you to go both 17.
NEUT26|I know that's a big range, but that's just how it's just a safer side in my eyes or how I want to play it an if it breaks this level then I probably just won't be playing the stock at all.
NEUT27|I really need to see if it if it wants some movement 'cause I think a lot of people probably sold out out of their play.
NEUT28|On AMC.
NEUT29|But we will see I'll keep making updates every day as I see fit an I am looking for a quick entry play like this, right?
NEUT30|That's what I'm looking for to play AMC 'cause it's very volatile an whenever has quick drops.
NEUT31|It usually has this little quick pop up.
NEUT32|OK, so that's why I'm playing AMC.
NEUT33|I'm watching both of these levels and I'll keep you guys updated.
