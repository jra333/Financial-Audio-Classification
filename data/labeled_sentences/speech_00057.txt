NEUT0|"""What's up ****** *******?"
NEUT1|Today I would like to discuss today's market performance of Neo.
NEUT2|Lately, holding Neo stock has been almost as boring as watching paint dry.
BEAR3|After a modest sell off from the $50 range to the low 30s and now back up into the mid $40 range, the price has remained rather stagnant.
BULL4|This stock seems to have found a strong support level here at the $42 area.
BEAR5|Volume has been incredibly low, leading to less volatility as it is being strongly held.
BEAR6|However, without enough buying or selling, the price will sit still as it has been throughout this week.
NEUT7|You see, boomers do not seem to understand the value of electric vehicles.
BEAR8|This month we have seen losses throughout the entire EV sector.
BEAR9|Among other stocks, Tesla in particular has seen a large sell off in recent weeks.
BEAR10|But that's mostly due to their faulty autonomous driving feature crashing their cars.
NEUT11|If you own an autonomous vehicle, never trust it 100%.
BEAR12|That is dumb.
NEUT13|You should always be prepared to intervene when necessary, rather than sleeping at the wheel hoping to wake up at your destination.
NEUT14|Just like how you should not listen to anything, I tell you about the stock market or consider anything I say to be financial advice.
NEUT15|Anyway, Cathy Wood is very bullish on Neo moving into the next few years with a price target of $300.
NEUT16|Whenever Mommy tells me to buy a stock, I do it.
BULL17|I intend to add to my Neo position if we see another dip into the $30 range, although it has been holding very strong at 42.
BULL18|I believe this stock to be worth a minimum of $50 and is currently undervalued, but that means now is a good time to buy.
NEUT19|Or at least that's what I think based off of my minimal understanding of technical analysis.
BULL20|I am bullish on Neo and I like this stock a lot.
NEUT21|However, I consider this to be a long term investment rather than a short term play.
NEUT22|"Again, this is not financial advice, and if you make financial decisions based on anything that I say, then you are indeed a **** ***."""
