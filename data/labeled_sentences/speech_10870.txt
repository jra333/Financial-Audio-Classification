NEUT0|"""OK, for all you OTC lovers out there."
NEUT1|I got a tip from friend, longtime friend of the channel Reno, about an OTC stock that is a solar generation play and it is very, very cheap.
NEUT2|Let's talk about it real quick and bring it to you before the market opens.
NEUT3|Let's go hunting, hunting for monsters.
NEUT4|Good morning friends.
BULL5|I hope you and your loved ones are doing well.
BULL6|Hope you're off to a great start for your day.
NEUT7|Discord Link is on your screen.
NEUT8|We will fill it.
NEUT9|Link down below.
NEUT10|This will be a quick video, you know I told you all that I've always tried to bring you stocks and I think you found value in that.
NEUT11|Can you know double your money?
NEUT12|Remember though, modifying supervisor.
NEUT13|Please do your own due diligence.
NEUT14|These are my opinions only if you like the stock feature here maybe available cheaper price really.
NEUT15|Quick stock ticker, MMX.
NEUT16|Is 1 penny.
NEUT17|I know you've OTC levels are going to love that.
NEUT18|The ticker is for MX Resource Group or Corporation.
NEUT19|They are int acquisitions and development and financials for oil, gas.
NEUT20|Or I'm sorry acquisitions development and financing for the oil and gas refineries and infrastructure in Texas and South America.
NEUT21|They are working to develop solar energy to power multiple projects.
NEUT22|The CEO, Jack Hanks declared the company is modifying their business plan to include clean energy use and production clean energy production so, and according to the report in the news tab here and Yahoo planning multiple solar generation projects.
NEUT23|So we have a company who wants to work on generating solar power and they're going to do it through multiple projects.
NEUT24|They're already in Texas or South America.
NEUT25|And the stock is for available for a penny and yesterday had a big run.
NEUT26|But when we're talking about generating solar power, just like with SIRC and some of the other calls I've made, that's a hot sector right now.
NEUT27|So to think that it's only a penny, I know interest many of you you know.
NEUT28|So again, when I see these plays, you know, get excited because I know that there's opportunity here in this stock.
NEUT29|Go to $0.10.
BULL30|Absolutely big play and like to thank Reno for bringing that to our attention.
NEUT31|He's a good guy who always likes to just.
NEUT32|You know work on finding stocks that are undervalued and just like everybody who's in the discord were over 3000 strong, now you can jump in there and learn a lot from a lot of different investors.
BULL33|So thank you, Reno for bringing this to our attention and I hope that it helps somebody today.

NEUT35|I believe it will see it be run from this already today.
