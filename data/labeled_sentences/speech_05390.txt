NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol NVDA."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT2|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT3|In case maybe new charts.
NEUT4|I do offer a quick explanation video if you're unsure so you can go there and I'll explain in detail and then also from a disclosure standpoint I do own NVIDIA in my retirement portfolio so just keep that in mind.
NEUT5|Well, I don't mean to state the obvious, but I'm going to anyways.
NEUT6|Very nice movement today, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day so that eyeballs on this one.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support.
NEUT8|And then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT9|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim.
NEUT10|What makes this chart like the absolute strongest going forward?
NEUT11|And that would be if the price can say above 202, fifty.
NEUT12|With that being said, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that if the price falls below 202 fifty, that means the entire charts destroyed or anything like that.
BULL13|But yeah, if the price could actually stay above there, that would be a very very solid sign of consolidation and just overall health for the chart.
NEUT14|Now taking a step back and look at things from a bit bigger picture time frame.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving, moving meaning as next week plays out.
NEUT18|That line is going to continue to move itself higher and higher, so a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT19|That right there is how I am defining the move.
NEUT20|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT21|The Bulls are in full control having best visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT22|Yeah, staying above 202 fifty would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple lion, the Bulls 100%.
NEUT23|Own the chart.
NEUT24|What about levels of resistance moving forward in the very near term?
NEUT25|That initial level is going to be where the party just got rejected several times today and that's it's right up at the 205 round Number.
NEUT26|So 205 that near term level.
NEUT27|If the price can push up through there, then let's go to the daily timeframe an I didn't realize that it hides that haven't been seen for a very long time.
NEUT28|So oh wow.
BULL29|Well done NVIDIA.
BULL30|So alright so 205 if the price can break up through there.
NEUT31|The next key overarching level.
NEUT32|Keep an eye on right up there around 209 fifty so 205.
NEUT33|209 fifty next couple of key Battlegrounds going forward but yeah.
BULL34|Very very nice movement for NVIDIA lately.
NEUT35|And I mean I knew it was going well, but I didn't realize that you know this is pressing highs that haven't been seen for.
NEUT36|As you saw, there are multiple months but on all nice way to end the week and we'll see if the Bulls can build up on this momentum or not next week.
NEUT37|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT38|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL40|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird.
NEUT42|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT43|But in a cruel way.
BEAR44|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT47|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT48|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
