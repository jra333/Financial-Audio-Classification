NEUT0|"""Let's say you're a small investor."
NEUT1|Yes, you and let's say you're looking for ways to put your money into stocks and bonds.
NEUT2|Here are two good options to consider mutual funds, and they're investing cousins, exchange traded funds known as ETF's.
NEUT3|Both are baskets of stocks picked by a professional mutual funds set.
NEUT4|Their price once a day and are overseen by fund managers, ETF's, trade all day on an exchange.
NEUT5|So they're basically mutual funds that trade like stocks, making it easier to move in and out of them.
NEUT6|ETF's rarely change because they mirror an index like the S&P 500, which is a diverse group of 500 stocks.
NEUT7|Everything from American Airlines to Facebook to Nike.
NEUT8|So when the S&P goes up, so will your ETF and vice versa.
NEUT9|On the other hand, mutual funds are usually actively managed, so the baskets might change frequently as a manager buys and sells stocks in specific areas like emerging markets or tech, you can buy mutual funds through a broker, a financial advisor, or directly from a fund company.
NEUT10|ETF shares can be purchased on an exchange, like the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange, which is right for you.
NEUT11|Yes, you.
NEUT12|Most people stick with mutual funds.
NEUT13|The money in your 401K retirement plan is put into mutual funds.
NEUT14|There is $13 trillion invested in mutual funds and some 2 trillion in ETF's.
NEUT15|But they're growing ETF's put more responsibility on you, the investor, to decide when to buy and sell.
NEUT16|Since you're a do it yourself or you'll pay a lot less in fees.
BULL17|That flexibility can help with taxes.
NEUT18|Since you have control over when to book gains and losses, bottom line both are good options.
NEUT19|"It really depends on you."""
