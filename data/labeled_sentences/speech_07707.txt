BEAR0|"""Hello everyone kept him here in this video."
NEUT1|I want to get into tomorrow's hearing report for Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett and why it's extremely important and we'll get into some technical analysis on Berkshire Hathaway as well.
NEUT2|Also, if you like 3 free stocks, went four Wheeling rabbeted.
NEUT3|Check the links in description below.
NEUT4|So guys tomorrow Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are basically reporting earnings for the company and the reason that this is really important right now is because we're going to get to see all of Berkshire Hathaway's cash pile which was sitting at about $130 billion the last time we had information.
BEAR5|And we're going to see what happened to that cash pile during the market crash in mid March, where we had a market bottom.
NEUT6|I think around March 18th, so we're going to be able to see right now through how much cash they have if they spent any money buying stocks, or in general, what's going on with their current buying an acquisition property.
NEUT7|So right now, Berkshire is going to release their earnings tomorrow, and this is going to be huge information for us as investors.
NEUT8|Now we're not going to know exactly what stocks they bought, but we'll figure that out by May 15 because May 15.
NEUT9|They also have to release another report.
NEUT10|Showing their portfolio and what they have in it, so that's also great you so keep an eye for that, because that's also going to be very huge news based off of what Warren Buffett has been wanting to invest in during this market crash.
BEAR11|Now we know Warren Buffett during this market crash has been more quiet, more conservative, and this might be because he truly is fearful right now because he doesn't know what's going to happen in the future due to this pandemic.
NEUT12|But one thing we have to remember is, Warren Buffett is probably known for his statement of buying when everyone is fearful and there could have been a lot of buying done by Berkshire.
NEUT13|In March, so that's why we're going to have all of their cash reserves up until March reported.
BEAR14|So if we do see a significant decrease in this, that can definitely signify that Berkshire has been spending money in some of these companies.
NEUT15|Now, what companies could they possibly be?
NEUT16|Who knows, maybe JP Morgan?
NEUT17|That's one of Warren Buffett's favorite.
NEUT18|Maybe they went, he went more into Apple.
NEUT19|We know that that's been one of his more favorite investments as well.
NEUT20|Maybe who knows increases stake in Bank of America?
NEUT21|We don't know.
NEUT22|But one thing that might be key is he might be buying a very American based companies.
NEUT23|Because that's been his strategy in the past as well.
NEUT24|In 2008 he said focus on American stocks, and that's basically what he was buying.
NEUT25|So I think that trend won't change.
NEUT26|But overall we're going to be able to see exactly how much was spent, and this will help us gauge Warren Buffett's confidence in the current market.
NEUT27|Now getting into some Berkshire Hathaway technical analysis.
BEAR28|So guys, I had drawn this charts off for awhile now, and we see here we got rejected by this .5 Fibonacci line and this 50 exponential moving average.
BEAR29|And ever since we've been kind of trending lower.
BULL30|It kind of broke the recent support line over here, so currently I think Berkshire will retest to this level over here.
NEUT31|And here's where we might find support now tomorrow.
BEAR32|If earnings are bearish 'cause we know that Berkshire stock in general has fallen more than the S&P 500 has rebounded.
BEAR33|So I think Berkshire Hathaway up until now is down 9% while the S&P is down a few percentage points since the breakdown.
BEAR34|So Berkshire Hathaway stock has performed less than the S&P 500.
NEUT35|But again, we'll find out in earnings tomorrow if they beat estimates or not, and that might be a catalyst.
BULL36|Drivers like higher on Monday.
NEUT37|But we might not know for a fact if this will generate more upside movement in Berkshire Hathaway stock.
NEUT38|So we're currently under this 20 expansion.
BULL39|Moving average again, guys looking bearish.
BEAR40|This is kind of a bearish pattern over here.
BULL41|If we do find support, it'll probably be in this area and again tight stop losses.
NEUT42|If you guys would take a trade, there's no financial advisor on my own opinions, but this would be a tight stop loss area.
