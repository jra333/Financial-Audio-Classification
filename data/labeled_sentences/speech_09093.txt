BULL0|"""Hey, what's up everybody welcome external."
NEUT1|We're going to analyze the stock beyond meat and that squeak and see right here.
NEUT2|This is stuff that never really found the trend.
NEUT3|OK, it had huge movements up and down, but never really found a trend.
NEUT4|So what is beyond me doing right now?
NEUT5|OK, let's go to the daily charts.
NEUT6|And let's take a look at what he's doing so we can see that we have here.
NEUT7|Destroyed, we have apparel channel that the that beyond meat has been doing since since March 2020.
BEAR8|You can see that the price founder resistance right here need to $120.00 worth the price touched the upper side of the channel and it went down so that day the price price gave us a very bad very bad counter.
NEUT9|OK we can see right here this red candle.
NEUT10|The future scandals about signal.
NEUT11|OK, the price.
NEUT12|It didn't even struggle a little bit with the with the upper side of the channel.
BEAR13|It just went down in the price.
NEUT14|Open there and it went all the way down so we can see that now the price is trying to fill the gap that it left.
NEUT15|That day so I can speak the price to try to visit the the lower side of the channel.
NEUT16|OK.
BEAR17|However, if we see the price are active here in the 200 moving average, it could give us a signal that the price is trying to do go up again.
NEUT18|So this is an important level right now where we have the different moving average because this as well where we have this $140.00 range that we have seen that this level worked as a support and as a resistance in the past.
NEUT19|We can see right here.
NEUT20|OK, we can see that it worked as as as a resistance were here in December.
NEUT21|Has a resistance requiring also into any on in several occasions.
NEUT22|OK, this is an important area between the $130 thirty, $50 and $140.00.
NEUT23|So let's see what the price does.
NEUT24|If it eventually goes there.
NEUT25|So another level levels to watch.
NEUT26|If we draw the fever Nachi levels right here of all these these movements since March 2020, we can see that the.
NEUT27|61.8 level is right here.
BULL28|Exactly in the $113 where the price found support in the lower side of the channel in Generation 21.
NEUT29|Aren't unimportant level to watch, would be, of course yes the 38.2 but as well the 50% because the price could meet this 50% in the lower side of the channel and this could be an important range that could make the price react upward because these areas as well the the support and resistance that we mentioned before.
NEUT30|Important levels of 130 five $140.00.
NEUT31|So if we assume in a little bit we go to the hourly chart.
BEAR32|You can see that the price is currently struggling.
NEUT33|We did 200 moving average to the hourly one.
NEUT34|So let's see if the price reacts there.
BULL35|Let's see if the price is able to find the support there and make its way back up again.
NEUT36|But as it looks right now, I believe that the price could visit the lower side of the channel.
BULL37|I could try to find support in this $145.00.
NEUT38|"Alright, so thank you very for watching if you like it, please subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for more videos."""
