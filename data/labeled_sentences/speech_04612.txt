NEUT0|"""Want to talk about the emerging markets, smart homes and I want to start with the hub of this smart home smart speakers."
NEUT1|Does Amazon Price the Echo device below cost?
NEUT2|It's not.
NEUT3|It's list price, but it's often on promotion and sometimes when it's on promotion it may be below cost.
NEUT4|Yes.
BEAR5|Well, several other companies did tell us, in fact that Amazon is pricing echo devices way below cost, making it nearly impossible for them to compete.
BULL6|And aggressively discounting Alexa enabled speakers as a strategy to own the smart home.
NEUT7|Like many markets, we've heard about today's smart speakers with voice assistants like Alexa, along with the myriad of smart home appliances that Alexa can interact with, make up the next ecosystem or platform for tech companies to lock in customers.
NEUT8|Would you say this smart home market for which the Echo Ring, security system and other smart devices operate is a winners?
NEUT9|Take all market yes or no?
NEUT10|No, I wouldn't.
NEUT11|Especially if we were able to succeed about, we want, which is.
NEUT12|We would like our our vision for this is that smart home speakers should answer to different wake words.
BULL13|So when considering the acquisition of Root case by case basis and I think in that just to support if we could achieve that, then I think you would get really good behavior on the part of you know competitive voice agents helping you when you were looking at acquiring ring you wrote to your executive team quote.
NEUT14|We're buying market position, not technology.
BULL15|And that market position and momentum is very valuable.
NEUT16|So if smart homes are not a market with locking affects, why would a leading market position in momentum be so very valuable?
NEUT17|Sir market position is is valuable in almost any business and it's one of the primary things that one would look at in an acquisition.
NEUT18|There are multiple reasons that we might buy a company.
NEUT19|Sometimes we're trying to buy some technology or some IP.
NEUT20|Sometimes we're to talent acquisition, but the most common cases market position that the company has traction with customers.
NEUT21|They've built a service.
NEUT22|Maybe they were the first mover or convenient number of reasons why they have that market position.
NEUT23|But that's a very common reason to acquire a company.
NEUT24|Well, once a company becomes dominant in a market, it can favor its own products and services.
NEUT25|Alexa enabled smart speakers make up over 60% of the smart speaker market Mr Basis when I ask Alexa to play my favorite song.
NEUT26|Prime Music is the default music player, is that right?
NEUT27|"If you're, I think that's true if you're a prime member, yes."""
