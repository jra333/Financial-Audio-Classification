BULL6|It's a great opportunity and we'd love to have you.
NEUT7|Or to take a look at this Facebook Daily chart here.
BULL8|As you can see, it's running up against this 102 seventy 102 fifty resistance right here.
BEAR9|Overall is a very bearish move right here that Facebook made last week.
BULL10|OK, we had a break out to new all time highs and then we failed hard.
NEUT11|OK now it doesn't matter what the rest of the market does.
NEUT12|All that matters is that Facebook failed hard.
BULL13|It broke out to new all time highs and then it failed hard.
BEAR14|So that is a failed breakout.
NEUT15|OK, now notice the difference.
BULL16|You say that you know Facebook broke out to new all time highs here and then.
BEAR17|We consolidated lower and then we crashed here and then we bounced again.
NEUT18|OK now the difference between these two moves between this time and this time that we came back down is that.
NEUT19|Is the speed at which the move took place?
BULL20|OK, so right here we had a break out to new all time highs.
NEUT21|And then just three days later we come crashing down, alright?
NEUT22|So over here it took a lot of time.
BULL23|We made new all time highs and then we kind of consolidated, consolidated, consolidated and then we came back down OK.
BEAR24|This is a clear rejection of these new prices up here.
NEUT25|OK, so at the very least, I would be cautious on the long side because of this failed breakout.
NEUT26|Here we've got this first resistance at 102.
NEUT27|Seventy next resistance, which I believe if it gets up here, it won't break any higher than that.
NEUT28|If it does, I would not be holding on to any shorts above that 108 level.
BULL29|OK, so that one away level I believe is a good shorting opportunity.
NEUT30|If it breaks over that.
NEUT31|I don't think shorting Facebook would be a good idea.
BULL32|Right guys, thanks for watching that video.
BULL33|Really appreciate you guys stopping by.
BULL34|Hopefully this video will bring you some profitable trades in the future.
