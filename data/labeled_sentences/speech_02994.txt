NEUT0|"""Procedures were looking at Facebook that they also have earnings coming out this week."
NEUT1|Will see on how that could potentially affect it with again a lot of stuff on the headwinds, especially on Facebook.
BULL2|We got some of a strong pullback.
NEUT3|Let's look at the chart here again, looking here on the DAND stands for daily, not for something else.
NEUT4|Facebook again has been has seen that $300 range, but has been been bouncing around here.
BEAR5|Then got a really sharp correction here, but bouncing off very well here off that 200 DMA which is that Teal line here basically around 2:50 here.
BULL6|If that can that V shape recovery look beautiful V there like that is a very strong bounce, but we jump right into resistance here, which we previously seen around that 275 range, again with earnings on the horizon.
BULL7|Could this potentially get a boost higher up to the 300 to 290 range?
NEUT8|Or could we see it back down to 250?
BULL9|Definitely, earnings is a coin flip in my book, so definitely one to watch, but there is some strength and the Bulls are trying to help this one push higher.
NEUT10|"Alright peace."""
