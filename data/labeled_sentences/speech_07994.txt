BULL0|"""Tremendous top line guidance for the year out of Lululemon and certainly demand across their product remains incredibly high, I think."
BEAR1|Analysts had to take their earnings estimates down for this year related to some significant estimated investments related to mirror their SG and a dollars will be up over $470 million this year.
NEUT2|Much of that is related to mirror.
BEAR3|Mirror is 3 to 5% dilutive to earnings this year, so a lot of costs related to mirror mirrors in a competitive market at Home Fitness with Peloton.
NEUT4|Apple Nike Training club.
NEUT5|So they have to invest compete.
NEUT6|And that is.
BEAR7|That's pretty significant to takedown earnings.
NEUT8|That much for mirror, representing right now, only 5% of revenue.
BULL9|I know that they have big expectations for revenue growth to be up as much as 65% this year, but do you think that's the right place to put the investment as it's such a small part of the business right now?
NEUT10|Play Calvin and the team there are see a huge opportunity with at Home Fitness an I think you know they spend $500 million to buy the platform.
NEUT11|Now the time is to scale it.
BULL12|Lulu generates the highest return on capital of any company in softlines retail.
NEUT13|We think they'll get this right, but it will take a lot of investments to scale.

NEUT19|Well, she was canals transitory.
NEUT20|I think you'll you'll hear.
BEAR21|We just got done with our Q4 earnings calls and I think when you go into April May and you start to hear from companies on Q1, you're going to hear a port congestion.
BULL22|You're going to hear a better traffic in retail.
BULL23|I think the narrative around the whole sector will continue to improve.
BEAR24|I think much of the port congestion in LA and the Suez Canal is transitory.
NEUT25|The bigger issue is actually cost headwinds on film, inside which are more secular related to last mile so?
BULL26|Port congestion, better traffic.
NEUT27|A lot of stimulus falling through the economy is going to be a very good spring or retail.
NEUT28|And very quickly here, I know you have a pretty big coverage universe.
NEUT29|What would be your top picks as you think about a strong spring for retail?
BULL30|Yeah, sure, there's been obviously the big shift from growth into value market wide, and we're seeing that in retail, and that's really been one of the reasons why retail has been one of the best performing sectors in the market.
NEUT31|I think we're looking to play she free cash flow multiple stories **** ****** Sporting Goods Foot Locker, off Price retail.
NEUT32|These will all benefit from re opening.
