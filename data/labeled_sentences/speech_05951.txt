BULL0|"""Obviously I know this is huge news for a firm."
NEUT1|How exactly will this partnership work?
NEUT2|So sometime before the end of the year, and certainly before Black Friday and all the important retail dates, eight will be calm, exceedingly easy for any retailer on the traffic platform to basically flip a switch and say I would like to offer a firm as the champ.
NEUT3|I pay installments powered by firm to give his full name.
BULL4|Just turn it on and start seeing increase sales.
NEUT5|Shopify has more than 1,000,000 merchants.
NEUT6|How big a deal is this for a firm in terms of.
NEUT7|The activity in the business that it will drive on your platform.
BULL8|It's massive, it's a giant leap for us towards basically totally ibiquity.
NEUT9|Shopify has served as you said, over a million merchants and millions and millions of consumers and.
NEUT10|This is the moment where our product becomes available to all of them all at the same time, and so it's obviously giant.
NEUT11|No better way to put it.
BULL12|I think we have just one the biopsy later race, but you know, we need to deliver on our promise.
NEUT13|So who's in that race?
NEUT14|Talk about the competition and you know what it'll take to really win.
NEUT15|Yet.
NEUT16|Fundamentally, we're all competing with credit cards.
NEUT17|The company wasn't founded to be the best of a nitche interesting payment.
NEUT18|Idea it's.
BULL19|The fundamental notion here is to provide a better, more honest, more transparent alternative to credit cards to consumers and so.
NEUT20|We compete with revolving credits.
NEUT21|That's that's what we're all here to do.
BULL22|The goal is to be as ubiquitous credit cards and provide a better lower cost, high quality, fundamentally more trustworthy service.
NEUT23|And that's really what the races.
NEUT24|Now, when I interviewed, told Belochka the CEO of Shopify, he said if Amazon is building an empire than Shopify is arming the rebels.
NEUT25|The small and medium businesses on the platform.
NEUT26|Do you think this gives Shopify an edge in its?
NEUT27|Battle quote unquote with Amazon.
NEUT28|My honest opinion is that every single platform from Amazon on down will eventually offer a service like Affirm an alternative payment approach like a firm because it is taking off like wildfire.
BULL29|We've seen extraordinary growth over the last decade of doing this, but also even just in during the pandemic, as the offline sales shifted online.
BULL30|We've seen explosive, really unbelievable growth.
NEUT31|It's something that consumers have come to expect, so my guess.
NEUT32|Is it will become table stakes for everyone and not a unique advantage for anyone platform.
NEUT33|Now I know you can use a firm's virtual card as I understand it to buy things on Amazon, but you don't have this kind of a formal partnership with Amazon.
NEUT34|In fact, Amazon is also developing its own payments technology.
NEUT35|Is this something that you would like to do with Amazon as well, or does you doing with this with Shopify now sort of preclude you striking a partnership like that?
NEUT36|I think fundamentally the mission for us is clear.
BULL37|We want to bring this better way to pay to everyone, like every consumer, every merchant, and so we're excited to partner with anyone who shares in admission, I think.
NEUT38|The real.
BULL39|Goal is trebic witty, so actually excited to work with any platform that will have us.
NEUT40|"Always always here to to partner."""
