BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|We're going to be looking at the cryptocurrency XD which is orchid and doing some technical analysis on it.
NEUT2|I'm going to be looking at it against tether US based on finance crisis, so all these trend lines were drawn out in my prior oh XD videos.
NEUT3|So if you go back and check him out you can kind of hear what I'm saying.
NEUT4|I just kind of stretched out these ones, but ultimately this ones bouncing around him channel between 66 cents and about $0.73.
NEUT5|I mean, there's really not a whole lot to talk about on this one.
NEUT6|I don't want to overcomplicate things.
BEAR7|I mean if this support level on the daily gets lost around 66, I think anywhere from like 61 to 63 is definitely possible.
NEUT8|And then, on the flip side, you know break of like a breaking hold of like 7374 ish.
NEUT9|Could potentially send this one, you know, there might be a little bit of resistance like 7576, but I mean $0.80 is definitely possible.
NEUT10|If that happens and then a break of that.
NEUT11|We probably retest the top of this trend line or even higher anywhere from like $0.90 to a dollar.
NEUT12|Each type of range.
NEUT13|But a lot would have to happen for that kind of range to ultimately happen.
NEUT14|I mean, we have to break like $0.80 with some volume 81 cents with some volume close above it and then break above this this like prior like resistance level.
NEUT15|This, you know, rising trend lines.
NEUT16|I mean there's a lot that have to happen for tickets like that 92 a dollar range, but those are just some things I'd be looking at to the upside and downside.
NEUT17|And I mean on the four hour chart, these lines were all drawn out, just stretched out a little bit further.
BEAR18|So I mean we had some levels right around, like 73, which ultimately dig it broken on the four hour chart got rejected just below $0.75 and pulled back all the way back down to that support level, around 66 1/2 ish that we had already drawn out.
NEUT19|So I mean, this one's trading in a pretty clear range, like the risk to reward is pretty clear when you enter trade on this one at this point.
NEUT20|Again, not a ton to talk about.
NEUT21|The most important things to watch now are going to be breaks of these resistance levels, or like if the support level gets lost, you're just going to have to monitor whichever direction this one ends up going.
NEUT22|You're going to have to monitor the volume because I think to the upside we're going to see some big volume bars similar to here and here, and it breaks to the downside.
NEUT23|You know we want to see some of this small red volume still.
NEUT24|So I mean, it's pretty tough to say like I'm leaning more towards the bowler side just because of how the crypto market and stock market and everything has been lately.
NEUT25|But you know, it's always good to have a plan to the downside, because Bitcoin has, you know, we're making some pretty wild swings lately.
NEUT26|Moving ults around pretty heavy with it.
NEUT27|So I mean, those are just the levels to watch.
NEUT28|Doesn't need to get much more complicated than that, so you know.
NEUT29|Ultimately, I'm not a financial advisor.
