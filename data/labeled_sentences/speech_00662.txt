BULL1|Thanks a lot for that Sonia.
BULL2|Well BPL has been a star in 2017.
BEAR3|Gained close to 7 1/2 times in last year and in 2000 itself it has lost close to 22% of investors.
NEUT4|Well well what does the company really do?
NEUT5|It is a producer of a BS reasons and this is this particular market is an oligopolistic market and has high customization.
NEUT6|And where is that particular reason used?
NEUT7|It is used in parts of automobiles, home appliances, telecom and luggage industry.
NEUT8|So this is where we see the major use of this particular component.
NEUT9|And how is it truly made?
NEUT10|This is made using three major raw materials that is butadiene styrene, acrylonitrile while a butadiene is 1 material which is available domestically.
NEUT11|It is produced by the likes of Reliance.
BEAR12|An IOC are the other two raw materials the likes of styrene and acrylonitrile are largely imported, so they will be facing some sort of margin volatility.
NEUT13|Because of this import.
BULL14|Now company has has been on a capacity expansion spree in FY17.
BULL15|It increased its capacity from 51,000 tons per annum.
BULL16|Two 80,000 tons per annum and also now it is planning to increase it further to one like 37,000 tons per annum by end of calendar year 18.
BULL17|And this particular will move will make it the largest domestic player in the abias market.
NEUT18|Also separately.
BULL19|The company is planning a Greenfield port based facility expansion of two lack tons per annum by end of FY22.
NEUT20|Now if we look at the financials in terms of revenue growth, the five year Calger has been around 15.8%.
NEUT21|But if we talk about revenue cagar from FY13 to FY17.
NEUT22|It has been in single digits at around at 5.4% mark.
BEAR23|If you talk about revenues that we saw bump up in revenues in FY18 from $626 to 1000 cross that was majorly because of the new capacity that kicked in margins have been highly volatile.
NEUT24|I spoke about them.
NEUT25|That was because all the bramati major raw materials are imported by the company.
NEUT26|If we do a peer comparison, the company that we can compare it to is in your stylus solution.
NEUT27|That is the 2nd listed pure.
NEUT28|That produces a BS.
NEUT29|Also in yours has around 28%.
BULL30|Exposure to sales from polystyrene, but in terms of revenue growth, we see higher revenue growth by BPL in yours has only 11.8% in terms of valuations.
NEUT31|Both of them are trading largely in the same para meters, around 24 times and 21 times.
NEUT32|But what will be the key risk that we'll see going forward?
BEAR33|It is the adverse movements in the currency which will lead to volatility in the market margins and also dilay.
NEUT34|In reopening of this, that new plan that that particular plans is one is the one that produces HRG.
BEAR35|Which is used as one of the raw materials, and if they have to import it, the cost will build and if they have to import it, the cost will be higher.
NEUT36|"So that is something that will be watching out for back to you."""
