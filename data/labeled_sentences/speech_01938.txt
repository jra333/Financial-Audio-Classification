NEUT0|"""The big question today, do we have another China?"
NEUT1|Crisis now on this chart, this scale shows you the number of Chinese yuan per dollar.
BEAR2|It's an exchange rate and as this red line rises, so the yuan weakens against the dollar.
NEUT3|Meanwhile, on this scale we have the MSCI World Index, which is the main index that covers all the world's developed markets, not just EU.
NEUT4|Now, what's very interesting is that you can see that the last big scare for world stock markets was triggered by the China currency.
NEUT5|You can see here in August 2015 there's a very sharp.
BEAR6|Very sharp devaluation of the Chinese currency that people hadn't expected, and you see a very sharp full in world stocks.
BEAR7|And then there's another incident.
BEAR8|When you see another big decline for the Chinese currency in early 2016.
BEAR9|Now after that it became clear that the Chinese economy wasn't in as much trouble as people had feared and then come November of 2016.
NEUT10|Of course we get the election of Donald Trump's.
NEUT11|In the USA, very major international events and that leads to the very impressive Trump Rally of which lasted pretty much all of last year.
BULL12|So you can see world stocks rose in an almost perfectly straight line.
NEUT13|Now obviously a big part of the Trump agenda when he was elected was about trade fairness.
BEAR14|He complained bitterly about Chinese manipulation of their currency, i.e.
NEUT15|Keeping it weaker than it should be, and.
BULL16|Perhaps in response to that you do see this very significant.
BULL17|Real appreciation of the yuan during Trump's first year in office.
NEUT18|In fact, by the spring of 2018, it's virtually back to where it was before the scare of the summer of 2015.
NEUT19|Now what is interesting is what is happening now.
NEUT20|As you can see, we suddenly have a very, very sharp.
BEAR21|Depreciation once again in the Chinese yuan it's much weaker than it was during the scare moments of 2015, 2016.
NEUT22|There are good domestic reasons for that.
NEUT23|China has to deal with the overhang of credit.
NEUT24|That means it's doing the form of QE, making it easier for banks to buy out bad loans and so on.
NEUT25|But there could also be an international policy dimension to this.
BEAR26|Obviously the US is threatening a trade war.
BEAR27|It's threatening to levy tariffs on China if you respond by weakening your currency, then you make yourself more competitive.
NEUT28|You counteract the effect of the tariffs.
NEUT29|Is China doing that?
BEAR30|It's not clear yet, but we do know that the president wants a weaker dollar and that the dollar is now against a range of currencies.
BULL31|Its strongest in a year, largely due to trainer.
BEAR32|Now despite all this, things like metals which are very affected by China have.
NEUT33|Moved a lot on this, but as you can see.
BEAR34|World stocks are really not moving very much at all.
NEUT35|Live below the peak of January, but that's about all you can say.
NEUT36|So I think this could be the critical question for the next few months.
NEUT37|The world stock market does not seem to think we have another China crisis.
NEUT38|"Why not?"""
