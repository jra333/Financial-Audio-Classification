BULL0|"""Pretty upbeat outlook from Alibaba."
NEUT1|I know you're not a huge fan of investing in China stocks, but what is your take away from some of those numbers?
NEUT2|We heard you know what?
BULL3|Again, you know when a company says itself that it's going to grow 48%?
BULL4|That's intriguing to me because that is unbelievable growth versus everybody else, including Amazon, which going 27% retail.
NEUT5|But my problem is still in China.
BEAR6|I mean, I look at Baidu last night and I do miss the quarter and but they missed the quarter because of medical ads that had to be pulled because of government regulations.
NEUT7|And I'm sitting here saying I've got so much on my plate too.
NEUT8|I have to think about something like that.
NEUT9|Ali Bobby.
NEUT10|Does a major RA rise?
NEUT11|Got all the analysts there?
NEUT12|He's got all the answers.
NEUT13|If you really think he's got all those answers, then go buy Yahoo.
BEAR14|OK, because you've got the rest of Yahoo value to pretty much zero and you have a couple of buyers like at ATT and Verizon.
NEUT15|It might be interested.
NEUT16|So my takeaway is if you really believe go by Yahoo.
NEUT17|Notice I am not saying I believe 'cause.
NEUT18|"I'm not going to recommend a Chinese stock 'cause life's too short."""
