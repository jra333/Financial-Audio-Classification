BEAR0|"""Sir, those Wall Street bets stocks that everyone went into a not looking the greatest today anyway."
NEUT1|Hello, everybody, and welcome back to craziness Trunks.
NEUT2|And if you're new around here, welcome to craziness songs.
NEUT3|Today, we're going to be going in a little bit of information about the multiple different Wall Street bets are having a bad day today and today's first video is going to be on AMC, so if you do go on ahead and enjoy, make sure to subscribe and like and watch the next ones that come out over the next few hours.
NEUT4|Anyhow.
NEUT5|Like I said to start the video or the Wall Street bets, dogs are not really doing too hot.
BEAR6|At this current point in time and today, we're going to be covering AMC first, so as the recording of this video, the AMC stock has gone down roughly 30% and is down, sitting at the $7.00 mark once again.
BULL7|Now, it definitely did go up a fair bit yesterday, going back over that $5 mark and doing really well to it.
BULL8|Yesterday today it's coming back down after a nice high from yesterday.
NEUT9|Honestly isn't too great for Twitch.
NEUT10|While it isn't the greatest thing to be looking at, seeing it all come crashing down after a good day yesterday.
NEUT11|It's one of those things that kind of happens with something along these lines.
BULL12|Personally speaking, I still believe there's a very high chance that AMC will start to come back after that.
NEUT13|$10, maybe even the $15 mark over the next month or two.
NEUT14|At this point, I'm not too sure if it's actually going to come to that $20 mark anytime soon, but these are the type of stock that you want to hold onto for a decent amount of time.
NEUT15|There's also a current possibility that AMC stock short sale restrictions will be expiring tomorrow, so that might seem nice.
NEUT16|Verizon the stocks again tomorrow.
NEUT17|I'm not 100% sure on that information.
NEUT18|Definitely going to your own research if you want to find out more.
BULL19|Personally, I'm going to be holding on to this stock as the theaters are starting to slowly open back up an once everything comes slowly back to a normal that would be seen after Covid.
BULL20|We definitely do see a very high possibility of some decent stock growth from AMC right now.
NEUT21|Would definitely be the smart time to beach is being a little bit more picking when you decide to buy and when you decide to sell, wait for it to slowly creep back up again once you start to see slowly coming back down, sell a bit of it, get a bit of profit into you and then buy back in.
NEUT22|Once it is a low point.
NEUT23|Right now it's probably in a bit of a mood swing mode that will probably go up and down for a little while until star.
BULL24|They have a nice, consistent growth.
BULL25|Powerful would also be keeping in some of the money that you're willing to lose, just in case things don't pan out in a good way, and whilst or all here, hoping that AMC will start to rise back up and we'll have a beautiful run up in time right now that doesn't look like a high possibility, at least with the current project.
NEUT26|AMC is definitely going to start rising eventually, but at this point in time it's a bit all over the place in a kind of been out of the question.
NEUT27|So definitely be a bit smart with what you choose to do.
NEUT28|Here is always.
NEUT29|I'm not a financial advisor, only as a person who's putting his own money into stocks and having a bit of fun with it and talking.
NEUT30|Not on the Internet, so definitely would either go and take a look at a financial advisor to get a bit more information about this, or do some research on your own as it's always a smart idea to look into things on the Internet because you never know what people could be saying.
NEUT31|They could be lying and giving you complete and utter nonsense to you on the Internet.
NEUT32|You know, either way, what do you think is going to be happening to Ames you over the next couple of days?
NEUT33|You see it's time to come back up again?
NEUT34|Or do you see to be in a bit of it's consistent stalemate space that is currently in weight goes up one day comes back down, the next thing goes back up again all over the place.
NEUT35|Let me know in the comments down below.
NEUT36|"I enjoy watching the little conversations that happened down the comments down there, and if you didn't enjoy smash like Smash, subscribe and I'll see you guys a little later."""
