NEUT0|"""This news is really dominating the markets as we can see right now and give us a sense from your point of view when you look at this, do you regard this as a blip that will settle back down again or something that could have longer ramifications for investors?"
NEUT1|Most often this would be a blip, for example, a few weeks ago we had an attack on Saudi oil facilities and the reaction was very very similar.
NEUT2|So the reaction today is almost exactly what I would have predicted if someone had given me advance information of you know of the incident.
NEUT3|But I think what this does is_You know, the first thing that we tell all investors ad nauseum and that is.
NEUT4|Yes, stay invested and don't try to time these things and 2nd to be diversified geographically and across asset classes.
BEAR5|As you can see today and asset classes were even with the equity equities we see.
NEUT6|For example, airlines really taking a big hit.
BEAR7|Obviously the oil companies will not do particularly well in this world.
BULL8|Bonds, on the other hand, we had a great year last year people were predicting this year would be tougher for bonds right at the moment it looks pretty good.
NEUT9|Yes and all it's gone up a lot was going to lot's gold.
NEUT10|Has this gold and being diversified.
NEUT11|Is, you know, makes sense because there are many different scenarios of the world that you know you cannot predict what happened today is not predictable and you can't react to it right.
NEUT12|You have to be prepared for it.
NEUT13|At this point, I think you know what is what should have happened is happened, and barring you know hostilities of the kind that the Brigadier General suggested, would not, we would not see.
NEUT14|That is not.
NEUT15|We don't expect a conventional war market should come back and regain their footing.
NEUT16|It strikes me there may be a difference though.
NEUT17|Between this attack and the one on the refinery in Saudi Arabia.
BEAR18|And that was a question of we retaliate for that we didn't do it, and so it sort of died away from being similarly, on some tankers in the Strait of Hormoz that happened.
BEAR19|And we didn't really retaliate.
NEUT20|Yes, this one.
NEUT21|We've taken action in response to an action they took with respect to US interests, and we have the Ayatollah Khomeini saying we're going to go back after you and and this was a very senior general who had a very close relationship with the Supreme leader himself.
NEUT22|That's right, we can be pretty sure there's going to be some reaction.
NEUT23|I think yes, as the general said, I'm not expert in this, no, but it's what he said at the end of the thing.
NEUT24|And then the question is, what number is the follow on?
NEUT25|How could it replaces a very volatile part of the world and?
NEUT26|If you look at what oil prices have done last year.
BULL27|I mean the return on being long front contracts and oil has been really handsome.
BULL28|It's been over 30% including roll up.
NEUT29|Right, but the market is saying that.
BULL30|On a forward looking basis, it is over supplied with oil and the reason oil prices went up.
NEUT31|Has you know a fair bit to do with OPEC plus letters?
BEAR32|OPEC plus Russia cutting back on supply in response to the surge in US production, over 12 million barrels per day.
NEUT33|You know is what's being produced here in the US.
BEAR34|So from an oil disruption POV.
NEUT35|"You know, barring serious hostilities sustained hostilities, the oil prices should go back to where they were."""
