NEUT0|"""Age play in this video chart on ticker symbol CN, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR3|Well, a bit deeper of a pullback here today, so definitely some things need to be updated here for going to the Little House cleaning.
NEUT4|Just get rid of these lines.
NEUT5|Sure, those levels still pertaining the chart there just not necessarily relevant right now.
NEUT6|And from a presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT7|'cause there's lines are really long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible, But the first update that definitely does need to be made comes about based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance.
BULL8|So when the newest areas of resistance right here at the $34 mark, which to be fair, there was a very nice late day bounce here.
BULL9|So the price is definitely within striking distance of 34.
NEUT10|So that brings about the big question mark right now is not necessarily in the price.
NEUT11|Get back up to 34, but more importantly, can the price actually break above it and stay up above it?
NEUT12|So 34.
NEUT13|Certainly the near term area of resistance to watch very closely, so it'll be interesting to see if the price can.
NEUT14|Ultimately, you know, get back above that level and then stay up above it.
NEUT15|Not necessarily does it doesn't have to happen on Tuesday or anything like that, but just moving forward.
NEUT16|So as far as.
NEUT17|Resistance is again 34 right there and then in terms of supports.
NEUT18|The level where I think it might have been a direct balance, let's see.
BEAR19|Klam care at the lower that Candle was at 3122.
NEUT20|What was the low from today?
NEUT21|3137 OK, so it looks close, but technically $0.15 off, but let's just call it the 3115 ISH area.
NEUT22|As you can see right here.
NEUT23|Actually right there had a low right there at a low and that's also right where the balance is happened.
NEUT24|So point here being right around that.
NEUT25|3115 is smart.
NEUT26|Going to be that initial area of support.
NEUT27|If the price does pull back if the price goes down there and then breaks through that area.
NEUT28|The next level of support after that point would be down there right around the $29.00 mark.
NEUT29|So keep trying these couple levels moving forward.
BULL30|But overall, yeah pulled back today.
BULL31|But Price does still have the opportunity to work its way back upwards.
NEUT32|And that first step is going to be the $34 market.
NEUT33|Let's see how it continues to play out.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL39|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT45|Then at the end I open it up.
