NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Eric Bleeker, analyst at fool.com."
NEUT1|This is my 1:20 on Amazon's Kindle problem.
NEUT2|Now there's been a lot of chatter recently that it doesn't really matter if the Kindle succeeds because Amazon's been so successful in getting people to use its app to still download their books on the iPad.
NEUT3|And that's true to some extent.
NEUT4|You know, they get the best profits from the content on that back in distributing it.
NEUT5|However, I have one major problem with this.
NEUT6|If you download an iPad, it still requires a separate action to go and use Amazon's bookstore.
NEUT7|Your default is that you will use apples, and whenever you request users to take an extra action, there's a high probability they don't do that.
NEUT8|And if they don't do that, Amazon can't profit from people downloading content from their store.
BEAR9|So I think this is kind of a mistake.
NEUT10|Obviously everyone wants the Kindle to succeed, but I think it should be more of a priority and you can't just kind of think of this as a secondary consideration.
NEUT11|"If you can control the platform, you can dictate the terms and you can distribute, and that's huge for a company like Amazon's America Bleecker and that's my 1:20 on Amazon's Kindle problem."""
