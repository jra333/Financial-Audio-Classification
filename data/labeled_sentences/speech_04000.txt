NEUT0|"""Example, let's go to Facebook."
BEAR1|Probably the most hated stuck right now in Wall Street, which is funny because only two months ago all the major news channels so hypercritical's unbelievably hypocritical.
NEUT2|CNBC and all these other financials before the face Facebook went on the market, they were all saying, oh, we're looking for this more.
NEUT3|This stock to go, you know, it was the darling of darling of the media, yeah, but I think most of us like must be between ourselves.
NEUT4|I think most of us knew it was Muppet Bates, you know it was bound to because I mean, I actually wrote an article about this on the day of its launch, saying that.
NEUT5|This is a train wreck about to happen, but it wasn't.
NEUT6|You have to be smart to figure that out when everybody is so excited about something.
NEUT7|When something is so hyped up, you knew that that market that stuck was overpriced.
NEUT8|You knew that the people who made the money was it wasn't the punters on that day we're going to buy it with the people who bought it way before hand.
NEUT9|OK, like the Goldman Sachs, the world that Goldman Sachs was selling 50% of its stake in Facebook on the day of its launch where it always makes me suspicious when one of these, like private asset managers, goes public.
NEUT10|Like when Black Rock goes public, is like why would any of these guys sell even a little bit?
NEUT11|Absolutely, why would they want to sell 50% of their stick on the day which launches, unless they knew that it you know what it was done.
NEUT12|These guys are not stupid so.
BEAR13|Yeah, so I basically decided the stock plummeted from 40 over.
BEAR14|We went to 45 at the highs and now was yesterday was 29.
BEAR15|I actually think that Facebook probably go down way to 25 May be below 25 but at some point Facebook become become so hated and is the thing people don't understand is I've made a rule.
NEUT16|Now my rule is this that whenever a stock or any asset in fact could be gold could be anything whenever its whenever it's people are excited about it.
BEAR17|Whenever people think they're going to make money from it, there's something genuinely wrong.
NEUT18|The markets are not designed so that people can make money from it.
NEUT19|Quite the opposite.
NEUT20|The markets are geared in such a way that people lose money.
NEUT21|Alright, that's why that's why Warren Buffett famously said that when everybody is fearful, get greedy whenever it is greedy.
NEUT22|"Get fearful, do the opposite of the masses."""
