NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well overall, yes, a bearish day.
BULL5|Yes it was red, but compared to a lot of stocks out there held up relatively well.
BULL6|Now I mean of course it could have been better, but you know compared to a lot of other stocks out there, you know Apple flex its muscles by just not getting totally destroyed because in the markets did pull back quite a bit, but Apple held its ground.
NEUT7|You know all things considered an from that angle, nothing is really changed as far as other or as far as the technical levels are concerned.
NEUT8|I mean if you watch the other videos they did on this one, especially the one on Monday.
NEUT9|Yeah, these levels here are going to sound familiar, but they did play a vital role.
NEUT10|Specifically that area right up there at the 124 mark, which was that initial area of resistance that I talked about previously and you can see that right up there.
BEAR11|That is where the price once again struggled today.
NEUT12|So 124.
BULL13|Definitely got confirmation today that that is going to be the main initial area of resistance, and if there is going to be any sort of you know bigger movements.
NEUT14|On the upside, it all begins and ends with Wilkin, the price even get up above the $124 mark so will keep a very close eye on that.
NEUT15|And if it does, it being the price get above that level.
NEUT16|The next key level to watch would then be up there right around 1:25 fifty in terms of levels of support.
NEUT17|You know nothing really happened here.
BEAR18|Yes, the price pulled back when I didn't even go down there and test the one 2550 Mark, let alone breakdown blow up.
NEUT19|But point here being that moving forward one 2150 is an important area 'cause I'm not saying this was going to happen, but I mean if the price were to go down in that area and then breakdown blow it all of a sudden.
NEUT20|At that point you'd have the price having gone essentially right back to where it was and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT21|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sound true power to strength.
NEUT22|Again, not saying that's what's going to happen.
NEUT23|But that is why that one 2150 Mark is important moving forward, so overall exit.
BULL24|Not not a great day, but still a good day with all things considered.
NEUT25|So let's see what this one has to offer over the next couple of days.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL29|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT35|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT37|That is again totally live.
NEUT38|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
