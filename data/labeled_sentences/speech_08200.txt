NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, overall a decent day, however things are, you know.
NEUT4|Still not quite really building any sort of momentum.
NEUT5|And like I said it wasn't a bad day.
NEUT6|It's not like it was a disastrous day or anything like that, but you know the price.
NEUT7|Try to get some separation up through and this will be a little bit more than that.
NEUT8|Watch the past videos, but I've been talking about that Purple line right there quite a bit.
NEUT9|The 50.
BEAR10|Moving average being that key, area of resistance and you can see that that is a level that has been very stubborn.
NEUT11|And once again you can see today.
NEUT12|You know it was being stubborn again, so the price can never get any sort of clean break from it.
NEUT13|And then last 30 minutes you can see the price is actually not pulling back down below that area.
NEUT14|So yeah, it's that purple line again.
BEAR15|Just very very stubborn and just will not quite allow the price to build any sort of worthwhile.
NEUT16|You know, momentum up through that level, so we're going to continue to watch that moving forward as that main area of resistance.
NEUT17|In fact, let's just do this main area of resistance is really up here at the one 2475 Mark and I say that because at least if the price can get up through there, that would illustrate that not only has the price.
BULL18|Firmly clear that purple line, but it's also gotten above this little hassle point, which you can see twice now has rejected the price, so really going forward one 2475.
BEAR19|Going to be that important level watch in the event the price comes back down, then the overarching level of support remains down here right around that dollars 21 ish area, give or take a little bit.
NEUT20|But yeah as right now things just feel shaky things.
NEUT21|Just feel like that purple line is still in charge and as of now we'll see what happens with it.
NEUT22|But yeah, in my opinion just based on how things are playing out right now it feels like the Bears are still in charge, but we'll see what next week has to offer.
NEUT23|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT24|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT25|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT26|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT27|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR31|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
