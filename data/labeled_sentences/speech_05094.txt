NEUT0|"""Today I will talk about Netflix."
NEUT1|So under charged a 15 minute time frame, we can see that the price is making some sideways price action and it's not the perfect timing to be in.
BULL2|But if you want to be long term, I believe this chart could easily double in the next coming years.
NEUT3|So if you want to keep in mind price, the risk management if you if you if you need to.
NEUT4|If you don't have a lot of money to trade with, it's a.
NEUT5|It's a good thing to know that there is some entry point for some stop loss that could be like I put on the stream at 5:15.
NEUT6|Also at the 507.
BULL7|An around 490, so that's some for some stuff plus, but I believe that if we we could climb and they reach this 545 here.
BULL8|So it could be we could be in for some good news and some strong move for Netflix in the But the the best for me would be to see the 570-2575 and at that point I would get in and that would be a nice entry point.
NEUT9|If we look at the daily chart we can easily see that the long term timeframe of the Netflix.
NEUT10|Is really strong people keep watching.
NEUT11|Tons of hours of Netflix every week, and I believe it.
BULL12|Maybe it will need another price increase of their of their premium service to reach the next level of $1000.
NEUT13|But they they did that in the past and I believe that if we look at the strong trend of when they first IPO, it's almost a trend of 20 years and I believe it's not DN.
NEUT14|Of this trend, and it's always at the price.
BULL15|Keep climbing to the top of the channel so we could easily see that in the coming in the coming years, especially this year or next year for another huge gains of two double the price.
NEUT16|And so that's my quick analysis on Netflix.
NEUT17|What do you think?
NEUT18|Do you believe that this charge is moving to an even?
NEUT19|A better target of more than $1000.
NEUT20|Let me know comments below if you want me to keep updating this chart.
BULL21|"Thank you and have a nice day."""
