NEUT0|"""Think of it meta fat metaphorically."
NEUT1|You know the cavalry is coming here.
BULL2|Vaccines are going to have a major positive impact.
NEUT3|They're going to start being implemented and deployed in December, and as we get into the early part of the year, it's going to be January, February, March, more and more and more people are going to be able to be vaccinated.
NEUT4|So if we could just hang in there, do the public health measures that we're talking about, we're going to get this under control, I promise you.
BULL5|It's doctor Anthony Fouchy with some pretty encouraging comments this morning on ABC News.
BULL6|Jimmy also said yesterday he expects M RNA to start to have data to work with within about a week and said he would be surprised if it wasn't as effective as the numbers we got out of Pfizer.
BULL7|Yeah, I thought that was terrific.
NEUT8|I mean, I'm, I think it's going to be rolling situation.
NEUT9|We get good news from all these Pharmaceuticals because you haven't heard any of these trials.
NEUT10|Stop and I think that what you want, of course, is good News Plus, as Honeywell said, Asterix Adamczyk said, but they have the files to be able to send.
NEUT11|And I think that that is a very compelling story.
NEUT12|I want it to be like polio when we be polio will be allowed to go to the school, so we already get the shot and it wasn't up to us, we just did it.
NEUT13|And I think that can happen here.
NEUT14|I think you have to go buy milk.
NEUT15|Doctor Gottlieb said today, which is based in.
NEUT16|Please don't go anywhere until you get the vaccine, and then you get the vaccine and we can beat this.
NEUT17|But Doctor Gottlieb's don't go anywhere message.
BEAR18|I think David doesn't sit well with America.
NEUT19|No, it doesn't.
NEUT20|And many people are resistant to that.
NEUT21|I mean, you see it even now in states where unfortunately, it's out of control.
BEAR22|Well, it's out of control and so many states right now.
NEUT23|But it's common.
NEUT24|We know that there is a side effect profile question.
NEUT25|I think Moderna versus the Pfizer vaccine will there?
NEUT26|Are there bit more side effects?
NEUT27|Is it a higher dose?
NEUT28|You know the right the higher lower yeah, the higher load so we'll keep an eye on that.
NEUT29|And then there's the question as to how many people really will be resistant to taking a vaccine, which we've discussed before.
NEUT30|I mean, typically it is still a fairly small percentage of the overall population.
NEUT31|It may be a bit larger now given how much attention is been given to this vaccine and concerns about whether it's been rushed, even though the companies themselves of course had been very.
BULL32|Transparent throughout, but Jim, we have to keep an eye on that to 90% is is probably the best news that we got.
NEUT33|I mean it's given so many people seem to expect a far lesser right?
NEUT34|Well, let me get my flu shot.
BEAR35|We all got the flu shot.
BULL36|The flu shot is alright.
BULL37|I probably got a 50% chance of less of flu.
NEUT38|I thought it would be like that.
NEUT39|90% means just go take it, Carl.
NEUT40|I mean I go take it's a two party members to two shot situation.
NEUT41|So you gotta go twice with vigilant about that.
NEUT42|I just wish that we already we have the military involved.
NEUT43|We know where it's supposed to be kept in terms of freezers.
NEUT44|What we lack is we actually know that CVS and we know that that Walgreens are going to deliver it.
NEUT45|I just love the timeline we all would we all would.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
