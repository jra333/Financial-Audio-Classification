NEUT0|"""Why would oil names?"
NEUT1|Why should we think about them differently as long term investments?
NEUT2|Or you just suggesting these are trades because of how underweight or neglect neglectful everyone is, and then you want to get out of them at some point after they rally, like how?
NEUT3|How are you thinking about these?
NEUT4|When you're recommending people to look at them?
NEUT5|Sure, I mean, I think those are pretty good analogues 'cause you know steel and.
NEUT6|Anne Cole are boom and bust.
NEUT7|Just like energy.
NEUT8|But I think unlike those two groups energies sort of centrality is as much greater.
NEUT9|I mean, energy is by far the largest commodity.
NEUT10|It's a meaningful percentage of GDP and it is used in all incremental activity.
NEUT11|You know you don't.
NEUT12|If we see GDP pick up as you were talking about 4%, you don't necessarily use more steel.
NEUT13|But if we start to see people get on planes and business resumes, gasoline.
BEAR14|In energy consumption rises in lockstep with that, so I think its sensitivity to GDP is so much greater and even if we talk about moving off winning office, it's going to take years and cutting supply is actually huge for the sort of price equilibrium, which is what matters to the stocks.
NEUT15|Yeah Tom, before we let you go, I do want to get your take on the broader markets here right now.
NEUT16|Looks like what 4300 price target for the S&P before your end.
NEUT17|How do you see us getting there and I guess.
NEUT18|What do you like?
NEUT19|How do you look at valuations right now based on everything we've heard?
NEUT20|As we're just starting to come into an earnings season now?
BULL21|I mean, I think the markets actually pretty healthy.
NEUT22|I mean, I think the risk reward is still really good right now with someone even wondering.
NEUT23|Is it too late?
NEUT24|I don't think it is because it's Josh said it's not just the Fed and Janet Yellen causing stocks to rise.
BULL25|Stocks are systematically rising everywhere because it generally it's telling us earnings growth is probably better than we expect.
NEUT26|But imagine for the last 10 years.
NEUT27|The average investor has allocated 0% of their incremental savings to stocks, 94% of all savings for last year.
NEUT28|When it's bond.
NEUT29|If some of that is now going into equities, let's see the next 10 years that reverses.
BULL30|You've got a massive tailwind for stocks to re rate, so I think the risk or it's really good here.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
