BEAR0|"""Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg is probably still laughing all the way to the bank."
NEUT1|Here is the wealthy meter you can see we're tracking his wealth by the number of shares he has in Facebook.
NEUT2|And of course the price of that stock, which has been quite the topic of conversation for since it went public on May 18th July.
BULL3|Thanks for joining us this morning.
NEUT4|Appreciate it.
NEUT5|You know a lot of people talk about Mark Zuckerberg and obviously that's the big story.
NEUT6|We see multibillionaire, but a lot of little investors.
BEAR7|Who tried to get in on this deal had a really tough time.
BEAR8|We've all been talking about it in the last couple of weeks and it seems that the overall effect could be that they've soured on the stock market in general.
NEUT9|Is that right?
BEAR10|Yeah, the Facebook IPO basically reconfirmed small investors fears about the stock market once they had before, so so, not only did the stock go down, which is just kind of a fact of the market, so there's not much we can do about that.
NEUT11|The all of the things we take for granted, such as placing orders and then being filled, placing limit orders, and then being filled.
NEUT12|You know, at or below the limit price.
NEUT13|Those didn't work either.
NEUT14|And then on top of that you have investment bankers, apparently giving information to institutional investors that small investors didn't have access to.
NEUT15|So really this Facebook, you know, kind of debacle is just the all of the fears they've always had.
NEUT16|Kind of in miniature.
NEUT17|And when we look at this, we were just looking at a chart of this stock.
BEAR18|It's off 16% since going public.
BEAR19|How much of this do you think is blamed at the feet of Facebook and the company itself?
NEUT20|And how much is just the hype that was around this?
NEUT21|The sort of hope that was put into this as sort of.
NEUT22|Getting back to the days where we could have a big spectacular IPO, especially in the tech sector, you know we're investors just too invested in the hype of it all.
BULL23|Yeah, I think smaller investors, especially overestimated the kind of pop that they would see on that first day with lots of other IPO's including some of the ones last year.
NEUT24|Like LinkedIn you saw a huge jump up.
BEAR25|You saw a huge jump up and Groupon and then later those stocks kind of petered off.
NEUT26|So if anything the lack of a pop on the first day is kind of a combination of some of these logistical problems that we saw.
NEUT27|And I guess maybe some of us overestimating the amount of hype that small investors actually had for this stock, even even though they like Facebook, is a product they've seen.
NEUT28|What's happened to all the other products and stocks that they love, and so they're not buying into it in the same way they did, say back in 2001?
BEAR29|And the flash crash of 2010 also played into this year with the stock market dropped about 1000 points.
BEAR30|Again, a technical glitch.
NEUT31|It seemed it has the technical aspect of investing really changed so much to the point where the small investor doesn't feel they're getting a fair share.
BEAR32|Yeah, yeah, I mean, I, as I said before, this is just kind of the latest in a series of technical glitches.
NEUT33|So there's the Facebook problem.
NEUT34|There is the flash crash.
NEUT35|There's the bats IPO and then having to them having to withdraw that.
NEUT36|And the things that you know.
NEUT37|As I said, the things that were taken for granted, like placing I spoke to one investor who placed a limit order to buy shares at $39.00 per share.
NEUT38|So that was the maximum he was willing to pay and it got filled at $40 per share.
NEUT39|You know, that's the kind of thing that's not supposed to happen, so there's the feeling that not only is the stock market and stable price wise, but the people who are running it either don't have the technical know how.
BEAR40|"Or, or you know, doing something untrustworthy that you know is causing all of the things the technical foundations to breakdown."""
