NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Clay trader and this will be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the daily timeframe Fregat started want for disclosures sake that I do own shares long in this in my retirement accounts.
NEUT2|I've done this analysis quite a few times.
NEUT3|I think the last time I did it was several weeks ago, but unless you live under a rock I'm sure you know that Apple had earnings and that the market apparently like those earnings with the big gap up huge volume.
NEUT4|So want to get some things you know updated here.
NEUT5|As like I said, I've done this before, so that's red and green lines are coming from, but they will look kind of silly now that these lines are down here on the price is way up there.
NEUT6|So the first thing to do is just some house cleaning.
NEUT7|Get rid of these lines.
NEUT8|Sure they still pertain to the chart, but in the spirit from a presentation standpoint of not wanting to have a million lines of where that can cause clutter and confusion.
NEUT9|Just want to try to keep this as straightforward as possible, so.
NEUT10|And this is going to be a good problem that we have in terms of.
BEAR11|I realize it's getting harder to see, but that's just 'cause the price hasn't been up as high for a long time.
BULL12|So yes, as a as an investor in Apple, I will say that I'm very pleased with today's price action.
NEUT13|So what am I going to be keeping an eye on going forward?
NEUT14|Well, ideally speaking, 120 is important to me because, you know, I don't want to see the price go back to where it was.
NEUT15|I want to see the price.
NEUT16|Just continue on and justice.
NEUT17|Make progress as time goes by.
NEUT18|Progress being defined as put in higher lows and a dollar or not a dollar 120 is important because you know the price closes.
NEUT19|Blow it out.
NEUT20|Blow it, or worse, that separates the downside.
NEUT21|At that point time, it's not like the entire charge ruined, but that does put it back inside of this range where it's banned for literally months upon months upon months.
NEUT22|And I don't want to see the price fall back inside of that range.
NEUT23|Whereas let's say the price pulls back here.
NEUT24|Bounces around and then heads back up well at that point in time that is just continuation of the current trend.
NEUT25|Meaning well, you have a set of laws right there.
NEUT26|Then you have this set down here and then you have that one and that one, and so on and so forth.
NEUT27|And if you picture those stair steps, that's just good solid continuation of the trend.
NEUT28|So I realized that a dollar or 120 is quite a bit of ways below where it's at right now.
NEUT29|But like I said, I'm an investor or so from the big picture perspective.
NEUT30|I just want to see continued progress forward and I don't want to see the price fall back inside of the range where it was, and that's what I'm kind of defining as 120.
NEUT31|Now, preferably speaking, if it does pull back if the price can hold up above $1.20, or why do I keep saying a dollar 123 fifty?
BULL32|You know that would be a very good sign of strength, so that will be another area of support right there.
NEUT33|Now, what about levels of resistance?
BULL34|If this upward move is going to continue where some of these key battlegrounds at an it's not quite there, but definitely entering in the neighborhood where there's been a lot of bearishness.
NEUT35|And I'm just going to make a range up here since it's not exact, but the top of the range up there at one 3450.
NEUT36|And then.
NEUT37|The initial part of the range right here at one 3275.
NEUT38|This is going back.
NEUT39|One was that you know.
NEUT40|Back in 2015 you can see right around these areas.
NEUT41|Quite a bit of history knocking down the price still work to be done, so I'm by no means am I implying that the price needs to get up there by like the next couple of weeks and breakthrough it or else this chart is totally worthless.
NEUT42|I'm not saying that I'm just saying from the big big picture perspective.
NEUT43|You know this is kind of definitely where the bears are hanging out.
BULL44|They clearly have a forward up here.
NEUT45|So if the Bulls are going to fight through that Fort, they're going to really have to bring their a game.
NEUT46|But you know, as long as the price keeps on doing what it's been doing in terms of building those higher lows, the charge is going to continue to take care of itself like it's been doing since basically.
NEUT47|May of last year, so let's see what happens with it.
NEUT48|One of the most popular questions I get is likely, how do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT49|So what I've done is put together this free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT50|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader and Bella means click right there to get access to the guide.
NEUT51|The guide itself is very short and to the point, and like I say it is free.
BULL52|Thanks for watching.
NEUT53|"Have a good one."""
