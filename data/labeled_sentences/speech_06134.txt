NEUT0|"""Got it, I want to turn to what I think is an extremely important financial story."
NEUT1|It is very wonky as you might say.
NEUT2|I'm kind of preemptively telling you this to avoid the buzzer.
BEAR3|I listen to this a record $5.5 trillion worth of government bonds worldwide now have a negative yield.
NEUT4|A please please don't buzz me on this is this is very important.
NEUT5|That means there's five and a half trillion dollars worth of money in bonds which pay you no interest whatsoever and in which you actually give money to the bond issuer.
NEUT6|Governments usually what's with that.
NEUT7|Steve Forbes.
BEAR8|I mean, you know there's a great reluctance on our part to cover this story because it is very, very wonky.
NEUT9|Negative interest right now there's a turn off, but it is vitally important to what's going on in the world, isn't it?
NEUT10|What's happening is the equivalent rent control, suppressing the price of borrowing and lending money and redo that you deform the credit markets, which hurts small and new businesses.
NEUT11|You see it in this country seat.
BEAR12|In Europe, you're going to see it again in Japan, negative interest rates are even worse.
NEUT13|That's attacks on financial services.
NEUT14|And that's going to drive the sound, but why is it happening as such as central bankers?
NEUT15|Central bankers now meet the definition of insanity.
NEUT16|They've been trying this for year after year after year suppressing interest rates by gobbling up government bonds, allocating credit to the government, thinking that stimulates the economy.
NEUT17|Manifestly, it has not.
NEUT18|So what do they do?
NEUT19|They double down and do it more?
NEUT20|It's bizarre when people write the history this year, they're going to say what was the matter with these people?
NEUT21|Didn't they learn and also's indictment of the political class?
BEAR22|In this country and in Europe and Japan that when you have this manifest failure.
NEUT23|They don't call him to account through it.
NEUT24|There's other news to the Federal Reserve US central bank is saying to US banks get ready, -3 months yields 3 month.
NEUT25|Bill yeah, so they could test the banks in coming months to get ready for US.
NEUT26|Savers pay to save your going to have to pay the US government save on the 3 month T bill.
BEAR27|Negative yields so if I Europe failed in Japan.
NEUT28|So we're going to failure here really bright stuff.
NEUT29|You think that if it happens.
NEUT30|If I lend money to the government for 3 months.
NEUT31|And I don't get any interest.
NEUT32|In fact, they keep a little of my money.
BEAR33|That's a disaster.
NEUT34|You think.
BEAR35|Of course, it's a disaster.
NEUT36|It means you don't have working credit markets if you don't know the price of a lending, especially short term lending.
NEUT37|If you're a private lender, guess what?
BEAR38|Loans stay flat or go down, which is what's been happening faster.
BEAR39|It's disastrous.
NEUT40|Look, thank you very much for approaching a very difficult story, but a very important story.
NEUT41|It's absolutely important, and because it's difficult, is why these people get away with their failures alright?
BULL42|"Thank you very much indeed, Steve."""
