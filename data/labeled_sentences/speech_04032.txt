BEAR0|"""OK, no, I promise you guys yesterday that I was going to put like a G down on my stocks."
NEUT1|I did.
NEUT2|I ended up pulling out of Netflix and I ended up putting about 9 something into Apple.
NEUT3|I love Apple.
BULL4|It's a strong company.
BULL5|Strong, strong company.
NEUT6|It's going to last for a very long time.
NEUT7|So if you like long term holds I think Apple is the way to go.
NEUT8|Tesla is a little tricky right now.
NEUT9|Like I said, I'm reading different things.
NEUT10|I'm viewing it modern monitoring it every day.
NEUT11|I don't see it going down.
BULL12|Actually went up a little bit today.
NEUT13|I still have my shares in test the I'm not sure if I'm going to get rid of it.
NEUT14|I'm just going to.
NEUT15|Look at it, look at it.
BEAR16|Look at if I get a big drop 15 percent 20%.
NEUT17|So I may pull out, but I really think it's the future.
NEUT18|Obviously electric cars electricity is our future.
NEUT19|Solar lithium.
NEUT20|So look into that stuff.
NEUT21|But anyways, yeah, I was just update about the Apple stocks I put into an.
NEUT22|I'll send a screenshot of what I did, how I did it.
