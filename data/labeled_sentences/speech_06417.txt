NEUT0|"""So I figured that a good amount of guys actually enjoyed dividend investing."
NEUT1|So when I talk about dividend so dividends, it's not really my thing, but I've been actually getting kind of used to it.
NEUT2|It's honestly a pretty nice consistent wage or generate some sort of income.
NEUT3|You know money is better than no money, and one of the highest dividend stocks out there that really don't recommend you guys to buy is probably Macy's.
NEUT4|If you check out the five year graphic to see Macy's was at $69, now it's at $5 and if you look at the three month graph you can see may seem so.
BEAR5|Pretty much at around like $1617.00 and it dropped so much just like USO and now it's at $5.36 an currently Macy really once we open all the stores in less than six weeks.
NEUT6|Now if Macy's does pretty much open all their stores you will be seeing the shares at least going up to $12.00 and you will be making it pretty sick profit Now let's start with the dividend part which is the juice is 1.
NEUT7|It's 26.68.
NEUT8|This is the highest dividend yield stock that you could ever find.
NEUT9|On Robin Hood and most trading platforms out there Macy's the whole reason why their dividends is so high is because their stock has been going down for five years straight and the only way to keep investors interested is by offering a very high dividend.
NEUT10|Now the only way that you guys could really make money from Macy's at least hold it for a year so you can actually get some dividends for it, so the dividends are about $0.37 per share and this is per quarter which is about $1.20 every single year.
NEUT11|That's about 25 to 30%, which is pretty sweet.
NEUT12|So you guys have like 100 shares of Macy's.
NEUT13|You're getting about roughly $100.
NEUT14|And that's a mere investment of $500 on Macy's stock.
BEAR15|And the thing about Macy's is it's so low to the point that the economy does recover.
BULL16|You'll be seeing the stock going up if it's at $11.00.
NEUT17|You made, like 100% profit on the underlying stock, you should probably sell.
NEUT18|On top of that, if you do have 100 shares of Macy's, be kind of careful since.
NEUT19|It might go down even for even more, So what better way is there to sell some covered calls?
NEUT20|You collect the premium by selling this option right here.
NEUT21|I did make a whole video about it, so definitely be interested.
NEUT22|So not only can you guys make about like $12.00 every single week, but could also get about $0.37 per share of the dividends every single three months, which is 1/4, so that is also pretty sweet.
NEUT23|And overall Macy's is kind of weird, but you guys can actually do it right time to stock correctly and get the dividends and also sell premiums, right?
NEUT24|You can actually make a profit.
NEUT25|On a falling stock, which is honestly pretty insane, so this is the highest dividend stock that's available for you to buy.
NEUT26|26.68.
BEAR27|Usually high dividend stocks are not well grow.
NEUT28|You can see here it's always going down in future videos.
NEUT29|I will be talking bout high dividend stocks where the stock actually grows in value every single year.
BULL30|So not only do you guys get nice consistent income every single quarter, but you also get the underlying value of the company going up.
NEUT31|"That's about it, thanks watching."""
