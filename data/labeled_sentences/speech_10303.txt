NEUT0|"""I put all this out because I want you to understand the value of short sellers in this market."
NEUT1|I thought Hindenburg flashing up red signs red flags that you had to question everything, including whether the investors and partners like GM.
NEUT2|Even like Bosch had really a bit value, I had really done their due diligence before getting into bed with someone like Trevor Milton.
NEUT3|Did they know Necla didn't own much intellectual property?
NEUT4|Did they realize the companies hydrogen technology might not be all it's cracked up to be?
NEUT5|Do they still think it is?
NEUT6|For example, did Mary Barra, the CEO of GM who stood by Niklas throughout this whole ordeal?
NEUT7|Already know about the bogus truck video or did it take her by surprise?
BULL8|Come on there, maybe this deal was worth it to GM simply for the electric vehicle credits and to boost their percentage of all energy vehicles.
BEAR9|But it sure doesn't look good to me.
NEUT10|I like them with bashes thinking OK, I'd like to know they're on the board now.
NEUT11|I'm not saying that shorts like Hinderberger always right?
BULL12|Although they certainly nailed Nicola specially with Trevor Milton step in Gangotri.
NEUT13|Sometimes I think these guys are wrong.
NEUT14|For example, I like J2 Global company they target, I think dirt cheap.
NEUT15|I read through the short piece on grow generation.
NEUT16|The tractor supply for the marijuana industry.
NEUT17|And while there's some real issues, I still think it's good story.
NEUT18|But when it's short, seller highlights major red flags.
NEUT19|You gotta take it seriously, even if you only think that they're wrong.
BULL20|You have to contend with their arguments in the case of neglect, the bear case was overwhelming and I am glad Hindenburg went after Owen, even though the stock bounced today on the Milton resignation.
BEAR21|I don't like it.
