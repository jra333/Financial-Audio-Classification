BULL0|"""It's clear and I'm going to try for a long position here."
NEUT1|This is the LDP two minute chart.
BULL2|You can see it is breaking out above this little consolidation thing it had right here.
BULL3|The previous breakout point was 795, so let's see an hope that that is some sort of support.
NEUT4|So I'm going to put an order in there.
NEUT5|And if you watch any of my other videos probably let's see how high did it go up a size 810?
NEUT6|So yes, a 5 cent move.
NEUT7|Should be relatively.
NEUT8|Realistic I would say you can see it's pulling back here.
NEUT9|Help pull back right past those nine.
NEUT10|So let me try.
NEUT11|Just something down here, even more so.
NEUT12|Good thing I didn't put it in at 7.
NEUT13|Sometimes you don't need skill, just a little bit of luck.
NEUT14|I'll put it in there down at 791.
NEUT15|Order if I get failed, it'll show up down there and then like I said, I'll just go for a 9796.
NEUT16|Sell.
NEUT17|So let's see if I can get filled here.
NEUT18|Partially filled.
NEUT19|I have 1300 shares.
NEUT20|You can see right here.
NEUT21|So what I'm going to do is just cancel that order and then I'll just go with 1300 shares so.
NEUT22|Not going to make as much as I wanted, but there's I'll put that up at 97.
NEUT23|Well, I don't want to sell on the ask or try to, so I'll put those at 799.
NEUT24|There's 300 so you can see what's going on.
NEUT25|300 have been sold so far.
NEUT26|Seven and there we go out there so $104.00 like I said I was going for 5000, which you can see right there.
NEUT27|Only got 1300 but then was able to turn around and sell those up there.
BULL28|At 799 you can see now it's going up but the strategy going in was just a quick move.
NEUT29|So you gotta stick with the plan and the strategy going in.
BULL30|You know, I'm sure it'll go up.
BULL31|It seems like it's a nice bullish overall environment here on the pull back there.
NEUT32|And as you can see that original 7095 or 795 that would have still been fine.
NEUT33|You know I would have gotten out there, but.
NEUT34|You know, Luckily, this time with the video it just shot down quite or passed it so it allowed me to get a little bit better entry point.
NEUT35|So I guess these videos do help out.
BULL36|In that way it saved me from getting a better entry, but at the same time I only did get 1300 shares but $104.00, so I'll take it, but I would much rather have that fulfill down there and gotten 5000 shares so well good.
NEUT37|I'm going to keep this video short, so if you have any questions or anything about charts please let me know.
NEUT38|I also.
NEUT39|If your underwear I have a live chat room where you can hang out with me and other traders during the day very, you know efficient environment.
NEUT40|Many traders all scanning the market, but more importantly, they're sharing information with one another and when you have that happening you know what's going on.
NEUT41|You have many eyeballs all working for you and it just makes for a very beneficial environment.
NEUT42|So check it out.
NEUT43|Claytrader.com is where you can find that and hopefully decide to sign up and if anything read some testimonials and I'm sure you will and you can see right now it is heading up so I'm trying to trade this once more, but good.
NEUT44|Got a quick.
NEUT45|Trade and I guess if anything, this shows that things don't always go according to plan and you don't always get the full size that you want, but it is what it is.
BULL46|So thanks for listening.
NEUT47|"Have a good one."""
