BEAR0|"""When bond markets turn, the results are swift and brutal."
NEUT1|Punishing the complacency of investors.
BEAR2|Just three weeks ago, 10 year German Bund yields were approaching zero percent, with investors betting that hefty bond purchases by the European Central Bank would pull this benchmark into negative territory.
BEAR3|Now bond yields are much higher and the speed of the rise has certainly caught many investors offside.
NEUT4|Judging by the sharp climate market volatility.
NEUT5|Call it complacency.
BEAR6|Too many investors jumped into the bond market and pushed yields way too low.
NEUT7|In such situations, it doesn't take much to trigger a Stampede weave in hefty Futures Trading and exchange traded funds selling bonds and you get huge waves of selling that clean out speculative buyers.
BEAR8|After the 10 year German yield hit a peak of Zero point 8% early on Thursday, it had subsequently eased back towards 0.6%.
BEAR9|The pattern suggests the market sell off may well have burned itself out.
NEUT10|For now.
NEUT11|It's also important to remember though, that the ECB is still buying hefty amounts of bonds for another 16 months, so the rise in yields should in theory be limited.
NEUT12|Bond traders abide by the notion of not fighting central banks.
NEUT13|So ECB buying is an important stabilizer for the market.
BEAR14|But as QE continues we may well have seen the floor in yields.
BULL15|"After all, the success of QE ultimately means higher bond yields."""
