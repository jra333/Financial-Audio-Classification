BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on guys?"
BULL1|I hope you're having a good night.
NEUT2|As you know I do not like Facebook stock all that much.
BEAR3|I've definitely made more than one video saying to not buy Facebook and that Facebook isn't a very good investment.
NEUT4|I did label some price targets for when I think Facebook would be a good investment, and I think we're getting very close to those, so I'm going to be shifting my sentiment.
BULL5|I do think Facebook has been punished enough, and I'm willing to re-enter Facebook pretty soon, especially for a long term investment, and especially for something that I can scale into little by little.
NEUT6|I probably wouldn't load the truck, but as a you know something like an M1 finance investment, or just like a gradual investment, I think Facebook is fine to put back into your portfolios right now.
NEUT7|So let's just do a recap of me saying that so good thing is about Facebook.
NEUT8|So my last video that I made about it was a month ago and it's Facebook is the weakest thing and then right before that it was a video called Facebook Facebook stock?
NEUT9|And I just basically said that Facebook wasn't a good prospect for long term investments.
BULL10|But looking at it now, we are nearing the 200 week moving average support we actually got within, like maybe a couple percent of the support line.
BEAR11|The lowest that Facebook got was around 139, so that's you know, only $6 away from this 200.
BEAR12|We support line and weekly RSI is close to oversold and actually hit oversold last week.
BEAR13|So from a 52 week high, Facebook has now dropped.
BEAR14|A total of around 33% and currently sitting around 27% of a drop away from the 52 week high.
NEUT15|Looking at it from the other way.
BULL16|In terms of potential gain from the 52 week high, we can expect to make around 45%, so that's quite a bit of an amount to make.
NEUT17|And you guys already know Facebook is a growth stock.
NEUT18|Facebook is is a company that does a lot of share buybacks.
NEUT19|And they're not afraid to show that they definitely spent 1,000,000 billions of dollars on share buybacks throughout this year.
NEUT20|And Q2 and Q3 were definitely no exception, so I think they will continue to do that.
BULL21|And prop up the share price.
NEUT22|That way, if nothing else.
NEUT23|So when this stock market correction finishes, I think Facebook is an ideal to stock to be in, and something that I'll be looking into.
NEUT24|Obviously, if you guys are subscribed to my channel and watching my videos, you'll know that I'll probably tell you guys if I'm investing in it.
NEUT25|I'm not now, but definitely soon, so keep an eye on it.
NEUT26|Keep it on your watch list.
NEUT27|But yeah, so this is just a quick video.
BULL28|I hope you guys enjoyed it.
NEUT29|Hope you guys learn something and let me know if you're buying Facebook or what.
NEUT30|Your thoughts on Facebook are.
BULL31|"So anyway, I hope you have a great day and good luck trading."""
