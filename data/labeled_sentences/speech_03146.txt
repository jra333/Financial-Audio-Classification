BEAR0|"""But if you look at the, you know the fact that the three month 10 year yield has actually inverted since May is the Fed worried about that?"
BEAR1|Is it like an impending recession?
NEUT2|Is that what they're looking at?
NEUT3|More than you know the labor data?
NEUT4|I don't know.
BEAR5|I mean the message out of the Fed has always been awful.
NEUT6|Long time been there we shouldn't be so worried about the inversion of the curve.
NEUT7|There are different issues at play now.
NEUT8|I never really bought it.
NEUT9|I mean it.
NEUT10|It is a pretty good predictor for recessions, right?
NEUT11|So?
NEUT12|And if it cannot prevent it from happening, they can cushion the blow innocence by coming out early.
NEUT13|And I must say, if they do go ahead as it sounds like they were in terms of cutting, they are earlier in the cycle in starting the cut that they've done in any of the previous downturns.
BULL14|That I can remember so so that would help cushion that the downturn.
NEUT15|But you're right, you also refer to the labor data.
NEUT16|They all the probability models we have, or I'm aware of on recession probabilities driven off labor data are all flashing red, right?
NEUT17|So so we have lots of reasons for them to start to become more dovish.
NEUT18|OK?
NEUT19|But is this with the trade war?
NEUT20|That's here to last.
BULL21|We heard from you know Mr Kudlow yesterday, that actually they see the talk seemed to be back on track.
BEAR22|If the specter of worsening trade tensions gets taken off the table.
NEUT23|What does that mean for Fed policy?
NEUT24|I don't think it means anything really, because the Fed cannot run policies.
NEUT25|Depending on Trump's tweets about now we on again Trump's trade show is a TV reality show.
NEUT26|Week after week we get another one.
NEUT27|Now we are now off.
NEUT28|Now we love each other.
NEUT29|Now we don't love each other now nothing is happening.
NEUT30|The underlying problem is the guy is a protectionist.
NEUT31|He is out to change the world the way we had been working in a multilateral way and putting trade infringements on.
BEAR32|That's bad for growth.
NEUT33|Central bankers know it.
NEUT34|And that's why I think, actually, I think it's the key reason why we have seen the change in tone from the Fed and from the CP, because they're getting nervous about this.
NEUT35|They can't quite say it.
NEUT36|That's the problem, OK, but if the Fed cuts, is it one and done?
NEUT37|No, no chance, no chance.
NEUT38|I mean, yes, this insurance idea, but this is not the way it works, right?
NEUT39|I mean you, can you ever remember that you've seen a weakening economy and you do one and then you don't know if they start or when they start and they will start?
NEUT40|Whether it's that month or the next they will start our cases.
NEUT41|There are two four cuts in all.
NEUT42|"But the risk, even to that, is more than rather than less, because that's the way it operates."""
