NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol IQ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, the bloodshed continued today, so definitely a lot of updates.
NEUT5|The reason why I have a chart, you know pushed all the way to the left is because if I do that, it's just a lot harder to see due to that gap down there.
NEUT6|So by moving it over here like I said, it just makes things a little bit easier to see from the technical point of view.
NEUT7|So the first thing they do go do those some house cleaning.
NEUT8|Just going to get rid of these lines here.
NEUT9|Sure, these levels still retain the chart, but from the presentation standpoint, but not necessarily relevant, and from the you know from where I sit I want to make this chart as clean as possible and not, you know, create a bunch of confusion 'cause there's clutter and lines are really looks.
NEUT10|Like I said, let's try to keep this.
NEUT11|Clean moving forward so the 1st update though that does need to be made come about based on a foundation rule in charge in which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance.
NEUT12|So key level of resistance now moving forward going to be right there at that $18.00 mark.
NEUT13|So as of right now, yeah there's been a little bit of a upwards bounds here, But the question becomes OK. Well, First off, canvas upwards bounds continue and then second off and this is the big question.
NEUT14|Can the price even get back above 18?
NEUT15|Because just because the price might get up to 18, I mean it could still very well be just a dead cat bounce at that point.
BULL16|But if the price can get above 18 and start to close above it, I mean that doesn't mean that it's a guaranteed, not a dead cat, but it begins to shift the confidence level in terms of OK. Yeah, the price is actually starting to show some legitimate signs of strength, and that legitimate sign of strength quote unquote.
BULL17|Again, not only being able to get up to $18.00, but being able to get above it and then stay above it.
NEUT18|So watch that very closely if there is any sort of attempted, you know, bounces to the upside as far as always, up supported concern in the very near term that first level.
NEUT19|Nothing fancy behind that, alter the fact of the bleeding finally stopped today, right down there at the $17.00 mark.
NEUT20|So $17.00 will be that first key level.
NEUT21|Then I gotta squeeze things back or quite a bit 'cause we're seeing here.
NEUT22|It's been a long time.
NEUT23|Yeah.
BEAR24|I don't think this is all time lows.
NEUT25|I could be mistaken on that, but regardless, as far as what's relevant for you and you know relevant for the chart, moving into Friday, definitely $17.00 will be that main level of support.
BULL26|But yeah, as of now the bearishness continues, but we'll see if the pricing try to get things turned around and at least maybe even for a good quality bounce on Friday.
NEUT27|1st off.
BULL28|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL31|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT36|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
