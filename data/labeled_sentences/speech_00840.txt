NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol."
NEUT1|TLR why we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a very rough day today, especially after what had been a very impressive move.
NEUT5|I mean from that, Lowe's all the way up to there and then have things snap all the way back downwards.
NEUT6|Yeah, rough day, although from an overall standpoint I it's got me wondering, do we have just the bigger picture pattern that is now starting to form that pattern?
NEUT7|Being a sideways channel pattern an I wonder that because down here at this area where the price has been several times before and let's just call it the $25 mark.
BULL8|It's held very very nicely.
NEUT9|You go back a few days ago.
BULL10|Price held above their very very impressively and then once again big pullback down and pricing hit exactly today, but still definitely well within the range of 25.
NEUT11|So the question becomes great if this is some sort of sideways channel pattern that's forming then you know that's going to be level that continues to hold strong.
NEUT12|Now, of course, there's no guarantee that this is a sideways channel and we could very well get the answer on Friday if the price comes down here and then, they just blast down through 25.
NEUT13|OK, well, at that point.
BEAR14|Nope, the bearishness is just going to continue.
NEUT15|There's not any sort of consolidation or anything like that that is playing out because you know the that would imply that the bottom part of that pattern.
NEUT16|Has just been absolutely destroyed, but if this is some sort of sideways channel pattern, will all channels have a top?
NEUT17|So we're the top Ian that is up here.
NEUT18|At that area of 28, so that is really the I think in a lot of people are wondering, this is is this the start of a channel pattern or is this the start of a much bigger breakdown which all revolves around again that $25 mark.
NEUT19|But if this is the start of a channel pattern, meaning the price bounces up above 25 and starts work way back upwards, you know I'd be very skeptical until the price can at least prove itself by getting up above and breaking to the upside of that Channel.
NEUT20|Pattern up there around 28.
NEUT21|So moving forward in my mind, at least those are the two main very important levels to watch.
BULL22|$25 main level of support.
NEUT23|$28.00 main level of resistance, so let's see how this one closed out the week on Friday 1st off.
BULL24|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT26|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT27|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL28|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR31|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up.
