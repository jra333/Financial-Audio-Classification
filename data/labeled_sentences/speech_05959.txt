NEUT0|"""Citigroup, you know there's this never speaks out and never stays out of the news."
NEUT1|No like icon it to investors.
NEUT2|One pension fund, another an asset management representing a religious entity, have called for a breakup of Citigroup which would join forces.
NEUT3|Therefore, with a lot of economists and all sorts of other commentators who think this is the right way to go for the good of the country, really, yeah, what's going on.
NEUT4|So this is kind of.
NEUT5|The further step we've seen, I think about breaking up the too big to fail banks.
NEUT6|If you remember a couple of months ago, Sandy Weill, who who formed Citigroup, and the architect really of the supermarket bank, is reincarnated self, different human being.
NEUT7|Yeah, he apparently has has been heard by the nuns.
NEUT8|As you said, this large pension fund for Union and in this asset manager is working with the Sisters of Benefits.
NEUT9|Have called what they're doing is they're putting up a proposal for a shareholder vote at the next city annual meeting that would force City to form a committee of independent board members to look at whether it's split up.
NEUT10|They're not saying, hey, we want to vote on splitting off, right?
NEUT11|The Commercial Investment Bank, but we want it.
NEUT12|And how does Corbett, the new CEO there have?
NEUT13|So this comparison to icon?
NEUT14|I mean, if you got a way to fight this, and presumably he doesn't want to break up the banks, yeah, certainly.
NEUT15|I think he's not looking to break the bank yet.
NEUT16|He has said he's going to look at everything.
NEUT17|Came in he hasn't said too much since then, but kind of the vote itself will be certainly a hard fight to win, right?
NEUT18|So there's the Citigroup one.
NEUT19|Of course, being a dog for more than just this past year, right?
BULL20|But had a reasonably good third quarter it seemed.
NEUT21|And then, of course we had this spectacular departure of independent, you know, one of the things I find interesting in this is that it's somewhat vindicates the administration at the bottom ministrations approach to the banks, whereas they were under a lot of pressure from certain people, these.
BEAR22|To physically break up the banks and take a much more aggressive approach, they've kind of come back off and said, you know what we're gonna do is make life difficult for these guys and ultimately the pressure from shareholders to do so.
NEUT23|Yeah.
NEUT24|What is the feeling that did?
NEUT25|I think ultimately, this is where a city and a chase and some of these other two pigtails are going to go eventually.
NEUT26|You know, I would say there's going to be a lot more discussion about it.
NEUT27|I don't know that it's going to happen anytime soon.
NEUT28|I think this step, certainly.
NEUT29|I think we have to.
NEUT30|A lot of shareholder proposals are proposed every year for these bank meetings.
BEAR31|In the vast majority of them are voted down by significant percentages.
NEUT32|We get the odd city.
BEAR33|Last year was a victim of losing a say on pay vote, which was pretty surprising.
NEUT34|That doesn't happen very often, so maybe there's some chance that the shareholders will say, hey, yeah, at least look at it.
NEUT35|I think there's probably very minimal chance that the Independent Board committee would come back.
NEUT36|"But I do think it's going to keep going because until it turns real value, getting shareholders these issues, but it's getting louder and then they have arguments."""
