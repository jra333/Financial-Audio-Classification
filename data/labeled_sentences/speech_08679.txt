BEAR0|"""So here we go after a large drop."
BULL1|Yesterday we've seen a huge increase today, 48% almost 49% of an increase.
BULL2|Right now the highest point we were over 50% of an increase with Jimmy and it was absolutely phenomenal.
BULL3|It still is phenomenal.
BULL4|It's still going strong up to $179.
NEUT5|I'm personally still invested at $240, so I still have a long way to go in order to get up to mine, but I could have average down, which I didn't end up doing.
NEUT6|It's only two shares.
NEUT7|Ended up putting money into other areas, but GME?
BULL8|Is definitely making some moves here.
NEUT9|Hopefully we can see them in the after hours market.
NEUT10|Continue on that move.
NEUT11|Move up to $200 because that will be really amazing and then we can probably push two 2240 tomorrow.
NEUT12|Being a little optimistic but we don't know how tomorrow is going to go, but I'm really excited exactly what Jimmy did.
NEUT13|"Let me know how you feel in the comments below."""
