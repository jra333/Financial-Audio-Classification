NEUT0|"""My first look at this, John and Shelly and Lisa is this is an extraordinary report."
NEUT1|I'm looking at return on equity.
NEUT2|Published 15.7% return on tangible equities of ginormous number if I'm looking quickly here.
BULL3|At their very clear presentation, John, this is really an exceptional report on 1st blush.
NEUT4|I would also note the compensation expense and the expense of efficiency ratio.
NEUT5|John.
NEUT6|That's why you didn't go to the Yankees with the Morgan Stanley people.
NEUT7|This spring as they were trying to save some money they did a time.
NEUT8|It's not usually that goes to the Yankees with Morgan Stanley people.
NEUT9|I'm not sure who does, but it's certainly not me.
NEUT10|Look at another number crossing the Bloomberg.
NEUT11|The second quarter, equity sales and trading revenue coming in at 2.62 billion.
BEAR12|Tom upside surprise that the estimate to 27.
NEUT13|I do wonder Shonali what an estimate is worth.
NEUT14|An environment like this one are team, including you crunching the numbers.
BEAR15|The estimates were wide, wide, wide for several of these big names reporting this morning and what was surprising you can see right away after Goldman reported the bar was very low for Morgan Stanley.
BULL16|Going back to Tom's Point, that 15% return on equity is putting them in line with their goals.
NEUT17|Their longer term goals.
BULL18|"Goldman was at 11% yesterday an we wanted to see if they would at least keep on line with that, but they're showing a strong beat."""
