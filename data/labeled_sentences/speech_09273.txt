NEUT1|February 22nd.
NEUT2|In today's BN Geo stock analysis and predictions, B NGO.
NEUT3|Is life changing?
NEUT4|Alright, let's get started.
NEUT5|Biotechnology companies can be brought in their medical ambitions or they can be specific.
NEUT6|Interestingly, Bionano genomics, NASDAQ be NGO is both a specialist in a generalist and the companies suffer system addresses.
BEAR7|Multiple important medical issues.
NEUT8|This duality is what makes be NGO stocks.
NEUT9|So unique is an investment.
NEUT10|I'll admit the technical aspects of the NGO stock are also quite interesting.
BULL11|We'll get into more detail about that, but suffice it to say that shareholders have enjoyed tremendous gains in 2021 even among biotech stocks, which are known for making outsized moves.
BEAR12|Be NGO stock has brought seemingly excessive pain to the short sellers, yet the lofty share price might be justified.
NEUT13|If we truly believe in the science that Bio Nano is pursuing.
NEUT14|It's an age old question.
NEUT15|Does it make sense to buy a stock after a huge run up?
NEUT16|There's no universal answer to that question.
NEUT17|So we'll have to wait.
NEUT18|The NGO Stocks price Action against the value proposition of the company itself.
NEUT19|A closer look at the NGO stock.
BEAR20|It wasn't very long ago when Bionano shareholders were experiencing what might be called a rough Patch.
NEUT21|Indeed, there was a time in December when BN Geo stock was trading at just $0.50.
BEAR22|That was problematic as the NASDAQ has been known to sometimes the list stocks if their prices remain below $1.00 for too long, any delisting fears were put to rest in late December.
NEUT23|However, the bull train left the station on December 29th.
NEUT24|When BN Geo stock suddenly popped above the crucial one dollar level and then it just kept going, the be NGO share price reached $7.00 on January 4th followed by $25 on January 25th.
BULL25|On February 15th, BN Geo stock touched a dazzling 52 week high of $15.69.
BEAR26|Incidentally, in January, the NASDAQ exchange confirmed be NGO stocks, compliance with the exchanges listing requirements as the stock had traded at or above $1.00 for ten consecutive business days, sensitive and specific.
NEUT27|Whether all of the foregoing is good or bad news depends on one's perspective.
BEAR28|Value focused investors might balk at the idea of buying a stock after such a steep run up, but then at least the delisting fears have been quelled.
NEUT29|And if the trend is truly your friend.
BEAR30|Then the price action in BNGO stock appears to be quite bull friendly.
BULL31|On top of that, it's evident that Bionano Genomics is a true innovator with a groundbreaking medical tech platform.
NEUT32|As the company describes it, the safer system is a genome imaging tool for high speed, high throughput structural variant detection and analysis with exceptional sensitivity and specificity.
NEUT33|How sensitive and specific is it?
BULL34|According to the company, the Safer system reveals structural variants greater than 500 BP at sensitivities as high as 99% with false positive rates below 2%.
BULL35|Moreover, the safer system has a surprisingly wide range of medical applications.
