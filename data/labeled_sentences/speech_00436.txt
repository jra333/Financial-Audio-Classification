NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol S KLZ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Will a very rough day on this one.
NEUT5|You know.
BEAR6|Basically straight down the entire day long.
NEUT7|So a lot of eyeballs on this one.
NEUT8|So I want to get some levels of support and resistance here mapped out, but let's just first focus on areas of resistance.
NEUT9|Meaning if this thing does start to bounce or at least attempts to bounds where some potential problem areas, some potential battlegrounds at any sort of bounce might find well resistance at, hence its name and the first level of resistance to watch going to be right up there.
NEUT10|At $21.35 so 2135, first key area potential resistance if the price can push up through there for the next key level would then be up there at the top part of that little miniature consolidation right there.
NEUT11|And that's it's at 2225.
NEUT12|So keep running those couple of a potential roadblocks if there is any sort of attempted bounce and then from the overarching standpoint, the overall level to watch would be that purple line up there.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Moving average which is currently valued right now at the $24.00 mark.
NEUT15|So keep a close eye on that.
NEUT16|But like I said, that level is relatively.
NEUT17|Irrelevant right now.
NEUT18|As long as the price is below these levels.
NEUT19|But like Jennifer Price can quickly snap back above those, then at that point you would want to pay more attention to that 50.
NEUT20|Moving average.
NEUT21|But what about levels of support now for this?
BEAR22|Went to squeeze down the chart here quite a bit.
NEUT23|And go back a long way into the charts, history.
BEAR24|'cause as you're seeing here, it has been a very long time since the price have been down around this location of the sharp fact.
NEUT25|Let me go back a little bit more.
NEUT26|There we go with the next key level of support.
BEAR27|Now being down there at $19.35 and then if 1935 can't quite hold up next key level after that would then be down there around the $18.00 mark.
BEAR28|So very clearly lot of downward pressure on this one.
BULL29|A lot of bearishness out there, but we'll see if the price can at least start to stabilize or make a little bit of a move in the upward direction.
NEUT30|Over the next couple of days, First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
NEUT40|Totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
