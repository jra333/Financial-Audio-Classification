BULL0|"""Forecasters predicting a rollercoaster ride for the US economy as it weathers the storm of the virus surge and then hopefully enjoys the tailwinds of a vaccine."
BULL1|LED recovery.
NEUT2|Senior economics Reporter Steve Liesman joins us right now.
BULL3|He's got some fresh numbers from the street and Steve good morning.
NEUT4|Good morning Becky.
BULL5|Yeah, another vaccine Monday with two weeks now a positive vaccine news and equally grim virus news.
BULL6|Wall Street economists predicting a dark and challenging winter, but a strong rebound coming in the spring so far.
BEAR7|Latest CNBC rapid update sees the economy hanging in there in this quarter.
NEUT8|Kind of interesting.
BULL9|The incoming data suggest robust 4 1/2 percent growth with the major risk there being the extent of the lockdowns that we're going to see and the strength of consumer spending for the Holidays will be talking a lot about that this week.
BEAR10|The worst economic effects of the current virus surge are expected to hit in the first quarter.
BEAR11|The average forecast is 2.7%, but remember inside that, JP Morgan sees a 1% contraction and Barclays has their number at zero and then the third and fourth quarters.
NEUT12|You can see where the vaccines positive economic effects begin that kick in with above trend growth predicted for both of those quarters, but just how quickly the vaccine begins to have that positive effect?
NEUT13|Well, that's a matter of debate.
BEAR14|Victor are gone off senior analyst at.
BULL15|International investment firm ex Ante rights to start rehiring for permanent positions.
BEAR16|Employers may need to hear from the government that due to the vaccination, the population has approached herd immunity.
NEUT17|That's just one side of the story.
BEAR18|He worries that many won't take the vaccine in the US and about those without health insurance, they won't be able to afford it if it's not free.
NEUT19|But on the other side, Morgan Stanley they're really bullish.
BULL20|Actually, above consensus bullish they believe positive vaccine effects could be felt pretty soon, they wrote.
NEUT21|Over the weekend, quote the news on a vaccine.
BULL22|Will help to bolster private sector confidence that we can avoid further lockdowns beyond this year's winter and a full reopening of the economy can be a mid 2021 event.
BEAR23|They see those effects happening soon, so here's the full year GDP forecast to drop by three point 3% this year and now we have our first look at 2021 shows growth pretty well above potential at 4.2%.
NEUT24|Not a bad number if it happens stocks they generally put on Blinders.
NEUT25|To the near term challenges and looked to the recovery part as long as it's within some sort of six month horizon and the Fed as expected, Andrew stays easy.
NEUT26|Hey Steve, real quickly back to Becky.
NEUT27|I just you kind of put it well you put it all.
NEUT28|You put it all in great perspective.
NEUT29|This idea that it's going to be very important for the economy.
NEUT30|We have these vaccines people have to take them.
NEUT31|That means that if you can't afford to pay for it, it should be made available to you for free.
NEUT32|We should be smart enough to figure that out.
NEUT33|And if you don't want it, I'll take yours.
BULL34|Thank you very much.
NEUT35|That's right now just one of the things I want to remind people that the reporting we did last week.
BEAR36|Becky, it really matters how bad the situation going going into the vaccine distribution is the worst of X.
BEAR37|The worst of virus situation.
NEUT38|The more work the vaccine is going to have to do, so that's going to also play with the timing of when we get back to full recovery in a normal operating economy.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
