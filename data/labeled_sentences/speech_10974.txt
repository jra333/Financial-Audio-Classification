BEAR0|"""Nike is out with earnings shares off just around 2%."
NEUT1|Jerrod has the numbers for Richard.
NEUT2|That's right, and I'll tell you why.
BEAR3|They just one positive, but it's a rare revenue miss for Nike.
NEUT4|And let's look at those top line results.
NEUT5|Revenue came in at 10.36 billion for the quarter.
NEUT6|That's a third quarter for them.
NEUT7|The estimate was for higher at 11 billion and then breaking it down by geographic regions.
BULL8|Only in Greater China did they beat.
NEUT9|So we have revenue in China coming in at 2.28 billion.
BULL10|Beats estimates of 1.98 billion in North America.
BULL11|They were light by about half a billion dollars, 3.56 billion versus estimates of 4.1.
NEUT12|5 billion Asia Pacific and Latin America.
NEUT13|That revenue came in at 1.32 billion.
BEAR14|That's lower than the estimate of 1.42 billion.
BULL15|Finally, in the East, Middle East and Africa, the revenue came in light.
NEUT16|There two 2.61 billion versus estimates of about 3 billion now EPS was $0.90.
NEUT17|That's $0.53 a year ago, so up from a year ago, I don't have a compareable estimate to give you right now.
BULL18|Gross margins coming in better than expected.
BEAR19|45.6% estimate was for lower 44.4%.
BEAR20|And then the inventory ending higher than expected.
BEAR21|That could be a negative as well.
BULL22|That's 6.69 billion at the end of the quarter, versus estimates for lower of 6.2 billion.
NEUT23|Finally, one more stat here.
NEUT24|Cash and cash equivalents 8.52 billion.
NEUT25|That's a little bit lighter than the estimates of 8.61 billion.
NEUT26|So although I'm seeing this shares well, let's call them unchanged right now.
BEAR27|They had initially dipped on that revenue miss of 3%.
BULL28|Nevertheless, looking slightly positive here right now, guys.
NEUT29|Name to watch tomorrow morning right replica ring.
BULL30|"Thank you."""
