BULL2|So as we can see here, LKCO is the only one who is in the green with an incredible increase of over 20% on the day and everything else is on the red.
NEUT3|The SNP, the NASDAQ, the Dow.
BEAR4|This is the heat map of the SNP and look it was a bloodbath.
BEAR5|NASDAQ was down 3%.
NEUT6|So what's happening with LK CEO again yesterday?
NEUT7|Like I have mentioned on my previous video, LK.
BULL8|Co announced acquiring 100% of the map Go Technologies, so this was a positive catalyst and we have more people who are becoming bullish on El CCO, especially at this price.
NEUT9|And this is this is an example of.
NEUT10|How?
NEUT11|How the interest is like going up?
NEUT12|So I've used this tool for marketing purposes normally, but here we have.
NEUT13|I have used it for LK CEO to see the interest is just an indicator of of people wanting people are typing LKC or stock and we can see that is increasing again that this.
BULL14|Corresponded to the all time high of around $3 and now is going back again going up but just before it was sleeping so people are.
NEUT15|More and more aware of the stock here we can see the countries, Canada, Singapore, Israel, Switzerland, US, Australia, so pretty much a lot of countries.
NEUT16|Anyways, now we will go to the chart so I'm picking the four hour chart.
BULL17|And we finally broke the resistance of 1.98.
BULL18|We traded above $2.00.
BEAR19|But then we went down again, but that was due to mainly to the NASDAQ going down and dragging LKC.
BULL20|Oh down, but we are still above what we started with.
BULL21|So incredible, Despite that we had like a bloodbath on the NASDAQ, LK CEO was holding very very very strong today.
BULL22|Volume was up around 44 million, so that's more than the previous days and we can see here that we are the relative strength index shows that we're a little bit on the overbought territory, but apart from that what I see is that the sentiment is pretty bullish, especially with the new catalyst that we had tomorrow.
NEUT23|We have a big day.
NEUT24|The hearing is taking place.
BEAR25|And if the NASDAQ is going to be in the green, we might break again above the $2.00, the 1.98 resistance.
NEUT26|So there was another news that came up today which concerns China seeking.
NEUT27|Seeking a meeting with the USA next month was going to take place on Earth Day on 22nd of April.
NEUT28|Why Earth Day?
NEUT29|Because going to cover the climate change topic as well as on range of topics so the climate change is not the only topic we can clearly see here that China has urged the Biden administration to remove tariffs and sanctions imposed during Donald Trump's presidency.
BEAR30|So the sanctions concern Xiaomi.
NEUT31|I'll kiss you and all the other companies that have been on the banned list.
BULL32|Hopefully things will just improve from here.
BULL33|And yeah, we have more and more bullish sentiment over the L CCO news.
