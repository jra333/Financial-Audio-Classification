NEUT0|"""It's called in this video chart on ticker symbol C Civ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, an interesting day, but from an overall charting perspective, nothing happened other than just getting some confirmation.
NEUT5|Now I realize that yesterday stuff happened.
NEUT6|The price was fluctuated all over the place, but from an overall standpoint, like I said, the driving kind of word if you will, is confirmation confirmation of what will confirmation that red line right there which I've talked about in past videos is indeed going to be a very stubborn level andthat key area of resistance because you can see this morning.
NEUT7|Surprise, surprise.
NEUT8|The power of charts of that is right where the price got rejected from.
NEUT9|So definitely confirmation that if there is going to be any sort of bigger movements to the upside.
NEUT10|Right around 2415 is 2420, you know up around that general vicinity is certainly going to be that main battleground that needs to continue to be monitored, because after today's price went, it has been rejected.
NEUT11|You know up there at once.
NEUT12|Not twice, but actually three different times.
NEUT13|The price have been up around that general vicinity and the price is just never been able to really bane build and sustain any sort of momentum.
NEUT14|And I'm not saying it can't do that, but it's just become very apparent now that if there is going to be inserted bigger, moving to the upside then all eyeballs are certainly going to be on that main area resistance.
NEUT15|So continue to watch that moving forward as far as levels of support or concern.
NEUT16|Nothing new here to report.
NEUT17|Still have.
NEUT18|Ideally speaking that purple line there, the 50.
NEUT19|Moving average worth the price can now stay above there.
NEUT20|That would make the chart look the healthiest and the strongest, but don't get me wrong, if the price falls at purple blows that purple line.
BEAR21|That doesn't mean the entire charts destroyed, 'cause you still do have that green line down there at 22, and I'm not going to buy.
NEUT22|22 is important because the price isn't anywhere close to that.
NEUT23|But I mean you can just go back into the playlist and watch you know the videos from previous days.
NEUT24|If you're curious why 22 is so important, but as of right now, like I said, because of price isn't anywhere close to it, I'm not going to rehash all of that, but probably speaking stay above that purple line.
NEUT25|But again, even if it doesn't hold above it, you still do have that $22.00 mark.
BULL26|But if the price does recover back upwards, then yeah, no doubt about it.
NEUT27|All is going to be right around the 2420 mark, so let's see how this one continues to play out moving forward.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|Productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT40|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
