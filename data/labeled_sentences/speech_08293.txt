NEUT0|"""Last Thursday it was announced that Facebook will be added to the S&P 500 on December 20th."
BULL1|Well, the media reports were generally upbeat.
BEAR2|It remains to be seen whether or not the move will ultimately help or hurt the social network stock.
BULL3|I'm done Max with The Motley Fool an my analysis of the performance of recent additions to the index suggests that this is good news for Facebook shareholders.
NEUT4|Of course, for many investors this probably seems obvious when a company is added to the S&P, 500 shares must be purchased by funds that track it.
BULL5|When you consider the size of funds tracking this and P500, that adds up to a lot of increased demand for Facebook shares.
NEUT6|However, when you really dig into the numbers, it's not as clear as you might initially conclude.
NEUT7|So let's go through them.
NEUT8|Let's start with the Spider SMP 500, which is the world's largest exchange traded fund.
NEUT9|It has one $65 billion in assets under management.
NEUT10|On top of this, when you add the other two major ETF's, attract the index, you're looking at a total of roughly $230 billion.
NEUT11|Now let's be clear.
NEUT12|This is a very conservative number because it includes excludes other funds that made by Facebook as a result of this inclusion.
NEUT13|But even if you double the figure in terms of the net impact on demand for Facebook stock, that equates to roughly 2/3 of a billion new dollars that will need to be invested in shares come December 20th.
NEUT14|This, by the way, follow from the likely way to Facebook on the index itself.
NEUT15|Of course, that sounds like a lot of money, but here's the thing.
BEAR16|It pales in comparison to Facebook's market cap, which is currently in the neighborhood of $130 billion.
BEAR17|In other words, at the very best, the increased demand is likely to equate to only a half a percent of Facebook's total market cap.
NEUT18|So as you can see, this isn't much.
NEUT19|And it's certainly not as much as you would assume before going through this exercise.
BULL20|Now that being said, I still believe that Facebook will benefit from the addition.
NEUT21|Of the by my count, 14 companies then added to the index.
BULL22|This year they've outperformed the index itself by roughly 3% from the time they are added to the end of next last week.
BEAR23|Now, to be fair of those parking companies, five of them did underperform the S&P 500 and the subsequent months.
BEAR24|But that still suggests the odds are in favor of outperformance.
NEUT25|It's for this reason intern that I'd say the chances appear at the very least to be tilting in Facebook's favor for the foreseeable future.
BEAR26|Now that that's out of the way, I apologize for all the map.
