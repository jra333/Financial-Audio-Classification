NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol NFLX Netflix."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint, I do own Netflix from the long side in my retirement accounts, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
BULL5|Well, overall Netflix, like many of these other tech stocks, just continues to boom.
NEUT6|An more of the story there.
NEUT7|Sure, there's going to plenty of eyeballs on this one, moving into Wednesday, so let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support.
BULL9|Is what I would call the ideal oversleep would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be if the price could say up here above that level at.
NEUT10|Let's see what is the breakout?
NEUT11|.45 forty 750.
NEUT12|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 547 fifty, that doesn't mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could manage a step above that area.
BULL13|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
BULL18|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because from a big picture point of view and just gauging the health of the overall move.
NEUT19|That right there were being defined as the move.
NEUT20|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT21|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT22|Having us visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what has been represented again.
NEUT24|Yes and above that level would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the sharp as far as areas of resistance are concerned, they just don't matter.
NEUT25|What do I mean by that?
NEUT26|Well, let me offer up a bit more context.
NEUT27|What matters the most is what the price is already been doing, and that's this right here.
NEUT28|Just building these higher lows.
NEUT29|As long as the Lowe's keep getting higher and higher or if you want to visit these asteris steps.
NEUT30|So as long as their Subs continue to be constructed in the upward direction, then given enough time everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking areas of resistance.
NEUT31|So focus on healthy consolidations, folks on chipping away military bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL35|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT40|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
