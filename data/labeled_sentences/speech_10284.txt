BULL0|"""It's been a long road to this day."
NEUT1|We've talked a lot about election risk over the past few months, but we are about to witness what America is famous for and that is a peaceful, orderly transfer of power.
NEUT2|Look, I think that we're all beleaguered.
BULL3|I think that in orderly transfer of power coupled with a well defined plan to give us vaccines as they roll out will make it so that this market can go up tremendously.
NEUT4|Everything else, I think, is just I'm not saying it's irrelevant.
NEUT5|But you can't get this economy open until we figure out how to get the vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna into our arms.
BULL6|And once the president, since he has defined plan on that David, I think there will be rejoicing.
BEAR7|Right now it's catastrophic and chaotic and anything that indicates order will send this market higher.
NEUT8|David well, he's talked about 100,000,000.
NEUT9|Vaccinations in 100 days.
NEUT10|Yeah, and that's been the that's been the target now and so he will be held to that.
NEUT11|But to your point, Jim, there's going to have to be some significant changes.
NEUT12|It would seem in the way the vaccine is administered if they're going to be able to successfully hit those targets consistently.
NEUT13|Million people a day.
NEUT14|Where all the organizations that came on and told us that we could just get appointments?
NEUT15|What happened to them?
NEUT16|What?
NEUT17|Why are they not coming?
NEUT18|One?
NEUT19|Why isn't Walgreens coming on and saying, hey listen man, sorry how about McKesson?
NEUT20|Where is the bottleneck?
NEUT21|We know that they were making millions.
NEUT22|If we were to go follow a vial from Pfizer, do whatever the heck it goes.
NEUT23|I think we would find that it is taking a circuitous route.
NEUT24|Carl, that does not put it in our arms, and if it did and we did not rely on all sorts of people who didn't.
NEUT25|Never sign up for.
NEUT26|I think that what would happen is people would say you know what.
NEUT27|Now there's a path.
NEUT28|Now we can get there and that would be an incredible part of a new inauguration.
NEUT29|New president.
NEUT30|Jim, I am curious if we are going with the narrative.
NEUT31|Of course that this is now Joe Biden's pandemic.
NEUT32|How much time does the market allow him to demonstrate that daily vaccination rates are in fact accelerating?
NEUT33|Is this a thing that markets willing to wait a month for?
NEUT34|Obviously the administration is going to try to lower some expectations and say look, we've got to get into the agencies 1st and find out exactly where we are with the data that we've maybe not been able to see in the transition.
NEUT35|I think that because of the.
NEUT36|Over promise of the 100,000,000.
NEUT37|I think that it's going to be a Clock that is unlike any we've ever seen where there is a belief that right now there is a plan.
NEUT38|David, when you set out those expectations, the I think the Clock starts at noon and it is not going to be anything that can be avoided.
NEUT39|It is going to be front and center more than anything involving cooperation with Congress more than these executive orders that are going to maybe return the.
NEUT40|I don't know about the Arctic National Wildlife is that is we're going to.
NEUT41|Keep that sound from there.
NEUT42|I mean you know what it is, David.
NEUT43|It is Clock ticking so that our grandparents, our parents and us are going to get something in our arms and we're going to return to the way things were not exactly in 2018 but close.
NEUT44|I'll take 2019 now.
NEUT45|Why would that matter?
BULL46|That's a boom year.
NEUT47|Yeah Jim, we focused on it.
BULL48|We will continue to.
NEUT49|In terms of the rollout of the vaccine.
NEUT50|And you're right to obviously point that an by the way.
NEUT51|Yesterday, during testimony and number of I mean, Janet Yellen, a number of people pointed to that, as well as being the key first thing to deal with is the pandemic, and then everything else will follow.
NEUT52|Shepard Smith here.
