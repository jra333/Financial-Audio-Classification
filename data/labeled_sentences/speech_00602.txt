NEUT0|"""Alright, another chart I'd like to talk about tonight is Apple Apple."
NEUT1|I've been really stocking Apple since I think early September.
NEUT2|I never really posted about it, but.
NEUT3|So I'll just go ahead and start off where I posted here on October 2nd and here I posted a daily chart of Apple and what I was looking for is was a close below the trendline, so I'd really like this set up.
NEUT4|It looked like Apple was ready to move down lower towards the 193 so I was keeping a very close eye on that.
NEUT5|You could see the following day.
BEAR6|We did not close below the trend line and in fact the following day we gapped up.
NEUT7|And it looks like we closed here at 277 On this date.
NEUT8|So tonight and I just posted this here like 10 minutes ago.
NEUT9|You could see this is really what I wanted to talk about today.
NEUT10|Alright, so that's what happened today, so let's go ahead and look at that now.
NEUT11|Today we made a high of two 2993 but you could see price closed below that that line and I'd really like that candle.
NEUT12|So I really favor the downside.
NEUT13|I'd love to see a gap fill here at it looks like 220 two 2096.
BEAR14|That kind of falls in line with that trend line once again, but ultimately I'd like to see a close below the trendline on Apple and slowly but surely long term make its way down here towards this double bottom area.
NEUT15|At about 193, but let's take it slow.
BEAR16|Once again, Apple closed at 227 today.
NEUT17|Looking at the one hour time frame, so tomorrow I would like to keep an eye on.
NEUT18|Maybe this level here at 2:24 to see if we get a minor intraday double bottom, but again, I would really really like to see Apple trade down here at about at about 2:20 or this trendline.
NEUT19|So these are some levels to keep in mind tomorrow and to the upside.
NEUT20|Once again here at about 2:29.
BULL21|50 ish to to the upside.
NEUT22|Keep that level in mind and that's kind of what I'm looking for on Apple, alright?
BULL23|Thank you guys for watching.
NEUT24|"I'll see you on the next one."""
