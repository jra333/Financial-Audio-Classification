NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol SN DL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, another day and the price continues to drift downwards.
NEUT5|And to illustrate this I'm going to go ahead and make an adjustment and the question becomes about what direction is this adjustment needs to be made and now that we have more data, I'm going to just go ahead and adjust this area of support down there to that 98 cent mark for the simple reason of that.
BULL6|It's ultimately where the price finally found some buyers and got a little bit of a bounce there.
NEUT7|So $0.98 now going to be the main area of support, but of course I needed to adjust that support in the downward direction an from A Bola standpoint.
NEUT8|That's not what you want to see.
NEUT9|You want to see levels of support needing to be adjusted.
NEUT10|Up in the higher direction, not downwards now, just because I just did that downwards.
BEAR11|Does that mean this thing is going to collapse down to $0.50?
NEUT12|I'm not saying that I'm just saying that, generally speaking, as a rule of thumb, support levels that need to be adjusted higher.
NEUT13|That's what you want to see, but that just wasn't the case here.
NEUT14|So going forward, $0.98.
BEAR15|Going to be that newest area up support as far as levels of resistance, I'm going to go ahead and drop this line down here.
NEUT16|So again, resistance levels that need to be adjusted in the downward direction.
BEAR17|Not a good sign.
NEUT18|Not what you want to see.
BULL19|And a dollar three is definitely the new key battleground.
NEUT20|You can see right there several times the price.
NEUT21|Try to get above it.
NEUT22|Couldn't quite do it, and then of course as I've talked about in past videos, even if the price can break above that red line there, the price does still have to worry about that.
NEUT23|Overall Purple line up there, the 50.
NEUT24|Moving average which is currently valued up there around the dollar.
BEAR25|Five marks are going to keep a close eye in that area too, but again, one horrible time.
NEUT26|Let's just first see if the price can even break up above the red line right there.
NEUT27|So overall, doing the newest technical levels moving forward but from a grand scheme of things that downwards drifted downward trend continues, so we'll see if the price can try to get things leveled out or not.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
