BULL0|"""Good one by the way, though when we talk about IPO speculation Jim, that gets me to this Chinese retailer Munang that was up 400% on the second day after its IPO."
NEUT1|Yeah, you saw this, yeah?
NEUT2|Yeah, I thought the SEC might give them a Jingle, but you know the SEC is not as involved as I would like to think.
NEUT3|Or maybe a Senator game like there's like 100.
NEUT4|I'm someone must look at this thing.
BEAR5|I mean David, this is a travesty and there are people who are going to lose money, but we don't really care.
NEUT6|I guess it's all caveat emptor, but you and I both know David.
NEUT7|This is not what an orderly market looks like.
BEAR8|An Wu hung net technology must be of Wave 4, which is a company I said was bad company.
NEUT9|I called it.
BEAR10|Wave fraud or something marked late, more changes there, and the government called me wondering if I was shorting at that point in my hedge fund and I wasn't sure that they investigated by the time they completed investigation, the company going out of business.
NEUT11|I mean, who knows what this thing is?
NEUT12|What are the what are the technology arm?
BULL13|Wave wave remember way fraud but come on Jim, it's only it's only up 763% for the week.
NEUT14|I mean that maybe you're not being fair by the way that was advised by the way we did or I say when I say we, I mean squawk Box and actually the man who sits in this chair in juice or can talk to Chairman Clayton of the SEC about about IPOs and this one particularly take a listen to what he had to say.
NEUT15|There are more retail investors participating in the market than ever before, and we're seeing that and one thing that we don't regulate directly.
NEUT16|Andrew is euphoria and we're seeing somebody for a year.
NEUT17|I think I've heard other guests talk about euphoria.
BEAR18|You know, when stocks run away like the ones you mentioned, we do get concerned because it is.
NEUT19|It is a situation where a professional investors understand this.
NEUT20|I do worry that retail investors do not understand that trees don't grow to the Sky.
NEUT21|Kind of sounds like some of the things you've been saying, Jim.
NEUT22|But David, that's not.
NEUT23|This is not you for you.
NEUT24|This is not you for you.
NEUT25|This is broken.
NEUT26|Something is broken that that happens.
NEUT27|We want the SEC to look into anything that's broken where we gotta figure out that this wasn't euphoria.
NEUT28|This was just something that is simply.
NEUT29|It's like going to a store and seeing something marked up big and hoping you can buy it and then return it for more money.
NEUT30|I mean, I don't think that that that this is you for you know.
NEUT31|Yesterday we had the Massachusetts regulators coming in talking to Robin Roberts $65 million ten SEC probe, but there was an investors regulators that came out against Apple in 1980, literally saying that there was too much euphoria.
NEUT32|I don't.
NEUT33|I look euphoria to me is not good at all, but an orderly market.
NEUT34|Where you have something that goes up well, you know what.
BEAR35|That may be a mistake.
NEUT36|The long term, but this thing, David.
NEUT37|I mean it's just.
NEUT38|It's inconceivable that that's that that passes muster with the SEC.
NEUT39|I mean, why don't pick up the phone and call him and see what what's what's wrong?
BEAR40|That's wrong.
NEUT41|It's not you for it.
BEAR42|Yeah, it's just wrong.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
