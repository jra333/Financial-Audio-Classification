NEUT0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel in this video may be talking about a penny stock that I think has a ton of potential."
NEUT1|The ticker symbol is CIDM.

NEUT4|Round in the discord.
NEUT5|Alright, so before I get into the rumors and everything else, I'm going to talk about.
NEUT6|Just know this is super speculative play just because it's based on rumors currently.
NEUT7|So just be careful if you decide to jump in on this play and just to disclose my position on it.
BEAR8|I do have 1500 shares at $1.42, so the stock today ended a dollar.
BULL9|62 up about 7% for the day.
BULL10|Another timer recording this right now in the after hours did jump up about 13% to $1.83 and over the course of the last week the stock is up about 40%.
BEAR11|So what's been causing this jump in share price the last few days so it all started with rumors of the companies getting into empty space?
BEAR12|And although they're just rumors, they've sparked a big run up in the price.
BEAR13|As we've seen with other stocks like Katie and HOFV, as these have run up past few days after they announced they're getting into the NFT space.
NEUT14|So this is all currently speculation at the speculation is true.
BULL15|The stock would jump even more, but even if we find out that these rumors aren't true, the stock still let's have some good upside potential as an analyst price target of $3.25.
NEUT16|So why would NFTS fit into what this company does with the company's focus on content as they have a library more than 52,000 films and episodes and the company recently announced the acquisition of films around the world, which gives it writes to more than 150 feature films.
NEUT17|Now if you haven't seen the crazy prices, some of these NFT's on the market have been going for it.
NEUT18|You should definitely take a look.
BULL19|So overall, this is still speculation, but even if the rumors turn out to be false, there's still upside potential for the company.
NEUT20|I honestly think the company, if they were already planning on doing it, should look into NFTS just because I think that's all.
NEUT21|Make a whole lot of money.
NEUT22|Selling F from the content that they own and like scenes from movies and stuff like that.
NEUT23|As far as my personal price predictions for the stock originally, my price predictions $5 by the end of the year.
NEUT24|But now if these rumors become true this stock ago a heck of a lot higher than that.
NEUT25|But what do you guys think?
NEUT26|Do you think the rumors will end up being true or not?
NEUT27|"Let me know your thoughts and price predictions down below and just remember this video isn't financial advice, it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
