NEUT1|Thanks for watching this video.
NEUT2|Friends.
NEUT3|In this video we're going to discuss about junior court, EU NIU.
NEUT4|Now if you're looking at this particular stock, although it's being quite a volatile in the recent times, but the important thing is it is not breaking down.
BULL5|OK, it is well in the train Dan, it's been moving within the range, so that's a very good sign that you need to look at and.
NEUT6|You know, if you keep on looking at tick by tick chart, and if you're looking at what is happening after every five minutes, then you will end up with nothing.
NEUT7|That's the most important thing.
NEUT8|And if you are not a professional intraday trader.
NEUT9|So this is an exclusion for professional Internet writers and not talking about those people, so they know what they're doing.
NEUT10|But I'm talking about those who have purchased 500 shares, and looking at what is happening each and every minute, it means you don't know what you're doing right now.
BEAR11|Now if you don't know what you're doing and you will probably end up with losing money, having said that.
NEUT12|If you're looking at this chart, as you can see, the stock has been moving above the range and it is holding these two important support line which is in between 3.1 and 3.55.
NEUT13|So 3.19 will be our final stop loss, so don't try to go below 3.19 now.
NEUT14|On the upside, if it continues to hold.
BULL15|Above 3.5 in that case.
NEUT16|The first target that we're going to look at.
NEUT17|Will be.
NEUT18|Five point $3 now why 5.3 dollars is important is it is not only a resistance, but once it started in our trading over 5.3 dollars.
NEUT19|It means this green Line 200A moving average, which is a very important line.
BULL20|It is again started trading above the 200 day moving average.
NEUT21|Technically it is giving so when any stock started trading above 200M, simple moving average or exponential moving average.
BULL22|So technically it means a lot and it is giving an indication it will give an indication that stock is now ready to move higher and technically the chart has become.
NEUT23|Bullish, so that's why.
NEUT24|Once it started trading above 5.3, we have a two targets to look at in the upcoming days.
NEUT25|Bigger part in the upcoming weeks and months which will lead you to a target which will start from 8.6 and can go up to as high as $10 on the upside.
NEUT26|So these are the targets that we're looking at for the time being.
NEUT27|We will re analyze the chart once it started moving, but the important thing as I told you but I will tell you again that it is holding.
NEUT28|It's trained and it's looks strong, so this is the end of the video.
