NEUT10|Now let's get into this week's video and our new swing trading recommendation, founded in 1870 and based in Irving, TX, Exxon Mobil Corp ticker symbol.
NEUT11|Xom is the world's largest publicly traded oil company with a market capital of.
NEUT12|234 billion it has operations around the world ranging from Deepwater drilling off the Australian coast to conventional drilling in the Middle East in February.
BEAR13|Exxon reported big losses.
BULL14|Still, the oil Giants results were better than expected and next quarter's earnings should be even better, rising in line with the oil price.
NEUT15|Income investors know that Exxon is a big dividend paying stock.
BULL16|CEO Darren Woods told analysts that Exxon can maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.87 with Brent.
NEUT17|Oil at $45.00 a barrel.
BULL18|While $50 would allow the company to reduce debt or return capital to investors at the time of this recording, Brent is trading at $62.46.
NEUT19|Now all this does not mean much for a short term swing.
BEAR20|Traders were focused on short term moves in a stock with X on the primary trend of the stock is up.
BEAR21|The stock has pulled back from this primary trend, triggering a handful of Oxford swing trader algorithms.
BULL22|And we're looking for a rebound to this primary upward trend.
NEUT23|So let's take a look at these swing trade parameters.
NEUT24|The last closing price of the stock.
NEUT25|As of this recording was $55.22.
NEUT26|The trade setup is as follows.
NEUT27|The swing trade algorithms fired on the channel system, the overreaction system and the triple screen system.
BEAR28|The stock is also oversold on the relative strength index, the stop loss for the stock is $51.50 or about 6.7% below its closing price.
NEUT29|The target price for the stock is $62.60 or about a 13.4% game.
NEUT30|The action to take here is to buy Exxon Mobil Corporation ticker symbol Xom at market today set your stop at $51.50.
NEUT31|So there you have it.
NEUT32|A real live Oxford swing trading recommendation from Oxford Swing Trader.
NEUT33|Now, just to be clear, I can't guarantee that all my swing trading recommendations will be winners.
NEUT34|And remember, Oxford String Trader recommends an average of two swing trades like this each week, so you'll have plenty of opportunities about 100 a year in fact, to generate quick gains using swing trading strategies.
