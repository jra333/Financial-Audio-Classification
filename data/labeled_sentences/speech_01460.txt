BEAR0|"""Hello hedge managers, if you've been following Berkshire Hathaway, you've probably noticed that since the beginning of the year, there has been a loose uptrend."
NEUT1|We're going to check this out on D. .80.
NEUT2|Berkshire Hathaway since January.
NEUT3|So it's hard to discern a trend, but then we will look at the with the best fit line we could get the R ^2.
NEUT4|With best fit line.
BEAR5|When we add the best fit line, we see that the R-squared is .25, which is not very convincing.
BEAR6|However, when we filter for market noise by dividing by the overall S and P500A consistent downtrend emerges.
NEUT7|Relative to spy.
NEUT8|So we're looking at the motion of Berkshire Hathaway relative to the S&P 500.
NEUT9|Now with that.
BEAR10|With our best fit linear regression, we see that the R-squared is .72, which is much more convincing, indicating sort of a definitive downward trend.
BEAR11|So that's a bad signal that's one, but the second bad signal is that we've recently entered into a death cross.
NEUT12|So let's add.
NEUT13|Some moving averages here.
NEUT14|With 50 day moving average and 15 day moving average.
NEUT15|So this when we see our Golden crosses in death crosses in this overlay.
NEUT16|In recent trading days.
BEAR17|We've had a death cross pattern indicating a further slip into the bearishness for Berkshire Hathaway, relative to S&P 500.
NEUT18|So that's the nugget for today.
NEUT19|"I showed this analysis to my daughter and this was her reaction."""
