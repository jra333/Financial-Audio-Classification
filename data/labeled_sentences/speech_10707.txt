BEAR0|"""JP Morgan is predicting that the Federal Reserve will slash interest rates this year following President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on Mexico."
NEUT1|But that's not the consensus on Wall Street, Heidi.
NEUT2|You've been following this very closely.
NEUT3|What are we talking about?
NEUT4|I know Goldman Sachs was out looking at this today, right?
NEUT5|So Goldman Sachs is actually the contrarian here, saying that we're not.
BEAR6|It's not quite time to ring the alarm and say that the Fed is going to cut rates this year.
NEUT7|If we're looking at the probability, though of a potential rate rate cut this year.
NEUT8|Earlier this morning, before the market opened, we were discussing this, but according to the CME Fed watch tool, it was about a 17 1/2 percent probability that we were going to see a rate cut in this June meeting.
NEUT9|However, just before the show is looking at the number again and now it's up to 20%, but a lot of the people that are calling for a Fed rate cut this year are looking to the September meeting, not the one coming up next here.
BEAR10|And Goldman is saying yes, there is a little bit of a slowdown coming, but overall the financial conditions are that tight, yet they are moderately tightening.
BULL11|But inflation is still headed above 2%.
NEUT12|So it's not quite time yet, and if the Fed were to cut, it might look a little bit too political.
NEUT13|So he gives a couple of reasons.
NEUT14|He says, hey, let's just wait and see into the September meeting because that gives the Fed a little bit more time to figure out what they want to do and take a look at the conditions of the market, the economy, everything like that before making a decision.
NEUT15|But they do say that they do acknowledge that there is a little bit of concern here in terms of this tariff situation.
BULL16|They do see those increasing about 10% in July.
NEUT17|And this tariff acts.
NEUT18|I mean those impacts I should say are going to be.
NEUT19|Talked about when we talk about what your own pal is actually watching here, and we're going to hear him speak tomorrow.
NEUT20|And that's something that we will be tracking here.
NEUT21|Of course, on Yahoo Finance, but one is all over, always, always over there.
NEUT22|But when we're talking about that, that chance of a September rate hike, it was interesting to see the way that it's been rising constantly.
NEUT23|When you look at it and you're right, I mean, that's something that 80% of people are now pricing in when we look about we talk about a September rate hike, but that was not what was just a couple months ago, exactly.
NEUT24|People were throwing that are deer around, but a lot of people were saying no, that's not going to happen.
NEUT25|But now if you look at.
NEUT26|Look at this chart from Deutsche Bank.
NEUT27|It's 85% chance that it's going to happen in September whether or not that is the case.
BEAR28|Of course, it's up to the Fed to decide that, but of course you mentioned earlier in the show that the manufacturing data was rather weak.
NEUT29|"We also do have the jobs report that will be very closely watching coming out on Friday, so a lot of key economic data coming out that I'm sure a lot of market watchers will be keeping an eye on the Fed will be keeping an eye on everything, so data dependent we talk about, right?"""
