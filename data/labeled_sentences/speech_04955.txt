BEAR0|"""Hey guys, in this video I will be breaking down my 2020 predictions, especially with the new Year coming up."
BULL1|I think there are some definite candidates that will definitely take off in 2020 though as a new year and new decade rules around the corner, there's always been a Top Stock that greatly succeeded.
BULL2|2019 was Apple with a consistent growth of 105%.
NEUT3|You might be wondering.
NEUT4|Well, my prediction for next Amazon or Netflix would be from my analysis.
NEUT5|I believe 2020's company would be to plant based meat company.
NEUT6|Beyond meat for ticker symbol is BYND.
NEUT7|Unless you're under a rock to entire time, you might have realized that there's been a lot of trending with keeping our Earth green.
NEUT8|For example, Mr Beast 20 million trees does huge, many influencers jumped on the opportunity.
BULL9|It was amazing.
NEUT10|Everyone.
BULL11|It was nice to see everyone unified in a way.
NEUT12|There was also that moment of save the bees and just save the turtles too with the.
NEUT13|Metal straws for you.
BEAR14|Fairly drop shippers out there.
NEUT15|There's really now, I believe 2020 will keep running with this trend and I love it.
NEUT16|You know everyone just keep the earth green, but especially for me and just some of the people around me, I don't see their lifestyles have changed really.
NEUT17|I think more of the green climate change deal is more of like a social pressure so I don't know if you'd be more socially aware not to litter and just things like that.
BEAR18|Actually, if you did something that's it against the environment on the Internet, you'll be flamed.
NEUT19|You might already see beyond meat in some major chain restaurants like Taco Bell, one of the main things you might have noticed was it.
NEUT20|It's more expensive than me.
NEUT21|That doesn't really make any sense for you, right?
NEUT22|You know 'cause you think that's regular meat taste better than plant based meat, so not a lot of people take that leap of faith, but I think with the trend in 2019 with proper funding, they'll be able to make more cost efficient way and just fit it in everyone's lives and everyone's diets.
BULL23|But pondering some research, it is found that beyond meat is actually overvalued right now.
NEUT24|I believe it's stock is at $76.
NEUT25|Unless it ain't already, but I think the correct value is around 40 to $42.
NEUT26|But I guess that would be the price target.
NEUT27|I don't know.
NEUT28|I think I might invest into myself forward the year of 2020 and this is just surface level thinking.
NEUT29|Not much research done into it, so don't take initiative to quickly.
NEUT30|I would suggest doing some more research anyways if you're watching this in 2021 and just being like oh oh is correct.
NEUT31|Well, what can I say?
NEUT32|Please hit the subscribe button.
NEUT33|And if you're watching this in 2021, knowing that beyond meat fell.
NEUT34|Wasn't for me.
BULL35|Alright, I hope you guys enjoyed that video.
NEUT36|I understand it was a little short, I just wanted to get my thoughts on the 2020 and how it'll go.
NEUT37|I do have another video coming up and it'll be reselling sneakers I think will be really interesting.
BULL38|"Hope you guys enjoy and have a good day."""
