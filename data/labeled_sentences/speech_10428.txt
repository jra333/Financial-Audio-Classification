NEUT0|"""Alright Jim, let's start with DoorDash."
NEUT1|You were just talking about it with Andrew and Becky and Joe.
NEUT2|Your point yesterday was great story, but be careful.
NEUT3|Well look, I think that there are a couple of things they are going in favor of it.
NEUT4|There are people who know the brand.
NEUT5|When people know the brand, the younger investors just say you know what get me some.
BEAR6|I don't want them to lose what discipline they have because then we're starting to get into a 1998, nineteen 99.
NEUT7|Where they put market orders in and whatever prices you get.
NEUT8|May end up being the top price for the day.
NEUT9|What I do think is important to people recognize that they're going to have easy comparisons for a little bit.
NEUT10|But then you know when people can start going out again.
NEUT11|They will choose to go out as much as they will use door dash.
NEUT12|I don't think board Dash goes away.
NEUT13|I think that it's more of a duopoly than it's been before because of Uber eats good business.
BULL14|Great business.
NEUT15|I don't know.
NEUT16|It is still a delivery system.
NEUT17|It still they've had to make a suburban.
BULL18|They've made suburban footprint, which is really brilliant.
BULL19|But David, in the end, we know that the mode is only as good as the fact that they have low prices and they've got good technology.
BULL20|Right now they've had very strong revenue growth, but to your point Jim, this may be a unique opportunity that they've seen over this last.
NEUT21|Let's call it nine months in terms of growth, and the comparisons will get tougher.
NEUT22|They've got to a year from now, and hopefully we're all back to sort of normal behavior.
BEAR23|And people are not staying home quite as often in ordering in quite as much.
BEAR24|You'd expect that that will reduce its going to trade it in multiple to revenues.
NEUT25|That is going to be double digits.
NEUT26|I'm worried about, you know, and I wonder how you view it from a valuation perspective.
NEUT27|Obviously great growth, huge market share 50% which you do also have to wonder how much bigger can you get than that, but look the one thing is certain Carl is that this newer brand of investors I've been profiling on May have money, have a lot of capital and a lot of people say where did it come from?
NEUT28|I don't want to even ask that.
NEUT29|I just say they like things and when they like things and they use things actually old.
NEUT30|Peter Lynch model from Magellan Fund for a long time infidelity.
NEUT31|They're willing to keep buying.
NEUT32|Look at, look at a snowflake.
NEUT33|I mean is it might speak to Frank Slootman.
NEUT34|He's not sure exactly who is.
NEUT35|Investors are betting there's a lot more retail investors.
NEUT36|DoorDash is used by a lot of younger people, both in the suburbs and in the cities.
BULL37|So I think that you're going to see incredible enthusiasm.
NEUT38|I wish that people would use limit orders, but that's that.
NEUT39|Is a parlance, Carl that they don't understand.
NEUT40|They don't get that, yeah?
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
