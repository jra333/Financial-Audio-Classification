NEUT0|"""Welcome back, it's the 20th of July, 2020."
NEUT1|Monday, the first day of the week.
NEUT2|So we've just done Bitcoin, Ethereum SRP, Bitcoin Cash Carano, because we changing Litecoin Binance coin and moving to crypto.com coin with vertical siaro coming in at #11.
NEUT3|So let's get straight into a CRL technical analysis.
NEUT4|So for CR against busy what's been happening, nothing much has been happening.
NEUT5|I feel like we already forming a double bearish divergance if you zoom in you will see that this is already a higher high higher high.
BEAR6|On the price, but a lower high under maybe a lower high under sorry Lower Normandy, lower high under RSI, so double bearish divergences.
BEAR7|Are we going to be collapsing from here?
NEUT8|Yes, no, I'm not entirely sure could we go higher?
BEAR9|Sure, of course we could go higher, but so crypto.com coin has been rising higher without a proper correction for the longest time ever.
BULL10|So we've been going higher and higher and higher.
BULL11|And you're already up 300% against BTC.
NEUT12|We've been defying gravity and so no matter what, no matter what, eventually everything will correct no matter what.
NEUT13|So be very very careful.
NEUT14|But going to a trip too soon.
NEUT15|Because we just don't know how much higher things are going to go if you did not buy siaro at the bottom here, I would not recommend buying at the top here, but of course it is your money.
NEUT16|So decision is your choice.
NEUT17|Now I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT18|I don't have any.
NEUT19|Define chauvinism, but my point is that you don't buy things when they're high.
NEUT20|He buy things when they are low.
NEUT21|Look for oversalt zones on the RSI bitings when they also wait until their overbought Denneny you sell it.
NEUT22|You don't buy high and sell low, so yeah, if you are if you bought it from the very bottom here so you have nothing to say but kudos.
BULL23|Absolutely good job and kudos to you.
NEUT24|This year against BTC, let me want to see our against USD T. But before that please give this video a like you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about the scenario in the comments below for Sierra against USD T we are rising as well, slowly rising.
BEAR25|I think we might rise slightly higher, we might drop, but I feel like we might rise slightly higher first before we drop back down.
NEUT26|So you feel like you know it is much more obvious against USD T there's already a double, double, double barishi.
NEUT27|If we were to.
NEUT28|Erase this week, right?
NEUT29|This is really a double bearish higher high on the price, but a lower high demand, low or high under RSI, so the double bearish convergence.
BULL30|You could see it on both pairs usdan because he so, which means that potentially a reversal could be coming.
NEUT31|So be very very careful about buying US euro at these high levels because you just don't know when things are going to reverse issue bitings when they're low, know by when they're high.
NEUT32|Buy low, sell high, not buy high, sell low doesn't work that way.
NEUT33|So if you buy high and if if if doesn't mean going to happen.
NEUT34|But if things start collapsing you will have to pay the price of time you have to wait for everything all the down moves first before it comes out.
NEUT35|Yeah it could take several months and even years before things reverse backup.
NEUT36|So there you go.
NEUT37|That's my take for crypto coin be very very careful about going to a trade tool soon.
NEUT38|Very overbought so if anything we would like to.
NEUT39|Preach caution, double bearish divergences everywhere.
NEUT40|An yeah be very very careful about going long.
NEUT41|At this point.
NEUT42|I don't know how much higher going to go, but I would not be with me.
NEUT43|I will not be buying anycrypto.com client at these areas.
NEUT44|Alright so I guess you say for myencrypted.com client technical analysis.
NEUT45|Thank you very much watching.
BULL46|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT47|"I can see you in the next video."""
