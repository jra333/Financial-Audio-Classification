NEUT0|"""You know, I'd love to have Nathan on to explain it more because it let's make sure that happens because Nathan is phenomenal."
NEUT1|He's able to kind of explain the mystery of mining in a way that is that is really accessible, and I think your audience would really enjoy a conversation with him.
NEUT2|Yeah, I just think the opportunity there is.
NEUT3|Like investors should take notice of the importance and impact this could have on on value, right?
NEUT4|I mean it doesn't take much like it takes, you know, one or two strikes on something and but you know it's having.
NEUT5|I think you've got right, right?
NEUT6|Like that's the essence of the reason why I believe in why I'm committing again and again to windfall is because I don't have to bat 1000, I don't.
NEUT7|I combat 250 and create a billion dollar company.
NEUT8|Yeah, right, so you know.
NEUT9|So this is something that is quite unique about the value proposition of Windfall.
NEUT10|If I were to just go and create my own, you know, say somebody showed up, you know counterparts.
NEUT11|One of my brokers and they say, hey, you know what your accredited investor we want you in this deal and it's a nickel deal or a copper deal.
NEUT12|Well, it either hits or it doesn't hit.
NEUT13|If it hits, I make money.
NEUT14|If it doesn't hit.
NEUT15|OK, my money's gone right and the nice thing about Windfall is I don't have that kind of risk.
NEUT16|You know, my goal is to as a as a shareholder is to, you know, make sure that I have.
NEUT17|Of course, doing a proper level of vetting, but I have like I get to go up to bat.
NEUT18|You know, 2-3 if I get 20 strikes, right?
NEUT19|Because you know, there's no three strikes for me, I get 20 and then I get to go up again next time I get 50.
NEUT20|It just depends on how fast my technology can process the data.
NEUT21|And how quickly my operational investment team can evaluate the project so that we can put together the right.
BULL22|"The Right business model to maximize value."""
