NEUT0|"""I wanna see what Netflix look like so."
BULL1|Right now this candle tells me that it's strong is going up.
NEUT2|But I want to see what previous structure looks like before I actually make the assumption so.
NEUT3|It looks like this.
NEUT4|It's closed right here.
NEUT5|Maybe reacting to.
NEUT6|The high is over here.
NEUT7|So.
BEAR8|Question is, is there going to be a drop 'cause right now it's looking like there's a possibility for it.
NEUT9|But before we actually say that we have to see.
NEUT10|Oh yeah, especially because of that reversal pen right here so.
NEUT11|He came near this I I wanna see how it's gonna react over the year.
NEUT12|And.
NEUT13|By the time he gets here, I want to know if it's going to break it.
NEUT14|So, but knowing that, especially if you're going to buy your.
NEUT15|Goal is to look for cheaper opportunities so all we can do is just wait at this point.
NEUT16|Oh wait, and before I continue everything in this video is strictly education.
NEUT17|All the information.
NEUT18|So if you decide to buy a stock or anything, trade it.
NEUT19|Invest or trade at your own risk, but right now to me.
NEUT20|It seems like.
NEUT21|It's either.
NEUT22|Consolidating like doing nothing at all.
BULL23|This is the retest after having tapping high three times and then.
NEUT24|With the confirmation of the RSI it looks like it's.
BEAR25|Almost completely oversold.
NEUT26|Anime 4.
NEUT27|So if we follow up with RSI, is saying.
NEUT28|There's maybe some room for drop right now.
NEUT29|And that's Netflix right now.
NEUT30|So we're how low can it actually get?
NEUT31|Will you look at?
NEUT32|Previous friend I would like to look at it around 380 Mark possibly.
NEUT33|But I would honestly with how strong the company is.
NEUT34|I wouldn't like gambled that low in less.
NEUT35|I actually see it so.
NEUT36|I would like to see 456 first.
NEUT37|I wanna see how it looks.
BULL38|Four 77456 personally, 'cause this is a great company.
NEUT39|Netflix is not bad at all.
NEUT40|They they really make their money, but especially throughout this pandemic, all they've been doing is just making money.
NEUT41|So with that in mind, you gotta be.
NEUT42|It's this one that you want to be careful on.
NEUT43|But if you're just buying shares, so it's just.
NEUT44|Waiting game anyways.
