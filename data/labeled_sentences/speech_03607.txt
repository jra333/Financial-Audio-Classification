NEUT0|"""Are there still places that you think this hasn't all been factored in already?"
NEUT1|Maybe some good places to put your money?
NEUT2|Yeah, this has been about two years in the making and so a lot of them did start to run with the elections last fall, and so yeah, there are still a couple that we think are interesting.
NEUT3|The Union Pacific is 1.
BULL4|They're going to haul all the materials and the supplies to wherever the project is AT and they would benefit not only from the volume but also from the fact that you know with all this anticipation they've been working on their efficiencies, so we should see good margin expansion with that.
BEAR5|But you and I was just going to say UNP has been on fire.
BULL6|That stock has really taken off and it seems to be operating very well just aside from any of the these funds that would flow in.
NEUT7|Right, yeah, it's run, but we still think there's more room to run another one along those lines is Komatsu and like the larger Caterpillar they're a very big manufacturer of heavy equipment, and they're also benefitting from the expansion that's going on over in China in the mining industry, so that's one that we still like, and a third one is one that's probably not on people's a lot of people's radar, and that's essential utilities, so this is not your coal fired, I.
NEUT8|Typical electric utility, like a Duke or a con Ed, that we'd stay away from.
NEUT9|Rather, this is wastewater treatment.
NEUT10|And there's $60 billion going toward pipes and wastewater treatment.
NEUT11|And there's just a lot of potential left in this name.
NEUT12|60% of their eBay Doc comes from wastewater management.
NEUT13|You said you'd avoid names like Duke Energy and Con Ed.
NEUT14|Why is that?
NEUT15|Yeah, they're more the cold, the old style I.
NEUT16|Electric generation and we're just looking toward renewables and and the wastewater management side of things.
NEUT17|Amarian, just in terms of things you might be on the lookout for things that you might be concerned about if you start to see this bill get eaten up a little bit in Congress.
NEUT18|If there's not agreement.
NEUT19|If the Democrats don't stay together in terms of what they plan to push through.
NEUT20|Yeah, I think it's more of a timing question than anything, so it'll give us the opportunity to go back and work on our spreadsheets.
NEUT21|But I do think the Democrats want to put some more social aspects into this bill and that may delay things for awhile.
NEUT22|That would be my biggest concern.
BEAR23|Is this is just going to drag on for a while.
NEUT24|Even if it does get passed, I think the plan is for some of this money to kind of dole out overtime too.
NEUT25|It's not necessarily going to be this flood of money that hits the market in these levels immediately.
BEAR26|Yeah, you know, the two point street, I'm sorry.
NEUT27|$2.3 trillion I, you know headline is very attractive and exciting, but the timing is really lengthy across many of these projects.
NEUT28|So it's I.
NEUT29|It's not something that we have to chase today, but those are three names that I think are good solid names to hold.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT31|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
