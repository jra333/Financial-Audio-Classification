BULL0|"""And now since the market closed on March 11th of the day, The Who declared COVID-19 a global pandemic, the S&P is up 34%, so it's Pfizer."
BEAR1|But other big Pharma covid developers like J&J, Astra, Zeneca and Merck are up much less.
BULL2|And Pfizer compared to Moderna is much less Moderna has soared.
NEUT3|Multiple of times it's like 500% or something here to talk about the pharma sector.
NEUT4|So Hardy analyst at CFR a vaccines cell have never been a big money maker.
NEUT5|I mean, it's a consistent business.
NEUT6|We've seen companies involved in the past, and that's initially what I think.
NEUT7|If you just try to draw the connect the dots to bottom line results someday versus vaccines.
NEUT8|And you use actual price to earnings multiples and all the things we use it.
BEAR9|It's tough.
NEUT10|It's tough to get that excited except maybe about Moderna that has a new platform for a lot of different medicines.
NEUT11|Is that what's happening?
BULL12|Hi good morning, thanks for having me.
NEUT13|So we think there are actually several factors that kind of came into play explaining why these stocks didn't move as much as expected.
NEUT14|We think that modern is a pure M RNA play and the main catalysts was the M RNA based vaccine.
BULL15|So it was clear to understand and invest compared to the other ones for Pfizer.
BULL16|We think lately we are seeing a good run in the stock but it take.
NEUT17|It took awhile also when you when you look at companies like Johnson and Johnson, Merck and Pfizer, those are big pharma companies that are more complex to valuate and there are a lot of different factors coming into play.
BEAR18|For example in Johnson and Johnson's case is other factors are impacting valuations such as lawsuits, opioid fairly lawsuit, stock related lawsuits, and now that we are over the elections.
BEAR19|There's also the high scrutiny about lower drug prices.
NEUT20|So all these also impact essentially.
NEUT21|The valuation of these big pharmaceutical companies.
NEUT22|So after we've seen the biggest.
NEUT23|After we've seen the initial high efficacy data, I've seen the more movements positively in these stocks would think.
NEUT24|There's not going to be a lot of pricing flexibility, either.
NEUT25|Is there not only from a public opinion perspective, but you're going to have you know, a huge group.
NEUT26|the US government, a huge body that's going to be negotiating prices for all these things, so I just don't see how not that this is about money for any of these companies.
NEUT27|'cause it's not just about money, but I don't.
NEUT28|I don't see how there comes a big payday based just on the COVID-19 vaccine.
NEUT29|That's a good point.
NEUT30|We also looked at how have the profitability was going to come into play for these companies.
NEUT31|And Johnson and Johnson and Astra Zeneca came up front saying that this was a nonprofit efforts.
NEUT32|We think this might be the case in the beginning, but we don't know a lot of things still about the COVID-19 virus.
NEUT33|Whether we will need to repeat vaccinations, whether similar to the flu vaccine, will need to be to have it every year.
BULL34|So there might be actually good profitability opportunities going forward.
NEUT35|We just don't have enough yet.
NEUT36|And we are thinking these companies might be looking into those opportunities for the future.
NEUT37|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT38|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
