BULL0|"""Good morning guys, doctor Boyce."
NEUT1|Watkins for the Black financial channel here I wanted to hop in real quick.
NEUT2|I'm still in Seattle but I wanted to give you a quick update in terms of what's going on in the stock market right now.
BULL3|The the markets doing really well today and it's and the momentum has been incredibly positive.
NEUT4|One thing that's interesting is the earnings season is coming up and a lot of companies are releasing their earnings and there's a lot of what they call information dispersion, meaning that the estimates of earnings are all over the place.
NEUT5|Nobody knows exactly what those.
NEUT6|Earnings are going to look like nobody knows what the trends are going to be.
NEUT7|So effectively what you're looking at is a situation where nobody quite is able to really predict what's going to happen and, but so far the information has been pretty good.
BULL8|There are updates from Pfizer and other companies on advancements toward a Corona virus vaccine, which is going to be huge and boosting the market it pump the market up a little bit.
BULL9|Disney has been getting some favorable reviews, basically, as people expect their earnings to recover.
NEUT10|But they are heavily dependent on parks which require issue which which run into issues with social distancing.
NEUT11|Things like that.
NEUT12|Also remember that ESPN is a big part of Disney and Live sports is taking a long time to come back.
BULL13|I believe that when it does come back you're going to see a boost in Disney.
NEUT14|That's my opinion.
NEUT15|That's what I like.
NEUT16|What else?
NEUT17|I also, you know Apple and you know things like that.
BULL18|Those companies have done well.
NEUT19|Tesla is hitting a new high and so as the earning season you'll approach is what we're finding is that companies are not giving any sort of guidance.
NEUT20|Or information for earnings for the for the rest of the year.
NEUT21|Or you know, for this quarter anything you know.
NEUT22|So it's going to be kind of a wild crazy ride.
NEUT23|A lot of volatility.
NEUT24|So just be ready for that.
NEUT25|You may want to step up your options game to invest in an option pricing strategy that will allow you to take advantage of the volatility.
