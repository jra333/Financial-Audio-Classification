NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for June 8, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm Celina, Nicholas, technical analyst at xm.com.
NEUT2|Today we will look at USD CAD on the daily chart.
BEAR3|So the US dollar versus Canadian dollar extended losses for 4th day on Wednesday, further retracing the up leg from one point 2460 to one point 3187.
NEUT4|The market is now testing the 61.8 Fibbonaci retracement level.
NEUT5|At one point 2738.
BEAR6|This is an important support level which, if broken to the downside, would accelerate a further decline towards the key 1.26 level.
BEAR7|If we look at momentum RSI, it's trending down.
BEAR8|It's in bearish territory below 50, so this suggests there is risk of further downside.
BEAR9|So if USD CAD continues on its downside and falls below 1.26, there is scope to reach the May 3rd low.
NEUT10|Or one point 2460 an.
NEUT11|This would result in 100% retracement of this May rally.
BEAR12|Consequently, the pair could see resumption of the longer term downtrend that started back at one point 4689, when prices kept falling until the low one point 2460.
NEUT13|So prices in order.
BULL14|If we saw a rise above several barriers to the upside, this would shift the bearish bias.
NEUT15|So to the upside there is resistance.
NEUT16|Now at the key 1.28 level above this we have the 50% Fibonacci level at one point 2024 and then above this we have the 50 day moving average that comes in around one point 2884 and then a successful break above 1.29.
NEUT17|Could see prices quickly rise towards 1.31 and then the main peak of one point 3187?
BULL18|"So thank you for watching and have a great day."""
