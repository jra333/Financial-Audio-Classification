NEUT0|"""David Winters Mountain Lakes, NJ shareholder."
NEUT1|I'm just wondering if there's an organizational model where you deal with the plethora of information so you can physically and intellectually organize it so you have your maximum output and retain focus.
NEUT2|And Secondly, if I may in the domestic soft drink business, is it winner take all?
NEUT3|I mean is there room for three competitors and?
NEUT4|Honestly, does Doctor Pepper have a future?
NEUT5|Yeah, I would say Doctor Pepper has a future out all answer the second one, but sure there's room for more than one.
BULL6|I think Cokes market share will go up.
NEUT7|Pretty much year after year, but not.
NEUT8|You know, we're talking tenths of a percent in that business, but tensive present are important.
NEUT9|The US market is what?
NEUT10|Must be 10 billion.
NEUT11|Cases so you know one percent 100,000,000 cases.
NEUT12|There will be that Doctor Pepper pills and a lot of people.
NEUT13|It's interesting how regional tastes can be.
NEUT14|I mean, a doctor.
NEUT15|Pepper will have a Sharon in Texas that's you know far higher than it will be in Minnesota or something, but.
NEUT16|But they're they're.
NEUT17|They're going there.
NEUT18|People are going to prefer it and and the interesting thing though is that the high percentage of people that.
BULL19|The preferred Cola, for example, although the Cola percentages have gone down a little bit, the fastest growing big beverage at Coca Sprite Sprite has had huge gains in.
NEUT20|In in sales it it does well over a billion cases a year an IT sells very well in a whole bunch of countries that.
NEUT21|So although.
NEUT22|You can make money.
NEUT23|With a soft drink company that doesn't dominate the business, you'll do a lot better with one that does dominate, but it's not a winner.
NEUT24|Take all.
NEUT25|It's not like that, like 2 newspapers.
NEUT26|In a town of 100,000 or 200,000, there are certain businesses that are winner take all that clearly.
NEUT27|But soft drinks are not one of them.
NEUT28|What was the first question?
NEUT29|Or the part about organizing?
NEUT30|I'm just wondering.
NEUT31|For those of us on the other side of the table, we get barrage with information and I'm wondering how.
NEUT32|How do you both.
NEUT33|Do you just re Daniels 10K's and talk to people and ignore everything else?
NEUT34|And how do you keep track of everything intellectually?
NEUT35|Well, we don't keep track of everything but but the beauty of to some extent of.
NEUT36|Valuating businesses large businesses that.
NEUT37|Yeah, it is all cumulative.
NEUT38|I mean if you if you started doing it 40 or so years ago.
NEUT39|You really have got a working knowledge of an awful lot of businesses, but there aren't that many to start with it.
NEUT40|Or you know.
NEUT41|And and you you can get a fix.
NEUT42|You know how much water there, 75 maybe or so important industries and you get to understand how they operate an.
NEUT43|You don't have to start over again every day and you don't have to consult a computer for anything like that, so.
NEUT44|It has the advantage of of.
NEUT45|Accumulation of useful information.
NEUT46|Overtime and.
NEUT47|You know you, you just add the incremental bit.
NEUT48|At some point you know why did we decide to buy Coca Cola 1988?
NEUT49|While that may have been, you know there's a couple of small incremental bits of information.
NEUT50|But that came into a mass that had been accumulated over over decades, and it's a very.
NEUT51|It's a great business.
NEUT52|That way it's why we like businesses don't change too much because the past is useful to us.
NEUT53|Try.
NEUT54|"I can't have a thing to them."""
