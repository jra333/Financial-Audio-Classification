NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|What time in the state?
NEUT5|The obvious, but I will anyway, just to establish some context here, but very very impressive bonds on the day when you think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here and then it was able to turn around and fight all the way back up.
NEUT6|Good solid move that does little more than valid question though of but is there any sort of true power behind this problem?
NEUT7|And is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT8|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward, and in my mind or falls on a single area, and that area is down here at the 125 Mark wise, 125 important and helpful and I'm not sending all this was going to happen.
NEUT11|But just for explanation sake, let's say the price would come down here.
NEUT12|Behave in that manner and then continue on down.
NEUT13|What would that be doing with the price?
NEUT14|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range of the chart where it just wasn't me not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT15|Now to be fair, no pricing, just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner and then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT16|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there you have that low down there.
NEUT17|If you envision each one of those steps.
NEUT18|Well now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
NEUT19|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL20|Overtime, it's going to make progress forward, and in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined again as 125 as far as areas of resistance are concern key battleground to watch moving forward.
NEUT21|Going to be right up there at the 128 mark.
NEUT22|So keep a close eye on 1/28 as the week plays out.
NEUT23|But All in all, any angle you look at it.
BULL24|Very impressive bonds today.
NEUT25|Not just the question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT26|Let's see what happens.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.

NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT33|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
