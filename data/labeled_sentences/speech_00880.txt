BULL0|"""We've got full team coverage of this Chaotic Market Day."
NEUT1|Carter Worth is running to break it down with the charts.
NEUT2|We've got canaccord's Tony Dwyer waiting in the wings as well.
NEUT3|Let's get first to Carter and the charts.
NEUT4|Carter so lots of things to look out of course, and lots going on.
NEUT5|But first, you really when things are in chaos.
NEUT6|Correlations often go to one and just to make that point not only today, but of course over the past year, look at the relationship between the NASDAQ and the S&P 500.
NEUT7|In fact, it's a correlation of about 95%.
NEUT8|What we do know, of course, is that one has more beta.
NEUT9|So the NASDAQ overshoots the NASDAQ, undershoots, the NASDAQ overshoots, but the trajectory, of course, is the same.
NEUT10|The straight down, the straight up, and what?
BEAR11|Guys talking about, of course, is the prospect of an important double top back to a difficult level.
NEUT12|Let's look at a few things, gapping.
NEUT13|It's very rare to gap meaning and indexes got so much news overnight, a tweet or a war, or could be anything swine flu that it gaps down or gaps up.
BEAR14|There have been a total of 79 times the past two years when the SNP is gapped up or gap down.
NEUT15|There are only three unfilled gaps and they're all below, so let's look at those levels, and it's a good reference point.
BEAR16|March 12 gap is still in play at 2784 March 11th, 2744, and of course, down at February 12th.
NEUT17|2718 from the peak of 2954 two were to fill that final gap.
BEAR18|We would have a sell off about 8%.
NEUT19|We know we're down to five now, so really just shows that's not a whole lot that would just be the beginning and then you could get the levels.
NEUT20|As guys suggested.
NEUT21|2650 for a 50% retracement in any event.
NEUT22|Here are those levels.
NEUT23|What we know is that the odds again, there were lines all along through here.
NEUT24|All of these gaps.
NEUT25|They've all been filled.
BULL26|These are the only three on remaining gaps that are filled and by all accounts I think we're going to swing down and catch those.
NEUT27|Take a look at the same thing on the NASDAQ.
NEUT28|There are three unfilled gaps.
BEAR29|Again, the betting is that we're going to come down and swing and catch those, and ultimately that would be a peak Prof. Decline of a minimum about 8%, and I think that's an important thing.
NEUT30|Now Apple, what do we know about Apple?
NEUT31|It peaked the same time the market peaked in September.
NEUT32|At bottom, the same time the market bottom Christmas, but what it could not do of course is it could never make it back to its high, so sort of feel.
BEAR33|It also dropped 40% from peak to trough twice as much as the market.
BEAR34|And not only could it not make it back to its high, it is a fairly textbook breaking trend, not good gap today.
NEUT35|Speaking of gaps, you can see it right there.
NEUT36|Apple is a place I would not want to be.
BULL37|"Alright, Carter, thank you for the charts."""
