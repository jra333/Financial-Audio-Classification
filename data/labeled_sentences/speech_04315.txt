NEUT0|"""First question we have."
NEUT1|Can you please have a look to reef not listed in token metrics.
NEUT2|It is a cross chain defined developed on Polka DOT and supported by Binance.
NEUT3|Can be the high risk Lambeau coin thanks.
NEUT4|OK Bill, could you look into reef REEF?
NEUT5|Let's see if we can do some tea on that.
NEUT6|That does look like a djent coin.
NEUT7|Alright, I'm pulling up my safari browser now.
NEUT8|It is coming right up.
NEUT9|OK, so here's reef.
NEUT10|OK, now this is the one hour chart, remember that.
NEUT11|OK, this is the one hour chart.
NEUT12|It's mid January.
NEUT13|Now to me this looks like a situation where.
NEUT14|A coin is kind of making a bottom, I believe.
NEUT15|There we go.
NEUT16|OK, it's loosely drawn, but we call this the Tea Cup and handle formation.
NEUT17|And again, this is a 30 minute chart, so be advised if you're watching this later.
NEUT18|Now, this formation has been a absolute money printing machine.
NEUT19|OK, it's a money printing machine.
NEUT20|Now, not investment advice.
BEAR21|Past performance in the indicative of future returns when we see this type of action, OK, if there's any sideways movement in reef and it starts to break above this point O2 level.
BEAR22|Then it came up because it was at .05 at one point.
NEUT23|Alright, and we have another saying on token metrics OK?
NEUT24|We say the bigger the base.
NEUT25|The higher into space.
NEUT26|Now again, this hasn't been around that long, but if we're looking at an intraday chart in mid January again, so bear with us if you're watching it later.
NEUT27|When these smaller coins when they make those bases right, when they go sideways once they start going up, you want to buy breakouts.
NEUT28|There's a difference between FOMO, which is buying it after it's up to 100%.
NEUT29|Versus buying it when it's up 10% and it's breaking out of range.
BULL30|So there's a lot of potential here in reef.
NEUT31|OK, you know, this could easily go back to five cents an if the whole polka dot ecosystem moons, right?
NEUT32|And there aren't a lot of, maybe polka dot related coins or coins that are like reef.
NEUT33|Then you know you could get a move to seven sets.
