NEUT0|"""Everyone is trying to find the next Bitcoin like investment."
NEUT1|In today's episode we will review a stock that has seen massive growth.
NEUT2|We will review healthier choices Management Corp, better known by its ticker symbol HCMC, will discuss why am I continue to go to the moon and also help you decide whether or not it's worth investing.
NEUT3|There's been a lot of hype around HCMC, but if you're not familiar, don't worry.
NEUT4|Here's a quick summary.
BULL5|Healthier choices.
NEUT6|Management Corp.
NEUT7|According to their website is a US based, publicly traded company specializing in providing consumers with healthy alternatives to everyday lifestyle choices.
NEUT8|They also hold patents that whole a primary focus on safer baking technology as well as synthetic or imitation nicotine compositions.
NEUT9|HCMC is the definition of a penny stock.
BULL10|In fact, despite its massive growth recently, it's still worth under a penny.
NEUT11|So how is massive growth still possible?
NEUT12|Let the professor explain for most of 2020, HCMC was trying out about 0.0001, in other words.
NEUT13|1% of a penny.
NEUT14|In 2021 the stock started to skyrocket and right now it's currently trading at .00425 or in other words, about 42% of a penny.
NEUT15|So what happened and why?
NEUT16|The major growth?
BEAR17|Well, back in November of 2028 CMC file a lawsuit against Morris International for infringement on one of their products.
NEUT18|Even though this happened in late 2020, the stock didn't start getting hyped up until early 2021.
BULL19|That was thanks to of course Reddit raising awareness on this matter.
NEUT20|Time to answer the most important question of the day.
NEUT21|Should you invest in HCMC?
NEUT22|Is it too late or what should I do?
NEUT23|I'll give you my opinion, just always take it with a grain of salt as I am not a financial advisor, nor can give legal investment advise.
NEUT24|But it is fair to say there's still potential to stomach money on this play.
NEUT25|Some specular stinks.
NEUT26|HCMC can hit $1.00.
NEUT27|There's even an analyst on Yahoo Finance that thinks they will hit $6, which would be insane because that would be over 10,000% gain from where it sits today.
BEAR28|If the lawsuit is a success and it's very realistic, the HCMC will skyrocket to at least a few cents.
NEUT29|Even if you were to buy HCMC today and it only went up to $0.05 per share, you would multiply your money by more than 10 times.
NEUT30|But just keep in mind that HCMC doesn't win this lawsuit.
BEAR31|The opposite will likely happen, and this stuff will probably plummet back down to 1% of us.
NEUT32|And so to protect yourself, you should only consider investing a small amount that you're willing to lose because invested in this company is pretty much gambling.
NEUT33|"Also, losses can take months or even years, so if you're looking for major gains, be ready to hold onto the stock for a while."""
