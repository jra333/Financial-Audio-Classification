NEUT3|But before that, I'll show you the stock of the week.
BULL4|This week I've selected Molson Coors Beverage Company, which recently secured the exclusive distribution rights for wrestling icon Dwayne the Rock.
NEUT5|Johnson's new premium energy drink.
NEUT6|With a market capitalization of nearly $10 billion and a total value of around $17 billion, Molson Coors is one of the largest brewery chains in the world.
BULL7|As we see here, Molson Coors has a solid growth rate of almost 5% over the last 20 years, despite the COVID-19 pandemic causing noticeable losses.
BULL8|Analysts are optimistic that the company will quickly return to growth once the pandemic is over.
BULL9|The risk analysis shows us that revenues have increased by over 170% in the last 10 years.
NEUT10|The margin by about 13% and the operating cash flow by about 95%.
BEAR11|At first glance only the issue of new shares appears negative, indicating dilution through capital increases in the past.
BEAR12|Currently, top graph shows a clear undervaluation of about 30%.
NEUT13|Therefore, I'll buy the stock now and hold it until the fair value at the blue line is reached again.
