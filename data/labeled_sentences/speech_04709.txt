NEUT0|"""Well, I think what stands out to me is the comps are incredible up high double digits."
NEUT1|When people were as Stephanie said we're looking for like high singles, low double digits.
NEUT2|But I think the key here is that different to the rest of retail.
BEAR3|Their store comps are down 17% because if you've been to the mall recently they give you like a cheesecake type of factory buzzer and tell you to go to the mall and wait two hours to be let in the store so they have a capacity problem as they are only allowing a very small number of people in the store.
NEUT4|That's different than a demand problem or or a traffic problem, so I think that's a big opportunity.
NEUT5|And second of all, Sarah there, finally offering larger sizes.
NEUT6|And that's probably one of the biggest opportunities not only to hit on line, but hit their in store shelves as the average U.S. consumer is a size 16 and until now they were really only offering up until size 12 with a few for teens mixed in.
NEUT7|Stacy, what was your take on the Mirror acquisition and will we see that?
NEUT8|Drive sales of the apparel?
NEUT9|Or is it just more of a sort of standalone business that could do well with some Lululemon branding?
BEAR10|Oh no.
NEUT11|Well, I think they'll they'll absolutely integrate it and use it as a tool to sell.
NEUT12|And I think what Lululemon is doing is building a Wellness health and Wellness ecosystem as so many brands are trying to do so.
NEUT13|I think it's incredibly strategic acquisition and it's a way to speak to your consumer in a different way and start to offer all different sorts of product lines.
NEUT14|You know, we've seen Lulu extend out in the last few years into different product, so I think you're going to see this company really evolve in terms of their offering overtime.
NEUT15|I wanted to just go back to the extending out into different sizes, theme that you just picked up on bigger bottoms.
NEUT16|Bigger bottom line idea that you sent out Stacy, which is how they talked about this.
NEUT17|Are they trying to go after a different consumer here?
NEUT18|An?
NEUT19|If so, does that consumer?
NEUT20|No, because it was.
NEUT21|Traditionally I mean really tight yoga pants, and I think even they've had prior founder has put his foot in his mouth saying that right?
NEUT22|So the old days where it was.
BEAR23|Scandalous to talk about larger women wearing a premium.
NEUT24|Brands of tight workout leggings, but that conversation is completely changed and I would say that Lulu perhaps was a little late to the game versus so many other brands like Arian, even Hollister that was really one of the first kind of forge ahead in it.
NEUT25|I chronically considering where they came from, so I think over the past year they have talked about it.
NEUT26|They did talk on the last conference call that they were introducing, size 20 and by the end of 2021.
NEUT27|It would really be rolled out.
NEUT28|Does the customer really know about it yet?
NEUT29|No, I mean it's really only shown up on the shelves in a small way in the last kind of three to six months.
NEUT30|And you know, our survey showed that there in stock this time last year on bigger sizes was about 2 to 4% of what we surveyed.
BULL31|Now it's up in the 40s and 50s, so that's going to make a difference.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
