NEUT2|Welcome back to another video guys.
NEUT3|In this video we're going to discuss if Facebook stock is a buy or not.
NEUT4|So basically Facebook.
BEAR5|Is one of the stocks that dipped within the past month and has dipped by 8% and.
NEUT6|At the top it was like 300 something 303 any price of Facebook below $250 is cheap as heck, so it's a great time to buy it as it's $249 right now.
NEUT7|Anna had a PE ratio of 30.45% with a 52 week range of 137 and 304.
NEUT8|And has a lot of people trading it.
NEUT9|Now let's get it.
NEUT10|Let's look at the analysis.
NEUT11|There are 42 idle analysts doing this.
BULL12|Sales growth this year was 11.7%.
NEUT13|And 20.
NEUT14|Like 20 between 24 to 27 of the analysts say it's a buy.
BULL15|And the past five years it has been growing 42% per year for the past five years, and the next five years is supposed to grow.
NEUT16|Can you point to 7%?
NEUT17|For that per year, for the next five years, and let's say you invest $100,000.
NEUT18|In Facebook and you monthly contributed $1000 and you waited for five years and the interest rate is?
NEUT19|20.27%.
NEUT20|In the next five years.
NEUT21|I'd like to see the variances too.
NEUT22|And let's calculate it.
NEUT23|Then you would have made 200 and $41,000.
NEUT24|You would have more than doubled the amount of money you would have initially invested.
NEUT25|"And."""
