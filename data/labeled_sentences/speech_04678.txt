BULL0|"""Hey guys this is a big one."
NEUT1|Jeff Wilkie.
NEUT2|He is currently the CEO of worldwide Consumer Plans to retire from Amazon in the first quarter of next year.
NEUT3|This is according to a filing that Amazon made to the SEC.
NEUT4|Dave Clark who is the senior VP Worldwide operations, will be succeeding him now.
NEUT5|Jeff Wilkie has been at the company for I believe more than two decades.
NEUT6|He's been described as only the second most important Jeff, of course, Jeff Bezos being the first one.
NEUT7|He is one of a handful of direct reports.
NEUT8|Two days I believe there's about 9:00 or 10 of them.
NEUT9|In his current role, he overseas many of Amazon's core businesses, including retail and operations.
NEUT10|The filing doesn't give a reason for the retirement, and I believe he is still relatively young, but there's no reason to believe that there's anything more to this than his retirement.
NEUT11|Jeff Bezos has done a good job of surrounding himself by veterans of the company, many who have been there for a very long time.
NEUT12|Dave Clark is one of them.
NEUT13|Who will be succeeding?
NEUT14|Willkie back to you guys.
NEUT15|Alright, dear, fascinating, but there's not an overstatement to say that this is an executive who one day might have been seen as a successor to Bezos himself.
BULL16|I think that's a really good point, Carl.
NEUT17|Though Bezos is still young, Wilkie was seen as the number 2, so it is interesting.
NEUT18|There are other people who could take that role, however, including Dave Clark.
NEUT19|And of course, there's Andy Jassy, who spearheaded a WS.
BEAR20|So there are a number of other candidates, although it is certainly a big loss for the company because he does overseas so many critical businesses.
NEUT21|"You can only imagine for someone who's been at Amazon that long, how much his stock options would be worth at this point and seen a tremendous runup in those decades that he was there."""
