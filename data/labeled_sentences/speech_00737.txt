NEUT2|Buy it, sell it.
NEUT3|What do I do?
BEAR4|It's going down.
BULL5|It's going up.
NEUT6|It's overvalued.
NEUT7|It's a car company.
NEUT8|Kathy would made a video a few days ago.
NEUT9|I think our new price target is $4000 in the next couple years.
NEUT10|You know what?
NEUT11|You have a Microsoft Apple, Amazon, early Days tech stock.
NEUT12|Here you have it.
NEUT13|It's here for the taking.
NEUT14|You don't have to really be a genius here.
NEUT15|Especially if you're young, take some money.

NEUT29|You're young, take 30% of your money.
NEUT30|Rule of thumb I think is about 10%.
BULL31|Even 5%.
NEUT32|Don't be conservative if you're young.
NEUT33|Take 30% of your money if you're aggressive and bullish, take as much of your money as you can.
NEUT34|In my opinion, put it in Tesla and within a year, even from right now March 18th, you're doubling your money.
