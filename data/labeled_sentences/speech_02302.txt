NEUT0|"""So from Crypto Gamer, curious about."
NEUT1|TA on Mana na na.
NEUT2|Only he gave us his own portfolio.
NEUT3|DNT and Civic today's after Coinbase lunch.
NEUT4|Where did DMT and Civic come from?
NEUT5|I heard of Mana already.
BULL6|Great work gentlemen.
NEUT7|Thank you quitter gamer.
NEUT8|Look at let's do matter Na na.
NEUT9|OK, I'm pulling that up now.
NEUT10|OK, so this is mana on Coinbase.
NEUT11|OK.
NEUT12|So.
NEUT13|Here's what I think is happening here.
BULL14|It looks like this was the point where everyone was like OK, everything's great.
NEUT15|No, it's not, and everyone gave up right and now every time it rushes up to this point everybody sells.
NEUT16|OK, so you can clearly see people unloading or trying to unload bags here.
NEUT17|OK, there's just one catch though.
NEUT18|It's not backing off.
NEUT19|This is a theme throughout the whole.
NEUT20|Experience tonight, right in other words, it doesn't back off.
NEUT21|People are selling, but there's someone there to take it from him.
NEUT22|Now I don't know if this is the greatest fundamental coin in the world.
NEUT23|I know it's been added to Coinbase, but when I look at this it makes me bullish crypto.
NEUT24|Now, if you know what this is and you've done your research and you like it.
NEUT25|Stay with it.
NEUT26|Even though it's at resistance, 'cause again, if the bull suddenly take over here, OK, all of these old coins are going to flip from, you know, Destroid an abandoned two.
NEUT27|Oh my God, I gotta have it.
NEUT28|So people are selling here.
NEUT29|You have to understand that.
NEUT30|But if the Bulls take it from him.
NEUT31|Right?
NEUT32|OK right here.
NEUT33|If it you know if it breaks through that that .09 area, it can really go up.
NEUT34|OK, so I don't want to be a moon boy, but I do want you to buy breakouts.
NEUT35|Right, so he was asking where did DNT and civic come from?
NEUT36|So those were 2017 ICS.
NEUT37|Actually I was an investor in both of them.
NEUT38|They've been around for awhile, I mean, but haven't really done much since 2017.
NEUT39|I'm surprised they even made made it up to Coinbase quite frankly, but I mean I made money on them.
NEUT40|Was almost everyone did.
NEUT41|If you sold and got out.
NEUT42|Within a reasonable timeframe prior to the.
NEUT43|Bear market in 2018.
BULL44|Well, that being said, I thank you for that cryptic gamer I think.
BULL45|Thank you for the kind words.
NEUT46|And yeah, tell us what you think.
NEUT47|"Are you bullish in manner or not?"""
