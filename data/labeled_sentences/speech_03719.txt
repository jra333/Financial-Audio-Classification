BULL0|"""Hi there, Jason Moser analyst with Motley Fool."
NEUT1|One thanks again for joining us for another edition of Ask a fool today we're taking a question from Caroline who asks were able to fool keep their emergency money in a time of low interest rates and Carol, I'm glad you asked this question.
NEUT2|I think it's one that we hear.
NEUT3|We hear this question a lot and I speak a lot of people.
NEUT4|They feel like they need to maximize the yield on virtually every dollar that they have.
NEUT5|You know when we're talking about investment dollars, that's fine.
NEUT6|However, in my opinion, you need to view emergency fund dollars very differently.
NEUT7|This is Money that's intended to be there for you as a safety net.
NEUT8|It's not.
NEUT9|It's there for you, it's there to take care of.
BEAR10|You should run into a problem.
NEUT11|So priority wise you need to make sure that first and foremost this money is liquid in available to you whenever you may need it.
NEUT12|If you have it invested at any instrument other than a savings account or a money market savings account, or even a short term CD, you're putting yourself in the position of possibly being a desperate seller, which let's face it, that's just not a good place to be.
NEUT13|One thing to keep in mind is that in time.
BULL14|Interest rates are going to start creeping back up.
NEUT15|They already are.
NEUT16|So take some solace in that at least.
NEUT17|But in any case, here just just remember your priority here is not yield its protection.
NEUT18|Make sure to keep that in mind.
NEUT19|Your yield in this case, when it comes to emergency funds is Peace of Mind, and there's no return in the stock market or otherwise that can really give you that.
NEUT20|So thanks for asking.
BULL21|The question is certainly appreciated.
BULL22|"I hope I've been helpful and For more information make sure to check out full com."""
