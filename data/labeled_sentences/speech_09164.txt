NEUT0|"""Time now for futures in focus, we're going to look at Bitcoin first."
BEAR1|The crypto currency pairing a drop after reaching all time highs from December 2017 joining us got power Prosper.
NEUT2|Trading Academy CEO.
NEUT3|Two questions.
NEUT4|Are you buying Bitcoin right now and what is it moving with?
NEUT5|So those are great questions, so I I think it's a difficult place right now in terms of just entering into a position, right?
BEAR6|We saw this big rejection off twice off of those all time highs which we haven't seen since 2017, but it has stabilized quite a bit here.
NEUT7|So it to me, from a technical standpoint, kind of in the middle of no man's land.
NEUT8|Here.
BEAR9|I'd like to see this personally drop back down to around the 1515 five level.
NEUT10|As an entry, I think up here again, it's kind of a crapshoot, but this this is really different Alex from the last time that we were up in 20,000.
NEUT11|You know three years ago.
NEUT12|Why is gold doing one thing and Bitcoin doing another?
NEUT13|Well, you have gold at as a trade that for the longest time was a.
NEUT14|You know the risk off sort of trade because of the virus, especially over the last.
NEUT15|You know nine months.
BEAR16|And now that that has really ebbed, at least there's you know optimism out there about some reopenings potentially bold has taken the brunt of that.
NEUT17|So people have, you know, really taken money off the table.
BULL18|In fact, there's been a record number of outflows from gold ETF's.
NEUT19|Over the last couple months, so are people selling gold to buy Bitcoin.
NEUT20|I don't know that that is the case here, but the the the acceptance Now a Bitcoin which may be coming into mainstream, you know we've seen it from PayPal.
NEUT21|We've seen it from square recently.
NEUT22|We just saw Guggenheim say that they're they're doing a half a billion dollar allocation in one of their new funds towards cryptocurrencies.
BULL23|So there's been a big adoption of Bitcoin, and I think that you may see some.
NEUT24|A little bit of rotation though, you know you really just can't compare the the gold to Bitcoin.
NEUT25|What they really stand for Scott real quick, like 30 seconds.
NEUT26|Do you like copper with higher yields?
NEUT27|You know what?
BULL28|Coppers been a great great play on reopening, especially out of Asia, and that's why we're seeing copper traded.
BULL29|You know, pretty close to the highs.
NEUT30|It's been since January of 2017, and and you may see people buying copper and selling goals in that play as well.
BULL31|"At least higher yields certainly help that out."""
