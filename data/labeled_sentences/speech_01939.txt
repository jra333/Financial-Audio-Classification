NEUT0|"""Welcome to charts that count, the Kingdom of stocks, is divided into 2 parts value and growth with value stocks."
NEUT1|You pay a reasonable price for a slice of a company 's profits value stocks in a word are cheap.
NEUT2|In this category today, for example, we find almost all banks and many industrials.
BULL3|With growth by contrast, you pay up for a slice of rapidly rising revenues or profits.
NEUT4|In this category, we typically find biotechnology software and hot retail stocks.
NEUT5|Now, as this chart from Star Capital shows, you've never had to pay more for growth relative to value than you do today.
NEUT6|Indeed, the differential in valuation was last this great or almost this great.
BEAR7|Back in 1999 justbeforethe.com bubble burst.
NEUT8|And as it was two decades ago, technology is leading the way.
NEUT9|Look at the price to earnings multiples of Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon.
NEUT10|Compared to that of the S&P 500, there really is no comparison.
NEUT11|But in other ways, the story is very different.
NEUT12|Today in 1999, the tech stocks that led the market were largely speculative.
BULL13|Now the leading companies have very high.
NEUT14|Almost monopoly like profits.
NEUT15|This chart from the Leuthold Group tells that story.
BULL16|Returns at the top quartile of American companies continue to rise steadily.
BEAR17|While returns at all, other companies are slowly slipping away.
BULL18|The stock market has staged a remarkable rally in recent weeks and has had a fantastic decade.
NEUT19|But ask yourself these two questions.
NEUT20|One, what does this extremely unequal distribution of profits say about the overall health of the American economy and two?
NEUT21|How long will it be before tax authorities or antitrust regulators step in to spoil the party at the most?
NEUT22|"Dominant companies."""
