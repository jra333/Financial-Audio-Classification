NEUT0|"""When you saw that number was that you do?"
NEUT1|Is that a call for a ski daddy or a booyah?
NEUT2|Or what was it when that three to hit?
NEUT3|It's just a good number.
BULL4|Marks was a good number in the country.
BEAR5|February was a week number in the country genuineness, weak economy bounce back.
NEUT6|It's very interesting when interest rates didn't do exactly what I thought they do.
NEUT7|Their lower I'd look I this is not an anomaly anomaly.
NEUT8|There's just some good things happening.
NEUT9|Economy.
BEAR10|I just don't want to maybe start hearing that the Fed has to tighten again, because I think that that's a mistake they already tightened.
NEUT11|We're not seeing interest rates go higher, and I think that what's happened is some people say that look this is just they were filling the pipeline ahead of the tariffs, but it's a good number and I think that you have to own it.
BULL12|Just a good number.
NEUT13|We should be saying, oh, it's a good number.
BULL14|It's a good number.

BULL23|She was a good month.
NEUT24|It was a really good rebound when people realize that we were not going to go into a Fed, let's say derive recession and people started hiring again and doing better an I think that look I. I think that as you and I both know, there's a resistance in coyan good number good how we just label it good and just say that's just what we want in the economy.
NEUT25|It hires a lot of people, produces a lot of a lot of well and you know I can't back away from that.
NEUT26|That's what it does show an, you know.
NEUT27|Maybe we ought to just kind of have some norms.
BULL28|"Where we accept that there's some good numbers and we don't look through."""
