NEUT0|"""Where to find value in global stock markets?"
NEUT1|I'm Jack cartereditorbarrons.com here with Oscar Schaffer, who is the chairman of Rivulet Capital.
NEUT2|And of course a member of the Barron's Roundtable.
NEUT3|So where are you finding value?
NEUT4|Well, the US stock market probably is the most expensive market in the world.
BEAR5|I'm not bearish in the stock market, but we found a lot of actual investment opportunities in Europe where people are down in the economy and it's not going to come back.
NEUT6|And we just think there's a lot of great companies that are overlooked in Europe.
NEUT7|It's always nice to fish where other people don't want to.
NEUT8|So can you name a few companies for sure?
NEUT9|Well, one of them was in Norway.
NEUT10|Actually a company called Orkla or Close the Consumer Products company that has a chairman that owns 20% of the company and over the past five or six years they diversified their cash flow into such logical businesses as solar and aluminum.
NEUT11|And he's come in and he sold or in the process of selling those consulting business.
NEUT12|Making the food business much more.
NEUT13|It's basically the Yuna lever in the Nestle of Norway, Sweden and Denmark.
BULL14|They have number one and #2 positions in food, pizza detergents and he's going to consolidate the business and make the earnings a lot more Ann.
NEUT15|Frankly, at some point a company like Nestle or Unilever who wants to enter that Norwegian Scandinavian market.
NEUT16|But I would hope by the company sounds a bit like a turn around.
NEUT17|Where is it in the turn around process?
NEUT18|These would be the asset.
NEUT19|Sales is 90% done.
NEUT20|Visa vie the turn around as far as earnings, it's probably 60% done, meaning I would give him another one or two years to fully turn it around and the stock is 45 kroner, Heels 5 1/2% so you're getting a decent yield while you wait an.
BEAR21|I think that this sluggish environment and food business in Europe is hurting them short term, but he's going to.
BULL22|It'll give him basically an excuse to layoff a lot of people, increase the earnings an eventually sell.
NEUT23|Interesting idea.
NEUT24|What else do you have for us?
NEUT25|Well, there's a company called Interaction which is in the data center business, basically.
NEUT26|Based in Europe, the reason it falls between the cracks is that it's a European company, but trades in the United States and what it is is that it basically is a real estate company that houses servers for communications or data, and it's that business is growing as companies like Morgan Stanley have too much air conditioning needs in their offices, they outsource it to companies like interaction.
BULL27|We think that's a great company too.
NEUT28|So is this the cloud or it's just really more of a warehouse?
NEUT29|No, no, it's a it's a warehouse utilizing the cloud.
NEUT30|Gotcha, can you give us one more pic?
BULL31|I'm pushing my luck.
NEUT32|No, you're not pitching.
NEUT33|I'll tell you what we visited about three months ago.
NEUT34|Comedy called Northgate.
NEUT35|Northgate is in northern England and they rent these large white vehicles.
NEUT36|They have a new CEO who spectacular the company almost went, broke about four years ago and did a big equity offering.
BULL37|This talk is going from £3.00 to about £5, but with the turn around in England and also they're very big in Spain, which is coming back from its its construction related disaster, we think that he's going to do a good job.
NEUT38|And people will recognize the value there, so could you do see eventually construction will pick up in Europe, but it's beginning.
NEUT39|Spanish construction is beginning to pick up, and the answer is yes, I do.
BULL40|Thanks very much.
BULL41|"Thank you."""
