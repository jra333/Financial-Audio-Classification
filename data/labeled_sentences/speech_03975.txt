NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, today we are going to discuss trading strategies using super trend."
NEUT1|How supergen can be used on a standalone basis and how it can be used in combination with other indicators like moving averages.
BEAR2|So now a very common problem faced by almost all intraday traders is that they are unaware of the indicators.
NEUT3|That works very well specifically for them.
NEUT4|However, if you ask me, the first indicator that comes to my mind with respect to intraday trading is Super Trend indicator simply because of its simplicity.
NEUT5|It can help generate very precise buy or sell signals in trending markets.
NEUT6|Now you must remember that this indicator is not very accurate or reliable.
NEUT7|For non trending markets or markets in consolidation mode.
NEUT8|So basically Super Trend is a trend following indicator, very similar to moving averages.
NEUT9|It is plotted on a price chart and the current trend can be easily determined by its placement with RV price.
NEUT10|So basically when we construct supertrain indicator, we just need two para meters.
NEUT11|And multiplier.
NEUT12|So when we are constructing this indicator, the default para meters are 10 for average true range and three force multiplier.
NEUT13|You need to remember that average true range plays a key role in super trend because a it helps us to compute its value B.
NEUT14|It provides us with the degree of price volatility.
NEUT15|Now the question is how do we identify, buy and sell signals where the buy sell signal can be easily identified when the indicator flips over the closing price?
NEUT16|See the buy signal is generated when super trend is below the closing price and it turns green in color.
NEUT17|On the other hand, cell signal is generated when the Super trend closes above the closing price and the indicator turns red in color.
NEUT18|Now I would like to remind you.
NEUT19|That no technical indicator gives 100% accurate signals and super trend is just one of them.
BEAR20|So Super trend obviously also gives false signals in non trending markets or choppy markets.
BULL21|However it gives lesser false signals as compared to other indicators.
NEUT22|Any technical indicator should be used in combination with other indicators.
NEUT23|So even super trends should be used with other indicators like MACD, D, parabolic, SCR.
NEUT24|"Or are you safe?"""
