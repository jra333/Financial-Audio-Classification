NEUT0|"""But let's squeeze in a mad dash."
NEUT1|Wanna hit WW E jet David?
NEUT2|I usually don't give you up an enigma here.
NEUT3|But this happens very rarely.
NEUT4|There are two Co presidents of WW member Vince McMahon runs is the CEO Jorge Berrios, Michelle Wilson.
NEUT5|I've had George Barris on a couple of times.
NEUT6|WW, unbelievable.
NEUT7|Streaming product.
NEUT8|They were very early, very early subscriber base training product took a little while to get traction.
BEAR9|Then when it did, it took off and so we just learned that they're both leaving effective immediately.
NEUT10|And McMahon says the change was necessary as we have different views on how.
NEUT11|Best to achieve our strategic priorities before that, barriers is the face of the company.
BEAR12|We have no explanation of why they're leaving, so the analysts are freaking out.
NEUT13|There freaking out, no one knows what to say or do and so this is what happens when you say nothing and just get rid of people we don't know.
BEAR14|So no ones coming in, no one supporting the stock, we just gotta downgrade.
NEUT15|Very logical.
BEAR16|Downgrade by Morgan Stanley saying listen there's a vacuum and senior management they they can't figure out sudden and fairly unfairly unexplained.
NEUT17|No one can figure out what's happening.
NEUT18|That's I haven't seen this happen in a long time.
BEAR19|We don't know, so if you want to wait in fine, but to me it sounds like something's very wrong.
BEAR20|Very wrong with the company that was doing quite well, yeah.
BEAR21|Well, it's losing 1/4 of its value right now.
NEUT22|I have no explanation for it, so I just put it out there.
BULL23|"I love to be able to say this is an opportunity, but this is this is about as opaque as against."""
