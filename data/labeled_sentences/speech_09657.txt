NEUT0|"""Welcome to trade a stock I purchased EP AM yesterday."
BEAR1|You can see the nice trendline coming up an since March has been basically consolidating ever since.
NEUT2|You do have a high here in a high here, so ideally if it breaks out out of these two, that would be a buy.
BULL3|I'm gonna be a little bit more riskier today.
BULL4|And it's hitting the 50 day moving average right here at 172 thirty three around that area.
NEUT5|So I purchased it hoping for it to either test 180 again or even go by.
NEUT6|Or even higher than 180 on the IBD, or is that it's over here?
NEUT7|So.
BULL8|So 97 EPS rating which is awesome and the Rs Ratings 92 so we're looking for this number to go up a little bit higher.
NEUT9|That would be awesome and you can see it's basically bouncing Office 50 moving average right here so let's keep it.
NEUT10|I on this.
NEUT11|I did purchase this today so I'm looking at either 180 or maybe a few 100 bucks and I'll probably sell it.
NEUT12|Alright.
