NEUT0|"""So everybody, it's Giacomo speaking."
NEUT1|Let's analyze together the states.
NEUT2|Let's talk in front of us.
NEUT3|There is one hour candle stick in, just using simple tools of technical analysis.
NEUT4|Let's see if we can forecast the price movement or the next step of this stock.
NEUT5|So the idea first of all, just without my technical analysis interpretation, this is how the stock looks like and using exponential moving average that.
NEUT6|Generally it works as support for bottoms for throats.
NEUT7|He work at this point in work.
NEUT8|At this point worked on approximately.
NEUT9|There you just need to play a little bit with the length of these these exponential moving average, but as we can see it's nice straight line, but it's a line inclined a little bit toward upward end, so this inclination or this line is just showing us that the trend is bullish trend, so the prices are going.
NEUT10|Upward and to support it, Edit is an amazing trendline with this red trendline that shows us the date that the stock really is going upwards.
NEUT11|So in this situation, where the market is a bullish market, the idea is to follow.
NEUT12|Try to follow the target.
NEUT13|Try to fold a major trend.
NEUT14|The major trend in this case is bullish market.
NEUT15|So the idea is to go long to support these technical analysis idea.
NEUT16|That is, the fundamental analyst is fundamental news.
NEUT17|Always fundamental news is taken technical analysis.
BULL18|They should be on the same page and fundamental analysis is just suggesting that Goldman Sachs is upgraded.
NEUT19|Its prices price tag is there is price target to four and 50 when it was 400 before and there's already reached 450 and this keep going in its keep going upward well.
NEUT20|Perhaps the next target price.
NEUT21|Up to 500 U.S. dollar.
NEUT22|So the idea is to go longer because this talk is is going is performing very well so it's tried to follow the market, the bullish market.
NEUT23|So that is to go longer.
NEUT24|Even if as we are right now, I'm still awaiting for kind of price retracement.
NEUT25|That is not open yet.
NEUT26|So perhaps really this talk and go down before going up.
NEUT27|So my concern is or is a?
NEUT28|"Possible price retracement before going up before reaching before breaking the 500 U.S. dollar limit so the idea is to based on fundamental technologies always go long as published market but please be aware that the prices can go down anytime because to complete this target price thanks bye."""
