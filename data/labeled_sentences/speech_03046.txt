BULL0|"""Hello everybody."
NEUT1|Hi it's me Jack him again for this quick update on Facebook.
NEUT2|I'm going to give you updates this evening and afternoon evening.
NEUT3|I'm going to give some updates on the measure stocks that are part of the SP 500 index.
NEUT4|So first one is Facebook.
NEUT5|Facebook.
NEUT6|As you can see from this one hour chart Candlestick chart is bullish market so bees and based on purely technical analysis and.
NEUT7|Following the trend, we should go in uptain.
NEUT8|So I mean we should go longer.
NEUT9|So actually as it is now based on the last week earning report and based on those taking analysis information where the the the trade is done is a bullish trend with an incremented speed because you can see that this trend line Doctor trend line is steeper than this one and this one it's even much steeper than this one, so it's it's again, it's a.
BEAR10|It's a stupid.
NEUT11|A uptrend, then one before you need that the market is moving very fast toward toward up upward.
NEUT12|The idea is that the target price first target price.
NEUT13|It's easy to be determined is just a projection of this.
NEUT14|This channel perhaps at the top at the break breakout point.
NEUT15|So there just to be on the safe side to to $215.00.
NEUT16|It seems more than reasonable and then.
NEUT17|And then, but just to let you know guys that the target price of 2020 $220 was before the virus.
NEUT18|So it's a lot.
BULL19|So it's going skiing in skin is gaining a lot actually gained already.
NEUT20|A lot is almost there, very tools before, let's say six months ago.
NEUT21|So Facebook is just dealing is, you know he's all stocks, revenue and forecast of six months because it's bad contract.
NEUT22|This is what I can read from fundamental analysis.
NEUT23|So it's a bullish market.
NEUT24|We should follow the train then it's technical analysis suggesting to go longer.
NEUT25|This is only reasons why.
BULL26|Oh yes, based on taking analysis, the market seems to go up along so, so that's it for now on Facebook.
NEUT27|Thanks for watching it and I'm gonna do other videos again on the Apple Amazon alphabet and my Microsoft.
NEUT28|Just because they are the the major.
NEUT29|With with Facebook, the major 5 stocks in SP 500 and then I will analyze the SCP 500.
