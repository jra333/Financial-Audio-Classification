BEAR0|"""The quote in the Journal today, John Hilsenrath the dollar is quote too strong an it's killing us."
NEUT1|Why is it being reported as dangerous?
NEUT2|Not just for the United States, but globally?
BEAR3|I think the American people have elected a man who understands business and our President elect understands that a strong dollar actually has a negative effect on American exports.
BEAR4|What sort of negative affect does a strong dollar have when our currency is more expensive than foreigners, have a harder time coming up with enough of their local currency to pay for your product, and then for the companies that do sell over there with, they want to bring back these profits denominated in.
NEUT5|Foreign currency when they bring him back into dollars, you're going to get fewer dollars for every unit of foreign currencies, so that makes sense.
NEUT6|A strong dollar is back for exports, but how might the possibility of new trade barriers come into play?
NEUT7|Could they help drive the dollar down when you erect trade barriers to keep out?
NEUT8|You know, BMW or Toyota?
NEUT9|Or you want to make their cars more expensive for US fires, so they're going to say oh, Chevy or Ford is much more of a bargain here.
BEAR10|You're going to restrict the flow of dollars to the outside world, thereby making them more scarce.
BULL11|More valuable, so trade barriers tend to increase the value of the currency along with interest rates and national power and prestige.
NEUT12|This is where there might be some confusion.
BEAR13|NAFTA is the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country, and now you want to approve Trans Pacific Partnership have a strong dollar is bad, dangerous even and trade bears will likely bolster its strength.
NEUT14|Might trade partnerships be part of the solution?
NEUT15|He's just signed an executive action announcing his intention to pull out of TPP.
NEUT16|That's the multinational.
BULL17|Trade agreement OK. Great thing for the American worker.
NEUT18|What we just did, but how do trade barriers play out in the marketplace, particularly with respect to the American consumer?
NEUT19|You look at the Camry that were showing today.
NEUT20|You know that car has the most amount of domestic content of any vehicle made in the US.
BULL21|75% more than any other truck.
NEUT22|Any other car an it based on a back of the napkin calculation that car with.
BULL23|A border tax likely gets $1000 increase in cost.
NEUT24|Who will incur that cost?
NEUT25|The $1000.
NEUT26|We believe that that's not going to be able to be absorbed by the manufacturer has to get passed on to the marketplace.
BEAR27|In other words, the consumer and as a result of that, we think it's going to reduce demand.
NEUT28|For automobiles will have to adjust our production schedules.
BEAR29|It's going to have a negative impact on overall employment.
NEUT30|President Trump is promised to build airports, bridges, roads, tunnels, and everything else that would make our interest rates.
BULL31|Rise the Fed has been worried about deflation for the last decade and now where there may be starting to worry about inflation, so the Fed will want to raise rates.
NEUT32|President Trump wants the dollar to be lower, but you don't get a lower dollar with higher interest rates and faster growth.
NEUT33|"You know objects in motion like Newton said, tend to stay in motion."""
