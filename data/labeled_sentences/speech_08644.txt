BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Also from disclosure standpoint I do own Apple from the long side in my retirement accounts, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
NEUT6|Well, updates need to be done.
NEUT7|Did this analysis on Wednesday, but now that we have more data, the 1st update is just, you know, foundational technical analysis 101 which states when levels of support Whoops, I did not mean to do that.
NEUT8|Let's put that level back up there.
NEUT9|That was at one 12:50.
BEAR10|Bought 1 levels of support are broken an closed well.
NEUT11|They tend to act as resistance and you know it was technically broken and I talked about this in Wednesday's video.
NEUT12|It was temporarily broken there so the big question going in today was, you know, always at the sign of something bigger to the downside and yet absolutely was in the market.
NEUT13|Didn't waste anytime the price just flat out gap down this morning on Apple.
NEUT14|So one 1250.
NEUT15|The point here being that if there is any sort of attempted bounce back to the upside, that level will be the first big test for any sort of bounce an until you know the price can prove that it can get up above that level.
NEUT16|I mean I would look at any balance is basically a dead cat bounce and you gotta be sceptical.
NEUT17|Until again the price can prove itself and OK. Well, how are you defining?
NEUT18|Prove itself again 112?
NEUT19|Fifty?
NEUT20|Can the price not only get up to that level, but then be able to break above it and stay above it.
NEUT21|So that will be a very helpful level going forward, and then another update that needs to be done is just an adjustment.
NEUT22|And the question here becomes what direction does this adjustment needs to be made?
BEAR23|And now that we have more data it's become very clear that the newest area of support is actually down here at the 109 mark, and whenever levels of support need to be adjusted downwards now that doesn't mean that Apple is about to go down to $100.
NEUT24|But my point here is that if you're bullish, then yeah, you don't want to see levels of support needing to be adjusted lower and lower.
NEUT25|That's just not a sign of any sort of genuine strength or anything.
NEUT26|But yeah, very clearly, 109 is going to be a level that lots and lots of people are watching.
BULL27|I mean multiple times the price bounced off that level, so to give credit where credit is due, 109 is holding strong.
NEUT28|Can that continue to be the case going forward?
NEUT29|Let's see what happens with it on Friday 1st off.
BULL30|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT32|But it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you.
NEUT41|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live.
