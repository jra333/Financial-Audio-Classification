BULL1|More profitable and consistent successful trader.
BULL2|It's a great opportunity and I suggest you take advantage of it.
NEUT3|Sort of, take a look at the Facebook chart here.
BULL4|Beautiful uptrend here beautiful beautiful and today we bounced off of the 105 support as well as this uptrend line.
BULL5|OK really nice uptrend line.
NEUT6|As well as.
BULL7|Bullish engulfing the previous day.
BULL8|Previous days body OK so that's a nice bullish reversal sign right there.
NEUT9|If we can just keep writing up this uptrend line, that would be perfect.
NEUT10|This uptrend line needs to hold.
BULL11|It's a really nice angle and it's really nice trendline as you can see we've had several touches along that trend line six or seven in the past.
NEUT12|Six weeks or so, so really nice up.
NEUT13|Trendlines can ride that all the way up.
NEUT14|I think we can tag the 1:10 highs sometime later in this week.
BULL15|But again, this uptrend line needs to hold, but so far it is looking pretty good for continued upside, specially with this bullish golfing candle right there on some decent volume when the rest of the market was having a pretty low volume day.
NEUT16|OK, so that's the analysis for Facebook.
BULL17|Thanks for watching.
