NEUT0|"""I'm Mark Herman and on this week's episode of Power up all be taking a look at what to expect from Apple this year and in the years to come."
NEUT1|If you're an Apple user, there's a lot to look forward to in 2021.
NEUT2|First, let's talk about the iPad.
NEUT3|The company is planning to announce a new iPad Pro in the coming months.
NEUT4|It looks similar to the current models, but adds a new mini LED screen to the larger version.
BULL5|That will make the tablet ever so slightly thicker, but the improvements will mean a brighter screen and far better contrast ratios.
BULL6|You can also expect a new processor that's on par with the M1 chip in the latest Max 5G, and of course better cameras.
NEUT7|You can also look forward to a thinner entry level iPad later in 2021.
NEUT8|Onto the Mac.
NEUT9|The company is planning major new versions of the MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, iMac and Mac Pro, all with in-house Apple Silicon chips.
NEUT10|You can expect the new Mac book Pros to launch around the middle of the year.
NEUT11|They'll have minor design changes but also removed the controversial touch bar.
NEUT12|Bring back the magnetic mag safe charger into the joy of Youtubers and photographers alike.
BEAR13|Also marked the return of the SD card slot, the Mac book Air will see a significant redesign going much thinner as early as the end of this year.
NEUT14|That laptop will also bring back the Magsafe charger.
BULL15|The IMAX will see their first full redesigns in nearly a decade, tored the end of this year, gaining a design similar to the $5000 pro display.
NEUT16|XDR, there's also a new Mac Pro in the works that's about half the size of the current model.
BULL17|Leveraging apples more power efficient chips.
NEUT18|You can also expect an updated Intel Mac Pro for users who need true Intel compatibility.
NEUT19|Of course, everyone wants to know about the new iPhones.
BULL20|Expect to line up in the fall.
NEUT21|It looks similar to the iPhone 12, but the possibility of an in screen fingerprint sensor is the major new feature.
BULL22|In addition to better cameras and faster chips, one should expect new Apple watches to launch around that time to further out in the pipeline.
NEUT23|Likely in 2022 is a mixed reality.
NEUT24|VR and AR headset that's pricey and focuses on gaming and communications much further out will be a pair of AR glasses that can overlay information like texts, Maps and notifications to the wearers.
NEUT25|Field of view.
NEUT26|And then there's the car.
NEUT27|Apple has a team working on car interiors, exteriors, batteries, and other technology.
NEUT28|But don't expect Tesla rival for at least another five years.
NEUT29|I'm mark Herman.
NEUT30|"This is power."""
