NEUT0|"""Let's talk about Apple Computer on a computer anymore."
BULL1|Apple you saw yesterday hit an all time record in terms of market cap and there they are today up about a half a percent.
BULL2|So adding to those gains.
NEUT3|Where did they go?
NEUT4|Yeah, this is such a weird story.
NEUT5|I gotta tell you so yesterday they got downgraded, right?
NEUT6|Who would they get downgraded by?
NEUT7|Wasn't JP Morgan wasn't City wasn't Goldman said?
NEUT8|Wasn't Goldman Sachs?
NEUT9|It was this research outfit called So we make sure I get this right.
NEUT10|Oracle Investment Research I run.
NEUT11|At first I thought I saw Oracle and I thought the company because no ones ever heard it.
NEUT12|Let's not kid ourselves.
NEUT13|Yes, no ones really ever heard of don't have a big reputation.
NEUT14|I guess until yesterday and so everyone learned about them.
NEUT15|But what was interesting though is that it just goes to show that, especially with a company like Apple with the stock at all time highs and it's it seems like it's such a momentum play, even though it's the biggest company in the US right now.
NEUT16|Such a momentum played specially at these levels, so we were watching history.
NEUT17|The stock opened higher so it was it kept making new highs again, and then you saw it on Twitter you saw people chatting about apples, downgraded apples, downgraded even though it was this company Oracle Investment Research who's that you know, still it generated some chatter.
NEUT18|And you saw it in the trading volume.
NEUT19|Message trading login was more than twice the average daily volume, so there was a lot of activity.
NEUT20|There was a lot of trading going around and the stock turned around.
BEAR21|Now in the grand scheme of things, 2% drop from the highs.
BEAR22|Not a lot and closed down 1%, but it had an impact.
NEUT23|Though Jeffrey generated a lot of chatter and you know, we'll see what happens next.
NEUT24|I mean, this company there big quote in the report was the hype concerns us, and I think that's really underscores what's going on right now.
NEUT25|There's so much hype about.
NEUT26|Around Apple, right?
BULL27|And look, their earnings growth is greater.
BULL28|Revenue growth is great.
NEUT29|The company's product you can.
NEUT30|You can make a case for buying Apple, but historically every company like Oracle, you never heard him right.
NEUT31|But every company that's ever been in the position apples in right there.
NEUT32|All time.
BULL33|Market cap leader.
BEAR34|Eventually they have faded from that position.
BEAR35|I mean, it doesn't mean they're gonna crash collapse, but eventually they have faded from that position.
NEUT36|So the question is 1.
NEUT37|Is that going to happen for Apple?
NEUT38|Is this the peak is the peak next year?
NEUT39|Is it the year after that?
NEUT40|I mean that's the big unknown of course and so.
NEUT41|You can look there several metrics based on valuation alone.
NEUT42|This company still looks relatively cheap, so who knows at this point.
BULL43|But I mean, I think that's a very telling sign.
BEAR44|The hype concerns us.
BEAR45|The hype has been there for quite awhile, and it still hasn't knocked the stock off, so I guess it could last for awhile, but that has to be.
NEUT46|If you are concerned about the stock, that's one of the it's unbelievable.
NEUT47|You can argue.
NEUT48|Is it really hype right here?
NEUT49|As much as people log this company, they beat estimates almost every single time.
NEUT50|It's unbelievable and we know that they're going to come out with the Apple.
NEUT51|5 September 12 that they will talk about the noyal blah blah blah, but we know they're going to come out with another new iPhone 5 new iPad or Apple TV.
NEUT52|These are all major product categories that if they really are going to keep innovating and really ramp up these new products.
NEUT53|I mean, who knows the story?
BEAR54|So depressing 'cause I have the iPhone 4S and I'm living on top right now.
NEUT55|I got the top.
NEUT56|It's not going to last much like perhaps Apple's position at the top of the world.
NEUT57|Writes like doesn't last.
NEUT58|Something new always comes along some shiny new thing.
NEUT59|Noise comes along all right?
NEUT60|Steve Russell.
NEUT61|"Let's get back to the blog where I will meet you in a few minutes."""
