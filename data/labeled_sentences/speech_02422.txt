BEAR0|"""Alright guys, time now to address your questions on the market, individual strategies to Mark is looking a little antsy here."
NEUT1|Always make sure you can ask me now Jay Island said hey, how do you view Disney as an investment?
BULL2|I viewed as an amazing investment.
NEUT3|One of these stocks that at the moment I don't think you ever sell their hitting on all cylinders and when something doesn't do well something else does well.
NEUT4|Listen don't think you could quibble about is where the stock is.
NEUT5|Anyone don't like anyone.
NEUT6|Don't like this and you don't like Disney.
BEAR7|The too much pressure over at ESPN that really drives the revenues.
NEUT8|I'm happy for their studio, that's excellent, but look at sports.
NEUT9|That's a problem, alright?
BULL10|Well, I have to say it's a valuable franchise.
BULL11|I can't talk about the stock today at today's price, but they have an excellent record number, wonderful portfolio of operations.
NEUT12|I spent most of the day not working today but watching the British Open on ESPN.
NEUT13|So I have to send bullish guys, take no more.
NEUT14|That's the name of the tweet Twitter handle and Twitter.
NEUT15|So what do you think about PayPal?
NEUT16|It just started trading broke off from eBay.
NEUT17|I'm not sure why eBay let them go, but I think PayPal is remarkable.
NEUT18|I'm not in it yet.
NEUT19|But it's something I will certainly look to buy any kind of dip.
NEUT20|Anyone not like PayPal, PayPal, everyone likes PayPal don't have a strong opinion.
BULL21|You have a strong pain.
NEUT22|What do you think about that?
BEAR23|Too early, pretty agnostic on PayPal.
NEUT24|I'd rather be in Disney then PayPal.
NEUT25|Alright Disney PayPal which one PayPal?
NEUT26|Any of the any of these pay social media, New World ways of exchanging Commerce go for it.
NEUT27|Alright guys email or lurtz IBM reporting mix a second quarter results not a beat.
BULL28|It be pretty good in the bottom line they beat by six cents and they were only short on the top line by a little bit.
NEUT29|Begali take a look at that.
BEAR30|The stock is getting absolutely hammered in the aftermarket, down 14% down well down a lot right now.
NEUT31|Here's the thing guys.
NEUT32|They've missed three of the last four quarters I happen to like IBM.
NEUT33|You know the street though, is expecting a lot from them.
NEUT34|And of course tomorrow at Speaking of earnings, we got Apple.
NEUT35|Let's talk a little bit about Apple because Apple's stock everyone is thinking about are you long Apple?
NEUT36|Do you like Apple?
NEUT37|I like Emma.
NEUT38|I'm not long in here.
NEUT39|It's interesting that Apple is really lagging tech and you don't see that very often right?
NEUT40|I mean typically if you look at Apple and the QQQ.
NEUT41|Same chart, not at all.
BEAR42|Lately, apples been unable to take out its spring highs while the NASDAQ has soared higher.
NEUT43|So I like it relative value.
NEUT44|I think that compared to some of the real high Flyers and on a fundamental basis, it's pretty cheap staining traditional valuation, metric web no matter what it is apples cheap, but that's been the story for five years and it feels like the street will never give it as just do.
NEUT45|Because Jim they can't do it.
NEUT46|They can keep it going.
NEUT47|That's the big thing that they have to continue to execute product.
NEUT48|They just everyone says they can't.
NEUT49|There's no way they can do it.
BULL50|So far, they've done that one trick Pony.
NEUT51|It's a 2 trick pony and said three pony.
NEUT52|There's No 4 tricks.
BEAR53|Our concern is that it's still a technology hardware playing at the end of the day, hardware usually sees the margins contract.
NEUT54|They have pricing pressure, but in the case of Apple it's cheap.
BULL55|Here I'd buy it even before earnings is going to do as well as we've seen.
NEUT56|Net rate of 55 million shares a day.
NEUT57|You normally trades around 4246 million shares.
NEUT58|Smartphone they made 4092% of profits as smartphone.
NEUT59|I mean, people are paying 6 almost 700 bucks for an iPhone when they can get an Android phone.
BULL60|Great smartphone for less than 200 bucks.
BULL61|That is amazing.
NEUT62|I don't know how long you keep that going, but that's something I paid for it.
NEUT63|Stay at no listen.
NEUT64|As I said, I think apples cheap.
NEUT65|I like it.
NEUT66|My worry about Apple is China, right?
BEAR67|A lot of Apple logs are really pinning their hopes on China.
NEUT68|The problems in China.
NEUT69|We've talked about a lot on this show.
BEAR70|The problems are intense, but innovation is very low in China too, right?
BULL71|But I think people are betting on future penetration is much higher than yeah.
NEUT72|If that China crashes.
NEUT73|Jim, I know you don't like to talk individual names and put a name like IBM that just you know feels like when I look at the headlines I didn't get a chance to delve into the numbers.
NEUT74|Looks like they said everything right, but the more they talked it further stuff the stock went down there trying to reinvent themselves, but they've done it a couple times throughout the history.
NEUT75|Yeah, I mean I I casually read it just as a layman and I didn't look so bad to me.
BULL76|"The parts that they were trying to re engineer grew nicely, right?"""
