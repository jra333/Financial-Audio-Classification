NEUT17|It should be always doing your own due diligence.
NEUT18|Let's take a look at the price fluctuation of anchor.
NEUT19|If you would have bought anchor anytime in 2019 or 2020, you will likely pay under 1 cent and for sure under $0.02 per coin.
NEUT20|As a matter of fact, if you would have purchased anchor on March 13, 2020 could have bought in for us low as 0.07 cents.
NEUT21|It wasn't really until 2021 that anchor began to skyrocket and very 2021 anchor rose to two cents, then three cents, then forces them $0.05 on March 26, 2021.

NEUT27|So where do you invite Anchor?
NEUT28|Corner Coinmarketcap you can purchase anchor on by ***** Wabi Kucoin and most recently anchor was also added to Coinbase.
NEUT29|It's important to note that Coinbase is the largest crypto exchange in North America.
BEAR30|This project has seen a crazy upside.
BEAR31|However, I think this growth is a little unsustainable.
NEUT32|Don't get me wrong, I think this one has a ton of room to grow, just not the insane way that it's been growing at.
NEUT33|So I'm going to be more conservative with my price prediction.
NEUT34|My end of the year Prediction is an anchor.
NEUT35|"We train at $0.40 on the lower end and $0.60 on the higher end."""
