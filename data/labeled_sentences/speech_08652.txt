BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on guys?"
NEUT1|This is going to be real quick video, but before that guys could go to hit that like button.
NEUT2|Look for 100 likes on the video and you guys can get some comments in the chat for binary genomics that be awesome, but there's a rumor that Binan Genomics will be having an offering very soon.
NEUT3|Let's go ahead and read the chart over here.
NEUT4|The RSI's are very important to take a look at some long term with this company.
BEAR5|So again in our side close to 70 means the stock is overbought close to 30 means it's oversold.
NEUT6|I'm going to be looking at the one month, three month and six months after this.
NEUT7|Rumor is going to look at sitting below 30 for almost all these charts for the one month and sitting at 18.
BEAR8|The RSI sitting at 23 for the three month and for the six months, sitting at 28, so below, oversold for all of them.
NEUT9|I'm going to be taking a position very soon below.
NEUT10|$7.00 is where I want to get in.
NEUT11|I don't have this rumor is going to be real or fake, but it's on the news tab for Rible, and that's why they recommend getting rible.
NEUT12|If you guys have already done so, make sure you guys go ahead, show me build my link down below, you guys get two free stocks for joining, but yes, really, really bad.
BEAR13|Over here, the Magni is looking like the stock could still fall a little bit, but I wouldn't rely too much on it, and since I'm long with the company, this just poses another buying opportunity.
BULL14|I wanted to go ahead and emphasize this that be NGO has been really good over there last quarter results we're going to talk about it right now.
NEUT15|Before that, if you guys were looking to get a position in, I would recommend getting in right now.
BEAR16|More down almost 20% for the day.
BEAR17|For the five days we have been were down close to 20%.
BEAR18|Also on the one month were also down a very significant amount, so I would really, really recommend getting in if you guys are trying to get a position, let's go ahead and look at their earnings here on Yahoo News.
BULL19|Earnings per share increased 82% year over year from a loss of $0.04, which beat the estimate of a loss of $0.05.
BULL20|They lost less money, which is a good thing.
BULL21|The revenue was close to $4 million, which is up 43% from the same.
NEUT22|It also be the estimate by $500,000, which is also a really good thing, and then they didn't give you any guidance in the call, but two good things over there.
NEUT23|Really happy to see that, and then it took a dump 20% today so you guys know how you have to move the market getting long term.
NEUT24|This could also be a potential swing trade, so if you're looking for that definitely look into that.
NEUT25|That said, BNG also got a recent buy rating by Oppenheimer, but before that, yes, the rumor is on we believe that they might may have an offering of $350 million, and this was by I forget which website, but so again, this is still a rumor, not completely published here.
NEUT26|I've been looking for other websites which confirmed this, but nothing so far.
NEUT27|Let's go ahead.
NEUT28|Read this article.
BULL29|Recent used to about 20 minutes ago, they got reaffirmed a rating by Oppenheimer for you by, and we get a lot of institutions are upgrading their ratings, according to Zacks Investment.
BULL30|They upgrade their rating from Asalta hold after the research report on the.
BULL31|28th of January, Maxim Group raised their objective price from $2.00 to $14.00 on the 22nd of Jan, an recently by an angioma says beat their earnings report estimates.
BULL32|So that's also a very good thing.
NEUT33|The consensus is a buy with a price target of 6.4 and B and Geo is reaching out right now.
NEUT34|So again, keep that in mind.
NEUT35|It's it's really solid by according to me, in the future of this company can easily hit 20 to $30.00, so that's just me long term about in a couple years I expect it to be at that price.
NEUT36|Guys, make a look here.
BEAR37|It's still trading down on Wednesday almost down.
BULL38|A dollar completely and it's done more actually now, so that's a really good thing.
NEUT39|I'm really good indicator for you to buy in my opinion, and offering can only mean good things for the future of the company.
NEUT40|For long term.
NEUT41|Definitely getting right now I'm going to be waiting till tomorrow to see this rumor plays out to be true and if it is I'm going to go ahead.
NEUT42|Jump in below $7.00, hopefully around six and a half.
NEUT43|That's where I want to get in again.
NEUT44|Keep in mind, in offering is not a bad thing necessarily.
NEUT45|That just means they're raising money for the future.
NEUT46|Maybe to acquire some company that's all had.
NEUT47|I'll see you guys in the next video in.
NEUT48|"Peace out."""
