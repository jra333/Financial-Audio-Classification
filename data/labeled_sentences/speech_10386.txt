NEUT0|"""We started testing people for coronavirus on this."
NEUT1|I know we still don't have enough test kits and we put the financial worries to rest creating confidence.
NEUT2|I think we can beat this and not have you lose all of your money at the same time, but sadly the only way to beat COVID-19 I believe is to risk a recession.
NEUT3|And I think after this week may already be in one.
NEUT4|We need to slow the spread of this virus and that means rules against gathering rules that make people stay home.
NEUT5|Rules that are very bad for business.
BULL6|That's why we need a massive federal intervention to keep businesses afloat.
NEUT7|Or see.
NEUT8|Our nation unravel financially right in front of us while we conquer COVID-19 if we're not careful, what can we do right?
NEUT9|First concrete, forget a payroll tax cut?
NEUT10|How about a wholesale postponement.
NEUT11|Postponement of federal taxation until the outbreak is over.
NEUT12|You can make up your back taxes after the virus is beaten.
NEUT13|Given that interest rates are incredibly low right now, will be easy for the Treasury Department to borrow a half a trillion dollars to keep the government funded.
NEUT14|In the interim.
NEUT15|I am mindful of what Senator Warren said.
NEUT16|We must at least do this though, for those in the middle class they'll spend it.
NEUT17|Which we.
NEUT18|Want the rich do not need this break.
NEUT19|They'll save it, she's right.
NEUT20|But the government can go without our money or anybody's money.
NEUT21|An our companies monies for awhile if they do that bond offering.
BEAR22|Second, the government needs to create a gigantic fund to provide interest free loans to small businesses if they agree to keep on their employees and give them paid sick leave through this downturn.
NEUT23|We need people were sick to stay home and that's the best way to stop the spread of this disease.
BEAR24|Third, large companies are furiously taking down the revolving credit facilities all at once.
BULL25|While the banks here are well capitalized, better than ever.
BEAR26|They still can't handle that kind of pressure.
NEUT27|We need government backstops to those loans, even guarantees.
NEUT28|So this coronavirus induced recession doesn't spark a financial crisis, so I know they're going to say Dodd Frank in this.
NEUT29|And that's classic.
NEUT30|That just gotta don't belittle or something right 4th.
BEAR31|The sudden decline in oil prices is a disaster for the oil industry.
BEAR32|Many producers are now flirting with bankruptcy.
NEUT33|We love lower oil prices consumers.
NEUT34|You and I both.
NEUT35|But America is now the largest oil producer on Earth and this industry does employ a lot of people.
NEUT36|So I think the government should use this opportunity to buy cheap.
NEUT37|Well for this Project Petroleum Reserve.
NEUT38|That would be maybe put a floor.
NEUT39|In worst case we end up with too much crude that we can sell at higher levels when the economy recovers, the President should go with that, even as I know he wants prices at the pump.
NEUT40|He wants to bargain for the government 5th.
NEUT41|The Federal Reserve needs to buy mortgage backed bonds, not charging mortgage back spike.
BEAR42|The incredible decline in long term Treasury yields the regular 30 year fixed mortgage housing budge.
BULL43|In fact, actually it actually went up in the last week.
NEUT44|You know, I gotta lower mortgage.
NEUT45|Several years ago, when the 30 year Treasury yields were much higher, if the Fed buys mortgage bonds well, then we can get those rates lower both.
BULL46|Enable boost the now flagging housing market.
