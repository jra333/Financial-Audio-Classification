NEUT7|Sure, most people have a Netflix.
BEAR8|I have a Netflix lately they've been quite lacking in the material and I'm going to count that against them because I'm on the fence as to whether or not I want to cancel my Netflix subscription.
NEUT9|I'm being honest here, alright.
NEUT10|So first up, let's take a look at the earnings growth over the last quarter.
