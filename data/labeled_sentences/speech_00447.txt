NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know that she would behave be back with another one."
NEUT1|Let's get right into it.
NEUT2|You know, like the waste nobody time before we do that, let's get this video.
NEUT3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they will be touching base on SND ill. That sundial growers we talked about this stock most times on the challenge so we can go too much in there.
NEUT4|We just give you all some reassurance letting y'all know what to expect.
BEAR5|Long term short term so it's crazy because I told you exactly where this stock will fall down to if we break these certain levels.
BEAR6|I said if we fall below $1.28 a dollar.
BEAR7|$0.30 We was falling down straight to the low $1.00 range to around 104105 and we hit 106 today.
NEUT8|That's crazy.
NEUT9|And I said, if we break that, that one affordable low one knows we going straight to $0.80 a share.
BULL10|But good thing we held up, we hit 106 right around that one or four and we held up and we held up and spike straight back up and closed around dollar and $0.20.
BULL11|So that was a good sign for this interview.
BEAR12|And I feel that was the bottom that was most definitely the bottom at 10 at 106.
NEUT13|That was the bottom on colony from here on out.
NEUT14|We might see another pool bit.
BEAR15|Of course you'll see intraday pullbacks.
BEAR16|You might see a pullback to around 1:15, one sixteen 113.
BEAR17|But from here on out this thing is most definitely awkward.
NEUT18|Momentum and bullish very, very, very bullish.
NEUT19|So you want to get in on this.
NEUT20|So let's talk about why resistance that what we gotta breakthrough before we see I need to let it go.
NEUT21|So if we look on the chart.
NEUT22|I next then let God will be 123.
NEUT23|We need to bust through that 123.
BULL24|We bust through $1.23.
NEUT25|This thing is gonna fly straight to 1:30 quick quickly once we get the 1:30.
BULL26|That would be another resistance and will fly up to 140.
NEUT27|And being you already know why main resistance that once we get up to 150.
NEUT28|We need a booster at 1:50 and reached 162 where we was previously at on March 15th and at 162 is a crucial point.
BULL29|Once we get the 162 right now is excellent prices to get in.
NEUT30|You most definitely want to be accumulating sundial growers shares.
NEUT31|I'm telling you so.
NEUT32|Once we get the 162 that will be our last breakthrough before we could fly.
NEUT33|Fly fly high straight to the $2.00 land will fly strongly the 208.
BEAR34|The 219 and 219 and be our last resistance before we can reach the 52 week high of 295 that we touched on February 10th.
NEUT35|So so that the sum it all looked sundial growers.
BEAR36|I think it bottomed out today we could see some more slight pull backs on the way up, but this thing is most definitely in a bullish momentum now starting tomorrow, Friday.
BULL37|Hopefully we can open up even higher and start just going up from there and come Monday.
NEUT38|It'll probably try to or come Friday would probably try to shake the tree again, pull back, pull back there, scared investors out.
NEUT39|So come Monday the markets open.
BEAR40|Note back big 'cause on Thursday which was today.
BULL41|We had a nice pull back.
BEAR42|The scary body out scare people out of their shares and then come Friday we possibly could see another pullback and then towards the end of the day we start seeing.
NEUT43|Everything start going green started going up 'cause come Monday.
BULL44|I feel like we're going to be a bullish market again.
NEUT45|Everything started going green so that's all I got for y'all.
NEUT46|This video I just want to give you a quick update on that.
NEUT47|Consider joining the family.
NEUT48|We post this type of stuff every single day and we love you all.
BULL49|"God bless y'all."""
