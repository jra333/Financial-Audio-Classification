BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to stocks with Superman dude."
NEUT1|Oh yeah, welcome back to the 100 top 100 series.
NEUT2|We are taking the top 100 most popular stocks, breaking him down, giving him a grade from zero to 10 based on nine key factors and it is time in alphabetical order for number 45 Coca Cola.
NEUT3|What do they do?
NEUT4|They make Coca Cola.
NEUT5|We like that we like that, but we don't need to look it up 'cause we know what Coca Cola does, right?
NEUT6|So let's take a look at their earnings Coke.
BEAR7|Coca Cola's been around a long time current quarter, down 2% next quarter, expected 31% positive current year, nine point, 7% positive next year 8.4% positive.
BULL8|Those are pretty decent looking numbers.
NEUT9|Keep in mind back end of the coronavirus.
NEUT10|Pretty good, let's look at the price target here.
NEUT11|Current price 5164 with a price target of 57.
NEUT12|Not too shabby, about 1011% from here.
NEUT13|That's not too bad.
NEUT14|Next year, let's take a look at the PE ratio.
NEUT15|If there is one.
NEUT16|Yes, 28.85 is not bad really.
NEUT17|We try to say under 15 is a nice price, but with the way stocks are right now in today's day and age, 28 is pretty darn good.
NEUT18|Then we'll be looking at the beta.
NEUT19|0.62 Anything under a one is considered low risk, so that's pretty darn good actually.
BULL20|And let's take a look at the short interest here and Coca Cola increased by 2%.
NEUT21|That's pretty nominal.
NEUT22|Not really very.
NEUT23|It's not really anything.
NEUT24|Taking a look at the chart now looking at little long term here.
NEUT25|Let's take a look at seven years.
NEUT26|Let's take it back about 7-8 years.
BULL27|Nice upward trend going on.
BEAR28|It was very overextended.
BEAR29|When Covid hit an covid, took it down from a $60.00 high all the way down to a $36 low.
BULL30|Now we've seen some pretty good recovery since then.
NEUT31|Let's take a look a little closer.
NEUT32|Just a little bit closer here, an we're kind of at the high end of our trading range with the low end and priority being at about 4860 a share 4860 shares about right all these points right here.
NEUT33|Along that line.
NEUT34|Let me just extend this just a little further and also.
NEUT35|But that's fine actually.
BULL36|There's a ton of a point around here that creates support and it just climbed up and kind of flirted with this resistance at 5230 and came back down.
BULL37|Overall, the chart looks good.
BULL38|I like it so the great I'm going to give on Coca-Cola given the fundamentals and everything else I'm going to give it an 8 out of 10.
NEUT39|I'm going to give it an 8 out of 10.
NEUT40|I like what I'm seeing.
NEUT41|I don't see a ton of growth.
NEUT42|Expanse potential, but I like to see that they're always coming up with new and interesting ways to sell their product, so Coca Cola let me know you're great in the comments.
BULL43|Thanks for watching.
NEUT44|Don't forget to leave a like and subscribe and we'll see you on the next one for Luvr #40.
NEUT45|"Six in alphabetical order, will see you there."""
