BEAR0|"""A snap of cold weather that has struck Europe in Asia is sent natural gas prices in those two regions of the world is our highest level in over six years."
BEAR1|However, the US price of natural gas remains relatively low by comparison.
BEAR2|Prices at Henry Hub have been trading at around 2:00 and a half dollars per Mmbtu in recent weeks, which to be fair, is significantly above levels from one year ago, but still far below peak levels from 2003 to 2000.
NEUT3|8 Now US up until 2016 was only exporting natural gas via pipeline to Canada and Mexico, but things have changed very dramatically in the past five years.
NEUT4|Currently anywhere from 3% to 7% of US production, depending on the month, is exported on oceangoing vessels, mainly going to Europe and Asia.
NEUT5|Sometimes the other parts of the world like Latin America.
BULL6|Now, given the rise in US LNG exports and the Sky high price of LNG exports.
NEUT7|Globally, why is it that the Henry Hub price hasn't reacted more well?
NEUT8|That seems to have a lot to do with demand conditions in North America.
BEAR9|With many restaurants, offices and other businesses shut down because of the pandemic.
BEAR10|Natural gas demand remains significantly below normal and we see that in natural gas storage levels which remain near seasonally adjusted record highs.
BULL11|However, this does raise a question with the advent of widespread vaccination programs in the United States and elsewhere, and in addition to that, also the possibility of additional fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus.
NEUT12|Could this eventually cause the price of Henry Hub to reconverge with the price in other markets around the world?
NEUT13|That remains an open question.
