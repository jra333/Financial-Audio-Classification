NEUT0|"""Let's unpack Walmart this morning."
BULL1|Bottom line, missed, but revenue was ahead up seven $400 billion quarter.
NEUT2|Not many companies do that.
BEAR3|David, I guess ecom up 69 is the slowest since Covid began.
BULL4|Prior quarter was up 80.
NEUT5|I wonder if that might be leaning on just the general idea that there may be some deceleration as we come out of the pandemic.
NEUT6|Yeah, that is a key question and you know what a comparison is going to look like as well as we sort of come out and people get out, although conceivably they'll just be going to the store that they perhaps are now buying things from.
BULL7|Remotely, so to speak, also focused, and I know we're going to be interested to hear from Mr. McMillan on their increase in the wage.
BULL8|Now remember, it's raising the associate average to above $15.00 an hour.
NEUT9|It's not raising the bottom.
NEUT10|I think it's still 11 Leslie dollars.
NEUT11|Now remember Amazon a couple of years back already went to 15 bucks an hour, but it is still significant.
NEUT12|And Carl, you well Remember Remember when you went down, I think and interviewed Mr McMillan a while back when they first started on that path towards raising wages.
NEUT13|That was the Seminole move.
NEUT14|Big move to start getting ahead of what became obviously a mainstream discussion.
NEUT15|Leslie about the minimum wage.
NEUT16|You know, the other thing that strikes me and David will remember this as well is whenever Walmart starts to talk about investments even from a position of financial strength, Street is often unkind in the beginning member that day, David.
NEUT17|We were wondering what was going on at post nine with the shares.
NEUT18|That was a big investment investor day.
NEUT19|That's right when they were upstairs at the end, and they also warned that day, I think as well, in part because of the.
NEUT20|Increased investments that we're making in the things that are now paying dividends, of course, Leslie, which is their ability to have operated during this pandemic and succeeded during it, because of course of having the infrastructure they needed in place to get things to people at their doorstep, or to have them come by and pick them up at the store without having to go inside.
BULL21|It proved to be obviously important, not just for their long term strategy, but shorter term given the unexpected consequences of the pandemic.
NEUT22|Yeah, and I'm just still thinking about the days that we could all be together.
NEUT23|A post nine seems like ancient history, but to your point, you know.
BEAR24|A lot of companies of course have been disclosing just how much of a hit they are taking on the bottom line as it relates to the costs of protect their employees and others against Covid.
NEUT25|For Walmart, it was $1.1 billion in the quarter.
BULL26|That's up from 600,000,000 in the third quarter.
NEUT27|So I think Amazon is somewhere along the lines of $4 billion.
NEUT28|These companies have to really shell out some cash an other intangibles as well.
NEUT29|It's not only just cash, but.
NEUT30|In order to make sure that they are protecting customers, protecting employees, all of that adds up overtime and and to Carl's point, you know whenever you start to see numbers like that and others SGA also higher during the quarter you know investors start to get a little spooked in it.
NEUT31|There's also this kind of sentiment right now where you see these these companies that have really benefited by staying open during the crisis.
NEUT32|You know as things start to return to normal as more people are vaccinated.
NEUT33|You know they do start to kind of take some money off of the table.
NEUT34|Investors take some money off the table for companies like this.
NEUT35|Yeah, bit of them do, but the Walton family doesn't and that of course Carl has been the key for Mr McMillan.
NEUT36|Is he been able to make long term decisions?
NEUT37|They're having a shareholder representing roughly 50% almost of your of your shares out.
NEUT38|I haven't checked lately, but it usually is around there that gives you latitude.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
