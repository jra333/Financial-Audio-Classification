NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol Disp Disney."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're new to charts and not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link so you can go there and I'll explain in detail and then also from disclosure standpoint, I do own Disney in my retirement portfolio from the long side.
NEUT3|So just keep that in mind as I go.
NEUT4|Well, I don't mean to state the obvious or you know, but I'm going to anyways.
NEUT5|Absolutely Monster Monster moved today, not necessarily today.
NEUT6|More so this afternoon or I guess late morning, but when the news and all the headlines came out, you can see volume came pouring in and the price just obviously skyrocketed with it.
NEUT7|So that makes this a very interesting chart, not only from just the overall charting standpoint, but for a trading perspective.
NEUT8|Some interesting dynamics going on here, and I definitely trade this one today, and I will be looking to trade it potentially tomorrow.
NEUT9|So a lot of this is kind of just me talking out loud for myself.
NEUT10|In terms of levels of support and resistance that I'll be keeping an eye on, but the first key level of support that I find very interesting.
NEUT11|If there is some sort of pullback is right here at 146 fifty an you know the last part of the day.
NEUT12|This you know these candle sticks here are suggesting, you know, pull back could very well show up now.
NEUT13|No such thing as a guarantee and then also keep in mind pullback is not the same as reversal.
NEUT14|So when I say pull back, I don't mean it's going right back to where it started down here in the one 30s.
NEUT15|My point is it would not be shocked to see the price you know move down here a little bit.
NEUT16|So if it does then you know.
NEUT17|Like I said one 4650 I find is a very interesting level.
NEUT18|And then also from the support side of things, if there is a deeper pullback then right there at 144 is also a very interesting level.
NEUT19|So those would be the main levels that I'll be watching.
NEUT20|From the you know, the more so kind of near term level as far as very short short term areas.
NEUT21|Keep an eye on those levels right there.
NEUT22|'cause if the price can crack through there then you know a bunch of shorts or definitely watching that area and that could definitely create more of a self filling prophecy to get it down to those areas.
NEUT23|But those will be the main areas like set up support.
NEUT24|What about levels of resistance moving forward?
NEUT25|First level is nothing fancy other than right up there at that big old round Number of 150 an.
NEUT26|If the price can breakthrough there then I'm going to the daily timeframe 'cause the price is not been up this high for a very very long time.
NEUT27|And when I say that I mean we were talking.
NEUT28|As you see here, we were talking months.
NEUT29|We were talking years.
NEUT30|We're talking multiple years alright?
NEUT31|Well, at this point, yeah, at this point, maybe maybe it's at all time highs.
BULL32|Honestly, that this could be all time highs.
NEUT33|I guess I don't know that off the top.
NEUT34|My head point here being from the technical point of view, at this point, 150 is what I would call Blue Sky breakout.
NEUT35|So if the price can get above there then yeah, trade accordingly.
NEUT36|But anyway, look at it.
BULL37|Monster movement today, great volume.
BULL38|So let's see if the price can indeed break that round Number of 150.
