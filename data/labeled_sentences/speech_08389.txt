NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, overall the chart hanging hung in there.
NEUT5|You know there it's not like there was any sort of massive bullishness today, but there certainly wasn't any sort of mash of bearishness, just pretty much a neutral day.
NEUT6|Now 120 is still that overall important level of support.
NEUT7|I'm not going to go over why that's an important area.
NEUT8|You know, if you're curious, you can just go back, watch a video from Friday that I did.
NEUT9|But what I am curious now about moving forward is can the price actually maintain above this area of support that was established today, right there at one 2075 to which I would call the ideal level meaning for Tasklet won't make this chart look the best moving forward.
NEUT10|One 2075 would be a fantastic sign of strength, with all that being said, if the price does actually breakdown through one 2075, that doesn't mean that everything is all of a sudden destroyed and ruined or anything like that.
BULL11|But yeah, the price could actually stay above that level.
BULL12|That would certainly be a good step in the right direction, but like I said, if it doesn't hold up.
NEUT13|Then the 120 mark down there going to be a much more important area of support, so keep it on those couple levels and then as far as levels of resistance are concerned, the main level here.
BULL14|But I think you know has done a good job of being just reiterated.
BULL15|After today's price went right up there, give or take around $122, I realized that right there the price actually got up above it.
NEUT16|But then in instances like this and this price didn't quite hit it.
NEUT17|So we kind of just finding a common ground there.
NEUT18|122 looks to be that main area of resistance to watch moving forward.
NEUT19|So in the very near term 122 resistance and then one 2075 that key level of support.
NEUT20|But just a nice little sideways channel here form little day of consolidation.
NEUT21|The good news is it's only Monday so still plenty of time left on the week.
NEUT22|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT23|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT24|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT25|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL26|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird.
NEUT28|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT29|But in a cruel way.
BEAR30|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT33|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT34|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT35|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT36|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
