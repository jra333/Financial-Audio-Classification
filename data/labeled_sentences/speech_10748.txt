BULL0|"""Sales at Lowe's are booming thanks to record low borrowing rates that Americans have been taking advantage of to redo their homes."
NEUT1|But is Lowe's a stock you want to own moving forward?
BULL2|After all of these success it had in 2020, did you know that the home improvement retailer has posted double digit profit growth in the last five quarters?
BULL3|Lowe's also sees their total sales increasing around 22% after they withdrew their guidance in May of 2020, but there is a concern that consumers will stop fixing up their homes.
NEUT4|And instead start spending more time outside of their homes.
NEUT5|Now that we have a couple covid vaccines that are becoming widely available.
BEAR6|However, growth is expected to take a breather in 2021 as Wall Street sees EPS around 5% to $9.12, as well as a revenue decline of about 3.5% to 85.4 billion.
BULL7|But shares actually soared 30% in 2020.
NEUT8|Mind you, I could probably count the number of stocks on my hand that didn't go up in 2020 after March.
BEAR9|But I digress, because everyone was stuck at home and they were really bored in the middle of last year.
BULL10|Low stocks skyrocketed to its 52 week high of $180.00, and analysts also have a composite rating for Lowe's at a 93 out of 99.
NEUT11|And in order to stay relevant and not just solely on home improvement in terms of regular people, Lowe's has started to focus on contractors.
BULL12|So the professionals, Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison recently said this at a investor deck strategy will enhance customer engagement and grow market share by intensifying our focus.
BULL13|As for the Pro customer expanding our online business modernizing installation services, improving localization efforts, and elevating our product assortment.
BULL14|In December of 2020, Lowe's rolled out its growth plan titled Total Home, and the retailer hopes to double the revenue from professionals to 50%, which would bring the company on part to its rival Home Depot.
NEUT15|So is Lowe's accompany?
NEUT16|You should own moving forward.
NEUT17|Well, because I'm not a financial advisor, I can't make that decision.
BEAR18|For you, however, the 2020 housing market lifted Lowe's stock all time highs as well as its earnings, but growth is due to slow soon as costs are rising, as well as the fact that maybe this whole pandemic covid situation might wear off on people wanting to upgrade their homes.
NEUT19|As of August 2020, the stock has pretty much been trading in a range between 1:50 and like the upper 170 at the time of this video.
NEUT20|Lowe's is currently at 174 so it is at the top of that range.
NEUT21|What I would look for is if it breaks.
BULL22|Out above one 78179 or even if it gets past 180, there might be room for it to run because it has just broken out to all time highs.
BEAR23|However, if it does hit one 78179 and start coming down, it might be due for a pullback which could lead to a buying opportunity.
BULL24|Hopefully this short video was helpful as well as informative.
