NEUT0|"""What is your own guys fiber here in tambourine guys?"
NEUT1|Video on AMC.
NEUT2|I want to give you a recap of what happened today and give you guys some reason why you guys should be holding this stock right?
NEUT3|So AMC closed today at $9.36.
BEAR4|It's been getting beat down all week long so AMC short volume rate today was 22% as of April 1st.
NEUT5|The short shares available where 500,000 shares.
NEUT6|So AMC wants to issue 500,000,000 shares because they want to raise capital and a lot of investors.
BEAR7|I think overreacted and that is why I think the stock fell today a lot as adding 500,000,000 shares will dilute the price.
BULL8|It will give AMC more cash on hand, being able to open up more theaters an overall making the business grow even bigger.
BULL9|It doesn't sound good in the short term, but in the long run all the investors will be very happy with the progress they have made and the stock price would show for that in the future.
BULL10|Imagine once the pandemic is over, AMC movie theaters are going to open up at full capacity again.
BEAR11|We're going to see this stock price go crazy.
NEUT12|You guys also gotta remember that there's so many big institutions buying this stock.
NEUT13|Vanguard owns 7.6 million shares, BlackRock owns 5.9 million shares and they keep adding.
NEUT14|Which is a very good sign for retail investors as that means they might know something that we don't know far in quarter one.
BULL15|There have been $66 million worth of shares bought and $1,000,000 sold which is very good.
NEUT16|Institutions are loading up on AMC, they know something's coming.
NEUT17|The short squeeze is still possible to happen.
BULL18|I'm very confident I am holding this stock as you guys should too.
NEUT19|You guys gotta remember Covid really messed up the movie theater business, but once movie theaters are open 100% and AMC will be booming as they are the biggest movie theater company in America and I know a lot of people say that there's Netflix now and people really don't go to the movie theaters.
NEUT20|Going to the movie theater never gets old and something cool 'cause people get to get out of the house and once everyone gets their vaccines and movie theater start opening up, you guys are going to see a lot of people going out alright, so I'm going to show you guys the interview from CNBC as you guys can see here, AMC is asking for approval from shareholders to authorize 500,000,000 shares.
NEUT21|The shareholders will vote on May.
BULL22|Like I said, this could be a good thing as it made the Luther price.
BULL23|It could add opportunities to grow the company even more and bring more cash on hand.
NEUT24|This is not 100% thing and if the vote passes no they would not do this.
BULL25|As I see right here, they know it's an opportunity to bring in more cash and overall it will grow the company.
BULL26|If we Scroll down, the CEO said that the increase in vaccinations is a positive thing for AMC, as more movie theaters are opening in more, movies are releasing the CEO also said that Godzilla versus Kong had ten times the attendance of every other Wednesday so far in 2021, right?
NEUT27|So I pretty much wanted to give you guys an update on AMC and why you guys should be holding.
BULL28|I gave you some good reasons why dilution could be a good thing in AMC's case, but I hope you guys are holding this stock.
NEUT29|Once again, I'm not a financial advisor, so take this as entertainment me personally I am holding about 2300 shares of AMC and at the price that is at right now is a really good price to start adding on these dips.
BULL30|I do expect me to go up a lot in April.
NEUT31|Remember the short squeeze is still possible.
BULL32|I do believe it's going to happen anyways, hope you enjoyed the video.

NEUT34|Remember, we're holding AMC together and we're going to make this dog go to the moon very soon.
NEUT35|Piece.
NEUT36|Yeah, I don't know.
NEUT37|I know me.
NEUT38|I sure like I'm Kobe.
BULL39|"That boy really tough."""
