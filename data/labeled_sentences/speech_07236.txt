NEUT0|"""Let's talk about the Cup and handle pattern the Cup and handle pattern is a continuation pattern."
NEUT1|It was discovered in 1988 by William O'Neill from his book on How to Trade Stocks.
NEUT2|It's a great book.
NEUT3|There's a newer version out of it right now, so I highly recommend you get it.
NEUT4|Check it out.
NEUT5|Learn from it.
NEUT6|It's one of the few recommended books out there.
NEUT7|In either case, the Cup and handle pattern kind of looks like this so.
NEUT8|When you do the pattern, here's the Cup.
NEUT9|It goes here and here's the handle.
NEUT10|And then the stock goes kind of back up this way.
NEUT11|So the way it works is you normally have to have a previous trend or some kind of trend in order to have a continuation pattern.
NEUT12|So you have to have some kind of trend going upwards.
NEUT13|So here's your uptrend.
NEUT14|And then now what happens is there's becomes this retracement so the stock will go up and down, up and down, up and down right here.
NEUT15|It kind of hits this resistance line point right around that area.
NEUT16|And then it will trickle back down again to test to test a little bit of that resistance.
BEAR17|Now when it trickles back down, it's important to remember that this volume here will be slowly probably declining.
NEUT18|OK, but when it starts to break out, when it goes past this point right here and breaks to that upside.
NEUT19|When it breaks the handle part OK, here's our handle.
NEUT20|This is our Cup.
NEUT21|K when it breaks the handle piece right here, the volume needs to be there and it needs to be very high.
NEUT22|It's very important.
NEUT23|OK, 'cause it's got a breakthrough now on this which you gotta remember on this Cup is that this retracement right here needs to be a U shape, not a V shape like this but a U right here this U shape.
NEUT24|It's important to know that because of the shape is more of a double bottom or a double top.
NEUT25|So make sure to use shape and it's gradual.
NEUT26|It's about, let's say about a third.
NEUT27|Retracement from the previous trend from the previous uptrend.
NEUT28|So one third 2/3 and it goes back down just to re calibrate itself OK and then you have that volume spike, you would enter a new position right here or you would add to your position right there after a confirmation and then the trend would continue to continuation pattern and the handle can be.
NEUT29|A little bit different.
NEUT30|I mean the handle, can you know you can go down a little bit back up?
NEUT31|But the important thing to understand is that the handle goes down a little bit and then the Cup is kind of more you shape or more bowl like.
NEUT32|OK, so that's the Cup and handle pattern.
BULL33|I hope you found it useful.
