BULL0|"""Hey everyone, and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about SOS Limited guys.
NEUT2|This is a very hot, literally I can call it a penny stock in a way because a few days ago yes and see that literally.
BEAR3|It drops like $5 a little bit before it was like at $4.
NEUT4|And if you like this for the past three months, this was literally a penny stock that was like 1 dollars, $2.00 and then eventually it started to go off.
NEUT5|But before I continue guys, if you guys enjoy short video straight to the point like this, drop a like subscribe almost a pointer on those posts on ification's.
NEUT6|On top of that guys.
NEUT7|Don't forget to claim your free stocks here on Weibo.

NEUT13|So yes to see SOS limited manticora SOS yes and see how you know literally last month.
NEUT14|This is a very.
NEUT15|Hot penny stock and then yes and see how literally it dropped.
NEUT16|It would have literally 200% Ivy's don't know what this company is.
NEUT17|Always keep in mind that you want to invest in a company that you know what they do, how well they're performing an A company that you believe in.
NEUT18|OK, that's very important.
NEUT19|Never invest into a company that you have no idea what they do or what they are up to because you never know that company might drop and then it might get delisted and that's the end of it.
NEUT20|OK, so we can go over here.
NEUT21|Yeah, so see this is a holding company and it provides you know.
NEUT22|Pretty much marketing information has to do with technology and find solutions.
NEUT23|You know for emergency rescue services in China.
BEAR24|OK, so that's one thing is need to understand about this yes, and see that I would like around 200% But this past week it has been dropping Larry a little bit over 20% and if you guys don't know the market right now itself was dropping and continues to drop reason why is because of inflation?
NEUT25|Remember last year we were just printing out money, money, money.
NEUT26|We're doing all of these renal reliefs.
BEAR27|Packages and eventually it comes back, you know, and it bites the stock market right in the **** so let me know what do you think about this when the guessing it's still by yes and see that it dropped like at $5 and then after hours it goes up almost another 1011%.
NEUT28|So maybe people might hype it up and then people buy but let me know what you guys think about this, but I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT29|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys on my next video."""
