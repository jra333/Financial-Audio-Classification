BULL0|"""Good morning and Hello buddy, thanks for watching this quick video on business talk."
NEUT1|We are in front of us.
BEAR2|There is one hour candle stick and as we can see since middle of March those stock had been going upwards with a bullish market.
NEUT3|This is a tentative trendline, attentive becaused to draw a proper timeline, we need at least three points so we have only two.
NEUT4|So if this one it doesn't count.
NEUT5|If you want to consider this one's.
NEUT6|My daughter in this is part of the minor trained, but anyway, the idea is that to go along for sure with this name because he's bullish market by just all the little bit at the end of this price retracement.
NEUT7|Before going going up.
NEUT8|So the idea is to go along following the major trend by just wait.
NEUT9|Perhaps that this stochastic that it is in over oversold is just will start turning and perhaps this speak.
NEUT10|This bottom sore is gonna be somewhere there rather than being the.
NEUT11|At this level, should be something like 110, perhaps or even more one and 14 and 15 so, but I don't know that, so we don't know that.
NEUT12|So the idea is just to hold the end of this presentation before going along following the merger time.
NEUT13|So although for a while before going along so for long term investment we would like to go longer, but just hold a little bit more that even this fear or concerns around this second wave of coronavirus, there gonna be well.
NEUT14|Absorbed by the stocks when stocks are they got confidence or they were stopped.
BEAR15|All those news about the virus, I think that they will start going up.
NEUT16|So this is my understanding of the external situations or fundamental analysis.
NEUT17|It's always important to have an overview and over an overview and over understanding or global understanding of the market of the market and markets in general.
NEUT18|So I read a lot of news, even just not regarding this talk of violent political news or or.
NEUT19|Counter news or whatever.
NEUT20|Just get yourself very well informed and well updated on the economical point.
NEUT21|Economic point of view.
NEUT22|Sorry so.
NEUT23|So that's all from my side.
NEUT24|"Thanks bye."""
