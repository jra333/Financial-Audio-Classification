NEUT1|So further ado.
NEUT2|Please like comment, subscribe, put those publications on 'cause I do post every single day bringing you guys your shoe content.
NEUT3|So let's get right into it.
NEUT4|Here we have the Journal one mid white shadow.
NEUT5|So here is the Jordan one made white shadow in a size 10 pretty good size.
NEUT6|Retail was 115 on this pair an I paid about $121.90 after tax.
BULL7|Pretty cheap for a good shoe, good quality and good.
NEUT8|She released not too long ago.
NEUT9|Actually this pair is very similar to the Jordan 1 Mid Smoke Gray which is right around $300 almost every size now and that release back in June of 2020.
NEUT10|Bout six months ago and prices just went up for those very similar.
NEUT11|An that was like 150 bucks plus per shoe in six months.
NEUT12|So I think that's going to happen to this pair right now, right now, priced right around 4:00 or 1:40 to 1:50.
NEUT13|Easily see the shoe being $200 within next three months.
NEUT14|And then come summer time, same thing, just like the small greys right around 2:50 to 300.
NEUT15|Easy, my I picked this pair up at a mall this morning when I was picking up a pair of Jordan 11 jubilee's as a reservation winner Ann.
NEUT16|I saw these sitting actually so I was only allowed to grab one size since it was one per person for the store.
NEUT17|So I grabbed this size 10 and a half over the size 12 just 'cause it was a little smaller and prices were a little bit high on stock X about 10 bucks higher.
NEUT18|Nothing crazy but.
BULL19|10 a half would move better for me than a size 12 so I picked this pair up and I'm looking to pick up probably another 5 to 10 players.
BULL20|I am holding Jordan 1 Core Purple Lausanne band Mid so I am going to split it up a bit, try to get even amount for each colorway and yeah this pair will definitely go up.
BULL21|It's beautiful lot of people don't like mids but they are on the come up for 2021 and it will be a good ticket.
NEUT22|Anna easy.
NEUT23|Quick investment.
NEUT24|And you don't have to hold on like the Jordan one highs.
NEUT25|'cause they they are very populated and lot of meds are sitting.
NEUT26|You can easy pick him up.
NEUT27|Some malls are restocking them daily.
NEUT28|An easy to pick up retails really cheap so it won't hurt your packets that much first to Jordan high up close look.
NEUT29|Very cool cat.
NEUT30|Looks like the Jordan 1 shadow and a mix with the Jordan 1 smoke Gray.
NEUT31|Pretty cool.
NEUT32|I only suggest you invest into this pair if you do have the capital.
NEUT33|Again, I said before by 5 plus pairs to make it worth your time and money.
