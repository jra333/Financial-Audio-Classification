NEUT0|"""Good afternoon 2:07 PM."
NEUT1|Pacific Standard Time.
NEUT2|Date 7/6/2010 what I'm going to show here is a $450 call chart.
BULL3|And I'm going to show that $450 put which hit a peak over here of $24.00.
NEUT4|What I really want people to understand as far as the SMMT traders is that that high right there is lower.
BEAR5|So if this is going to lose value because the lows over here were $3 an 1/4.
BULL6|Jay made their peak.
NEUT7|And at the same time.
BEAR8|One that put option that 4:50 put option did that last week was a big week.
NEUT9|It started over here at a deflated price.
NEUT10|Well, when you look at both of them carefully, you can see where that call.
NEUT11|Option up here that 450 callboy.
NEUT12|Have they taken a lot of premium out of there 'cause they have?
NEUT13|And last week you can see the amount of selling that was in here.
NEUT14|K. And what we're going to be looking at is.
NEUT15|When we have a reversal.
NEUT16|Between inflated and deflated.
NEUT17|And as we look at it, because we know the SMM Tees are trained to be market makers because that's what they're doing, and that's how they're being trained.
BEAR18|So they already know that that was topping out over here at 60, and that was bottoming out.
NEUT19|So basically on that 4:50 put, you still made a big move, about $20.75 or so.
NEUT20|And if you had 10 contracts, that's 20 grand at the same time that was breaking out.
NEUT21|The 4:50 call.
BEAR22|They were taking extreme amount of premium out.
NEUT23|Look at the amount of premium here.
NEUT24|On this.
NEUT25|4:50 put see can see the move here.
NEUT26|And you can see the move over here.
NEUT27|"Both pay money."""
