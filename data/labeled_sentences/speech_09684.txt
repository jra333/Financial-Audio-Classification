NEUT0|"""Welcome back to Yahoo Finance on the move, Cole Porter said it best it is too darn hot and it's going to get a lot hotter."
NEUT1|We're expecting some record heat in the United States, so let's go to AccuWeather.
BULL2|Long range expert Paul Passalacqua is joining us from State College, PA. Good to see you Sir.
NEUT3|What can we expect more heat?
NEUT4|The forecast doesn't look like it wants to change anytime soon.
NEUT5|I I believe that we're going to see a lot of areas that are going to be experiencing heat, not just in the Northeast at times but also.
NEUT6|Across the Midwest and Plains and then starting to get into the Southwest a little bit more later on in the month.
NEUT7|And will this be record Breakers for July?
NEUT8|I think for some places it will, especially in the drier areas that you look at.
BEAR9|Parts of the Midwest already.
BEAR10|Chicago is seen about 6-5 or 690 degree days already and we haven't got into the heart of this summer season yet, so we're seeing a lot of heat building up in a lot of areas, getting dryer, dryer, it is hotter, it's going to get in some of those places, so I do feel that it's going to be the case, especially in the heart of the country.
NEUT11|Hey Paul, what does this mean?
NEUT12|I guess for people that you know are dealing with the effects of covid right now hospitals.
NEUT13|I mean, are we going to see a lot more people using air conditioning?
NEUT14|Just be 'cause they're not able to necessarily go out as they have been, and I guess what does that mean then?
NEUT15|For cities where you get that kind of furnace effect, having so many different people running their electricity, it's such high volumes.
BULL16|Yeah, I think that's going to be a big increase because of the expansion of the heat.
NEUT17|You're talking about.
NEUT18|New York City being in at times, you're talking about Chicago.
NEUT19|You talking about Minneapolis?
NEUT20|You're talking to big cities here that are going to be experiencing that increase in energy use.
NEUT21|Also, you're going to see you again like a lot of people indoors and air conditions.
NEUT22|I don't know how much circulation you're going to get out of that.
NEUT23|You want to be outdoors, but with 90 plus heat and then you factor in the humidity, it will feel like 100 degrees at times.
BEAR24|So you're going to see a lot more people going indoors, which is unfortunate in this situation.
NEUT25|You want to be outdoors during the Covid experience?
