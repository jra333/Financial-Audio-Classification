BULL1|Because it was up 20 times and it became a very large percentage of some accounts.
NEUT2|So I happen to own a million 100 and 15,000 shares.
NEUT3|Personally, I haven't sold a single share and I don't expect to for another 10 years.
NEUT4|And the reason we sold was a risk management idea where it became a very large percentage of two funds that I managed to focus funds they manage became over 50% of those funds assets, and I thought that risk mitigation was appropriate.
NEUT5|You know Elon has said that the autonomous driving.
NEUT6|Which he believes is going to be effective by the end of the year.
NEUT7|He thinks that alone is going to be worth 500 billion to a trillion dollars in 10 years.
NEUT8|Just the Thomas driving feature.
BULL9|The opportunity here.
NEUT10|"When I'm describing $2000 as a target price in 10 years, I think it could actually be more than that."""
