BEAR0|"""Liam, I know this is a high quality problem, but throughout I deal a lot of the auto companies."
NEUT1|Lot of different companies and they tell me look the one thing we don't have.
NEUT2|We do not have enough chips.
NEUT3|Does Liam Griffin's company Skyworks Solutions have enough chips to meet the incredible demand that we're seeing right now?
BULL4|Absolutely, you know, I'm glad you brought that up because our operational operations team did a fabulous job delivering that 1.5 billion in a 90 day quarter.
NEUT5|And the other thing that's important, Jim and I know that you get this.
NEUT6|We talked about it.
NEUT7|We are a company that that delivers technology internally.
NEUT8|We craft and configure our own devices in our own fats, leveraging high performance, temperature compensated filters, bulk acoustic wave, custom configured, gallium arsenide and miniature packaging.
BULL9|So we were able to bring that home.
BULL10|Within our own sites and really, for the most part, we've been able to mitigate some of the chip shortages that we're seeing globally.
BEAR11|Oh, that's good because a lot of the companies I'm talking bout saying they can't make it.
NEUT12|I want to be sure that it's not.
NEUT13|Scott works, it's the bottleneck.
NEUT14|It's clearly not now Liam.
NEUT15|There is a content.
NEUT16|There's this view on Wall Street that when anyone says it's early, it's usually late in the skeptics.
NEUT17|Just crushed me.
NEUT18|You and I have known each other for a long time.
NEUT19|You were continuing to, say, listen, 5G is at its infancy.
NEUT20|Give me some milestones.
NEUT21|It'll tell me why it's at its infancy and versus where it can go.
BULL22|Yeah, absolutely well, it certainly is at its infancy and we've waited a long time and we've made tremendous amount of investments in capital and people in R&D to be positioned to execute.
NEUT23|And we're doing that.
NEUT24|But the good news is, even in this great period of time with a great launch of 5G, we've only moved about 220,000,000 units of 5G phones.
NEUT25|If you look out by 2026, data from Ericsson shows that that number could be at least 3.5 billion.
BULL26|So you've got a tremendous tail here.
BULL27|And a tremendous lift that we have as we go forward.
NEUT28|A secular thematic move into 5G.
NEUT29|And it will be a multi multi year cycle.
