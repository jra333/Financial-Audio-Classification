BEAR0|"""Tesla shares are off just around 1% today, but over the past month it's been a clear winner."
BULL1|Well, it's been a clear winner.
BEAR2|I guess you can say for all of 2020 as you can see here on your screen today with the shares off, just around 1% at 6:32 a share.
NEUT3|Now the rally that we've seen though recently is comes ahead of the Tesla's inclusion in the SNP.
NEUT4|That of course takes place next week.
NEUT5|Emily McCormick is looking into this for us and Emily.
NEUT6|I think the big question here for investors is they're trying to figure out whether or not this rally that we've seen is going to continue after Tesla is added to the SMP.
NEUT7|That's right, China.
NEUT8|That is really the question here as we are in the final stretch of trading before Tesla joins the S&P 500.
NEUT9|We heard about a month ago that the company was going to be included in the index and with a market capitalization of more than $600 billion, Tesla is set to be the largest company ever added to the S&P 500 and the 6th largest company in the index.
NEUT10|Once it's actually added so that re balance is set to take place after market close on Friday and then trading with Tesla in the index will start on.
NEUT11|Monday after the opening Bell.
NEUT12|Now Tesla is replacing the company apartment investment and management in the S&P 500.
NEUT13|Inclusion does mean that Tesla will get more exposure to traders invested in index funds that are benchmarked to the S&P 500 an in anticipation of that that really had catalyzed this rally that we've seen in Tesla so far over the past couple of months, there's more than $4.6 trillion in assets index two at the S&P 500.
NEUT14|So as that company actually gets.
NEUT15|Add index fund managers are going to need to buy an estimated around $80 billion of Tesla stock and sell as much of that across other stocks already in the S&P 500 and Tesla is set to have a weighting of about 1% in the index, but again to your point about where the stock actually goes from.
NEUT16|Here we heard of course from Dan Ives of Wedbush that the China story the demand that's coming out of that country is going to be a linchpin here for Tesla going forward, the company of course opening.
NEUT17|The Shanghai Gigafactory earlier this year and continuing to produce model threes in that country, we of course have Giga Berlin on the way as well as a factory in Texas.
NEUT18|So a number of catalysts here upcoming for the stock.
NEUT19|There may be some volatility in the next couple of days ahead of inclusion, but of course we are always keeping our eyes on Tesla Shawna.
NEUT20|Alright, Emily McCormack, we certainly are.
BULL21|"Thanks so much for that."""
