NEUT0|"""And welcome to YouTube short today we give two calls."
BULL1|Thirty 3300 P. The money has been already doubled from 522.
NEUT2|It's 1100 high now or more than that and those who miss we gave them 32,800 P from 5:20 to 7:40 or even more.
BEAR3|So complete carnage is out there.
BEAR4|Banging FT has shown big failure right now.
BULL5|Very big folder and if you can see this is Thursday slow which is immediate support.
BEAR6|If bang Lefty bounce from here then it's summit may sustain here but if it does not and if it closed below this level.
NEUT7|Then we're heading for 31,300 or ultimately 30,500.
NEUT8|So if you want to add stocks, let's wait for some reversal, or else if you have view of 1 year, two year, or three year, then only you add some few, and for nifty it's heading for 14,350.
BEAR9|"The immediate support is around 14,500, and if that's broken then we're heading for 14,350."""
