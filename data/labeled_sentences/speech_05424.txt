BULL0|"""Enter unfamiliar with your research and you've made the case continually."
NEUT1|That fundamentals matter we all agree on that, but where you come out differently on this is that you think the fundamentals are shaping this market.
NEUT2|How so, Andrew?
BULL3|Yeah, so thanks and good morning.
BULL4|It's nice to be with you.
NEUT5|I think that what we see is that while it's very easy, I think to ascribe a lot of this summer's strength to, you know, easy central bank policy and continued easing globally.
BULL6|I do think of major story of the summer strength has been surprisingly strong.
BULL7|Economic data that surprised to really a historically elevated degree, and I think that means that continued strength of the data is really essential.
NEUT8|Going forward.
NEUT9|We were not simply, we can't simply coast on an expectation of.
NEUT10|That central banks will solve all problems and I think this is what makes the debate around US fiscal policy so important is that I think we're facing a really key decision point for how the economic growth in the US could look like going forward.
NEUT11|And we think that would matter for markets even if the Fed keeps policy easy.
NEUT12|Andrew sheets.
NEUT13|What does the decline in oil signal?
NEUT14|It seems to be the one statistic removed from all the gyrations of Fed central bank ECB fiscal in that.
NEUT15|What does Morgan Stanley say of $37 a barrel West TX intermediate?
NEUT16|Share the oil market I think is very interesting at the moment because I think what you see across commodities and you know I think this also goes back to the idea that fundamentals matter is that the supply dynamics really differ.
BULL17|You know you have very different supply dynamics and something like copper versus versus oil where I think the challenge that oil has is that as soon as you move up around $40 a barrel you have increased incentives for US shale producers to hedge, and it's probably harder for OPEC to continue to.
NEUT18|Push for its members.
BEAR19|Are you cutting supply?
NEUT20|Yeah, well this is important.
NEUT21|I don't mean to cut you off from the micro economics, it's brilliant, but are you suggesting loyal is not indicating global slowdown.
NEUT22|I I don't think so.
NEUT23|So I do think the supply issues are a major factor behind that, because a lot of the other economic data that we follow, the global PMI data, a lot of other global retail sales data that all still looks pretty good.
BULL24|"So we we still think the global economic picture is strong and that what's happening in oil is a bit more to do with some of the micro fundamentals of supply in that market."""
