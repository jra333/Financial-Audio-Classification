NEUT0|"""Joining us from Norway is one of the authors of that article."
NEUT1|Robin Wigglesworth.
NEUT2|Mike Santoli, joining the conversation to Robin's start with you, I mean, how much exactly were these positions in terms of size?
NEUT3|Are they up or down because of them, and are they still active at any insight on to those factors?
NEUT4|Well, we gather they spent $4 billion on call options with a nominal value around 30 billion.
NEUT5|So pretty sizable in mostly big US tech names.
NEUT6|Now, how active they still are, we don't know.
NEUT7|They could have sold those off.
NEUT8|Some of them might have expired, but we gather most of them expire in October, November, and December, so there's still probably still there.
NEUT9|Now it depends on when they bought them, how much money they made, I gather.
BULL10|That soft bank is still sitting pretty on a fairly sizable win on its tech investments this year, so I bet there hoping there hold on for them.
NEUT11|Given how the markets have been putting out these days.
NEUT12|And what's your take Robin as to why they did this?
BEAR13|I mean, apart from obviously thinking that these tech stocks were going to rise because it is clearly a step away from from what their typical type of businesses.
BEAR14|No, it's a huge departure.
NEUT15|And who knows what's going through their heads in doing this?
NEUT16|It's you, know, very different from making big investments in private companies being options trades in public markets is not exactly what SoftBank is known for now.
NEUT17|I mean, it could be just straight up that they think the market is going higher.
NEUT18|We want to own lots of tech and you know, we have money to put to work.
NEUT19|So let's do so.
NEUT20|There could be a somewhere somewhat more nuanced strategy here where they're doing something called the stock replacement trade, where they're actually.
NEUT21|Selling some of their underlying Holdings, taking profit on those, and then still keeping some upside exposure by replacing that stock with options.
NEUT22|And in that case it would be Delta neutral as the derivatives traders put it.
NEUT23|Right now we just don't know.
NEUT24|We just know they're really big there.
NEUT25|A whale in the NASDAQ market and how they play it from here is anyone's guess.
BEAR26|Given that Solomon SoftBank CEO, is not the most predictable person in the world.
NEUT27|Is the is a pretty unorthodox character?
NEUT28|And sure, this is not what SoftBank traditionally has done, but do we know if the Vision Fund allows the company to do this?
NEUT29|I mean, does the prospectus to investors say that they can invest on a short term basis in this way?
NEUT30|Or do you think the company is doing something more to untoward, to try to creatively plug losses from other investments?
NEUT31|Well, there's an important distinction there.
NEUT32|"Between the Vision Fund and a new asset management subsidiary that SoftBank was set up internally that is funded with SoftBank Money, investor money and some of Mafiosi son's own personal money and that seems to be where they're making these trades, not the Vision Fund itself, which is separate as you stay."""
