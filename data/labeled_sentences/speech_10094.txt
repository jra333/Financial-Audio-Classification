BULL0|"""While early going, it seems like investors are feeling pretty optimistic stocks moving higher."
BULL1|Our recent gains justified though, with the outlook for the economy.
NEUT2|We put that question and a few others to our next guest.
NEUT3|Fitzmier joins us.
NEUT4|He is senior market strategist at Invesco.
NEUT5|AIM Investors, advisors.
NEUT6|Rather, he is joining us from Bloomberg, Toronto studio Fritz.
BULL7|Glad to have you with us jobless claims number came in at 584 thousand, so that was higher than forecast.
NEUT8|But under that key 600,000 level that so many people said was important to get beneath.
NEUT9|So do you think we see stabilizing in the labor market or too early to make that call?
NEUT10|No, I think, well, I think this this data series unemployment claims is a very important one and the important aspect to this is the downward trending pattern his and now we've seen.
BEAR11|Probably six weeks of a downward trend in unemployment, claims that historically has been fairly effectively fairly accurately pinpointed.
NEUT12|The end of recession.
BEAR13|So the unemployment rate will very likely continue to rise.
BEAR14|But unemployment claims probably signify that we're exiting recession and back into recovery.
NEUT15|So what does that mean then?
NEUT16|For example, for?
BEAR17|Third quarter GDP, I mean most economists about a month or two were looking for just marginal growth.
NEUT18|Do you think we can be more optimistic?
NEUT19|Yeah, what's interesting is most recently many economists actually are taking up their GDP forecast for the third quarter, just slightly the consensus until recently was about .9 or 1% GDP growth estimated for the third quarter and now many of these of the best economists are taking that up towards 2%.
BULL20|That's a very positive favorable shift in sentiment.
NEUT21|What about some of the pretty big and qualified voices out there that are still mouthing caution?
NEUT22|Janet Yellen is one who comes to mind saying.
BEAR23|You know, even if there are encouraging signs, the economy could stay weak for a protracted.
NEUT24|She highlighted problems with commercial real estate, as did Sam Zell.
BEAR25|So I mean, there's still a lot of headwinds out there, are there not?
NEUT26|No question about it.
BEAR27|And yes, there are lots of headwinds.
BEAR28|I think most economists are in fact projecting or expecting a a muted recovery.
BEAR29|The consensus right now is for recovery to just 2.9% GDP growth one year out, and that by historic comparison would in fact be a very muted snapback from a depressed base.
NEUT30|But remember, too, that public officials really do need to sort of dampen their enthusiasm because I don't think anyone wants to see the Federal Reserve.
NEUT31|Take the monetary stimulus back too soon, and so that's part of the motivation there.
NEUT32|I would guess afritz.
NEUT33|I'm just curious.
NEUT34|I mean, how do you perceive the earnings season so far?
NEUT35|I mean, today we have more than 50 companies from the S&P 500 reporting results.
BEAR36|There are some who point out that earnings have looked pretty good in most cases, but it's because companies, either in some cases, understated tax rates or they just slashed and burned their way to better bottom lines.
BEAR37|In other words, revenue still moving lower.
NEUT38|What's your take on what you've seen so far?
BULL39|Right soft to very little to zero revenue growth, but better than expected profits.
NEUT40|And that's a pretty universal phenomenon.
BULL41|75% of companies that have reported so far have met or exceeded the estimates.
BULL42|That in itself is a very good statistic.
BULL43|Compares very favourably to historic data.
NEUT44|What I like, even if they're managing their earnings friends.
NEUT45|Sorry, even if companies could be accused of managing their balance sheets, managing their writings, right?
NEUT46|They they very definitely managing earnings through this software.
BULL47|But what's important here is that when we do get an increase in revenues with economic recovery, I think we're going to have a very strong profit snack snapback because companies have done so well managing costs through this downturn.
BULL48|Fritz, we thank you very much.
NEUT49|"For instance mayor there joining us from Invesco AIM Advisors."""
