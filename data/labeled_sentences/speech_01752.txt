BEAR0|"""In dollar valuation, now that is a far cry from rival match groups $45 billion market cap."
NEUT1|So what's unique about Bumble?
BULL2|Well first girl swipe 1st and the strategy does appear to be working.
BULL3|Wells Fargo analyst saying bumbles IPO could siphon some investor interest from Match Group, adding that paid user growth for Bumble's flagship was double that of match group Tinder through the end of last year.
NEUT4|For more on this space I'm joined by Todd Gordon of Trading Analysis.
NEUT5|Calm Quinn Tetreault of Joule Financial Todd.
NEUT6|I'm curious how you think the retail investor base will size up Bumble's IPO.
NEUT7|This is a company that is a consumer facing name and tends to aim tends to target millennials that are perhaps more inclined to online date.
NEUT8|Right, right?
NEUT9|So I'm a little out of this demographic, but I do understand that matches Tinder is the biggest competitor to Bumble.
NEUT10|Let's talk about match weather where that competition goes will see earnings last quarter from match where basically had expectations.
NEUT11|Tinder was a little bit of a drag.
BULL12|Batches and expensive stocks 62 times forward, earnings about 11 price.
NEUT13|The book I hold the stock I've held it for awhile like it.
BULL14|The chart looks great.
BULL15|It's testing upper channel resistance.
BULL16|I'm fully aware of that overhead resistance but there was a key acquisition with video which is going to be key in this.
NEUT17|New Age that we live in.
NEUT18|They bought a company called Hyper Connect with South Korean video for about 1.7 billion.
NEUT19|They expected closed next quarter.
BULL20|This is going to allow match to gain a bigger market share in Asia.
NEUT21|An list matches.
NEUT22|Is changes video world that we live in is changing societal norms?
NEUT23|These are how young people are meeting.
BEAR24|We're busy.
NEUT25|We're not out going to bars and restaurants as much anymore.
NEUT26|This is the way of the future, whether you like it or not.
NEUT27|So I hold it.
NEUT28|I like it.
NEUT29|I'm aware of the overhead resistance.
NEUT30|Yeah, lot of FaceTime and zoom date squint.
NEUT31|Bumble is being led by Whitney Wolf who is.
NEUT32|Who will be one of the youngest female CEOs to take a company public?
BULL33|And it is actually seeing impressive growth.
NEUT34|So do you swipe right on Bumble or what do you think?
NEUT35|Well, I can't buy either of these companies or I'm going to be single and using these apps because in my opinion these are overvalued.
NEUT36|I mean I'm happy to see a bumble go public.
BULL37|It's great you know to raise the capital that they're raising, but again, focused on match that we can really look at.
NEUT38|Trading as Todd said 52 times forward earnings.
BEAR39|There was a time when a company would announce an acquisition spending $1.7 billion and the actual company would get hit because of that loste cash.
BULL40|The stocks trading 8% higher today, so in my opinion it's a speculative kind of frenzy.
NEUT41|We'll have to see what this acquisition yields, but again, these are names.
BEAR42|I think if you chase these names here, it's very, very dangerous.
NEUT43|"I would stay away from the Bumble IPO and I would definitely not chase match."""
