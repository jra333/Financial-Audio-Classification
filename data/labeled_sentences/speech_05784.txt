NEUT2|I'm not a financial at 5 Sir, but I'm going to give you some technical analysis using a tradingview.
NEUT3|OK, we will start it now.
NEUT4|Enjoy.
BULL5|So now I'm gonna use XRP for USD T so before I start it gonna be a good.
BEAR6|Those pairing of XR paper USD T after hesitating near the 0.6 U.S. dollar for the past few days.
BEAR7|The Bulls are currently attempting to proper SRP or report to the zero point 65 U.S. dollar overheat.
BEAR8|The resistant this level is likely to act as a stiffer system because the price has turned down from it on five previous.
NEUT9|Occasion so I'm gonna use a technical analysis using Tradingview.
NEUT10|The combination between Bollinger Band moving average and errors I stock has stick to know what to know more about the support and also the resistant.
NEUT11|However, the Rising 20 day exponential moving average is at 0.53 U.S. dollar and the RSI above 65 side.
NEUT12|Just the path of least resistance is to the upside.
BULL13|If the Bulls can push and sustain the price above like 0.65 U.S. dollar.
NEUT14|The XR people you have DT pair could rally at Zero point 78 U.S. dollar and then go to one U.S. dollar.
BEAR15|This bullish few will invalidate if the price turns down.
BEAR16|An break below the moving average.
BULL17|Such a move will indicate that traders are selling on rally that could keep the pair range bound between Zero Point 42 U.S. dollar and go to the zero point 65 U.S. dollar for a few more days.
NEUT18|So this is all about XRP or report.
