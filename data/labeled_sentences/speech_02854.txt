NEUT0|"""Do you see it being related to just election jitters?"
NEUT1|Is it curfews in Europe?
NEUT2|Is it?
NEUT3|Is it stimulus talks?
NEUT4|Running a bit dry here or something else?
NEUT5|Well, it's really all of the above.
NEUT6|I mean, let's start with the stimulus because.
NEUT7|You know, in the past month, we've had eight different sessions.
NEUT8|Where the Dow moved 300 points or more and on what well on stimulus talks.
NEUT9|And so it looks as though we're not going to be getting a stimulus, at least not that quickly.
NEUT10|In terms of what was being priced into the market.
NEUT11|You know your point about the politics.
BULL12|I mean, I think that what got the market really excited the past couple of weeks was the sense we're going to.
NEUT13|We're going to blue wave and with the blue wave was going to come three and a half trillion dollars of stimulus.
NEUT14|And of course, we all know what that means.
NEUT15|For the stock market, but you know the polls now, even though they're showing that Joe Biden is going to take the White House.
BULL16|The polls are also showing that the GOP still have a slight edge in the Senate, so this view that there's going to be a clean sweep.
NEUT17|It's not that evident.
NEUT18|Riley's not right now, and so we have to face it.
BEAR19|You know, waking up this morning, you know you see the coronavirus getting worse everywhere.
BEAR20|But I really think Carly was the the lockdowns that we're seeing in parts of Europe.
BEAR21|I think that's making investors really nervous here.
NEUT22|Right, right?
NEUT23|On Treasurys, how should we be thinking about them right now in BlackRock?
NEUT24|Takes him to underweight this morning on stimulus hopes to that as you as you describe, but if that you carry that game theory through, how does the Fed respond?
NEUT25|What sorts of things are we saying about yields in the next 60 days?
NEUT26|Well look the next 60 days.
NEUT27|I think we're probably going to be where we've been in the past 60 days, you know which is in a range at the longer end of the curve.
NEUT28|Of course, the front end is going to get anchored by the fact that that's not going to do anything.
NEUT29|But I think we're in a range on Treasurys out the curve.
BULL30|I think that you know you get up towards point 8.9 on the 10 year.
NEUT31|It's a buying opportunity.
NEUT32|You get down towards point 5.6.
NEUT33|You know we're at a point where maybe you want to trade it on the short side, but I think that we're really in a range.
BEAR34|I don't understand why people think that we're going to go into a bear market on Treasurys.
NEUT35|I mean here, here we were.
NEUT36|Heading into the recession, this is back in January.
BEAR37|The ten year note was sitting at 1 1/2% before the recession an with a 3 1/2 percent unemployment rate and coming off a trillion dollar fiscal deficit.
NEUT38|So I don't know, you know, given the size of the deflationary output gap that we have, I mean it's going to take recurring rounds of stimulus to close that output gap anytime in the next few years.
NEUT39|There's no rate risk coming from the Fed.
NEUT40|There's really a limit, I think, unless we get real strong inflation.
BEAR41|As to how far this curve could steep, and so I don't know, I think that at worst I'm still bullish on Treasuries.
NEUT42|I think that you know at worst I'd be agnostic, but you know the bearish sentiment after a 20 basis point move.
NEUT43|Think about that crowd.
BULL44|We had to the 10 year note yield move up 20 basis points.
NEUT45|So far in October, up until today we have 50 of them.
NEUT46|We have 50 of those pack from 2009, 2019 and these bond bears come out of the woodwork each and every time.
NEUT47|To me it's just pure hysteria as far as I'm concerned.
NEUT48|There's lots of reasons why you want to have bonds in your portfolio.
NEUT49|Bonds Act as a balance in the portfolio and the beautiful thing about Treasurys.
NEUT50|Irrespective of how low the yield is, is that it's the only security around on the planet where you know with certainty where you're going to get paid upon maturity.
NEUT51|Shepard Smith here.
