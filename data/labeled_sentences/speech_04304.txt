NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Guys idea fliptronics?
NEUT2|I'm going to be talking about if Neo is a good investment and giving my price prediction on this coin going in the rest of 2020 then in 2021.
NEUT3|OK so Neo isn't listed on like a ton of exchanges honestly.
NEUT4|You know you can't find it on coin base and a couple other places, but they do have it on E Toro for cryptos.
NEUT5|If you guys didn't want to check it out here, I'll have some resource links in both the description and comments of this video for E Toro.
NEUT6|Now let's talk about Neo, so this is a Chinese token.
NEUT7|Some people call it the Ethereum killer, but clearly the price point on it is nowhere near Ethereum's price point, and it's currently ranked, I think 19 by market cap out of all the coins.
NEUT8|Now this coin has been hovering around.
NEUT9|You know, anywhere from like 7 to 15 to $20 now for the last couple of years, so.
BULL10|It's kind of been stuck in that range, but it's been getting some traction.
BEAR11|You know it's down from its all time highs.
NEUT12|Which were, you know, well over $100, but it looks like things might be turning around for this coin.
NEUT13|Now I've had my eye on it all right, but I do want to show you where it's at here on Coinmarketcap.
NEUT14|Understand though that this is a Chinese coin, you know it's it's trying to get some regulations with the government there.
NEUT15|You know it's kind of been up in the air and it kind of reflects in its price point, you know.
NEUT16|Things if the Chinese government were like, OK, we're going to use Neo is our main coin.
NEUT17|The price would obviously be a lot higher rate, but you know the benefit here is that you want to get coins when they're low.
NEUT18|You don't want to be buying them when they're you know super high.
NEUT19|That's the whole point you want to get it low.
NEUT20|Either sell high or you hold, you know, for the long term.
NEUT21|If you think the coin is going to keep going up and up, but you can see here, you know for the last couple of years, just not a lot of activity.
BEAR22|It's been stuck in the, you know seven you know under $20 range.
BULL23|But it's starting to break out a little bit over 20 bucks.
NEUT24|Now I wanted to pull up, you know, an article here with some price predictions people are giving on Neo, which are kind of ridiculous.
NEUT25|Honestly, some people are saying that it can go to like 4 or $500, you know, by the end of this year and then into 2021.
NEUT26|I'm going to be given more like a realistic expectation for Neo, and I also want to let everyone know, you know, you gotta get these coins at the right price.
NEUT27|Otherwise you're going to screw yourself.
NEUT28|Over and I think that if you can get Neo you know under $20, probably between like 15 and 18 dollars.
NEUT29|I think that's the sweet spot and you're willing to hold on to this coin for the next six months to a year.
NEUT30|My price prediction on Neo would be anywhere from 50 to $100.
NEUT31|Now that's going to be going into the rest of 2020, then in 2021, that would be the biggest upside.
BULL32|I think I could see this coin going so 50 to $100 by the end of 2021.
NEUT33|A lot of it's going to come down to the fact if they can get.
NEUT34|Regulations you know in their country.
NEUT35|Just remember that you know Neo, even though they're trying to call it the Ethereum killer.
NEUT36|It is a Chinese Asian token and you know you gotta just keep up on the news with it anyways.
NEUT37|If you guys could smash the like button, feel free to message me below in the comments if you want to chime in on Neo.
BULL38|"Thanks for watching and we'll see you in the next one."""
