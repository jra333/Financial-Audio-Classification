BULL0|"""We talked a little bit yesterday about Apple's big year and how stunning it has been."
NEUT1|Just 'cause the size of the company, Brian, I know you dug into this a little bit more or looking kind of the driving factors and stats behind Apple's big year.
NEUT2|What did you find out?
BULL3|Yeah, really a couple amazing stats.
NEUT4|Let me set this up real quick.
NEUT5|You have Apple's market cap hit $2 trillion on August 19th and it hasn't looked back on December 31st, 2019.
NEUT6|Apple's market cap stood at 1.29 trillion today.
NEUT7|Right now, almost $2.3 trillion.
NEUT8|So those big numbers Julie that we talked about yesterday.
BULL9|They continue to grow.
BULL10|They have continue to grow.
NEUT11|You look at Apple's price to earnings multiple right now, 33 times on a forward basis.
BULL12|That is about two times more than the five year average on Apple.
NEUT13|So in another way to look at it.
NEUT14|Apple is trading at a premium relative.
NEUT15|Its five year average P wonky but very important to a lot of folks that plug numbers into it spreadsheet and calculate apples fair value.
NEUT16|And last but not least, very simple number 85%.
NEUT17|That's how much Apple stock is up here today.
NEUT18|Almost two times the gain in the NASDAQ composite for the year to date and and what's interesting here guys is that 20% of that gain has come in the past month and a lot of the conventional wisdom out there in the street.
BEAR19|It's been because of the speculation about an Apple car.
NEUT20|We've talked about extensively, maybe by 2025.
NEUT21|Apple comes out with $100,000 electric car, but I think if you really dig down to the Apple Store right now, you poke.
NEUT22|Around on Wall Street and what you're seeing in the stock is just a lot of optimism around apples core product.
BULL23|The iPhone there continues to be really strong positive research out from the South side.
BULL24|Notably a company like JP Morgan saying that a lot of these iPhones have seen very, very strong demand, not just the regular iPhone 12 pro across the board.
BULL25|Even the Max, despite the higher prices.
NEUT26|And that is really what's driving the stock, and that's likely to drive the stock next year, ultimately fueling this 5G supercycle thesis that is now starting to play out.
NEUT27|And I think Brian.
NEUT28|All that stuff kind of feeds into this optimism around Apple.
NEUT29|I just called out one other amazing staff for Apple, which is what's happened in their Mac business.
NEUT30|Everyone's been at home.
BEAR31|Kids are being homeschooled.
BULL32|We've got 50% sales growth in a business that investors wouldn't care about it.
NEUT33|Alright, $9 billion in the last quarter.
BULL34|That's up from about 6 1/2 in the prior years quarter and I just think that's it's.
NEUT35|It's an amazing illustration of how these kind of forgotten growth levers for some companies got pulled because of how quickly everything happened during covid.
BULL36|Yeah, we'll see, though, if that momentum keeps up right.
NEUT37|If people are still going to be home this year if they've already bought the computers that they're going to buy, or are they going to keep buying them?
NEUT38|"We shall see."""
