BULL0|"""You've added to Wells Fargo."
BULL1|You've added to Raytheon.
NEUT2|You've added the Chevron you've added to Coca Cola.
NEUT3|Why, yeah?
NEUT4|Well, I have been adding for the last couple of weeks so some weeks it feels better than others but all I can do is dollar cost average and if I believe in kind of the medium to longer term that we do get through this pandemic that we do eventually get a virus and we get the economy to start working again.
NEUT5|And I think some of these stocks.
BEAR6|I'm sorry the vaccine but I think that the sum of the levels that these stocks have gotten that I mean just a week and a half ago.
NEUT7|Wells Fargo was yielding 8%, it's now at 6.7%.
NEUT8|You have a new CEO.
NEUT9|He just.
NEUT10|Hired four of his former colleagues from JP Morgan.
NEUT11|They're going to restructure.
BULL12|They're going to lower costs the whole 9 yards, and so I like that name.
BEAR13|It's down still 45% on the year on Raytheon.
NEUT14|I love this combination with United Technologies and Raytheon.
NEUT15|They've now completed the deal and they've spun off Otis and Carrier.
BULL16|It's a much more simple company, but it is the number 2 defense player in the world and they have a very strong backlog.
BULL17|Good free cash flow generation.
NEUT18|It is.
NEUT19|It is also yielding 4.7% just two days ago was at 5.2% dividend yield so.
NEUT20|To me, those two names are very exciting about some of these other CapEx.
BEAR21|Last about some of them, sorry, sorry to interrupt you, just real quick.
NEUT22|I'll get to that.
NEUT23|But what about what I mentioned at the top?
BULL24|You know, some of the moves that we've seen in retail stocks, which are up huge industrials are up almost 30% may in fact be 30% now off of their lows.
NEUT25|That doesn't give you pause at all.
NEUT26|Wondering whether those moves are justified, especially in some of the retail because.
BEAR27|But they're down 5060% deserved, deservedly so.
BULL28|One right deservedly so, no.
NEUT29|Well, I don't know some of them, some of them, some of them, for sure.
BEAR30|I mean, I think there are structural problems with Macy's and Kohl's, and Nordstrom and the big box retailers, but I mean, I. I mean, when resource is a real company, China is coming back and the stock is down from 150 and it got to 40.
NEUT31|I mean that to me is like it has a franchise that is worth something more than 40 in my mind, right?
BEAR32|So it's going to be volatile.
NEUT33|And by the way it was very painful to own it on the way down, but I just kept on.
NEUT34|Slowly picking away because I do think again in a year.
NEUT35|Some time it'll be higher.
NEUT36|You can paint the same brush with every single discretionary company, but that's why I was buying Coke.
BULL37|It's high quality, good balance sheet.
NEUT38|That's why I added McDonald's.
NEUT39|That's why I added to Starbucks.
NEUT40|All these companies, really good companies, great market share, awesome balance sheets and some have very good dividend yields and they got thrown away with all these other, more speculative names.
NEUT41|So you take a bar value on some quality you own.
NEUT42|"Some wins of the world, and you just kind of stay disciplined and try not to panic and stay calm."""
