NEUT0|"""I mean, Betty, this has been a tough report overall, so let's get you up to speed on what the headline numbers are in terms of earnings per share."
NEUT1|May wasn't earnings.
BEAR2|It was a loss per share.
NEUT3|The loss comes in at around 30.
BULL4|Again, $0.13 per share.
NEUT5|If you look at the overall picture that includes a $0.10 per share impact from foreign exchange on Venezuelan FX restrictions.
NEUT6|The estimate here was for a profit of $0.08 per share.
BULL7|So a very big miss here in terms of sales revenues coming in at $3.07 billion.
BEAR8|Missing the $3.37 billion average analyst estimate, it doesn't end there profit margins.
BEAR9|They were also lower 33.9% in terms of gross margins, the analyst community was expecting 39.4%.
BEAR10|So again a very large miss on profit margins as well.
NEUT11|When it comes to the actual smartphone shipments, that's big too, because they shipped 6.8 million smartphones in the first quarter, an average of 13 analysts that we pulled here at Bloomberg said that they were going to ship about seven and a half.
BEAR12|Million smartphones are also forecasting a loss next quarter when analysts were expecting some kind of gain.
NEUT13|Now this is important Betty, because this is the first full quarter that we've seen.
NEUT14|These BlackBerry Z10 model sales come out.
NEUT15|That's the big idea.
BULL16|Could these phones have actually done something to improve sales?
BEAR17|Also worth noting Betty that the short interest the number of people betting against Black Berry stock was at a record high entering this, so that's why you see that stock down precipitously so far in the pre market Betty.
NEUT18|That's right, about 20% right now in the premarket dumb, so it's not just BlackBerry, though they could feel the pinch.
BEAR19|There's ripple effects here.
NEUT20|Yeah, there are.
NEUT21|There are ripple effects, what one of the things that will be watching for is how many companies are also affected by this particular move in BlackBerry shares?
NEUT22|Remember these D 10 smartphones?
NEUT23|They use components from a lot of different other suppliers.
NEUT24|If you look at some of these were looking at names like Celestic at which gets around 12% of their revenues from BlackBerry.
NEUT25|Also Interdigitale gets about 14% of the revenues from BlackBerry.
NEUT26|And another one here watching as well as Jabil circuit, they get around 10% of their revenues from BlackBerry.
NEUT27|So Betty, this is not just about BlackBerry and the smartphone sales.
BEAR28|The ripple effects here could include other suppliers.
NEUT29|"People in BlackBerry supply chain, so that's why I will be watching all those shares throughout the course of the day, Betty."""
