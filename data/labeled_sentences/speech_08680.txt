BULL0|"""So it's good to see Jimmy have a positive day as well."
BEAR1|They basically finished yesterday at 1:20 and down 33%.
BULL2|Right now they're at 1:28 in the premarket up 7%.
BULL3|They had a high of 136 in the pre market.
BULL4|We're seeing some really good positive movement in the after hours.
BEAR5|We've seen that drop, but then it steadily started to increase and then we didn't see any type of gap up or gap down from the after hours to the premarket but.
BULL6|It's good to be able to see this positive movement at least a little bit.
BULL7|We are starting to fall down as the day goes on, but I think we're going to see that positive movement as we start to get to the end of the premarket, and then when we get into the open.
BULL8|Hopefully we see that positive day.
BULL9|"Everything looks like it's going to be positive, but it could still reverse, so don't get caught up on the fact that we're positive right now."""
