NEUT0|"""Let's dive a little bit deeper into all of the market action with our reporters Abigail."
NEUT1|Get us started Roman.
NEUT2|I'm thinking about that shuffle near the record highs that you all were just talking about through the charts.
NEUT3|Of course.
BEAR4|The technicals this chart is slightly greater than one year and we see the volatility a bit of a range here, even though you don't see the bottom of it that started back in 2018, but there's that horrible volatility to the downside.
BEAR5|The Orcier momentum indicator going well into oversold territory.
BULL6|This year's big move, higher as we go into somewhat overbought territory, but the point that I'd like to make.
BEAR7|We have the S&P 500 stalling out near these all time highs.
BEAR8|Unable to get there appearing that's going to start rounding back down that RSI now is on its Third Point of a lower high, suggesting that the Bulls are getting weaker.
NEUT9|This as we go into that third quarter earnings season.
NEUT10|Of course we need to.
BULL11|This chart may suggest stocks could just cool off just a little bit, at least in the weeks ahead ranita.
NEUT12|Abigail, I'm looking at McDonald's and Beyond Meat which rolls today.
NEUT13|There testing out a new plant based burger in Canada.
BULL14|Beyond meat is rising.
BEAR15|It rose more than 10% during the session, recoup some of its losses and it looks like McDonald's ended just around flat.
NEUT16|But beyond meat has been a major target of short sellers, with about 40% of float being used to the company to short the company.
NEUT17|According to S3 Partners, head of research.
NEUT18|And by the way they're calling this new burger the PLT, which stands for plant.
NEUT19|Lettuce, tomato, not to be confused with BLT Taylor.
BULL20|Well renita, I am taking a look at shares of Micron and the good news is earnings just came out and it looks like a Bulls win again, at least for Micron.
BULL21|Big Top line revenue beat, which is what analysts were looking for.
BULL22|A $4.87 billion versus estimates of 4.56 billing and then a beat on the bottom line.
BULL23|Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share at a dollar five cents versus estimates at $0.48.
NEUT24|So again, analysts were really looking in the past few weeks keeping Cousins Securities.
NEUT25|JP Morgan, Credit Suisse.
BULL26|Always, really, really hoping that this sort of would come in, filter through and show that Micron can be profitable in what has otherwise been a pretty rough market for the chip makers.
NEUT27|Now if you want to take a look at a chart that I'm showing here on my terminal, a lot of this does relate to both NAND in DRAM prices.
BULL28|We do know that Micron gets about 70% of the revenue from DRAM and then I'm taking a look here at Nan prices as well, because as you have seen prices there in blue starting to bottom out, perhaps turning a little bit of a corner, and that hopefully then should be a boost here for the share so.
BEAR29|Shares again, fluctuating between gains and losses.
NEUT30|Right now it does look like a losses.
BULL31|"They're looking maybe at that forward guidance earnings per share that maybe analysts aren't too too excited bout despite the current quarter coming in better than expected."""
