BULL0|"""It's great to have you back on."
NEUT1|I want to start, of course, with these stories stock that has been GameStop you gave us the options trade last week.
NEUT2|What's the option set up like on Jimmy right now?
NEUT3|And more importantly, what does the setup tell you about sentiment?
NEUT4|Well, you know it's interesting.
NEUT5|We talked about all the foot volume last week.
BEAR6|We talked about the stock moving lower and who's getting hurt there.
BEAR7|But it's interesting to note that despite stock trading down significantly implied volatility in the GME options is also down significantly.
NEUT8|So we're going to have is a situation where you can look at a call.
NEUT9|Sorry, I put option from last week.
NEUT10|Let's just say the March 100 foot, for example, you would expect.
BULL11|Just buy the stock price, move alone that those March 100 puts would increase in value dramatically this week.
BEAR12|But because there's also the volatility component in options and volatility is down significantly along with the stock, what you're seeing is those put the value of a put like the March 100 foot is actually not up that much because volatility is down.
NEUT13|Alright, well I'm going to take a little bit out of the weeds options action.
NEUT14|By the way.
NEUT15|5:30 PM Eastern every Friday night.
NEUT16|TuneIn Chris went, you know, there's a lot of talk about the shorts.
BEAR17|Got bludgeoned out.
BEAR18|We know that and they're going to be hesitant to put a short on the equity.
NEUT19|Does that put option betting?
NEUT20|Basically, the price will go down.
NEUT21|Indicate to you that they're either hedging a bullish bet on the stock or they're betting the stock will continue to fall, but using options, not the equity.
BULL22|Well, we certainly saw a lot of foot volume and we highlighted that in addition to this, the increase in open interest.
NEUT23|But what you're seeing today and this week is expectations.
BEAR24|I believe if you're looking at both the options and the stock for GME to somewhat return back to normal and that does not only include the stock returning back to more normalized levels, but it also means that volatility is going to turn back to more normalized levels, so the implied volatility level of the options is contracting.
BULL25|A lot, so that's why you're seeing that the puts are not increasing in value quite as much.
NEUT26|So investors who are looking to have a strong directional opinion the stock but do not have a strong directional opinion on the option in the volatility should be looking at spreads to express their opinions as opposed to the options out, right?
NEUT27|Because when implied volatility levels are three, four, 500% that that parameter kind of crowds out a lot of the other Greeks and becomes the most important parameter.
NEUT28|So if you don't have a strong opinion on the implied volatility level year.
NEUT29|Better off looking at spreads to express your directional opinions.
