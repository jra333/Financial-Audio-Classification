BEAR0|"""Tesla is down in the premarket after its much anticipated battery day at that event."
BULL1|Elon Musk said his big goal was to drive down battery costs, but he adds that technology to make that happen will take some time.
NEUT2|It's very clear it will take us.
BULL3|Probably a year to 18 months to start realizing these these advantages and probably to fully realize the advantages.
NEUT4|Probably about three years or thereabouts.
NEUT5|Alright, so Jim streets of it split today on regardless of how much time it takes.
BULL6|The fact that it would happen at all could improve volume and margins.
NEUT7|Others are saying that even though that's a long term story near term, there's not many catalysts to drive the stock.
NEUT8|Well, OK, I think that you're you've got this process by which the stock is up really big ahead of battery day, and then he delivers what I mean.
BULL9|Fill both, sent me some terrific stuff delivered, targeting 56% drop in the cost of battery cells.
NEUT10|That matters tremendously, but we were talking about the million.
NEUT11|Mile battery.
NEUT12|What a setup that almost nobody could possibly deliver in the 20 million vehicles.
NEUT13|A lot of people have been talking about the idea that one day he could do 20 million, so therefore that's put a lot more than Toyota, so therefore we could justify the valuation.
NEUT14|We've got analysts.
BULL15|We have fresh pair picbear.
NEUT16|We've got people who say listen, it's finally come down.
NEUT17|You want to be.
NEUT18|Here's the way I look at it.
NEUT19|Call, I think if you like Tesla before you like Tesla, after an if you didn't like him before.
NEUT20|You don't like it after because it's Elon Musk and you're betting on Musk.
NEUT21|And I wish there were more to it, David.
NEUT22|Musk is must per share.
NEUT23|OK, it's must for sure.
NEUT24|Yeah, but it's funny to listen to him sort of under promising and interesting.
NEUT25|Yeah, I mean lack of hyperbole.
NEUT26|20 million cars is kind of.
NEUT27|Yeah, by the way, one of his more interesting things.
BULL28|Jim was saying that he's confident they can make a compelling $25,000 electric vehicle that is also fully autonomous.
NEUT29|Mean that could be a game.
NEUT30|I think.
BULL31|25 grand for a full EV autonomous vehicle in three years, more fills.
NEUT32|Talking about how low they can really lower the price of this, but yes, that would be.
BULL33|Real game changer and of course would also make the skies cleaner.
NEUT34|It could do a lot of coral.
NEUT35|I think that there's a lot of people still excited that he's that he's a bit like Henry Ford.
NEUT36|OK, he gets the cost down.
BULL37|Case the workers OK and everybody does better.
NEUT38|I don't know.
NEUT39|I still.
NEUT40|Yeah, I'm a believer in the guy.
NEUT41|This is not Nicola.
NEUT42|OK this is not weak along.
NEUT43|This is Tesla.
NEUT44|It's not a truck, but talking supply again, yeah no.
NEUT45|But again we're talking about supply and you keep referencing the Baird fresh bearish pick and part of their point is that they're just worried about the consumer in a recessionary environment.
NEUT46|How does that play in?
BULL47|Well, I think it's a good piece because I think that Tesla is somewhat recession proof, not recession resistant.
NEUT48|That's the new term.
NEUT49|Companies are either recession resistant or assessment proof.
NEUT50|I like the peace the bear piece because it does present the negatives and the positives is a price target.
NEUT51|Boost, by the way, and I always find David when they do boost boost the price target.
NEUT52|"You have to be more positive than negative."""
