NEUT0|"""We are of course watching for Dow 22,000."
NEUT1|We've been watching all morning.
NEUT2|Come on in economist John loss.
NEUT3|All right, John, I say that there is a kind of a mood of economic optimism.
NEUT4|Ignore the swamp.
NEUT5|Ignore politics.
BULL6|There's some optimism about the economy and that's boosting the markets.
NEUT7|You agree, I agree, but it's more than optimism.
BEAR8|There's actually been kind of the rubber hitting the road.
BULL9|We've had a number of regulations being repealed, but there's optimism about the tax changes right now.
NEUT10|the United States has the highest tax rate in the world, almost 40.
NEUT11|Percent you have candidates about 20% where somebody going to invest a dollar if they can.
NEUT12|Each dollar they making profit they get to keep $0.20 more and that may change very soon.
NEUT13|But John why are investors expressing any confidence that will get a tax cut?
NEUT14|I mean they fit the Republican Party.
BEAR15|Congress failed miserably on health care.
NEUT16|Didn't get it.
NEUT17|Why are investors believing this time around that this time will get it done?
NEUT18|Well look, even if you think there's a 50% chance that something will go through, this is going to be such a massive change.
BULL19|If it does get through, we're going to see investment flowing in from around the world.
NEUT20|This is going to be the 1980s all over again.
NEUT21|The capital is very liquid.
BULL22|It moves very quickly, particularly in international markets to where I can get the highest return.
NEUT23|If you lower the tax rate from near 40% to 20%, that's a huge difference.
NEUT24|And people who would have thought of investing in the United States before going to flood money in here.
NEUT25|Just like even what do you think?
NEUT26|Some of the cash will come back to America that's currently being held by big technology companies.
NEUT27|I mean Apple has got about $220 billion cash sitting overseas.
NEUT28|Does that come back here?
NEUT29|If we get tax cuts?
NEUT30|So yeah, a lot of that's going to come back but but that's just a small portion of the money that's in international capital markets.
NEUT31|That's going to flow to the United States.
NEUT32|Where do you think would go on the Dow industrials if we really do get tax cuts this year?
NEUT33|Oh, I mean, I, my guess is you probably, if you think there's a 50% chance that they're going to get this.
NEUT34|My guess is actually getting it.
NEUT35|You may see another 400 points, 500 points, maybe in the Dow, just on the news that we're likely to get it.
NEUT36|That's it, right?
NEUT37|OK, how about Amazon corporate executives nowadays?
NEUT38|Mention Amazon in their earnings calls more often than President Trump.
NEUT39|And frankly, they're looking over their shoulder.
NEUT40|Best scared of Amazon.
NEUT41|Your thoughts on that?
NEUT42|Well look.
NEUT43|I mean, why shouldn't they be scared of a company that provides products at a low price and high quality?
BEAR44|I mean that should scare lots of potential competitors that are there.
BULL45|OK John, thanks for joining us.
NEUT46|That was very interesting.
NEUT47|Your statement on tax cuts, a flood of money comes in.
NEUT48|If we cut taxes, we're waiting for it with patiently waiting.
NEUT49|John Lott.
BULL50|"Thanks a lot, OK?"""
