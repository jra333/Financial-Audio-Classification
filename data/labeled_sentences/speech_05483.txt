NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today we're going to be taking a look at the cryptocurrency oh XD which is orchid against Heather US based on finance prices."
BULL1|So in my last videos that I've done on this one a couple of days back, the levels that we had outlined to break where the 73 cent mark and like that 76 cent Mark in order to send this one potentially back up to the top of this trend line.
NEUT2|I think we said $0.80 ISH was kind of the top.
BEAR3|The top of this week was the last level of resistance we outlined, so all three of those levels had been broken these last two days.
NEUT4|If you have been watching and you saw this breaking close on this candle, you might have been able to also catch some of this.
NEUT5|Move all the way up to like that dollar three cent level.
NEUT6|So I mean, since the break of that first resistance we outlined that was about a 40% move.
NEUT7|So at this point, moving forward a couple of things, I'd want to see happen.
NEUT8|So the first level of support and it's kind of right where the daily candle closed is.
BEAR9|I don't want to see it close at this point below, like 80 to 81 cents.
NEUT10|I think.
BULL11|If that happens, the next kind of logical level of support to watch is anywhere from 75 to $0.77, but this one can start to consolidate higher than it did in this range.
NEUT12|Down here, if we can kind of look even identical, but this up higher that sets this one up for another.
BULL13|Possibility to have another really nice leg up, especially with all the volume that's starting to come in all the eyes on this one.
NEUT14|I mean this this is one that definitely if it can consolidate it doesn't even have to be above 81 cent level or 80 cent level, that would be ideal.
NEUT15|But even if it came down a little bit consolidated higher than here it be, you know, set up for potentially another leg, but where it is now what I'd want to see is either some or sideways, or I'd want to see some more volume come in again and just continue to trend to the upside.
NEUT16|I mean, this is still a pretty nice looking chart.
NEUT17|Obviously you have to keep in mind some of the different support levels like around that $0.78, but like even more so like that 75% level.
NEUT18|But what I'm watching for look going forward is either a bounce in the next day or two, or just a few more days just consolidating before another huge leg up.
NEUT19|But this is one that definitely has a good look to it.
BULL20|Though it is after a candle like this, it is a little bit hard to predict what direction this is going to go, but it did have a very nice daily close above.
BULL21|You know this prior resistance turned support like 81 cents.
NEUT22|Tab out a few days now, so I wanted to see that continue and I do want to see this one continue.
BEAR23|To the upside, it is still a pretty bullish chart in my opinion.
NEUT24|Just keep in mind some of the support levels to watch.
