NEUT19|OK?
NEUT20|If we Scroll down over here, you guys need to understand when it comes to Genius brand, they actually focus on the entertainment of kids.
NEUT21|OK?
BULL22|If we look at this for the past year, USC last summer, yes, and see this huge increase literally going up to like 7 almost $8.00.
NEUT23|Which is absolutely insane.
NEUT24|And then it just literally just crashed going to a dollar even below a dollar.
BULL25|Now you need to understand that James Brown was actually doing really good.
NEUT26|They were doing in, uh, there was a lot of news, you know.
NEUT27|Back during summer they announced that they were releasing their app.
NEUT28|So if you go to the App Store, you guys can search.
NEUT29|Genius brand US will see that they have their own app where they show free shows for kids.
NEUT30|OK, you know, TV shows absolutely free like Netflix, which is really cool.
NEUT31|They also they were actually working with other things like some free shows, working with Stanley about superheroes or working with some other stuff with.
NEUT32|You go and and other stuff like that like like really cool entertainment for kids for kids which is really cool, but they also were focusing on bigger things.
NEUT33|Now the only problem is we really haven't had any news recently until the beginning of the year.
NEUT34|Are we also gotten used that they also partner up with LG?
NEUT35|Meaning that are there apples like right there so people could install it.
NEUT36|You know, people can watch right away, so that was something really good.
NEUT37|But then after that you know we didn't get any news until now.
BEAR38|But the only problem is right now this stock is being very bullish.
NEUT39|There actually aren't any news why it's going up.
NEUT40|It was more like a village is, you know, went up and then.
NEUT41|I'm guessing people you know with the whole volume and people seeing now that it's going up people starting to buy.
NEUT42|So we go over here, yes, and see that today it is being very bullish.
NEUT43|OK, there is no news why it's going up, but always remember when its stock is being very bullish, it could be very risky.
NEUT44|So let me know down in the comments section below.
NEUT45|What do you guys think about this?
NEUT46|Obviously when Assad goes up with no news, you gotta be very careful because you know most of the time.
NEUT47|People are just hyping it up.
NEUT48|People are just buying eventually.
BEAR49|It's going to drop so it's always safe to buy a stock weather when there's positive news.
BULL50|And it's going up because, you know for a fact it's going up because they're doing something.
NEUT51|But when the stock is going up by itself like that, that's very bullish.
NEUT52|But I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT53|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys on my next video."""
