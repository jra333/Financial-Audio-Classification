NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys, it's your boy will back on the video today."
NEUT1|Today would be talking about Tesla ticker symbol TSLA.
NEUT2|Make sure you guys like the video, subscribe comment and all that good stuff and I'm gonna give you guys some key levels for their own Tesla.
NEUT3|If you guys were in my Patreon you would have got their alert for Tesla making a new high and it did today.
NEUT4|So these are some levels that I'm looking at.
NEUT5|This is the old high resistance level.
NEUT6|Right here, as you can see, it barely breached it and came down, and now it's trading sideways so.
NEUT7|This is a support I want to see Tesla hold so say tomorrow morning and again tomorrow is the last day of trading this week 'cause Friday is closed for the new year.
NEUT8|So say Tesla start raining down.
NEUT9|I wanted to stay above this level.
NEUT10|OK, so if it comes down tomorrow holds above this level and the RSI crosses the 40 at this level then I will get in or call option to make newer highs.
BULL11|'cause I do think Tesla will make new highs tomorrow.
NEUT12|I don't think this was the end of the run so I'm looking for that bounce off this support and make new highs but if it falls below this support right and start testing this as a resistance like prices went up there then I'll just wait till the next week to see what Tesla gives us.
NEUT13|Then, but these are my tools for Tesla.
NEUT14|Really quick video to some level you can watch out for resistance 695.47 and a support is 681.49.
NEUT15|OK so make sure you guys watch this lower tomorrow.
NEUT16|For Tesla it hope you guys like the video.
NEUT17|Remember, this is not a recommendation by so anything, just for educational purposes only.
NEUT18|So do not try anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in next week.
NEUT19|"Bye."""
