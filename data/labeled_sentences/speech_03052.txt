NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX Empire Facebook reports earnings after the US closing Bell on Wednesday."
BULL1|Stock topped out around 2:18 in 2018 and then spent all of 2019 working its way back up to the prior high reached it in January and then plunged during the pandemic declined recover, quickly coming back to the prior high and may now the stock finally completed a breakout in at the end of July early August and it ejected into this one big rally way back that brought the stock back up above 300.
NEUT2|So that was a high for the year and the stock spent the last, what five months now grinding sideways in this consolidation pattern they see from this pattern we have two lows that are horizontal and we have a descending high.
NEUT3|Now this is sort of a set up for a descending triangle pattern.
BEAR4|If we get another lower high right here around 290.
NEUT5|So we have to watch that now.
NEUT6|The stock does break out about that level.
NEUT7|Get back to this high, it's going to become a rectangle pattern, which is kind of a different animal.
BEAR8|I just don't get the feeling that Facebook is going to break out or breakout.
NEUT9|Breakdown anytime soon, so I think we're still going to have such a range bound action.
BULL10|Maybe until accumulation picks up even more, we get back to this prior high on the on balance volume indicator.
NEUT11|Now it should be a strong quarter, but at its core what you take oil?
NEUT12|The political influences of Facebook is a cyclical stock that depends on ad revenue, so that's the number to watch.
NEUT13|"During tomorrow night's confessional."""
