BULL0|"""Cheers buddy."
NEUT1|Thanks.
NEUT2|Obviously, the concern that we would have is liquid ITI, becauses a falling prices on stock market, while unfortunate further holders of shares doesn't necessarily carry any consequences for anyone else except for those holders.
NEUT3|But of course you have to be sure that liquidity is available to institutions.
NEUT4|In a fast moving situation, and so that will be the main focus of our attention.
BULL5|Yeah, yeah.
BEAR6|It sounds very glib of me to say that time we would consider it to be a correction, even at worse when it was 450 points down this morning we were talking about 10% or so, which is less than half the level it was in 87, which is generally accepted to be a crash.
BULL7|So we maintain that the market itself is strong.
BULL8|The economy is strong and we are looking at a correction here.
NEUT9|Play Simon.
NEUT10|50 30 folders.
NEUT11|I'm sure the the financial media will be writing this up as as Black Tuesday, but certainly this is an important event for investors and for stock markets given the very sharp declines that we've seen globally.
NEUT12|20 offered Swiss.
NEUT13|28 thirty 3/5.
NEUT14|Hold on.
NEUT15|Stability in policy making is even more necessary in a world of fast moving global financial markets, it is important that governments and central banks around the world remain vigilant at times of sudden moves in markets.
NEUT16|"But it is the task of government at all times to ensure a long-term and stable framework."""
