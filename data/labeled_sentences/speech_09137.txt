NEUT0|"""We have been asking you for at least a week or two to come on and you don't want to do that."
NEUT1|At first.
NEUT2|You were kind of waiting to see how things played out and you wanted to wait until you actually had something to say.
NEUT3|So what are you thinking?
NEUT4|Based on what we've seen, the crazy swings over the last several weeks.
BEAR5|Well, I would say this is the 8th recession induced bear market.
BULL6|I've lived through.
NEUT7|This is different than the ones in the past as it's a combination of a financial crisis, oil price collapse and of course the coronavirus which has caused a broad scale shutdown of the economy.
NEUT8|And this occurred at a time when the stock market was expensive by any historical standard.
NEUT9|And if you study, it's very important to understand history.
BEAR10|If you study past cycles, you find the following on average a bear market decline is about 25%.
NEUT11|This one, I guess, speak the truth.
BEAR12|So far has been down about 35%, so not terribly Adeline, but you know down 25% typically decline last about a year, which is about had a longer recession.
BEAR13|Last GDP contracts about 2% earnings drop close to 15 to 20%.
BEAR14|And importantly, this important importantly, the market on average bottoms out three months before the recession ends.
NEUT15|The stock market leads the economy.
NEUT16|I think what happens from here is a function of your view of how the coronavirus plays out.
NEUT17|Call me an uninformed optimist.
NEUT18|Keep telling people you know I don't have a medical degree.
NEUT19|I have two PHD's that they both honorary, but if I'm right in the virus call if I'm right and that's the big if I have no particular expertise, I think the market at the recent low of 2187 was close enough to the bottom to be called the bottom.
BEAR20|If the economic shutdown goes beyond April into the third quarter, I would be less optimistic on the virus.
NEUT21|My general view is with the world focusing on a problem.
NEUT22|Governments, you know.
NEUT23|Corporations, independent scientists.
NEUT24|When the world this is worldwide.
NEUT25|Focusing on a problem, it will be solved quicker than most people think.
NEUT26|I'm guessing June, but that it's a pure guess.
NEUT27|I think we all have to put this into perspective.
NEUT28|While the loss of any human life is tragic, the coronavirus has had much more serious impact on business activity than human life thus far, and let's hope and pray that it continues.
NEUT29|That way I want to state some statistics during the last year's flu season, 2018-2019 with 35.5 million flu cases, thirty 4200 deaths, the 1718 flu season with 45 million cases, 61,000 deaths, and in the 1617 season they were 29 million cases, 38,000 deaths.
NEUT30|It is bewildering to me that building, I guess it's it's.
NEUT31|It's interesting to me that people react so strongly to every new coronavirus development.
NEUT32|My point is only to show that the fear factor is exploding.
NEUT33|the United States and frankly.
BEAR34|"It's a different number this morning, probably as of yesterday afternoon, there are approximately 82,000 people, United States and the three US territories who have tested positive and approximately 12190 deaths, which is tragic, but you know very very very small relative to past flu seasons."""
