NEUT0|"""I am David Gardner, co-founder of The Motley Fool and Chief Rule Breaker."
NEUT1|We're a couple weeks into our 11:00 o'clock stock series.
BULL2|I hope you've been enjoying it as much as I have.
NEUT3|I've watched each one of them.
BULL4|We've challenged our analysts to find 50 winning stocks in 50 days.
NEUT5|Now, that might sound like a lot of stocks, but the truth is we think there are a lot more than 50 great companies out there, so this isn't a hard series to put together.
BULL6|And I'm excited to join in.
NEUT7|Next week I'm going to be picking in stock and we have a lot more exciting stocks to come.
NEUT8|So we've already taken him from National Bank of Greece, right through to Yum Brands.
NEUT9|And in the coming weeks will take you beyond that.
NEUT10|I'm very excited.
BULL11|I hope you'll join us.
NEUT12|11:00 o'clock.
NEUT13|"Stock each morning next week."""
