NEUT0|"""Our editor in Chief, Andy Server joins us right now and and EU member on the old Star Trek show when Mr. Spock would raise his eyebrow, he would go up just like that when something very curious happened there."
NEUT1|8.6 million reasons to raise eyebrows after Warren Buffett did with our parent company, Verizon, can you help us understand it?
NEUT2|Yeah, that's right Adam.
NEUT3|Yesterday his new Holdings were released to the world and maybe the most surprising was a big purchase of Verizon stock, our parent company.
NEUT4|I don't know if you think about it though.
NEUT5|Adam.
BEAR6|Why is it so surprising in the stock was down from like 61 bucks to 54 and change and it was yielding 4.6%.
NEUT7|So this is someone who looks for value and he snapped up a bunch of share.
NEUT8|As you can see the stock trading up nicely today also there on the screen you saw Chevron CVX that was another stock that he picked up as well.
NEUT9|Picked up a bunch of medical stocks pharma stocks I should say as well.
NEUT10|Merck, Bristol, Myers and AbbVie.
NEUT11|And those stocks are all up pretty much all the stocks that he reportedly bought in the last quarter are trading up today, so that is the power of the Oracle you guys.
NEUT12|Indian give you no more buffet.
BULL13|Very very well.
NEUT14|You've interviewed him a number of times.
NEUT15|I think investors are really trying to pour through some of these decisions and try to figure out what Warren Buffett, what his readers.
NEUT16|Right now the market is read is right now the economy.
NEUT17|I'm curious just to get your take on that because some of these moves wild.
NEUT18|Maybe they weren't so surprising.
NEUT19|They are very interesting by him.
NEUT20|Yeah, totally.
NEUT21|I mean you know the oil the oil moves are interesting because he the Chevron acquisition at investment he made.
BEAR22|I should say you know, a lot of people say that these stocks are going down forever.
NEUT23|You know?
NEUT24|Obviously not, but you know, they've been a value trap in a way, Shawna, because if you've invested in Exxon thinking it's cheap, it's just keeps getting cheaper.
BEAR25|Which is to say, would be losing money in it.
BULL26|So that's a big endorsement there.
BULL27|On the other hand, he did get out of another oil.
BULL28|Stock at the same time, so not universally bullish across the board there Apple.
NEUT29|I think you know, we gotta talk about that you guys, because that was big news.
NEUT30|He paired his Holdings there.
NEUT31|Still, the largest holding for Berkshire Hathaway 120 billion.
BEAR32|But that stock is down today.
NEUT33|And so you gotta ask yourself.
BULL34|I mean, Apple's been on such a great run.
NEUT35|Part of that has been the endorsement of Warren Buffett.
NEUT36|I mean, you have to be perfectly honest here.
NEUT37|And now that's no longer there, and so that is actually, you know, a wind in the face.
NEUT38|For Apple investors.
NEUT39|I'm not saying the company's not going to continue to do well, or even that the stock will continue to go up, but it does not have that wind at its back anymore that, you know, has this blue chip seal on it, which is to say, Warren Buffett?
NEUT40|And the server is our editor in Chief.
BULL41|We appreciate your being here live long and can I do it live long and prosper there?
BULL42|I think I can do it.
NEUT43|"There we go."""
