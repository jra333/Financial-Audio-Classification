NEUT0|"""This does not deal with the regulatory problem."
NEUT1|It does not deal with the scams and frauds and it does not deal with the compliance issue writ large.
BEAR2|Although it might solve some of the compliance questions, we're making slow progress on regulatory right?
NEUT3|You had the SEC come out and said OK, Bitcoin Bitcoin, cash Ethereum?
NEUT4|These aren't really securities, their utility tokens so that they got grandfathered Gran father.
NEUT5|But that's that's a big deal, yeah.
NEUT6|And so it allows.
NEUT7|So like now they say we can start where we know there's regulatory certainty.
BULL8|And so I think over time you're going to get more and more regulatory certainty.
NEUT9|It's not there completely 100%.
NEUT10|Most firms, ours included, are operating under the rules of that we would use if they were currencies or equity securities, right know your customer anti money laundering.
NEUT11|Same type process that we would use when I was at Fortress or at Goldman Sachs.
BULL12|You've been right.
NEUT13|And you've been wrong on this custody issue, right?
NEUT14|Being one was required before.
NEUT15|Institutions on mass would take an interest in this asset class.
BEAR16|We have yet to see that, but there are signs that you're right wrong on the timing.
BULL17|You thought we would see the institutional uptick already.
NEUT18|So one thing I've learned in this process is everything takes a little longer than you hope it does right?
NEUT19|The whole crypto ecosystem is still like a fourth grader, and we all want it to be a High School graduate tomorrow and then a pH D the next day and this stuff just takes longer.
NEUT20|It takes longer growing through internal committees.
NEUT21|It takes longer testing because, again, the idea that it's a bear instrument.
NEUT22|He has to kind of resonate like if you lose it, you're screwed and so some people have been an so people really.
NEUT23|If you're going to put your reputation of 78 years of Fidelity on the line, you better be darn sure that your process works, and so you know they've been working on this for years.
BULL24|And so it's really exciting that they're joining.
BULL25|We're going to win their first client, so it's exciting for us Bitcoin just to use it as a crypto proxy.
NEUT26|Is it 6400 bucks, give or take right now?
NEUT27|If this wave of institutional buying comes?
NEUT28|Where is it going to be six months from now listen?
NEUT29|I think you've got to take out 6800 first, and if that happens the technical level, the technical level, and if that happens, you'll see people get excited and kind of front run.
NEUT30|The institutions coming in 10 thousands of big level and I don't see us breaking 10,000 by the end of the year.
NEUT31|But I think Q1Q2.
NEUT32|If the institution starts coming in, you'll put in new highs.
NEUT33|You trade crypto.
NEUT34|People need to know this right?
NEUT35|You go along.
NEUT36|You go short.
NEUT37|I go along I go short.
NEUT38|How do you feel about it right now?
NEUT39|You know we're long we're long Bitcoin is held really well above 6200.
NEUT40|It gets you scared.
BULL41|There seems to be support there.
NEUT42|"What's interesting is in the last six months people have divided the world kind of Bitcoin and everything else, and Bitcoin seems to have now been invested with store of value."""
