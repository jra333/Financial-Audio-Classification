BEAR2|The key versus the US dollar has been mostly moving within a narrow range over the last five trading days between Zero Point 6950 and Zero point 7050.
BEAR3|This neutral tone is also projected by the RSI, which which is currently at 50 and has remained in this area throughout this period of consolidation.
BEAR4|However, the bearish cross recently recorded with the 50 day moving average dropping below the 200 day one, could indicate that we're about to enter a period of.
BEAR5|Downward movement for the pair.
BEAR6|On the upside, the 50 day moving average County at Zero Point, 7062, and the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at Zero Point, 7068.
BEAR7|This is, of course, the retracement of the N8 December 23 down like this area is expected to act as an immediate resistance area for the pair.
NEUT8|The next key resistance level is the 200 day moving average.
NEUT9|Add Zero point 7083.
NEUT10|And above that we have the 50% Fibonacci level at Zero point 7131.
BEAR11|On the downside, the 23.6% Fibo Nachi retracement level add zero point.
NEUT12|6989 will likely act as.
NEUT13|Images support level.
BULL14|A successful daily close below this point will bring into scope the December 23 low, which is a 16 1/2 months low of zero point 6861 into within reach.
BULL15|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
