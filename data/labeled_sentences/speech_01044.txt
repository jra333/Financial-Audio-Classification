NEUT0|"""Good evening, I'm dan.fitzpatrick@stockmarketmentor.com and it's Thursday, April 30th."
BULL1|Thank the good Lord Aprils over right this last week has been a pretty interesting one.
NEUT2|Not particularly pleasant, but look Amazons.
NEUT3|What I wanted to point to today.
BEAR4|This is a stock that gapped up.
NEUT5|Looked a lot like Netflix, right?
BEAR6|Gapped up.
BULL7|Netflix though trickled up a bit the next day.
BULL8|OK, great Netflix has been holding.
BEAR9|It's been holding this level here, certainly down at 534 but but you can see how the stock is actually holding at a higher level.
NEUT10|Amazon didn't do that.
NEUT11|OK, there was no follow through the next day.
NEUT12|Although make note of this, there was a little fake out.
NEUT13|OK look, let's look and see what the NASDAQ did that day.
BEAR14|It gapped up so the NASDAQ gaps up that day.
BEAR15|An ultimately sells off Amazon gapped up that day.
BULL16|OK, gaps up.
NEUT17|A percent *****.
NEUT18|A bunch of bulls in and then spits him out.
NEUT19|The point is this.
NEUT20|When you see a stock that's up this much, you gotta be selling into this.
NEUT21|It was right even to be selling not voxeljet It was right to even be selling Netflix because the stocks just trickled sideways.
BULL22|But with Amazon this is a clear break of new support and the stock is now coming back to Earth, probably faster than one of those bozo drones.
NEUT23|That's going to be delivering packages as long as it's not up above my house.
NEUT24|So here's what you want to do first of all.
NEUT25|Set a price alert if you don't want to put stops in, that's fine, but when a stock does this when it's up so much on a percent on a point basis, and here is a percentage basis as well.
NEUT26|At least put a stock just a little bit under that level and know that if that stop gets it, that's your oh crap level.
NEUT27|That means that everybody who bought everybody who bought.
NEUT28|On this day.
NEUT29|Everybody who bought is a loser.
NEUT30|If you're inside this box, you're actually in the red and you're not happy.
NEUT31|So as soon as this.
NEUT32|Stop gets hit.
NEUT33|What happens?
BEAR34|This stock continues lower and I'm giving you pearls so watch for more.
NEUT35|Selling like what's the catalyst for somebody to say wow four 2178 that's the price I've been waiting for.
NEUT36|Finally it's time for me to step in and buy Amazon.
BULL37|What a deal.
NEUT38|It's like I'm a prime member only on Wall Street.
NEUT39|No, I think this stock.
BEAR40|I hope this stock goes lower because I've sold a bunch of calls against it.
NEUT41|Will probably do more tomorrow, so anyway, that's my take on Amazon.
BULL42|Hope it works for you.
BULL43|"And I hope you're doing well."""
