NEUT0|"""Share schools be opened up full time, part time or not at all with a brand new academic year fast approaching and COVID-19 cases surging, the debate rages."
NEUT1|I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to navigate this ever changing world.
NEUT2|Discussions are getting intense over what approaches schools and colleges should take.
NEUT3|Some school districts want to offer in person instruction only a few days per week.
NEUT4|Fairfax County, Virginia, for example, has decreed that families must decide between totally remote learning or two days a week in the classroom.
NEUT5|New York City is announced that students will attend classes only two or three days a week and engage in remote learning on the other days, universities like Harvard and MIT.
NEUT6|Opting for total online learning.
NEUT7|No classroom attendance at all.
NEUT8|This kind of thing is nonsense.
NEUT9|Schools should be fully operational with instruction by live humans know staying closed or opening only part time.
NEUT10|The evidence is overwhelming.
NEUT11|Kids rarely get COVID-19, and if they do with highly unusual exceptions, they get a very mild version of it.
NEUT12|Moreover, kids hardly ever pass on the disease even if they themselves are infected.
NEUT13|And by the way, the Centers for Disease Control never recommended closing schools.
BEAR14|The hard truth is that too many children have suffered academic and emotional harm from the months long lockdowns that started in March.
BEAR15|Another factor not fully reopening schools disproportionately hurts low income families.
BEAR16|Parents have to miss work to look after the kids.
BEAR17|This is grossly unfair.
BEAR18|An absolutely unnecessary.
NEUT19|What about colleges?
NEUT20|Mass and proper distancing are all that are needed for classroom instruction.
NEUT21|Brown University, for example, essentially opening up this fall for incoming sophomores, juniors and seniors.
NEUT22|Freshman students will start in January and will also have to attend a summer semester that summer semester.
NEUT23|In fact, invites a fundamental, much needed discussion on why undergraduate education can't be completed in three years instead of the usual.
NEUT24|Four to six cycle that is normal today.
NEUT25|COVID-19 must not stand in the way of back to school.
NEUT26|Real school for the nation's young students.
NEUT27|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL28|Thanks for listening.
NEUT29|Do send in your comments and suggestions.
BULL30|"I look forward to being with you soon again."""
