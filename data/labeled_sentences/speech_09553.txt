NEUT1|We're talking about numbers for the Client Solutions Group.
NEUT2|Outstanding demand for notebooks, but I have to tell you, I think that this Michael Dell is a service is what I want to talk about because to me that's real value added.
NEUT3|So talk about some of the new things you're doing in order to make it so that people holistically want to choose Dell technologies.
BULL4|Sure, so you know we're embracing as a service and look if you look at our balance sheet, you'll see $28.7 billion in deferred revenue, up 11% and a lot of that is software licensing maintenance as a service.
NEUT5|And look we brought together the leaders and infrastructure, hardware, and software.

BULL9|It's work from home work from home we're seeing double digit growth in education, government and consumer.
BULL10|And you know, the online direct businesses are very strong.

NEUT12|So you gotta love that.
