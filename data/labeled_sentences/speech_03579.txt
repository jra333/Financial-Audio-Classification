NEUT0|"""OK, if you have a table of data in Google Sheets and you want to look at it by a certain type of date, let's say if you want to look at it by month."
NEUT1|Or you want to look at it by week.
NEUT2|The first thing that you want to do is create a pivot table so you'll notice that I've selected a cell within this table of data that I want.
NEUT3|The table goes down.
NEUT4|But Google Sheets will figure out that you want the whole thing as long as you're inside of it.
NEUT5|And make sure you don't have any blank rows.
NEUT6|Do data pivot table.
NEUT7|And this is going to summarize the data that's on sheet one, but it creates it on a new worksheet and what we want to do.
NEUT8|We want to start out with having the dates down the left hand side, and then we're going to group the dates.
NEUT9|Look at them in different ways, so we want the rows to be dates.
NEUT10|So do add date you want to look back at my table, this is a lot easier if you just have descriptive headers, so each one of these is telling me exactly what's in the column.
NEUT11|So on my dates on the left hand side and then I wanted to do it by item in each column.
NEUT12|So let's add items to the columns and then sheets.
NEUT13|Wants to know what to put in here, so I'm going to tell it.
NEUT14|Put the sum of the amount for each day in here 'cause I'm going to look at the sales so for the values add amount and it's smart enough to assume that you probably want this some.
NEUT15|And if you don't want these grand totals on here, you just take this check, mark off to not show totals were going on for what we're doing.
NEUT16|But they're easy to customize.
NEUT17|We're just going to do months, but it's going to work the same way as if you do weeks.
NEUT18|Come over to the column that has the days on it.
NEUT19|Select any one of the days, right click and do create pivot date Group doesn't matter what day you pick.
BULL20|It's going to do this for all of them.
NEUT21|Ann, you can do this by week, by month.
NEUT22|You can even do it by day the week.
NEUT23|But just to keep things easy will do month.
NEUT24|And it summarizes all of the data from sheet one into each month.
NEUT25|It's only work if you have them as valid dates.
NEUT26|So if you have if you have things in this column that aren't working right, go back to your data and make sure that these are valid.
NEUT27|There's several different ways to get validates and to check and make sure that they're working.
NEUT28|I'll put a link in the upper right hand corner here, so that's mostly it.
NEUT29|We've summarized this data by month with just a few clicks, and if you like that tutorial, there's a lot of others just like it.
NEUT30|If you subscribe to my channel in the lower right hand corner, you'll see them as they come out.
NEUT31|"Thanks, bye."""
