BULL0|"""So today DraftKings got a big lift from Madam, would head of Arc invest where she mentions why they are now invested in DraftKings."
NEUT1|Let's hear it, she has to say Draft Kings is becoming a platform for sports betting.
NEUT2|Yeah, the platform in the US or online sports betting.
NEUT3|They have major partnerships with the NHL, Major League Baseball, ESPN, Anmore.
BEAR4|But please continue states in crisis with huge deficits are going to capitulate one after another.
BULL5|Yeah, this is key.
BULL6|So in Covid State Scott had to take a lot of the financial burdens of the federal government, provide a whole lot of support for a lot of States and so states coffers were rated.
NEUT7|And so instead of raising income taxes on people, create new sources of income via sports betting.
BULL8|One of the most mature betting states.
BULL9|New Jersey, its revenues were up 100 percent, 100%.
NEUT10|That is huge.
NEUT11|So just like when marijuana got legalized or recreational ized in EU, Colorado, the first states many states didn't really come on board.
NEUT12|They want to see what's happening.
NEUT13|But once they start to see the tax revenue that was coming into Colorado, they all start to follow suit.
BEAR14|The genie was let out of the bottle and they could not put it back in.
NEUT15|New Jersey is to sports betting what Colorado was to marijuana becoming legalized or recreational ized in the US.
NEUT16|So in my opinion it's only a matter of time before the other states follow once they see a couple years of tax revenue collected by New Jersey, they're going to want in on the same game and they're going to start finding ways to legalize it.
NEUT17|Now.
NEUT18|Like I said last year when we bought DraftKings at $26.
NEUT19|Which you can see our video in the link in that top corner there couple of the key points that I wanted to mention was one.
NEUT20|Don't underestimate people's passion for sports too.
NEUT21|Don't underestimate their passion to gamble.
NEUT22|And when you put those two together, that becomes a very powerful stock to invest in.
BULL23|Now a couple other things that Kathy mentions in the video is how draft Kings has improved its margins and reduced its costs.
NEUT24|That was one of the big concerns or draft Kings because they were spending a lot per employee to get the revenue that they did.
NEUT25|Well.
BULL26|Now they've been figure out ways to reduce their cost basis and that's really going to hit profitability going forward now.
NEUT27|Disclosure, I am long shares on draft Kings right now.
NEUT28|I have a long term position on it.
NEUT29|I am planning on holding for at least three to six months, maybe again for the rest of the year.
NEUT30|It was my star performer last year.
NEUT31|We bought a 26, exited out about 54 of our full position and we plan on doing a similar trade this year and in my opinion with Arc now investment, they're just going to bring more attention to draft Kings.
NEUT32|Other players are going to look at it.
NEUT33|They're gonna start to want to come in.
NEUT34|They're going to start to put money on it.
BULL35|I think that's only going to help boost the price on DraftKings if you like this video, hit the bid.

NEUT37|"And I'll see you in the green."""
