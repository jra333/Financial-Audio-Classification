BEAR0|"""Breaking news for you."
NEUT1|We have reaction to Tesla's purchase of 1 1/2 billion dollars in Bitcoin from Tesla investor Ron Baron.
NEUT2|I will get this together in a statement for you quickly, but he said, you know Elon Musk has been commenting favorably about Bitcoin for awhile, so the announcement regarding Bitcoin, not surprising.
NEUT3|I assume Tesla is not speculating on the value of Bitcoin, but rather considers its payment system is up as a payment system.
NEUT4|He says when serious investors like Paul Turner Jones, Stan Druckenmiller and others.
BULL5|Think Bitcoin is affect is attractive and PayPal Pal also is building lots and assuming assuming use for payments he thinks he should have learned faster.
NEUT6|His ultimate comment though is I'm sure a lot of thought went into Bitcoin.
NEUT7|The Bitcoin purchase by Tesla and I look forward to learning the rationale, not saying whether he's in favor of it or not in favor of it.
NEUT8|But saying there's a lot here and he looks forward to learning more about the rationale behind it.
NEUT9|Well, I I'd take that was largely in favor of it.
NEUT10|Votive, maybe not outright vertical specifically, not to say he's in favor or not in favor.
NEUT11|That he wants to look into it a little more, but that he's not completely surprised given some of the Bitcoin fervor that's been out there and speculation around it.
NEUT12|And some of the talk that Elon has done about Bitcoin too.
NEUT13|No, I just say holding our hands up that I would have expected, potentially from, you know, traditional long, only investor like him.
BEAR14|The initial response could have been more negative.
NEUT15|So interesting.
NEUT16|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT17|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
