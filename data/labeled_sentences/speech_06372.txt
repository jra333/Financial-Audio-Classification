BULL0|"""Hey fools and welcome to another Motley Fool video."
NEUT1|My name is Chris Nails and welcome to part two of our two stocks to boost your retirement portfolio.
NEUT2|Now, last time, if you saw we actually spoke about if you had more than 10 years to retirement, but this time Jill is actually going to go through a little different, and that's if you've got less than 10 years.
NEUT3|So Jill, let's have a little recap of why we love dividends.
NEUT4|Sure thing First things first, they pay us real money.
NEUT5|For owning the shares holders, beautiful second thing a little bit of Peace of Mind, regardless of what the share price does.
NEUT6|If you only good solid dividend paying company, you're still going to get that dividend check every quarter every six months every year.
NEUT7|So hard to argue how it's working.
NEUT8|What's not to like?
NEUT9|I guess in that stage and as with everything investing Jill again, what's the risk?
NEUT10|There are three key risks I like to talk about when discussing dividend paying shares first.
NEUT11|Don't chase high yield if a yield seems like it's going to crush the market an it's.
NEUT12|Too good to be true, probably yes, yeah, absolutely.
BEAR13|The 2nd is a bad track record.
BEAR14|If a company has cut its dividend repeatedly, that's not a good sign and I would want to stay away from that type of stock.
NEUT15|And the third is look under the hood and check to make sure that the financials supporting that dividend or good.
BEAR16|If the company's balance sheet is weak, guess what's going to get cut if they hit tough time every time the dividend, absolutely.
NEUT17|So if you if you do have less than 10 years ago to retirement, let's have a bit of a reveal deal.
NEUT18|Can you think of any particular that you might want to have?
NEUT19|Absolutely.
NEUT20|So if you are within the decade of retirement, congratulations for us tomorrow.
BULL21|Yeah, but where we talked before about a longer timeline and being able to put some more growth into your portfolio.
NEUT22|I think the strategy now starts to shift to both growth and income.
NEUT23|So you're looking at more medium, yielding medium growth stocks.
NEUT24|Whereas before with a longer timeline we talked really about a low yield but a high growth idea.
NEUT25|So I've got two ideas.
NEUT26|OK, first one.
NEUT27|These are both big names here in the UK, the first one is Tesco.
NEUT28|TCO pays about 4% and we talk about medium yield.
BULL29|That's that's actually a pretty respectable yield, but it also has some growth built in because while Tesco's got a pretty good business here, it really is to me more exciting about what it's doing outside of the UK and if it gets that right.
NEUT30|So there's growth in that in that idea.
BULL31|OK, great.
NEUT32|So there was number one that was Tesco.
NEUT33|We're not going to sit around on that sticker.
NEUT34|Csco Jill #2.
BULL35|Well played pun there Chris.
NEUT36|Unilever ticker.
NEUT37|LLV are also pays a respectable yield of about 333 and a half percent somewhere in there again.
BULL38|Big solid company here.
NEUT39|However, it's going after emerging markets, so there's some growth baked in so it doesn't have.
NEUT40|You know 5-6 or even 7% yield, which we'll talk about in part three of the series.
BULL41|But it does have a solid yield.
NEUT42|A great source of income for people as they come toward retirement.
NEUT43|OK, so.
NEUT44|So you have it guys, there's another two for two portfolios there.
NEUT45|And like you said, next time we're going to talk about what to do if you're actually at retirement age.
BULL46|"So thank you very much for joining us and we'll see you next time."""
