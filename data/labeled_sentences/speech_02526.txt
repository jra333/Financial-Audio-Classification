NEUT0|"""If false, Brenda Matthews here, joined by Jason Moser this is our ask a full segment where we answer your questions so we've got a great question that comes from Lynn."
NEUT1|She asked do you stop loss orders if I get stopped out?
NEUT2|What is the best thing to do?
NEUT3|Buy back the stock or look elsewhere for another stock to trade?
NEUT4|So Jason, I know we typically don't endorse using stop loss orders.
NEUT5|I know this is something you've written about before.
NEUT6|What are your thoughts on lens question?
NEUT7|Yeah, for me personally man, I've been investing for many years and I have never.
NEUT8|Use the stop loss order to date.
NEUT9|Now, I won't say I'll never use it because things can possibly change, but I don't anticipate every using a stop loss order and for me it's just simply the fact that when I make an investment in a stock to begin with, I've done my due diligence number one.
BULL10|I feel comfortable making that investment.
NEUT11|What I have come to find here as technology has really taken over our lives with Facebook and Twitter and the free flow of information.
NEUT12|It was very fast and what we're seeing is the markets.
NEUT13|Are driven by virtually.
BEAR14|It seems like anything at this point in time, like a headline is tweet Iddan boom a stock and fall 5% in nothing is even happened.
NEUT15|So a lot of times you'll see you know stock prices move on news that's not really substantial to the long term success of the business.
BEAR16|And if you have a stop loss order set to where you're going to actually sell out of position if it falls a certain amount, well then you're you might very well be kicked out of a business that that over the long haul over five years to 10 years.
NEUT17|This may be a very successful investment and so for me I don't ever want to be stuck in that position one.
NEUT18|Forced to sell or sell selling because of some short term event that really doesn't have anything you know it didn't have anything to do with the long term success of the business.
NEUT19|I don't know if you have you ever used a stop loss.
NEUT20|I have not you stop loss orders and the thing that worries me about it is it's almost like a guaranteed way to lock in a loss, especially when you're dealing with volatile stocks and figuring out where to set it and something could happen.
NEUT21|And one of the things I think that I like to do is I like to make the decision on my own.
NEUT22|So even if a stock is down.
NEUT23|Maybe I'll sell it, but I want to look at it and think through.
NEUT24|I don't want to just be pushed out by my by my broker.
NEUT25|That's a good .1.
NEUT26|Last thing I will say is a stop loss.
BEAR27|Can very possibly eliminate an extremely attractive buying opportunity for you know if your urine on a stock that you really like and for whatever reason a bad quarter of ad headline or whatever that stock has a volatile day and falls 10 or 15%.
NEUT28|Stop loss orders going to completely get you out of that position.
NEUT29|Now if you don't have that stop loss order.
NEUT30|And you had the time to sort of look at the situation and determine this might be a good buying opportunity.
NEUT31|Then you can add more shares to that position you have at a cheaper price and so stop.
NEUT32|Loss orders can also really not only like you said lock you into a loss, but it can also eliminate any real potential opportunity of getting getting shares at a cheaper price as well.
NEUT33|So yeah, just not a big fan.
NEUT34|Yeah me neither.
BULL35|Thanks Jason.
