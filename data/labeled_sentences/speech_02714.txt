NEUT0|"""Joining me now on the Daily Ledger page 5 be from Nashville, TN."
NEUT1|Economic analyst, hedge fund manager and contributed Forbes and other major business publications.
NEUT2|Thomas Land, St Tom.
NEUT3|If Mueller had recommended an indictment which we can't, but let's just say for the sake of our movie, if he did make a case for indictment, I think that the US market certainly an probably global markets, would be in chaos right now.
NEUT4|It wouldn't be a good thing.
BULL5|On the other hand, we don't have that, and so this seems like this is a wonderful signal for the US economy too.
BULL6|They may be poised for even more growth.
NEUT7|Well, I'll tell you what it's gotta calm down.
BEAR8|A lot of the noise that would have torn away its sentiment because this would have led of course, to an impeachment.
NEUT9|And what would we have heard every single day?
BEAR10|It would have really torn at the shred shredded our.
NEUT11|I think our like I said sentiment in the markets as far as the stock market in the economy, I think that the markets at least had already decided there was no collusion, so it's really neutral to that.
BULL12|So now that there's no impeachment, of course, that's a huge positive.
NEUT13|Our next step would be trade.
BEAR14|I'm not that bullish as you know on the US economy, I gotta see first quarter numbers gram, we have a genuine slow down trade is a huge reason we've been prospering so well.
NEUT15|I'm not against Donald Trump's trade actions.
NEUT16|As you also know.
BEAR17|But I'm very worried about not worried, wary about the slow down.
BEAR18|I want to see the first quarter behind us, so As for the global economy, it's still pretty weak.
NEUT19|The next stop is trade.
BULL20|This strengthens his hands and trade.
NEUT21|As you may imagine, I think you'll get a little bit tougher now.
BEAR22|'cause he's got a tailwind?
BULL23|I think that's probably good in the end.
BEAR24|Not great for the economy necessarily right now and one of the red flags.
NEUT25|Maybe you're looking at?
NEUT26|Is this inverted yield curve?
BEAR27|And I don't want to get down in the weeds in that, but essentially it's when short term rates exceed long term rates, and this is one of the indicators potentially of a recession.
BEAR28|So we have a lot of people running around.
BEAR29|A recession is coming.
NEUT30|Recession is coming, but it's just one factor of many.
NEUT31|That's right, and by the way, correlation does not always lead to causation.
NEUT32|You could say that every recession predates an inverted yield curve.
NEUT33|It's just as easy to say.
NEUT34|Vice versa.
NEUT35|I don't think it's a very good indicator, honestly, but what it does say to me is short term rates.
NEUT36|Grammar too high.
NEUT37|the Fed needs to cut short term rates, something I've mentioned on your show numbers of times.
NEUT38|You and I discussed this.
BULL39|They did moderate their their aggressive increases.
NEUT40|I think they cut next.
NEUT41|Now we're talking.
NEUT42|Then we'll see a normalized economy.
NEUT43|And really some upside.
NEUT44|And on the other hand, mortgage rates are very, very low.
NEUT45|Right now.
NEUT46|It's a very favorable time to buy, so that's one sector of the economy again in 2019, could be poised for blastoff Thomas, thank you.
