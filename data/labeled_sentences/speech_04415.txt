NEUT0|"""You gotta look at energy, Jim."
BULL1|We mentioned it a few moments ago but Sector is going to open up 2% here.
NEUT2|Is this about reopening reflation or more about OPEC?
NEUT3|What OPEC plus said well I think it's about President Biden to President Biden because he's going to make it much more difficult to drill, which means there's going to be less oil coming from us.
NEUT4|The the math that OPEC plus did was 500,000 really didn't change the game.
NEUT5|There are people more people driving, but I do think that the idea that what President Trump wanted to do which is including.
NEUT6|Lasting legacy of wanting to drill up in Anwar, that's not something I care for you to do, but you know the president said kind of a drill everywhere guy but if you drill less we produce less oil goes up and so President elect Biden is doing so much more for the stocks of the oil companies than President Trump ever could.
NEUT7|I reiterate the Chevron with that great dividend.
NEUT8|An pioneer with that great growth are the two ways to play it.
NEUT9|If you believe that oil is going to go to the 50s.
NEUT10|I mentioned the dollar earlier this week, which I never do, and here I am again mentioning it twice in a week, but there's a reason for it.
NEUT11|I mean, it continued.
NEUT12|This continues to be a lot of conversation about it and the weakness that we've seen Jim.
NEUT13|We talked about.
NEUT14|Of course, currency translations for companies when that can reverse.
NEUT15|Oftentimes investors could care less about constant currency, at least when it's going against the companies.
NEUT16|But then when it can be a tailwind, it sometimes can be beneficial.
NEUT17|Right now.
BEAR18|Of course, if you're selling, it's not helping.
NEUT19|JNJ watched that one.
NEUT20|It's not just the vaccine, it's the dollar.
NEUT21|All the oil companies are being.
NEUT22|Oil is priced in dollars.
BULL23|It's great for them.
NEUT24|I think that you're going to see the first quarter.
NEUT25|A lot of the big exporters are going to tell you it's terrific, and since we're not allowed to go anywhere, you don't feel the downside.
NEUT26|Right now we're not filling the penny the the panelization of it of going abroad and and no, I think I think when you listen to the euro, the best beneficiary of J&J, yeah Apple.
BEAR27|Apple's lost billions to currency billions.
BEAR28|That's going to reverse Apple, even though the analysts all seemed to be lukewarm.
NEUT29|Other than Morgan Stanley about 5G.
NEUT30|Yes, 5G is not perfect yet.
NEUT31|You give it a break.
