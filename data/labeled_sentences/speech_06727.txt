BEAR1|Now, Amazon is currently a member of the IBD 50 and while some mega cap tech stocks are lagging after getting hit hard during the correction Amazon is holding above a recent by point.
NEUT2|So let's take a closer look.
BULL3|At this daily chart here now shares sold up as much as 36% from September through December, but they battled their way back and are now about 14% below their prior highs and you can see how Amazon retook and then found support at the 50 day line here, which is the red line now the black line, which is the 200 day line, was a resistance level, but that all changed.
BEAR4|Amazon's trading action developed a flat base within this larger consolidation.
BULL5|And the buy point is, at 1736, fifty one Amazon cleared that price on March 18th and has been able to hold above that level since, but with distribution days piling up for the major indexes, investors will want to watch for Amazon to continue to hold above the buy point and see if it finds support at the 200 day line.
BULL6|If it moves any lower from here now, the E Commerce giant has seen outstanding earnings growth in recent quarters.
BEAR7|And while that growth is expected to slow down due to tough year over year comparisons, 2019.
BULL8|Earnings are still projected to grow at 36% and then accelerate to 46% in 2020.
