BEAR16|Today there aren't really much news for this stock you know all you guys can see that it's going down.
BULL17|Going back up a little bit, but that's pretty much it.
BULL18|But one thing is need to understand is that this is a very hard penny stock right now, yes, and see that it has over 127 million in volume and is probably going to continue to go up, especially after this little pullback.
NEUT19|But let me know what do you think about this day?
NEUT20|I think it's still a buy, is it?
NEUT21|No, you don't.
NEUT22|We can't buy right now 'cause it's, you know there aren't any news.
NEUT23|But one thing's need to understand, you know, big investors.
NEUT24|You know that that or billionaires.
NEUT25|They always say this.
NEUT26|Don't invest in a company.
NEUT27|That you don't believe in.
NEUT28|In other words, owning listen to company that you just don't know what they do.
NEUT29|OK, always know what they do.
NEUT30|I always tell you guys what this company is about, but most importantly guys don't invest.
NEUT31|This is what they say.
NEUT32|Don't invest in a company when it's moving and there aren't any news.
NEUT33|OK, that is the riskiest thing ever, because the stock can keep going up and up, but if there aren't any news that they can just as fast as it goes up, it can pull back down as fast as you know, as fast as it went up.
NEUT34|So always keep that in mind.
NEUT35|So both forecasters.
