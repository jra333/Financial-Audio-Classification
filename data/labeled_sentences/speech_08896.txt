NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel to market trading here and today we're gonna be talking bout AMC Entertainment ticker symbol AMC Now in this video guys I'm going over why I think AMC could have one more big push to potentially hit the $9 range and also go over some big news revolving their options activity.

BULL5|To help you guys get better at the stock market and better at trading.
NEUT6|And also we show you guys what to look for in the stock market to help you guys pick the best stocks.
NEUT7|Also we give the best stock halts every morning and as you can see here last week we actually called out AMC to enter at $5.50 and exit at $8.00.
BULL8|And as you can see in today's AMC movements, AMC actually broke past $8.50 to be our price target.
NEUT9|So guys if you want shadow it's like this.
NEUT10|Make sure you guys get down below and hit that link.
BULL11|Also guys, let's get into the video now if we go ahead and take a look at AMC's charts we can see that they are up over 6.75% today and I am filming this 30 minutes before market close and as you can see here they did touch a high for the day of around $8.50 an right now they are currently pushing up to retest that resistance level which makes me want to believe going into tomorrow and the rest of the week that this stock could potentially hit that $9 or even $10 range.
NEUT12|Now guys if we look at the RSI you could see that the point where they start selling off.
BULL13|Is around the 71 RSI, and as you can see here, the stock is moving up, but the RSI is not even close to that 70 level yet.
BEAR14|I mean it is kind of close, but definitely not hitting those levels where they would sell off.
BEAR15|Now guys, if we go ahead and take a look at AMC's option chain we could see that there is some unusual activity here at the $7.00 and eight dollars strike price.
BEAR16|As you can see, the volume of the amount of contracts held right now are just insane.
NEUT17|So this means that it's pretty bullish that people are thinking that it is going to touch seven $8.00, which it currently.
BEAR18|Is at right now and if we go ahead and take a look at the puts, you can see that the volume is way way low compared to the calls right here and now guys that makes me want to believe if this many people are holding this amount of contract.
NEUT19|Still as the stock is going up and as you can see here, even at the $9 and $10 strike price, there are still a good amount of people buying and holding these contracts.
NEUT20|So going into the rest of this week, there could just be one more push in AMC where?
NEUT21|Touches that $10 level and then pulls back.
NEUT22|Now we go back and take a look at AMC's charts guys.
NEUT23|A couple of key levels that I would be looking at or like I said earlier, the $8.00 and 4345 Cent line.
NEUT24|And as you can see if we pull back the charts.
NEUT25|This happened to be a level of resistance.
NEUT26|Probably back.
NEUT27|I want to say a week or two ago and as it's pushing up as you can see here, I think it's just myopia.
BULL28|Up adjusted guys.
NEUT29|I'm filming this live right now 20 minutes before market close and it just broke that resistance.
BULL30|So guys, this is a really good sign for the bull run that, like I said earlier, could hit those $9 or even $10 price targets at the end of this week because so many people are still holding their contracts and nobody's really selling out.
BULL31|This is going to be a really good indicator that it's going to just keep running guys.
NEUT32|So guys like I mentioned earlier, that $10 price target is going to be our resistance and I think at the end of the week if it does touch $10, I think that's where most people are going to be selling off.
NEUT33|So guys, if you enjoyed the video, make sure you guys get down below.
NEUT34|Hit that thumbs up button.
NEUT35|And also let me know down in the comments what you guys think about AMC going to 2021 and all that.
