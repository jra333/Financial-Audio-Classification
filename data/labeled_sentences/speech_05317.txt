NEUT0|"""Hey guys, it's CP investing here in today."
NEUT1|I'm gonna be talking about where I think Neil's price is going to go in the short term and in the long term so.
BULL2|Right now Neil Neil's been doing pretty well.
NEUT3|The price is a 4868.
BULL4|On it's gone up basically 4% today.
BEAR5|14% this past week, it's down 4% this month and up 163% last three months and 1676% this year.
BEAR6|So it's down.
BEAR7|It's down from its previous highs.
BEAR8|Its previous highs were 5699, about a month ago and then it kind of went down with all the news about the stock dilution them offering U.S. stocks at $39.00.
BEAR9|I think it was 68 million, so that's why I dropped all the way down to 39.
NEUT10|And then there's other news about the delisting that kind of scared.
NEUT11|Investors but.
NEUT12|No.
BULL13|There's a lot of positive and bullish momentum for Neil.
NEUT14|There's a catalyst coming up on.
NEUT15|No January 9th.
NEUT16|January 9th 8th and that's Neil De and Neil Neil is going to be coming out with the big news.
NEUT17|I believe they're going to talk about two sedans.
NEUT18|People have theories about what else they're going to drop.
NEUT19|They could be expanding to Europe or to other countries.
BULL20|X Ping is already expanding to other countries, and I believe Neil is going to be also expanding, 'cause I think Neil is going to be.
NEUT21|Uhm?
NEUT22|The number one.
NEUT23|Uhm?
NEUT24|Electric vehicle company in China.
BULL25|I think it's going to be more popular in China than Tesla is.
NEUT26|And I think Neil could possibly come.
NEUT27|Move over to America if it gets bigger.
NEUT28|'cause Neil is more than just a car company, it's.
NEUT29|Also, like a lifestyle, there's like Neo houses and they just they just made 203 neo houses.
BULL30|Which is which is great for the company and its festersen us.
NEUT31|So yeah, I I have two calls.
BEAR32|I bought this call when it Neil drop down to 41.
NEUT33|When it was on its downturn, which is really good, those one of my better plays and I just bought this this other call for.
BULL34|Ending it like the February 19th I just bought at the end of the day, so it's down a little bit, but overtime I believe this this is going to be up 'cause I believe in Neal Ann.
BULL35|I think it's going to do well, so by January.
NEUT36|8th or 9th by Neo Day, I believe that Neil is going to be around $60.00.
NEUT37|It's high before is 57, so I could see it getting stuck at 57 and depending on the news that comes out it can skyrocket or kind of plateau or even drop and then for the long term by the end of 2021 I believe that Neil is going to be a 3 digit stock and by that I mean it's going to be $100.
NEUT38|That's what I believe in.
NEUT39|So I'm very bullish on Neo.
NEUT40|An I'm not a financial advisor, I do.
NEUT41|Do your own due diligence.
NEUT42|Do your own research.
NEUT43|Yeah, so if you guys would like to see more videos on Neo or my thoughts on other Starbucks let me know and thank you for watching the video.
