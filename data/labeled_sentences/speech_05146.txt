BULL5|It went up again with the same and again that the San I'm hoping to do look for the next support to go along, which already did and started going up.
NEUT6|So I'm looking to go long here in this specific trade I'm trying to do a swing trade and I like to take profit at the level 540 to be on the safe side and if you go back you could see a good support resistant take profit at this level.
