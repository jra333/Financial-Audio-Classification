BEAR0|"""I just have this like memory ingrained into my head."
NEUT1|This is a question that our team asked me more recently actually and my answer to that and what I've realized is, I think, critical to the company.
NEUT2|Success is whenever I feel stuck, I start and it sounds very interesting.
NEUT3|If it's, it's almost like a paradox.
NEUT4|Whenever I get stuck with big, really difficult challenges, the most difficult part is actually starting and whether I start completely wrong.
NEUT5|That whole always helps guide my path.
NEUT6|Whether it's just like writing something down on a piece of paper and a notebook, or you know if I've got a tough like decision to make the first thing that I do is just like start writing everything down.
NEUT7|And I think that's one of the habits that I've always had.
BULL8|The biggest compliment that I've ever received.
NEUT9|You know, when I first started my journey into entrepreneurship, I was and I still actually am living with my mom and I basically said mom, I'm gonna.
NEUT10|I'm going to quit my job and I'm going to start working on upkeep full time and she was like why do you want to do that?
NEUT11|And I was like Mom going to change the world.
NEUT12|I just have this like memory ingrained into my head where my mom's like.
BULL13|Fine, how are you going to change the world with Justin AB and we just raised our Series B raise about 50 million bucks and you know she saw me and Forbes and saw me in the tech crunch and she was like wow Ryan I'm like really I'm really proud of you.
NEUT14|You know I think you are starting to change the world and I take back what I said.
BULL15|I think that it's totally possible and you're well on your way for the younger generations.
NEUT16|And people like thinking about getting into entrepreneurship.
NEUT17|It's basically this idea that like.
NEUT18|You know, hey, there are thousand ideas out there.
NEUT19|There are thousand great ideas out there and we talked about all the naysayers that say like hey, these are all the different reasons why it won't work.
NEUT20|You know, listen to them.
NEUT21|But you know, guide your guide to make your own decisions, because again, it's not about the 99 reasons why an idea won't work.
NEUT22|It's about the one reason why it will work.
NEUT23|Try to find that.
NEUT24|Try to hold true to that.
NEUT25|Go super deep into a problem and I guarantee you if you do that and you do that with a ton of passion.
NEUT26|Grit you're going to help shape or change the world.
NEUT27|It's really the jump to go full time into upkeep.
NEUT28|I was working a full time job as an iOS developer.
NEUT29|I was building upkeep on the nights and weekends and I was just doing this out of passion is kind of like a side hobby for myself and then one day my friend was like hey Ryan, you should quit your job at work on upkeep full time because I think you have something that was really difficult decision because I'd never thought of entrepreneurship as like.
NEUT30|The ultimate goal for me.
NEUT31|I just absolutely loved building when he said that it kind of made me realize, like, OK, cool like I have this shot.
BULL32|I have an opportunity.
BULL33|"I've already built something."""
