NEUT0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to daily stock picks with Jeff tonight."
NEUT1|I've got 2 picks first time in awhile and I'm happy to bring them to you.
NEUT2|So let's do this.
NEUT3|Alright guys, the first pick for tomorrow is Celanese Corp ticker symbol CE.
BULL4|Now Celanese Corp is in the business of production and sale of industrial chemicals and just after hours tonight they announced year over year over year for the quarter sales increase of 26%.
NEUT5|Additionally, they completed their acquisition of Omni Plastics this quarter, and certain business segment as I was looking into it, the business segment of Acetyl Industrials.
BULL6|I believe it was revenues on that were up 10X year over year.
NEUT7|Now I'm guessing that's related to the acquisition of Omni Plastics.
NEUT8|I don't know for sure yet.
BULL9|I wasn't able to break that out just yet, but it's interesting their their sales are increasing fairly strongly and it's just really it's really notable, so I think the market is going to catch up on that.
NEUT10|So for tomorrow I have a buy price of $111.00 a share.
NEUT11|And I'm actually looking to get.
NEUT12|I think it might run tomorrow to 100 and $18220 a share.
NEUT13|Now I'm not 100% on that.
NEUT14|But that's just what it's looking like given the numbers.
NEUT15|Alright, the other pick for tomorrow is a company I'm sure we're all aware of, and that company is Netflix ticker symbol NFLX.
NEUT16|Now Netflix is is sort of a love hate relationship for me.
BULL17|I think the company is obviously doing fantastic, but I feel the price of the stock is.
NEUT18|Really, really expensive relative to what you're getting for it.
BULL19|That being said, I think the stock is going to keep going up, so for tomorrow I'm looking at a buy price of 315.
BULL20|Actually looking for a pullback.
NEUT21|Anecelle price of 3/22 to 3/25.
BEAR22|It's going to keep going up.
