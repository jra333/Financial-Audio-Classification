NEUT1|Let's talk about two stocks that must be purchased for video streaming services, Disney and Roku.
BEAR2|Like many entertainment and travel companies, Disney struggled to close many theme parks during the COVID-19 pandemic.
BEAR3|The Corona virus pandemic has hurt Disney's operating income by $2.4 billion.
NEUT4|However, Disney Plus is now Disney savior.

BULL8|On the other hand, compared to Disney plus, Netflix is now the market leader with 195 million subscribers.
BULL9|Remarkable pricing, power and consistent growth in international markets.
BULL10|But Roku's future high growing potential is more attractive to us.
NEUT11|Roku runs a totally different advertising business model by helping users avoid logging into different streaming platforms to view different content.
NEUT12|Roku allows users to watch paid and free content from the Internet, such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, YouTube, etc.
NEUT13|The only thing Roku streaming devices and TV needs is an Internet connection to get going.
BEAR14|Like all other stocks, this one was pressured lower in February and March after the coronavirus made landfall in the US.
BEAR15|From peak to trough, Roku tumbled more than 60%.
BULL16|The stock's 450% rally from its March bomb, however, ultimately led to a gain of 137% for the year.
NEUT17|A $1000 investment made in Roku on the 1st Trading Day of this year would now be worth a whopping $2367.
BULL18|Stay at home efforts meant to curb the Corona virus turned out to be a boon for Roku.
