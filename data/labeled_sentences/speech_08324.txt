NEUT0|"""When Christine, what's going on which it is December 4th, 2020 and we have the market officially closed, so the SMP close at 3699 twelve and that is very close to a record high and the record high is 3699 twenty."
BEAR1|So we're eight cents off of that for the closed today so.
NEUT2|If you've been following the law.
BULL3|You know that I've been bullish on the market and I started in September doing this and I've been saying since then at the market was going to continue to move higher and gets a new highs.

NEUT6|Alright, so let's happen to what the SNP is doing alright?
NEUT7|SMP we're looking at the sharp as you can see already talked about the highs.
NEUT8|Those are all the levels we identified in the past, so let's go ahead and do something new.
NEUT9|Let's go to our drawing set and we're going to go up to 3800 alright and a reason why we're going to 3800 is because if you notice, each range isn't about $200 range, right?
NEUT10|So let's go ahead and keep the math simple and go to around 38.
NEUT11|Alright, so?
NEUT12|I think I've said before that my price target is 4000 or not too far away from there.
NEUT13|My next price target right now for it to get to is 38, so that is the SNP.
NEUT14|Let's go ahead and check out the Russell.
NEUT15|Alright, let's go ahead and look at the Russell.
BULL16|Ann Russell is what I have said will lead the market higher.

BEAR18|So Russell now is at highs.
NEUT19|It closed at one 8820 that is IWM and the record high is one 8845 made today so the market closed for the week at his highs and I'm looking forward to continue to make that move.
