NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol disp Disney."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint, I do own Disney in my retirement accounts from the long side, so just keep that in mind as I go through the video.
NEUT5|Quite the eventful day today with earnings not to be, you know.
NEUT6|So make sense why there is well above average volume.
NEUT7|But now that the dust has settled, there are some very very interesting areas to watch.
NEUT8|From the trading standpoint.
NEUT9|And before I go any further, I do want to note that I'm not trying to come across like I have some sort of special skill or that this is some sort of great discovery.
NEUT10|Quite the opposite, actually.
NEUT11|I sure you people that use charts and understand charts have taken notice of a couple of these levels and I make that comment because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same things called a self fulfilling prophecy.
NEUT12|Call whatever you want.
NEUT13|It can produce some very dynamic movements and the one level that everybody.
NEUT14|I mean so many people are going to be watching, going into tomorrow is $100.50.
NEUT15|If you go through the history of the chart you can see acted as support.
NEUT16|ACTED as support, roughly speaking, acted as support mid afternoon and then the final 30 minutes price essentially bounced right off that area.
NEUT17|Actually, I'm curious what was the official over the last 30 minutes.
NEUT18|155 so 150 is going to be a level that lots of people are watching, especially the shorts shorts are going to be watching and rightfully so.
NEUT19|You know what?
NEUT20|If that level goes on there an can it fail?
NEUT21|Because if it does fail, I mean no such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT22|But like I said, it's at least a valid rational thought to think that that could then create.
BEAR23|Additional downward pressure so 150 is going to be a level that so many people are going to be watching myself included.
BEAR24|If 150 is violated, then we no such thing as a guarantee, but it would not be shocking to see the price then ventured down to the $99 area if not even lower than that.
NEUT25|So those are going to be the two main areas of support to watch going forward.
BULL26|As far as resistance.
NEUT27|Keep it on that purple line right there.
NEUT28|The 50.
BULL29|Moving average that's been doing a good job of kind of forecasting where the sellers have been.
NEUT30|But really the main dynamic going into tomorrow.
NEUT31|Is can the price stay above that 150 mark or not?
NEUT32|So let's see what happens with it.
NEUT33|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT35|But it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL38|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT45|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
