NEUT0|"""Hello Friends, welcome to episode 14 of Stock market technical analysis."
BEAR1|I'm other therefrom mostly bearish as of now in the playlist stock market technical analysis we have covered these topics.
NEUT2|If you missed out on any of these videos, make sure you watch them because every video is about a precise candle and what it means today we're going to be talking about another 2 candle stick pattern that is a bearish pattern.
NEUT3|We're going to be talking about dark cloud cover.
NEUT4|The last episode was about piercing pattern and dark cloud cover is opposite of the piercing pattern.
NEUT5|So let's take a look at how this pattern looks.
NEUT6|Also will be looking at this pattern on charts to get a better understanding.
NEUT7|And how it works.
NEUT8|So what you see right now is a set up of a dark cloud cover pattern.
NEUT9|The prior trend has to be upwards for this pattern to work, so when you see a big green candle followed by a big red candle which is piercing through from the top to bottom, this is what we call a dark cloud cover.
BEAR10|So what this shows is that the sellers have pushed the prices down.
NEUT11|There is interest in selling at these particular levels, so the prior trend is upwards and then this pattern appears.
NEUT12|We chose the power of sellers as I always say candle stick patterns are based on prices and how they close during a particular time frame.
NEUT13|So the pattern you need to realize may look a little different on charts, mainly because the prices vary, but the basic concept is this.
NEUT14|Let's take a look on the charts.
NEUT15|What happens when this kind of pattern appears?
NEUT16|So what you're seeing right now is a chart which has a dark cloud cover right here.
BEAR17|So the prior trend was upwards and then there was a dark cloud cover.
BEAR18|Right, the prices were pushed down.
NEUT19|Now if you keep this as a high if you see that price did not come since then, the prices started moving downwards.
NEUT20|This is the concept of the dark cloud cover.
NEUT21|It is opposite of piercing pattern that we discussed in the previous episode.
NEUT22|I'm leaving a link right here.
NEUT23|If you have missed out on that.
NEUT24|This pattern usually shows powers of bears or the sellers.
NEUT25|I hope today's videos clear.
NEUT26|We learned about dark cloud cover pattern.
NEUT27|Try to search this kind of a pattern on charts and see what is actually happening.
NEUT28|This will give you an understanding when and where these kind of patterns work.
