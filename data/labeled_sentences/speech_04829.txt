NEUT0|"""Well, the man known as medic over his real name is been yes and a recent said in his first TV interview that he was prepared to pay even more for that $69 million people, NFT that sold at Christie's earlier this month and he said NFTS are creating a revolution to democratize the art and the entire collecting world."
NEUT1|We didn't make sure that we have a higher limit.
NEUT2|Definitely I was I was.
BULL3|I was very motivated and ready to go even beyond what we paid for it at this auction at that point.
NEUT4|And I just believe that it is that important of a piece in history artistry.
NEUT5|This is a significant piece in art history, and sometimes these things take some time for everyone to recognize and realize.
NEUT6|But, but I'm OK with that.
NEUT7|I had the opportunity to be be part of this very important change or shift in how art has been perceived for centuries.
NEUT8|News also today that the under bidder for that $69 million people is Justin Sun.
NEUT9|He is launching a fund for NFTS priced at over $1,000,000 an just moments ago guys a group of major blockchain players including Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin, launching a new NFT network they say is 99% more energy efficient than Ethereum energy.
NEUT10|Of course being a huge criticism right now of thefts in blockchain, the platform they're launching is called palm.
NEUT11|And it's going to start with artist Damien Hirst selling a series of 10,000 oil paintings that he painted five years ago, and he's going to launch all of these on this new platform, so this speaks to both the growth growth as well as this kind of backlash that we started to see against the environmental impact of NFTS and blockchain guys.
NEUT12|Robert, Great, get an way to spin the story forward.
BULL13|Appreciate that very much.
NEUT14|Robert Frank.
NEUT15|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT16|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
