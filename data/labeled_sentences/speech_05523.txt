BULL0|"""Disney plus is an unbelievable deal for $7.00."
NEUT1|And people are still not paying as much as $14.00 for Netflix.
NEUT2|The the measure is that people consumers are going to have a few streaming services with the budget as much as 30 to $40 a month, which buys you a lot of content.
NEUT3|And if you get the whole Disney bundle that includes Disney plus, ESPN Plus and Hulu, you get a lot of content for $13.00 right there.
NEUT4|And this creates Disney's Direct connection with the consumer and the fact that they can.
NEUT5|Also add a paper view option and launch a Premier movie like Mulan is is also a powerful tool.
BULL6|I think that they will get a lot of takers on this movie.
BULL7|It has been a widely anticipated movie.
NEUT8|It's been.
BEAR9|Delayed twice or postponed twice because of the pandemic and power, it would have been a blockbuster in the in the theaters so people would have went to see it in the theaters.
NEUT10|And when you figure the cost of that, it's a pretty good deal at $30 at home.
NEUT11|I think it does make me wonder, though, if they're almost setting a new normal here in terms of standards, and if people if Milan does go well.
BEAR12|If the loan must be eating into future earnings, they could have had at the box office because the consumer will demand more of these releases at home.
BULL13|I would benefit Disney if they did it.
NEUT14|They went direct to consumer.
BULL15|There was talk from a of simultaneous premieres of Intheir and at home too.
NEUT16|As much as 50 to $100, which again is still cheap when you figure what it takes to buy 4 tickets, which in New York is North of $20 a ticket.
NEUT17|Plus popcorn, candy and soda, it could be North of 150 to $200 to go see a movie today.
NEUT18|Consumers have incredible home theater setups and.
BULL19|This may be the right time that's meeting the convergence of the quality of consumers home theaters with the simultaneous or direct consumer release of Premier movies.
NEUT20|It's that popcorn that always gets you right?
NEUT21|I mean, the only place in the world that they can charge you ten $1215 for a big tub of popcorn.
NEUT22|But I've been bottom line here.
NEUT23|Should Netflix be worried?
NEUT24|I think Netflix should have been worried for a long time.
NEUT25|Netflix had the space all to themselves for almost eight years and you have a lot of great competitors and if you look at the market value of Netflix, it's still more than Disney.
NEUT26|And Disney gives you not only Disney Plus which I think at some point will overtake Netflix in total global subscribers plus the parks plus the cruise lines plus the studios plus.
NEUT27|The TV networks, I mean you get a lot as an investor.
NEUT28|You get a lot of entertainment value production value for your money.
NEUT29|I mean it's still Disney and content is King.
NEUT30|"So in streaming services content is King and Disney is the King of content and that's the key driver because that's what causes consumers or drives consumers to sign up for this subscription services."""
