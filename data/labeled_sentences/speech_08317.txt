NEUT0|"""Yo, when Christine was going on, it is Saturday morning."
NEUT1|February 20th, 2021.
BEAR2|And yes, the market is closed.
BEAR3|So yeah, I'm a little bit behind.
NEUT4|Took some time off we took a week off.
NEUT5|Had a heavy set back in my life, but that's alright.
BULL6|We move forward, so let's jump right into the market alright.
NEUT7|SMP and the Russell so we can actually take a look at the Russell first, let's take a look at what the week did.
NEUT8|So last time I was on here I was looking at the market to try to pull back a little bit and that was my prediction in.
NEUT9|Clearly that did not happen.
NEUT10|Not at all.
BULL11|The market continued to bounce.
BULL12|It pulled back and hit this level here.
BEAR13|Anjeza marched higher and they got to a high of two 3033 an now we continue to see this trend has been being followed very tightly, so I'm not going to do anymore predictions.
NEUT14|If I didn't learn my lesson from way back when in like 2012 and all that I need to learn my lesson now, no predictions, we're going to follow the market until it falls apart.
NEUT15|So if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
BULL16|We got bounces when we got here another bounce.
NEUT17|So until we see this fail, that's the only time we need to worry.
NEUT18|Until then, keep riding.
NEUT19|So market.
NEUT20|Target 240 250 is where I think it can eventually get to.
NEUT21|Will it get there before the market pulls back?
NEUT22|There will never know, so right now we're going to continue to look at things to be bullish and we have every signal in our favor.
BEAR23|So the market made this move lower touched our moving average and now it is showing signs of getting ready to bounce.
NEUT24|So I look for the market to continue to do what.
NEUT25|Let's bounce again.
NEUT26|Alright, so that is the Russell.
NEUT27|Let's take a check on the SMP Zero SMP similar right?
BULL28|We had our emotions higher.
BULL29|We had our grind higher.
NEUT30|Everything that I've said as coming to fruition except for last week that I was on or I was looking for things to pull back and pulled back and hit this level and now it's starting to trend a little sideways.
BULL31|But we have our moving average ready to maybe take things higher again so.
NEUT32|As well looking for is not broken.
BULL33|You've seen it happen many of times where it traded sideways and you know got a little WAVY, but we continue to ride that wave higher.
NEUT34|So I'm looking for the market to continue next week.
NEUT35|Why not?
NEUT36|We've got no other reasons to say that it can't, so that's the summary for this week.
