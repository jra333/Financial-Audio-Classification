BEAR0|"""Alright, so I think Dave people didn't understand your model."
NEUT1|I I saw you and said this could be like some of these Chinese fintech companies where they have 26 million users overnight and then it doubles.
NEUT2|The fact is is that upstart is on a path that no other lending company is ever been on this country because of AI, isn't it?
NEUT3|Yeah, we're really one of the first.
NEUT4|Certainly in the US, to apply AI to the problem of lending, which is just an enormous market opportunity.
BULL5|And obviously a very cutting edge modern technology that that can do a lot of good.
NEUT6|And before I even get to this new acquisition and how good the quarter was, I want to say up front that you guys had thought all about the possibilities of people being left behind by AI before you even addressed the profits.
NEUT7|You thought about this to be sure that people aren't.
NEUT8|Aren't disenfranchised, correct?
NEUT9|Yeah, we founded the company nine years ago really to improve access to credit.
NEUT10|So the idea of being fair and being inclusive is sort of ingrained in us in the very beginning and we test our platform.
NEUT11|In fact, we test every applicant in every loan for fairness, admit to make sure there is not bias and we share the results of those tests every quarter with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau so that that notion of fairness and inclusiveness is very central to who we are.
NEUT12|And by the way, just people know there's no.
NEUT13|This is not a company that has credit risk, but at the same time you care tremendously about your credits and they turn out to be pretty darn good.
NEUT14|Yeah, we're not a lender ourselves.
BULL15|We partner with Banks who want to have better, more effective, more inclusive and more profitable consumer lending offerings.
NEUT16|And that means we don't take on credit risk ourselves.
NEUT17|We provide the technology to these banks for fees, so we're a fairly simple fee based business.
BULL18|But of course we want our banks to perform.
BULL19|We want their businesses to be successful, so we care a lot about the accuracy of our models, and that's very central to our success as well.
