NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys back on this video today there's a video will be about Pfizer ticker symbol, PFE makes you guys like this video and leave a comment below."
NEUT1|Hit that subscribe button for the YouTube algorithm I do post everyday at 1:00 PM and I also put some videos in between there.
NEUT2|Give you guys updates an at 8:00 PM is usually my top stocks for the next day that I'll be looking at so make sure you check those out too.
NEUT3|OK so I'm talking bout fighters today.
NEUT4|This would be a quick update on this job that has been happening.
BEAR5|I was looking for this drop because of this run up here every time.
BEAR6|I always tell you guys when you see a run up you want to see a drop to notice a healthy uptrend.
BEAR7|It has been dropping for a consistent days now.
NEUT8|Maybe like 123456 days in a row and haven't reached support.
NEUT9|I was looking for support to be at these highs.
NEUT10|These pre market after market highs around 3753.
BEAR11|We we hit the 3773 market had a little bounce, so I'm trying to see if we stay above these highs and if we do I will test this as support and looking to make a little higher highs but this drop has been because a health worker in Alaska experience electric electric allergic reactions after getting the vaccine from Pfizer.
NEUT12|So like I said in my previous video, you have to watch out for the reactions or allergic reactions to people taking the vaccine.
NEUT13|'cause that will have a big play on the stock which it is now.
BEAR14|It has been dropping for previous days so as more like news comes out on the vaccine whether good or bad, it will determine where the stock moves.
NEUT15|So make sure you watch out for the news 'cause this bad the stock and drop and if it's good the stock will go up.
BEAR16|But I still do think this is a healthy downtrend.
BULL17|It hasn't broken any of my support levels yet to turn resistance, so just some levels you guys should be looking out for 70 or 37.5 level.
NEUT18|But look at that level to make US support.
NEUT19|If it breaks that.
NEUT20|If it breaks it 37.5 level the next level I'd be looking for support is the 37 even number, and if it breaks that support, I'll be looking for prices to go all the way down to around 35 level and once we get closer to that I'll make another video.
NEUT21|But those are my support levels, so I want to see just to recap 37.537.
NEUT22|And if we go below that.
NEUT23|35.5 Build a support levels and if we do hold support at 37.5 I'll be looking for resistance at the 39.5 so I actually will do a play on that to get that little $2.00 move on a call option.
NEUT24|It Pfizer does host support there so we're just going to keep watching it.
NEUT25|I'll keep making updates so you guys can.
NEUT26|Speiser is moving big right now and the news is critical to the stock.
NEUT27|OK hope you guys enjoy the videos.
BULL28|Enjoyed the support levels.
NEUT29|Just keep an eye on it.
NEUT30|And always remember, there's not a recommendation seller by anything this for educational purposes only showing you guys how I'm looking at it and how I'm going about this talk.
NEUT31|So don't try anything you see or hear on the videos.
