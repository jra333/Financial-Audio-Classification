NEUT0|"""Either let's talk 1st about what's going on in Washington."
NEUT1|As it seems to have really been the driver behind equity markets, and I wonder how much it has to do also with the weaker dollar.
BEAR2|The Bloomberg Dollar Index down at 11:20.
NEUT3|Yeah, we've seen you know, just this kind of unrelenting optimism from equity markets and that kind of constant narrative of positive equities.
BEAR4|Weaker dollar to since we playing out and everyone is very much focused on this US fiscal stimulus deal that were entered closing.
NEUT5|Do I have to say it?
NEUT6|These kind of very extended levels at the dollar index, who were a little bit worried and it could be a case of kind of you buy the rumor, sell the fact we've seen you very extended positioning in the dollar?
NEUT7|Kind of an.
BEAR8|Unrelenting kind of bullish equity market run.
BEAR9|Only think that degree of market optimism is now a little bit complacent and and we are worried about a pullback.
NEUT10|Yeah, I mean if you look at weather good morning team, if you look at where the dollar is now, what do you think it is responding to overnight?
BEAR11|I mean it is so much weaker, down 6/10 of a percent on dxy, which is actually quite a big move overnight for this time of the European session.
BULL12|And these broadbase the rally on the other side, so the euros higher the pound is higher.
NEUT13|We know reasons behind that one.
NEUT14|Of course the Aussie.
NEUT15|The New Zealand dollar, some of the emerging market currencies as well.
NEUT16|Is it something that the Fed did or didn't do?
BEAR17|Or is it just the the move into riskier assets just continues to drive the dollar weaker?
NEUT18|Are you absolutely right?
NEUT19|It's just equities.
NEUT20|I mean, arguably, yes, yeah, we got them from the Fed was a lot less store base that we're expecting.
NEUT21|I mean substantially.
NEUT22|Was there, you know, and help for guidance.
NEUT23|So I think it actually is appointed dublish market expectations.
BEAR24|I will only say it's just the story of, you know, Huey Access Global liquidity and it's just driving stocks higher and driving a weaker dollar.
NEUT25|We do thinking of that.
NEUT26|Optimism is kind of a risk to to anything there.
NEUT27|For example, if there's.
NEUT28|Issues with vaccine take up.
NEUT29|"You know if there's kind of adverse side effects, you know, once we get the vaccine trials and they're subjected to the rigors of peer review, you know, will that kind of market optimism suspected to hit a roadblock?"""
