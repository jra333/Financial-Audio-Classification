BEAR0|"""Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax the wealthiest Americans with her wealth tax could reduce US growth."
BULL1|They're saying by 1.2% over the next 30 years, according to the Penn Wharton Budget Model analysis.
BEAR2|The Ultra Millionaire tax could also cut GDP by 8 tenths of a percent in 2040 and reduce 20 and reduce hourly wages by 1.2% by 2050.
NEUT3|David this is, according to Penn Warren.
NEUT4|Your thoughts on the impact of taxes?
NEUT5|Sure this has been tried before.
NEUT6|This is not a new concept that's been tried by several countries.
NEUT7|They've repealed it look I'll be the first to admit the current tax code is 77,000 pages long and needs revamping most of those pages are dedicated on how to avoid paying taxes in the 1st place, but go after the low hanging fruit go after things like carried interest go after things like the 1031 exchange, where you can avoid paying taxes for a lifetime.
NEUT8|You know at some point we're going to have a conversation on taxing capital the same as income, but this is not.
NEUT9|It it will not work.
NEUT10|There's no market price.
NEUT11|There's no market price for a private business.
NEUT12|And what happens if you pay a tax on unrealized gain that turns into a loss?
NEUT13|You're going to give the money back.
NEUT14|I doubt it.
NEUT15|It's already spent.
BULL16|Steve Forbes jump in here on this tax conversation because we are expecting the bite administration to implement the highest and most significant tax increases that we've seen after we saw the tax cuts of the Trump administration really move the needle on economic growth.
NEUT17|What are you expecting, Steve?
BULL18|Yeah, well, David said is a good argument for the simple flat tax, but this array of taxes I'm surprised the market is held up as much as it has big tax increases are going to come.
NEUT19|That's the consensus.
NEUT20|Now that's going to whack this recovering economy, so you have that in David to how do we finance these gargantuan deficits without a return of inflation?
NEUT21|How do we avoid stagflation?
NEUT22|Stagnation of the economy?
NEUT23|Inflation?
BEAR24|You're hurting the economy.
NEUT25|You're printing a lot of money.
NEUT26|Why does the market still floating like this?
BULL27|David, it is interesting that markets haven't responded to this debt, and the idea that taxes are going higher at some point.
NEUT28|Do you expect a reaction?
NEUT29|David Nelson.
NEUT30|Yeah, what I think sleep is saying is very true.
NEUT31|Inflation is here, it's everywhere.
NEUT32|It's at the pumps.
BULL33|It's look at the PM eyes around the world are rising.
BEAR34|We have bottlenecks around the world.
NEUT35|This flood of capital at this point is only going to drive inflation higher the fake can talk a great game, but the markets aren't buying that we've seen 10 year yields continue to move and at some point that becomes an investable asset class.
NEUT36|At some point you're going to have to pay for that, and equity holders of equity will start to move into other asset classes.
NEUT37|And you already seen in commodities at all time highs.
NEUT38|For many of them, energy continues to rise.
NEUT39|That translates into inflation.
NEUT40|"In the United States and I think the Federal Reserve at some point is going to have to defend their dual mandate."""
