NEUT0|"""But if the Fed embarks on this, they keep on their current path."
NEUT1|They will roll the economy over.
NEUT2|As Steve said, nothing is inevitable.
NEUT3|I'm hopeful of economists say cautiously, optimistic.
BEAR4|I hate that phrase.
NEUT5|But it's appropriate here that the Fed will not over hike.
NEUT6|Inflation is extraordinarily low.
BULL7|The benefits of the tax cut have yet to be fully felt on the business side.
NEUT8|So I'm hopeful the Fed won't move that much more.
BEAR9|But it's a big effort if they keep going, you're going to get weaker growth in the back half of 19 and recession risk goes up.
NEUT10|Significantly for 2020.
NEUT11|Mark, how do you see the path of economic growth going into this last quarter and into next year?
BEAR12|I think growth is definitely slowed.
BEAR13|I think lot of people are on pins and needles for what happens with the Fed.
NEUT14|Obviously going to the end of the year and the China concerns I think are real and that.
BEAR15|Combination of those things has made the market very fearful.
NEUT16|I think one will probably dictate the other, and I think the president is hopefully paying attention to what's going on with the economy.
BEAR17|And if we do see those slight signs of slowing and the outlook starting to diminish, I think we're probably going to have to talk about what that affected China is.
NEUT18|And I haven't really seen the effects of the slowdown in the tariffs into the economy, and that becomes more pronounced.
BEAR19|I'm much more fearful of a downgrade in terms of growth for 2019 and through 2020.
BEAR20|Joe clearly getting some downgrades the last week or two for US growth.
NEUT21|What's your view for 2019 internationally?
NEUT22|And what are the key sort of swing factors or bearish factors you think one or two people might be missing?
NEUT23|China is a big concern.
NEUT24|I mean, they're trying to deleverage their economy, and it's possible.
BEAR25|Along the way they hit some pitfalls you've seen really weak.
BEAR26|You seen significant weakness in there and fixed investment.
NEUT27|They're trying to move away from the over investment in housing.
BEAR28|You're seeing money supply growth slowed, so China certainly poses a risk.
BULL29|However, will for the good news is with China slowing the global output gap should open commodity price.
NEUT30|You should stay weak and that should allow the Fed to back off of the brakes and let the economy run hot.
NEUT31|So what might be a negative?
NEUT32|Could be a positive if the Fed runs the economy.
NEUT33|I'm not particularly worried about the tariffs, not that they're not a big deal, but the Fed is always the proverbial straw that stirs the drink.
NEUT34|The mark is The upshot of all this, that Trumponomics was just a sugar high that led to adult in growth off the back of tax cuts and confidence and deregulation.
BEAR35|And it's not going to last much and it's just going to put the Fed in a more difficult position.
NEUT36|Well, I think the story hasn't been written yet.
NEUT37|I think we're going to see.
NEUT38|I mean, we're already seeing parts of that.
BEAR39|I think the housing sector is clearly slowed.
BULL40|You have people with adjustable mortgages who were the first time I really seeing a big increase in terms of some of the payments they have.
NEUT41|People haven't opened their fourth quarter statements obviously.
NEUT42|Yet that will be January of next year and we really haven't seen the flow through from the corporate America to the employee.
NEUT43|We've seen it for the corporate balance sheet, so it might be that sugar.
NEUT44|How you're describing and there's lots of tools that we've had.
BEAR45|"There's not a lot that we have left, and that's a little bit worried something to me and I think the combination of that and people doing their state and local taxes where they're going to see that those are going to offer some of the big growth states the big coastal states just worries me more about 2019 than some people are paying attention to."""
