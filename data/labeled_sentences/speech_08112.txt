NEUT0|"""What do you think is the real future of ESPN?"
NEUT1|Yeah, the Bob Iger today.
NEUT2|Kind of, you know, continued to outline some of the future initiatives for ESPN.
NEUT3|The key issue is to take ESPN direct to consumers.
NEUT4|Much like consumers can get Netflix directly over the Internet, they don't need to subscribe to a big pay TV package that is currently the distribution model for ESPN and other cable networks today.
NEUT5|So all cable networks, including ESPN, really need to think about can they go direct to consumers over the Internet.
NEUT6|And will consumers pay for this content and how much will they pay?
NEUT7|So just last quarter several weeks ago when they released their earnings, Disney did announce that they're going to bring an ESPN app to the marketplace next year.
NEUT8|We don't know what it's going to be priced at.
NEUT9|We don't know what content is really going to be on there.
NEUT10|We didn't get much more news today, so investors feel like this is a move that Disney has to make.
NEUT11|The question is, are they kind of too little, too late?
NEUT12|At this point there's been great fascination around the succession plan at Disney.
NEUT13|Of course, Bob Eiger.
NEUT14|Decided to resign for a few more years but after that you know what do we know about who comes next?
NEUT15|That's a problem we don't know a lot at all because I don't think the Walt Disney Company nor its Board of Directors knows a lot right now.
NEUT16|At least.
NEUT17|They haven't disclosed anything to the marketplace.
BEAR18|We know that Bob Eiger has two years left on his contract.
NEUT19|You know, he's kind of extended that a couple of times.
BEAR20|The very well thought out succession plan that this company had over the last seven or eight years did not workout really at the last moment, which was a real problem for the company.
NEUT21|So the left kind of figuring out what's Plan B here.
NEUT22|Do they have any internal candidates?
NEUT23|None appear to be really at the top of the list, so that suggests they may go outside of the company.
NEUT24|And of course you could argue that the Walt Disney Company is arguably the best CEO job out there, and there should be a lot of interest in it.
NEUT25|"The question is, can they get the right person to lead this company into a technical, more technical world?"""
