BEAR0|"""Thanks for watching this very quick video on Chevron Corporation and there is not a lot to say about this talk, so this stock has been performing since May is going down on this set back trend and the prices have been moving inside this channel between 50 U.S. dollars and 100 U.S. dollars."
NEUT1|So we can say about this talk.
NEUT2|It's not really a lot and this is mainly based on technical analysis and the best option.
NEUT3|To the coronavirus that's still with us and still increasing his power around the world.
BULL4|With Europe going in lockdown for the next month, and perhaps US has to do something because they've already registered higher cases last.
BEAR5|I think yesterday with more than 100,000 infected people in a day, so the idea is just too old for this stock.
NEUT6|But if you want to risk based on technical analysis, what we can say is that if this support level.
NEUT7|65 U.S. dollar would not be broken idea.
BULL8|Maybe to go longer by or otherwise if this support level will be broken in the next 2-3 days.
NEUT9|Idea is to go short, we need to see where the close price of let's say next week or this talk.
BEAR10|If the close price will be below 65 U.S. dollar for at least two or three days in a row radius to my big to go short.
NEUT11|Otherwise, if it's if it's caught up in the opposite at next 20 days in next actually week.
NEUT12|And for at least two or three days in a row, the close price will be able.
BEAR13|This support level Daddy's to go long, even if it's too risky right now to invest in these in these companies, because you know, there might be another global lock down in the US as well.
NEUT14|I don't know bout in the Europe is coming.
BEAR15|We got Italy, it's gonna go in lockdown soon.
NEUT16|We got German, Belgium and France and now England.
NEUT17|So I think we're gonna go we're going to.
NEUT18|Go back again as it up in the most 6-8 months ago.
NEUT19|This is my interpretation for this stock.
NEUT20|"Thanks bye."""
