NEUT0|"""Facebook when Facebook went public over here on the opening Bell and this was back during the week of May and they priced it high."
BULL1|It was up here at $45.00.
NEUT2|We told everyone to stay out of Facebook.
NEUT3|Our price target.
NEUT4|We have the live videos.
NEUT5|I gave a much lower target.
NEUT6|I told people do not buy it before the fact on the day that this thing went public and I did it because I cared about the people of that.
NEUT7|Everyone wanted to own Facebook but.
BEAR8|You know it was grossly overpriced.
BULL9|As an IPO and all the big players bought it and they held it all the way down and even when they see this video, they're going to kick themselves in the *** because once again, stock market funding had it so right.
NEUT10|And all of your people on your television networks in your stock programs and your big institutional buyers.
NEUT11|They had it all wrong and there was no reason to buy it.
NEUT12|And I, you know, when this thing was trading up here and I talked about it coming down to 1750 and it would have its weekly ranges were at 52 week lows at 1755.
BEAR13|And I'm still telling people, even though that I took the targets down around $15.
NEUT14|What I did say though, that.
NEUT15|Facebook.
BEAR16|May have to get close to single digit values, that's a 50% lower value than from here below $10.
NEUT17|Before it's a great buy, that's another $7.00.
NEUT18|Let it be known that stock market funding had this right and the reason why we had it right and everyone else had it so wrong is because we know what your rational exuberance does without earnings.
NEUT19|There was no earnings yet that we can quantify, and we still don't know what the earnings are going to be.
NEUT20|But at some point in time.
BULL21|We have been waiting patiently and once again the short side of Facebook is paying.
NEUT22|Lots of people are buried.
BEAR23|They lost $50 billion in market cap.
NEUT24|We warned people about it.
NEUT25|I've got no more to say 52.
BEAR26|Week lows on Facebook.
NEUT27|Will there be a time to buy Facebook?
NEUT28|Absolutely, but now is not the time and I don't know how I can quantify the earnings.
NEUT29|Moving forward until possibly getting down to around all, let's say $9.70 by 1080.
BEAR30|That means that it would have to lose.
BEAR31|Another huge dollar in market cap.
NEUT32|Going down to single digits.
NEUT33|So Facebook stock market funding we try to do our best for you because we care about you and even the biggest institutional community is paying the price.
NEUT34|They're paying the price.
NEUT35|"There's going to be a time where Facebook can be bought, but that isn't the time right now."""
