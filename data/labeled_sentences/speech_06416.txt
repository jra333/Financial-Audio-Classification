BULL0|"""You, there's a stock market predictor that has accurately foretold the markets direction for the past seven years in a row, and overall has an 82% completion rate."
NEUT1|What if we also told you this predictor hinges on the outcome of an athletic event here with the story of the Super Bowl stock predictor?
NEUT2|Is WSJ News editor William Power Bill Great to see you?
NEUT3|So we're on a roll.
NEUT4|Another reason to watch the Super Bowl?
NEUT5|Tell us how this works exactly well.
NEUT6|This indicator the way it works is if an original NFL team.
NEUT7|When's the Super Bowl the market goes up for that year?
BEAR8|If an old AFL team like the New England Patriots wins, the market goes down and it works four out of five times since the Super Bowl started.
NEUT9|It's amazing, but totally unscientific.
NEUT10|So give us some examples of some of the teams in each category.
NEUT11|The bullish and bearish, but the biggest is the Patriots, their bearish.
NEUT12|And when they won last year we had a very clever headline Senate saying that they would deflate the stock market, which they did.
NEUT13|They did not use that one again.
NEUT14|So that's the way it works and for seven straight years it's worked.
NEUT15|Then no one well we can.
NEUT16|There's ways of explaining it.
BULL17|It's basically a fun indicator, but you're right, it's been remarkably accurate.
NEUT18|Are there any other indicators that can predict the stock market to such a degree, not four out of five times, or 82%?
NEUT19|There's an old joke that recessions are predicted nine out of five times.
NEUT20|So who do we have to thank for discovering this predictor?
NEUT21|And who sort of carries the torch as it were, there was a.
NEUT22|There was a New York Times sportswriter Leonard Carpet that put it in a column, but I think he was just sort of making a joke and.
NEUT23|Distance himself from it.
NEUT24|There's a market analyst named Bob Stovall who has filed it for decades as a sidelight, and he's about to turn 90, which makes him 40 years older than the Super Bowl itself.
NEUT25|So he's followed it and his son is pretty famous Sam Stovall from SMP and yet even he admits there is absolutely no scientific basis to this.
NEUT26|But yet it has been studied by academics.
NEUT27|Are there any theories out there?
NEUT28|There's a couple of reasons it works.
NEUT29|One is at the Pittsburgh Steelers count as an original NFL team because they were even though they're in the AFC now and save 1/6 times in the market.
NEUT30|Went up all six times, right?
BULL31|That helps.
BULL32|Also, the market tends to go up, and original NFL teams tend to win.
NEUT33|Could there be anything psychological to that, even subconscious, on the idea that the old schools that are more traditional teams make the country feel better somehow?
NEUT34|Anything that happens at that?
NEUT35|Predicts the market will go up isn't bad, right?
NEUT36|And some people have said, maybe it's it's a reversal is starting to affect itself the other way around, right?
NEUT37|So all of 2015, it was hanging out there that the market was supposed to go down and actually at the very end, if you remember, the Dow almost had it up here, but it had it down here.
NEUT38|Well, maybe the Patriots something tells me you may be an Eagles fan.
NEUT39|I don't know.
NEUT40|I thought I'd wear that to get the abuse and you guys have never won the Super Bowl.
NEUT41|Yes, never say never but they want a championship in 1960 and.
NEUT42|That was a great decade for stock, so I'll throw that in there.
BULL43|Very good bill power.
BULL44|"Thank you so much for that."""
