NEUT1|Friends in this video we are going to discuss about a sinus tech SENESTCH.
NEUT2|Now if you're looking at this current price structure, what you can see here that.
NEUT3|Price has been moving in between a range, but what we're expecting here looking at this current price action is a breakout, and that's what we're going to discuss, which is about a probable breakout.
NEUT4|Obviously, on the outside.
NEUT5|Now what you're going to see is a range that is in between 1.4 on the downside, so don't try to go below or don't try to keep your position or below 1.4 and the first target that we're going to look at it.
NEUT6|3.43 or 3.5 now 3.43 or 3.5 will be your.
BEAR7|Big resistance because it's been trading inside the range for the last, I think 10 months or a year.
NEUT8|Now if there isn't a breakout.
NEUT9|Above 3.5 in that case you are specifically looking at two targets on the outside, so the first target.
NEUT10|Will lead us to $11.00.
NEUT11|And as you can see, this deal, and this is the 200 daily moving average, so it can also be possible if the stock sustained above $11.00.
NEUT12|But that's not our focus right now.
NEUT13|What we're focusing here for the time being is the range.
NEUT14|As I told you, which has a resistance of 3.43 point 5, an once it's sustained about 3.5.
BULL15|The big jump will take the price towards $11.00.
NEUT16|And let's say if it indeed surpassed $11.00 as well, there is a probability of $19.00 also in the upcoming week as well as in the upcoming month.
NEUT17|So this is the end of the video.
