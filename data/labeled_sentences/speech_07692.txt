NEUT0|"""Who who do you consider the most important philanthropist?"
NEUT1|Well, I I think that there's a good chance when the record is written that building Melinda will turn out Gates will turn out to.
NEUT2|Set the record in that and they, but they've got the most resources too and they started young and they've got a common passion.
NEUT3|It's always fun to have a partner.
BULL4|It's made a difference in running Berkshire, and I think it makes a difference in any activity.
NEUT5|It's just more fun to have a really able partner shares your enthusiasm, shares the defeats when you have him, and so on, and.
BULL6|Anvils has more resources at his command and he's going to be even contributing.
NEUT7|Additionally, I mean, he puts significant money in this year trying to keep over the use.
NEUT8|No, he he'll, he'll, he'll end up putting more money and then I will.
NEUT9|But I mean he's going.
NEUT10|He works at it.
NEUT11|Really all his waking hours I'm not so sure he doesn't dream a little bit about it too, but he is.
NEUT12|He has that he has an intensity about anything he takes on and he he took this on her at an early age and he had a partner in Melinda who's who's got no brains that she's got terrific instincts and she she's very good at handling people.
NEUT13|Every time I see her.
NEUT14|You know, if she's been to Africa, I mean when she holds a baby.
NEUT15|She cares about that baby, you know.
NEUT16|I mean, when I if I hold the baby, I'm wondering if you're going to pee on me or something.
NEUT17|All for the kid having a wonderful life, but I just did somebody else help him, you know?
NEUT18|So you've got this, you know they've got, they've got the opportunity still young, but I've got that and something like polio that that really takes an intensity of commitment and billions of dollars, and he's willing to take on things that were not sure of success.
NEUT19|That's what I really like.
NEUT20|I don't want either building Melinda or my children who are involved in some fairly major philanthropic efforts.
NEUT21|I don't want to take an easy stuff that's funny.
NEUT22|People take on the easy stuff, and I want him to fail reasonable percentage of the time.
NEUT23|We're all know that they're just.
NEUT24|Just swinging at the bad pitches?
NEUT25|"Well, it's like business, and if you're not failing, you're not trying, yeah."""
