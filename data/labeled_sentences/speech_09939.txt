BULL0|"""So the Feds two day meeting getting underway today and while no policy changes are expected, the outlook for rate hikes is starting to shift."
NEUT1|And for that, Steve Liesman has the results of the latest CNBC Fed survey, Steve.
NEUT2|Good morning Andrew.
NEUT3|You have the CNBC Fed survey shows the market's speed up, the timeline for Fed tightening, potentially putting the Fed and the markets at odds over the policy.
NEUT4|Outlook respondents now see the Fed hiking rates for the first time in November 2022 and ending QE or asset purchases in November 2021.
NEUT5|That's later this year, 63% of the 43 respondents say the $120 billion of monthly purchases are not needed either for the economy or in the markets, and 83% say.
BEAR6|The 1.9 trillion Biden relief package was too big.
NEUT7|Back in September, respondents forecast the first hike February 2023.
NEUT8|Now it's November 2022.
NEUT9|So that's about three or four months later, better vaccine and economic news that played a part, obviously.
BULL10|But the huge amount of fiscal relief has also been a big factor.
BEAR11|Robert Brusca, chief economist, at fact and Opinion, Economics, writes the stimulus package is too big and poorly allocated.
NEUT12|Much of the money will not get into a productive spending stream to create stimulus, but you'll narrow off of narrow, economic says.
NEUT13|2.7 trillion.
BULL14|That's the last one, and this one here in stimulus in one year, should lead to a booming economy even though inflation and interest rates may rise, they're only getting back to more normal levels faster than expected.
BULL15|And that is good for the economy.
NEUT16|So 2 views there.
BULL17|Well, back in December, the ten year was forecast to rise modestly this year to 1 1/4%.
BULL18|It's already surpassed that at 160 and headed to 2% this year and two point 4% next year, according to respondents.
BULL19|And the two point 4% level.
NEUT20|That's also the average response for what would take what it would take to bring the Fed into the market.
NEUT21|So little expectation at this point that the current yield the Fed would ride to the rescue of bondholders enter.
NEUT22|Who?
NEUT23|It's going to be fascinating to see what's going to happen.
NEUT24|You know who we have in the next hour, do you?
NEUT25|Well, you got Jack Lew coming up and Judy Shelton I think is that who you're referring to?
NEUT26|That's who I'm referring to.
NEUT27|I want to know what you want to know.
NEUT28|Well, I mean, I read Miss Shelton's last piece in the Journal, and I think she's very much against all of the things the Fed has done, and I think you could make an argument somewhere along the line that maybe what they're doing now is too much, but you know, was all of it too much?
NEUT29|I guess is the question you might, you might ask him.
NEUT30|Also interested in this idea of maybe Jack would talk about this.
BEAR31|Other central banks have expressed their concern with higher bond yields, but.
NEUT32|This Federal Reserve has not, so I'm interested.
NEUT33|Does he think the Fed needs to come in at some point or be prepared to come in at some point?
NEUT34|And of course enter the question is this?
NEUT35|Fed had a forecast an it was perhaps not based on.
NEUT36|First of all, the blue wave coming and then the extra 1.9 trillion of stimulus.
NEUT37|And why that does or doesn't change the feds own policy outlook.
NEUT38|If you look at the forecast for the dot plots and do, they don't really have rate hikes until 2023 markets moving that forward.
NEUT39|Not that significant that the Fed and the markets are out of wack for the next couple of years, but would be interesting to see how they would realign again.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
