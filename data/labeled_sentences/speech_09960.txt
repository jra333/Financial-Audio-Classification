BEAR6|So this talk all week with trading around 2 to $3.00 and decided to jump to $5 one back down to around $3.92 and jumped all the way up to $7.34.
BULL7|OK, so in this talk I think they have the potential to reach 10 to $15.
BEAR8|I'm going to empty stock, and while I think that is because I think so.
NEUT9|All the same pattern and did so here the pattern list that it went up OK like how we just did right now and went up, went down skyrocket again.
NEUT10|It's probably going to happen again and go to 10 to $15.
NEUT11|That's just my prediction.
NEUT12|And.
BULL13|If you look at the chart, we can see that the volume jumped really really high to almost 300,000,000 an yeah, so we got a lot of attention and they start to skyrocket.
NEUT14|So before the average line was around like 5 to 10 million somewhere on that.
BULL15|And yeah, I'm pretty bullish on the stock.
NEUT16|It's pretty good stock, and if you guys have any questions about this, doctor is coming down below.
