NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|Today will be looking at USD JPY on the daily chart, so zooming in and we can see that the yen has sunk aggressively following the latest slide that commenced on March 24th.
BEAR2|Pulling past all simple moving averages and under the 107.69 hurdle that being a 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the upper leg from a 41 month low of 101 point 17211.71 currently upside correction seem limited by the Mid Bollinger Band and the flat and congested Smas of.
BEAR3|Back in a stalled negative phase or the short term oscillators, which suggest a poor state of directional momentum.
BEAR4|If sellers resurface and steer below the 106.91 an 106.75 immediate Lowe's, they may need to challenge the 50% fibo of 16.44 underneath to confirm a continued plunge.
BULL5|Pushing past the 106.44 barrier.
BEAR6|The 61.8% fibo of 105.20 just above 105.13 important rough could prove tough to drop below.
NEUT7|If the Bears aim to head towards the 104.50 support and the lower Bollinger band around the 76.4% fibo of 103.66, Alternatively, initially restricting upside moves order 38.2% fibo of 107.69 and the Mid Bollinger Band following those is a crowded area of obstacles from the 200 days in May of 108.32 until the 23.6% fable of 109.22, which involves a 50 and 100 day Smas as well as the nearby swing high of 108.72.
NEUT8|Overtaking this resistance trench.
BEAR9|That price may rally back to the 110.75 mark which, if broken, could see a test of the 111.71 pecan fold summarizing the near term temporary pause in the market would require a clear break either above one and eight point 72 or below 106.75 in order to reveal the next directional move.
NEUT10|That's it for me.
BULL11|"Have a great trading day."""
