NEUT0|"""Alright hello everyone, stop Master back here with another video for you all."
BEAR1|I know that I have not uploaded video for awhile and many of you might be thinking that oh he's not uploading because the market is bad.
NEUT2|That is partially true.
NEUT3|I have said it in my previous videos before and I'll say it again.
NEUT4|I am not a pump and dump reviewer.
NEUT5|I do my DD and I try to get everyone the correct information.
BEAR6|The past two weeks have been crazy with the red pump happening again and now with the government bond issue.
BULL7|Therefore I took my time doing research and I am back.
NEUT8|So before we start.

NEUT10|If you enjoy the content today topic is a itx.
NEUT11|Aits is an AI company that focus on operational security and monitoring needs.
NEUT12|Is a penny stock and they have done some DD on it to believe that it has LA potential in years to come.
NEUT13|If there are positive countless then this stock girl of course do your own DD.
NEUT14|I'm not a financial advisor so invest at your own risk.
NEUT15|Let's get to it.
NEUT16|That print price of AI TX.
NEUT17|Is .096, then the market cap is 245 million.
BULL18|The thing I found surprising for this penny stock is that this company has been generating positive revenue the last few years.
BULL19|This means that they're getting contracts with companies already.
BULL20|They're growing and have a lot of potential.
BULL21|Of course there have been positive news coming out about a itx of Fortune 10.
NEUT22|Company is actually buying.
NEUT23|Their product is good for the company, but many of you might be wondering why this stock is not moving much at all.
BULL24|Even with this news.
NEUT25|Here's the thing.
NEUT26|Last stocks are releasing good news and nothing is happening.
NEUT27|I personally believe this because of the current market situation.
BEAR28|Alot of investors have pulled out their money and they're focusing on retail stocks because of the red pumps.
BEAR29|At the same time, the government bomb situation isn't helping anything.
NEUT30|Therefore good news like this will be overlooked until the market is back to normal, but once the market is back to more right, it will bounce back.
NEUT31|Aits could potentially grow with news like this, so if you look at the chart on the right, these are the current top ten companies also known as Fortune 10.
NEUT32|One of these companies will buy a ITX product.
NEUT33|It doesn't matter which company investing attacks when the news is released, this stock will benefit from it.
BULL34|Another reason why I believe that Aits will have a lot of potential for long term.
NEUT35|Hope they market that this company is in is expected grow 45.2 billion by 2026.
BULL36|That is exponential growth and early investors would benefit from there.
NEUT37|Another thing to mention is that AI TX is 1.
NEUT38|The first company in this area.
NEUT39|Do you DD and see if Aits is the right fit for you?
NEUT40|Alright, so let's get to the market crash or market correction right?
NEUT41|That everyone has been talking about.
BEAR42|My personal opinion is that this is a market correction with this like crash or cash movement.
NEUT43|Like I mentioned already, the red pumps and federal issue is happening right now.
NEUT44|My market correction perspective is that I had mentioned in my videos before that a lot of stocks are overvalued right now that eventually true valuation will prevail.
BEAR45|And that's happening a lot of stocks that were sitting in the high hundreds or crashing back down to the low 30s or the high 50s are back to the 10s and 20s.
NEUT46|That's a correction of course.
BEAR47|I believe that this correction or some may call it a crash going to be short lived when the new stimulus check comes out.
NEUT48|Which is going to happen regardless.
NEUT49|Whether it's this month or a few months from now.
BULL50|This next check is coming for sure, and that will boost the market.
NEUT51|At the same time, once the Fed finalized their decision on the bonds and bank situation, everyone will start investing again.
NEUT52|If you have been the stock market for awhile, then you know that fear plays a big role.
BEAR53|Alot of money are being pulled out.
BEAR54|'cause of fear both the stock market have always rebound from a correction or crash in the past.
NEUT55|If you want proof look at my stock market crash video.
BULL56|Therefore, personally I'm not too worried and I had invested more in stocks.
BEAR57|They are dirt cheap right now.
BULL58|Alright, so if you made it this far, just know that I appreciate it.
