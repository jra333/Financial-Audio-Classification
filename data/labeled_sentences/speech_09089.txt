NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link when absolutely fantastic move on Apple today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume and well above average volume on the day I'm going to go ahead and just get rid of that line down there.
NEUT4|It served its purpose for now, but to offer a little context of what happened today.
NEUT5|And this will mean a little bit more of those you have watched the past videos.
NEUT6|I've done an Apple but for quite awhile now we've been tracking that dotted red line up there, which was that overall area of resistance.
NEUT7|And the big dynamic that happened today is we now have, in training jargon, a trendline break out.
BULL8|The price got up.
BULL9|There has now broken through that red line and up.
BULL10|It's going so well.
BULL11|Very solid tactical event today by breaking above what had been a very stubborn, annoying area resistance.
NEUT12|So I'm going to get rid of that now.
NEUT13|Just 'cause I don't have no clutter and confusion all over the place, 'cause there's lines everywhere, but just keep in mind that is the general context of things.
NEUT14|So now moving forward where some of these levels of support and resistance resistance at first level of support is right here at one 1950.
NEUT15|And that's what I would call the ideal of.
NEUT16|We never asked, you know, Clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT17|Definitely, if the price could say above 119 fifty.
NEUT18|But I mean if the price drops below there, that doesn't mean the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price could say above there that would be a great sign of power looking at things for more.
NEUT19|So the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT20|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|Simple moving average as the name implies, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, so when it comes to just gauging the health of the overall movement.
NEUT23|That right there would be defined as the movement.
NEUT24|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT25|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT26|His visualize that.
NEUT27|That is what is being represented.
NEUT28|Insurance and above 119 fifty would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT29|Let's squeeze down the chart here in next key big battleground to watch moving forward.
NEUT30|Now going to be right up here at the 121 mark.
NEUT31|If you go back through the history of things you can see 121.
BULL32|Was a problem and once again a problem right there, so not saying the price can't break above it, but that's certainly going to be a big battleground to watch moving forward, but All in all very very nice way to start off the new week.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you.
NEUT43|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live.
