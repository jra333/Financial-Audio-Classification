NEUT0|"""Facebook guys I told you."
BULL1|Lower high.
BULL2|Equal high on the tools.
NEUT3|The trend is up, but look what's going on.
NEUT4|Well, about to recross up on the zero line here look this Mac.
NEUT5|This train is dying to recross up here, leading into FOMC lot strain to recross up on.
NEUT6|Facebook I caught up with fantastic Facebook with the community last week and the app and I don't like to do any day trading.
NEUT7|Usually I like to do the day trading in the lecture room which we start at 9:00 AM today.
NEUT8|Otherwise we start at 8:30 everyday but when you do the app.
NEUT9|What I do on the app is I do just swing trading and long term investing and if you look at our.
NEUT10|Traded on Facebook last week.
BULL11|We did a quick 271 to 76.
NEUT12|Probably can see now two 71276 Oh yeah, you got little from last week on the app and that was a 5 hour day trade so usually I don't put their trading in the app but that was five hours.
NEUT13|I figured you have five hour to get in five hours to get out, you know?
NEUT14|So I'm looking at the opera blue that on Facebook now an I'm wondering guys.
NEUT15|If Facebook is going to hold here and break this 276 and go to a new high 295, so essentially I'm feeling that.
NEUT16|Facebook is trying to break that down trend line flag.
NEUT17|It's not very pretty.
NEUT18|Well I've done, but you get the gesture.
NEUT19|So Facebook as a very important ranch.
NEUT20|It's a 257.
NEUT21|Look, let me give you everything 240.
NEUT22|257 on Facebook right?
NEUT23|And the 267.
BEAR24|I feel if we break the 267 on Facebook everybody we will go to the 290 and possibly a new high on Facebook.
NEUT25|Alright, so watch very important this 267.
NEUT26|276 and these 285 on Facebook.
NEUT27|Those are the three top number I'm looking 76285 to 90 on the bottom you have two 67257 since we are above the 267 which is the top of the box.
NEUT28|It's bullish with this cross of the Mag dies on Facebook going into the FOMC meeting tomorrow.
NEUT29|"So on pullback watch that 267 if it holds not yeah."""
