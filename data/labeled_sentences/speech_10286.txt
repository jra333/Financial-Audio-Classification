BEAR0|"""Like Tesla, the electric specs have become battleground."
NEUT1|Stocks are mentioned in there tough.
BULL2|As an investor, I've gotten easier way.
NEUT3|So let's consider the so called internal combustion engine Dinosaur starting with forward now.
NEUT4|First of all, Full disclosure.
NEUT5|I like Ford stock so much that it's a huge position of our travel trust and you can follow that by joining the action alerts plus.com Club, where we've had this wrestle with the idea of the stock being up too much.
NEUT6|Why is this?
NEUT7|First, 'cause the company's got some exciting new products hitting the market, including the fully electric Mustang?
NEUT8|Maki SUV and the new hard to get Ford Bronco.
NEUT9|Second, I think we're about to see a small business renaissance as the economy reopens, and when small businesses expand, you know what they buy?
NEUT10|I'll tell you what they buy.
NEUT11|They buy pickup trucks.
NEUT12|And what's the best selling pickup truck of forever and blah blah blah blah?
NEUT13|Yes the F-150.
NEUT14|I mean, I got a 350 but the one 50s cool enough.
NEUT15|By the way, there's an electric version coming down next year and everybody wants that third last year for blood in the Sky, CEO Jim Farley.
NEUT16|He's taking a new radical approach.
NEUT17|I'm Adam.
NEUT18|OK, but he actually.
BEAR19|I mean I know this is gonna shock people who've known for it for a long time.
NEUT20|He actually cares about making money.
NEUT21|Alright, may not sound that impressive, but the old Ford didn't really work like that.
NEUT22|They had all these far flung international operations of dubious profitability, but they do.
NEUT23|But if they made any money at all, but the company kept them running because that, well, they wanted to make cars all over the world, I mean, thanks to Farley, that's now now over.
NEUT24|He wants to make money and if he doesn't make money, he doesn't want to be in the market.
NEUT25|That's what I've been waiting for for decades.
NEUT26|Alright?
NEUT27|Have a General Motors now.
NEUT28|They're really going all in electric vehicles here.
NEUT29|They have plans for 30 electric vehicles on the market.
NEUT30|In a few years, nobody else comes close, except maybe Volkswagen, their tracker.
NEUT31|There's a lot less impressive.
NEUT32|On top of that, GM's port, a massive amount of money into coming up with better battery technology for electric cars.
BEAR33|Batteries have big bottleneck here, so that's a huge differentiator.
NEUT34|Listen, some people think the battery business is worth the whole price of the company.
BULL35|Finally, I think CEO Mary Barra deserves a ton of credit for turning this thing around when it comes to EV.
NEUT36|She's the real deal.
NEUT37|And those of you who doubt that you will be wrong.
BEAR38|Very wrong, I know.
BEAR39|We've heard a lot about some doctor shortage has made it hard for these companies make money and that is true.
BEAR40|The lack of chips is limiting their production.
BEAR41|That's a real negative, but at this point I'm just did not know that.
BULL42|Plus, even though Ford and GM have had huge runs, their stocks are far from expensive.
NEUT43|They're both selling for about 9 times.
NEUT44|Next year's earnings estimates.
NEUT45|Even after this run, they are the cheapest 2 stocks I follow in the entire stock market.
BEAR46|That's wrong.
NEUT47|Don't miss a second of mad money.
