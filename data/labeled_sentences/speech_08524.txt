NEUT0|"""Hello everyone kept him here and in this video I want to talk about Verizon's acquisition of a key rival of Zoom and what this means for zoom stock going forward."
NEUT1|Also, if you like 3 free stocks, went for Weibling Robin Hood, check the links in the description below.
NEUT2|So getting into the analysis, Verizon just bought Zoom competitor Blue Jeans for under $500 million.
BULL3|Now this is significant because blue jeans has really high end customers such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Goldman Sachs, so this is very important.
NEUT4|Looking into the utilization of blue jeans because this might be an even more corporate.
BULL5|Environment and better service when Verizon integrates their systems into blue jeans.
NEUT6|Now they also said Verizon wants to use blue jeans for 5G integration for Tele medicine and stuff like that.
BULL7|So that's also very good news for Verizon and Blue Jeans.
BEAR8|But bad news for zoom.
NEUT9|So overall.
BEAR10|Zoom also today had a very awful report come out that a lot of Zoom's profiles are being sold on the black web, so that's also awful because.
BEAR11|Many people are getting their information stolen and hacked, so this is going to create a bad environment for zoom and in general their platform.
NEUT12|So overall, Verizon, right now Cisco and Microsoft.
NEUT13|They're all Verizon, Cisco and Microsoft.
NEUT14|They're all key competitors for Zoom, and Verizon just joined.
NEUT15|So overall zoom stock in my opinion, is not a goodbye right now is not in general good because what is zoom really offer?
NEUT16|I mean, sure, it offers the interface to collab with many other people, but I feel like this isn't a new idea and the reason that we only show this growth was because from 10 million subscribers to 200,000,000 subscribers for June is due to the pandemic.
NEUT17|So overall, I think if we when we go back to.
NEUT18|Normality, I mean, I don't think zoom is a very impressive long term stock.
NEUT19|I don't think it does anything special that hasn't been done before.
NEUT20|We've also had Skype before, right?
NEUT21|I mean, it's a similar.
NEUT22|It's a similar thing.
NEUT23|It's not a crazy concept, and it's not a revolutionary concept in my opinion.
BEAR24|So the fact that it's trading extremely high and has kept on holding its gains is mind boggling to me because I don't know why this is such a big deal.
NEUT25|You know, the stuff that zoom offers when you have other bigger companies coming in, buying different platforms and.
NEUT26|Trying to integrate them for their business model.
BEAR27|So overall I think zoom stock's bearish guys.
NEUT28|Be careful when investing your money.
NEUT29|I think zoom over here.
BEAR30|Big going into the technicals is overextended.
BEAR31|We're kind of meeting previous resistance over here, so I think we're going to see a pullback in zoom stock if you're trading in Jim stock.
NEUT32|So let's get into Verizon just to see it out of curiosity now.
BULL33|Verizon Communications is also pretty much bounced over here, but we're meeting the 200 simple and exponential moving averages over here, so I think this is also kind of a topping out level for Verizon, and I think we're going to further pullback if you guys are looking to get into Verizon.
NEUT34|So overall guys stay safe when training out there.
NEUT35|These are risky environment, I think zoom is not anything special and you guys should take that into consideration.

BULL38|"Have a great one."""
