NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol PLUG."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Now I'm well aware there's been a whole lot of drama that's taking place after hours today with the news released.
NEUT5|So as of right now, as of the recording of this video, the price is sitting there for PLU G right there around.
NEUT6|Let's just call it $38.50.
NEUT7|Now the tricky part here is we still have all of after hours today on Tuesday.
NEUT8|Then we have all of premarket on Wednesday.
NEUT9|So where are where is this thing going to actually open up?
BULL10|Not quite sure, but as of now it seems like it is going to open up quite a bit down below.
NEUT11|Then you know where the price closed today at the 42 ish 70 mark.
NEUT12|So like I said, I'm going to assume that it opens up right down around.
NEUT13|You know, the $38.00 mark give or take and the first level of support that's looking like it's going to come into play here is going to be right there at $37.50 so 3750 you can see back to the history of things was a very nice job and did a good job of providing support.
NEUT14|So that's one of those areas where like set the price does open up right around the 38th.
NEUT15|That could very well be a level of support that comes into play.
NEUT16|Pretty quickly, so that would be that first level that you would want to watch if 3750 is broken and does not quite hold up, then the next level of support you would want to watch very closely right down there at the $35 mark.
NEUT17|So 3750.
NEUT18|Thirty five two main areas of support as far as levels of resistance.
NEUT19|So if the price you know tries to bounce back upwards.
NEUT20|First, the area resistance going to keep an eye on right down there at $39.50 and then after 3950 next key level after that would be right up there around $41.50.
NEUT21|So again, now if the price of a sentence I want to open back up, you know around the 42 ish 43 dollar level.
NEUT22|Well then these levels kind of are irrelevant.
NEUT23|At that point, Blank said doing my best to try to figure out where the price might open up.
BEAR24|So it opens up down around that 38 ish dollar mark.
NEUT25|Then these are going to be the definitely the key technical levels to watch moving forward.
NEUT26|So looking like Wednesday is going to be very very crazy day.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
