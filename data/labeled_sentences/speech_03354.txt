BULL0|"""Good evening traders around the world."
NEUT1|It is 6:29 PM on February the 4th, 2016.
BULL2|Hope your February is off to a great start.
NEUT3|Let me just shoot over to Netflix now I just want to kind of dissect this trade for you.
NEUT4|O what you're looking at here in the date that I'm backed all the way up to.
NEUT5|Around the 7th of December?
NEUT6|OK, that's what this this candle is right here this December 7th.
BULL7|And at this point in time, the blue line was above the black line, which as you know that means the trend is expected to go up.
BEAR8|However, at this point in time, the neural index had dropped down to a zero, saying the trend was going to go down.
NEUT9|Anybody who was not in a trade.
BEAR10|This would not be a good time to get in, but you should be watching because the fact that the neural indexes dropped into a zero, the fact that the blue and the black line are starting to converge tells you that there may be a trend change.
NEUT11|About to occur, so I'm just going to advance this day by day and you'll see the blue and the black line converged so much so that they finally crossed.
NEUT12|Now this was your first indication of a real trend change and I'm just going to keep advancing this day by day.
BEAR13|And as you can see, it's going down.
BEAR14|It's going down now.
NEUT15|It starts going up a little bit and you can see the neural index pops up to one.
BEAR16|This is telling you that there may be some strength, but the overall trend is expected to still be down, and that is why the blue line has remained below the black line.
BEAR17|Lot of traders probably were not sure what to do at this point in time.
BEAR18|Some may have gotten out.
NEUT19|Some may have stayed in and you can see went down and down and down and down and down and as of right now the software has been forecasting.
BULL20|It's going all the way through today.
BEAR21|It's still been forecasted to go down.
BEAR22|All in all, if you calculate from the beginning of this downtrend that was forecasted by vantage point through today over the last 38 trading days, the stock has gone down almost 30% / 36 dollars.
NEUT23|"Per share, so again, whether you shorted the stock or you were using options as a vehicle to take advantage of this downtrend, lots of money to be made."""
