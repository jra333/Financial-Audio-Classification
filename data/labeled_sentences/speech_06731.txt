NEUT0|"""Hey, how's it going?"
NEUT1|Everyone it's Nick.
NEUT2|Hear from trader line.
NEUT3|Wanted to make a short video in high tide flags.
NEUT4|They're not common at all, but when you do stumble across one, you definitely want to know what you're looking at, how to trade it, and understand why they form in order to take advantage of the opportunity.
NEUT5|Because these are very, very powerful patterns, they're very easy to understand, so it's going to be a very short video, but it is a very powerful pattern.
NEUT6|So the characteristics of a high tight flag, 100% or more of a move over 48 weeks.
NEUT7|So this thing in a few weeks makes a very very long move.
NEUT8|And the reason it's called high Tide Flag is because that move is what resembles a flagpole.
NEUT9|So after you have that massive move it correct sideways less than 25% in a very short period of time, usually about three weeks, and say three to five weeks, and you normally get another 100% or more move from this.
NEUT10|This is why we really want to make that video, because this is a powerful pattern.
NEUT11|I cannot say it enough.
NEUT12|But it is very, very rare.
NEUT13|I have an example right here from how to make money in stocks.
NEUT14|This is back in 1999 and you could see that from right here you get a run up from about 44 to 90 and then it stops and it pulls back very little and very quickly three weeks.
NEUT15|And then you buy it through that resistance again and it ran to nearly 200.
NEUT16|So what exactly is going on in this pattern will?
NEUT17|You have institutions basically buying hand over fist.
BEAR18|They want this stock and they want their stock bad.
BULL19|They're buying hand over fist over a few weeks, and that's doubling the stock price.
NEUT20|Now normally if you have 100% move that quickly, you're going to see a lot of profit taking, but with the high tide flag pattern you have three weeks where it's barely any profit taking.
NEUT21|It holds up the gains relatively well, and then it's off to more buying, so this three weeks right here.
BULL22|This high tight flag is showing you that despite this massive moves from institutions buying hand over fist.
NEUT23|They still don't want to give up their shares.
NEUT24|They don't want to sell, they just had a huge return.
NEUT25|Nobody wants to sell.
BEAR26|That's extremely bullish for the stock, and so it takes off yet again.
NEUT27|Now here's an example I pulled up from stock charts, and if you want you can pause this video and try to find the high tight flag before you do that, though, let me just point out that this stock is adjusted.
NEUT28|This is from 1999.
NEUT29|Why are these charts from 1999?
NEUT30|Because this is very, very rare pattern.
NEUT31|It's rare, but when it does come up, you want to know about it.
NEUT32|So it's a rare pattern.
NEUT33|I don't know of.
NEUT34|Any current high tight flag setups, or else I would use a more present one.
NEUT35|And of course there there's been high tight flag since 99, but they are few and far between, so this would be the resistance on your high tight flag.
NEUT36|This 37.5 area and this is your flagpole now it's showing here that we broke from about 20 to 37.5, which is not 100% move but back in 1999 this high type flag broke out from 100 and doubled to about 203 to 4 weeks.
NEUT37|So you've got your flagpole right here again.
NEUT38|Remember, this is adjusted for sports.
NEUT39|This is back in 1999, so you have a massive run in the stock.
NEUT40|Nobody wants to sell.
NEUT41|You could even see it making higher lows and then it breaks out again and it goes for a huge move.
NEUT42|So that's it for the high typhoid guys.
NEUT43|Very simple concept.
NEUT44|100% move over 48 weeks, barely corrects showing you that despite the massive move nobody wants to get rid of their shares and so when it's ready to break out it normally moves for another 100% minimum.
NEUT45|So keep your eyes peeled for high tight flag if you find any.
NEUT46|I don't feel like setups don't be shy about sharing with me, but hopefully now when the next one comes you will be prepared for it.
BULL47|So this video is helpful.
NEUT48|If anyone has any questions.
NEUT49|As always, please don't hesitate to ask us.
NEUT50|"If not, have a great rest of your day and I'll talk to everybody soon."""
