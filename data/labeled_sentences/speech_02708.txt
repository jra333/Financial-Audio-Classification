NEUT0|"""How do you link your economic view at Pantheon into our belief in corporate earnings?"
NEUT1|The mystery that's out there of how corporations will do.
BEAR2|Yeah, I'm kind of worried about corporate earnings.
NEUT3|I think this is a sort of perfect storm.
NEUT4|It's coming with the slower growth through a storm.
NEUT5|It's not talking.
BEAR6|2008 was less to restore meant for Newcastle United.
BEAR7|This weekend was a full blown hurricane remote Hurricane Hurricane.
NEUT8|Lester Richard is a full blown hurricane.
BEAR9|Yes, so the storm at slow growth is a top line squeeze on corporates.
BULL10|Plus pickup in wage growth not going crazy, but certainly picking up and there's a squeeze on margins.
BULL11|Plus of course tariff pressure, which requires some margin compression A plus.
NEUT12|I also think the Fed isn't going to be as easy as markets think, so there's maybe a valuation risk for stocks as well, so you put it all together.
BULL13|You've got a much less favorable earnings environment of course, coming off of 2018, when S&P earnings were up more than 20%, that was never going to happen this year, because of course last year was boosted by the tax cuts.
NEUT14|But the slow down, I think is looking to me more or less endless.
NEUT15|I don't really see.
BEAR16|A recovery in earnings in the foreseeable future and coupled with the uncertainty from the trade war that strikes me, is kind of pretty toxic.
NEUT17|Even so, just to you know, take a step back.
NEUT18|What are you actually expecting the Fed to do?
NEUT19|An insurance card in December?
NEUT20|Or you think that that even that is overblown?
NEUT21|I think even that's a bit overblown.
NEUT22|I'm not saying that they can't do it, although it's out of the question, but I would say at this point it's maybe a 3040% probability that the issue really is that a low growth is weakening.
BEAR23|It isn't rolling over at this point I hope, and I'm also concerned that I think that the inflation pass through that will see from the consumer goods tariffs is likely to be bigger than the Fed expects, is right now.
NEUT24|Their inflation forecast shows.
NEUT25|No change between the end of this year and the end of next year.
BEAR26|Even though we've got these consumer goods tariffs that haven't even begun to work through yet, so I think there may be underestimating it inflation risk, and the growth numbers won't be absolutely terrible, so maybe they should hold fire for a little bit longer.
BEAR27|"I don't think the case is very compelling, and clearly their committee is completely split down the middle internally as well."""
