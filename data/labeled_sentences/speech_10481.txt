BULL0|"""Jim FedEx and Adobe to kick around from last night."
NEUT1|Wow, I mean these were congratulations gentlemen and ladies calls because the numbers were so unbelievably good.
BULL2|Much better than people expected.
NEUT3|Now this is rather amazing car.
NEUT4|Why?
BULL5|Because there are firms that upgraded and pushed and raised numbers for weeks and yet they were dramatically exceeded.
NEUT6|FedEx, because of AECOM.
NEUT7|96% of the growth there is AECOM and Adobe because it's how companies are able to digitize quickly deadly retailers.
NEUT8|In order to be able to take advantage.
NEUT9|Of this amazing wave, this amazing boom of e-commerce to the home.
BEAR10|Because of the pandemic.
NEUT11|So how can there be such a structural, thematically strong story behind E Commerce and packages and growth and the targets that FDX has pulled forward by years and all the good news today on vaccines and therapeutics?
NEUT12|Well, I think what's really convincing here.
BEAR13|One FedEx is that they're talking about how there's actually a weak economy and the service economy, and that is weak.
NEUT14|And they say, it really doesn't matter.
NEUT15|We've got this new material economy at home.
BEAR16|So I mean when I look at the retail sales they seem weaker, but I think FedEx and Adobe are at the heart of Ika man.
NEUT17|I don't think that those numbers pick up E. Com.
NEUT18|I do think that when we speak to Meg, I hope she's talking about the possibility David.
NEUT19|This has always been a focus of yours, about the therapeutics.
NEUT20|"I didn't hear anything today from Lily or Regenerx on in my own reporting that made me feel that gave that those are on the horizon or that they'll get shell the hospital quickly."""
