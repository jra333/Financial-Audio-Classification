NEUT0|"""What is that last candle?"
NEUT1|Yeah, that word maybe and possibly.
BEAR2|Good good so you guys can see that there is some sort of rejection coming into the uptrend, but it didn't turn it around.
NEUT3|Now, how does this candle look on a lower time frame?
NEUT4|Just just imagine that if this was a daily chart and then I split this up into like a four hour chart.
NEUT5|What does it look like?
NEUT6|The opening price was where?
NEUT7|Here, so here's the candle going upwards.
NEUT8|OK then the candle goes up again.
NEUT9|That high then the candle goes up again.
NEUT10|Maybe like that gets rejected at this height?
NEUT11|Then the candle comes down.
NEUT12|And red, sorry I should make this in red.
NEUT13|OK, and then he comes down again.
BEAR14|Oh, sorry, that's too much.
NEUT15|OK, and then you come down a little bit more and that's where he stops.
NEUT16|Isn't that what it looks like?
NEUT17|Here is the opening price.
NEUT18|Here's the closing price, so this is the opening how it looks on a lower time frame.
NEUT19|And here's the closing part.
NEUT20|How it looks on a lower timeframe.
NEUT21|Notice how it's not.
NEUT22|It's not disrespecting something like an SNR or anything.
NEUT23|It's just like this.
NEUT24|It looks like that.
NEUT25|"OK."""
