BEAR0|"""Hey guys, what's up?"
BULL1|Welcome back to effortlessly invest this week.
NEUT2|I'm going to be covering documentary and education streaming platform, Curiosity, stream ticker symbol, CURI.
BULL3|It's currently my largest holding about 9% of My Portfolio and I believe it's got huge potential to Dublin.
NEUT4|More over the next year or two.
NEUT5|Please please, please don't take this video as investing advice as I'm not a professional.
NEUT6|I've just done quite a bit of due diligence and I wanted to share it with you.
NEUT7|Right, so let's jump into it.
NEUT8|Probably the best place to start is by pointing out our program.
BULL9|Viewership is changing around the world.
NEUT10|More and more people are adopting streaming services such as Netflix and cutting back on the traditional method of tuning its programs like satellite or cable TV.
NEUT11|A prime example of this would be this year's Super Bowl game.
BULL12|Streaming views are up 65% from last years, and it was the first NFL game to ever stream over 1 billion minutes.
BEAR13|Cable TV subscribers have been declining since 2006, and it's a worrying trend for the industry which is likely to continue well into the future.
BULL14|New subscription service platforms are becoming more and more popular and growth is accelerated even more during the pandemic.
NEUT15|We've now got Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney Plus, and a bunch more, but Curiosity Stream offers something a bit different.
NEUT16|It isn't trying to compete directly with the likes of the big name streamers, but just offers something different instead.
NEUT17|Its content is for educational, factual documentaries and IT dwarfs the libraries of Netflix, its industry leader.
NEUT18|In this kind of content, which isn't surprising considering its founder is also the founder of the Discovery Channel.
BULL19|Now, as far as I'm aware, there aren't any direct competitors to Curiosity stream and this will allow it to maintain subscribers year after year due to it being the market leader in factual content.
NEUT20|It also opens up a potential revenue stream with schools, universities, colleges, that kind of thing, and that's often overlooked by the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime.
NEUT21|They offer universities and organisations the option to buy subscriptions in bulk under a discount.
NEUT22|These subscriptions can then be handed out to students or employees, allowing them to use the content as a method of remote learning, offer case studies and whether we like it or not.
BEAR23|Remote learning and working has been forced opponents this year and curiosity stream.
BULL24|They've benefited and probably will continue to benefit in the future.
NEUT25|If it proves successful, universities are likely to become a recurring revenue stream from.
BULL26|So we know they've got the potential for recurring revenue streams in the future, but how they performed lately?
BULL27|Well, in the latest quarter results revenue increase from 4.8 million to 8.7 million.
BEAR28|That's an 83% year over year increase and the amount they lost was lower too.
BEAR29|They've gone from being at a loss of around 10 million in 2019 to 6.7 million in 2020, so you can see the losses are coming down, which is eventually going to lead to profitability.
BULL30|On top of that, they've increased their subscriber count by 108% in one year.
NEUT31|That's a massive amount of growth.
BULL32|They've literally more than doubled the subscribers in one year.
BULL33|The growth estimate from actually look pretty positive.
BULL34|2-3 expecting revenue of 71 million or 80% growth year over year.
BULL35|If they do achieve this growth, then it's likely that we could be looking at profitability within two or three years, which would be awesome.
BEAR36|Is the deal breaker for middle as early as last week there was insider buying.
BULL37|Now Insider buying is a great indicator that companies expected to perform well.
NEUT38|The inside is another company better than anyone else.
NEUT39|And if they thought the company was going to perform bad, did either not buy anymore shares or simply sell their own shares, you can see here that John Hendricks, the founder and chairman of Curiosity Stream.
NEUT40|But $1,000,000 worth of shares just a week ago.
BULL41|To me this is a super bullish signal that things must be going well for the business.
BULL42|In summary, the projected growth of this company mixed in with insider buying makes it a safe long term investment for me and wanna plan on holding for a good couple of years and predicting that its share price will double this year alone.
NEUT43|As long as quietly results meet expectations throughout the year.
NEUT44|"Hopefully you found this video useful and it's helped you to have a bit of an understanding of curiosity stream if you have any questions about the company, please leave them in the comment section below and don't forget to like and subscribe peace."""
