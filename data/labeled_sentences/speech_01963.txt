BULL0|"""We also have four xmedia chairman Steve Forbes on that China Angle here and growing optimism that a deal might be imminent."
NEUT1|We've we've heard that one before, but what do you think?
NEUT2|Yes, we have heard it before, but I think the key thing on these negotiations.
NEUT3|Neil.
BULL4|In addition to China promising to buy more stuff from us, is access to the Chinese market, not just promise of access, but in the past when they've allowed access.
NEUT5|Then they've hobbled are companies with regulations and capital requirements in the like.
NEUT6|So what the Chinese have to come up with, and I think they will.
NEUT7|Is that this time?
NEUT8|If you're allowed in China, you're not going to be hobbled unnecessarily or unfairly.
NEUT9|It's been the case in the past.
NEUT10|That is the key.
NEUT11|That's the key negotiating item.
NEUT12|Then how do you do the Ronald Reagan thing trust, but verify.
NEUT13|How do you monitor that to make sure they're delivering the goods because they've hoodwinked Republican and Democratic presidents alike over these many decades?
NEUT14|How do we know that they'll stick to whatever they are on the verge of announcing?
NEUT15|Because this time we're taking it seriously.
NEUT16|In the past we did not do the kind of a surveys.
NEUT17|And following through on information about unfair practices, and I hope this time two we enlist the Europeans and others who trade in China who also have these problems.
NEUT18|So if you take the thing seriously and bring enforcement actions when you see something not being done right, bringing him to court or the WTO or Trade Organization, or putting on sanctions on those particular individuals and companies, that would be very different from what we've done in the past.
NEUT19|In the past we set, please behave yourself and then we didn't follow through on enforcement, but a lot of times we did appeal to the.
NEUT20|As you said, the World Trade Organization an I know during the Obama years and even in some cases in the Bush years we won there quite often now.
NEUT21|What happened?
NEUT22|Did they not follow up on the rulings that were made against them, the Chinese, or what?
BULL23|Well, we did win 85% of the cases we brought before the World Trade Organization, so it's a good mechanism for us.
BEAR24|But again, the cases were sporadic.
NEUT25|There was nothing systematic about it, and so you'd bring a case you'd win it, but you wouldn't bring other cases that you should have been bringing an the WTO enforcement in this high Tech Age may need to be updated back in the 1990s.
NEUT26|We had a previous a trade.
NEUT27|Organization it needed to be updated and that's how we got the WTO.
NEUT28|We may need an update today in the digital Age of enforcement so China can't play the game of starting these shell companies.
NEUT29|You know you hit one company and then five others come up elsewhere.
BEAR30|So if you had, I'm sorry.
BEAR31|If you had to monitor China right now, the bigger worry seems to be not so much the little score trade deal with them, but whether China's weakening to the degree that it won't be worth much on paper because they won't be able to deliver the goods or buy more of our goods because they're falling into something maybe as bad as a recession.
NEUT32|What do you think?
BEAR33|Well, their suffering their equivalent of a recession right now, and I think, and I think that's going to put pressure on President G to go back to the kind of free market reforms that China did engage in in the 1990s and early 2000s.
BULL34|And then backtracked on, especially after the 2008 financial crisis.
NEUT35|So I think China is going to make some internal changes, not because they're suddenly reading Adam Smith, but because they realize that they don't deliver the goods.
BEAR36|That's going to undermine the political legitimacy of the regime, and they know what that means in China.
NEUT37|All right, Steve was the pleasure.
BULL38|Thank you very much my friend.
NEUT39|Thank you.
BULL40|"Yeah you too, thank you."""
