BULL0|"""Hello Friends, welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video."
NEUT1|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about Onconova 3 updates.
NEUT2|Now.
BEAR3|I've talked about this stock couple of times and the stock has more very sharply in the past and with two or three weeks of correction it has already started moving up and people got scared off that what will happen now.
BEAR4|Everything is going down so if you don't understand the trend and if you cannot accept that there will be a correction and consolidation on the way probably.
NEUT5|This will happen, but now things have turned and.
NEUT6|We will.
BULL7|We are on the upside so the entire market has started moving again on the upside.
NEUT8|So having said that.
NEUT9|The way the stock is started moving what you need to look at are the primary range, or is the primary range inside which the stock is currently trading right?
NEUT10|No.
NEUT11|What we have on the downside is your support or the stop loss at .83.
NEUT12|On the upside, you have two consecutive target.
NEUT13|First will be at 1.59 and your second target will be at two point.
NEUT14|07 OK, in the new you need not to look at the entire range.
NEUT15|The price trend is fine, but what is not being adjusted is the price itself.
NEUT16|OK, so maybe there are some issue in the price, but there is no problem with the train Dan.
NEUT17|Anyhow, we're not going to talk about $55,000 or 100 and $75,000 socially.
NEUT18|Not to worry about those now.
NEUT19|If you're looking at the trend now.
NEUT20|If, as I told you if it does not go below .83 and if it crossed these two target level first 1.59 and 2.07 or 2.1 then we're looking at a target which is as high as 7.77.
NEUT21|Now what is aventurine?
NEUT22|Certain .77 this is a 200 and moving average or we can call it as a.
BULL23|Golden moving average 'cause if the stock continues to hold above this 200A moving average, it is actually giving a positive signal.
NEUT24|That's why because it is trading below 200 day moving average.
NEUT25|That's why it's going to works as work as a resistance for the time being.
NEUT26|And we will re analyze the chart accordingly.
NEUT27|But yes.
NEUT28|The correction has probably ended, and we're definitely going to see some firecrackers in the stock market going forward, so this is the end of the video.
