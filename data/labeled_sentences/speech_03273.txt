NEUT0|"""Hey guys, it's something you guys real quick on the Funko play that I that I did that EA on a little bit earlier."
NEUT1|I did tell you guys that we were on the road to going back to 646.
NEUT2|We are currently on the road to going back.
NEUT3|I would be perfectly comfortable shorting Funko at these prices all the way up to 646.
NEUT4|Unfortunately you know I don't do shorts.
NEUT5|I would only buy a put on phone call right now but I'm waiting to buy in.
NEUT6|I'm not waiting to actually, you know short this stock.
NEUT7|I will happily be swing trading Funko and I will be buying in at 646 if it drops back down lower to 596 I am going to be purchasing some more.
BULL8|I do think that $6 or the 596 level is going to be the floor and we're going to keep rising up.
BULL9|You know, we're still extremely bullish right now for Funko on the day chart and also on the four hour chart.
BEAR10|The MCD is currently about to close, it's it's going to turn slightly bearish for phone call.
NEUT11|Right now I do not think that we're actually going to, you know, keep going down.
NEUT12|Especially right now.
BEAR13|I mean even even on the weekly look on the weekly, we're still Super Super, Super bullish.
NEUT14|There's no reason why we can't.
NEUT15|We're not going to keep going all the way up to $8.00.
BEAR16|I do think we're going to drop back down to that six.
NEUT17|What is it called?
NEUT18|When did I say the six?
NEUT19|That 646 level I am going to be purchasing about 80% of my swing position there and then.
NEUT20|If we drop back down to 596 I will be purchasing my other 20% of my position.
NEUT21|I will be holding and more than likely I will be having my cell limit at $8.00 an which which and then from what from $6 to $8.00.
BULL22|That's like a 30% gain.
NEUT23|I think I am going to be buying about $6000 worth of Funko.
NEUT24|30% of that is going to be.
NEUT25|1800 bucks so I'm looking to actually get $1800 profit from Funko.
NEUT26|I don't think I'm going to be holding Funko after the $8.00.
BULL27|I do think that it has potential to go all the way back up to 25.
BULL28|To its previous highs, there are rumors that Funko is actually going to be partnering with Disney.
NEUT29|I would absolutely believe that 100%.
BULL30|And you know, I, I would definitely believe that Disney is going to be, you know, perfectly happy with with Uncle, maybe possibly doing like purchasing them all out.
NEUT31|On the MCD for the actual for the month chart it looks like.
BULL32|We're still bearish, but I do think the upside to Funcle is absolutely incredible, and I do think that we have a huge potential to go back to the top range of 28 bucks.
NEUT33|So yeah, I will be starting.
NEUT34|I do as of right now.
NEUT35|We did retest as you guys can see.
BEAR36|We did re test a scandal at $7.10 we retested and I do think we're going to go back all the way down.
NEUT37|Will be starting.
NEUT38|I will be buying my position.
NEUT39|I will start buying at 646 and if we drop down to 596 all buy more.
NEUT40|But yeah this is my Tia.
NEUT41|"This is basically what I'm going to do from an extreme trade and I'll see you guys next time."""
