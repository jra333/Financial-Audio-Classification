BEAR0|"""Ann, it's time for our last tick of the day, Goldman Sachs, The Wall Street Journal reporting the Banks partnership is shrinking as it looks to restore its exclusivity."
BEAR1|At least a dozen Goldman partners are reportedly negotiating their exits.
NEUT2|Yahoo Finance's Heidi Chung.
NEUT3|And As for A and Dan Hally are back with me to wait in.
BULL4|Heidi up to 15% of Goldman's partners may at least Lee looking to this year the high turnover so far.
NEUT5|That's at least according to what the Journal says.
NEUT6|What do you make of the moves?
NEUT7|Yeah, so at least according to the Journal, it seems that the current CEO David Solomon is all about bringing Goldman Sachs back to its glory days.
NEUT8|All about that exclusivity.
NEUT9|Goldman Sachs was really the leader in Wall Street and was really highly respected.
BULL10|So I don't know if this will actually make Goldman Sachs another leader again in the space.
BULL11|But we'll see if this will bring back its exclusivity.
BULL12|And as we've got 69 new partners at Goldman this year, there is a smallest amount in 20 years.
NEUT13|How much of this is really about exclusivity?
NEUT14|How much is it?
NEUT15|A cost cutting measure?
BULL16|"Well, certainly the Wall Street Journal had also noted that Solomon, and perhaps believe that the partnership was getting a little bloated and they may be also clearing some space for leaders from their new consumer businesses as well, Akiko."""
