NEUT0|"""You've used the word crisis and credit crisis right now, certainly not 2008."
BULL1|The banks far better capitalized, not taking the risk anywhere near like they did more than 10 years ago.
NEUT2|Where's the crisis going to be?
NEUT3|Well, I I've been saying all along to the next financial crisis is not going to be like 08.
NEUT4|That was household mortgages and leverage banks, but it's going to be corporate debt and shadow banks because the problem the United States is the buildup of corporate debt.
NEUT5|Leveraged loans Cielo's $1 trillion of fallen Angels in high grade.
BEAR6|They're going to be downgraded to below.
BEAR7|Investment grade and they have their whole situation in the Highland junkware covenants and all the standards and the spreads have been too low.
NEUT8|That's what depression is going to be.
NEUT9|And by the way, if you compare it to my January and February of 16, when all went to 30 at that time, yet contagion to the high yield you had spreads going from 300 to 900 'cause it started in energy sector, and then it spread given the losses across the high yield.
BEAR10|Right now have shut down market in leveraged loans in Cielo's in high grade in even high yield.
NEUT11|And you're not going to have any.
NEUT12|Essentially unfreezing of this market.
NEUT13|So and in addition to energy, you have all the other sectors like airlines and cruise ships and entertainment that are highly leveraged.
BEAR14|There are also going to be under stress.
BEAR15|Therefore if in 16 you had the leverage is leading to spreads going from 3 to 9 and right they can go much higher this time around and the continuing to be more severe unless you do something and that's going to be probably trick to bail out the cruise ships, the airlines and all sorts of other financial institutions.
NEUT16|If you do that, maybe you can stop the credit crisis.
BEAR17|Otherwise gonna credit crisis.
NEUT18|You live even to bail out.
NEUT19|Maybe some of the energy sector.
NEUT20|I don't think that's politically feasible.
NEUT21|It should be clear you think it can happen that quickly, because by all means, most people in terms of the longevity of this particular shock think that it will be temporary.
NEUT22|Now, I agree that if you get the right tools in place, you can stop that from coming.
NEUT23|A temporary shock transpiring materializing into a much deeper financial situation that you're talking about.
BEAR24|If we're talking about a two month, three month here, that kind of shocked the US economy.
NEUT25|Do you really think he can do that kind of damage?
NEUT26|Well, you know.
BEAR27|First of all, we're going to have a global recession.
NEUT28|And it's not just my view anymore.
NEUT29|If you look at PIMCO JPMorgan even a perma optic is like a diamond, always saying will be a rolling recession in the first half of this year in Q1 is because of China, Italy, Japan and Korea in Q2 is going to be US and Europe.
NEUT30|The question mark then is only first half of the year, or spills over into Q3 in the US and Europe.
NEUT31|And the answer that question is a three quarter to quarter recession depends one on the policy response.
NEUT32|If it's not aggressive on the fiscal, is going to be aggressive on the monitor.
BEAR33|It could be a Q3 problem.
NEUT34|And Secondly, whether we contain the spread.
NEUT35|In China, than the most draconian thing in three months, they stopped it.
NEUT36|If you look at what the Italy has happened, if they what's happened here is going to happen in Europe and United States is going to be at least six months to contain it and therefore have a recession.
NEUT37|Also in the third quarter.
NEUT38|Then things get really much more ugly.
BEAR39|Also for the financial system you can survive with illiquidity, withheld for three months for six months if it's nine months, many people are going to bankrupt households.
NEUT40|Corporates ** ES, and even some of the big highly leveraged players in energy in airlines and song.
NEUT41|Of course the airlines are going to build out because.
NEUT42|"That national security, so we're not going to bust."""
