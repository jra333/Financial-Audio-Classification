NEUT0|"""Steve off one of the people there just mentioned social utility."
NEUT1|What is the social utility of free commissions if they're really not free commissions and there's a hideaway hidden away about flow of trades.
NEUT2|Well, I think they're referencing Tom just getting retail more involved again in the market, which generally is a healthy thing.
NEUT3|It's price discovery and I think having retail investors in the market, something we've really lossed since.
NEUT4|The Great Depression and back in 0809.
NEUT5|So I think it's generally healthy thing.
NEUT6|I you probably saw my piece called Bubble Bubble, toil, and trouble I you know I, I would you think we got a couple of bubbles going on here but not not the overall market.
NEUT7|I mean you know the total market is trading on our numbers at around 18 * 2022 earnings, so abroad.
NEUT8|And that's against a bond backdrop that's 100 half then I were not in a bubble yet and bubbles don't burst anyway until the Fed gets involved.
NEUT9|And you know there we think there are ways off if we start Steve off with the idea that it's not 2000 is not March of I believe it was 2001.
NEUT10|I can't remember right now, but if we say that we're not bubblicious is we were back then.
BULL11|Nevertheless, we have a generation of IPOs.
NEUT12|This packs the direct issues in such.
NEUT13|Are we fooling ourselves?
NEUT14|That yeah, it's different than 2000, but not that much different.
NEUT15|That is another kind of bubble that's forming right now.
NEUT16|The way the negative bubble you know stocks with a negative story.
NEUT17|And then yeah, the.
NEUT18|The other side of that, like fear and greed on the same side of the trade, basically with GameStop, right?
NEUT19|That's what's going on.
NEUT20|What you just alluded to is what I call the good story bubble.
NEUT21|And, you know, growth investors spend a lot of time trying to go through good stories and find the ones that they think can forward compound at very attractive rates, and maybe create the next Apple or or Amazon.
BEAR22|Uh, the problem it going on now is more and more of these stories are coming to the market before they're really ready, and it itself is becoming a very speculative game.
NEUT23|And what's happening is a lot of people are jumping in simply because not that they've done the work on that particular story, but because they like the story and the stocks going up or it's going to go up.
BEAR24|That's dangerous.
NEUT25|You get a lot of people involved in a name without a real concrete reason why they're in it other than they think someone else is going to buy it higher.
NEUT26|And that's a dangerous game to play.
NEUT27|So frankly, Tom on this backside we are involved there, you know, but we've done, you know, a handful of them.
NEUT28|Out of the dozens that are come to the market at this point, I'm not even sure it's probably over 100.
NEUT29|There's some.
NEUT30|I think there's going to be some good, some good stocks there eventually.
NEUT31|You know they come out of it once they IPO, but it's it's not for the faint of heart.
NEUT32|And the idea that you're just going to get money, make money jumping in there is not a good idea.
NEUT33|"In my mind."""
