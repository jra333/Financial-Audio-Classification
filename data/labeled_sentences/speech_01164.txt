NEUT0|"""And Joe, what do you think?"
NEUT1|Let's just run through some of these earnings news that we just got coming out.
BULL2|Companies like 3M little better than expected, but saying that it's really hard to see how long this pandemic is going to last and what that's going to mean for the results down the road.
BULL3|Yeah, listen 3M needed that they need the improvement in the transportation and electronics division more than anything else.
BULL4|It's good that they return to organic growth as you know they suspended the buyback program so the return of that capital allocation strategy is going to be important.
NEUT5|Looking forward Becky, I'm not sure if I'm ready to suggest stepping into 3M right now.
BEAR6|I think there are multiple headwinds still ahead of it.
NEUT7|About Caterpillar, I mean that's a similar global company that's interested, waiting for a rebound, right?
NEUT8|Well, that's that's the interesting one.
BULL9|There's been a strong outperformance Full disclosure.
NEUT10|I own Caterpillar.
BULL11|It's been outperforming relative to its peers and it's really doing that on the belief that there will be some form of a wave, whether it's blue or red, and therefore you going to get some infrastructure spending.
BEAR12|But I do think you're you're at the point where dealer inventories are reaching the traf.
NEUT13|They've done an excellent job in terms of destocking, and it really now it's about the ability for there to be.
BULL14|A sustained economic global revival.
BEAR15|If we get that inventory levels are at a lower enough pace where I think that you will see 2020 be a rebound year for Caterpillar.
NEUT16|So that's the one I'm excited about.
NEUT17|Becky.
BULL18|We were challenging towards an all time high within the last couple of days were falling back a little bit, but for me, Caterpillar over 3M offers more of a compelling investment opportunity.
NEUT19|You're excited about it, but the markets not.
BEAR20|This morning that stocks down almost 2%.
NEUT21|Even though the company beat both on the bottom expectations, things going on.
BULL22|I think the expectations were high and you know that's been the case.
BEAR23|Listen, it's been very difficult.
BEAR24|Well, the expectations were very high, but it's been very difficult for companies in this quarter to have price performance that equates with earnings beats very challenging.
NEUT25|Most of the companies that are reporting their reporting strong quarters, but we're not seeing the strength and reaction for the share price, so I don't know if that suggests to investors that maybe there's a full or or fairly valuation.
NEUT26|For a lot of these stocks, but there's a very high bar to exceed, and I think that was in place for Caterpillar, but I want to look through that.
NEUT27|I want to have more of a long term focus and understand that they're navigating a secular shift here.
NEUT28|With that, I think is finding its trophon the moment, and that's where the investment opportunities for me.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
