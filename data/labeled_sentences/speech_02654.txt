BULL0|"""Fed pauses, markets rally."
BEAR1|The Federal Reserve has shelved its plans for a string of rate increases in 2019.
BULL2|Both equity and bond markets rally on the confirmation that no rate rises were insight for 2019.
NEUT3|While some might argue that the Fed felt the political pressure from the White House to suspend interest rate increases, we would argue that the driving force in the change in policy guidance.
NEUT4|Was the wake up call given in the fourth quarter of 2018 by the sharp decline in equity prices?
NEUT5|But there is more to this story.
BEAR6|In late 2018, equity market participants became much more bearish as they assess the outlook for 2019, interest rates have been rising for several years, and the Fed was guiding that more hikes were on the way.
BEAR7|This meant the economy was headed for an inverted yield curve.
BULL8|Short rates higher than long term yields an inverted yield curve is an excellent predictor of future recessions down the road.
BEAR9|Then there was the deepening concern over the US China Trade, Trade War and clear signs of global growth, already slowing both interest rate hikes and the trade war impact the economy with long and variable lags.
NEUT10|So 2019 is the critical year the Fed was caught in its own trap of being data dependent.
NEUT11|Data is inherently backward looking like driving a car by looking only in the rearview mirror.
NEUT12|Not recommended.
BULL13|Markets are forward looking while the backward looking economic data looks good.
NEUT14|What the Q 420 eighteen equity slide told the Fed was to wake up, look ahead and take the risks of an inverted yield curve and the trade war much more seriously.
NEUT15|And at least this time around, the Fed listened to the markets changed course and hopefully just in time.
