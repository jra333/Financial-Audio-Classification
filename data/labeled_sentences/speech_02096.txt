BULL0|"""Hello, thank you for watching."
NEUT1|It.
BULL2|Looks like Coca Cola is having a good day after quite a bad week.
BULL3|It looks like it could probably head back up to 52.
NEUT4|Which doesn't surprise me 'cause at the moment GameStop looks like it's going to crash, which?
NEUT5|Which we all expected.
NEUT6|Nothing rises that fast.
BULL7|I'm pretty confident on Coca Cola.
NEUT8|As you can see I've got Â£184 in it.
NEUT9|Plus a fireplace pays dividends of three point 4%.
NEUT10|So.
NEUT11|I mean no rush.
BULL12|"So even if it does get back up to 52, I think Coca Cola is more of a long term stock anyway."""
