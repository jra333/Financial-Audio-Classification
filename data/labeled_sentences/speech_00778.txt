BULL0|"""I got an interesting play here."
NEUT1|It's a stock that hasn't been in play.
BEAR2|It's been beaten down over the last six months because of what's going on in the economy, but what we're seeing right now is positioning for a big payoff within 15 days or less.
NEUT3|So let's take a look here before we do.
NEUT4|My name is Joshua Bellinger and this is another episode of follow the money.
BEAR5|We're taking a look here at Spirit Airlines, and this is SAVE, and as I said, this has been beaten down and has not seen much activity since that big pop back in May.
NEUT6|Which is about the bailout, more stimulus, and since then it's been on pause here.
BEAR7|One of the other weaker sectors with this as well, because the travel has been oil, so we haven't really seen this participate in the overall market.
NEUT8|But what we're seeing is possible positioning here, so when you look at something from June to November, we look at that and we say, especially this tight range.
NEUT9|We've seen a lot of tight range in back and forth here, and you can make a case for that.
NEUT10|Buyers.
NEUT11|All the sellers are getting out and buyers are starting to position the thing that's coming into focus right now is that we're talking about a second wave.
NEUT12|Now.
NEUT13|This has already been priced into the marketplace.
NEUT14|What we're probably looking forward, or the markets looking forward to is more stimulus.
BEAR15|And now with not knowing who is taking the White House at this moment.
NEUT16|Either way, it's going to benefit the airlines and what we're seeing here is travel.
NEUT17|Hold back because of more restrictions come into play and so forth.
NEUT18|But market as I said, is already priced.
NEUT19|That in it makes it for an interesting play.
NEUT20|It's you would refer to this as a dog, and at times dogs start to get a little bit of momentum here, so probably a pop higher.
NEUT21|Let's take a look here at the option activity that we're talking about, or what I'm going to show you here in November.
NEUT22|Contract that expires 15 days from now we saw about 13,000 contracts trade against an open interest of 9000.
NEUT23|Now majority of those were.
NEUT24|Aimbot, and they're buying it at the 20 strike here, so prices at $18.00 they're looking for a pop higher to $20 now that right now the Delta on this is about 30, so there's a 70% chance that these expire in the next 15 days.
NEUT25|Worthless, So what they're looking for is that quick pop higher.
NEUT26|So one of the interesting ways to trade this would be to buy yourself a little bit of time.
NEUT27|So this is known as a calendar.
NEUT28|What I would be looking to do here is possibly sell that twenty strike and then by that December 20 strike.
NEUT29|Here you do that for $0.70.
NEUT30|So instead of paying $0.55 for that option in November and that has 15 days, we could still have some upside.
NEUT31|And still buy some time.
NEUT32|Being long December.
NEUT33|In short, the November so the decay on this one.
NEUT34|You're just looking for the decay to kick up and then December, even if it does go higher that December is going to likely offset that short November contract, so this is a more strategic way of playing it, but this is a smart way of playing it.
NEUT35|I pay a little bit more, get a little bit more time, you have 43 days, and if it does pop pops in your favor at $0.70 it turns into maybe a dollar, maybe $1.10, and that's a good.
BULL36|Set up good risk, reward looking for a pop higher in a sector that's been toxic for the last six months.
NEUT37|"I'll talk to you next episode."""
