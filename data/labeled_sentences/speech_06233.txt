NEUT0|"""It's claimed to be a video chart on ticker symbol am, ZN, Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Did this analysis previously, so that is where the red and green line annotations were coming from, but after today's price movement, definitely.
NEUT4|Some updates here need to be made.
NEUT5|First thing to do is a little house cleaning here.
NEUT6|Going to get rid of both these lines.
NEUT7|Sure they still pertain, but they're not really relevant right now.
NEUT8|And from a presentation standpoint I don't want this causing confusion.
BULL9|Puzzle replaced, so let's just get those out of the way and will start a fresh air because you know, today's price movement was very, very solid.
NEUT10|Newest level of support and what I would call the ideal area.
NEUT11|Say what makes this chart look the absolute strongest?
NEUT12|Going forward.
NEUT13|That would be if the price could say up here above 3160.
NEUT14|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3160.
BULL15|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could somehow managed to actually step above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT16|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT17|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT18|The 50.
NEUT19|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT20|Which is very beneficial because when it comes to just gauging the health and measuring the health of the overall move that right there I'm defining as the move.
NEUT21|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT22|I can visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what is being presented against and about 3160 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowl is 100% owned.
NEUT24|The chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT25|Let me squeeze down the chart here.
NEUT26|Next key big battleground to watch moving forward and everybody and their brother's uncle is going to be watching.
NEUT27|This level is right up here at the 3280 Mark you can see quite the track record here of the price getting up there and then failing miserably, bouncing back up and then once again failing miserably.
NEUT28|So that doesn't mean that for sure guaranteed it will fail miserably.
NEUT29|Again if it gets back up there, it just makes sense though that there is a big question mark up there on whether or not the price is going to have enough strength and power to get up to that level.
BULL30|But All in all, very impressive movement today.
NEUT31|Let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT33|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT38|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT45|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT46|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT47|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT48|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
