NEUT0|"""Remember for back in the day when Amazon used to miss on the bottom line all the time and no one really cared and then we got used to them making more profits and now they're back to some losses or some misses."
NEUT1|I think the thing that stood out to me is actually the second quarter guidance.
BEAR2|I mean, we know that the first quarters or the back half of that was hurting everybody and we sort of maybe some softness.
NEUT3|But the fact that they're willing to give guidance?
BULL4|I know we're talking about that earlier, but also could be as much as 20% growth.
NEUT5|I mean, clearly Amazon is made for these times and it.
NEUT6|That guidance proves that the other thing that I notice their subscription service, which is their prime.
BULL7|Service was up 20% of the quarter.
NEUT8|That's not unusual, but it sort of gives you a sense that you know this idea of buying into a regular subscription, whether it's the media stop or more specifically, the delivery stuff is even more important now.
NEUT9|So two really strong parts of the business.
NEUT10|Clearly Michael, we kind of always wonder how much it's going to cost to deliver these products that we're all spending more on online.
BEAR11|Do we think this increasing costs is a one off because of this special environment, or is this a long term impact to their profitability?
NEUT12|I don't really think it's.
NEUT13|I don't think it's a long term impact, but the part I think people need to appreciate.
BEAR14|Yes, the operating income was weaker in the states.
BULL15|One of the things I would also highlight was a WS margins were actually quite a bit better, which was definitely an area of controversy.
NEUT16|But I mean this.
BEAR17|This hit everybody so fast.
NEUT18|Amazon, I think reacted very quickly but did exceptionally inefficient things.
BULL19|I suspect in the short term in terms of shipping costs, fulfillment, rushing to basically hire more folks.
NEUT20|So I think people are going to want to understand a little bit more.
NEUT21|When they're talking about the oh I guide for the second quarter with four billion of covid related costs, but my gut tells me that you're going to get out on the other end of this.
BULL22|This is going to be a much, much stronger business that you know this could be better.
NEUT23|Streamline the margins.
BULL24|"Ultimately, go to a better place."""
