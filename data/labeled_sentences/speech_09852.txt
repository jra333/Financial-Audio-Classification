BULL0|"""No everybody, thanks for watching this quick video."
NEUT1|Very quick video on Jill or Jill aid signs.
NEUT2|That is learning the US marketplace and we are one hour candle stick showing the price movement of this company that has been performing or let's say OK. Actually it's been treated a lot because or do it with high volatility since they started the race to the find.
NEUT3|Time to find a vaccine for the Corona virus.
BEAR4|So because it's been very volatile, it described all that tension attention from traders, banks and investors.
NEUT5|As we are right now we are.
NEUT6|Let's say that the prices mental is moving sideways without any particular trend.
NEUT7|Actually the this is we can be seen as one major wave uptrend and set back of this wave and now we are at the bottom level this way.
NEUT8|But we can do at this stage we can do.
NEUT9|Let's see if there is any opportunity to go.
NEUT10|Long there might be an opportunity on and if they support the level of 60 U.S. dollar will not be broken in the next week or days.
NEUT11|So if you're gonna couple or two, three of them daily candle stick state gonna be the closure.
NEUT12|The clue?
NEUT13|The clues?
NEUT14|Price of at least two or three.
BULL15|It's even better.
NEUT16|Three daily candle stick eats a bowl.
NEUT17|This support level for the next days of course, or perhaps even one week for the next week.
NEUT18|Let's say all the close.
NEUT19|The close price of this talk is always approve this support level.
NEUT20|The idea is to go longer because it means that this support is working as proper support, but if they're close the close price of a daily candlesticks going to be above or below below, it's not a right signal.
NEUT21|Is just a way, this is just a in all the actually if they will be in again a couple of days where in a row always in a row where the Adele the kinda close price or bodily candle stick is below.
BULL22|This 60 U.S. dollar it can be seen as a warning for us.
NEUT23|Just hold because the price can really can still really keep going down.
NEUT24|So as we are right now the idea with this talk is just old before going along and we can just call on.
NEUT25|If this support level will not be broken, this is mainly based on a technical analysis.
BEAR26|This is without my any technical analysis interpretation, as we can see, prices went up up and then down.
NEUT27|Just we can use even a little bit of exponential moving average that it worked as a support for some bottom.
NEUT28|So this uptrend then prices moved or regional and then this one worked as resistance for these minor or secondary trained this this is 1 peak bottom PIC bottom.
NEUT29|And now we are with my tech analysis in the British area we are exactly.
NEUT30|At the bottom of this support level that he worked already once as support, and actually many times as well even previously, and then in my work again as support.
NEUT31|So if we work as support, the idea is to go log but for now just all the anti what's going up in the next days.
NEUT32|"Thanks bye."""
