NEUT0|"""Give me a final trade if you could."
NEUT1|Pete yeah.
NEUT2|Sure, I'm going to give you GM and we continue to see option paper here as well, and this is a stock that just continues to move to the upside.
NEUT3|A lot of EV conversation going on there.
NEUT4|I think this is a name that moves to the upside.
BULL5|Still, even though it's made a substantial move, but I'd rather be in calls because of the fact that it's made such a quick move to the upside from 40 up towards 50.
NEUT6|I'd rather be in the calls in the stock.
NEUT7|Yeah, you're not the only one optimistic about it.
BULL8|Gets upgraded today at Nomura Instinet Tool by maybe a little late on the on the call, but.
NEUT9|The price target goes to 60, so you got some more upside there.
NEUT10|That's from 27 two so you can see what I'm talking about in terms of the miss of the rise.
NEUT11|Seurat you own GM as well.
NEUT12|It's one of your largest positions.
NEUT13|I do and I've owned it for last few years and it's been, you know, a right to know where basically, but I think the management team is now executing.
BULL14|They've shown what they've done through Covid and now you have the option value of electrical vehicles, so I do like that call.
NEUT15|OK, what's your final traits right?
NEUT16|Qualcomm stick with it and if you don't know in it like we talked about by it, I think this is a good one to for the next few years.
BULL17|OK Kerry before your final trade quickly, Home Depot upgraded today to a buy.
BEAR18|I've got some people have been trimming or selling out of that lately.
NEUT19|Like Stephanie Link you holding on to it.
NEUT20|Yeah, we are.
BULL21|We think it both has the reopening trade because there's a housing cycle that's in full steam ahead, and even though it's been a good stock outperform, we think it has more to go quickly.
NEUT22|What's your final trade for me today?
NEUT23|Yeah, Netflix been in a basing pattern.
BULL24|We think it can start to accelerate going forward.
NEUT25|Alright?
NEUT26|Joe, you got less than 10 seconds.
NEUT27|Reiterate on Cooper.
BULL28|"OK, Goober, thanks guys."""
