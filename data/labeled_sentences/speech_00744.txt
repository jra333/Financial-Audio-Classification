BULL0|"""Tesla, another stock we're watching today, up a whopping 600% so far this year as the company outperforms during this pandemic end as investors continue to pour money into the electric vehicle space."
BULL1|Now the stock's most recent breakout came last month following news that it would be included in the S&P 500 index.
NEUT2|And today we're getting details on just how Tesla will be added to the index and what that would mean for investors.
NEUT3|Yahoo Finance's Emily McCormick is here with those details.
NEUT4|Hi Emily.
NEUT5|Hi Alexis and as you mentioned, Tesla is set to be the largest company ever added to the S&P 500.
NEUT6|That company will join the index before the open of trading on Monday, December 21st based on its closing prices from Friday, December 18th.
NEUT7|Now we don't yet know what company specifically Tesla will be replacing in the index, although that is set to be announced in mid December.
NEUT8|Now importantly, Tesla is going to be added all at once into the S&P 500.
NEUT9|Remember that S&P Dow Jones indices had considered an unprecedented move.
BULL10|Of adding the company in multiple phases given its massive market capitalization of around $558 billion, now the company is set to be the 6th largest company in the S&P 500.
BEAR11|It has since pulled ahead of Berkshire Hathaway by market capitalization and its index weighting is expected to be a bit more than 1%.
BULL12|So going to be up there among some of those big tech names that are among the highest weighted in this index itself.
NEUT13|Now taking a look at the stock Tesla is.
BULL14|Adding to this year to date gains.
BULL15|Today it's trading just higher by about 1 1/2% in intraday trading.
BULL16|The stock has risen more than 40% since November 16th.
NEUT17|That's the day that S&P Dow Jones indices first announced the company would be included in the S&P 500 and even before that we had seen the stock pop starting in the spring and summer on speculation that it would get added to the index and those rumors only started to accelerate even further after the company delivered its fourth straight quarterly profit back in July.
BULL18|Now a lot of optimism around getting added to an.
NEUT19|Index of course has to do with the fact that more investors are going to have exposure to Tesla stock around $11.2 trillion in assets are benchmarked to the S&P 500, so a huge opportunity here for investors who may have stayed on the sidelines when it came to actually entering a position in Tesla shares specifically to actually get in here via in index fund or mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500.
NEUT20|So it will be interesting to see how this stock trades in the weeks leading up to December 21st.
NEUT21|Always an interesting one to watch here, Alexis.
NEUT22|Will be for sure.
NEUT23|We've been watching it will continue to Emily McCormack.
BULL24|"Thank you."""
