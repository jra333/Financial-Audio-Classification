NEUT0|"""Yeah, I want to go through some of these businesses because you have big steaks and we mentioned airlines."
NEUT1|For instance, let's just start with that and Delta is a big holding.
NEUT2|You have Holdings in the other three big ones as well.
NEUT3|And so how do you assess what's going to happen?
NEUT4|And does that change your outlook?
BEAR5|Well, it's going to be terrible, but I've always felt a pandemic without happening sometime.
NEUT6|I mean, I've I've actually used that term.
NEUT7|I mean, in describing things that can be in there that's going to interrupt.
NEUT8|The progress of not only this country, but the world.
NEUT9|It won't stop the progress of the country or the world.
BEAR10|I mean this is this is a terrible event that's occurring.
NEUT11|We don't know how terrible.
NEUT12|It may not turn out to be that big a deal.
NEUT13|When we got through, but it may turn out to be a very big deal and we just don't know and I certainly don't know and nobody knows.
NEUT14|But there will be other things that happen in the world in the next 5-10 twenty years.
NEUT15|That's the way the world works.
NEUT16|It doesn't.
NEUT17|It's not a totally even course.
NEUT18|The progress of mankind has been incredible and that won't stop you flew out here yesterday or today and and you flew over.
NEUT19|A country that.
NEUT20|250 years ago there was nothing here that's only three of my lifetimes, and there was nothing here.
NEUT21|And now you've got all these bottle farms and you got 200 and 260 million vehicles in the country and they got it.
NEUT22|80 million owner occupied homes and and you've got 155 million or whatever it is.
NEUT23|Million people working.
NEUT24|And I mean it's it's incredible.
NEUT25|I went, you know, when I had a medical check the other day, I went to incredible medical facilities that are just two or three minutes from here and.
NEUT26|That wasn't here, and even her 100 years ago, and so we keep making progress is we haven't.
NEUT27|We haven't forgotten how to make progress in this country and we haven't lost interest in making progress and that will benefit to varying degrees.
BEAR28|All kinds of people, including around the world, but there will be interruptions and I don't know when they will occur and I don't know how deep they will occur.
NEUT29|I do know they will occur from time to time and I also know that will come out better on the other end, so it doesn't sound like you're selling airline stocks today.
NEUT30|"I won't be selling airline stocks."""
