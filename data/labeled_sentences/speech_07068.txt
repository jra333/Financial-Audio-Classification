BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|I'm gonna be doing some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency Theta which is TH ETA.
NEUT2|Doing some technical analysis.
NEUT3|Just looking at the chart and letting you guys know what I think on this one.
NEUT4|So if we look at the chart for data I this is kind of an update video from 2 days ago on this red candle here, but I had kind of drawn out ultimately like this channel at this one was starting to put in between that like 11:20 ish to like 11.
NEUT5|$11.00 range all the way up to about that like 1330 level.
NEUT6|So I mean we kind of talked about this one potentially being like in a bit of a consolidation phase still so it did ultimately retest.
NEUT7|You know, the top of this trendline.
BULL8|This resistance level before pulling back to support on yesterday's candle.
BEAR9|Today it's retested that level yet again with these two lower wakes back to back and again, the volume is still really weak compared to this breakout level.
BEAR10|So I mean it is consolidating on some lower volume, which I do like to see.
NEUT11|So again, I would like to just see this like 11 till like 1130 level.
NEUT12|I mean this is a level that needs to hold.
NEUT13|You could potentially lower it as low as like 10:50, but I would say.
NEUT14|Anywhere from like 11:00 to 11:30 at this point is the risk level and then to really turn this one bullish again needs to be a break of about that 1330 ish level, especially with some volume.
BULL15|If that level can get broken in this, one can close above there with some good volume.
BEAR16|I don't see any reason why this one can't push back up to the highs just below 15 and potentially even break 15 and continue to run.
NEUT17|Should I be like the ideal bullish scenario?
BEAR18|This level starts to get lossed?
NEUT19|This chart really doesn't have a great shape to it, and you know the next stop could potentially be the mid to low 10s.
NEUT20|Lose that and we're probably heading back into the nines, so I mean those are like the shorter term levels to watch as far as support go.
NEUT21|I mean with Ethereum breaking out though.
BULL22|And the crypto market staying hot.
NEUT23|I think that's pretty bullish for all coins, so I mean it's going to be really interesting to see how this one plays out.
NEUT24|It's hard to really say whether I'm bullish or bearish at this point in the shorter term, just 'cause it's just consolidating in this channel.
NEUT25|But I'll tell you one thing like if it was me, personally, I might have some skin in the game at this point.
NEUT26|Respect the risk level on this one, and then potentially add into a breakout and retest of this 1330 mark, but that would be my own personal plans.
NEUT27|Like as always, I always tell people just develop your own plan and your own strategy.
NEUT28|Because these levels are pretty clear, there's not a whole lot more to talk about on this one.
NEUT29|It's still the same as last TI a video.
NEUT30|We just need to see which direction this is going to pick.
NEUT31|This is kind of like a skin in the game level point at this point to me.
NEUT32|So if you found this video valuable at all, go ahead and like, comment, subscribe and share.
NEUT33|And as always, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT34|"This video is not financial advice for going to do any investing it go speak to a certified financial advisor and thank you for watching."""
