NEUT0|"""Very well, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
BEAR1|We can see here today Apple has formed a very small red candle and it dropped only zero point 1%.
BULL2|So with very small volume is a healthy sign in shorter because the selling.
NEUT3|Has no great change and also the selling has small volume means there's no not so much selling so after the consolidation.
BULL4|A small setting is a healthy sign under constructive side.
NEUT5|And if the price keeps.
NEUT6|Within the consolidation area.
BEAR7|And the volume decreased.
BEAR8|Then it means it has lost the interest from the institution.
BEAR9|So as long as it keeps small, we cannot see any uptrend intention for from Apple.
NEUT10|So maybe someday the warm with low jump higher compared to normal like this one.
NEUT11|Then they'll see.
NEUT12|There's some motive from the institution, so now we can see nothing.
NEUT13|There's no one, but no one saw it.
NEUT14|So in my opinion it has.
NEUT15|Within a consolidation area for enough time and if we change it to a medium pattern.
NEUT16|It's a vaguely chart.
NEUT17|Then I can see here.
NEUT18|The volume for this week is.
BEAR19|Extremely low, it means it can hardly hold at this position.
NEUT20|So I need.
BEAR21|Change from here will be a big tent because the volume here is too low.
BEAR22|It's extremely low compared to all the water before it and also we have now for several weeks within this feeding area.
NEUT23|Another constructive side is that we have.
NEUT24|These two laws, as face as supporting.
NEUT25|But the.
NEUT26|Resistance is hanging above as the top of this candle.
NEUT27|So let's wait and see what will happen.
NEUT28|The decision will be made very soon.
BULL29|"Thank you."""
