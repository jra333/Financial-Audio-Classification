NEUT0|"""I'm Josh buzz."
NEUT1|I mean, social media is a new phenomenon for tracking stock performance I guess.
NEUT2|Yeah, no, it is.
NEUT3|I may be there may be there are trades to be done with this, but like from a long term investing perspective, because it's a monthly rebalanced, the Holdings will be so radically different from like let's say January to December.
NEUT4|So if you're like a longer term investor like, what do you?
NEUT5|What are you investing in really?
NEUT6|So I don't have an issue with it.
NEUT7|I understand that markets have changed and obviously social.
NEUT8|I you know, I was somebody that was watching this whole thing develop from within.
NEUT9|So I understand that there's a lot of signal coming out of social media, I just don't know that that's something that I necessarily need, but will be really interesting to watch.
NEUT10|Whether or not this thing the tracks flows and I would just say so far everything Portnoy he's touched has turned to gold.
NEUT11|So a lot of people were saying the Penn Gaming thing was a bubble when the Barstool deal was announced.
NEUT12|They were like, who cares?
NEUT13|It's just these Internet guys, blah blah blah.
NEUT14|This could be one of the largest market cap gaming companies in the country by the time bar stool.
NEUT15|And their personalities are done marketing it and promoting it and doing events with them.
NEUT16|So I don't know that I'd want to bet against this.
NEUT17|Finding an audience, it just doesn't necessarily fit in with the way that that I'm investing, but there's nothing that doesn't mean it's good or bad and just one quick point on that is, it's not as if the industry has neglected this idea of mining social datasets to try to trade.
NEUT18|I mean, this is just the retail version of an activity that's been going on in a very high powered way, and his entire trading systems based hedge funds are doing this for a very long time.
NEUT19|So this is just kind of.
NEUT20|This is like your version of it to trade in the Stock Exchange.
NEUT21|Or also my to that point using AI you know alot alot alot of people, a lot of people would mock this idea.
NEUT22|Oh it's just a heart you're going to get all these people to hurt themselves into a herd or they would say like they would say oh that's so corny that's the top for fin twit or whatever.
NEUT23|This is not very far apart from people that were following foot traffic at different stores in the mall in the 1980s and 90s like it's not that different.
NEUT24|It's just faster paced.
NEUT25|And arguably more sophisticated, not less so.
NEUT26|Wall Street people have always been looking for ways to gauge the feelings of the crowd, and this is just one more way to do it.
NEUT27|I'm not really an expert in the portfolio construction of the of this particular ETF.
NEUT28|I haven't looked closely at it.
NEUT29|I would just say people have always wanted to know what's hot.
NEUT30|Water people talking about.
NEUT31|It's not new and so it's not quite as gimmicky as maybe people are saying it is.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
