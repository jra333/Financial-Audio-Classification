NEUT0|"""Think of economic indicators as pieces of a puzzle."
NEUT1|They tell you something specific and together help you create an accurate picture of reality.
NEUT2|There are three broad types of indicators, one leading indicators, which tend to change before the economy as a whole changes.
BEAR3|Building permits are a good example, because if you notice that people and companies have less and less of an appetite for building, it's a warning sign that economic activity is slowing down.
NEUT4|Other examples include share prices, net business formations in the money supply, two lagging indicators which tend to change after the economy changes.
NEUT5|The unemployment rate is a decent example because when jobs are scarce, it's clear that's happening because the economy was.
BEAR6|Already going through a rough Patch.
NEUT7|The Consumer Price index default rates and interest rates.
NEUT8|Three coincident indicators which change it pretty much the same time as the economy.
NEUT9|The GDP is a good example if you want a snapshot of the economy, whereas other examples include non farm payrolls and personal income.
NEUT10|An individual indicator usually doesn't tell you enough on its own, as such conclusions should be drawn after analyzing multiple indicators.
BEAR11|For example, if this year's GDP is higher than last years, but building permits are on a downward slope, you might have valid reasons to worry that economic growth will slow down, or if the unemployment rate is currently high.
BULL12|"Something like growing net business formation numbers can give you hope and so on."""
