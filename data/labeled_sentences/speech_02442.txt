NEUT0|"""Disney, you might say they hit a home run."
NEUT1|Dan Roberts knows more about this.
NEUT2|He spent four hours listening to the presentation yesterday and then, what do you think is the big takeaway from this?
NEUT3|Is it the movie theaters angle or is it 230,000,000 potential subscribers within three years to Disney Plus?
NEUT4|Yeah Adam, I think that the biggest kind of take away, or at least what I was most struck by the sheer volume of content announced.
NEUT5|I mean a mountain of content coming to Disney's three streaming platforms in the next three to four years.
NEUT6|Just yesterday, he said four hours.
NEUT7|It's really close to five hours, they announced 60 new shows, 40 new movies.
BULL8|It's kind of mind boggling, and it's interesting because in the first year of Disney plus, it thrived and got to 86 million subscribers on only one original series.
NEUT9|It had a single original show and that was the Mandalorian, but that was enough.
NEUT10|Now of course for its next kind of phase, Disney is just going kitchen sink strategy, kind of like Netflix.
NEUT11|In fact, Bob Eiger came out at the end of the presentation and said that, uh, Disney aims to put 100 new things that could be shows or movies on Disney plus every year starting soon.
NEUT12|So the sheer volume is crazy.
NEUT13|Now 86 million subscribers for Disney.
NEUT14|Plus of course, that's already way past.
NEUT15|Its projections were when it launched a year ago.
NEUT16|Disney said that it aimed for 60 to 90 million by 2024.
BEAR17|So now Disney has revised its streaming.
NEUT18|Subscriber projections, as you said, up to 200 thirty 260 million by 2024, and I'd also zoom out and point you to a big picture financial projection, which is that Disney plus should be profitable, they say by 2024 first, so it will lose a lot more money.
BULL19|CFO Christine McCarthy said that next year, in 2021, she believes Disney Plus should peak in terms of its losses, but they're spending a lot on this platform.
NEUT20|And of course it's not just Disney.
NEUT21|Plus, it's Hulu.
NEUT22|It's ESPN Plus, and the other big takeaway for the sports fans in the building.
BEAR23|Disney and ABC cutting a new deal with the SEC Network that will start in 2024 to make Disney's networks the home of SEC College football.
NEUT24|So a lot of news.
NEUT25|It's kind of overwhelming, but I think if you just take it as a whole you see why Disney hit all time highs today and then hit new all time highs.
BULL26|It's up 14% right now wild.
NEUT27|This is maybe inside baseball.
NEUT28|For Disney.
NEUT29|You would know though how much of this is and I will miss pronounce his last name correctly.
NEUT30|Bob shaping the new CEO.
NEUT31|How much of this is his stewardship or how much of this is Bob Eiger pulling strings behind the scenes?
NEUT32|Yeah this is Bob Eiger.
NEUT33|You know all due respect to JPEG who was running parks and let's remember before the pandemic theme parks were the profit engine of this company.
NEUT34|Of course, now we're all talking about streaming.
BULL35|Disney has successfully kind of distracted the market and said look over here, it's streaming.
BULL36|We saw that even though Disney had a loss for its 2020 fiscal year after its Q4 earnings a month ago, stock went up anyway because investors are now bullish enough on streaming that they'll ignore the other bad news anyway, I'll do respect about shaping who was running parks and is now CEO.
NEUT37|You know, Eiger is almost CEO in all but name.
NEUT38|He's still there as chairman.
BULL39|And he's now heading up the creative pipeline.
NEUT40|And of course, stories have reported that this is his real passion.
NEUT41|He's always wanted to be in charge of the content.
NEUT42|The creative he came out at the beginning of the call and assured investors that even though they're announcing so much stuff, so much sheer volume, he said, Disney always wants to focus on quality over volume.
NEUT43|Although man, considering the number of things in Arabic or hard to buy them like volume.
NEUT44|Original content push.
NEUT45|Dan in 20 seconds.
NEUT46|Can you convince us why theaters movie theaters will not be dead in two years?
NEUT47|Yeah look, I'm a lover movie theater so I'm a little biased, but I think we're going to vaccine eventually.
NEUT48|People will return to theaters.
NEUT49|Maybe they'll still want to wear masks.
NEUT50|Maybe they'll still block off Rose, but Disney proof that it's still committed to theaters.
NEUT51|It didn't go.
NEUT52|"The Warner Brothers route by announcing that it's 2021 movies will go straight to streaming it still planning and hoping for big blockbuster releases with things like Black Widow, another Marvel movies."""
