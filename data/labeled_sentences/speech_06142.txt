BEAR0|"""Kevin, what do you say is the market a little endangered because the prices have gotten so high and if there are any slipups as interest as excuse me, earning season gets underway."
NEUT1|It's they're really going to take it out on stocks.
BULL2|Yes, I think the market is priced for perfection.
NEUT3|Is price such that it wants to make sure that the rollout goes out smoothly.
BULL4|We continue to get vaccines done.
BULL5|We reopen the economy and that we have a good strong earning season.
BULL6|An all of those things so far seem to be on track.
BEAR7|When you are looking at GDP being forecast to be 6%, I think that there going to be some upside surprises that occur during earning season.
BEAR8|However, if we do have a slip up, I do feel that the market could pull back here.
BULL9|We started this year out with 175 operating earnings on the S&P and if you put a 23 multiple on that, we're right about where we thought we would in the year.
BULL10|So it has been a strong start to the year so thus far.
NEUT11|Victoria, you say that the credit markets are almost always the Canary in the coal mine for stocks.
NEUT12|What are the credit markets saying right now?
BULL13|You know, surprisingly, with some of the volatility that we had seen over the past couple of weeks with people doing that rotation between value in between growth, the credit markets have been really stable and for us combining that along with what Bob was mentioning with the breath that we're seeing of stocks doing well and hitting highs in the equity market.
NEUT14|That's telling us that there really isn't a reason to be terribly concerned at this point in time.
NEUT15|With a huge pull back, can we have a pause in the market?
NEUT16|We can.
BULL17|But the credit market is stable, high yield is stable investment, greatest stable.
BULL18|That's telling us that there is anticipation.
BULL19|Earnings is going to do well in.
BULL20|Corporations are going to have good guidance going forward.
