NEUT0|"""Pickups are **** in retail."
NEUT1|Investors can understand that story, but the original idea of the company was heavy duty trucks that were going to be able to eventually do long haul, and that's kind of the idea of this future of long haul transportation is potentially going with fuel cell technology and not the battery technology that we see in a car like Tesla and so.
NEUT2|Essentially it's changing.
NEUT3|The bet is Nicola going to be this company that helps usher in a new way of trucking.
NEUT4|Previously the bet was maybe they were going to pick up truck that was going to rival the cyber truck.
NEUT5|Elon Musk is bringing the market.
NEUT6|That's interesting, so let's kind of go back over that.
NEUT7|You know GM is interested primarily in what part of Nicholas business do you think?
NEUT8|Well, you know it's interesting having covered GM for a long time, and that some of the folks involved in kind of the Nicola deal.
NEUT9|They have long talked about the potential for fuel cell technology.
NEUT10|GM had been exploring that technology for a couple generations.
NEUT11|It's the idea that it would be a more efficient way to move vehicles long distances, and really, that potential is maybe what GMC's in the future, there, in part because.
NEUT12|It helps them commercialize that technology that we've been developing.
NEUT13|And so, in theory, if this still plays out, here could be a customer for that.
NEUT14|Technology helps them put in the tooling and pay for that technology and maybe develop a market for it's really been.
NEUT15|The issue is been a chicken or egg kind of thing.
NEUT16|You're going to have these filling stations or they're going to customers and it just has kind of slowly rolled out there.
NEUT17|In a world where everybody wants to talk about Tesla because electric cars are on the road now and they're being powered by a sensually while they were being powered, essentially by laptop batteries.
NEUT18|So here's my question.
NEUT19|Tim, what is the path forward for Nicola?
NEUT20|Has it significantly changed in light of today's news or not?
NEUT21|And why is Jim staying involved?
NEUT22|Is this just kind of a flyer for it, or is it you think a significant part of its future investments?
NEUT23|Well, it would seem that they took a look under the hood and didn't want to necessarily bet a lot on the company going forward.
BULL24|The idea that they were originally going to get an equity stake, but this at least potentially provides them with a client for that fuel cell technology, so that could potentially be a win for GM for Nicola.
NEUT25|You know, in perhaps this allows them to focus on that kind of original idea of heavy duty trucks.
NEUT26|They have an electric truck planned for late next year in Europe and then fuel cells in the future.
BEAR27|Really getting back to the original idea, so that could help them, but really the challenge is going to be that they've been betting on the fact that bigger deep pocketed companies were going to be helping them usher in this technology and the loss of GM is really a loss of a huge endorsement that helped fuel that massive spike in value and value that we saw in the shares in the last few months.
