NEUT0|"""At the beginning of the year, one of the executives, Tesla asked me what I thought the stock was a 200 below 200."
NEUT1|Yeah and he asked me what I thought the stock would do this year and I said I thought that with the introduction of model three, I thought this talk sometime this year would be 350 or 400 and I think it's going to be 5 or 600 next year and I think it's going to be 1000 in 2020 when there at that time.
NEUT2|I think they'll be doing 70 billion in revenues and making 10 billion in profits.
NEUT3|Operating profits before they spend it to grow more.
NEUT4|And that's with a million cars a year and the beginning of a contribution from.
NEUT5|Solar roofs from batteries.
NEUT6|Nothing for mobility yet, but that's that's just a million cars.
NEUT7|There's 91 million cars in the in the world that are sold a year.
NEUT8|I think they're going to have a significant portion of those at some point, so I think that this is just, you know, when.
NEUT9|When you asked me before to come on and take a victory lap because it's gone from 200 to 300, that's not a victory lap.
NEUT10|This is just starting in my opinion, and that was before, by the way, before $0.10 had made an investment in.
NEUT11|This company Tencent, you know who they are, the Chinese company.
BULL12|Yeah, Chinese company is the largest publicly owned Chinese company, the fastest growing 300 billion market cap, 320 billion market cap.
NEUT13|So they bought 5% of Tesla.
NEUT14|That was announced a couple of months ago a month ago, and they paid a billion 8 so they paid an average price of 217.
NEUT15|This is $0.10, and so I think that there's a passive investment right now, but they're studying it and I think that the reason so we have an investment in Tencent.
NEUT16|In our emerging market fund and our guy met with him recently and he was telling me that he thought that they made their investment in Tesla because they wanted to get investment before Baidu and before Alibaba they wanted to beat those guys to investing in test.
