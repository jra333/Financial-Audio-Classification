BULL0|"""CC Ivy has again rallied today by around 30% to a price of $41.01 from the initial $10 of this pack."
BULL1|This means the stock has more than quadrupled in value, just on an unconfirmed rumor.
NEUT2|Although this rumor is seeming increasingly likely to become true recently, a Bloomberg Terminal update came to light.
NEUT3|This suggests that a group of investors, led by venture capital firm Venrock Associates, are looking to sell lucid Motors.
NEUT4|For those of you who don't know.
NEUT5|Bloomberg Terminal is computer system which grants access to the Bloomberg Data Service.
NEUT6|This provides real time, global financial data, news and messages.
NEUT7|It can also be used to place trades.
NEUT8|The terminal note suggested that Venrock associates proposed to sell lucid Motors to see Ivy on the 11th of January.
NEUT9|Venrock is one of the oldest investors in Lucid Motors.
NEUT10|They bought the company when it was only a small battery manufacturer with a different name.
NEUT11|There's no financial information given on the screenshot.
BULL12|Regardless, this is given investors more confidence that the merger between Lucid Motors and Spark Civ will occur.
NEUT13|All recent news tends to shows the merger is more likely, and at the very least is not being denied by either Lucid or Churchill, which of course is great.
BULL14|It's very clear that investors love electronic vehicle, EV stocks, and lucid Motors seems to be one of the better electronic vehicle companies.
NEUT15|It's clear why the stock is rallying so much, however, this does seem somewhat extreme as it's based on unconfirmed rumor.
NEUT16|$40 that's four times the $10 initial offering.
BEAR17|So if the deals fall through, it's really likely that the stock will collapse back down to $10.
NEUT18|Of course, I'm not complaining.
NEUT19|I own the stock and I'm still bullish on it.
NEUT20|Appana merger.
BULL21|I think this stock could easily double again to around $80.00 in the future.
BULL22|It could probably even do better than this.
NEUT23|I reckon it could reach $100, although this is just my opinion.
NEUT24|I don't really know.
NEUT25|Remember, I'm not a financial advisor.
