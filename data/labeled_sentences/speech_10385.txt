NEUT1|It automated warehousing.
NEUT2|This is what the CEO told Jim yesterday at CNBC CNBC's Evolve Summit.
NEUT3|The businesses is booming right now and it's not a surprise.
NEUT4|I mean, obviously the covid era really drove to home delivery, warehouse automation and so on.
BULL5|And and we've been expanding that business very quickly in the US, but also were growing internationally and and we're trying to move it even more towards.
NEUT6|The use of robotics.
BULL7|You said you know what we call a dark warehouse, which is, you know, minimizing the labor in a warehouse, and we're making great progress and winning a lot of jobs.
BULL8|So it's been a great bookings year for Intelligrated.
NEUT9|But I I think it's only the beginning.
NEUT10|I, I don't think that sort of home delivery, personal delivery.
NEUT11|I don't.
NEUT12|Yeah sure.
BULL13|Covid accelerated that trend, but it's something that's going to continue and in our Intelligrated business is leading to charge to enable customers to make that leap.
NEUT14|Jim, it's a long way from avionics and thermostats.
NEUT15|Yes, it sure is, and the new Honeywell is basically a software company as well as a hardware company.
NEUT16|It's also a software as a service company where you literally can hire them and they will figure out software solutions for you.
NEUT17|This is a very good business and there's really I don't even know if they can handle the business they have given the fact that what?
NEUT18|What do we know?
NEUT19|We know that this is a warehouse economy.
NEUT20|An yet warehouses are still run the way they used to be years ago.
NEUT21|Zebras, the other company by the way, that is making a fortune to CBS.
NEUT22|So I I, I do think the boozy bra and Honeywell are terrific tone.
