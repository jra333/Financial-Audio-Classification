NEUT6|I see this as a resistance level an I saw this as a support level.
NEUT7|As you can see since really like on this day.
NEUT8|This is why like December 15th, Price has been just trading in this range.
NEUT9|It came up came back down in the range pop pop down, pop right back up came in the range just been coming in and went up here.
NEUT10|I think it was just a high part that's why I didn't get in.
NEUT11|Came back down and then won't drop look all hard to drop the right back into this range.
NEUT12|So this stock right now is range bound.
NEUT13|Assessment rate and all through here.
NEUT14|Like I said, these are key support and resistance levels like real support and resistance levels.
NEUT15|So as you can see price is right on these levels, so this resistance level is 2531 and this support level is 2383.
NEUT16|So you can have these on your chart.
NEUT17|And what we're looking for is for it to break out on either side.
NEUT18|OK, 'cause I see resistance levels appear and I see support levels below the market, but I want to see what side it wants to go out of right now because it's been traded in a range for a little long and I think it is time do for some movement out one of these, so make sure you guys check out my Patreon link down below.
NEUT19|My Patreon is for buy and sell alerts.
BULL20|The price is going up in February, so make sure you guys check that out.
NEUT21|So like I said, I want to see it either come up here, test this as support, then we can look for higher highs or I want to see a breakdown here.
NEUT22|Tested as resistance then then we see lower lows, but until it gets out of this range we would just be watching the stock.
BULL23|And I'll keep making updates as I see fit, but that is good for this video.
