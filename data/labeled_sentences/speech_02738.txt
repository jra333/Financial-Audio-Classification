BULL0|"""So I think we're going to see another good report, 200,000 in line with the year to date trend."
NEUT1|I know they're all of the labor market indicators that we've seen over the course of the month of August suggests that this economy and this labor market remains white hot.
NEUT2|ADP was a little light yesterday and some people say that's just what happens in August.
NEUT3|You're going later readings that then get revised higher later.
NEUT4|We see that that is the trend over the last 10 years.
BEAR5|8 out of 10 times the initial print for August has been weaker on average by about 40,000.
NEUT6|And then you get revised up by around 50,000, so we won't discount that.
NEUT7|You always have to sort of take all you know, all these numbers month to month with a grain of salt we had in July.
BEAR8|A disappointing report, although that was due to the one off factor, I think with the Toys R Us closures, so there's always noise in these numbers.
NEUT9|That's why we sort of look at the three month trends.
NEUT10|And as I said, our number would keep the three month trend around, just over 200,000.
NEUT11|Incredibly impressive at this point in the site, we have LaSalle coming on it in a little while.
NEUT12|You should hang out to watch.
NEUT13|I was reading and I couldn't believe it.
NEUT14|He goes.
NEUT15|It sounded bad that there's no employee loyalty anymore, but the reason there's no employee loyalty is because there's so many good opportunities elsewhere and shove it.
NEUT16|It's fine.
NEUT17|You need workers market again, and you need to supposedly do more and more to retain employees by giving them the type of corporate culture.
NEUT18|And then he says that he doesn't mean ping pong tables and kegs, which I think is great, but that's there's nothing wrong with that.
NEUT19|You like pot too.
NEUT20|Yeah?
BULL21|Well, that's so strong.
NEUT22|OK, Andrew, am I right?
NEUT23|I mean it is.
NEUT24|It's like you're looking at the wrong person.
BEAR25|OK mentioned in the in the lead up, the shortage of workers and the difficulty that.
BEAR26|Firms are having to find workers, so they do need to try to keep the workers that they have because it is so very difficult to be able to replace them if they leave Jim.
NEUT27|How about you?
NEUT28|What are you looking for?
BULL29|Good morning, Becky.
BEAR30|I agree the trend is still very strong 200,000 or better per month, but I think the August numbers do tend to be weak so I'm going for the lower number today.
NEUT31|I've got 165.
NEUT32|But you think that that is a lower number because of the August 1 off or you think yeah, no, this is just the Upson Downs from month to month.
NEUT33|It's the technicalities mean.
BULL34|Obviously yesterday you saw another new Post 1969 low for jobless claims and the ISMA employment numbers that came out this week were booming.
BULL35|So I think it's pretty clear the trend is very strong and the trends in 200,000 or better.
BEAR36|So I don't see any slowing whatsoever in the trend.
BEAR37|But I just think the August number will probably print on the lower side nonetheless.
BEAR38|So you just really lowered expectations now.
NEUT39|I mean, I don't know how do you have a bed and I have to be 120.
BEAR40|To for people to say this is bad, I guess an again against the backdrop of all of the numbers that Jim talked about.
NEUT41|Everybody is going to be, I think, very tolerant of an initial print.
BEAR42|It looks a little bit disappointed with its 200.
NEUT43|Then it's going to be holy, you know.
NEUT44|Again, we've just continued to see on going strengthen this account, which is the August numbers.
NEUT45|Whether we're talking about the SME's consumer confidence.
BULL46|I mean there's a resilience there even in the face of increased uncertainty concerns about toy.
NEUT47|This is all happening before the New York Times op, Ed.
NEUT48|We'll see how that affects a lot of the policies in the economy and stuff.
NEUT49|"'cause that's not in these numbers yet."""
