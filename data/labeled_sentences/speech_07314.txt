BULL0|"""U.S. stocks look sharp to begin the fourth quarter."
BULL1|But we got our markets up host Paul Vigna joining us.
BEAR2|Also disgruntled Giants fan this morning.
NEUT3|I don't talk about you start talking back so I don't wanna talk about it.
NEUT4|OK, I will talk about stocks though.
NEUT5|Hideout gonna need a little.
BULL6|I know I understand.
NEUT7|I understand Dow futures up S&P futures.
BULL8|All the future markets are up started the fourth quarter.
NEUT9|The proverbial new money coming in that kind of thing.
NEUT10|Usually these quarters get off to a good start, so that's what's happening.
NEUT11|That's really what 'cause you'll hear people say.
BULL12|Oh well, the you know the manufacturing reports looked better than expected.
NEUT13|We got the other part.
NEUT14|A big manufacturing reports out of China out of Europe will get one this morning at 10:00 AM for the US.
NEUT15|The key thing is that these reports are still under 50.
NEUT16|Their indexes.
NEUT17|The diffusion index is 50 above 50 equals expansion below exactly right there.
BEAR18|They're still in China in Europe under 50, so you're still seeing a contraction in those regions will get the US1 today.
NEUT19|Attend.
NEUT20|Like I said, we'll see where that one goes.
NEUT21|That one, I believe was under 50 last time it was, so we'll see if that gets above it or not.
BEAR22|That's not a good sign.
BEAR23|I mean, it was not a good sign.
NEUT24|So if the market was really so, what's perking up the market today?
NEUT25|Well, that's what it is.
NEUT26|Is just the beginning.
BULL27|New quarter new money comes in.
NEUT28|That whole kind of.
NEUT29|It's really nothing fundamental.
NEUT30|It's just there you go new quarter little week.
BEAR31|Last week we ended the weeks, you know, kind of beatdown.
NEUT32|So maybe it'll turn around there.
NEUT33|But really, this is just nothing really fundamental.
NEUT34|That's my real point there.
NEUT35|OK, by the way.
NEUT36|Xstrata, Glencore, that maybe that could maybe now go through there was a big snack is a big big deal.
NEUT37|In the commodities mining market, $70 billion merger which got tripped up over effectively retention payments go exactly extra extra right, right?
NEUT38|Right?
NEUT39|So now they think they have found a way around that.
NEUT40|It's kind of a.
NEUT41|It's a convoluted way that they're going to structure the vote.
BEAR42|It's a two step process before they could not approve the deal without these retention payments to the extra.
NEUT43|So now they think they've figured out a way around it that they can get an approval without guaranteeing those those retention bonuses.
NEUT44|The market seems to like it, so the market seems to be buying into it.
NEUT45|We'll have to see yet whether shareholders buy into it.
NEUT46|I mean, it's it's an end around.
NEUT47|Will shareholders go for not?
NEUT48|That's another question, but the extra board is now on board with this so big deal in commodity markets taking a step closer to getting done.
BULL49|"OK, thanks so much."""
