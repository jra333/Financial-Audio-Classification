NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol JMI A we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT2|By 30 minute I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Done this analysis several times before, so that is where the red and green line annotations are coming from.
NEUT4|But after today's price movement very significant.
NEUT5|From a technical point of view and this will be a little bit more of those that have watched the past videos I've done.
NEUT6|But even if you have a quick recap, I've talked about that red line several times in past videos as being a very important level of resistance.
BULL7|And finally, after spending a couple of days consolidating down below that level, the price is now been able to work its way up through this 1865 mark.
NEUT8|So breakout is officially underway.
NEUT9|The big question now going into next week is, like I said, OK. Breakout underway, but is there true power behind this?
NEUT10|My price movement is this the start of a bigger breakout or is this just going to be one of these?
BEAR11|You know, faulty breakouts.
NEUT12|And even if you traded long enough we've all had.
BEAR13|You know we bought a breakout and then the price just goes right back down and which is still a possibility given the price is still relatively close to that area.
NEUT14|Now, let me be very clear.
NEUT15|I'm not saying that the price is going to rollback over.
NEUT16|I'm not saying this is the fake breakout, I'm just saying that where the price is currently sitting right now, it's a more than valid concern to have that.
NEUT17|Yeah, it's broken out, sure, but I don't know.
NEUT18|Is there any sort of true power behind it?
NEUT19|So more of the story here.
NEUT20|The very important level what's going forward is 1865, because as long as the price stays above that level, so even if it comes on here, bounces around well, at least at that point time, what's that still giving you?
NEUT21|Well, that's still giving you a set of those there and then you'd have low is there and you have those lows and then those lows and you picture this stair steps.
BEAR22|Now you know you still have progress being made in the upward direction, but if the price falls back below that area now, that doesn't mean that the entire charts destroyed.
NEUT23|That just means that as far as the breakout is concerned, well it was a fake breakout 'cause now setting the price would be right back to where it was so 1865.
NEUT24|Very, very important level to watch going forward and that is now the level that you would definitely want to act as support, which is just the foundational rule in charting when resistance is broken you want to see them act as support in the event the price does continue on up.
NEUT25|Next, key level resistance to watch.
NEUT26|Closely going to be right up there around $21, but in my opinion at least, the more pressing dynamic is whether or not the price can see above 1865.
NEUT27|So let's see how next week plays out.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
