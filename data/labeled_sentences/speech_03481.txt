BULL0|"""Hello everybody, thanks for watching this quick video."
NEUT1|Very quick video on Jill or Jill aid signs.
NEUT2|That is learning the US marketplace and we are one hour candle stick showing the price movement of this company that has been performing or let's say OK. Actually it's been treated a lot because or do it with high volatility since they started the race to the find.
NEUT3|Trying to find the vaccine for the Corona virus.
BEAR4|So because it's been very volatile, it described all the attention attention from traders, banks and investors.
NEUT5|As we are right now we are.
NEUT6|Let's say that the prices mental is moving sideways without any particular trend.
NEUT7|Actually the this is we can be seen as one merger, wave up, trained and set back of this wave and now we are at the bottom level this way.
NEUT8|But we can do at this stage we can do.
NEUT9|Let's see if there is any opportunity to go.
NEUT10|Long there might be an opportunity on and if they support the level of 60 U.S. dollar will not be broken in the next week or days.
NEUT11|So if you're gonna have a couple or two three of them, a daily candle stick state gonna be the closure, the clue?
NEUT12|The clues?
NEUT13|Price of at least two or three.
NEUT14|It's remembered three daily candle stick eats a bowl.
NEUT15|This support level for the next days of course, or perhaps even one week for the next week.
NEUT16|Let's say all the clothes.
NEUT17|The clothes price of this talk is always approve this support level.
NEUT18|The idea is to go longer because it means that this support is working as proper support, but if they're close the close price of a daily candlesticks cannot be above, below, or below.
NEUT19|It's not a right signal.
NEUT20|Long is just a way.
NEUT21|This is just a in all the actually if they will be in again a couple of days where in a row always in a row where the Adele the kinda close price of idyllic and seek is below.
BULL22|This 60 U.S. dollar it can be seen as a warning for us.
NEUT23|Just hold because the price really can still really keep going down.
NEUT24|So as we are right now the idea with this talk is just old before going along and we can just call on.
NEUT25|If this support level will not be broken, this is mainly based on a technical analysis.
BEAR26|This is without my any technical analysis interpretation, as we can see, prices went up up and then down.
NEUT27|Just we can use even a little bit of exponential moving average that it worked as a support for some bottom.
NEUT28|So this uptrend then prices moved or regional and then this one worked as resistance for these minor or secondary trained.
NEUT29|This is 1 peak bottom pic bottom.
NEUT30|And now we are with my tech analysis interpretation area.
NEUT31|We are exactly.
NEUT32|At the bottom of this support level that he worked already, once a support and actually many times as well, even previously, and then in my work again as support.
NEUT33|So if we work as support, the idea is to go log.
NEUT34|But for now just all the and see what's coming up in the next days.
NEUT35|"Thanks bye."""
