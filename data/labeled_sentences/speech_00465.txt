NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back when the video today it is your boy will today I'll be talking about Virgin Galactic, ticker symbol, SPCESPCE stock and I'll give you guys some key analysts and predictions.
NEUT2|And also how are you playing the stock?
NEUT3|I do want to start giving some shares on the stock longer term.
BULL4|I do believe in the space exploration and I do think we will be going far on all this type of space and all those type of services do with space because they're starting to do more with Expeditions and stuff because for awhile we kind of stopped going like to the Moon and Mars, but now we're ramping it up, so I think this stock is will do good in the future.
NEUT5|OK, this is more of a longer term hold for me just so you guys know I make sure you guys like the video, hit that subscribe button, turn falsification so you don't miss any updates.
NEUT6|Let's get into it.
BEAR7|So as the stock went up, you guys know I don't like being in high prices.
BEAR8|Elevated and then it started dropping.
BULL9|Now, as it was going back up right here, I saw some resistance at.
NEUT10|I'll draw it out for you.
BULL11|I saw some resistance around this morning.
NEUT12|5157 Ohio 51.
BEAR13|Yeah, 5157 is where I saw some resistance at right here.
NEUT14|Make that red.
BEAR15|OK, so this is where I was seeing some resistance, so as it was going back up I didn't want to buy yet.
NEUT16|OK, I want to see how late act at this resistance line at 5459 OK and she can tell resistance drop down.
BULL17|Came back resistance drop down came back again.
NEUT18|Passed it a little bit.
NEUT19|Drop down right came back up.
BEAR20|Drop down again so this is a key resistance.
NEUT21|That's why I've been bought any shares yet.
NEUT22|I do want to see how it acts at this level.
BEAR23|OK now once it starts breaking up to this level and actually training higher, then they'll be more bullish than in going like this and just dropping right after this right here is showing signs of weakness and I don't want to buy it.
NEUT24|Just get now.
NEUT25|My key area that I really want to buy the stock at is around $45.00.
NEUT26|Is around this area right?
NEUT27|Here is where I want to buy it, but if it doesn't come down here then like say it started going higher then I will wait for it to go through this level.
NEUT28|And then come back and test is a support.
NEUT29|So basically like a resistance to support an if it goes I want to basically get in shares before it goes to $5757.
NEUT30|So I want to have my whole position before it gets to up to this level.
NEUT31|OK 'cause I want to hold a position and write it to higher highs 'cause I see this price going well over $7080.
NEUT32|OK that's more my exit price on the stock.
NEUT33|So this lower right here is really the key level you know.
NEUT34|Watch out for it.
NEUT35|If it breaks down then I'll give you guys some more key levels but just know my buying areas around that $45.00 mark is where I'll be buying heavy, but if it starts going up then I'll be buying as it breaks above this level and tested that support to start showing strength that it wants to go higher.
