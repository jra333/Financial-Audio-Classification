NEUT0|"""It's clearing this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price can stay up there above 272.
NEUT8|Fifty.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 272 fifty.
BULL10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would definitely be a great sign of power moving forward.
BULL11|Level of support after that.
NEUT12|Would just be where the twice today.
BULL13|Actually the berries try to press down through that level at two 6785, but you can see on both occasions right there the price did hold strong, so that would be another level of support.
NEUT14|But taking a step back and look at all this one more so the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT18|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very beneficial because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there I'm defining as quote unquote, the move.
NEUT19|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT20|As the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT21|How you must visualize that?
NEUT22|That is what he's been up against, and about two 7250 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|Nothing fancy or complicated here.
NEUT24|Party stop today several times, right up there at the $280 mark so you can see that right there are 280.
NEUT25|So if there is any sort of return back to the upside, that will certainly be Public Enemy number one.
NEUT26|But on all very nice way to start off the week.
NEUT27|Which is maybe the best news of everything is that it's only Monday, still four days left on the week.
NEUT28|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL34|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up.
