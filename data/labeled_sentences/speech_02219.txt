NEUT0|"""Did these numbers for December change anything in your view overall of the economy as we head deeper into 2021?"
BEAR1|Well, I think they confirmed that the that the high virus numbers and the renewed restrictions and in some places are clearly weighing on the labor market.
NEUT2|However, it's quite concentrated if you look at the composition, the.
BEAR3|All of the decline much more than all of the decline was in leisure and hospitality, excluding that we had about 350,000 new jobs in in positive territory.
NEUT4|So it's clearly in the sector that's most vulnerable to these restrictions and also to the winter weather.
NEUT5|So our expectation is that you know, right now we're going through a weaker.
NEUT6|In December in January, probably still in.
BULL7|February, I think things are going to be fairly sluggish, but then as we get into the spring, we're expecting very strong recovery on the back of better virus.
NEUT8|News increases and vaccination and fiscal stimulus.
NEUT9|Post the Georgia runoff.
BULL10|So we have a strongly above consensus view on growth in 2021, were at about 6 1/2% for US GDP growth.
NEUT11|And today's report doesn't change any of them, yeah?
NEUT12|But let's get to the the implications of the Democrats taking control of the Senate.
NEUT13|'cause you mentioned it, there is one of your reasons for that growth forecast.
NEUT14|What are your expectations in terms of?
NEUT15|New relief and aid to state and local municipalities.
NEUT16|You seem to expect that that is going to happen.
BULL17|You know we are expecting that, yes, so we think that on top of the $900 billion package that was passed recently will get about 750 billion in additional relief.
NEUT18|And that includes another round of payments of you know, rebates or checks.
BULL19|To the tune of $2000 a person for lower middle income earners in in total including the previous round.
BULL20|We do think there will be aid for state and local governments to the tune of maybe 200 billion or so and also some extended further extensions of extra unemployment benefit payments.
NEUT21|So it's it's another sizable package in in addition to fairly sizable package already takes the total.
NEUT22|To you know, 1.61 point, 7 trillion or so, and I think that it will be an important factor in in coming months.
