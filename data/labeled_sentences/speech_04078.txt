NEUT0|"""Alexander Forbes preference."
NEUT1|Share investments was incorporated in October 2006 following the bid by a private equity consortium to take Alexander Forbes Private.
NEUT2|The preference shares were a special purpose vehicle through which a certain existing shareholders could remain invested.
NEUT3|The preference shares in issue have a market cap of 2.3 billion and a current dividend yield of five point 1%.
NEUT4|Now you're going to have to take this away for just explain.
NEUT5|Well, Speaking of making about So what happened is a private equity consortium took.
BEAR6|Alexander Forbes off the market.
NEUT7|Alex Forbes basically a risk insurer, a insurance broker administrator of pension funds asset advisor.
NEUT8|They had things like Ginsburg costs in Milan that they kind of put in.
NEUT9|It's a big investment with an investment solutions also in there.
NEUT10|So now they want to delist it.
NEUT11|But some people said no, we don't like that.
NEUT12|We want to stay in so they created this thing.
NEUT13|You could then stick around but it is basically a press share.
NEUT14|It's not representative of the whole company.
NEUT15|It's represented a portion of it and they own some of the complex debt.
NEUT16|Issues that were instrumental to the whole delisting effort, so it's totally untransparent unless you know what's going on a with the business and be with the capital structure 'cause you know private equity deals that was put on a lot of debt and then the equity is the least of your worries.
BEAR17|The business itself has been battling.
NEUT18|It's under a new CEO.
NEUT19|They've had issues and other legislative challenges to do with blocking and bulking and all that sort of stuff they've sold certain of their businesses to global insurers, so there's sort of a twixt in between this thing trades very chunky Lee.
NEUT20|And I don't think it's really fit for private client consumption.
NEUT21|Charlotte, have you got anything to?
BEAR22|To add up, just add to that I think it's too illiquid as well and.
BEAR23|That dividend yield and and not enough clarity on what's going on in the company so that, I think is really hard or not.
NEUT24|It is not hot here.
NEUT25|Can I answer for you?
BEAR26|No, no, that's fine.
NEUT27|It's not, and I think that I get very issues that they're going to have going forward as well.
BEAR28|We've been sitting etc is going to hurt them probably as well.
NEUT29|Have one says not hot, you're going to the same room.
NEUT30|Well, we're going to be difficult to add one more thing to it is just down the road from our studios here.
NEUT31|Alex Forbes is building an enormous knew head office, an enormous and you know what they say about companies that build new hit officers does not do time to run 100 miles.
NEUT32|So there's that and all of the issues around their fees and where they are, and pension and changing regulatory environment.
NEUT33|"So I would say no, not hot."""
