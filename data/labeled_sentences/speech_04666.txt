BULL0|"""Hey guys Brendan here again from 123."
NEUT1|Learn to trade.com today is Friday April 23rd, 2010.
NEUT2|About 10:45 AM central time and I just went out in a really great position that we just had here.
NEUT3|It's actually something that I called out in real time on my blog so you could follow along with it there, but if you weren't here is a short video recap of the trade.
NEUT4|Alright guys, so we're taking a look at Amazon here.
NEUT5|That's what we have to trade on and basically what we had happen here.
BEAR6|As we can see on the five minute chart is price gap down after having a very strong rally yesterday, we had some earnings news come out and you can see price gap down and get down pretty far.
NEUT7|An extremely high volume.
NEUT8|So basically what we saw here is we took a look at the daily chart which was the next chart we should look at for support and resistance is we had nothing on the intraday chart.
NEUT9|And we saw this area right here from December 28th and 29th.
BULL10|And basically what happened is as price came down and we encountered that area, it responded extremely well to the very exact area and then rallied upward some.
BULL11|So I believe price actually made it as far up as maybe like $1.25 away from this area.
BULL12|So a very good trade.
BULL13|We didn't capitalize off all of that, but of course it was a very great position to have.
NEUT14|So this is one of the positions that I actually talked about in the price action course that we offer.
NEUT15|It's one of my basically one of my 8 trade setups that I utilized.
NEUT16|And there's a lot more to it than just price.
NEUT17|You know, hitting some area of support or resistance, but it's basically a very simple play to understand.
NEUT18|Once we really go into full depth and understand how it works.
NEUT19|So as an entry chart here as price ran down.
NEUT20|And came right into contact.
NEUT21|Actually with that same exact area which was looks like about one forty, 3:15 or so you can see price rallied all the way to like one 4420.
BULL22|So a very very quick and effective play.
BULL23|This all took place within a matter of 10 or 15 minutes and left us with some really nice profits.
NEUT24|So you guys have any questions about this trade?
NEUT25|Once again I do outline this exact type of scenario and more depth in the price action course.
