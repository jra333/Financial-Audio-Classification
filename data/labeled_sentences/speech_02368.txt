NEUT0|"""Hi this is Carla and this is a short analysis for Disney."
BULL1|Now starting off looking at the monthly timeframe we can see that price in the past has had a nice record for rising here.
NEUT2|Price was at this was in 2009.
NEUT3|Price was around $18.00 a share.
NEUT4|Went all the way up.
NEUT5|To be around $120.00 a share in August 2015.
BEAR6|Since then, prices just been going sideways and that's to be expected when we have a nice run like this, price will eventually be exhausted, angle sideways or in the opposite direction.
BEAR7|In this case, prices going sideways and he is wedged in between last year's high and last year's low, so we need price to 1st breakout.
NEUT8|I've of the high or the low before considering any trading opportunities.
NEUT9|Looking at the weekly timeframe now.
NEUT10|Price is above the 50 and 200 simple moving averages.
BEAR11|However, we can see clearly on the weekly time frame prices still going sideways.
BEAR12|And looking at the daily timeframe prices below the 50 and above the 200 simple moving average and again we can see that this is a messy looking chart and still going sideways.
BULL13|So just going back to the monthly timeframe because we are overall in an upward direction, we want to see a break out of this high and then that's when we will consider taking long opportunities.
NEUT14|As for now, we just need to stand aside and let price take the first action before we jump into any trade.
