BULL0|"""Tesla shares hitting yet another record high, also adding $8 billion to Elon Musk's personal fortune, vaulting him to number 5 on the Forbes world's Billionaires list."
BULL1|Tesla shares up nearly 32%.
NEUT2|Get this just in the last five trading sessions, and maybe that recent 5 for one stock split helping power those games.
BULL3|There is a growing number of electric vehicle startups going public in a nontraditional way, and this morning we are seeing yet another Phillip Bo joins us.
NEUT4|Right now he's got more on that story.
BULL5|Feel good morning.
NEUT6|Becky, good morning.
NEUT7|This was just announced within the last few minutes.
NEUT8|Canoe you may not be familiar with them, but they hope that you will be eventually with their electric vehicles.
NEUT9|It has announced it will be going public through a spec.
NEUT10|Here are the details of the deal.
NEUT11|It'll be through a merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. A blank check company, the value $2.4 billion.
NEUT12|It will be trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol CN, oh, $600 million will be the proceeds from this IPO that will fund the launch of the vehicles.
NEUT13|What is a canoe?
NEUT14|And that's the name of the first vehicle.
NEUT15|It's certainly different.
NEUT16|Looking to be sure it will go on sale in 2020.
NEUT17|2022, the CEO who we're going to hear from shortly calls this a loft on wheels also calls it a spaceship.
BULL18|Now they're hoping at canoe that they can replicate the success, or at least the investor demand for an EV spec related stock.
NEUT19|After it goes public, take a look at Nicola.
NEUT20|This is sort of the blueprint that these.
NEUT21|EV companies have been hoping to replicate when they go public, and that's Tesla that you're looking at there.
NEUT22|But if you looked at Nicola and you looked at what Nicola is over the last, you know.
NEUT23|Three months you would see that it is just exploded in value.
NEUT24|In there we go, there's Nicola and it pulled back a little bit.
NEUT25|But there is that big spike that you saw back in June when it went public.
NEUT26|By the way, we now have three EV specs that have been announced since Nicola went public.
NEUT27|"You've got Lordstown, Motors, Fisker, and now canoe."""
