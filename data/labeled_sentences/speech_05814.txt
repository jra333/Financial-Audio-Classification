BEAR0|"""I think that's a bigger problem for the United States mark market than greases."
BEAR1|And of course you know China has been economically speaking in the straits for some time now, and I think that's going to affect the global economy.
NEUT2|And it already has.
BEAR3|So I kind of think what's happening in the Chinese stock market could be a pretty warning for the rest of the global equity markets.
BEAR4|But Peter, are you saying that because of the massive declines in equity prices, that is going to have?
NEUT5|A knock on effect across the economy and then, of course impact the trade.
NEUT6|You know, linkages with the United States because a lot of people are saying that there hasn't been really that wealth effect created in China through the stock market.
NEUT7|No, it hasn't been.
NEUT8|You're right.
NEUT9|The real estate market really was the one that created the Walt effect, but again, you know if you have a stock market that's in a bear market territory and it's lost, what close to 3233% of its value without a bounce, that raises a question mark.
NEUT10|What is the Chinese economy all about?
NEUT11|What is it?
NEUT12|Where is it headed?
NEUT13|And I think that's the scary part.
NEUT14|So as a result are you?
NEUT15|Are you exposed to China at all?
BEAR16|Are you avoiding it as an investment destination?
NEUT17|Well, right now I'm not invested in China.
NEUT18|Absolutely not.
BEAR19|Again, you know, as I said, this has been worrying me for some time.
BEAR20|Hopefully I'm wrong, but I I kind of suspect that if this turmoil continues, look when you have the Chinese government doing everything possible to halt the decline that that raises a red flag.
NEUT21|As far as I'm concerned.
BEAR22|And so I'm I'm somewhat concerned and and I have been looking for a market correction.
NEUT23|So far the market correction has not really come to.
NEUT24|To fruition, and I suspect that you know what we've seen over the past several weeks, is basically just a minor pullback that's attached to China and the Greece Greece situation.
BEAR25|OK, Peter, so we've got you know, huge financial dislocation on the mainland.
BEAR26|We've got upsets in Europe with the Greek situation.
NEUT27|Does that mean that you as equities are a great place to be in to hide?
NEUT28|They will be.
BEAR29|They will be, but I do believe that that the Greek situation and probably the the Chinese situation is going to put some short term market pressure here.
BULL30|I think that it's just a matter of time before we break some Technical Support levels and when we do that, we're probably looking at a market that can still correct some 5 to 6%.
BULL31|At that point, I think it's a great entry point for global investors and the domestic investors as well.
BULL32|"To pick up a lot of cheap stock here in the United States."""
