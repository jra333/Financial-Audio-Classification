BULL0|"""Make the case for us Amazon up 70%."
NEUT1|I know that it's firing on many many cylinders, but how much room does it have to run?
BULL2|It has a good amount of room, so it's our our top large cap pic from the six year in a row.
BULL3|The traders worked well, shares up 40% on average annually the last five years.
BULL4|We think it will continue into next year.
BULL5|We raised our price target to 4350 a share that implies about 35% upside.
BULL6|From here the two key catalysts, strong revenue growth and margin expansion on the strong revenue growth.
BULL7|So we think Amazon will see further e-commerce market share gains as the focus on grocery in recent years really paid off during the.
BULL8|The pandemic and then our survey or survey data suggests a record 77 million US prime Subs in November that will drive sub revenue growth.
BULL9|And then we're also looking for strength and advertising and AWS and then on profitability next year were 30% above the street on OP income and that is driven by the high margin KWS improvising businesses, but they're also laughing over 10 billion in Kobe costs and lapping the 50% expansion in the fulfillment network so.
NEUT10|Deirdre to your point, a lot of levers here.
NEUT11|Lot of things working, and that's why Amazon remains our top deck.
NEUT12|Right and you mentioned groceries.
NEUT13|I just wonder how do you discern that sort of this is the home run for Amazon already.
NEUT14|There's some questions about this strategy, what it's doing with Whole Foods that perhaps it hasn't seen the same kind of gains as other grocers this year, is also another area that is going into health care.
NEUT15|In my view, neither of these are home runs yet, and it's not like everything Amazon does it successful.
NEUT16|And So what are you looking at in terms of those two?
NEUT17|Those two businesses?
NEUT18|Yeah, grocery and consumables are huge areas.
NEUT19|It's a it's a $1.3 trillion retail market in the US.
BULL20|From the data that we have that we're tracking online, grocery users doubled this year with the pandemic and we think it'll be a huge driver for ecommerce growth in the coming years.
NEUT21|And Amazon was really the key beneficiary and we think they will invest further further in grocery and then on the pharmacy side.
NEUT22|Like I said, like I said, 77 million prime Subs.
NEUT23|Our survey data suggests I think 60% would try the Amazon pharmacy, so we'll be tracking that closely.
BULL24|It is, I agree with you, Deirdre, it is kind of earlier on the pharmacy side, but that prime flywheel enables the company really to be able to enter a different retail in other verticals.
NEUT25|ANAN Pharmacy is one of them and it's it's a huge market.
NEUT26|Over $500 billion market.
NEUT27|Well, John.
BULL28|Congratulations on the streak with Amazon.
NEUT29|Picking that as your best idea.
NEUT30|Six years in a row.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
