NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol HGNC, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute."
NEUT1|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|Well, quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume an well above average volume on the day.
NEUT3|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT4|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance and I will be the first to admit a pretty confusing chart 'cause you gotta give credit where credits do Monster move.
BULL5|Very, very impressive.
NEUT6|Move all the way up there, but then all of a sudden the price closed all the way down there now does that mean the price totally crashed and went right back to where it started?
NEUT7|No, it didn't go right back to where it started, but I mean, was this a pretty big pullback?
NEUT8|Yeah, it absolutely was.
NEUT9|So I mean.
NEUT10|Is this a bullish or bearish chart moving forward?
NEUT11|You know in my mind, what makes the most sense is to use this level down here.
NEUT12|At the 12 cent mark.
NEUT13|And I'll change that to green to represent an area of support in this level is very helpful, and I'm not saying this is what's going to happen, but for you know, explanation, saying, let's say the price comes down here to 12 and then just breaks down below it.
NEUT14|At that point, what would you have?
NEUT15|You would have the price having gone right back to where it was inside of this range of the chart and price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything of that nature.
NEUT16|But to be fair, no price can just go straight up anyways.
NEUT17|As nice as nice as that would be.
NEUT18|So let's say the price comes down here.
NEUT19|Behaves in that manner.
NEUT20|Then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now all of a sudden what would you have?
NEUT22|Well, at least in this situation you'd have a set of those right there.
NEUT23|You have loads down there, and if you envision those steps you still have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And that's what it truly strong moves going to.
BULL25|It's going to make progress and again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $0.12.
NEUT26|So really, that area is kind of a dictionary.
NEUT27|It's helping us define whether or not the price is quote unquote, going back to where it was, that being associated with bearishness.
NEUT28|Or is the price quote unquote?
NEUT29|Making progress that being associated with bullishness?
NEUT30|So keep an eye on the 12 cent mark.
NEUT31|Unless the other price behaves with it moving forward.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
NEUT42|Totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT43|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT44|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
