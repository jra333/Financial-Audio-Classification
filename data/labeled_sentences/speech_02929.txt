NEUT0|"""Good afternoon after hours 1:26 PM Facebook as we showed in the very first video of what people thought they loved about those earnings and we covered it."
NEUT1|But look at what happened like we always say there was more to the story.
BEAR2|This is an all time low in Facebook.
NEUT3|Now This is why we told everybody that Facebook needs to be bought from day one right around 18 and a half dollars is where I like it for myself.
NEUT4|About pretty greedy about my stock prices.
NEUT5|Because what I need to do is find out more about the revenues.
NEUT6|Am forward looking.
NEUT7|Is where these multiples are going to be bid up by the bigger Wall Street houses?
NEUT8|So what I would like to show the MMT's is from $29.00 down here to 2450 and this is Facebook printing all time lows here and now and after hours once again will have a big discussion.
NEUT9|Over the weekend.
NEUT10|Is what will have.
NEUT11|About Facebook, but once again the people that bought this up there around $38.37 dollars $35 and analysts were putting these big buy ratings on somewhere somewhere.
NEUT12|But you had people that were talking a lot about why Facebook would have to go higher.
NEUT13|While yeah, maybe it'll go higher one day, but it's not going to be today.
NEUT14|And we're going to find out more 52 week lows after hours printing on Facebook with an after hours live print chart right here and now.
NEUT15|And this video along with my live MMT.
NEUT16|So actually in here battling out what the trades is that we will have this first quarterly report and how the stock acted on its first time around in the middle of a major economic slowdown.
NEUT17|OK, and this is what the IPO price.
NEUT18|You know, that really pricey sings higher.
NEUT19|We're not going to talk about that right now.
NEUT20|We're going to talk about that.
BEAR21|You're making all time lows in Facebook.
BEAR22|OK, and here was low.
NEUT23|Right there and we just came right up here a little bit and it'll have its trading ranges like anything.
NEUT24|But what we wanna know more about clearly?
NEUT25|Is the actual?
NEUT26|"Earnings guidance, where are they pulling that revenue from?"""
