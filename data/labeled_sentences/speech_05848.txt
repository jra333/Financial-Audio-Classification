NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris."
BEAR1|Take a look at the S&P 500 and you can see that we have formed a negative candle to kick off the week.
BEAR2|The 50 day Ma causes a bit of resistance, just as the 50%.
NEUT3|Feb is right there as well.
NEUT4|2800 of course offers a.
BULL5|Significant amount of psychological resistance.
NEUT6|So at this point.
NEUT7|I think the question is can we breakthrough this 2640 level?
NEUT8|If we do, then the market is to go down to the 2500 level.
NEUT9|There's a gap up here at the 29 fifty 2960 level at the 61.8, so if we break above the top of the candle stick, that's our destination right at the 200 day Ma.
BULL10|I do not think we go much higher than that on a rally.
NEUT11|Otherwise we are either going to pull back to 2640 or.
NEUT12|"To 2500"""
