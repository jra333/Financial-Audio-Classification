NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this technical analysis video for Tuesday, May 19th and Christina Bertha, new investment analyst, exam.com."
NEUT1|Taking a look at pound dollar on the four hour chart.
BEAR2|So when you look at the chart pound dollar completed bearish double top formation last week, breaking below the one point 2246 neckline in reaching a new low at one point 2074 this week, however, we can see that the market is on the bullish side trying to recover back above the one point 2246 border.
BULL3|A move that could make the double top formation invalid and therefore eliminate the risk of a downtrending market.
BULL4|All the positive momentum in the RSI, and the fact that the Stochastics had yet to confirm overbought conditions, such as that more games could follow.
BULL5|However, technically for that to happen I would like to see a close above the one point 2246 neckline and more importantly to see a rally above the 50.
NEUT6|Moving average which could potentially take us towards the 200 day moving average.
NEUT7|And the one point 2430 barrier moving higher we could reach is the double top zone around one point 2645.
NEUT8|If the one point 2520 resistance level proofs easy to get through while above one point 2645 for the next stop could be somewhere near one point 2760.
NEUT9|I know the price was to pull back below her the neckline.
NEUT10|The 20.
BULL11|Moving average currently meeting the 38.2% hibachi retracement of the applet from the 35 year low of one point.
NEUT12|1409.
NEUT13|How this is at one point, 2180 should reject outside corrections to keep the market sentiment positive even out then attention will turn back to the one point 2074 level, a break of which could trigger and you selling.
NEUT14|Probably until one point 1975.
NEUT15|How I lower the market may heat new bottoms around the 61.8% Fibonacci of one point 1880.
NEUT16|So that's all from me.
BULL17|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
