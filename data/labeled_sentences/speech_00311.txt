NEUT0|"""It's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol RIOT."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link will be in the state the obvious but I will anyways to establish context here but very very impressive.
NEUT4|Move on the day when you think about the fact that the price gap down all the way there and is now battled back up to where it has good solid move.
BULL5|Now yes, of course there's more work that needs to be done, but point being from where the price was towards able to battle back up to nice move.
NEUT6|But that does little the valid question of but is there any sort of true power behind this president?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT8|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead cap on site move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward in my mind.
NEUT11|It all revolves around this area right here.
NEUT12|At 4275, Why is 4275 important?
NEUT13|I'm not saying that this is what's going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT14|If the price were to come down to that level, behave in that manner and then continue on down.
NEUT15|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT16|That would quite literally be put in the price.
NEUT17|Right back inside of that range where it just wasn't, I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sign a true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT18|But I mean to be fair at no price.
NEUT19|Just go straight up either.
NEUT20|So maybe the price does come down here the difference being behaved in that manner before certain works way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there, you would have those lows down there.
NEUT22|And if you envision each one of those as stair steps, well there you go.
NEUT23|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
BULL24|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT25|And in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined.
NEUT26|As 4275 as far as areas of resistance are concerned, moving forward, keep an eye on that purple line up there, which on my chart denotes the very one on the very famous 50.
NEUT27|Moving average, and that's currently valid.
NEUT28|It let's just call it right up there around the $51.00 mark, give or take a little bit, but that will be the next overall battleground.
BULL29|But overall very impressive bounds today.
NEUT30|Not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum?
NEUT31|Moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT34|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR38|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT41|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT44|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT45|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT46|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT47|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
