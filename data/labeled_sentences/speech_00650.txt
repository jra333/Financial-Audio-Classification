NEUT1|Sundial.

BULL11|It really helps the channel grow alright guys.
NEUT12|So today we're going to be talking about sundial growers.
NEUT13|Ticker symbol SMDL.
NEUT14|I'm sure you guys have all heard about this stock at this point.
NEUT15|It is a very good stock to hold for the future, especially with the president like Joe Biden being in office in the USA.
NEUT16|In my opinion.
BULL17|I really love son al growers and I think that they are an amazing company.
NEUT18|Obviously there are websites like The Motley Fool which.
NEUT19|They should stick to their website, you know address name www.fool.com because these guys are a bunch of fools.
NEUT20|Guys make no mistake, people like The Motley Fool do not have your best interest in mind.
NEUT21|They want to see people sell off stock so they can buy in because they see potential for that stuff.
NEUT22|If you look at old Motley Fool articles, they will say things like, oh, I'm not buying Tesla stock still, or why you shouldn't buy Tesla stock or Tesla.
BEAR23|Stock price is too high.
NEUT24|That was from like 8 to 12 months ago.
NEUT25|Now look at where Tesla is at.
NEUT26|So seriously, do not listen to these guys.
NEUT27|They do not have your best interest at hand.
BULL28|I think that they are a great company because they are absolutely going to be one of the futures of the interesting herb.
NEUT29|That interesting green herb industry, if you know what I'm saying, they have a very attractive and nice to use website.
NEUT30|Their products absolutely look amazing from an aesthetic appeal.
NEUT31|I am very in love with this company.
NEUT32|This company is one of my favorites.
NEUT33|Of course, analysts like The Motley Fool do not want this company to succeed or succeed in the short term because they don't want to get in at a high and it's working right now.
BEAR34|Sundale growers is down.
NEUT35|I think 1520%.
BEAR36|I can't exactly remember exactly what it was, but yeah, it's down 15 to 20% right now.
NEUT37|But again, guys do not sell.
NEUT38|Do not let these analysts win.
NEUT39|OK, but I'm not a financial advisor, so please do your own due diligence and research.
NEUT40|Before you listen to my advice, but in my opinion I would not sell.
NEUT41|Obviously other companies like ACB and Canopy Growth which are just as good in companies that I think people should also invest in.
BULL42|But this company is a startup that is going to absolutely skyrocket and I see this company hitting five to $10 within the next couple of years, especially if Joe Biden does what he says he's going to do and make this interesting herb legal.
BEAR43|Please guys do not sleep on this one because someone like Motley Fool says that it's going to be a bad idea to invest in it.
NEUT44|Motley Fool is trying to scam people.
NEUT45|I don't know if you've ever seen those ads on YouTube, but yeah, they're trying to scam people.
NEUT46|Please do not listen to these guys.
NEUT47|I definitely don't see the stock going on a crazy run up like GameStop or anything.
BULL48|It's already had someone over run up, but I think it's starting to somewhat die down, but it's going to be a very nice long term investment anyway.
NEUT49|Guys, I'd love to know what you guys think about this in the comments section below.
NEUT50|Do you guys think this stock is going to explode or do you think of this stock is dead?
NEUT51|I would love to know what you guys think about it in the comments section below.
BULL52|I hope you guys have a great rest your day.
