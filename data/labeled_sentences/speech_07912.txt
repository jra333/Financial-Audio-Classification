NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Katrina and I'm the social media manager here at The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|We're here to answer your investing questions and I've got a batch in from Facebook and Twitter.
NEUT2|I'm going to send them down to our analysts who answer them with their foolish opinions.
NEUT3|Here's a question from Guy on Twitter.
NEUT4|What investments should 20 somethings be making who don't have student loans?
NEUT5|So what does a 20 year old with no college debt do with their money?
NEUT6|You of course want to make sure you're paying off all your high interest debt.
NEUT7|If you have any credit card debt and you want to establish an emergency fund, and then because of your long time horizon, you've got 40 years till retirement or thereabouts.
NEUT8|You want to be heavily weighted in the stock market versus say, bonds.
NEUT9|With that money you want to make sure that you've got at least a five year time horizon.
NEUT10|You don't want to be dipping back into the money if you're in the stock market because it is so volatile and you don't know where it's going to be in the next five years.
NEUT11|But over the long term stock should be going up an, so there are two ways to really approach the stock market if that's where you want to be, and there's a easy way in the more difficult way.
NEUT12|The easy way is to purchase index funds and ETF's.
NEUT13|There's no shame in this.
NEUT14|You'll track the market an.
NEUT15|You know The Dirty little secret is most investors don't beat the market and I think everyone should be weighted at the core of their portfolio.
NEUT16|Even if they pick individual stocks in these index mutual funds and ETF's, I think Vanguard's the best provider of those.
NEUT17|They're very low cost and very shareholder friendly.
NEUT18|Now, if you want to buy individual stocks in at least part of your portfolio, well, I think you've come to the right place.
NEUT19|At full com, we hope you come to our site and read up about individual stocks.
