NEUT0|"""Today we're going to talk about the spanker with your SPL K and from first year it looks really strange, really."
NEUT1|Big market cap, oh, $2.2 billion in sales and income, minus $800 million.
NEUT2|Interesting, I read all of the reports and all of the presentations and there absolutely boring all they have to know it is as they have two segments.
NEUT3|It is a cloud segment and platform segment and platform segment.
NEUT4|It is just the data analysis so tool for big companies and here you can see the customers.
NEUT5|It is Zoom Slack, NASDAQ, Airbus.
NEUT6|Salesforce, Google, Chevron, BMW, T-Mobile, Blizzard.
BEAR7|I think everything will be OK with this talk, but if we will see another bad earnings report they can fall down a little bit more.
NEUT8|And if we will see something like 120 on another pull down and it can be really interesting.
NEUT9|.2 enter into the stalker.
NEUT10|Because in 90% of our cases it is not really interesting cut too close.
BEAR11|Companies like as this one, but I don't really like it because they moved from software business to cloud business and you can see how the margin fall down from 90% in 2012 to 76% in 2020.
NEUT12|Also we can see how they consistently.
BEAR13|Lose money and now it is unreal.
NEUT14|UN minus $677 million.
BEAR15|LGM and they had they lose their shares from 95 million shares to 160,000,000 shares and not really comfortable for investors for my point of view here you can see 4K areas.
NEUT16|It is DevOps compliance and security ID operations and platform.
NEUT17|With $81 billion, but in this segment, as they have unreal amount of competition like Apple, Amazon, Google, Alibaba and as a big guy.
NEUT18|So for me it is not interesting to gamble right now because they can go up or down.
NEUT19|It is not interesting.
NEUT20|Create now I will wait.
NEUT21|A better price is maybe 120.
NEUT22|Please write down your thoughts about us.
BEAR23|Klunker maybe I missed something and it is a super.
BULL24|Great stock, thank you for watching.
NEUT25|"Bye bye."""
