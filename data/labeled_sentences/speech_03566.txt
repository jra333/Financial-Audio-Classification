BULL0|"""Hey guys today let's take a look at Google both Wednesday and Thursday did pretty well."
BEAR1|However, on Friday it slumped.
NEUT2|Can we expect this going forward into next week?
NEUT3|Let's take a look.
NEUT4|Here you can see the chart of Google.
BULL5|As you can see, both Wednesday and Thursday had big moves up at the open.
BEAR6|However, on Friday we had a big move down and it kind of slumped for the rest of the day.
BULL7|At the end of Wednesday, we could see it broke through its 200 day moving average and then did moved up quite above that the next day.
NEUT8|As you know, the moving averages act as support and resistance the same way as the price levels do.
BULL9|And so we can see that going forward, it actually kind of consolidated around here before it moved up.
NEUT10|We could probably see the same thing too, as it's dipping down.
NEUT11|Potentially that will consolidate around the same price level as the 200 day moving average.
NEUT12|So that's one point also to consider.
NEUT13|Let's actually post out.
NEUT14|The price supports and resistances.
NEUT15|Here's the key one.
BEAR16|Obviously the low.
NEUT17|And we can say the high also here at the.
NEUT18|1586 over the jump.
NEUT19|Too fast into this one, so this one say support here.
NEUT20|Well that one's still resistance.
NEUT21|You can see the resistance here at this point.
NEUT22|Kind of lines up with all these points here.
NEUT23|Out there.
BULL24|We get support here.
NEUT25|But here.
NEUT26|There we go.
NEUT27|So as we see.
BULL28|We should see this as a support.
BULL29|This 200A moving average, so potentially we'll see a curl, or at least some kind of consolidation around when this approach is closer to this 200 day moving average.
NEUT30|Or potentially it will break through it and then at that point it will become resistance again for the stock.
BULL31|So hopefully after the couple days of downtrend that we could see an uptrend on Monday.
NEUT32|But we'll have to see.
NEUT33|Good luck.
