NEUT0|"""Say welcome to the B&B."
NEUT1|TCG investing.
BULL2|We got this amazing work and we got this amazing cards today.
NEUT3|We're gonna be talking about Pokémon TCG investing versus Yugioh TCG investing.
NEUT4|I'm just going to give out my personal opinion.
NEUT5|The statistic if you want deep a deep analysis in both DC investing you will see we can also make such videos will make them in the future so we can understand deeply and fundamentally which credit card is more potent than the other.
NEUT6|Which one is more profitable than the other?
NEUT7|So right now we have solemn judgment, ultimate rare, we have Pokémon, and these two columns fell down.
NEUT8|We love them so we will put them back on their place.
BEAR9|Sorry, sorry, sorry, forgive me.
NEUT10|This charger worth run one point 2K and this is worth around 140 Canadian dollars.
BULL11|Let's say run 105 USD an amazing investment.
NEUT12|I bought these at 80 Canadian dollars and about this at 300 Canadian dollars so you can see the difference between both and I. I chose this example purposefully.
NEUT13|Star is iconic.
NEUT14|It is worth much more.
NEUT15|Solemn judgment is iconic is worth much less.
NEUT16|They both came out around the same time this came around.
NEUT17|This came on around the 1999 and this this OG made charger came around 1999.
NEUT18|Two this was released in Metal Raider, I believe so, and this was released in base set.
NEUT19|Whatever the first generation of Pokémon, this is a shiny one you can see is black and we do not discriminate against black jars or we actually love those black shattered.
NEUT20|They are back and this guy is a white unfortunately.
NEUT21|My solemn guy is a white unfortunate there's no black following guide.
NEUT22|There's no shiny solo, but he's all the merrier and that's what we love.
NEUT23|So that's what I'm my point across is not this is going to be not a very heavily detailed oriented video like we usually do with statistics and everything.
NEUT24|Pokémon TCG has much more.
NEUT25|How do you see it?
NEUT26|Much more reach how Pokémon Red is a seven most sold game you go does not have that a lot of the demand for discard is higher than the demand for these cards.
NEUT27|I don't want to damage them, give them back to their place because I love these cards and they do make me money and that's what we want.
NEUT28|We want to make money so so you understand the iconic next behind Pokémon is still relevant because Pokémon Sun and Moon on the 3DS has around 30 million copies sold rather than you go, you go as they made games, but they don't sell.
NEUT29|They don't sell that much.
NEUT30|That creating card of Yugioh is much more popular.
NEUT31|Not start off with the first bearish point of this trading card game is there are no.
NEUT32|There are none man.
NEUT33|Everything is perfect.
NEUT34|They always go up in price, never cycled on praise.
BULL35|The average is 82%.
NEUT36|That's why we bought 12345.
NEUT37|So many time judgments.
NEUT38|Burger.
NEUT39|"Soup"""
