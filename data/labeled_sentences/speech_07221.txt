NEUT0|"""Take a look at this chart."
BEAR1|It's the S&P 500 on Wednesday, March 18th, when the index plunged more than 7%, triggering something called a circuit breaker.
BEAR2|You can see it right here at 12:56 PM, trading was halted for a full 15 minutes.
BEAR3|It was the 4th Circuit breaker in less than two weeks as markets went haywire on fears that the Corona virus would cause a global economic meltdown.
BEAR4|Circuit Breakers halted trading on March 9th, 12th and 16th as well.
BEAR5|Circuit Breakers were created to mitigate crashes, but some traders say they are ineffective and in fact they may serve to make a bad day.
NEUT6|Even worse will explain, but first here's how they work.
NEUT7|Circuit Breakers were created in the aftermath of a 1987 stock market crash known as Black Monday on October 19th, 1987.
BEAR8|We had a big crash where the Dow Jones fell approximately 25% during the day and it was a mess.
BEAR9|The printers were jamming in the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
BEAR10|It couldn't print the order tickets fast enough.
NEUT11|Nobody really knew what their position was.
BEAR12|They realized the market could not handle the volume.
NEUT13|The purpose of circuit Breakers.
BULL14|Was some markets could handle the increase in trading that happened during sudden major downswings.
NEUT15|Circuit Breaker is a stop in trading.
BEAR16|The idea behind the circuit breaker is that something's gone wrong, so you need time to assess the problem and think about the impact when the S&P 500 drops 7% from the previous close, a message goes out announcing the trading halt.
NEUT17|At this moment all the exchanges will stop accepting new words under current rules.
NEUT18|There are three levels of circuit Breakers there triggered.
BEAR19|If the SNP dropped seven percent, 13% and 20% in a single session before last week, the lowest circuit breaker, which was then at 10%, had only been tripped once.
NEUT20|The Level 2 and level three circuit Breakers have never been triggered, and October 27, 1997.
BEAR21|The Asian financial crisis hit the United States.
BEAR22|The Hong Kong market had crashed the night before and the route hit New York, so that was the only time the old 10% market wide circuit breaker was triggered.
NEUT23|On May 6, 2010, the Flash crash happened.
BEAR24|This was a very strange event where the Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 1000 points.
NEUT25|Around 9.2% of the time, and then bounced back just as quickly for reasons that are still a matter of debate.
NEUT26|In response, the SEC changed the percentage move required for a circuit breaker to trigger from 10% to 7%.
NEUT27|The SEC also switched the index that would determine the circuit breaker up until that point it had been the Dow Jones industrial average, not the S&P 500.
BEAR28|But some traders questioned the value of halting the stock market even during a crash.
NEUT29|Proponents of circuit Breakers say they do, with their method.
NEUT30|Do they give people a chance to breathe and pause and think about what's happening in the market so they can come back in and maybe buy something to sell it?
BEAR31|Critics of circuit Breakers say that sometimes they actually exacerbate volatility in Excel.
NEUT32|Office works.
NEUT33|The reason for that is because you could have investors who see that we're getting close to circuit breaker levels, and they sell immediately because they're worried about getting caught in the circuit breaker.
BEAR34|Not being able to exit their position.
BEAR35|You know we're definitely in a situation that most of us have not seen before and we don't know what's going to happen.
NEUT36|Circuit Breakers are a sign of extreme times.
BEAR37|"As long as the coronavirus continues to frankly kill people and cause a very sharp economic slowdown, I want to surprise them or circuit Breakers happen."""
