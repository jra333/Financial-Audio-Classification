BULL0|"""Take a Coca Cola has entered exclusive talks to pick up a significant stake in country's largest coffee chain."
BULL1|That's Cafe Coffee Day as the soft drinks giant is looking to gain a foothold in the rapidly growing cafe space.
NEUT2|Right now, bution from The Economic Times joins in with exclusive details right now.
NEUT3|Hi, good morning just woke aside is actually how this deal is likely to be structure and what exactly is cocaine?
NEUT4|So Cook wants to pick up around 50% stake in Cafe Coffee Day.
NEUT5|Now the negotiations are at early stages.
NEUT6|Atlanta is driving this while last year Coca Cola had bought, bought out Costa Coffee in India.
NEUT7|Costa Coffee is very small.
NEUT8|They have less than 50 stores and Cafe Coffee Day has 17125 stores.
BEAR9|So that's why Coke wants to really scale up and the cost ideal would not sign out well for it in India and Becaused offering sales are slowing down.
NEUT10|We are looking at the coffee cafe business in a significant way.
NEUT11|So right now I would imagine that the transaction may happen at the coffee chain level because CCD enterprise has a lot of other businesses and I'm sure Coke is not interested in buying a company which has infrastructure or report, or for that matter an investment company in it.
NEUT12|Absolutely, they want to leverage those 18 are close to 1800s, Cafe Coffee Day outlets so that they can use those as are captive channel to sell their products as as well as the entire ready to drink and ready to make.
NEUT13|Coffee in their fold, which would give them intrumental.
NEUT14|Reach in in the beverage space.
BULL15|Simply trying to reduce their dependence on the carbonated beverage category upgrade story.
BULL16|Thank you for joining us.
NEUT17|That could be a stock which could be in demand to data global beverages.
NEUT18|Also there trying to reboot themselves their merger, that order food businesses in two topic Global.
BEAR19|And now we understand that's again a story which we picked up that there could be a change of guard now, Interestingly on Monday or Bus came that voluntary may be moving out of Britannia.
NEUT20|He may be joining Tata Global Beverages Britannia.
NEUT21|Yesterday's denied that we broke that story and then Britannia yesterday.
NEUT22|Denied it completely and then the statement also went to the exchanges, but Tata Global Beverages is in a.
NEUT23|Process of rebooting itself.
NEUT24|Will that reboot change the contours of Tata Global Beverages Samir a quick yes or no on this one.
NEUT25|This data.
NEUT26|Global beverages has been more like a sleepy stock.
NEUT27|I've called this company as the company, which is a confused company because they want global business, local business grade brands.
NEUT28|But those brands don't give them enough ROI.
NEUT29|I think today the management of Tata Sons is clearly looking at consumer facing businesses in a very different light.
BULL30|They're wanting to invest in them, so I think it makes for good tidings for Tata Global as a company.
NEUT31|But clearly the man at the top makes a lot of difference.
NEUT32|So the change of guards needs to be watched and then seen.
NEUT33|What is the strategy that involves just given that nothing has worked for them so far?
NEUT34|"They've been struggling to really focus on that available beverages for a while, but let's see what comes out of that."""
