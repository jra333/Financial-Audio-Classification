NEUT0|"""As we talk about Apple, the chart doesn't look compelling, but there's gotta be a case to be made one way or the other, or maybe not at all, right?"
NEUT1|Maybe not at all.
NEUT2|You know, I think Apple's lost its identity and that and that's our real thesis on the name, what used to be a growth stock grew revenues at 66% in 2011, Juggernaut 45% 2012.
NEUT3|Now projections are 15%.
NEUT4|So wait, you know, down to Earth down into the stratosphere, competitive threat from Samsung Israel, they released their Galaxy S4 last week.
NEUT5|This is a feature rich phone software.
BEAR6|Hardware is all impressive, so Apple is losing some of its product leadership to Samsung at the same time.
BEAR7|Apple's got a question whether it wants to target the middle income consumer consumer exactly and if it does so, how many people are going to switch from the high end phones to the middle end phones and therefore hurt Apple's margins in the process.
NEUT8|Let's talk about targeting because it's not just about consumers, it's also about the investors as well.
NEUT9|Apple and not a growth stock, not a value.
NEUT10|Stock, right?
NEUT11|Stuck somewhere in Limbo right now?
NEUT12|What exactly would a perceived possible again possible?
NEUT13|Dividend increase mean for the stock?
BULL14|Well, it didn't increase would be an obvious positive, but it then it sort of transforms the image of Apple's as a growth juggernaut.
NEUT15|Does it want to be a value stock?
NEUT16|Does it want to continue to trade at 10 times earnings as it is now increased its dividend?
BEAR17|Or does it want to invest in product and in growth so it sounds to me like you're saying Apple is struggling with identity one way or the other.
NEUT18|That to me suggests it's going to be stuck in Limbo for awhile from a stock perspective as well.
NEUT19|What's your options?
NEUT20|Play on that's right.
NEUT21|So with that thesis in mind that Apple is stuck in the middle somewhere.
NEUT22|We like selling options.
NEUT23|In general.
NEUT24|We think a well devised strangle sale something out to June maybe 10% out of the money options now.
NEUT25|Great way to play.
NEUT26|Also a strangle again is selling a put and call selling a strangle selling it.
NEUT27|Put in the call at the same time you're collecting premium and what you're hoping for is that the stock does not become volatile.
NEUT28|It stays within that band.
NEUT29|What's your what's your strangle threshold here?
NEUT30|That you see the three 75525?
NEUT31|That's right.
NEUT32|So with Apple around 450 bucks a share right here.
NEUT33|We'd go about 75 bucks out of the money in either direction.
NEUT34|Sell a 520-5375.
NEUT35|Strangle your collecting about 11 bucks so you're collecting about 2 1/2 percent yield on a 3 month trade.
BULL36|Give yourself 19% cushion room in either direction and we really don't see Apple breaking out that much in either direction.
NEUT37|So I gotta plan so your your ultimate hope here is that between now and June the stock doesn't move either 20% in either direction one way or the other.
BULL38|"We're banking on perfect."""
