NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome back to the note and it's not exactly time for panic, but it is time to get just a little concerned this."
BEAR1|As you can see is what world stocks have been doing and today has been the worst day since we hit bottom back in February.
BEAR2|The S&P 500 here in the states was down just over 1% stocks in the rest of the world, particularly Europe did somewhat worse than that.
NEUT3|And if you want to build a case that we are heading into yet a third.
BEAR4|Big wave of risk off sentiment.
NEUT5|There are quite a number of other indicators out there to support you.
NEUT6|Perhaps most importantly, let's take a look at bank stocks.
NEUT7|Banks tends to be the necessary leaders of stock market rallies.
BEAR8|It's difficult for markets to go forward strongly if financials are weak.
NEUT9|As you can see here, we're looking at the KBW index of large U.S. banks.
NEUT10|The Footsie Euro first index of large European banks, plus Deutsche Bank, which as you remember was very much at the heart of the scare we had back in February.
BEAR11|And you can see that in all cases they are turning distinctly back downwards again, at present that is plainly a sign that some concern is back out there about growth.
NEUT12|If you want another classic sign of concern, take a look at the yen.
BULL13|The yen is regarded as a safe haven.
NEUT14|It tends to strengthen when people are nervous and people look for the safety of Japan.
BULL15|And as you can see, it's now at its strongest level in almost 18 months at the kind of level where it might provoke a response from the government and from the central bank.
BEAR16|This may be too strong for Japanese comfort, and it's certainly too strong for jet.
BULL17|The Japanese stock markets comfort.
BEAR18|The Japanese had a bad day today.
NEUT19|Now there are other measures I could have thrown in.
BEAR20|Bond yields are falling the shape of the yield curve.
BEAR21|We're seeing a flattening of the yield curve are another worrying sign and the oil price had a very bad start today.
BULL22|Although inventory numbers for the US showing a reduction in inventories did help the WTI contract recover quite strongly into the close of the day.
NEUT23|All taken together, certainly no clear evidence yet that we really are going to have a repeat of the two big risk off waves we've already had since last summer.
NEUT24|But reason for concern if you want to.
NEUT25|Gauge whether we really are heading in that direction.
NEUT26|"Take a look at some of the indicators I've taken you through."""
