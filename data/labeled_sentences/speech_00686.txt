NEUT0|"""Welcome back guys to a brand new video and today I'm going over Tesla."
NEUT1|My favorite stock ever or company.
NEUT2|I should say Elon Musk.
NEUT3|Elon is ducky.
NEUT4|Trust me when I say this.
NEUT5|He would make your mind blown if you want Tesla honestly just invested into this company order for a few years and then use that money towards your Tesla if that's what you want to be doing.
NEUT6|For my case I would just reinvested but before I get straight into this video, please smash that subscribe button as well with the like button.
NEUT7|Alright, let's get straight to it.
BULL8|If you look at the charge, Tesla has been on its all time high.
NEUT9|I will leave.
NEUT10|It's going to be going to at least 6 to $700.00.
BEAR11|If we don't see another market crash for the EV industry just because.
NEUT12|Tesla is being added into the S&P 500 now when they get included two into the S&P 500.
NEUT13|Now people who are invested into this in 500 now they have to buy Tesla.
NEUT14|And of course once they get added into the S&P 500.
BEAR15|Oh my word, this is going to skyrocket.
BULL16|I mean, it already skyrocketed when they got announced that they're going to be added into there on December 21st, which is an amazing news for Tesla to be added into the S&P 500.
BEAR17|You should be excited if you're a long term Holder for Tesla, but other than that I do believe that if the NEO and expand do continue to fall and all these other EV companies.
NEUT18|They're gonna bring down Tesla in my opinion.
NEUT19|It's not even that it's as well with CIC.
BEAR20|Nikolaki will screw legal GM.
BEAR21|All these other car companies are going to be going downhill on a downtrend which is not good.
BEAR22|Not good at all.
BULL23|In the end, I think this month is going to be amazing for the EV industry just because we do have few news coming out.
NEUT24|I mean Tesla is getting added into this 500 SP is also getting a merger with Chargepoint.
BULL25|That's going to build the hype on December 15th.
NEUT26|But listen, listen.
NEUT27|I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT28|OK, so don't use what I say against me 'cause I'm just doing this for fun.
NEUT29|Yes little, I am currently invested into SBE switch back energy.
NEUT30|On top of that, Tesla.
NEUT31|Why 'cause I think Evie is going to be the future, but do I see that this bubble is going to pop soon?
NEUT32|Yes I do, but I feel like in December.
NEUT33|5th to December.
NEUT34|Like 15th.
BULL35|I do see the EV industry going back up.
BEAR36|Rebounding, but I do as well see that they're going to be having a massive fall.
BEAR37|A massive fall after switch back energy gets closer to the merger date.
NEUT38|It's going to build that hype and then once they reversed their merge I'm.
BEAR39|I'm going to assume that they're going to drop by a lot, 'cause a lot of people are going to be taking the profits.
NEUT40|And not even a book that if you look at the other spots when they merged, they fall hard like massively.
NEUT41|Look at fisker.
BEAR42|They were at like 1615 bucks before merge and then right after they fell all the way to $9.
NEUT43|Hopefully we can see the same thing for SBE, 'cause if that's the case, I'm going to buy heavily.
BULL44|Anyways, I hope you guys enjoy that quick video.
