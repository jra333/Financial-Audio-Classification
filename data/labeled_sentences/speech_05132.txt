NEUT0|"""Everyone taking a look at Netflix, I had some Netflix at 5050 something but I sold it out when I got a small small little bump."
BULL1|I don't know where I sold it, but I definitely missed the big increase.
NEUT2|So I think I'm not alone, and then I think a lot of people were expecting Netflix to continue.
NEUT3|No, do average.
BULL4|But Netflix has done better than what we expected, so Netflix is $169.12 right now.
BULL5|Went up $7.00.
NEUT6|Did any of you guys buy cheap and make all this money?
NEUT7|'cause I wish I would have.
NEUT8|But yeah, that'll happen sometimes when you.
BULL9|Are willing to take a shot even though you know that eventually it will go up.
NEUT10|I always assume new up com.
NEUT11|I I didn't.
BULL12|I don't know if I thought it was going to go up this high, but I knew it was going to go back up just because Netflix.
NEUT13|Same thing with Facebook.
NEUT14|Like everybody's got Netflix basically.
NEUT15|Now everyone I know does and everyone's got Facebook.
NEUT16|So obviously Facebook has way more users, but Netflix is right, really, you know.
NEUT17|It's a big piece of a lot of people's lives, and that that makes it very valuable and pure ratio.
NEUT18|Might say that's not a bad, not a good bet, but this is this is not one of the ones you look at the P ratio because.
NEUT19|You know, like this LinkedIn 3D.
NEUT20|These are all you know.
NEUT21|Things that are speculation basis is actually a better investment when you look at P ratio, but.
NEUT22|Netflix right now if you guys got in early, you're good to go.
NEUT23|"Are you holding or are you selling what you doing?"""
