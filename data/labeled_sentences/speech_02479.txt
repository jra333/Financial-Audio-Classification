BULL0|"""We have a bullish call."
BULL1|As I said on Disney today, got upgraded at Deutsche Bank to buy from hold as they go all in on streaming.
NEUT2|That's how the bank characterizes the call.
NEUT3|Sarath, you own it.
NEUT4|They take the price target to 163 from 128.
NEUT5|Not a big shock really.
NEUT6|I guess on the thesis behind here of streaming as others, including as we have reported on and talked about recently, Dan Loeb citing as well why he is a huge believer in Disney.
NEUT7|Right, I mean it's got.
BEAR8|If you look at the stock it dropped down to the high 80s in March and really, that was because the earnings there was no nobody could forecast what's going on.
BULL9|Now you've got the direct to consumer business that's really executing and it's doing well.
BULL10|And I think Disney is becoming valued more and more as a content company in terms of what they have in production.
BULL11|What they have in their library, and they've really done well in the execution piece.
NEUT12|So what you have to look at is to say the legacy pieces of the business, the media assets.
NEUT13|At some point, Disney has to do something with that.
BULL14|But if you carve it out and you look to the future and at some point as we have talked about before early in the show with the vaccine, hopefully coming ahead, the theme parks earnings will start improving too.
NEUT15|So I do agree with this.
BULL16|The stocks had a good bounce on the back.
BEAR17|It's still not back to where it was in February.
BEAR18|It still down about 5% of the year I owned it.
BULL19|It's a good position.
NEUT20|I bought a lot of it in March and April as you know, and I would keep it and add it to you know to any new accounts at these levels.
NEUT21|Def you sold it in February.
NEUT22|I did, yeah well anyway, good money in it and everything.
NEUT23|No, now you know.
NEUT24|I mean, I look, I totally believe everything that sort of saying and I think it is definitely open stock.
NEUT25|And if you believe in the reopen you know I do, then you certainly can own this stock and it should do well 'cause you're looking at back to Tropf earnings, right?
NEUT26|Right about now my my issue with these guys.
NEUT27|They have to spend a ton of money on Disney Plus and I also there's still a lot of concern in terms of what's happening in sports.
NEUT28|What that's going to be the parks?
BULL29|I think you know you're at minimum capacity and so I think even if they do, we do reopen and they do see better.
NEUT30|Earnings ahead, I kind of feel like at this valuation it's already reflecting a lot of good news and you know me.
NEUT31|"I have a ton of re open stocks anyway that I prefer over Disney."""
