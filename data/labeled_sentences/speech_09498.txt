NEUT0|"""Heidi YouTube, let's talk about CPS age technologies guys."
NEUT1|So let's talk today.
NEUT2|Has seen something that was pretty crazy to me because it comes from 14 down to 11 all the way back at 14.
NEUT3|Kind of made a V shape when we opened up today we opened up actually pretty green, but this stock opened up red and it kind of, you know, bounce back.
NEUT4|I also do want to talk about my process and Allison also stock predictions for CPS H stock.
BULL5|'cause I do think CPS technology is going to be a great company long term.
NEUT6|But before I get onto the video I do kind of want to go over something as well.
NEUT7|See PSH Technologies have started.
NEUT8|You know, been on the volatile.
NEUT9|Ever since the earnings have come on 26th of February and they look like they come from around the $22.00 mark going all the way down to where we are today.
NEUT10|At $14.00.
BEAR11|So around a 30% loss in a recent month.
NEUT12|So we could expect you know what is going to happen to CPS technologies after we see the downtrend.
NEUT13|So I do kind of went over there today.
NEUT14|So let's take a look at it one day chart when we take a look at it one day chart you kind of see the V shape here and it is something that I believe you know it was bound to happen because I did think that this needed to take a breather that some people had sold off.
BEAR15|And then more people had bought the dip, 'cause I think that what happened here because it went down all the way to almost $11.00 on the 52 week range.
BEAR16|We seen $30 being the highest and we sent a low of $0.88.
NEUT17|So that is crazy.
NEUT18|Imagine if you bought $0.88, a sort of $30 you have been over 3000% up is this *****.
BEAR19|Volume is pretty low due to you know not a lot of people actually talk about this stock and there's not movement really into this dock, so sometimes we see big movement into this doctor.
NEUT20|Sometimes we won't, so the volume was 1.592 million with an average volume of 1.2 million in a 10 day.
NEUT21|Which, being a little bit higher, around 20% higher than, say, something good for this talk, 'cause it can show momentum or impossible sell off.
NEUT22|But the market cap is sitting 189,000,000 for this stock.
NEUT23|But the biggest thing I do want to kind of go over here.
BULL24|It's going to be my prosper diction because I do think CPS technology can go back up into the $20.00.
BEAR25|But if we do see it go down past around the $11.00 he could potentially go to $9.
NEUT26|But I do think this stock could honestly see around the 16 to $17.00 mark within next week.
BULL27|We can see this move back up.
NEUT28|We just need to kind of see what is exactly happening with this stock.
BULL29|We have resisted the 1671 in eight.
BULL30|11 a few times on this stock, and I do think that we will again, because potentially we're starting to move back up towards this, as long as we can suppress around the 1564, we could potentially see this stock go even further with CPS H technology, though it is something that we do need to take a look at because this talk is going to be one that will be based off the news as well and happy.
NEUT31|So a lot of people have been mentioning that CPS technologies have not really done anything, but they actually bought those naval ships and that could be something long term in their revenue as being said.
NEUT32|They did not have their next earnings, but we could see their earnings here soon when they actually do release them.
BULL33|As we can see, CPS Technologies is going to be a good stock to hold long term as well.
NEUT34|My long term prosper diction.
NEUT35|We could probably sit around the 25 to $30 again within 2023, but remember guys, I'm not a financial advisor is for entertainment purposes only.
