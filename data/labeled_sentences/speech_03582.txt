NEUT0|"""Update on Google Stocco alphabet there is not a lot to say about this."
NEUT1|Talk this talk.
NEUT2|They just sell those cells by itself.
NEUT3|It's well known as talk.
NEUT4|It's always it's bullish market.
NEUT5|It's a channel so we can see up trained.
NEUT6|This is the trend line and this is the top channel line and the idea is that this price is gonna reach sooner or later.
NEUT7|It's gonna go 1000 for sure.
NEUT8|It's gonna get 1520 AC towards at least before the virus and then it will crop.
BULL9|It will keep growing.
NEUT10|This is about Google guys.
NEUT11|It's one of the.
NEUT12|Biggest company in the world and this is what's gonna happen now that even now there is a lot of lockdown in different countries has been lifted.
NEUT13|So this is all again all the advertisements will go on again on Facebook etc etc.
NEUT14|So this seems to be a good opportunity to buy.
BULL15|Most good apartments.
NEUT16|Couple of days ago, when you know when we were at this level, but this is still a good opportunity to buy even for long term investment because those prices seems that my teacher.
NEUT17|They might go even above 1520.
NEUT18|There is no law to say because it's clear taking analysis, clear fundamental.
NEUT19|It's clear, a lot of analysts they're buying the majority of analysts are positive on this stock, so and I don't see I don't have any other idea or news that they can go against trained.
NEUT20|So and because we won't invest always interaction.
BULL21|This is a good opportunity or buying in and Google for now and for long term investment.
NEUT22|Always those information based on technical and a little bit of fundamental analysis.
NEUT23|Guys.
NEUT24|Just always very mind that technical analysis can be wrong because it is based on probabilities.
NEUT25|I would keep saying it always in all my videos.
NEUT26|It's not always.
NEUT27|It's not like a Bible and Bible, it's a way to say it's not like history or something like physics or maths that it's gonna work like that.
NEUT28|It's something that.
NEUT29|It's it's we're not sure, it's just probabilities.
NEUT30|OK, it's not under percent sure, but based on this channel that generally based because we channel where the prices are moving inside this channel, the idea that this prices to go up.
NEUT31|And based on a little bit of fundamental analysis, because the lot of lockdown has been lifted.
BULL32|This is good news for all those social networks where or even Google where you can advertise your business, because now people people start going out to start spending money, so it's good, even good, good it's.
BULL33|It's good to advertise now again.
NEUT34|So so I think that advertisement business is on again and this is what I meant.
NEUT35|So I think I don't see you.
BULL36|I don't see any negative news around the Google, so it's all positive it's good.
BULL37|Positive feedback by analyst, fundamental and technical.
BULL38|So I think it's good investment for long term investments to go longer right now with the with the Google.
NEUT39|"Thanks bye."""
