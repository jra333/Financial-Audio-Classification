NEUT0|"""Are you going to take a look at KGET there is not a lot of information I can add here honestly."
NEUT1|There really isn't April 21st 0003.
NEUT2|Watch for a break a 0003 and hit 4 something seems to be up here in my opinion.
NEUT3|Again that was five months ago over five months ago.
NEUT4|Now this was requested to have us take a look at and as always I mean that's what I'm doing here.
NEUT5|Is taking a look at it for you guys.
NEUT6|It's not, you just need more volume.
NEUT7|What it ultimately comes down to is going to be the interest in the volume.
NEUT8|In this one there was a quite a few areas here where we went off the 0001 up to the 0002.
NEUT9|We see over here, 592,000,000 shares traded.
NEUT10|Of course, it sounds like a ton of shares.
NEUT11|It is a lot, but when you're at the 0001, you're going to get a lot of volume.
BULL12|You're going to get a lot of volume.
NEUT13|That's kind of normal.
NEUT14|Usually once you get the volume of city buys will start coming off their the volume of lower, the higher it goes.
NEUT15|Hopefully you get the point there, but again, I am not going to get too excited here until.
NEUT16|See the three sitting.
NEUT17|So again, I'm going to put today's date in here 0001.
NEUT18|Watch or.
NEUT19|Alright, so I'm going to keep this one simple again so you don't think that I'll let you guys down didn't get a chance to get to it, but right now again 0001.
NEUT20|Watch for 000 three hits in volume to return.
NEUT21|That's I mean that's what it's going to come down to here with CGT, but either way, you know the volume right now about 23 million.
NEUT22|Like I said, it really comes down that volume 14 million not to get too much movement on there.
NEUT23|If you get a half million share trade day.
NEUT24|Sure this can go from 00010003 and then keep in mind when you get those volumes of first few days, but I've personally noticed.
NEUT25|Is a lot of turning between the 0001 and three of people essentially just flipping it and making a few 100 bucks here and there?
NEUT26|That's what happens here, but once you get that volume in there to push you past that point, you're not going to be too concerned about it anymore.
NEUT27|But as a reminder, CGT, if you haven't already, hit that like and subscribe and get out there.
