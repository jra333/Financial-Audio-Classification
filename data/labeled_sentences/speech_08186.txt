BEAR0|"""Is there a bad time of day to trade stocks?"
BEAR1|Maybe a story in today's Wall Street Journal finds buying and selling by individual investors is heavy in the minutes right after the market opens, which is often the most perilous time of the trading day.
NEUT2|Here with more details as WSJ Reporter, Cory Bush, Cory.
BULL3|Thanks so much for being with us.
NEUT4|Give us a sense of what's happening in the first few minutes after that opening Bell.
NEUT5|Yeah, so in the first few minutes we see a lot of orders coming from retail investors.
NEUT6|Kind of mom and pop investors who.
NEUT7|Went home the night before.
NEUT8|Read the news.
NEUT9|Decided I want to sell my stock.
NEUT10|Or maybe this is the time I want to buy at that same time since the market is just opened, the spreads between what people who are selling stocks want for their stock and the price that people are willing to pay are the widest.
NEUT11|Which means that you could.
BEAR12|It could be very costly.
NEUT13|So when does this volatility generally settle down?
NEUT14|You know, we say in our story about the 1st 30 minutes.
NEUT15|But really, the 1st 10 minutes are the biggest time, so I hear that and if I'm an individual investor I think I'm just going to sleep in.
NEUT16|I mean, why start before 10 but The thing is that that is what we would probably call individual investors, but I think it's just habit.
NEUT17|But at night you put in your order.
BEAR18|Maybe you're going to work and you can't trade from your work computer or Monday morning's the worst.
BEAR19|I mean, is there a backlog from people who place orders all weekend?
NEUT20|You know, we haven't.
NEUT21|We don't see the data right, right, right?
NEUT22|Anecdotally, we've heard from financial advisors that that is when.
NEUT23|They sometimes will get calls, especially in the last few weeks with a lot of news coming out of overseas market right?
NEUT24|And a lot of volatility coming there.
NEUT25|You're seeing what's happening in other markets and the panic is maybe it's going to happen in the US.
NEUT26|So what do the experts you spoke to advise?
NEUT27|Well, besides maybe being more flexible and not saying just sell immediately.
NEUT28|There's also this idea.
NEUT29|So obviously waiting the 1st 10 minutes indoors 30 minutes is key, but if you do really need to place that order.
NEUT30|Baby do a limit order down to a market order.
NEUT31|A limit order means that you're putting strict limitations on at what price you're willing to sell at.
NEUT32|What is the lowest price price you're willing to sell or the highest price you're willing to buy and try not to dive in when everything is very wise.
BEAR33|If things are moving sharply, you could get stuck selling a very low price.
NEUT34|You do not want to do that.
BULL35|"Thank you so much for that, of course."""
