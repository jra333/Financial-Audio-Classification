BULL0|"""One year into the trade war and more than 50 companies have announced or are reportedly considering plans to move their production out of China."
NEUT1|A new deep piece in The Economist takes a deep dive into what it calls the slow unraveling of global supply chains and why we're seeing an exodus of manufacturers from China for more.
NEUT2|We're joined by the author of that Special report, Vijay Vaitheeswaran.
NEUT3|He is U.S. business editor for The Economist.
NEUT4|He also lived in China for six years, so you know from which you speak.
NEUT5|Are these threats or are these permanent moves out of China?
NEUT6|Global supply chains are undergoing their biggest transformation in three decades, and the surprises it's not mainly because of the trade wars.
NEUT7|That's just pouring a bit of gasoline on a fire.
NEUT8|The two main reasons are we're at the end of the cheap China sourcing model, and the other is that really globalization is becoming slow, alization, and that's leading to more of a regional focus on supply chains.
NEUT9|For example, the auto cluster in North America.
BULL10|We're seeing a lot more of regionalization within Asia and Europe as well.
NEUT11|Would the pace of the departures be the same or be less if we did not have the tariffs?
BULL12|Of course it's increasing the pace.
NEUT13|There's no question how is there a way to gauge here says you just said companies would still be leaving, even if it wasn't for the test, right?
NEUT14|But you have to ask the question, why would they leave in?
NEUT15|Among the reasons, for example, our technologies, and we're seeing a lot more application of artificial intelligence, predictive analytics.
NEUT16|That's changing the way.
NEUT17|Markets are looking at supply chains, allowing them to go faster.
BEAR18|The other point is supply chains are getting shorter.
NEUT19|The Amazon effect, the on demand economy means it's more useful for companies to have supplies closer to the consumer where you can deliver quickly.
NEUT20|You know one day delivery is going to come to our delivery and ultimately report in this special report.
NEUT21|Amazon is thinking, how can we get to 15 minute delivery and you can't do that from China?
NEUT22|You can't, but.
NEUT23|I guess that fine line Vijay is the gap between what people are willing to pay for convenience and what they're simply willing to pay.
NEUT24|This is the tension you put your finger right on it as we move from an old model of globalization.
NEUT25|That was make it incredibly cheap.
BULL26|Sell it at Walmart for a few bucks and that was an efficient model.
NEUT27|Every year, cut costs one or two percent were now entering a messier world of slab alization, but one way you can have smarter, shorter, faster supply chains.
BULL28|And that's going to create a lot of possibilities for companies that want to.
NEUT29|Let's say bespoke brands or rapid turn around more innovation.
NEUT30|Innovation loops get faster when you're closer to the customer.
NEUT31|You can have Zara model.
NEUT32|For example if we OK so you know you look at India.
NEUT33|For example.
BULL34|OK India has been winning some of this business.
NEUT35|The thing about India that people may not realize is that India uses British law.
NEUT36|Contracts are much easier to enforce in India than they are in China.
NEUT37|Is India going to be the big winner here and if not them who?
NEUT38|So there's no one big winner, and in fact even China is not a big loser.
BULL39|And here's why China itself is a major market and that's part of the even with its slowest growth in many, many years, which has been headline in the last couple of days, China is growing more today.
NEUT40|Once you account for the base effect of how big its economy is than it did 20 years ago or 10 years ago.
BULL41|It's adding more new consumption than any other big economy.
NEUT42|And so the Patrick factories that used to supply the world.
NEUT43|"Are pivoting to supply China and the rest of you remember?"""
