NEUT0|"""How do I make money now forget about defensive?"
NEUT1|Forget about the political mumbo jumbo.
NEUT2|How do I opportunistically place capital now to create Alpha by the end of the year?
NEUT3|Did I sound like an institutional guy there?
NEUT4|You did I. I got told this by was sitting on the fence by by a client this morning already.
BEAR5|So I'm feeling very nervous about this kind of thing.
NEUT6|I think the difficulty is that in the four weeks to the election this market could be could go every which way could be very choppy here as we try to digest it but but if I but if I had to place a bet I would be placing a bet that opinion polls aren't usually this wrong and that the US is refocusing away from equity friendly, tech friendly in particular.
NEUT7|Towards towards US households that that were going to come out of the election on the other side of it with a big current account deficit in the United States and so I want to come out of this short the dollar long.
NEUT8|The idea that the world is going to be feeling, but it's still a long road.
BULL9|Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.
NEUT10|I want you to address now.
NEUT11|Mr Jukes you in the trenches of actually winning and losing on Wall Street.
BEAR12|Various calls of a massive dollar weakening.
NEUT13|They're out there.
BEAR14|They're using from academics, so usually at 60,000 feet the dollar is going to go down 20 percent, 35% whatever the statistic is, is that tangible reading, or is it a waste of time?
BEAR15|It's I mean the dollar is going to go down over the next few years, but the reality is it won't do it in a straight line.
NEUT16|The market is positioned long euros, long yen and so by definition short dollars we you know it'll be a much, much, much easier trade when we get to global reflation and when capital is flowing to emerging market assets and it's a straight line for the dollar, the way it was in the last big emerging market rally.
NEUT17|But we aren't there.
BEAR18|So it's fine to say it'll be 20% lower in five years time, but the first six months of that can be difficult.
NEUT19|I will be much more confident of those trends once I get past the 3rd of November, and I can take the right now.
BEAR20|"Biggest piece of uncertainty off the table."""
