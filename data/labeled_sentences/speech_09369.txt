BULL0|"""Welcome back to another video guys."
BULL1|So I was going through my ticker symbol before I go to bed as one does every night of faithful stock investor and I actually notice that C Civ was up 8% right?
NEUT2|Pretty much at the close of after hours close to like 7-8 PM and I was like OK like what's going on?
NEUT3|This doesn't just happen so I actually I quickly went on the Internet, did a little bit of research and I found this screenshot from well.
NEUT4|This Twitter accounts talk talk.
NEUT5|Weekly and this is a screenshot from a Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT6|Which shows a preliminary info alert saying that Civ or Churchill Capital Corp. Four is proposed to acquire Lucid, OK and if the keyword there is proposed, they're just in the negotiation stage.
NEUT7|But even just confirmation of the talk.
NEUT8|Is pretty big and I think that's why after hours we can see that.
BULL9|Trucial Capital Civ is up by 8.10%.
BEAR10|OK, so again, this is pretty big news, and I think This is why the stock has popped off.
NEUT11|I just wanted to let you guys know again we can see here.
NEUT12|This is just preliminary info may change, so again, this is still a very very risky.
NEUT13|Of course I own some shares of Civ and I plan on definitely holding long term if it's actually with lucid, because if you've seen lucid cars there sort of on the higher end EV stage.
NEUT14|So I really like the company.
NEUT15|I like what it's doing, so I mean like again, I'm dedicated to this and I will hold if they are going to propose.
NEUT16|And actually the deal will go through with Lucy.
BULL17|OK, so we can see the stock jumps by like 8% just on that news so I could see it.
NEUT18|If you know maybe a week down the line.
BULL19|If the merger is actually announced, this stock will go up by potentially even another 50% just on that news.
NEUT20|OK, so just on the news on talk.
BULL21|So the stock is up by 9%, right?
NEUT22|So Judicial Capital Corp. Ivy proposed to acquire lucid Motors.
NEUT23|The transaction was proposed on 14th of January.
NEUT24|Financial terms of the transaction are unknown.
NEUT25|OK, so I just thought I would let you guys know now to end it off.
NEUT26|I know it's late at night, so let's just ended up with some comments leaked.

NEUT28|Is proposed to acquire Lucid.

NEUT30|We're going to the moon.
NEUT31|OK, so I think there's got to be a space ship emoji on the thumbnail here.
NEUT32|Question is, can my 2000 shares be worth 200K in two months?
NEUT33|Well, let's see.
NEUT34|OK, so this one is really, really funny.
