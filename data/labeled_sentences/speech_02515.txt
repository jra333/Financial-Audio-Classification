NEUT0|"""Let's first clear up the go, the goober versus Gomer Pyle."
NEUT1|Controversy, alright, which you initiated.
NEUT2|Earlier today, with your piece in which you quoted, Goober, Pyle or Gomer Pyle, Gomer went goober.
BEAR3|Unfortunately, the actor who played Goober passed away this past week.
NEUT4|I got an email.
NEUT5|I had no idea.
NEUT6|First of all, you know that he was your door.
BEAR7|You apologized over the goober fame.
NEUT8|The whole goober clan.
NEUT9|The pile plan.
NEUT10|Sorry bout that, but you know, Gomer Jim AKA Jim Nabors is alive and well right.
NEUT11|But the Mr Lindsey, I don't know his actual name, George Lindsey.
NEUT12|George Lindsey who was the was the Goober Pyle who was Gomer's cousin on the Andy Griffith show Brothers.
NEUT13|He would have.
NEUT14|What does this have to do with earnings?
NEUT15|Really has nothing to do with it.
NEUT16|Just was a way to segue into it.
NEUT17|Surprise, surprise, surprise.
NEUT18|I can't say it.
NEUT19|The Alabama accent that he has.
NEUT20|But that's The thing is that you know surprises.
NEUT21|They don't.
NEUT22|They don't get here.
NEUT23|We have a chart which I'm not sure really tells us anything.
BULL24|Other than Wall Street has reached a certain date on tour, accord with America CEOs, which is look, we're going to get guidance from you guys.
NEUT25|It's always going to come in a bit lower and then you guys going to beat the numbers then go home happy.
NEUT26|But then I get there, right?
NEUT27|That's pretty much the pattern.
NEUT28|I mean, how many times have you listen to a lot of conference calls?
BEAR29|Great quarter guys, you know, kind of makes me sick to my stomach actually because it's it's a little choppy.
NEUT30|With man.
BEAR31|It's really weird calls.
NEUT32|Sucking up to the CEO's right there on the call comes back as a journalist.
NEUT33|It's sort of, you know, yeah, but as a former analyst, I never said that.
NEUT34|You know in any language, but anyway, so it's, I mean you.
BULL35|You know, saying that 70% of companies beat expectations.
NEUT36|Ain't saying much.
NEUT37|It's pretty much par for the course has been for the last decade, back when analysts used to get, you know, whispers in their ears.
NEUT38|You know, they wouldn't tell him necessarily the exact number that you're getting warmer, you getting colder.
NEUT39|You know, then, that wouldn't happen as much analysts look good if they nailed the number.
NEUT40|Now companies, can you know, can basically put guidance out there and then make sure that it's that it's conservative.
NEUT41|Do you think I'm going to go back to some of my Business School debate topics that we're going to talk about?
NEUT42|I want.
BEAR43|Yes, no answers from you.
NEUT44|No, no dilly dallying Spencer OK the debate years ago was the company shouldn't even do quarterly numbers, because it makes.
NEUT45|Management short term focused two focused on quarterly earnings.
NEUT46|They manage manipulate the gardening should U.S. companies have quarterly earnings yes or no?
BEAR47|They should be cut because that by that argument they shouldn't have stock options either.
NEUT48|They should you know, because they that also motivates them.
NEUT49|So the short second question should or should they not provide guidance on a quarterly basis basis?
NEUT50|I think it's fine to do so.
NEUT51|I think as long as the rest of the world takes it with pictures or knows I think yes, as long as you see what they're doing.
NEUT52|Yes, it's fine, it's harmless, harmless, and should the stock market react as abruptly or with the volatility that it does 2 plus or minus little changes on whether or not they beat earnings or not.
NEUT53|Of course not, of course, but going back to your first question, should they have quarterly numbers, were right about ahead of the tape.
BEAR54|You know, I'd be like I'd be out of a job.
BEAR55|I'd be out selling apples on 6th Ave, you know, be terrible.
NEUT56|I like that kind of that reason alone.
NEUT57|That's why you're popular on this show differences that kind of that kind of cynical insight that allows us to do what we do every day.
NEUT58|Spencer Jacob ahead of the tape.
BULL59|"Thank you very much."""
