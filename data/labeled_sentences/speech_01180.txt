BULL0|"""Hello and thanks for stopping by everyone."
NEUT1|Today we're going to be looking at Neo so quickly before we get into the video.
NEUT2|Just about the channel a little bit.
NEUT3|I posted daily about stocks and stocks to look out for if they dip or go up an like which ones you should buy and price predictions heading into the future as we get closer to 2021 and things like that so that interest you.
NEUT4|Make sure you subscribe and hit the Bell.
BEAR5|So after the video, Neo overall remained super bullish long term in the Iowa.
NEUT6|Most investors, including myself, just because it has so much potential.
NEUT7|So one of the topic of the video, what could cause need to go up to $60.00 is this upcoming week just quickly looking back at what Neo did this past week?
NEUT8|There wasn't a whole lot of fluctuation.
BULL9|We did go up $3 in the week though, but this upcoming month is going to be a big month heading into the new year.
NEUT10|So this upcoming month is going to be a big month.
BULL11|Just because we were heading up in January.
NEUT12|An January 9th is Neo Day, So what Neo Day is the company pretty much shows off their products in like future plans for the company and how they're going to grow.
BULL13|But this year Neo Day, they're expected to release a new sedan, which it's their first sedan which is going to help to expand their range of cars which will help them grow, especially if they're going to get into Europe and around the world.
BULL14|More in the coming years, which would be a big thing for them.
BULL15|Overall, I think we're ready for another jump too from what we're currently at the 60.
BULL16|Just because we did have, we did go up $3 this past week, but it was kind of slow compared to the last couple of weeks, so I feel like we kind of consolidated just a little bit around this range.
BULL17|We could be ready for a jump up to 60.
NEUT18|Mainly because Neo Day is coming up with another like about a month.
BEAR19|So that will be a huge contributor to the stock price increasing I think.
BEAR20|So looking at the price of the Neo stock for the upcoming month up until Neo Day, I do expect us to increase up until that point we may even increase a little bit too much and pull back just because it might give way overhyped.
BEAR21|Which is common with things like this, but overall I think the prices at right now is really good and I don't think will drop much lower than maybe possibly.
NEUT22|48 to 50 maybe ever again, unless something some bad news comes out, so it's really not a bad time to either add to your position or looking forward to whether or not it might be alright in 2021.
NEUT23|I'm thinking it could be around 100 to 105 per share.
NEUT24|It's all really going to depend on how quickly and how much they ramp up their production and their sales.
BULL25|But overall, it's going.
BULL26|It's looking good for the future like I'm very excited about this stock.
NEUT27|There's a lot of other stocks will be talking about and posting about, but this is one of my favourites at the moment.
NEUT28|Just to end things off, I do have to clarify.
NEUT29|I'm not a financial advisor, so anything you hear me saying or doing.
NEUT30|I am personally doing them with my own money, but.
NEUT31|It's not a financial advice.
NEUT32|This is all just for entertainment purposes, so make sure you do.
NEUT33|Don't fall into the hype of videos saying stocks will go up a ton.
NEUT34|"Make sure you do your own research and then invest with your own money."""
