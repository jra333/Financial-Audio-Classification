NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this."
NEUT1|Be a video chart on ticker symbol BA Boeing.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well another day, higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT6|So updates here certainly need to be made first.
NEUT7|Update is just based on what I would call the ideal of supporters.
BULL8|Claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT9|Now going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT10|Can say above 262.
NEUT11|Now don't get me wrong if the price falls below 262, that does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL12|But yeah, if the price couldn't manage step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view of that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT16|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
BULL17|The Bulls are in full control heading West.
NEUT18|Visualize that that is what is being represented again yes and about 262 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
BEAR19|Gotta squeeze down the chart here quite a bit on this one, 'cause it has been a very long time.
NEUT20|In fact, let's just do this.
NEUT21|Let's go to the daily time frame 'cause it's been that long since the price of an up around this area, which is again a good problem to have.
BEAR22|So even on the daily time frame you can see gotta squeeze things down here quite a bit.
NEUT23|But next key level of resistance watch very closely.
NEUT24|Not going to be there up at the 278 mark and then after 278 next level after that right up there around.
NEUT25|The $300 mark.
NEUT26|So there you go.
BULL27|It's approaching within striking distance of $3, so we'll see if the price continues to work its way up there, but no doubt about it.
BULL28|A whole lot of upward momentum right now.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL32|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT38|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live.
