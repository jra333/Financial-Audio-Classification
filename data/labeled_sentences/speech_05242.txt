NEUT0|"""Everyone."
NEUT1|I'm taking a look at Netflix.
NEUT2|I bought Netflix a long time ago.
NEUT3|December, I believe at about $65 a share, some like that 67 days.
NEUT4|Looking at it now, it's at 109 statically type of play that I would.
NEUT5|Get into because the P ratio is so high, but I don't know.
BEAR6|I mean just July we talking $300 stock lost one.
NEUT7|Oh 941.
NEUT8|I'm not saying I'm going to get it.
NEUT9|Look, I'm gonna buy some tomorrow.
NEUT10|I'm gonna buy some tomorrow.
NEUT11|I don't know how much, maybe not much give myself a little bit in that I got I got.
NEUT12|I got a small position right now.
NEUT13|Can we get some more tomorrow?
NEUT14|But where I'm going to try and buy a lot.
NEUT15|Just if you can get down in the 60s right there she was only six years.
NEUT16|While there goes 65-5 maybe 67.
NEUT17|I don't know.
NEUT18|I have to check my investments.
NEUT19|So yeah, if you get in the 60s and buy it.
NEUT20|I mean, I don't know.
BEAR21|I just feel like this is pretty volatile.
NEUT22|I think a lot of people come and go like it loving and hating whatever.
BULL23|But it's going to move around and I think if you get it low enough you have a good shot at making some money.
NEUT24|I mean, I mean, I think the highest my flip I think was that like about 90%, I mean on Netflix.
NEUT25|I didn't cash out, I'm gonna tell you right now.
NEUT26|Never cashed out of that.
NEUT27|But I just I don't know why.
NEUT28|I just want to keep it.
NEUT29|I'm I'm kind of like.
NEUT30|The guy that buys it holds dollar cost averaging.
NEUT31|Bring my cost for sure down.
NEUT32|Whatever, I usually don't sell.
NEUT33|Should have sold there, but I don't.
NEUT34|I didn't have that much so I didn't remember.
NEUT35|If you look at here 52 refrain, just crazy 62 to three or four.
BULL36|Thanks for share 417.
NEUT37|Market cap over 6 billion institutionally owned 82% so it gets down to.
NEUT38|I'm buying it anywhere on there hungry.
NEUT39|We just under 60 I'm taking along right?
NEUT40|I love this.
NEUT41|I love this talk.
NEUT42|His love networks in general.
NEUT43|I'm watching Netflix right now.
NEUT44|Just one of my favorite company so.
NEUT45|Are you biased towards it?
NEUT46|No, I'm not.
NEUT47|I'm not your professional stock guy.
NEUT48|You know I buy based on how I like it.
NEUT49|So let's company and let's say I buy it at 109.
NEUT50|It goes down to 30 bucks.
NEUT51|What do I do?
NEUT52|I buy more at 30 bucks or bring my cost on this.
NEUT53|No big deal.
BEAR54|That's why I don't understand why people lose so much money in the stock market.
NEUT55|I mean, no, not.
NEUT56|No reason to doubt $20,000 if it's your only $20,000.
NEUT57|You don't fit into a stock at a price you don't know if it's going down or up.
NEUT58|So you buy a little bit now see where it is and if it goes up.
NEUT59|Cash out if you want.
NEUT60|Or wait for it, come back down by someone you know, do what you want to do.
NEUT61|You just have to.
NEUT62|This has never claimed I don't.
NEUT63|I don't know.
NEUT64|I'm not gonna buy it at 109.
NEUT65|It goes down to eating, sell it all out and you freaking out.
NEUT66|I would buy more buy more will start to go up a little bit so I do.
BEAR67|It goes down to half a cent.
NEUT68|OK, buy more.
NEUT69|All day, that's just how I play.
NEUT70|So Netflix baby.
NEUT71|"Check it out."""
