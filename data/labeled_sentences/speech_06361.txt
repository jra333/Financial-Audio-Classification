BULL0|"""The NASDAQ did bounce a bit here, just South of 13."
BEAR1|K was briefly the lowest since January 29th.
NEUT2|Let's get to Botosani pay Bob.
BULL3|Good morning guys.
NEUT4|Happy Thursday and this is the kind of open the market really likes because you've got a broad rally.
BULL5|You have the tech sector up and you've got the reopening sector up, so you've got energy up.
NEUT6|Got generally banks up and take a look what's going on, industrials doing well, consumer staples, generally flat, the lagging, but that's been the story all year, so it's this pleases the bull when you see this.
BEAR7|The problem is the damage is already done.
BEAR8|We've got a significant correction going on in a number of sectors, and it's not just technology, by the way.
BEAR9|So if you look IPOs, 16% off their recent highs, a lot of these hit their highs back in January early February biotech.
NEUT10|Both the IBB and the other major ETF, fourteen 1516% authorize China, which was the biggest market of the year up until the middle of February.
BEAR11|10% correction there.
NEUT12|NASDAQ 100.
BEAR13|Heading that direction down 8% mega caps.
NEUT14|Or you know, some of them that the chip sector is basically hit their highs in the middle of January.
BEAR15|So Xilinx and AMD like this 20% off of their highs there AMD I think is 18 percent 28%.
NEUT16|That's a typo there.
BULL17|Facebook, Apple, Amazon, they all hit their highs.
NEUT18|Amazon awhile ago, Apple again in the middle of January.
BULL19|The good news is the multiples on these are coming down and that's very good news for the market.
NEUT20|So if you look at the end of January, Apple is trading at 34 * 2021 earnings numbers.
NEUT21|That's a very high multiple for them.
BEAR22|Now it's come down to 27.
BULL23|That's a lot more reasonable, and so the correction is good for the market, bringing the multiples now.
NEUT24|This all corresponded with the move up and interest rates.
NEUT25|Kathy Woods Ark Fund, for example.
NEUT26|High was February 16th.
NEUT27|That's not a coincidence.
NEUT28|That was when the interest rates started moving up.
BEAR29|The 10 year yield went from 1-1 to almost one two that very day within a day or two of that.
NEUT30|And that was the top there for a lot of these mega Cap tech Holdings.
BEAR31|She's down 22% since then, not a big route there.
BEAR32|Not a lot of people moving money out of the fund yet, so a lot of people still believe in her, but she's off 22% from the highs.
NEUT33|Just on February 16th.
NEUT34|So where are we right now?
NEUT35|The key story is the reopening narrative is still intact.
NEUT36|That's the most important thing that we've got the vaccine rollout in the reflation story.
BEAR37|But the rising bond yields have hurt the tech rally, and they will.
BEAR38|Mentem indicators are stalling out the mega cap.
NEUT39|Tech names overall.
NEUT40|Finally, Jim was mentioning the Buzz ETF.
NEUT41|A lot of hype around this.
NEUT42|We're going to have Jamie wise on at 12:30.
NEUT43|He's the originate are of the buzz ETF just started trading 2 minutes ago.
NEUT44|Here.
NEUT45|This is the van Eck Social Security number one that it tracks 75 stocks, most bullish sentiment.
NEUT46|Largest Holdings know.
NEUT47|GameStop folks, Twitter Draft Kings, Ford American Airlines, Facebook here.
NEUT48|And so they've been very aggressive saying we are not the Reddit ETF he's going to push back on that.
NEUT49|Of course he's made it a lot more complicated for himself.
NEUT50|By bringing in Dave Portnoy or they Portnoy excuse me and what we've got, Karl here essentially is a whole of mirrors.
NEUT51|We have the owner of an index company hyping it index who is himself the subject of the index, so this is that whole sort of postmodern conundrum you have where we're all in a Hall of mirrors.
NEUT52|Sort of staring at each other.
NEUT53|It's an interesting question for people wanting to invest in this.
NEUT54|The social media actually indicate a direction for stock prices, number one and #2.
NEUT55|Is there an issue here for regulators at all?
NEUT56|When you have this kind of.
NEUT57|Of set up we don't know what the answer is and I'm not sure the regulators know either.
NEUT58|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT59|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
