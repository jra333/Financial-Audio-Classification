BULL0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the gold market, and as you can see we have formed a massive triangle."
BEAR1|We have bounced from that uptrend line and now we're just kind of hanging around 1700 as we look towards the jobs figure.
BEAR2|The jobs figure of course will be horrific, so I anticipate that people will probably be more apt.
NEUT3|To buy Gold, didn't sell it?
BULL4|Furthermore, I would point out that we have been consolidating after a massive move to the upside.
NEUT5|That's not a bullish flag, it just happens to be how I drew it.
NEUT6|At this point, I like the idea of buying a breakout above 1725.
BULL7|We should go reaching towards the highs eventually.
BULL8|If we break down below here and test the 50 day Ma, that should be supportive.
NEUT9|The $1600 level underneath is the absolute floor.
BEAR10|We could get a bit of a sell off like this if we get a massive margin call in the stock market.
NEUT11|I look at that as a gift.
NEUT12|You can see what's happened since that formed.
BEAR13|This inverted hammer here got broke to the upside at this point in time we're about.
BULL14|"$190.00 North of where we started an at one point well over 250."""
