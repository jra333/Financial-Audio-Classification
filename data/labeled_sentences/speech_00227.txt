NEUT0|"""Now I have been telling people that if you get President Biden and he wants if he says solar, what he really should be thinking is not just giant fields of solar panels."
NEUT1|He should be thinking about alternatives to current use alternatives to combustion engines.
NEUT2|I regard Plug Power is being perhaps the and I'm going to use the phrase maybe I shouldn't be.
NEUT3|The new diesel.
NEUT4|Is it possible that hydrogen could be the new diesel?
NEUT5|I think Jim many people believe that and again I would go back to our customer base.
NEUT6|You look at people like Amazon and Walmart who have sustainability goals for 2030 and 2040 looking to eliminate their trucks.
NEUT7|And there's really only one way to do long distance hauling or anything over 125 miles.
NEUT8|And that's using fuel cells and from a cost competitive point of view.
NEUT9|When I think about green hydrogen at $3 a kilogram.
NEUT10|They kilograms about equivalent to $2.00 a gas thing.
NEUT11|Generally you can see you know selling green hydrogen and six to $7.00 a kilogram and being very competitive with diesel fuel to death.
NEUT12|Now there are companies that are obviously making that bet because people may not realize that you have a very strong sales pipeline even as it comes to 2024, correct?
NEUT13|That is correct, Jim and you know it's we have pedestal customers.
NEUT14|You know I mentioned Walmart and Amazon, Home Depot, DHL, and many others.
NEUT15|So what happens when do we do?
NEUT16|People realize that plug power is not speculative, but it is a company with a great book of business that is growing larger and larger.
NEUT17|In the meantime, some of these big issues, like what you're seeing behind you of Plug Power truck are going to be reality in our lifetime.
NEUT18|Well, Jim, you know I. I grew up in the wireless industry.
NEUT19|Believe it or not and I spend 1012 years before that market took off and I actually believe that time for hydrogen is today.
NEUT20|It reminds me sitting around the table 1994 nineteen, 95 in the wireless industry.
NEUT21|Well, that was when he realized that if you bought any one of them, you made a ton of money 'cause the consolidation was a kuring.
NEUT22|You had to be one.
NEUT23|Absolutely Jim into the hydrogen industry is just beginning and now I think is, you know it's not only thinking about Biden's policy, but thinking about our consumers policies or customers policies.
NEUT24|That's really what's driving the growth.
BULL25|Today in government, policies can just make it even better.
