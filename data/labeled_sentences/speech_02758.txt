BULL0|"""Elon Musk just passed."
NEUT1|Bill Gates become the second richest man in the world with a fortune of over $128 billion.
NEUT2|Now Musk's added $10 billion to his wealth just yesterday and today, and he is gained $100 billion just this year.
BULL3|That works out to $13 million per hour for all of 2020 now and the coming years, Musk will not only benefit from his 21% ownership of Tesla, but also from that huge compensation package.
BULL4|Granted back in 2018, which could award him options.
NEUT5|On 20 million more shares that could be worth $55 billion more.
NEUT6|Now he's already received the first three of 12 tranches of that stock, and he said to get the 4th pretty soon.
NEUT7|But if you look at one of the targets that Tesla was supposed to hit, it's expected to hit a market cap of $650 billion by 2028 for him to get that.
NEUT8|Now that sounded far fetched back in 2018, when the market cap was only $60 billion.
BULL9|Today, it's already topping 515.
NEUT10|Billion alright?
NEUT11|So what would Tesla share price have to get do for?
NEUT12|Must to pass Jeff Bezos as the richest person in the world?
NEUT13|Well, it's assumed that Amazon stock didn't change.
NEUT14|That's a big, big assumption, but Tesla would have to top $900 for must to get to the 183 billion.
NEUT15|Now Bezos has not been standing still.
NEUT16|He is added 67 billion to his wealth just this year, while the world's billionaires in total, I've added more than 1.3.
BULL17|Trillion to the wealth and John just as a quick aside, we marveled at Jeff Bezos reaching $100 billion.
NEUT18|It took him 20 years to do that.
NEUT19|And remember, Musk added 100 billion just in the 11 months.
NEUT20|Unprecedented back to you.
NEUT21|OK, so one of the takeaways, I think, is that the billionaires this year are doing OK. We don't have to worry too much about them.
NEUT22|Robert Frank.
NEUT23|Thank you.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
