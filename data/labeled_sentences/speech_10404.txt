NEUT0|"""We have a bizarre situation where some companies are doing very well and now you can always remember them through these blades of grass."
BEAR1|OK, but a lot of other companies are getting crushed 'cause the staff was able to pick up some.
NEUT2|I asked him for some weed just like this place is so well manicured.
NEUT3|The only way they can find so tonight I want to ignore the healthy grass and focusing all the weeds.
NEUT4|The stocks of the S&P that aren't working at all when you focus on that end of the worst performers, the SP 500.
NEUT5|What do we see?
NEUT6|Well, you know solve.
NEUT7|It's pretty darn obvious.
NEUT8|Remember cruising.
NEUT9|Yes, cruise ships, oils, pipelines, retailers, airlines, real estate, investment trusts that own office space, and banks when you think about it.
NEUT10|Maybe that's not such a big divide between Wall Street and Main Street.
BEAR11|After all, Wall Street knows all these industries are in trouble.
NEUT12|The real dividers between digitization and everything else we always get caught up in arguing about whether this is a U shaped recovery in the economy or the shape recovery, or an L shape recovery or a W shaped.
BULL13|Earlier this week I said we had a fabulous V shape recovery in the stock market, but not the economy.
NEUT14|Nothing close to that economy that actually made news.
NEUT15|After looking at the weed, so I think we need to rethink the whole terminology, it's.
NEUT16|It's not those letters that we, it's against the entire alphabet of pain.
NEUT17|One letter is not enough.
BEAR18|See for instance if you work or had a job at Norwegian Cruise or Carnival, the two West performers, DSP down 73 and 71%, you aren't feeling V for you or even a W shaped recovery.
BEAR19|You're feeling a key economy straight down after being flat.
BEAR20|If you're an Occidental Petroleum, the third worst performer down 67%.
NEUT21|Well, you know what you're in, you're in a Y economy.
NEUT22|As in, why would you be so stupid as to double down and pay a fortune for Anadarko Petroleum?
NEUT23|Right?
NEUT24|When I was rolling over.
BEAR25|If you own Cody, the beauty brand that's down 66% or Kohl's down 60%, you're in the AM economy, meaning every time you think you're going to go up yet, push right back down.
NEUT26|And if you work for United Airlines, off 61% American or 56 or Delta or 53 urine, ASI, economy, bottoming, but you're not going to be able to close that gap anytime soon.
NEUT27|Not gonna happen.
NEUT28|Oh, how about Simon properties?
BEAR29|The biggest owner of more properties with the stock that's fallen 56% white?
BEAR30|Call that an ex economy, both lines grounded down because Simon's trying to get out of their deal to double down on.
NEUT31|Coleman, another mall that they decided to acquire before the pandemic times everything.
BEAR32|Finally, there's Wells Fargo down 56% for the year where you were hoping and praying.
NEUT33|We would merely have an L shaped economy for them and not something worse.
NEUT34|You know, maybe it's a sagging L. Maybe it's someone with really bad handwriting.
NEUT35|Once you go through all the climbers, you realize this is a tale of two cities market.
NEUT36|It was the best of times.
BEAR37|It was the worst of times.
NEUT38|It was the spring of hope.
NEUT39|Was the winter of despair.
NEUT40|We had everything before us.
NEUT41|We had nothing before us.
BEAR42|The pain from Kovit is not totally isolated to small, medium sized businesses that simply don't trade publicly.
BEAR43|There are a lot lot of larger businesses experiencing their own terrible cycles of pain.
BEAR44|The market is full losers, they're just not big enough to offset the strength of the tech stocks that are making a fortune right now.
