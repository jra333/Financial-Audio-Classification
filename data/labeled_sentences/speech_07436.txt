NEUT5|If we draw the train line.
BEAR6|Data bearish position.
NEUT7|Amanda Barrish clan is confirmed the only wind it break this.
BEAR8|Train line down advisor still have the danger at me as the bear that I would launch my profit made so far.
NEUT9|With my $500 of investment, I got almost 500.
NEUT10|Is midnight got?
BULL11|100% return so far, but I would not close it for the profit and I with the latter trend rise.
BEAR12|I mean, I would line my trend until it down and bend, but I put that made a stop here at his new that if we have a kind of rebound and then I would lost my position.
NEUT13|I still have a little game here.
