NEUT0|"""So we have the weekly time chart for a YX and I just wanted to basically illustrate some of my thoughts on this in terms of price action."
NEUT1|Now Price has been stuck in this sort of consolidation zone if you like, but if you actually examine this in a bit more detail.
NEUT2|Then if he fibbed the swing high and swing low.
NEUT3|Regions here, then we can see how price actually reacted exactly at the 61.8%.
NEUT4|So this could be our xab and 61.8 as we know is a crab here.
NEUT5|So potentially this could be our.
NEUT6|Be done to see.
NEUT7|And the 161.
NEUT8|Is.
NEUT9|$235 OK.
NEUT10|So potentially.
NEUT11|This is quite an interesting harmonic pattern.
NEUT12|In in the ideal position to sort of take a view on now at the same time, if you actually just do this, view this as a 5050 screen.
NEUT13|Then we can also see how these stochastics have been strongly divergent.
NEUT14|Prices pretty much been locked in this sort of.
NEUT15|Double bottom mode if you like, and this is a good illustration of a divergent regular bullish divergance.
NEUT16|So for any bullish moves, I think this trend line here is quite an interesting trend line.
NEUT17|So if price breaks that trend line.
BULL18|And that would be that from a technical perspective, that would be a good indication that this harmonic pattern may complete OK.
NEUT19|So I just wanted to spend a couple of minutes very briefly just to illustrate this technical pattern.
NEUT20|If you're not familiar with harmonic patterns, divergences, or any of the technical patterns mentioned in this brief recording, then I would encourage you to check out the four links in the description below and I basically dissect each one of these technical patterns in great detail so you can have a bit more confidence in terms of basically what was being said in this recording.
