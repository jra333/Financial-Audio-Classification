NEUT0|"""That this company is not."
NEUT1|I mean, these people are not selling Shopify products right?
NEUT2|They still have to come up with their own business plan.
NEUT3|They have no no.
NEUT4|That's a matter fact, no Shopify actually and this is in the report Shopify.
NEUT5|You can make money on Shopify by just referring people to Shopify and that's affiliate marketing so it's not multi level marketing, its affiliate marketing.
NEUT6|You can also make money on Shopify by writing blogs about Shopify.
NEUT7|So there's there's many different ways.
NEUT8|The only thing that is different than, let's say in Herbalife, is you're not selling their own products.
NEUT9|But if you look at Shopify, will take most of their revenue is not coming from.
NEUT10|You know, in other words, how much are they paying out to these people?
NEUT11|Do we?
BULL12|Well, this is even better.
NEUT13|I mean, which even is even crazier.
NEUT14|So 50% of their revenue is subscription fees.
NEUT15|And let's say the other 50% is Merchant Services an A real pure SAS company like the ones I mentioned.
NEUT16|The Work Day Service nails of the world you're looking at 85% subscription revenue, so right there it shouldn't even be in the same League with those people at all.
NEUT17|And it's still trading at over 20 times sales.
NEUT18|Did you short this going into you coming out with this report and.
NEUT19|At what point, then, do you closeout the short?
BEAR20|I mean, the stock is down sharply today.
NEUT21|Oh, the stock has so much more to go.
BEAR22|I'm still short the stock and I'll stay short.
NEUT23|This stock and you know every analyst can come out.
NEUT24|I don't care if they defend it or what you're going to say.
BEAR25|This stop is expensive, it's illegal, they have heavy competition.
NEUT26|There's a finite amount of Tam to it, so there's this.
BULL27|"Has got a lot more way to go on the downside."""
