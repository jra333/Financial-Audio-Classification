NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Glenn this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do have an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint I do own shares of Amazon in my retirement accounts from the long side, so just keep that in mind as they go through the analysis.
NEUT5|Well, as of right now we have a very interesting dynamic here.
NEUT6|Moving forward an let me just get this into play first before.
NEUT7|And let me change this to green to represent support.
NEUT8|But I do want to note this is not.
NEUT9|I don't want to come across like this is some sort of special skill that I have or some sort of great discovery to be able to have done that.
NEUT10|I assure you, people that use charts, understand charts, know how to do what they did, what I did right there, and they've done the exact same thing.
NEUT11|In other words, a lot of people are going to be watching this red line, and I emphasize all that because when a lot of people are watching the same level and wondering the same thing, called a cellphone prophecy called whatever you want, it can definitely produce some very dynamic price movements.
NEUT12|And that's exactly what is going on with that area meaning, and by no means is there a guarantee those don't exist in the market.
NEUT13|But my core point here.
NEUT14|It's a more than valid thought to be having that you know if the price consolidates and then breaks down through that red line.
BEAR15|That could very well create quite a bit of downsides.
BEAR16|Selling pressure.
NEUT17|Again, not a guarantee, but a more than rational thoughts have.
NEUT18|So definitely keep a very close eye on that.
NEUT19|That'll be a level where if it is broken then again, not a guarantee, but I think you gotta like the fact that it will at least go down in there and test the 3110 Mark.
BEAR20|So 3110 next you know, stop, if not even probably lower than that.
NEUT21|If that red line right there fails, especially if it's the high volume break to the downside.
BEAR22|Then at that point you know I don't think anybody would be shocked to really see the price, then drop down below the 3100 Mark.
NEUT23|Now in the event, maybe this red line does hold like it's done the past couple of times and the price starts to bounce.
NEUT24|So in that event.
NEUT25|Let's map out a couple areas of resistance.
NEUT26|First level going to be out there around 3225, and then after 3225 next level up there right there at the 3250 mark.
NEUT27|But yeah, as of right now things are looking a little shaky, but we'll see how things play out on Wednesday.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
