NEUT0|"""Then we got to talk about Apple."
NEUT1|We had their earnings out after the Bell yesterday.
BEAR2|You were out with a note this morning calling it a jaw dropper December quarter.
BEAR3|Yet we're seeing shares under a bit of pressure today off just around 2%.
NEUT4|Why do you think we're seeing this reaction in the stock?
BULL5|Look, I mean, in my opinion, it's probably the best Apple quarter that I've seen in six to seven years.
NEUT6|I mean, this was a Cinderella story type of court in terms of a $5 billion iPhone beat and this really just shows the Super cycle.
NEUT7|It's not just hype, it's a reality.
NEUT8|And it's starting to play out.
NEUT9|And I believe 6 to 9 months now we're looking at $3 trillion mark app for Apple.
NEUT10|So right here when I look at stock being down a bit, I viewed as a buying opportunity and it continues right now to be a five year supercycle with services.
NEUT11|Part of the RE rating an Apple, I think that alone is worth 1.2 trillion.
NEUT12|I used to be an Apple lover.
BEAR13|I think that the $3 trillion call, I mean people do love these Apple products, but is there any concern that maybe quality is falling at Apple?
BEAR14|I mean we saw them release Big Sur far too early and there were a lot of hiccups in getting that out.
NEUT15|Yeah, I think ultimately, if you look from a hardware perspective at their releases from iPhone 12 to what we've seen in Air pods, two across Mac and of course with their own chip in terms of him.
BULL16|And that's important in terms of what we're seeing with their own Silicon, it's really been a renaissance of growth from a product perspective within Cupertino, they're always going to have some things here and there you talked about with Big Sur, but ultimately, whatever weaves the four walls within Cupertino has been met with massive success.
NEUT17|Especially over the last year or two, and I think that's why they continue to have that gold standard in terms of what we see for Apple, and you're seeing an iPhone 12 lot of skepticism in terms of the supercycle many thinking their best growth is in the rearview mirror.
NEUT18|"What you saw last night is mahome's type of growth."""
