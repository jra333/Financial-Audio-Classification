NEUT0|"""321 Here we are, MMT's."
NEUT1|We have a market maker Bill and some of the other MMT's are working on this bottom, called MCR.
NEUT2|Yes, right.
NEUT3|Here MCP.
NEUT4|This is MCP.
NEUT5|Here there's a bid, there's the ask here is that beautiful long short that we love and that we live for.
NEUT6|We live for a couple of various different things.
NEUT7|I can show you that we live for these breakouts.
NEUT8|Any empties that are market makers that are using a system that tells him to go this way as well.
NEUT9|Because the reality is that's what we do.
NEUT10|We make markets with the public when they want to go higher, and when the public bills we make markets on the way down and we get paid twice.
NEUT11|Right now what we're doing here.
NEUT12|What MMT Bill is we're trying to establish the final bottom at Bikini Line?
BEAR13|We had a teeny breakdown from here from this teeny line.
BEAR14|It went one teeny down to martinis at $0.23 a teeny.
NEUT15|That means that we're going to look to see how.
NEUT16|Bottom here, how the last teen he fell down 15 minutes.
NEUT17|Well, how do we leverage up and we just hit the last 15 minute ticker?
NEUT18|MCP MCP dog and that's how we want to make a market.
NEUT19|It's here.
NEUT20|It's now.
NEUT21|It's live.
NEUT22|This is what we do with the public.
NEUT23|That's what MMT's do.
NEUT24|MNTS enjoy making markets between who?
NEUT25|You, the buyer, and the seller.
NEUT26|And let us not be in denial of the truth because it's factual here now.
NEUT27|And not only that, it's the number one and only an largest firm on the Internet.
NEUT28|With real live trading with its MMT Marketmakers School Apprenticeship School.
NEUT29|This is what the apprenticeships go through.
NEUT30|Apprenticeships learn to go long, apprenticeships learn to go short, and we're making a market right here, NASDAQ breaking out his lie.
NEUT31|We got the NASDAQ breaking out one of the MMT said we got that NASDAQ breaking out.
NEUT32|I've got Google breaking out it's late day.
NEUT33|We're about down to exactly that what?
NEUT34|15 minute last bar?
NEUT35|So on the 15 minute last bar going into the closing Bell is where you look to see which names bounce quickly.
BEAR36|MCP is getting that entered a bottom.
NEUT37|What a beautiful trading beautifully making a market here and beautifully making a market this way.
NEUT38|And yesterday it made some very quick down market yesterday.
NEUT39|Look at those nice down ratios.
NEUT40|Look at these tight tight bump and grind market makers on the floor and what their role they walked him up and when there wasn't no one there.
NEUT41|Hey guess what?
NEUT42|See you later goodbye.
NEUT43|And the short gets on.
NEUT44|And that to MCP new market maker stock.
NEUT45|"That we've added to the list, and these are how bottoms get made in the last 15 minute hours."""
