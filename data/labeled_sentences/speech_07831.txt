NEUT0|"""And then getting to stock picks this evening."
NEUT1|Gary, sorry I can't change it.
NEUT2|Can I change it at this late stage?
NEUT3|You can.
BEAR4|Yes, OK, I'm going to the Walt Disney Company so doesn't spend an enormous amount of pressure recently, partly because there's been a management shakeup going, leaving coming back going again.
NEUT5|Yeah, exactly, and I think that's always got shareholders a little bit nervous.
NEUT6|And, you know, even with coronavirus and obviously a big money spinner for discovery is still there.
NEUT7|Their theme parks as well.
NEUT8|And obviously with.
BEAR9|The shutdown of operations with Corona virus that is going to impact it is going to come through in Q1 numbers, but we've seen the stock really punished.
BEAR10|I mean, if you look at that, that's a significant fall in the share price.
BEAR11|Part of it is because you've got that bad news around management.
BEAR12|I think management, shakeup, just making everyone nervous, shutdown of parks that is going to impact Q1 numbers.
BULL13|But looking forward, I think their new streaming service is going to be very, very interesting.
NEUT14|So Disney has an enormous amount of content and in the streaming business, having content is King and the ability to deliver that content.
NEUT15|I think if you if you looking at 4-5 years and you're looking for.
BULL16|Company with a long track record.
NEUT17|Very very, you know.
BULL18|I suppose very, very stable earnings over time.
BEAR19|That's kind of, I think, just been punished a little bit with with a little bit of bad news flow.
NEUT20|I think this potentially is a good time to start accumulating.
NEUT21|Yeah, and you will be hunkered down in our home is not going after watching things beam in just on that quickly.
NEUT22|I mean, the interesting reason or one of the reasons why I think it's being sold down so hard is that they had the CEO of effectively their resorts come over and.
NEUT23|Take over a CEO and I think the market was saying hold on a second.
NEUT24|I thought that was the legacy type of the business.
NEUT25|Where is the content guy?
NEUT26|Why is he not coming to the front?
NEUT27|It's an enormous part of the business, so that's it, you know.
NEUT28|Optics are not, very briefly, is some kind of old fashioned sort of pick.
NEUT29|Yes, strong solid dependent, so I think I'm just having a look at where there's value in the South African system at the moment.
NEUT30|You talk about defensive orientated quality companies that really have delivered and then those that have taken a significant blood bath of which someone is certainly one of those.
NEUT31|Those sort of companies so.
NEUT32|This was probably 94 and a couple of years ago.
BULL33|Granted, I think it got pushed up to those sort of valuations at that point.
BULL34|However, you know you know 1/3 of that and the company itself is probably got more diversified and has longer term better optionality for growth over the longer term.
NEUT35|So certainly I think very attractive.
NEUT36|These sort of levels.
BULL37|Yeah, OK Gary, thanks very much for joining us this evening at Gary Boisen's friends with Nick Rails from Ashburton Investments.
NEUT38|An additional back tomorrow to take more of your stock related questions.
NEUT39|"In the mean time, have a good evening."""
