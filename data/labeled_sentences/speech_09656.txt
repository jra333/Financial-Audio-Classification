NEUT0|"""Hi everyone and welcome to our channel and do another top things to know special before we start."
NEUT1|Like always would like to kindly invite you to go ahead and join our growing community and family by smashing dislike button subscribing to the channel and hitting the notification Bell Bottom.
NEUT2|As we all know this is absolutely important.
BEAR3|And the reason why is because crypto currencies are going like crazy over the past couple of years.
NEUT4|Currently is probably the best time to invest in cryptocurrencies ever, and that is why you obviously want to stay up to date with the latest updates and everything that is happening with the blockchain space and cryptocurrencies in general and therefore will let the YouTube algorithm now that you would like to receive such notifications.
NEUT5|From now on, when you're watching.
NEUT6|This video now let's go ahead and get started.
NEUT7|EOS, well, the sleeping giant that everyone has been waiting for a long time to wake up and see what is going to happen.
NEUT8|Currently sitting at two point almost $8 billion a valuation and with close to the same 24 hours volume as we all know your West was basically the largest ICO ever which continued for 12 months and they actually raised $4 billion and therefore.
BEAR9|Even the current market capitalization is very very very low.
BULL10|We saw how this token basically skyrocketed not long ago, and the price in 2018 reached $22.89.
NEUT11|Obviously over the time they have.
NEUT12|Created a really big community.
BULL13|They have a lot of developers and they're doing progress on a daily basis.
NEUT14|So what do we expect during the new upcoming season over the next 12-13 months?
BULL15|We expect that this capitalization will reach at least $50 billion, and this is even to put it on the safe side.
NEUT16|So this is about 20 X from now and this will put the price of the OS token at around.
NEUT17|50 to $60.00.
NEUT18|This is our price expectation.
NEUT19|It can go even further, but again, this will truly depend on how Bitcoin performs and what will be the new all time highs for the Bitcoin over the next couple of months.
NEUT20|Well, this is done only for entertainment and educational purposes.
NEUT21|You need to do all this.
NEUT22|We don't provide financial advice.
NEUT23|We wanted to let you know what is the potential price that this token can reach.
NEUT24|And this is, at least in our opinion, based on our understanding of the market.
NEUT25|Absolutely possible to happen.
NEUT26|And just before we end this video, we would like to kindly invite you to go ahead as much dislike, but subscribe to the channel.
