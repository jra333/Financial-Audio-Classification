BEAR0|"""General Motors just released their fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday and absolutely blew out Wall Street's earnings."
NEUT1|But believe it or not, that's actually not a good thing.
NEUT2|And here's why.
BEAR3|Because of the world wide shut down last year.
BEAR4|With the pandemic automakers cut back on ship orders early last year in anticipation that they would have a very slow year because GM and other automakers stop buying US made chips as they normally do, there is now a surplus of chips on the market.
NEUT5|The electronic manufacturers quickly started to scoop up the excess supply of chips, but.
NEUT6|When car sales bounced back last year, it now left GM as well as the rest of the automaker industry.
BEAR7|With a chip shortage, automakers and parts suppliers were actually warning of the shortage in late last year after they saw the demand for vehicles rebounds more strongly than they had anticipated.
BEAR8|GM announced they've already temporarily closed their plants in Kansas, Canada, and Mexico due to the chip shortage.
NEUT9|This technically was a scheduled shutdown, but it wasn't supposed to be shut down for this long.
BEAR10|They said that they will most likely have these plants closed until mid March.
NEUT11|GM also announced in their fourth quarter earnings that they would love if you liked this video for the YouTube algorithm.
BEAR12|GM also disclosed on Wednesday in their earnings report that the chip shortage would trim 1.5 to $2 billion off of their 2021 earnings, even though it expects to maintain production of its best selling most profitable vehicles.
BEAR13|Shares of GM dropped 5% in premarket trading after they disclosed the chip shortage, whereas shares had been up 10% in the past week and a half since they disclosed that their goal is to be.
NEUT14|Emission free by 2035.
BEAR15|Even last week, GM's rival Ford said that its first quarter production will be cut by anywhere between 10 to 20% due to the chip shortage, and if that extends into the second quarter for Ford, they could lose anywhere between one to two and a half billion dollars in 2021.
NEUT16|So this isn't just a GM problem.
BULL17|This is an entire automaker industry problem, but I guess to get back to some good news about GM is that they did, and the fourth quarter with increased sales in their two largest markets, which would be China and the United States.
NEUT18|If we want to look at the analysts ratings from three months ago, they actually are.
BULL19|Pretty bullish with 13 buys and three holes with the overall consensus being a buy.
NEUT20|And if we look at the current analysts ratings, there's 15 buys and two holds with the consensus still being a by overall in stock.
NEUT21|So it seems like analysts like this stock the average price target for GM is around $61.00 and the current stock price around the time of this video is around $54.00.
NEUT22|So according to analysts, it has room to run the highest price target is $80.00 while the lowest target is $50.
NEUT23|And if we wanted to look at the six month chart, you can see that it's.
BULL24|Up 92% in the past six months, whereas the past 12 months, it's only up 56%.
BEAR25|So at the end of the day, GM absolutely blew out Wall Street's estimates for their fourth quarter earnings.
BEAR26|However, we learned that that was almost like the worst case scenario because they pretty much told us that they will now be struggling to keep up with demand due to the chip shortage moving forward.
NEUT27|Is this just a short term problem or it could this be a couple year fix?
NEUT28|GM has also talked about the plans that they have for 2035 by.
NEUT29|Only selling emission free vehicles, so it looks like they're trying to go in the right direction, and if you're out there watching this video, thinking that it might be the next Tesla, I don't know about that.
NEUT30|But with what GM is doing in order to position itself for the future, it looks like they will still be here in the future, and that's obviously the most important part.
NEUT31|Are you concerned about the chip shortage and not even for GM?
NEUT32|Like if you have exposure to any other automaker stocks, this technically concerns them as well.
