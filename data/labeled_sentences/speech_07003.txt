NEUT1|Not surprisingly, Buffett advises investors to continue to look at stocks with a long term mentality.
NEUT2|In a nutshell, Buffett's philosophy is that as companies retain earnings and reinvest in themselves, stocks will intrinsically become more valuable overtime.
NEUT3|If you own a business and you plow back a good portion of your earnings into building the business, you're going to have something more valuable on average year after year, Buffett said.
BULL4|As a result, the stock market builds in underlying value from year to year, although stock prices can be rather volatile.
NEUT5|Despite the market's high valuations, Buffett said that Berkshire is actively buying stock right now.
NEUT6|We are buying stock this morning, Buffett revealed.
NEUT7|However, Buffett doesn't necessarily think that the stocks he's buying right now will go straight up overtime.
NEUT8|I'm buying stocks, but I'm not buying them because I think they're going to go up next year.
NEUT9|I'm buying them because I think they'll be worth quite a bit more money 10 or 20 years from now.
NEUT10|Buffett reiterated the idea that stocks remained the best asset class to put your money in.
NEUT11|If your goal is achieving strong long term returns.
NEUT12|When asked if stocks were expensive at the current prices, Buffett said that if the stock market is considerably more attractive than fixed income securities.
NEUT13|And it's not hard to see why Buffett feels this way.
BULL14|Including dividends, the S&P 500 has generated annualized total returns of nearly 10% over long periods of time, compared with an average of about 4% for bonds.
NEUT15|Furthermore, consider some of the other expensive times to buy stocks in recent history.
NEUT16|If you had bought an S&P 500 index fund at the markets 2000 peakbeforethe.com bust, you'd be sitting on a total return of about 180% today, about 6% annualized.
NEUT17|And if you had invested at the markets 2007 highs before the financial crisis hit, you'd have a 142% total return, now, 8.4% annualized.
BULL18|While I wouldn't call these stellar returns, the point is that even if you invest at the worst possible times, stuck still outperform fixed income investments over the long run.
NEUT19|In other words, even if it's not an ideal entry point right now, and it's easy to make the case that it's not investors who are in the market for the long haul will do just fine.
