NEUT0|"""Alan uses emerged in the past few days that the Saudis could be poised to sell shares in Saudi Aramco."
NEUT1|The state owned oil company.
NEUT2|This is a prospect that will surely have every investment banker in the world salivating.
NEUT3|But how on Earth do you value such a gigantic and complex company and what indeed might it be worth?
NEUT4|OK, well there are a lot of unknowns here.
NEUT5|First of all, what we do know orally, so they're giving us is the reserves the company has about 260 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
NEUT6|They also have some natural gas which adds up to another in a 40 billion or so.
NEUT7|So there is a lot of the valuation will be there.
NEUT8|I've looked at other state oil companies say Pemex, which is also private and I not listed on any equity market and sprawling with all sorts of different assets.
NEUT9|I would say that looking at that, looking at a Ross Neft, another state on the company, and others like Petro China, probably were looking at closer to $10.
NEUT10|Maybe $8.00 per barrel, so that's the value of the reserves in the ground present value obviously reserves they production costs will be very low.
NEUT11|So what does that translate to in terms of an equity value for the whole company?
NEUT12|I would say somewhere including the refining assets that they have both domestic and overseas worth.
NEUT13|Probably well would take the whole thing to probably around 2.42 point, $5 trillion.
BULL14|OK, so that is about eight times the market cap of, say, Exxon Mobil, which is the biggest publicly traded oil company in the world.
NEUT15|Is there an exchange in the world that is big enough to take even a sliver of that equity?
NEUT16|It's a fair question because the Saudi market has a market capitalization of less than 400 billion.
BEAR17|As you can see, even a 10th 15th of Saudi ramco would eat up a lot of that, so it's not going to fit there.
NEUT18|And it is.
NEUT19|A qualitative issue on the valuation, because if it's going to be listed in the US or London, an investors demand even more information than the Kingdom wants to give about how ramco's doing and the oil reserves and things that might actually put a discount on the 8 to $10 per barrel valuation that I gave you.
NEUT20|OK, so even if a ramco doesn't float, we can look forward perhaps to learning a lot more about how the company actually works, Alan.
BULL21|"Thanks very much."""
