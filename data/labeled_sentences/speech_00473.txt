NEUT0|"""I'm back here in the US."
NEUT1|We are watching a number of earnings reports.
BULL2|It's amazing that with everything else that's going on, yes there are still some companies that are reporting earnings, and we've gotten some very interesting numbers.
NEUT3|Indeed, I'm just checking on the shares of Square.
BULL4|They're up by 7% today and square has sort of tide its fortunes to crypto currency to Bitcoin.
BULL5|And it's actually worked out pretty well for it thus far.
NEUT6|It's cash app generated just over $2 billion last quarter, that was.
NEUT7|Mostly from Bitcoin transactions and then of course the company invested directly in Bitcoin as well.
BEAR8|In October, $50 million worth of Bitcoin in October as we know it is gone up.
NEUT9|So that has proven at least as far to be a smart investment miles, you know, it's interesting because you don't.
NEUT10|I mean, you don't.
NEUT11|You think of Square isn't as a crypto company?
NEUT12|Is it a crypto company now?
NEUT13|I mean, I think it has to be.
NEUT14|I'm looking at the breakdown here from from the you know from the statement, because revenue 1.6 billion in the last quarter, that's half of more than half of the companies.
NEUT15|Entire revenue and all that revenue, including the Bitcoin part of it, was 140% in the third quarter, and this is for a business that yes, it's growing and I think it has a lot of tailwinds behind it in terms of how you know businesses want to run their point of sale and so on.
NEUT16|They got square capital going on all that's very exciting X the Bitcoin part of it, but when half your revenue in the most recent quarter comes from that part of the business, you kind of have to say this is what we are, and I think investors have reason to love that I mean.
NEUT17|Profits for the company or through the roof as well, because that's going to be a high margin business of essentially being a custodian for cryptocurrency.
NEUT18|You look here at their adjusted EBIT $181 million.
BULL19|That's up $50 million from last year, and if you look at the adjusted or their gross profit out of the cash app part of the business, it's almost up 3X from where it was in the same quarter last year.
NEUT20|So when those are the results that are coming from your crypto pivot and then the stock is up against 6%, I mean it's $44 stock in March.
NEUT21|$188.00 stock so I guess everyone goes home happy.
NEUT22|I mean for now Miles as we know bitcoins a little volatile, so we'll see if it can maintain these games and what that's going to mean for square when you when you tie your fortunes, there's the upside and the potential downside.
BEAR23|Let's quickly look at Roku as well, because that company blew away estimates for revenue reported an unexpected profit.
NEUT24|Brian sozzi.
NEUT25|You've been looking at those Roku numbers.
NEUT26|Yeah, Julie.
NEUT27|Only numbers you.
NEUT28|Anyone should care about on Roku.
BULL29|One average revenue per user, up 20%.
NEUT30|Adjusted operating profits 12 and a half million this year.
BEAR31|Slight loss.
NEUT32|Last year bomb on a Roku $30 billion market cap and they're finally starting to grow into it because we're all home and we're all watching Yahoo Finance on Roku TV.
NEUT33|I guess we are.
BULL34|"Those shares are 8% today by the way."""
