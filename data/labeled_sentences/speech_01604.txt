NEUT7|On September 11th?
BEAR8|The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg came out with an article about China shutting down Bitcoin exchanges, but they had unnamed sources in all the major exchanges in China said they've heard nothing of it.
BEAR9|And then on September 12, Jamie Dimon comes out and says that Bitcoin is a fraud and that any traders that are called buying or trading Bitcoin would be fired.
NEUT10|Now, why would these this old media, the bankers old corporate centralized system, do this?
NEUT11|Because they fear Bitcoin?
