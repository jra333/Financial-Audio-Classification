BULL0|"""They toughly worded statement now from Amazon Web Services this responding to the Pentagon, which earlier today suggested that it favored Microsoft for this massive $10 billion Jedi contract on cloud computing."
BEAR1|Amazon Web Services now responding to that statement from the Pentagon accusing the president of blatant cronyism.
NEUT2|Here the statement going on to say that the president is making simply making the wrong decision.
NEUT3|Ultimately, Amazon suggesting that this is.
NEUT4|Nothing more than an attempt to validate a flawed, biased and politically corrupted decision.
BULL5|So some very strong words from Amazon.
BEAR6|There is an ongoing court battle about all this.
BEAR7|It's clear that this is not going to be resolved today, but this fight goes on and the rhetoric here very heated between these two companies Melissa, back over here seems like it might not even be resolved by the election.
BEAR8|I only bring that up because obviously there is some bad blood between President Trump and Jeff Bezos.
NEUT9|Yeah, that's right.
NEUT10|I mean, Amazon has suggested that the reason the President wants Microsoft to get this contract and not Amazon is because Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, which the president has said is biased against the president.
NEUT11|So they're saying that this is political corruption of the highest order.
NEUT12|This statement by Amazon that just came out moments ago is.
NEUT13|I mean, I've rarely seen anything like this.
NEUT14|I mean, this is a very lengthy statement from one of the nation's biggest and most powerful companies lambasting the President of the United States as being part of.
NEUT15|Corrupt effort here to simply benefit himself personally and it lists example after example that Amazon feels is simply inappropriate by this administration.
BEAR16|"So some really tough language here."""
