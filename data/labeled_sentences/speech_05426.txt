BEAR0|"""Oil is headed dramatically lower since the start of 2016, losing almost 20% in just seven sessions."
BEAR1|That's been driven in part by continued concerns, leading all the way back to the middle of 2014 to currently about supply overtaking demand.

BEAR12|In an extreme scenario whereby either storage tanks become too full or currency movements lead to greater pressure coming on the oil price as a result of the strength in the dollar hitting all dollar priced commodities.
NEUT13|However, we may also start to see more.
BULL14|"Projects shutting in around level, which could provide a degree of stability for the price."""
