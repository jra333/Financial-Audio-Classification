NEUT0|"""IT form Hexaware Technologies Board has now approved the proposed delisting of the stock from the exchanges."
NEUT1|Let's do a 3 point analysis to really understand what is their rationale behind this move and how will it really impact the shareholders going forward one?
NEUT2|Why is the company delisting from exchanges?
NEUT3|And if you see Hexaware had announced in early June about its promoter bearing PH's intent to delist the company on June 12th the company appointed I CI CI Securities.
NEUT4|As merchant banker for delisting of the company from the stock exchanges and also to carry out due diligence processes going forward.
BULL5|Now the main objective of the delisting proposal was aboard the promoter and for the promoter group to really obtain full ownership of the company, which would in turn provide increased operational flexibility to support the company's business.
NEUT6|Two what does it mean for the company and for shareholders?
BULL7|Well, the delisting will help the company in cost savings and also allow the management to dedicate more time to focus on the companies.
NEUT8|Is going forward now.
NEUT9|The promoter has no immediate plans to sell its holding or even to merge the company with its other portfolio companies or affiliates.
NEUT10|Now bearing PE Asia hold 62.4% stake in Hexaware.
NEUT11|Now for the delisting which to succeed.
NEUT12|The promoter will have to reach the 90% shareholding threshold.
NEUT13|Also, if you see the indicated price offered by the company or the promoters is ₹285 per share.
BULL14|Now the reason that the stock has zoomed past its proposed delisting price is the optimism behind expectations that bearing PE backed.
NEUT15|Will revise the price upwards.
NEUT16|Also, the stock currently trades at ₹321 that is 13% above the indicated price 3 how long will the delisting process take while the board's approval is subject to consent of the shareholders?
BEAR17|Now if you see delisting in India is generally quite difficult with investors expecting a significant premium for the same now in many past instances also delisting bids have fallen through due to the mismatch between the investors expectations.
NEUT18|And the offers made by the promoters.
NEUT19|Now the last two IT services firms to delist were polarised consulting in 2018, and Putney computers in 2012.
BEAR20|Both the firms had to pay more than 30% of premium to the delisting floor price that they had said.
NEUT21|If one were to extrapolate similar trends for Hexaware.
NEUT22|Also, the exit price could be in the range of ₹350 to ₹365 per share.
BULL23|Now Emkay global financial Services in a note has also said that we see a strong.
BULL24|Likelihood of a hike in the offer price on account of much higher valuation multiples according to recent buyouts by strategic and financial investors.
NEUT25|Relative valuation.
BULL26|Discount for hexaware at the offer price when you compare it to the peers and past presidents wherein offer prices have seen significant upward revisions as well.
BULL27|Now, Sebi has streamlined the delisting process which actually makes it slightly easier for the promoter.
NEUT28|However, experts feel in an event.
NEUT29|The delisting bid is unsuccessful.
NEUT30|The stock could actually see.
BEAR31|"A major correction."""
