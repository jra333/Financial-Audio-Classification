NEUT0|"""What's going on YouTube Nation."
NEUT1|I'm just giving a response to a article that I read and I can confirm this is true.
NEUT2|It was on Motley Fool.
NEUT3|They discuss three companies that use our products every day.
NEUT4|The three of them were, you know, ever McCormick an Pfizer.
NEUT5|So I just looked around my apartment complex, see if I had any McCormick or Pfizer or Yuna lever products.
BULL6|And yeah, they were definitely correct.
NEUT7|Here's one with McCormick.
NEUT8|OK, that's always a hot stock.
NEUT9|I'm planning on investing in them.
NEUT10|Here's another one centrum everybody takes centrum, so that's Pfizer Chapstick.
NEUT11|Pfizer OK, you know ever OK Suave, a product sunal ever OK. Another swab.
NEUT12|It acts as Yuna Lever.
NEUT13|So that's one of the reasons why I invested in Pfizer as well as Yuna Lever because their products are everywhere.
NEUT14|One hand I can give you with investing and when it comes to investing.
NEUT15|Is go to the store, look at some of the products that you buy and look at the companies that own AM and immediately look at the company's stock.
NEUT16|That's what attracted me to Yuna.
NEUT17|Lever right away and that's where I knew about Yuna.
NEUT18|Lever in their products.
NEUT19|So I became attracted an I invested in them again.
BULL20|I'm not an accredited investor, but it really helped me with my M1 finance portfolio to grow a dividend portfolio as well as Pfizer because every I read some articles on Pfizer and I was like, yeah?
NEUT21|OK, we'll see how it looks, but look at how many things are on the shelves and Mccormick's another one.
NEUT22|I mean McCormick.
NEUT23|I probably will add on my.
NEUT24|M1 finance portfolio.
NEUT25|Once I get to around $15,000, I'm right around 3000.
BEAR26|I do plan on throwing in some money tomorrow, 'cause I hear the stocks are going down and I'm probably going to slash around My Portfolio a little bit because there's some stocks and I think have potential and their way down, and I'll probably Adam.
NEUT27|But that's something that.
NEUT28|Really attracted me to those two stocks and potentially three stocks in the future, so that's one of my tips how to find a good stock or a good product.
NEUT29|Is is it in demand?
NEUT30|Absolutely, Chapstick is in the winter.
NEUT31|Everybody needs vitamins.
NEUT32|They take centrum.
NEUT33|Everybody needs body wash stuff and I can tell you this stuff is ocean breeze.
NEUT34|This is cheap on the shelves, so if you want to live frugal and spend frugally, this stuff is pretty cheap in the stores.
NEUT35|So I'm just letting you know this.
NEUT36|This one actually smells pretty good too.
NEUT37|Suave a.
NEUT38|What is it?
NEUT39|Refresh that's a flavor that one actually smells really good, and it's very cheap, and the soap section.
NEUT40|So that's one thing you want to want to look into as well as the shampoo products by Yuna Lever.
NEUT41|Fantastic, that's my honest response.
NEUT42|They're not very expensive, so that's just my two cents right there on a few stocks.
NEUT43|I'm going to post the article in my description.
NEUT44|On The Motley Fool article on it, just to make sure that it's that I'm legit and I know what I'm talking about and I'm backing up what I'm saying.
NEUT45|So that's my message.
NEUT46|Real quick.
BULL47|That's one tip to find a good stock and see if it's in demand and if everybody is using it alright, you guys have a good Sunday.
NEUT48|"I will be posting more videos of Sunday so have a good one."""
