NEUT0|"""Paul, I think a lot of people are asking about iRobot."
NEUT1|Do you want so?
NEUT2|I actually I wanted I, robot and the reason being is we had some people outside of our patrons and what they want to hear.
NEUT3|This.
NEUT4|I sold some iRobot puts yesterday $2.1 billion company PE of 14 so check Mark there.
BULL5|Very nice profit margin.
NEUT6|22.5 cents.
NEUT7|Seven check Mark there.
BULL8|Great how about revenue growth over the past five years, revenue growth 620,000,000 to 1.2 billion.
BULL9|Almost doubling, that's awesome.
NEUT10|Yeah, 24 profit, 85 check marks.
BULL11|They doubled their profit.
BEAR12|Nice how about number of shares outstanding pillar number five was going down 29.55 down to 28 but it went down to 27.727 point 627.7 then jumped up.
NEUT13|So take me check Mark but find out if there is an acquisition made here or something that caused him to issue more shares.
NEUT14|I don't know.
NEUT15|I don't like.
NEUT16|I don't like that, but we'll see current assets greater than current liabilities Plymouth through 65808 versus 265.
NEUT17|Wow wait wow.
NEUT18|OK so guys total liabilities 808 minus total liabilities of 335 that is $470 million more if you remember.
NEUT19|The company was 2.2 we gotta take out the .47 we're left with $1.73 billion for the company.
BEAR20|So now all the numbers are shifted down 20% so it goes from 15 P down to a 12 PE 'cause when you're buying the company now you're buying 800 million $1,000,000 in cash with only three $35 million in debt.
NEUT21|You're getting an extra $470,000,000, right then in there.
NEUT22|Do you follow what I'm saying here?
NEUT23|They have 470 in the bank, so if you buy the company for 2.2 they would net 470 the bank.
NEUT24|So if you buy for 2.2 you're actually paying 1.7 free cash flow pillar #7 Alright ready Seth.
NEUT25|See every time you ask me if I'm ready I gotta fire my phone up.
NEUT26|Go ahead and 16106 fifty three 3995.
NEUT27|They're all over the place, Yep.
BULL28|Average 62 OK this is a big increase in guys.
BEAR29|This is big time increasing if you just multiply it by 20 you get 1.2 billion and we needed a value of 1.7 after cash so it shows less than it should be.
NEUT30|That's 1.7 showing $1.2 billion is 20 times free cash flow.
NEUT31|But guys, I'm not exactly going to say that's right.
NEUT32|I actually wonder if it's still.
NEUT33|Let's see how they did the last 12 months.
BULL34|They probably jumped up a lot in last 12 months.
BULL35|Wow, last 12 months at 225 billion in free cash flow.
BULL36|Wow, they jumped up a lot during this downturn.
NEUT37|I sold out puts on iRobot number price by did sell AM.
NEUT38|I don't know why I'm against this company.
NEUT39|Even right now.
NEUT40|I mean if you believe the iRobot story so this is the caveat I'm saying.
NEUT41|If you believe I robot will be the leader or be a good company for a long period time and grow their revenue on these robotic vacuums and I don't see why is the bad by now.
NEUT42|Look at momentum.
NEUT43|OK, it just crossed over the turn day.
NEUT44|Just crossed over roughly here so it's a little bit down since you would have bought and look at this just to show how it can go up and down all the time.
NEUT45|You would have sold it right here.
NEUT46|"At roughly 63 and you bought back again at 75, so that just goes to show that the momentum thing has to be done consistently over long periods of time."""
