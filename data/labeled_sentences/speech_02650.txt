NEUT0|"""Launched in 2015, annual S&P 500 dividend futures allowed investors for the first time ever to see what market participants expected would happen to corporate cash flows in the future."
NEUT1|Since 2017, there have been eleven annual dividend futures contracts, one for the current year and one for each year.
NEUT2|In the subsequent decade.
BULL3|S&P 500 dividends grew by 40% in the 90s, another 40% in the 2000s and then 155% in the 20 teens.
BULL4|But pricing for the twenty 20s has never been so optimistic.
BEAR5|Currently, investors priced at the most likely scenario for dividends this decade is that they fall by 10% from their 2019 levels and then recover slowly, but that even by 2030 they still won't be back to last year's levels.
BULL6|By contrast, even in February, before the pandemic set in annual dividend futures priced only a 20% rise in dividends over the course of the twenty 20s.
NEUT7|So what happened?
BEAR8|How can stock prices have hit record highs this summer even as expected?
BEAR9|Dividend growth remains so modest.
NEUT10|Well, here's one possible answer.
NEUT11|If one sums up the eleven annual dividend futures contracts, one can estimate what investors think is the most likely amount of dividends to be paid over the next decade.
BEAR12|You might be surprised to see that the sum of the next 10 years worth of dividends is lower today than it was in 2017, even though the equity market is close to 50%.
NEUT13|Higher that might seem odd, but it's not too surprising when one remembers that the equity market in theory should be discounting future cash flows into present value when one takes the net present value or the NPV of future cash flows, one finds that between the beginning of 2017 in April 2020, the net present value of dividends and stock prices moved in lockstep.
BEAR14|How so it's simple bond yields fell as long term interest rates fell.
BULL15|That increase the net present value of future cash flows in the equity market, even if their nominal values didn't really change very much.
BEAR16|What this tells us is that the equity markets valuations may have already been dependent on long term interest rates remaining low even before central banks beginning new round of quantitative easing or QE this spring.
NEUT17|But look what happened next since April.
BULL18|Equity prices have risen even as the NPV of dividends is remained relatively stagnant.
BULL19|This may have occurred because of global QE, five major central banks, including the US Federal Reserve, expanded their balance sheets by buying bonds.
NEUT20|It was at this time that equities began soaring, even as the NPV of dividends stopped advancing.
BEAR21|The central banks began to slow their asset purchases over the summer, and equity seemed to have lost some of their upward momentum, at least for the moment.
NEUT22|In this raises the question for the world central bankers.
NEUT23|Did QE programs cause equities to rise above the value of cash flows, and if So what will central banks do if equity prices begin to fall back while they do further rounds of quantitative easing and risk sending stock prices even higher even further away from dividends?
BEAR24|Or would they allow equity prices to decline, potentially impacting consumer and business confidence?
