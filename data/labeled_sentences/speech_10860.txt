NEUT0|"""Guys this is your boy Jonathan."
BULL1|Welcome back today.
NEUT2|I want I'm going to talk about Microsoft.
NEUT3|Microsoft is a very good start, but I've been trading for a long time, so today we're going to make some analysis.
NEUT4|Concerning Microsoft for 2021 and likely Microsoft is going to keep going up, but not in the way that you guys think it, just that Microsoft is one of.
BEAR5|The big tech stocks that are that moves very slow, very slow.
BEAR6|You can get very bored watching Microsoft.
NEUT7|It is very slow, so Microsoft today is traded at 241.
NEUT8|This is a.
BULL9|This is a 4% and it adds to my cost of $9 today.
BULL10|Today is a very good day.
NEUT11|You know.
NEUT12|I'm very surprised.
BULL13|NASDAQ NASDAQ is is doing very well.
NEUT14|You know, I'm very surprised.
NEUT15|I thought I thought today the US economy was not going to the market.
NEUT16|the US market was not going to do very well, but I'm surprised everybody surprised and look at Microsoft.
NEUT17|Microsoft is flying.
NEUT18|See if you look at the one minute chart you see.
BEAR19|And this morning it took a dive to 232 and after that.
BEAR20|It just keep going up.
NEUT21|It just retracted a wound.
NEUT22|There are 1053 alright to 11 and then after that it keeps going up.
NEUT23|But actually when you go to.
NEUT24|When you go to the one year chart right and then you can see the pattern.
NEUT25|You see, if we take.
NEUT26|The pulling line and then we just trying to figure out you know what's the next.
NEUT27|What's the next step for Microsoft?
NEUT28|K. Alright.
NEUT29|K. Alright, so we can see that.
BEAR30|Alright, it's not going to keep going up.
NEUT31|It might my retraction or a little bit later on my.
NEUT32|Might do it.
NEUT33|Darling see my goes to 228.
NEUT34|My go to 228 to 2026 maybe next week and then maybe after that it can take a new high.
NEUT35|However, if the market is still troubled by.
BEAR36|Those Jimmy stock AMC with those ready traders going on thing you know that might week weekend the market and we don't want that so therefore.
NEUT37|If that doesn't happen.
NEUT38|If it doesn't happen so well, we'll likely see.
NEUT39|Like a like a higher high in Microsoft and it's a very good stocky if you guys don't want to invest in in quality stocks and Microsoft is one of them and.
NEUT40|So.
NEUT41|So that's it for today.
NEUT42|"Thank you very much, bye."""
