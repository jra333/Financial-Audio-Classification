NEUT0|"""Alright, so with the markets shuttered today, we decided to temporarily change our name to Countdown to the opening Bell."
NEUT1|Of course, Thursday morning we need to see will there be a continuation of yesterday's.
BEAR2|Sell off waterfall of S&P and Dow and NASDAQ and transport stocks.
BEAR3|It was an ugly day with a final loss of 799 points to the downside.
NEUT4|But will we see folks coming in and snapping up bargains we bring in Fairfax Global Markets CEO Paul Dietrich.
NEUT5|What do you anticipate?
BULL6|Well, the stock markets, futures all of them are up and so tomorrow ought to be a really good day, but I think it was good that we had a day off today in the markets because it allowed investors to step back.
NEUT7|And kind of take stock of what was going on and go back to economics 101 in the long term, the stock market already always always reflects the underlying economies direction and the underlying economy is going up.
NEUT8|You look at today's Beige Book that the government released.
BEAR9|There are a few small pockets of the economy like housing that are slowing growth the rest of the economy is booming wages, you know, shocked everyone how much they went up.
NEUT10|Well advise our viewers if you had a chance before that opening Bell or the minute the Bell opens, would you scoop up some names and if so which names are you looking at right now?
BEAR11|The market is undervalued.
NEUT12|If you look at the price earnings ratio, the forward price earnings ratio, it's under its five year long term trend.
NEUT13|We haven't seen that in eight years, but no, no.
NEUT14|The forward PE ratio today is 15.6 and the long term trend is 16.4.
NEUT15|But that's the trailing by see, but you can't.
NEUT16|Ever look at trailing PE ratios because it doesn't reflect the tax cuts because we're still showing pre tax cut years.
NEUT17|So you have to look at the forward peas.
BEAR18|It's undervalued.
NEUT19|There were so many big stocks.
BEAR20|Disney, AT&T, Verizon, all of these stocks are undervalued under there.
BULL21|The 16.4 long term trend on their forward PE's.
NEUT22|JP Morgan just downgraded Verizon.
NEUT23|You still sticking with them, right?
NEUT24|Yes, there this is a company that has an over 4% dividend yield.
NEUT25|Its got like a 12 PE.
BULL26|They have so much money they have a 78% return on equity.
NEUT27|They don't know what to do with their money.
NEUT28|They will start investing and when that happens you're going to see a really big pop.
NEUT29|All right, we've got about a minute left here, 45 seconds Capitol Hill there all descending.
NEUT30|Right now we can see the opening room there where we understand senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown are supposed to come out in just a moment to talk about their meeting with Mary.
NEUT31|Laura, your thoughts on that stock?
NEUT32|Well, that's a good question.
NEUT33|I think what the board is doing and what Mary Barra.
BEAR34|I know this is politically incorrect to say she's doing the right thing.
BEAR35|Their cars, some of their cars just weren't selling.
NEUT36|Nobody wanted to buy Chevy Cruze and some of these other things and they had to do what they were doing.
BULL37|So in the long run I think this is going to be good for General Motors and what the government is doing.
NEUT38|It may be good politically, but it's bad policy reason we're showing the the old video from 2008 where the three big automaker CEOs came before Congress.
NEUT39|With their hands out, their hats open saying give us money, that becomes the problem.
BULL40|Paul, thank you very much.
NEUT41|"Paul theatrix."""
