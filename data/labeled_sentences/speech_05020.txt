NEUT0|"""This is Alan Frog from FX empire."
BEAR1|Netflix stopped out after a strong rally right around the 4:20 level in 2018 and then sold off to about 2:50, grinding out this very large trading range.
NEUT2|Stocks spent all of 2019 oscillating back and forth within this large trading range, finally returning to 2018 resistance in the second quarter of 2020.
BULL3|Now consolidate are right across the breakout level and then took off in this rally.
NEUT4|There was 575 in July.
BEAR5|Company that warned about third quarter guidance, saying that it would only put less than 3,000,000 new subscribers on the books.
BULL6|Now that's the stock sold off after that found support right around the 50 day moving average and now it's starting to move higher again.
NEUT7|And folks are wondering if it's going to break out and take off.
BEAR8|But looking down on balance, volume accumulation topped out in 2018 and it's really done very little since that time.
BULL9|This tells us that this big rally was right.
BEAR10|Here was probably fueled mostly by short covering.
BULL11|Even so, I think the stock is well positioned to win much, much higher in the next few years.
BEAR12|Because older demographics who are stuck inside because of cover 19 are starting to buy into the service even though they're not as tech savvy as younger people.
BULL13|Now, this represents a real good growth opportunity.
BULL14|"I think Netflix will eventually break out and head toward the 1000 level, maybe in the next 6 to 12 months."""
