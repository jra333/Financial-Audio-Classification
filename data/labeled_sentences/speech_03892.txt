NEUT3|Sometimes it cannot be so easy to determine what stocks are worth buying.
NEUT4|There are over 5000 tradeable stocks on Robin Hood which gives a lot of opportunities for success as well As for failure.
NEUT5|These points I'm about to share can be used on other trading platforms.
NEUT6|However, I will be using Robin Hood to explain them as that is my personal brokerage.
NEUT7|Additionally, these points are focused more for long term growth and stocks rather than short term growth for short term gains.
NEUT8|I trade options.
NEUT9|However, when I buy stocks, they're usually for the long term.
NEUT10|Check out my channel to see more options.
NEUT11|Trading videos to start off.
NEUT12|The first point I check is to see if the stock pays out dividends.
NEUT13|Now if you are unfamiliar on what dividends are.
NEUT14|To put it simply, it is getting paid for just owning certain stocks.
NEUT15|Now these can be paid out monthly, quarterly or sometimes can be cancelled.
NEUT16|If times are tough for that specific stock or company.
NEUT17|You can find out if stocks pay dividends by using the Internet to look it up.
NEUT18|There are websites like David Datacom to see if the stock you would like to purchase pays dividends.
NEUT19|The second point I look for is how consistent the company pays out dividends.
NEUT20|I don't mean if it pays quarterly or monthly.
NEUT21|I am looking to see if this stock pays dividends without cancellations and their dividend payments.
NEUT22|Companies like Coca Cola, Johnson and Johnson and IBM are notorious dividend payers and have paid out very consistent dividends for decades now.
NEUT23|Do not be discouraged from holding non dividend paying stocks.
NEUT24|Tesla which has grown over 500% in the past year is a non dividend paying stock.
NEUT25|The Tesla stock I own however is the only non dividend paying stock in My Portfolio but I had previously owned stocks like GW Pharmaceuticals which is another non dividend paying stock.
NEUT26|The Third Point I look for in stocks is the one year an five year performance.
NEUT27|I typically try to purchase stocks that have at least 5% or higher growth per year.
NEUT28|I tend to focus more on the five year growth because I'm playing it long term and I use the one year chart to determine if it is a good time to purchase the stock.
NEUT29|I would suggest using great caution when buying stocks that have remained stagnant or negative in their five year chart on Robin Hood, the 4th point to look into is the background information and research on the stock you are planning to buy.
NEUT30|Know where you are putting your money.
NEUT31|Don't just give up your money so fast and right away.
BULL32|Take your time and do your research and you'll likely see better results in the long term.
NEUT33|The 5th and final point to look into is more of a personal feeling in question.
NEUT34|Are you comfortable holding this stock for one month?
NEUT35|One year, five years?
NEUT36|What about a decade?
NEUT37|If you aren't confident in a stock and don't feel comfortable putting your money into it, then just don't do it.
NEUT38|Even if everyone else is telling you to do it, it is just that simple.
NEUT39|Do only what you are comfortable with while investing.
NEUT40|Hopefully these quick points help you out when determining whether the stock you are looking to buy is worth the purchase now.
NEUT41|Just because the stock doesn't hit one or more of these points doesn't necessarily mean that the stock you are looking to purchase isn't a good.
NEUT42|By these are simply just some basic benchmarks or points I use when looking to buy stocks for the long term.
