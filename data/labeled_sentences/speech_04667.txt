BEAR0|"""Amazon is out with its earnings results."
NEUT1|Jerrod Blicker has those numbers.
BULL2|First shared, we got some big beats here, and the stock is up 1% in the postmark, and that's after being up 1 1/2% before the Bell.
BULL3|Today we see a third quarter net sales coming in at $96.1 billion, and that handily beats the estimates of $92.71 billion.
BULL4|That's for one quarter up, 37% year over year and EPS.
BULL5|An even bigger beat, $12.37 versus $7.55.
BULL6|And that's versus a year ago, $4.23.
BULL7|Basically tripling that EPS number from a year ago, third quarter, third quarter operating income $6.2 billion.
BULL8|That's up 96% year over year almost doubled.
NEUT9|Estimate was for 4.73 billion.
NEUT10|So on those headline numbers really knocking it out of the park just a few other tidbits here.
NEUT11|Operating margin 6.4% North American segment sales coming in at $59.4 billion and then their prime day, which they.
NEUT12|As we know, they moved into the month of October here that is being disclosed as having $3.5 billion in 3rd party sales.
NEUT13|So I don't believe we're going to.
NEUT14|I don't believe we're going to be getting the full effect of that until the following quarter, but interesting to know here.
BULL15|So big beats on both the top and bottom lines here.
NEUT16|Just looking for some other segment service sales $43.4 billion in revenue and international segment sales $25.17 billion here.
NEUT17|And guys just to jump in on Amazon in some ways we fully expected these kind of beats, right?
NEUT18|But the narrative has shifted during Covid, we've seen huge huge ecommerce urges, you know?
NEUT19|So in some ways, this is SOP for Amazon.
NEUT20|These kind of games.
BULL21|But at the same time we've seen huge gains for Best Buy Target on line.
NEUT22|Only retailers like Wayfair, Etsy, and what's interesting to me.
NEUT23|In this earnings press release, Bezos starts the whole letter by talking about Amazon, bringing its minimum wage two years ago, up to $15.00 an hour.
NEUT24|This time, challenges specifically.
NEUT25|Best Buy and Target to do the same.
NEUT26|And it's no surprise to name those two companies which have seen big big boosts during the pandemic.
NEUT27|Another one is Urban Outfitters, so many of these brick and mortar retailers, ****** Sporting Goods.
NEUT28|I could keep going have seen these huge surges in e-commerce so it's me.
NEUT29|The larger story here in Amazon is of course the biggest part of it, but now you're seeing other names that had previously not seen these surges.
NEUT30|The biggest story is the dramatic acceleration.
NEUT31|We're now going to see in what percentage of all US retail happens on line.
NEUT32|It has jumped and I don't think it's ever going to go back.
NEUT33|You know, certainly that was a big question.
NEUT34|"You're going into this just whether or not Amazon was going to live up to some of those expectations, and certainly looking at least at these numbers and also their fourth quarter guidance there exceeding the street expectation."""
