BULL0|"""This is great for people that watch charts 'cause this is a textbook key reversal day."
NEUT1|Yesterday it's a new yesterday, right?
BULL2|It opens it gaps higher at the open, makes a new high, then all of a sudden does a U turn and closes below the previous day's low and it's been verified.
NEUT3|Now is that is that what's going on today?
BULL4|Yes, and yesterday we had huge volume in this too.
NEUT5|Down today.
BEAR6|OK down 1% was down 2% earlier so we had huge volume in the stock means that a lot of people were looking at this pattern.
BEAR7|All it means is that you know it's it doesn't mean that the trend is is over, but now you just have to recognize that maybe the stock could go down.
NEUT8|There's this is a big one.
NEUT9|I mean affected.
BEAR10|Their Apple stock is just been, I think some distributors parabolic.
BULL11|I mean it is just been going up relentlessly and the company is doing well.
NEUT12|I mean, let's not kid ourselves.
NEUT13|But at some point you know it has to read out right?
NEUT14|And you know there has to be a little bit of something like this before a bigger thing can happen.
NEUT15|Yeah, so this doesn't mean a big thing is going to happen, like a big trend, but it does warn of it and warn that you know there's going to be a short term pause here.
NEUT16|It's this pattern has come up a couple times before and it's with Apple, right?
BULL17|And it has worked.
BULL18|So it has worked, but then resumed its gradual climb upward.
NEUT19|Yes, and now it's been parabolically upward, right?
BEAR20|I think the two of the two I saw in 2010 one caused a 6% drop.
BEAR21|Another cause of 10% drop so.
BEAR22|You know, and it did go back up again, but at least you know there's probably mirrored broader market declines as well.
NEUT23|At that time, right?
NEUT24|Or after earnings number or something like that, so I mean, it does warn that something could happen here.
NEUT25|Yeah, I mean, that's a good question.
NEUT26|How much does this tie into what's going on in the markets right now?
BEAR27|That is up today, but it's been a little weaker of late the last week or so.
BEAR28|It's really been kind of rough.
NEUT29|You see, that's the five year chart we're looking at there, and I might see one of those two couple of dips you were talking about their Tommy, I mean.
NEUT30|Is Apple.
NEUT31|Is Apple completely disassociated from the mark broader market, or can it actually?
NEUT32|Unbelievably, be affected by what goes on the rest of the world.
BEAR33|It has caused the S&P and the NASDAQ.
BULL34|Indexes do carry the Apple to make new highs recently, whereas the Dow, the Dow transports the Russell 2000.
BEAR35|They don't have Apple in it, and they've actually been trending slightly lower over the last couple of weeks, so we are starting to see signs that you know if it wasn't for Apple's big rally that the stock markets actually is showing signs of weakness.
BEAR36|So if Apple starts, if Apple doesn't go up, I mean that that overall weakness, it could start carry over into the NASDAQ and have actually have a bigger effect on the broad market.
BULL37|That's interesting, but so far it is able to disassociate itself from those broader market moves.
BULL38|It has been so far yes, and it's actually propelled some of the other indexes that you know that we see is.
NEUT39|I mean, do the charts you know you look at the tea leaves through the choice of the charts point in any direction, trying to lead you there a little bit.
BEAR40|That's the thing I'm you know, you start looking at the small caps in the transports and then they're showing signs of weakness right here.
NEUT41|You have to start at least taking a breather here and and let the market play itself out before you start getting back involved again.
BULL42|Yeah, so I think maybe a near term top yes.
NEUT43|So for this key reversal to be reversed you'd have to close above 5/26/29 is what you wrote today, right?
BEAR44|That's that was the all time high yesterday and as long as it can it can hover just below that level.
NEUT45|"I could just stick there and you know that shows that that bears are still involved, but once they close above that they just give up and they were backed up to new Heights again."""
