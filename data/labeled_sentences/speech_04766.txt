NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome back to another episode of I question Lunch Talk."
NEUT1|Of course, once again, if you guys are life with me just to take the check just pop by say hello and ask any questions along the way.
NEUT2|If any day and if you guys have any any questions just popping in chat right?
NEUT3|Just pop by and say hello?
NEUT4|OK so today we're going to talk a lot, talk a lot into this whole concept of cash.
NEUT5|Overvaluation, so before I begin, let me expand it a bit.
NEUT6|What US cash over valuation means so catch overvaluation.
NEUT7|Jess means that if you were to buy a property in this offer at, let's say $600,000, and the very same come valuation come back, let's say $500,000.
NEUT8|Basically what happens over here is that you need to top up the difference or 100 / 1000, 'cause when you talk about loan in terms of loan, no matter what Bank so deeply or banks or even he should be basically only lend you, let's say.
NEUT9|75% of all he should be going up to 90% up to valuation.
NEUT10|So in this sense in this scenario this is Moore's currently seen in the HDB space rather than private property space and explain them you a little bit more in detail.
NEUT11|When I move forward.
NEUT12|Yeah, so cash flow valuation as I mentioned is a lot more weight or cancellation.
NEUT13|Usually most of us are we talking about in the head should be spaced out OK and the key here is that you know what this news and it came out is that cash over valuation is once again spot like.
NEUT14|So let's explore that.
BULL15|This really mean for you guys as well.
BEAR16|So this article published on 4th April OK And basically saying that cash flow valuations back becauses rising of rising property demands drive resale prices up.
NEUT17|So along I think let me pull out, pull with you guys a few of the key point is that I'm going to discuss these few key pointers as well.
NEUT18|So one of the reason why they mentioned that.
NEUT19|Body visual public prices.
NEUT20|Continuity going up is due to a few reasons.
NEUT21|One reason is because of the fact that BTO got through the construction delays and I think the pandemic subete O construction phase now is getting longer and longer, so it used to be perhaps for years within time.
BEAR22|So coming now, the last data is around 5:00 to 6:00, so pretty much been delayed for a minimum of nine months and in my even deley longer as long as the pandemic persists because they still have to do work on safety sensing and so basically the indignation put lesser men.
BEAR23|I will, in a construction site, which means that it will be delayed because of these homebuyers.
NEUT24|Then basically would not want to wait so long for a video and therefore the chicken down to the resale market to then actually buy.
NEUT25|OK, I'll call the second factor, which here is that this occurred due to fear.
NEUT26|Ensure that property price for contumacy go up, so we are looking through this article.
NEUT27|I saw this one bottle case study is that this 66 year old retiree right exists so prices go up tremendously.
BEAR28|When he taught that actually prizes who actually draw instead during the pandemic, which is most of our reaction because doing any form of crisis we expect any form of asset to drop due to fear in the market.
NEUT29|However, the what happened was that the reverse happened, right?
NEUT30|So why was this retiree end up saying that you know instead of getting a discount, he actually paid $160,000 Cash Cash over valuation for his particular property in passeri, so it's actually participate $650,000.
NEUT31|Witches of above cash use of above elevation by $160,000.
NEUT32|So you do the math accordingly by revolution is $490,000.
NEUT33|That means he bought it for 50 committed by safety $1000 and he actually then this extra 160 grand.
NEUT34|Now as an investor let's look at it as an investor point of view.
NEUT35|Yeah's home by a point where you can do whatever you want.
NEUT36|I mean I mean I mean attendees or money.
NEUT37|You want to spend the way you want to do it?
NEUT38|I mean, you're retiring.
NEUT39|66 is all that's fine.
BULL40|Good for you.
NEUT41|Enjoy the home, beautiful Seaview and and then that can be a very nice retirement home.
NEUT42|However, we remember guys, I called you all about being an investor in making sure our money work very hard for us and as an investor, what kind?
NEUT43|What is my thoughts on this particular move so you think about it guys and $650,000 for pessaries HDB Seaview?
NEUT44|Even going to do random propertyguru searching passers for most of the executive condominiums over there.
NEUT45|That is now there is now past MLP, most of the two data entry beta.
NEUT46|Condos obviously the easys over there is only costing you only cost about 700 + K to educate each and most of those easy, because just for the fact that they possibly say many of the buildings are there.
NEUT47|So yeah, the the middle upper floor assume there's some former unblock view you tend to have at least a partial Seaview of oh OK, but at least partial Seaview itself.
NEUT48|So I think about you guys, seven, $50,000 for HDB valuation really comes back to you and say that you know it's only worth $49,000, but yet still choose appear.
NEUT49|Cash or villager $160,000, which means that you think will you stop up just a little bit more.
NEUT50|You able to go private and therefore you think about it.
NEUT51|I mean, as an investor will go for the easy over this, HDB anytime.
NEUT52|I'll still get and not to mention that I still get the facilities and everything that moves.
NEUT53|Condominiums get.
NEUT54|So in this scenario as a investment itself, I will have to read it like 0 out of 10, right?
NEUT55|Because at the home buyer I mean whatever, as long as you're happy that's fine.
NEUT56|OK, so the keyword here is, that is it.
NEUT57|Wolf even paying cash over valuation.
NEUT58|My thought process is this.
NEUT59|No, my thought is that it's never worth it to pay cash over valuation.
NEUT60|At most you want concept being cash over valuation, maybe 10,000 best because the logic is this because if you are able to come up with so much cash over valuation you think about it guys you have so much character overcame overvaluation.
NEUT61|The buy into a property you requires, you can get 75% loan or 25% down payment, which means that all which if you have really been working consistently.
NEUT62|Last I see, 15 years, 1015 years.
NEUT63|So you have accumulated X amount of CPF, especially if your husband and wife people has always been working.
NEUT64|So now, in this scenario, think about it guys.
NEUT65|The test is needed to buy a property.
NEUT66|In this scenario, will only be 5% and therefore, and therefore for people who are able to come out so much cash to buy HDB by writer.
BULL67|I would also be pretty confident that this type of poor bias will also be able to easily afford private property where we are not ready very limited.
NEUT68|Into this whole concept of valuation not matching in terms of what the purchase price is to be so this is something that is happening very heavily more into his should be space, but I wanted you guys you want to put it out.
NEUT69|There is button for a good reason over here.
NEUT70|Why is it funny?
NEUT71|Good reason 'cause if you price keep going higher and higher higher just becomes very very pretty much less affordable for our next generation to purchase right?
NEUT72|So in this scenario until money is a good thing for it to.
NEUT73|Medication to constantly be, you know, we control certain extent by the government so that housing stays affordable.
NEUT74|So in that scenario, if you think about it for that context right then, of course I said investor as a home buyer is great by the investor, then that might not be the most profitable route for you.
NEUT75|If you want to retain in terms of your retirement some retirement when you want to sell it in future, or even as a legacy product if you don't pass it on to your kids in future because the valuation is pretty much already determines.
NEUT76|And really, without most of the buyers, why?
NEUT77|Who wants to pay a cash above valuation for that particle properties?
NEUT78|So overall, in HB perspective, I highly encourage you guys to really pretty much at the more balanced viewpoint in a sense that do not come out too much cash over valuation, because think about it, every government releases that for $90,000 worth for the past three zone, right?
NEUT79|So at most you wanna buy it and you can buy like 500 K Five 10520 K but not to the point of being 600K.
NEUT80|50,000 cash over valuation over the valuation of yhe given.
NEUT81|So now even look at this in this perspective is that is that that cash involution can only be paid by cash and therefore of course cash is King of Kashmir.
NEUT82|We used to actually be invested into many other investment asset class as well.
NEUT83|So what does this really mean for you as a buyer?
NEUT84|Will price continuously rise?
NEUT85|So let's take.
NEUT86|Let's take a set as a sit back and let's analyze this whole thing first.
NEUT87|No, I understand in 20 years back, let's say the 97 crisis, the global financial crisis is what we see.
NEUT88|Prices tumble down pretty drastically, but let's let's, let's really, let's look at it, or the more logical POV today.
BEAR89|Real prices continuously rise of crisis as she crashed the whole property market.
NEUT90|Now if there wasn't any cooling measures in place, cooling measures being order ABSD came in, or the TDs are measures that came in.
NEUT91|If there wasn't such measures came in.
NEUT92|I would say that the property price would be pretty much very in horse.
NEUT93|Singapore will be very not control in that scenario.
NEUT94|In this email then or cost price would have been much higher than it was when it supposed to be today.
BEAR95|So because of that, then yes, there is a risk of actually crashing down if is uncontrolled market.
NEUT96|But you must understand this one thing that Singapore is very good in terms of the fact that is trying to control the increasing public price through cooling measures.
NEUT97|And of course in this narrow on HB perspective.
NEUT98|Issue a valuation set by the government.
NEUT99|So in that scenario, expecting the public price will crash down like 1997 crises, right?
NEUT100|I will say that this is something that is is pretty much will probably not happen 'cause prices in this scenario, government and just actually release one of the 10 cooling measures an you aspect price would then shoot up for the dramatically there has really been proven ever since the one hitting a measure.
NEUT101|Just a couple of years back and pray that she went back up quite dramatically, right?
NEUT102|So in this scenario, I would say that there's a lot of measures for government to then take a step back to release all these cooling measures to give a heating measure to them.
NEUT103|So bring the puppy market back to what it was supposed to be already.
NEUT104|So in essence we cannot.
NEUT105|Then expert on the head of a 97 crisis in two days scenario as well and therefore do they to me is Singapore Market is a very new norm, is a very it's a new era itself and we need to.
NEUT106|We need to understand that.
BULL107|Property price today is pretty control in terms of the increase and also in the depreciation as well now.
NEUT108|Then come down the flip side, right is that will then price prices keep continuously to right side.
NEUT109|Will they continuously rice?
NEUT110|So in this scenario again once again I will say no because the number of bias and the number of buyers are there is willing to pay this high cash over valuation is always limited because in this scenario you must understand.
BULL111|Once again when someone is able to able to come out $100,000 cash over valuation, they would easily be able to afford a private property as well and therefore guys.
NEUT112|And therefore if you think about it.
NEUT113|Because the buyer pool is the same between the private properties and the HB.
NEUT114|Most of the time I would say that most buyers who then choose to go to a private property space rather than then, so high cash for this HP to pay these high cash over valuation so.
NEUT115|Coming into in some ways, this is that will.
NEUT116|It comes.
NEUT117|I mean it comes back down to do my or this whole topic or is that is casual version?
NEUT118|Is it here to stay my things that he will slowly died out?
NEUT119|I don't know, especially now we are at the vaccinations phase of the whole pandemic situation, right?
NEUT120|The market sentiment and fear sentiment.
BEAR121|Now it's this is really pretty much coming down in terms of the fear sentiment and therefore we can expect that the casual valuation.
NEUT122|In this scenario will also then slowly die down by 'cause.
NEUT123|As I said, two core reason number one is something that we can control because video construction is going to be delayed.
NEUT124|Delator and therefore more people going to resale market but must have people go to recent market.
BEAR125|Most of them will do not want to pay such high cash over valuation and #2.
NEUT126|Which will it be.
BULL127|Hard drives up.
BULL128|The main reason for higher cash flow valuation.
NEUT129|People willing pay $100,000 cash ovation, usually based on more fear factor that they think that price is going to continuously go up or they think that this unit is something that's so hard to the point where where everyone's going to beat them.
NEUT130|So it's a lot.
NEUT131|A lot of times it comes down to fear factor or very.
NEUT132|Emotional factor of West Valley.
NEUT133|Love this unit and they don't care how much money they spend it.
NEUT134|So in this near the number of buyers in this market space is usually very small and therefore this is I. I personally feel that it's not going to continuously happen where cash mobile value is going to be going on.
NEUT135|50,000, sixty 1070 thousand and above right.
BULL136|But you still always a normal is normal scenario for people to pay 10,020 thousand maximum cash over valuation on HBI think that's still OK, there's still decent but expected.
NEUT137|100,000 over dollar cash value is something that I personally would likely not happen.
NEUT138|OK, so if these guys we have only questions do just posting the check OK and we just reply them.
NEUT139|Of course even if you live or not live, you just reply when we can.
NEUT140|OK so in this email 'cause once again do feel free and I would encourage every single one you guys and then also subscribe to our Facebook Subtract YouTube channel, give us give us a time's up for this particular video.
NEUT141|OK so that we can just share you more opinions and thoughts.
NEUT142|Investor point of view.
NEUT143|OK an.
NEUT144|I mean you guys have a homeowner home by itself, then 'cause then it would be nice to have a little bit of a hybrid in the sense to.
NEUT145|Then of course I mean no one, no one.
NEUT146|No one says that you cannot be a homeowner at the same time.
NEUT147|Be investor as well, so it sometimes you want to have hybrid strategy.
NEUT148|Ensure that a home that you stay in at least two increases in value over time or in the worst case scenario at least use stay in value over time as well.
BULL149|OK so with this guys as usual impressive.
NEUT150|And if you have any questions, give posting a chat and I'll see you guys next week.
NEUT151|See you.
