BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking bout Clean Spark ticker symbol CLSK I'll be talking about the price action that we saw today along with the news and then at the end of the video I'll give my price predictions on the stock.
NEUT2|So stick around.
NEUT3|But before I get into the video, make sure it's subscribe button.
NEUT4|Keep up the daily videos and check out the links in the description to join the Patreon in the Discord look at the stock today.
BEAR5|The stock was down about 22% at the closing Bell to a price of $22.68.
BEAR6|The stock had a low on the day of $22.00 and the current price is $22.88 in the after hours.
BEAR7|So let's take a look at the news to see why we dropped so much today.
NEUT8|On Monday night, the company announced it would be selling 9 million shares that they hope to close is offering by March 18th.
BEAR9|So this triggered a bit of a sell off in the after hours last night.
BEAR10|But at that time we didn't know the exact pricing, so we dropped about 10% in the after hours last night.
BEAR11|So then this morning we found out that they were selling these shares at $22.00 a share and we actually dropped all the way down to a low price of $22.00 today.
NEUT12|Now there is some other factors to take into consideration with the price right now, although the share offering was definitely the biggest factor in this.
BEAR13|So the company is also still facing a lawsuit which could have a little bit of an impact on the price.
BEAR14|So this lawsuit was announced after a claim of a violation of the Federal Securities Law, which is filed against Clean Spark and its executives.
NEUT15|This all started back on January 14th when an analyst from Culper Research published a report titled Clean Spark back to the Trash Can and in the report culture allege that Clean Spark is an insider scheme.
BEAR16|Cooper also claimed that clean Sparks entire business has been created in lies and deceit, so this sounds like the typical short seller article and it seemed to have worked for them because when the report initially came out, the stock dropped about 9% that day.
BEAR17|The lawsuit against Clean Spark alleges that the company misled the investors.
NEUT18|Now companies get lawsuits all the time and this is just another scenario that doesn't concern me.
NEUT19|Personally I bought the dip today and I'm playing the whole for the long run as I believe this stock is a lot of potential.
BULL20|I see this offering is great buying opportunity and also see as beneficial for the company to obtain some cash that they can grow quicker.
BULL21|The stock still has an analyst price target of $47.50 by the end of the year, which leaves a great deal of room for some potential gains.
BEAR22|In my opening, this company is great 'cause I love the sector that they're in and the cherry on top of it all is that they mined Bitcoin, which is huge in my opinion and I think this might be an unpopular opinion, but I think the timing for this was perfect because the markets been overall down in this sector along with the Bitcoin dip.
NEUT23|So I think that time this perfectly to take advantage get this offering completed.
NEUT24|Get the money and take advantage of bitcoins rising prices.
NEUT25|So I see the stock is a long term hold.
NEUT26|And looking at the current price of the stock, I don't think you can go wrong with at least considering adding this to your portfolio.
NEUT27|So right after share offerings is one of my favorite times to buy into a stock because you're getting a sale price on a company that's obtaining money that's looking to grow and typically once they obtain this money.
BULL28|It gives him the ability to grow and we reached new all time highs.
NEUT29|So really I always like to buy in right after share offerings.
NEUT30|'cause it's almost like getting.
BULL31|Like the company on sale and it's going to all time highs again.
BULL32|So I'm actually very happy with the move that they decided to do.
NEUT33|And as far as my price predictions go for the end of the year, I think we'll see the stock at around $55.
NEUT34|And then if you want to look for the short term, I look for the stock to bounce back after the confirmation of the offering closing to around 25 to $28.00 within a few weeks.
NEUT35|But what do you guys think about the stock?
