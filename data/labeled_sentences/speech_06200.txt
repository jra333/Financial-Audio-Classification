NEUT0|"""It's claimed the speed video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Do this analysis previously so that is where the red and green lines are coming from, but it was such a rough day here for Amazon that I'm actually just going to delete all these lines out.
NEUT5|Sure they still pertain, they're just not relevant right now from a presentation standpoint.
NEUT6|I don't want to risk causing clutter confusion 'cause there's lines are really long, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible.
NEUT7|Yeah, there's no reason to sugarcoat it.
BEAR8|A very, very brutal day for Amazon here.
NEUT9|Now as far as levels to watch moving forward, let's first start off with levels of resistance, so if there is any sort of attempted bounce back to the upside first level resistance, watch closely going to be right there at.
NEUT10|The $3050 mark.
NEUT11|So 3050.
NEUT12|That first key battleground to watch if the price could push up through there for the next key, overarching level going to be right up there around the 3100 mark.
NEUT13|So 3050 and then 3100 going to be those two key battlegrounds to watch.
NEUT14|If they were like I said, if there is any sort of attempted.
NEUT15|Consolidation and then move it back to the upside will be interesting to see.
NEUT16|How does the price behave around each of these levels?
NEUT17|So that will be the assuming you care bout resistance levels, that's going to be the levels to watch.
NEUT18|Now what about areas of support?
NEUT19|Well, were some next potential balance areas.
NEUT20|And as you see here, I'm scrunching the chart down quite a bit because it has been a long time since the price have been down this low, But the next key level of support?
NEUT21|Is going to be right here at what is that the 3000 Mark, which would make sense the big old round Number and you can see back here that is essentially now do I mean 3000 to the T?
NEUT22|Actually in this situation maybe, but I mean give or take a few bucks.
NEUT23|I mean, we're talking about $3000 talk here.
NEUT24|But point being that is right where the price found support last time.
NEUT25|And that doesn't mean it's going to go down there.
NEUT26|But it's certainly you know, definitely within striking distance right now.
NEUT27|But those are going to be certainly the main technical levels to watch from both the support and resistance.
NEUT28|You know, side of things moving into next week, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird.
NEUT34|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT35|But in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
