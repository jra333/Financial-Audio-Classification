NEUT0|"""So you've got an extra $100 laying around."
NEUT1|You've built up an emergency fund and can provide for all your basic needs today, so now it's time to invest for the future.
NEUT2|While very few people are going to retire off $100, investment investing is a journey and as the ancient Chinese proverb says, a journey of 1000 miles begins with a single step.
NEUT3|You've already taken your very first step that's saving $100 savings.
NEUT4|Are the fuel that feeds your investing engine?
NEUT5|Make a savings plan to make sure you'll be able to continuously invest month after month and year after year.
NEUT6|You can even set up your bank account to automatically put aside a set amount every week or month to help.
NEUT7|Next you need to sign up for a brokerage account when choosing a brokerage.
NEUT8|Be mindful of commissions and fees while being aware of fees is important for all investors.
NEUT9|It's even more important for investor buying $100 at a time.
NEUT10|Many brokers will ask for $7.00 or $8.00 per transaction, and if you have to pay an $8.00 Commission every time you buy and sell an investment, you'll be 8% in the hole right off the bat and 16% in the hole.
NEUT11|If you have to take into account, the commissions will have to pay.
NEUT12|When you sell the investment.
NEUT13|As a result, you'll probably want to sign up with a discount brokerage, particularly ones that offer free trades once you've chosen a brokerage, it's time to make your first investment.
NEUT14|Now, with that first $100, you could go out and look for stocks that trade for less than $100 a share, but we would advise doing that if you were to do that.
NEUT15|The value of your whole portfolio would depend on the results of one company for just about every investor, an index fund or ETF is the perfect first purchase.
NEUT16|These investment vehicles allow instant diversification because they represent an ownership interest in.
NEUT17|All the stocks in the index that the fund tracks.
NEUT18|So instead of owning just one company, you own a teeny piece of hundreds or thousands of companies.
NEUT19|Further, these funds charge very low fees, so you get to keep as much of your returns as possible even if you don't get free trades at your brokerage.
NEUT20|Many brokers also allow unlimited free trades of select index funds and ETF's.
NEUT21|As for which ETF's to buy.
NEUT22|If you can think of investing idea or theme, there's probably an ETF for it.
NEUT23|There are tech centric ones, dividend focused ones, ones that own small companies.
NEUT24|And once again, big companies for new folks, we recommend starting out with an ETF that mirrors the S&P 500, such as Vanguard S&P 500 ETF video or the Spider SMP 500 ETF Trust SPY.
NEUT25|These ETS represent ownership in the S&P 500 Index composed of 500 of the largest U.S. companies.
NEUT26|Now astute investors may have looked up these tickers and realized wait a minute shares with these ETF's cost more than $100.
NEUT27|What am I supposed to do then?
NEUT28|Circling back to the point from the beginning of the video, investing is a long term thing.
NEUT29|The best thing you can do with $100 now is create a low fee or Commission free brokerage account.
NEUT30|Put the money in it and then put yourself in a position to add more money to that account over time.
NEUT31|Once you have enough saved, you can begin buying shares of quality.
NEUT32|Low fee ETF's.
BULL33|It may sound unsatisfying, but taking the Longview instead of just immediately buying shares of whatever stock happens to cost less than $100 will put you in a far better position.
NEUT34|1020 and 30 years from now, even after you've bought that first ETF.
NEUT35|Remember, this is not the end, this is the beginning.
BULL36|The beginning of an investing journey that will last a lifetime and hopefully make you smarter, happier and richer.
