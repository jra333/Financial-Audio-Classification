NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to this new supply demand and stock analysis for Chevron Corp ticker."
NEUT1|See the X this is it raining disclaimer you can pause the video and read it at any time.
NEUT2|OK, we're going to use.
NEUT3|The monthly timeframe.
NEUT4|This is a monthly training for CVS.
NEUT5|Several Corporation.
NEUT6|There is a very strong, very simple that became an aerial supply over there at around 100.
NEUT7|Six $17.00.
NEUT8|So there's a clear, clear show bias with a lot of willful price to keep on dropping.
BEAR9|The monthly timeframe is telling us that we have shared running a downtrend with light crude oil and Brandy.
BEAR10|Are oil futures dropping like a rock emanating areas of demand and creating years as a black clear downtrend on most world oil related companies like Chevron, BP, Chell all those microphone oil, Conoco Phillips and all that dropping like a rock only shorts are possible.
NEUT11|No need to pay attention to what the old pepper Russia ourselves.
NEUT12|We are deciding because fundamentals well are priced in and you already know what's happening.
NEUT13|If you take a look at the multi timeframe super strong areas of supply being created with that mess here in the left easily eliminated on the way down.
NEUT14|So sure bias on Chevron, you can use lower timeframe strategies.
NEUT15|This is so blind man can be used also in the lower time frames, but if you are using other strategies even using indicators which we don't need for.
NEUT16|Trading Salina money balances, you could use a smaller time frames like the one hour, 30 minutes, or even doing smaller timeframes to scalp CDX.
NEUT17|But sure bias no logs because the bigger pictures is bearish, so try to rule out the long positions on CBX becaused.
BEAR18|The bigger picture is bearish.
NEUT19|Remember that this is a single time frame analysis on the multi and single time frame is not enough to make a transition and this is not a signal service.
NEUT20|You must know when and when not to place a trade based on different plans and only after putting the analysis into context by doing a multiple time frame analysis.
