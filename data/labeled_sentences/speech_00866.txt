NEUT0|"""If I was a long term investor, meaning I could put some money into into something today, I'm not going to look at it for another frankly, five years, so let's just put covid aside, is this just an automatic upside bet at this point or not?"
NEUT1|Well, of course we're not allowed to say that, but what I will say is there is, I think, three to five years is a good time horizon, and I think that you'll do well in most of the stocks in that timeframe are.
NEUT2|Our view is that the domestic airlines Spirit Airlines Southwest Airlines are two of our top picks and both have operations in Florida.
NEUT3|Both have big operations in Florida.
NEUT4|Just heard Phil talking about.
NEUT5|People traveling there this this winter.
NEUT6|So yes, I think you will make money in in the stocks over the next three to five years affect your time horizon.
NEUT7|But let me just ask and not just make money, I'm talking about making super money.
BULL8|Meaning do you believe that Southwest is going to get back to close to $60.00?
BULL9|Do you believe that Spirit is going to get back to the pre February levels?
NEUT10|Is American going to get back to those levels 234 years out from now?
BULL11|Well, that that that that's a real return.
NEUT12|If it's true, yes, OK, so yes, can I give you my analyst yes or no answer?
BULL13|Yes, there's lots of upside.
BULL14|OK, you can see these stocks doubling.
NEUT15|Tripling might be hard, because remember they've all had to issue equity to the government, so they've got to.
NEUT16|We're going to dilute the share count based on that.
NEUT17|That equity and then American is in the market with 38 and a half million share offering this week.
NEUT18|We expect the industry to issue equity in the next year as they try to dig themselves out of this hole.
BEAR19|So yes, we can definitely see these stocks doubling off the lows, but tripling might be hard just because of that dilution.
NEUT20|You say off the lows I'm talking about.
NEUT21|If I bought in today, you consider today the lows.
NEUT22|Still, I think we're where you know.
BEAR23|We've seen the stocks give back.
NEUT24|Some of that came that we saw on Monday and Tuesday.
BULL25|There vaccine stocks almost right in the vaccine is is working well in the stocks go up.
NEUT26|The vaccine doesn't work well or it doesn't come.
BEAR27|Or there's talk of another lock down.
BEAR28|Then the stocks are going to go down, so I don't.
NEUT29|I don't mean to be punny, but it's kind of up and down.
NEUT30|I think Andrew you will make money off.
NEUT31|Of these prices, for if you have a three to five year time horizon.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
