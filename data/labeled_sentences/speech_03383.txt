BULL3|That's just one part of the continuing confidence that centrist Emmanuel McComb will clinch the presidency over the far right's mapping.
BULL4|Le Pen French stocks remain well supported after yesterday's.
BEAR5|Big jump and the key German stock Index is a new record, while the classic Bolt holes of gold and the yen continues to weaken, Viva la falls with stocks everywhere looking bright in the US markets tip for further gains.
NEUT6|Eyes are on whether the tech focus NASDAQ will today hit 6000 for the first time.
NEUT7|It doesn't have the same ring as Dow 20,000, but with tech Giants like Apple, Google and Amazon set for earnings releases, it could be the next round Number to attract attention.
