NEUT0|"""Doctor Gary Dayton in your book trade mindfully you discuss the psychology of trading."
NEUT1|Once you talk about the emotions and the psychology right now that the NASDAQ has reclaimed that 5000 Mark, is it regret relief, greed, fear?
NEUT2|What are people feeling out there?
NEUT3|A lot of regret.
NEUT4|You have a lot of folks who because of the down market in 2008 into 2009.
NEUT5|They're standing on the sidelines and they've been standing there for now.
BULL6|456 years of this bull market, and it's been a beautiful bull market.
NEUT7|But there's sitting there saying kind of kicking themselves.
NEUT8|I wish I was in this market.
NEUT9|And what's the best way to get over that regret?
NEUT10|Or should they get over that regret so they keep kicking themselves?
NEUT11|No, they shouldn't kick themselves.
NEUT12|That's never very useful.
NEUT13|What they need to do is to be more mindful about the market, understand what their process is in selecting an making trades, and managing their trades, and exiting exiting their trades.
NEUT14|And focus on that, not so much the emotions that they have.
NEUT15|Is it possible to trade mindfully?
NEUT16|However, when you're in a bubble, sure, it's the best time in fact, to be mindful when when the market is volatile, when it's moving forward, and potentially could could top out.
NEUT17|That's exactly the time you want to be mindful.
NEUT18|Now.
NEUT19|A lot of people fall in love with stocks.
NEUT20|Right now.
NEUT21|It's Apple.
NEUT22|I mean, it's really taken.
NEUT23|The NASDAQ up from the depths of 2000.
NEUT24|So talk about the dangers of falling in love with the stock.
NEUT25|Well, we would call that the endowment effect.
NEUT26|It actually has a term where once we own a stock like Apple, and particularly if we're interested in the iPhone and the iPad, and we know all the features and see those as being very important too.
NEUT27|Stock and holding that stock, it becomes very difficult to let it go.
NEUT28|I had a client who was had in fact owned Apple.
NEUT29|An would not sell it, even though it had climaxed at the top and kind of got parabolic and it was clear from a technical point of view that it was time to let that stock go.
NEUT30|And how did you get him over the hump?
NEUT31|Well being again mindfulness is a big part of this is just it's being it's pulling back and understanding things like this mental trap we have called the endowment effect and.
NEUT32|Just being aware of it so that you can take action and not get trapped with it and then on the flip side we heard Bill Ackman Rail into Herbalife.
BEAR33|It seemed like he was so caught up in consuming this stock and consuming his hate for the stock consumed him that a lot of people thought he lost.
NEUT34|You know good reason for, you know for hating it so much.
NEUT35|How do you avoid that right?
NEUT36|That's just the flip side of this that you love it.
BEAR37|You hate it.
NEUT38|Try to let that those sorts of things go.
NEUT39|Notice those emotions.
NEUT40|Notice that they are.
NEUT41|Are there, but they're going to come, and they're going to go on their own, and they really have little to do with the quality or not.
NEUT42|Quality of a stock.
BULL43|Alright, thanks for coming.
NEUT44|Thank you.
BULL45|"Thank you for watching the street."""
