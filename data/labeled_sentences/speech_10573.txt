BULL0|"""And we've talked for the last week and a half about the fact that a path to the vaccine would face some setbacks."
NEUT1|And clearly New York City schools, new state of emergency in Wisconsin speak to that, right?
NEUT2|I think that one of the things that we needed was a bridge which would be stimulus to the vaccine.
NEUT3|We don't have the stimulus.
BEAR4|We're getting these terrible numbers.
BEAR5|We have half the country that thinks that the numbers are OK given the fact that the death rate has skyrocketed.
NEUT6|We have the other half were saying, look, if we don't do something about it.
BEAR7|Then the health care system is going to be overwhelmed.
NEUT8|In that scenario, it's very difficult to be able to say you know what I am going to start buying stocks, not worrying about the illness because one day will be a vaccine.
NEUT9|David is long as we were close to a vaccine, or at least thinking we were close and there was nothing catastrophic between that.
BEAR10|Then we would be happy to buy all sorts of stocks, but it is catastrophic out.
NEUT11|There isn't, well.
NEUT12|We've been talking about the course of the virus over the last couple of weeks more frequently again because we need to.
BEAR13|Because of the potential impact, it's going to have on the overall economy.
BEAR14|Jim and we know that and the numbers are horrible.
BULL15|There's no other way to put it, and as you say, of course different parts of the country are dealing with it in different ways, but the fact is, hospitalizations, which I think is a good measure in terms of our ability to cope with it, is at an all time high.
NEUT16|Where are we?
NEUT17|79,000?
BEAR18|I think something like that approaching 80,000 people being hospitalized in the country, and a number of places are very close to being potentially overwhelmed.
NEUT19|And that's a key consideration here, because at that point.
NEUT20|Your government does need to do something locally and typically to try to shut things down in some way to prevent a healthcare crisis, but the lock down is not embraced by a series of states.
NEUT21|No mask, not embrace, viewed as being frivolous, or is a Danish study came out last night that said.
NEUT22|But if yous have people out basket have done it doesn't work.
NEUT23|Of course.
NEUT24|The whole point is to have everyone wear masks, so I mean look if you want me to sneeze on you, alright?
NEUT25|Yeah, I think you prefer me to have a mask that's just kind of cut and dried and quarrel.
NEUT26|I look for things like just two days ago where we had some just roaring or yesterday with target, roaring retail numbers and saying OK, those are ones they're going to accept that they will get through a lock down.
NEUT27|They will get through it ever and then you get a little beleaguered and say you know what?
NEUT28|I don't know who's going to go because it's too scary.
NEUT29|So you're back to using shipped.
NEUT30|At Target, you're back to using Amazon.
BULL31|I think that Amazon comes out the winner here when we talk to Good RX, I think that you're going to feel even better.
BULL32|Even if Duggers puts up a good fight.
NEUT33|Amazon is what you go back to.
NEUT34|That's what you defaulted to when this started, and it's what you default to now.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
