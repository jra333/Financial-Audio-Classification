BEAR0|"""Well, I think the thinking here is is the data we're seeing now are old news."
NEUT1|It doesn't incorporate the impact of particularly this latest pivot toward Mexico and the possibility of tariffs there, let alone maybe even the impact of the broader tariffs on China.
NEUT2|So to some extent the markets are discounting anything.
NEUT3|Even if you, these car sales numbers that Steve mentioned, yes, there's strong now, but when these tariffs go on, if prices go up, if the cost be through the consumer, those numbers won't stay there.
NEUT4|And so everyone is looking ahead.
NEUT5|And that's where you see the market.
NEUT6|Anticipating that will get something probably got me well, confused 'cause I've looked at the customs data and I'm pretty sure it's American companies and individuals that are paying for the the the the tariffs rather than Chinese exporters.
NEUT7|Maybe someone that's being person I don't know.
NEUT8|But the fact the matter is when you get tariffs you get some form of inflation coming through the system.
NEUT9|But then you also get concerns about economic growth as well.
NEUT10|So do tariffs lead to higher inflation?
NEUT11|Hence the Fed has to stand Pat or to tariffs lead to economic deterioration.
NEUT12|Hence the Fed has to cut.
BEAR13|Well, it's interesting because when you were mentioning break evens Anne Anne they are falling.
NEUT14|So inflation expectations.
BULL15|The markets are betting that the economic drag, the slower growth that will put downward pressure on prices will more than offset the upward pressure that you might see from from tariffs.
NEUT16|I have to say I'm more worried about the corporate profits business slow down and the angle of this rather than the consumer hit or higher inflation.
NEUT17|I don't see.
NEUT18|I guess I'm more concerned.
BEAR19|That businesses will be forced to absorb the cost of the tariffs.
NEUT20|They won't be able to pass the cost through to consumers, so it won't be an inflation story.
NEUT21|It will be a corporate profits.
NEUT22|I'm more concerned that the markets more concerned about the fact they won't be able to have their buybacks anymore, because every quarter we get this stunning by about stats and they are absolutely ginormous.
NEUT23|I don't think John is a real word, but they are big.
NEUT24|But the fact of the matter is, I think it's about buybacks.
NEUT25|I think it's a huge huge S 'cause there's a word of the moment.
BULL26|Phenomenal apparently phenomenal trade deal.
NEUT27|That's it three times as big as we're doing now, we're talking all together here but but but I'm I'm more concerned about the buybacks.
NEUT28|I don't think that's what the market is saying.
NEUT29|What have we got the ammo to do?
NEUT30|More buybacks, I guess, but I even myself who tends to be an economic optimists, I am quite concerned now, by the unpredictability of recent actions from the president that will cool investment, so they won't be doing buybacks.
NEUT31|But they also may not be.
BULL32|"Investing and more importantly, we may not be hiring as robustly as they were, and that to me, is a more fundamental concern than even just the lack of vibrators."""
