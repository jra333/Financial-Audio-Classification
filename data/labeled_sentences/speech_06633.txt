BEAR0|"""Guys, the wallstreetbets stocks are looking horrible today."
NEUT1|Absolutely terribly.
NEUT2|Hello everyone, my name is Steven from market craze.

NEUT4|If you're returning member.
NEUT5|Welcome back and today I want to talk to you guys about AMC.

BEAR8|Guys, like I said, it is looking awful for AMC in GameStop and all these other companies.
NEUT9|But in this video I'm just going to talk about AMC right now.
NEUT10|So as of recording this video.
BEAR11|OMC is down 32% on the day, down to about $7.00.
BEAR12|An honestly bro, I don't even know how to feel about this because AMC did go a little bit back up yesterday, but it seems like it's just crashing now now.
BULL13|Don't get me wrong, I am still very hopeful.
BULL14|I think AMC could see a nice 10 to $15 back again, but I honestly don't see this hitting $20 anytime soon again.
NEUT15|Guys at the end of the day, we don't really have any say in what Wall Street does.
NEUT16|Wall Street could seriously do whatever they want, and maybe it is illegal, but if they're in power and their billionaires, it doesn't matter what's legal and what's illegal.
NEUT17|While sure banning together in buying up a stock in talking about a stock and saying, hey guys, we're going to screw over these billionaires is a bit unethical, but they've done it for years, and now that we do it, it's a problem that makes no sense.
NEUT18|But again, this is Wall Street.
NEUT19|They don't care about us, they want to see us suffer so that they can win.
NEUT20|And that's just the harsh facts, and that's a hard truth to swallow.
BEAR21|No, not all hope is lost.
NEUT22|We could see a short squeeze still, but in my opinion and I'm not a financial advisor, if you guys see a huge run up I would take at least some profits.
NEUT23|If you guys are still trying to leave some money in there that you're willing willing to lose, go ahead and do that.
NEUT24|But I know some people gambled with money that they don't even have.
BEAR25|Look as much as I want AMC to go crazy and have it insane run up.
NEUT26|It's almost out of the question right now.
NEUT27|If AMC will have that run up or not.
NEUT28|I just feel like it's a bit too far away from possibility right now.
BULL29|I'm still very hopeful and I'm going to be holding.
NEUT30|But I'm just trying to make you guys kind of aware that this could be it for AMC.
NEUT31|Now there's no need to panic sell again.
NEUT32|I'm not a financial advisor, but I would keep holding because AMC before the pandemic pre pandemic was at 15 to $20.00 an had a high high of $40.
NEUT33|We could see that once the pandemic is lifted because people will be going to the movies more often because they haven't been able to for like a whole year.
NEUT34|So AMC will be a very good asset to have in your portfolio in a year or two from now.
NEUT35|It might be a little bit of a wait before you get the massive run up, but I think AMC could probably see $40 whenever the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
NEUT36|Icmc hitting around $10 tomorrow, but not going much further than that.
NEUT37|I see a lot of people selling off after this.
NEUT38|An yeah, it's going to be really sad, but again, I'm not a financial advisor, but I'm going to hold until the pandemic restrictions are lifted.
