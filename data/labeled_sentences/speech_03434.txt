NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another stock technical analysis video today."
NEUT1|We're looking at Apple ticker symbol AAPL.
BEAR2|Apple had a slow month ending February off down nearly 10%, and currently we're sitting at some pretty major price levels that can give insight as to where more money might start flowing back into the stock.
NEUT3|Starting on the daily chart, you can see three major price levels to look at, one at $125, another at $120.00 and our last one sitting at $110.
BEAR4|Jumping to the four hour chart, you can see that at this $120.00 level price is starting to slow down and consolidate, which shows that there is more demand at this price.
NEUT5|But where can price go from here?
BULL6|Looking back at the daily chart, we have this larger trend line that has been holding up for the past six months and lines up very nicely with the $120.00 level.
BEAR7|However, it is very clear that we aren't seeing nearly as much strength on this retest compared to the previous bounds overall.
BULL8|Given the weakness of this pull back, I want to see Apple break and retest the $125 level to see more strength.
NEUT9|If Apple failed to hold this $120.00 level, I believe that $110 is the next area of interest.
BEAR10|From there, our targets would be this resistance all the way up here, and an overall break of all time highs.
