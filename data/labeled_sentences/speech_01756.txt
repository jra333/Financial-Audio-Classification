BEAR5|I took a look at three stocks to avoid last week predicting that blink charging NASDAQ BLNK, Cedar Fair, NYSE fun and sundial growers, NASDAQ SMDL blink charging declined nearly 11% on the week.
BULL6|Cedar Fair came through with a well received quarterly report.
BULL7|Shares of the regional amusement park operator moved 8% higher last week.
BEAR8|Sundial growers was the biggest loser of the three stocks to avoid the speculative cannabis specialist side stock plummet 26% for the week.
BEAR9|The three stocks averaged a 9.7% decline for the week.
BULL10|The S&P 500 zero point 7% dip was considerably better than blended.
NEUT11|Return of the three stocks.
NEUT12|I got it right this week.
BEAR13|This week I see Churchill Capital IVNYSEC Civ Osprey, Bitcoin trust, OTC oh, BTC and altrix NYSE Ayx as vulnerable investments in the near term.
NEUT14|Here's why I think these are three stocks to avoid this week.

NEUT16|Churchill Capital I.
NEUT17|There's been a lot of love for special purpose acquisition companies or Spag sees these days.
NEUT18|These blank check companies are moving higher, sometimes just on the speculative width of a potential acquisition.
BULL19|Churchill Capital Ivy has been putting the pedal to the metal in recent weeks on rumors that it's close to announcing a combination with Lucid Motors, an upstart electric vehicle maker that's hoping to make its mark at the high end of the booming market.
NEUT20|There's a lot to like when it comes to lucid Motors.
NEUT21|It's the brainchild of a former Tesla engineer and its first lucid Air model is already taking presale reservations.
NEUT22|The problem here is mathematical Churchill.
NEUT23|Capital Ivy has a little less than $10 a share in cash.
NEUT24|The stock is trading more than five times higher than that.
NEUT25|If Churchill Capital Ivy has to line up more financing, it will probably come from private investment in public equity pipe firms that will want in closer to $10 a share for a 10 figure investment deal, makers are currently valuing lucid Motors between $12 billion and $20 billion.
NEUT26|Why would it take less than $0.20 on the dollar?
NEUT27|Why would it want to leave money on the table that was made by speculators who have been bidding the stock higher?
NEUT28|Why doesn't lucid Motors just go public on its own?
NEUT29|"You can argue that Churchill Capital Ivy isn't going to buy all of lucid Motors with its modest nest egg, but good luck telling investors that."""
