NEUT0|"""Let's talk about a deal you did recently."
NEUT1|Occidental right where you agreed to back them up.
NEUT2|You cut that deal, and then you called Charlie.
NEUT3|But you know what he was thinking already.
NEUT4|I didn't want to wake him up.
NEUT5|Pacific Coast I might not be very unverified problem or a new I'd be for that this year.
NEUT6|How, how did?
NEUT7|How did you know that?
NEUT8|How?
NEUT9|How do you know so much about each other and how you think?
NEUT10|Well, accidentals in my part of the world, and of course I've.
NEUT11|Followed to some extent the developments that are interesting and what do you think of the accidental deal?
NEUT12|Why do you like why I think it's got potential?
NEUT13|Because.
NEUT14|Well, because.
NEUT15|I think that Occidental is right to want to do it.
NEUT16|To buy into the Permian Basin to get more assets, absolutely.
NEUT17|And what is it about the Permian Basin that you like?
NEUT18|It's got a lot of oil.
NEUT19|I'm glad you don't like desert just for his own self say I. I asked Warren this earlier today if it's such a great deal in the Permian Basin, is such a great deal, why didn't you just buy Anadarko?
NEUT20|Nobody asked us to.
NEUT21|Well, an answer that may sound strange but but.
NEUT22|Who knows if they come to us, you know?
NEUT23|We knew.
NEUT24|We do usually wait till people come to us so it isn't like we if we wanted to buy into the field we necessarily start dialing and flying around and everything that that accidental knows a lot about the base and we don't.
NEUT25|Actually like having somebody with us that knows something about it.
NEUT26|Yeah, when we were in Solomon we had something called Anglo American something promotional operation but was not angle Persian.
NEUT27|Something at it anyway, but it was.
NEUT28|It was, yeah yeah English, British or something.
NEUT29|Whatever it was, it was neither.
NEUT30|It was neither angle Swiss actually angle Swiss and they came to the directors and had this big plan for drilling in Russian and we were going to put a lot of money and send it to Siberia and hope that we got oil back and Charlie said, you know who's Anglo and and.
NEUT31|Who Swiss?
NEUT32|It was Swiss and and of course none of these people were, I mean, so they were lying and the name of the company that did not go over so well with the Solomon Board.
NEUT33|With Charlie pointed out that we sent a lot of money to Siberia and they brought one.
NEUT34|Never got it back either.
NEUT35|We got one little vial of oil.
NEUT36|The guy came to see me one time after become chairman.
NEUT37|He showed me this magnificent.
NEUT38|You know, exactly the kind of oil they wanted.
NEUT39|That's the only oil waivers.
NEUT40|So and it was producing 50,000 barrels a day tored the end, they just kept it all.
NEUT41|The Anglo Swiss angle Swiss.
NEUT42|No anglers are no Swiss, just lies all the way down.
NEUT43|Let me ask you though about Occidental in this deal in particular.
NEUT44|If you like the Permian Basin, but you've also both commented on times when you think you've paid too much in the past.
BEAR45|Is there a number that would hit that you would think, OK, this is paying too much for the Permian Basin to Charlie.
NEUT46|Of course all the time we always think that way, yeah?
NEUT47|But it's not anywhere near it.
NEUT48|The price that they're paying right now, you know, we don't know.
NEUT49|We don't know if they may be the last dollar.
BULL50|"All we know is we're willing to do it."""
