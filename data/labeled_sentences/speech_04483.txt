NEUT0|"""Alright, a little less than two minutes before we get started with trading, let's squeeze in a mad dash."
NEUT1|Jim, it's Apple.
NEUT2|Yes, we've got 2 notes today.
BULL3|We have cow and talking about the services stream doing much better and really just basically saying this thing is growing to the point that it is a needle mover.
NEUT4|And then we have a piece.
NEUT5|Some people gardening is curious by Katy Huberty biggest bowl on Morgan Stanley raising services forecasts on stronger licensing revenue.
NEUT6|That's the headline.
NEUT7|But there is a price target.
BEAR8|Cut from 164 down to 156.
NEUT9|Now if you read through this, the cut is about the compression of price to earnings multiples in the peers and there would be thinking about Microsoft.
NEUT10|You might be thinking about Google Now I do question how much to emphasize the price target cut versus the raising service forecast.
NEUT11|This service forecast is the part of the machine that is.
NEUT12|Apple gets the higher multiple so I wouldn't be surprised if Apple has an upside surprise.
NEUT13|And I think that that surprise, surprise, and that does matter, and so I would read less into the price target cut and more into the service revenue forecast going up and not care about the price.
NEUT14|Compression David let that take care of itself.
BEAR15|OK, all right kind of been flat, we can see it for for quite awhile now.
BEAR16|Anna down about 5% this year you would already here then is what I'm hearing you say is the bargain in the group look.
NEUT17|One of the things that's really incredible just is that Fang other than Alphabet, really had lag.
NEUT18|So I think people really jumped on it 'cause there cheaper than the highest growth stocks that you know and said over and over again are selling at price to sales.
NEUT19|Not sustainable for the average institution.
NEUT20|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT21|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
