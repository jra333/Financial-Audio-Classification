BEAR0|"""A Bitcoin is trading back above $11,000 today, but it's being shown up by a little known cryptocurrency that was started as a joke."
NEUT1|The coin named after a popular dog meme, so called Doge coin, is popping.
BULL2|You can see there up about 10% today after being added to popular crypto exchange Binance.
NEUT3|In the announcement Binance CEO CZ gave a tip of the hat to Tesla CEO Elon Musk for being part of the decision to add Doge coin to the trading platform.
BULL4|Noting that Musk has been quite.
NEUT5|The fan calling it his quote, favorite cryptocurrency and sharing of various doge coin related memes on Twitter.
BULL6|Bitcoin still though holds the larger year to date gains so far this year up nearly 200% compared to Dogecoins.
BULL7|Roughly 60% gains, including what we're seeing today.
NEUT8|Kristen, you shrug because you're not a big crypto fan or meme fan.
NEUT9|I can only guess I'm a huge no.
NEUT10|I'm a huge meme fan.
NEUT11|Look this.
NEUT12|This just says this is my entire problem with crypto currency, right?
BULL13|A crypto currency was created as a joke and it's up 60% sure Bitcoin up 200.
NEUT14|I just I don't know.
NEUT15|I don't know how anyone can be a really serious investor.
NEUT16|Being being a really serious investor in how this is, Bitcoin are two very different things.
NEUT17|Although yes it was created as a joke, but it's market cap still nearly half a billion dollars when we look at Doge coin, when it's you know, it is evidence of the entire cryptocurrency market that things can move on a tweet.
NEUT18|So I think that in the same line is Kristen.
NEUT19|I'm not so positive about goes man that ever higher Lee the problem and that is entirely the problem.
BEAR20|It's a leverage problem.
NEUT21|Something very quickly can either make that make it.
NEUT22|Skyrocket or completely tank it, that is, that's not something that I would ever want to invest in.
NEUT23|Well.
NEUT24|The one thing is, Coinbase also has doge coin supported by its wallet, so that was one thing.
NEUT25|They added that back in May and now by ***** adding doge coin as well, even the founder of Dutch coin though has said he doesn't hold it.
NEUT26|He doesn't hold doge coin, so that's important to note is an issue that's problematic.
NEUT27|I mean, imagine if you were of any other company and your CEO is like I don't know if Jeff Bezos is like I don't use Amazon.
NEUT28|Yeah, yeah it was.
NEUT29|I'm all about Bitcoin ether, you know, forget Doge coin.
NEUT30|Yeah, it is.
NEUT31|I understand it.
NEUT32|I'm sure there will be some tweets saying why you talking bout Dutchman.
NEUT33|"I don't disagree but we have to notice today since it got added by *****."""
