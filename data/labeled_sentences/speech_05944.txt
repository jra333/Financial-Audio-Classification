BULL0|"""Welcome to locate gems tonight."
NEUT1|I'm gonna be talking about a few coins that aren't a big low captains, but once it is solid, pretty safe, and then we'll definitely 5X in this bull run.
NEUT2|The first one I'm going to talk about is Filecoin.
NEUT3|This one is about $156 right now has about a $10 billion market cap.
NEUT4|Was about four point $4.4 billion in March in a volume, so that gives it amount of 44% volume market cap.
BEAR5|So lower than we'd like to see.
NEUT6|But for a big, safer coin.
NEUT7|Pretty pretty normal, actually.
NEUT8|It's not about 65,847 watchlist, so definitely a coin that people like and people are paying attention to.
NEUT9|Ultimately, if you look at the website, it's just really clean, and if you actually come to the website in Europe for his display button, it gives you a full explanation and walkthrough of exactly how the project works and when it does basically what they are is a digital blockchain based cloud storage system for the entire global ecosystem.
NEUT10|That is the cheapest way to use their saying and basically they make it so you can get to all your data as fast as possible with having local networks.
NEUT11|So sounds interesting.
NEUT12|Definitely see some competitors here like Storage a an A few other ones, but I like that different companies are working on this and working to solve that problem.
BEAR13|Ultimately, it has run a lot lately just from say.
NEUT14|February 5th was at about $24.00, so right now it's about a 6X since then.
NEUT15|So definitely is run a lot, so I don't expect this to get like a 10 or 100 X.
NEUT16|But definitely this get a five yeah three to five X from here and get to around 30 to $50 billion by the top of the market by the top of the bull cycle.
NEUT17|So ultimately one to watch out for if there's any other projects you want us to discuss like this, go ahead and hit us up in the comments an other than that.
NEUT18|Everything here is just our opinions, not financial advice.
NEUT19|"Any investor going to contact a certified financial advisor?"""
