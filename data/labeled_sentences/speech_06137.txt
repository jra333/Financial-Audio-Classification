NEUT0|"""Steve Forbes joins the program."
NEUT1|Now the forms media chairman and where are you on this Steve?
BULL2|The idea that, well, we still have job growth but it's slowing.
NEUT3|We have a ways to go till we get to the vaccines full rollout.
BULL4|So that means we need more stimulus.
NEUT5|That makes sense.
NEUT6|Only partially, because you see a real dichotomy.
NEUT7|Real division between blue States and red States and how they're reacting to the spike in the coronavirus.
BEAR8|And that's why you saw the slowdown in the job growth.
BEAR9|Not only did you have 100,000 census workers are no longer employed by the government, but you had a real slowdown in restaurants and bars and seasonal holiday workers who would normally be several.
BEAR10|100,000 people are now staying away from the stores, but then you see the real.
BEAR11|Sharp division between a red state like Florida Blue State like New York in terms of unemployment.
NEUT12|So in terms of a stimulus bill doing something for small businesses absolutely necessary, I'd go along with another check of 1500.
NEUT13|Two $1000 for individuals.
NEUT14|Lower income individuals like we did in the spring, but after that you don't have to do that much more.
NEUT15|The key things keep those small businesses going.
BULL16|Give another relief package to individuals and this economy.
BULL17|If states will allow it will get back on track really very vigorously.
NEUT18|So the key thing is for state notice Larry their act together not behave like Los Angeles is doing now.
NEUT19|I notice Larry Kudlow and Blakes police did not bring up the $1200 checks or even more for individuals, instead talking about the Paycheck Protection program money for small business actually talked about extending unemployment insurance, which is not something that all Conservatives or Republicans are necessarily on board with the enhanced unemployment insurance from the federal government.
NEUT20|What's your view on that?
NEUT21|You'd rather see the money go directly to individuals.
NEUT22|Is that what you're saying?
NEUT23|If you had to choose?
NEUT24|Absolutely, because that's broader.
NEUT25|Based gives substantial relief, doesn't distort the labor markets in any way or different costs of living in various parts of the country.
NEUT26|So go across the board and if you make it to generous that allow people to start paying their bills that are made of accumulated, get them to spend more during the holiday season.
NEUT27|Then it's a one shot an it's done.
NEUT28|So go that way.
NEUT29|And I think that would be the best tonic for the economy rather than trying to fool around with the labor markets.
NEUT30|Well, the economy might need some tonic, and there's certainly a case for it.
NEUT31|The stock market, on the other hand, has really been something else.
NEUT32|Any surprise from you or any comment in general, on the Dow 30,200 up, another 250 points today, even with this will talk about in detail in a moment, all the virus numbers.
BEAR33|Even with the slowdown in jobs, or maybe because of it.
NEUT34|Because it's counting on more stimulus, but it's really something else.
NEUT35|What do you make of the stock market?
BEAR36|While the stock market is anticipating that the new administration won't be as destructive as feared, before November that Republicans will retain control of the Senate if the Republicans lose both of those Georgia seats, you're going to see the market really tank.
NEUT37|So the markets anticipate mean good result in Georgia and that the Republicans will be vigilant about some of the regulatory things that Democrats may want to do that would slow the economy.
NEUT38|But the key thing is Blake.
NEUT39|In terms of dealing with the stock market, you can't be at timer.
NEUT40|Or your retirement funds, like 401K's or IR A's.
NEUT41|And things like that keep putting in the money in good times and bad and only do the timing with the rest of your portfolio.
NEUT42|But don't muck around with retirement funds if you just leave them alone, go and few index funds, you'll beat the markets over time, every single time.
NEUT43|Over the long haul, they always go up, don't they?
NEUT44|Those major averages if you, if you're not just, but that's America lustrum, you can get a Medal of America.
NEUT45|They do go up absolutely.
NEUT46|Always go up Steve.
BULL47|Good to see you have a great weekend.
NEUT48|The great Steve Forbes with thank you.
BULL49|"Thanks as always for joining us."""
