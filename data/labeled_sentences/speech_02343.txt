NEUT6|Of Walt Disney and what they do, but they also have segmented into so many different other fields, including streaming their Disney Channel, ESPN, Freeform, different networks.
BULL7|They're really doing quite well and they're bringing 100 and 75,000 jobs, so I like what I see here on what Disney has been doing.
NEUT8|I expect the.
BEAR9|Pandemic does make it harder for them, and when we do get a chance to open back up, that's only going to make things better.
NEUT10|But what they're doing by capitalizing on what's available during this pandemic, I like what I'm seeing here.
BULL11|OK earnings growth.

NEUT24|Disney not applicable due to the most recent.

NEUT32|Let's say I am last but not least, let's take a look at the chart on Disney over the last five years.
BULL33|Has done reasonable, reasonable, reasonable and then spiked up here.
BULL34|And I think this was mostly with the release of and the improvement on their streaming platform.

BULL45|5 out of 10.
