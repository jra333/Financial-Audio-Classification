BULL0|"""Up 90% of the last three days just absolutely surging today."
NEUT1|No, absolutely, and there's a business reason you might say for why this rally got started.
NEUT2|You know why I came out with fourth quarter results.
BULL3|You know earnings beating analysts average estimate of Bloomberg survey by 30% revenue coming out ahead by 20%, and on top of that, Rocket declared a special dividend of $1.11 to share.
NEUT4|So that kind of touch things off you.
BULL5|On Friday the stock was up about 10% on Monday, up 11% and then today.
NEUT6|I mean, it's just kind of gone.
NEUT7|Stratospheric, you might say.
NEUT8|And there are a couple of things going on.
NEUT9|Any one is certainly the continuation of what we saw the past two days and the other they won't be.
NEUT10|People realizing that this is a company that investors have been betting against.
BULL11|You know, short interest has been on the rise this year, along with interest rates.
NEUT12|You figure a mortgage lender.
NEUT13|You would have difficulty because of maintaining growth at a time.
NEUT14|You know when interest rates are going up and therefore home loans are getting more expensive, so you know in the middle of February 38% of rocket shares.
NEUT15|Available for trading had been borrowed and sold or sold short and we got numbers from Esprit Partners which provides more up-to-date information that puts the figure at 46%.
NEUT16|So what happens?
NEUT17|You know the Reddit traders get on the numbers like this and they start pushing the shares higher to squeeze the shorts.
NEUT18|So I mean, there's certainly an overnight.
NEUT19|Why were they shorting though Dave?
BULL20|I mean, I mean, my general understanding is the company was doing relatively well.
BEAR21|We know the mortgage industry as a whole has been on fire.
NEUT22|Is there something more here as to why people would be negative on the stock?
NEUT23|Well, it might well be Romain, just kind of figuring that the company would struggle to maintain the kind of growth in his head, but you know, as far as what they had to send the other day with their quarterly results, it doesn't seem like that's the case.
BULL24|You know they're talking about, you know the dollar value of loans this quarter, possibly doubling from a year ago, and that's close.
BULL25|They close on, you know, as far as investors locking in rates, you know you're talking about an increase that may be as high as 70%, and they expect to gain more when they sell the loans to investors, so.
BEAR26|"You know it's just not playing out so far, at least the way the short sellers might have anticipated and now you have people trying to take advantage of the fact that so many shares have been sold short in anticipation of the client, you're getting the opposite now."""
