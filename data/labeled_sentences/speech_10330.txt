NEUT2|How does the forecast work when it changes direction?
NEUT3|That's when the market is likely to change direction to the forecast doesn't tell you anything about the magnitude of the move, just tells you when an uptrend could turn into a downturn or vice versa based on a cycle forecast.
NEUT4|William sees the S&P 500.
NEUT5|Peaking around July 27.
BULL6|So we've got two more weeks of strength.
BULL7|That's a lifetime in this market, which suggests that the sore thumb thesis articulated the top of the show could be very right that the SNP might be better than the NASDAQ, but the Dow could be even stronger.
BULL8|And meantime, though he wouldn't be surprised if the SP managed to rally back to its old highs, that could be a pretty fabulous rally.
BEAR9|But if Williams is right, it's got a short shelf life.
NEUT10|What makes you so confident that we could see some serious upside for the rally runs out of steam?

BEAR18|The indicator made a new high and then the S&P 500 made a new high later six weeks later to be precise, so Vance declined.
NEUT19|Blue was good and then it moved the next one right now let's zoom in this indicator.
NEUT20|For the past few months.
BULL21|Again, you can see how the S Q-tip the SMB lags the advance decline line, which went to a new high in early June.
NEUT22|If history is, any guide wins.
