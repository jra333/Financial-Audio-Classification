BULL0|"""Good day everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to the Fifth Beast production.
NEUT2|Today we will be talking about Under Armour stock ticker symbol UA.
NEUT3|Please remember that I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own due diligence.
NEUT4|This video takes a lot of time to create, animate and to write the script.
BULL5|Thus a like and subscribe would be truly appreciated.
NEUT6|Firstly we need to remember that the world is still undergoing a pandemic while Under Armour is selling mainly activewear clothing which can have a huge upside to the current situation since we are in a pandemic.
NEUT7|Many people including myself are looking for new hobbies.
NEUT8|And the majority of them are health and sport related.
NEUT9|Let's take a look at the Under Armour stock chart.
BEAR10|As you can see from the five year chart, the stock was in a very bearish run with over 78% loss in the past five years.
BEAR11|Therefore Under Armour was already struggling before the pandemic and especially with big sharks as competition like Adidas and Nike makes it especially difficult for the stock to make a comeback and rally back up to its all time high of $52.
NEUT12|The stock does not pay a dividend, but in some cases.
NEUT13|This might not be as bad, because this means that the company is reinvesting the profit that it makes, rather than sharing a portion of the profits.
BULL14|This in some cases can help reduce the risk of bankruptcy.
BEAR15|Under Armour has a fairly low market capital of 4.73 billion.
BULL16|Well when compared to its closest competitors wear, Nike has a market cap of a whopping 130.99 billion.
NEUT17|But what about the market share?
NEUT18|Firstly, a market share is how many consumers favor your product rather that of your competitors.
BEAR19|Underwear has shrunk from six 4% to 5.6% in the previous years.
BULL20|Yet somehow I still believe that this stock will have a bullish moment after this pandemic is over in the vaccine is found.
NEUT21|This is mainly due that people are getting into a healthier lifestyle who does Under Armour sponsor?
NEUT22|This is one of the most daunting questions as one influencer can get so many new consumers to buy products from Under Armour.
NEUT23|Some of the major celebrities Under Armour sponsors are Dwayne the Rock Johnson famous actor Steve and her NBA player Anthony Joshua and Elite Boxer and so many more.
NEUT24|Literally, the list is endless.
NEUT25|Their sponsorship is spread out almost worldwide.
NEUT26|I will leave a link in my description for you to see all the sponsorships that Under Armour has with athletes, clubs, etc.
NEUT27|All in all, Under Armour's past was one of struggle and this can make investors scared including myself, but the past cannot determine the future in my opinion.
NEUT28|Under Armour can have a steady bullish run, but that's just my opinion so please do your own due diligence and research as I am by no means a financial advisor, but I will be investing in keeping an eye out for this stock.
BULL29|Thanks for watching and I would appreciate a subscribe as it truly helps the channel, especially with all the editing and animation.
