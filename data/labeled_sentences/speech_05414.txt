NEUT0|"""It's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol oh CGN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, I mean the the obvious, but I will anyway is just to establish some context here, but very impressive bounce on this one today.
NEUT5|When you think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here, then all of a sudden it's closed all the way up there.
NEUT6|Any rational person would say that was definitely a very impressive move, but that doesn't have the valid question of.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of genuine strength, or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat bounce that move?
NEUT10|And I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area and that area is down here at $6.35.
NEUT12|Why 635 important?
NEUT13|And I'm not saying this was going to occur, but if the price were to come down to that level and then break down below it, what would that do to the price that would be putting the price essentially right back to where the price already was?
NEUT14|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sign into power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT15|But to be fair, no price just go straight up either.
NEUT16|So maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner.
NEUT17|Then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT18|Now all of a sudden, what would you have while you have a set of those right there, you have those lows down there, and if you envision each one of those, is there steps?
NEUT19|Well, there you go.
NEUT20|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upwards direction, and that's the name of the game.
BULL21|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT22|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined right there around 6:35 in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT23|It is all about that purple line right there.
NEUT24|The 50.
NEUT25|Moving average you can see right there.
BEAR26|Price struggled right around there several times today.
NEUT27|So keep a close eye on that and the current value of that 50.
NEUT28|Moving average will just call right up there around that $7.00 mark.
NEUT29|So watch that very closely, but Oh no.
NEUT30|Anyway, look at it.
BULL31|Very impressive bounce today.
NEUT32|Not just a question of can the price build upon this balance moving forward.
NEUT33|Let's see what happens.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT36|But it will be me.
NEUT37|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT44|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
