BEAR20|Some of these and other indicators haven't been updated yet until the end of the day, but the number of stocks above the 200 day moving average is actually in pretty good shape, so we're not seeing a bear market, and that's something serious starts to Mount to the downside, high low index is relatively weak.
BULL21|And the number of stocks above the 50 day moving average has been moving higher.
BULL22|Yeah, excuse me that's advanced decline line has been moving higher, so that's positive and then number stocks by the 50 day moving average.
