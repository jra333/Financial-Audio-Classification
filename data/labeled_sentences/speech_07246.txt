BULL0|"""Welcome back to Squawk Box."
NEUT1|CNBC has learned the Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's speech at 11:00 o'clock this morning will call for a global minimum corporate tax.
NEUT2|She will say the US is going to work with G20 nations to establish this global minimum.
NEUT3|Corporate taxes says it's necessary to ensure countries have stable finances and have money to invest in vital infrastructure and to address crises.
NEUT4|This was first first reported by Axios when we were able to confirm this Andrew.
NEUT5|As you know, this administration is not a big fan of tax competition either between states or between countries and are.
NEUT6|So Steve, just real quick.
NEUT7|Help us understand this.
BULL8|Do you think that she will succeed in getting all G20 to agree to agree affectively to a minimum tax across the board?
NEUT9|It would end the idea of inversions and all of the issues that we've talked about all over these years, but it would also end competition, and I assume that there's going to be countries that are going to say I want that competition because I want to be able to bring companies to my country based on my tax rate.
NEUT10|I think it may depend.
NEUT11|I think it be difficult at any number, but if the number is sufficiently low and there's some incentive for countries to agree to it, yeah, you could have a global minimum tax at 3% or 4% or 5%.
BULL12|The question is whether or not the US can create a global minimum tax at a place that is advantageous to the US, and that's going to be up near 20%.
BULL13|A place adaptation advantageous to the US as we look to raise the corporate tax rate here to fund things like.
NEUT14|Infrastructure spending keeping in mind the fact that the tax reforms and the lower corporate tax that was imposed back in 2017 actually LED quite a number of other countries developed countries to lower their tax rates as well, which essentially Steve I would imagine maybe a very big ask when that would mean a higher tax rate for those countries and all the politics that that involves there as well.
NEUT15|Yeah, it's it's a fluid situation.
NEUT16|Here's the problem, Morgan.
NEUT17|If you think about like I don't know what's the what's your favorite hotel right?
NEUT18|Is it?
NEUT19|I don't know.
NEUT20|Is it the W with whatever it is W can never bring down its rate low enough.
NEUT21|If you're the W to be under Motel 6.
NEUT22|Yeah right Motel 6 will always if you go to 100 bucks a room with a W. You know Motel 6.
NEUT23|And by the way nothing wrong with Motel 6.
NEUT24|Clean sheets, nice rooms, whatever they're going to be at 50 an if W goes to 50 then Motel 6 gotta go to 25 so that's always going to be an issue.
NEUT25|Globally you're going to have to rotate around the market leader, so I I think you know and you ask that question, can it happen?
NEUT26|I don't know.
NEUT27|It's going to be very difficult because a lot of countries have plenty of incentive to try to put up a vacancy sign for companies around the world.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
