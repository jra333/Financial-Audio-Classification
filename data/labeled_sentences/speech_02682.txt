BEAR1|the US bond market is conflicted from the buyers perspective.
NEUT2|There's no inflationary pressure.

NEUT10|But are the buyers forgetting about supply and demand?
BEAR11|the US budget deficit is a trillion dollars a year in climbing.
NEUT12|U.S. Treasury is been issuing a lot of short term Treasury bills, but it will also issue more long term maturity notes and bonds to central banks are not buying as many US Treasurys as they once did, including China.
NEUT13|The US Federal Reserve is letting its Treasury security portfolio shrink through runoffs, not sales, but it's not replacing either.
NEUT14|So the feds, not a buyer.
NEUT15|Any good news or positive surprises on the trade war?
BULL16|Well, that has the ability to lift equities and possibly hit bonds.
NEUT17|It's a tug of war.
