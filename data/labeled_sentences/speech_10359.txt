NEUT0|"""Yeah I I shut it when I hear you say lock down again 'cause it seems hard to imagine in some ways given the vaccine is getting put into people's arms right now, right?"
NEUT1|Well, look maybe.
NEUT2|I mean, has anyone said it's almost?
BEAR3|Yeah you have to be careful about negligence, but does anyone said that perhaps this strain in the UK David is not as transmittable and there's just something wrong with the UK?
NEUT4|Or that perhaps what is we gotta try to figure it out?
NEUT5|I mean what can I give it to you from a further distance?
NEUT6|Does it go 12 feet instead of 60?
NEUT7|Now we have no idea.
NEUT8|I don't know anything I don't know.
NEUT9|I don't know that we know anything and not sure what's been written.
NEUT10|Carla cell until we find out.
NEUT11|Yeah well, I guess that's what's happening today.
BEAR12|Seems wrong to me.
NEUT13|Well, the European Medicines Agency, by the way, Jim, which just gave conditional OK to the Pfizer Biontech vaccine, says there's no nothing no evidence to suggest that the vaccine won't work against the new variant, but to your point, very little of this.
NEUT14|Higher transmissibility has been put on paper, so we're going to wait to see if we get that at the NYSE today.
NEUT15|Southwestern Energy, doing the honors at the NASDAQ.
NEUT16|It's open door technology, a digital platform for residential.
NEUT17|Real estate in.
NEUT18|With that Jim, we did get a final bounce in the future is right before the Bell.
NEUT19|Look I I have to tell you that when I saw them go down big, I was trying to figure out how you could drive the $900 billion package in the service sector.
BULL20|Talked about incredible numbers for the banks and the buybacks that extends to regionals and Nationals.
BULL21|And then Nike is such a great quarter saying so much good.
NEUT22|And then I gotta tell you that correlate mean I remember that there were so many stocks that did well in a period where.
NEUT23|Things were terrible and when I come back to us, perhaps something could be related to Tesla.
NEUT24|Tesla is now big part of the SNP test.
BEAR25|It goes down a lot.
NEUT26|The SNP can actually be moved by that, so let's not forget.
NEUT27|It tests the turns around.
BULL28|I think again, that the SNP could get a little umph.
NEUT29|I am not willing to give up on this market because of a 70% number in the UK where the UK has been particularly, let's just say absent in terms of the way it's handled this so we can all take every single Q we want from the UK, Carl.
BULL30|Or we can take our cue from some of the companies that are going to be doing quite well here.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
