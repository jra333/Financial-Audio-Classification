NEUT0|"""I've had a lifelong love affair with eggs, but not all eggs are the same."
NEUT1|And so when you take a chicken and you stick it in a cage for their entire life and you take that egg out, you feed it one ingredient for its entire life.
NEUT2|Big sort of bland.
NEUT3|Don't taste that great, but when you put a bird on pasture in the eating grass as part of their diet, you get this vibrant color yolk and a delicious tasting egg.
NEUT4|So I wondered if it was possible to scale that type of.
NEUT5|Egg production that you get on a small farm with the birds.
NEUT6|Live outdoors into a national program where you grew up on farms throughout the warmer parts of the country.
NEUT7|People really care about where their food comes from today.
NEUT8|They care about the nutrition of their food, animal welfare.
NEUT9|They care about the family farmer like never before.
NEUT10|That's what vital farms been about since day one.
BULL11|We treat the soil and the farms in the pastures sustainably.
NEUT12|We don't use chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
NEUT13|So today we have well over 100 farms located throughout what we call the pasture belt, which is the southern part of the Midwest in nine states where it's chickens are able to go out year round on pasture.
NEUT14|Pasture raising has been defined as being based on the European standard of 1000 birds per hectare, which is 108 square feet per bird, outdoors of pasture.
NEUT15|And then of course have a safe warm environment indoors for them to stay at night and today pasture raised as a major category.
NEUT16|Grocery stores 9000 stores in the United States carry pasteurized egg on the shelf.
BULL17|I see that growing continually.
NEUT18|These birds were very social creatures and so they like to go outside.
NEUT19|They like to dust, bathe.
NEUT20|They like to eat.
NEUT21|They like to roam around.
NEUT22|I'd like to chase each other like to come back inside.
NEUT23|They also like to be around humans.
NEUT24|Sometimes you just get lucky and I think that's a big part of any success.
NEUT25|If you work really hard, sometimes you get that merger.
NEUT26|That's what happened.
NEUT27|The case of little farms, we hit it at the right time.
BULL28|"We kept to our standards, but at the same time the marketplace came to us and really worked."""
