NEUT0|"""He is playing this via video chart on ticker symbol K ND."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful move on this one today.
BEAR5|Unfortunately, in the bearish direction, an overall yeah, it was a rough day, just 'cause the price went down, but it was also rough because the price broke down through a bunch of key levels of support.
NEUT6|So there is that level of support that was violated and then there is this set of loans right here.
BEAR7|Another level of support that was violated.
BEAR8|So yeah, it was red, but in the function in which it was red breaking through all those levels of support, just a rough overall day.
NEUT9|And that's where things you need to start off, at least in my opinion is OK. Well, all those levels of support were broken, so where some of these next potential areas of support at moving forward.
NEUT10|And the next big one to watch very closely.
BEAR11|Is going to be down here at $9.15 now.
BEAR12|I'm not saying the prices head down at 9:15.
NEUT13|I'm just saying that is the next area that really stands out.
NEUT14|I mean, you go back through the history of the chart and you can see this is a little consolidation area.
BEAR15|Their price then bounced.
NEUT16|Head of a fake pull back right there.
NEUT17|You know, the Bears got excited, but once again you can see it bounced right at that green line before going up again.
NEUT18|So if the price does go down at 9:15 mark, you know it's a question of OK. Is history is going to repeat itself?
NEUT19|Is the price is going to be able to hold strong like it's done those previous instances?
NEUT20|Or you know, are there bears going to be strong enough that you know, push down through that area?
NEUT21|So that is where 915 is coming from and why it is such an important area from the support side of things.
NEUT22|But as of now the price isn't necessarily close to being there, but nonetheless that is still going to be the key overall level of support to watch closely in the event there is any sort of bounces back to the upside first, the level of resistance to watch on any sort of attempted bounce going to be right up there at $11.75.
NEUT23|Then you also want to watch that Purple line there.
NEUT24|The 50.
NEUT25|Moving average and the current value of that is right there on will just call it $13.50.
BULL26|But overall, yeah, definitely rough way to start the week, but we'll see if the price can try to get things turned around or not moving forward.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
