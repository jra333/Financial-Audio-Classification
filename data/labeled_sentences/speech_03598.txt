NEUT0|"""MMT's were burning right here at 99% at 100%, but here's the most important thing right now."
BULL1|I'm about to break that inner Dave trend ratio high 3737 neck to neck at 5.917.
NEUT2|He's Nope, we did not break it.
NEUT3|There it is right here.
NEUT4|Let's make sure you can see it.
NEUT5|It's right here 3736 I'm approaching that break out.
NEUT6|Can I break that teeny high?
NEUT7|Am I going to break that teeny?
BULL8|Hi, I'm 6 pennies from breaking that dollar movement teeny high right here and I better keep throwing boning out 100.
NEUT9|Otherwise I can't.
NEUT10|OK, the time is 11:47 AM Pacific Standard Time 46 2011.
NEUT11|That's the timestamp.
NEUT12|If you don't believe the timestamp, let me click on the three minute bar.
NEUT13|Here it is 46, 2011, 2:42 PM Eastern Time.
NEUT14|And.
BULL15|You were really, really thrombo Ning here, and the most important thing my MTS is breaking that trend ratio high.
BEAR16|Because if you break the 10 race you after you break that ratio high then that means your teenies are going to go higher and then that means your dollar movement price is going to go higher.
NEUT17|And it also means that your call options right here $600 call options are going to continue to get inflated on the ask and then the bids have to try to come in at a higher price and give you a higher value.
NEUT18|So basically we are thrown boning the thing about it is.
NEUT19|When we were trying to take out the high here, we were at 100.
BULL20|Now we're at 95, but we gotta break that trend ratio high.
NEUT21|Say I gotta break the trend ratio high.
NEUT22|We didn't break it.
NEUT23|We were sitting right there at 37.
NEUT24|Look at that.
BEAR25|We pulled back point 79.53.
NEUT26|"Look at that."""
