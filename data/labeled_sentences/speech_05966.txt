BULL0|"""Hey fools, Austin Smith here and as part of our ask a full video series, I'm going to be responding to users."
NEUT1|Questions pulled from Facebook and Twitter up today.
NEUT2|We have one from Jessica Densmore who asks.
NEUT3|I'm interested in Procter and Gamble at Auntie Anne Pfizer.
NEUT4|Are these stocks worth holding onto anymore?
NEUT5|Well, First off, Jessica.
NEUT6|Thank you very much for the question.
BULL7|We appreciate you asking it now.
NEUT8|Taking a look at these stocks today I see some some striking similarities here right there, all big dividends.
NEUT9|There's all located on the Dow Jones industrials average.
NEUT10|They pay 3%, four point 9% in three point, 3% dividends, respectively.
NEUT11|And although they're from very different industries that are actually very similar in a fundamental level, as I said, they're all Dow dividend payers.
NEUT12|In fact he is the Dow's biggest dividend pair.
NEUT13|They all yield North of 3%.
NEUT14|They're all about $200 billion.
NEUT15|Companies trading at 20 times earnings, and all have pretty pretty strong balance sheets, and they're all regarded as very high quality blue chip companies, so lot of similarities there.
NEUT16|Even though they're across different industries.
NEUT17|But before I can actually answer your question, I have to ask one of you, and that's what's your investing.
NEUT18|Purpose if you're looking for some steady income, some safety, so that then you want the type of stocks that you don't have to babysit.
NEUT19|Maybe you're older and you're further along in your investing career.
NEUT20|You could definitely do worse than these three stocks are great companies.
NEUT21|You don't have to worry about that one quarter to quarter basis.
NEUT22|You can kind of set and forget, although you never really want to get into the fullest extent.
NEUT23|But if you're maybe a younger investor looking for a little bit more aggressive growth, you kind of want to beat the market by a bit more than just you know, 1/2 hour quarter percent every year.
NEUT24|Well, keep in mind that it's going to be really hard to grow from $200 billion, which is where all of these companies sit.
NEUT25|Especially if you're trading at 20 times earnings, they're all richly priced.
BULL26|And of course they're great companies, which is why they command a premium valuation.
BEAR27|But it's going to be hard to grow from here.
NEUT28|So before I can answer your question, you have to answer that one for some income.
NEUT29|You're looking for some stability.
NEUT30|These are great companies to hold for something a little bit more, maybe time to part ways.
NEUT31|Take it to the individual company level.
NEUT32|What I see here is I see Procter and Gamble most recently putting up 2% volume growth and pushing into emerging markets.
NEUT33|Now.
BULL34|Personally, I'd like to see more aggressive volume growth in that now their earnings growth is growing an outsized rate, but a lot of that is coming from.
NEUT35|Internal price cutting, which isn't really my favorite way for a company to grow this scale instead I own Unilever over Procter and Gamble similar valuation in a similar dividend but a little bit more organic growth and a better emerging market presence in my opinion.
NEUT36|Now with regards to Pfizer, this is not my area of expertise, but we have a phenomenal health care team that can provide you with more in depth analysis of this company.
NEUT37|But what I see is a company that's a huge mode.
BULL38|Huge return on invested capital, a very strong pipeline of Phase one and phase two drugs and a lot of cash.
NEUT39|Basically the biggest company in this space.
NEUT40|And you know, has an enormous around them, and one of the reasons that I am a shareholder today now last thing we want to att not my favorite company individually they have, you know, kind of there in a nice duopoly with Verizon.
NEUT41|You get a really nice income check from them every quarter, but if you want exposure to the space, I actually really like a company like Apple instead.
NEUT42|Apple in many instances is holding 18 Verizon over a barrel with all those subsidies for their iPhones, and there are significantly cheaper company that has significantly more growth opportunities than AT&T.
NEUT43|So 18 T's got a great dividend, but I don't really see the best.
BEAR44|Growth opportunities out there, and they're definitely going to be limited by their duopoly structure.
BEAR45|Remember the T-Mobile acquisition deal got struck down recently on concerns over Monopoly, so there's not a lot of organic growth left there, at least not as far as I can see.
NEUT46|So that's my opinion on these three companies today.
NEUT47|I think they're all great stocks, but I own Unilever over Procter and Gamble.
NEUT48|I'm a happy Pfizer shareholder and I'm not really a fan of AT&T and Verizon today, although I admit that they certainly serve a purpose.
NEUT49|If you are looking for income in your portfolio.
NEUT50|If you're looking for more analysis on any of these companies, make sure to head back to full.
NEUT51|Com.
BULL52|Thanks for tuning in.
NEUT53|"And foulon."""
