NEUT0|"""Date on Amazon, Amazon."
NEUT1|We're waiting for the earnings earnings reports on Thursday, so but as it is now, it seems to be most bullish market since last month.
NEUT2|Almost more than one month after after the, let's say little bit of bearish market due to the virus and then went back again on track bullish position as it is now, is Trent endless endless conditioner.
NEUT3|So he's in sideways trained so.
NEUT4|Really, it's not the best way to invest.
NEUT5|Overall, the market is bullish, so personnel would always invest toward the trend, so bullish condition as it is now.
BULL6|We should have voter at this point, but I think that the market will keep going up.
NEUT7|And then I think that the the earnings report will be will be positive so.
NEUT8|It will jump up for sure this for sure.
NEUT9|I mean that's not for sure, but this is what I think we should jump up as as it happened for Facebook.
BULL10|Facebook shares jumped up this morning, so I cannot say why not.
NEUT11|Amazon.
BULL12|Amazon is expected to give better results than Facebook is.
BEAR13|Facebook revenue went down compared to the last year because of less people in in less people are motivated to advertisers due to the coronavirus.
NEUT14|Nobody is traveling, nobody's buying stuff, everybody said.
NEUT15|Just watching on Facebook, but nobody thinks taking actions.
BEAR16|So this is the reason why Facebook was not really good or as revenue is lost as in the same quarter of last year.
NEUT17|But again because she was there was an ending anyway.
NEUT18|Jump it up again, I cannot.
NEUT19|I think that Amazon would follow Facebook so we can jump up and then for sure I think it's going to go more than it can.
BULL20|It can go even up another level 2450.
NEUT21|Let's see.
NEUT22|Let's see what's gonna happen after Thursday.
NEUT23|So at the end of this week.
NEUT24|But yeah, that's all for now, and I think always invest in the direction or direction that I'm just wait for that signal.
NEUT25|We should never say to you based this there this point where the volume or even significant so it would have made something.
BEAR26|Just this is what I did actually, but the video is a little bit late and anyway there was even a signal of, you know, oversold.
NEUT27|But now we are in over both and then it goes down a little bit by thinking comes up again.
NEUT28|This is my provision guys.
