BEAR0|"""Hey contessa, yeah rising bond yields challenging stocks and also challenging the Fed despite the best efforts of Fed Chair Jay Powell."
NEUT1|The past two days to calm markets down bond traders I spoke with offering this list of factors pressuring bond yields.
NEUT2|You have massive fiscal stimulus potentially on the way massive monetary stimulus in place.
NEUT3|A strong growth rebound recruiter just talking about that or CNBC rapid update.
NEUT4|Looking for six and a half percent growth this year.
NEUT5|Inflation fears, including the Fed, aiming for inflation above 2%.
NEUT6|That tells some bond traders that the.
NEUT7|Fed doesn't have its back anymore.
BEAR8|All that could lead to eventual tapering on rate hikes, which Powell tried to talk against yesterday.
NEUT9|Now Powell appeared to succeed over the two days of testimony and keeping a lid on yields, but each time he stopped talking, yields moved higher.
BEAR10|The 10 year peaking Wednesday, 143 dropping during his testimony and this afternoon around 1 1/2 I guess 1499 close enough to the highest level in a year.
BULL11|the Fed so far has seen higher yields, a sign of the improving economic outlook, so it's not been worried about it.
NEUT12|With rates still low, it doesn't see them crimping growth, but as the quick rise in bond yields shows over the past several days, the Fed doesn't have complete control of this market.
NEUT13|When bonds wanna run, they're going to run no matter what the Fed chairman says Contessa.
NEUT14|Yeah, you're starting to see a lot of you know the financial voices of authority that we listen to talking about.
NEUT15|The fact that there's been easy money for a long time, that maybe it's time to rein it in.
NEUT16|What are their options?
BULL17|We just heard Jay Powell say no, we still need to act that the economy still needs some support.
NEUT18|What level are we looking at?
NEUT19|That might prompt the Fed to act?
NEUT20|Well, I think there's a couple of things to think about here.
NEUT21|Contessa first, I think that in the market we tend to look more at GDP.
BEAR22|the Fed is looking very closely at the shortfall in jobs which are ten million.
BEAR23|That numbers been bounced around a lot an an unemployment rate is close to the 10%.
NEUT24|That's the focus of the Fed.
NEUT25|And so until that happens, I don't see anything close to reversal of policy.
NEUT26|I think that's 1/2 is that it's going to be more concerned, not with inflation, but with higher bond yields, potentially crimping, growth.
NEUT27|And I think at some point, and I don't know where that point is, and it's a big debate in the market.
NEUT28|Maybe it's a 2% ten year.
NEUT29|Maybe it's 2 1/2 percent.
NEUT30|the Fed could come in and put some pressure through buying on the long end of the curve, so it isn't.
NEUT31|We were.
NEUT32|I guess we won't forget what it was you and I were talking yesterday about the idea that what the Fed really can directly control in terms of interest rates are very short end rates, but that's not to say that they don't have influence or the ability to control rates at the longer end through buying, right?
NEUT33|That's a really good point, Tyler, and it's a relatively new development in the years that you and I have been covering, the Fed meant, might I say, decades we've been covering the Fed.
NEUT34|It used to only control short term rates.
NEUT35|Now the Fed using quantitative easing or asset purchases, if you will, can come in and buy on the long and actually sell on the short end, and it could essentially flatten the curve or drive down long wait long run bond yields.
NEUT36|It considered that earlier this year kind of backed away from it.
NEUT37|I'm not hearing talk about it.
NEUT38|At this point Tyler, it's well to remember the way to figure out what the way the Fed thinks about yields is real yields, which is the yield minus inflation.
NEUT39|So right now that real yield is negative when you get to 2%, well then you got a zero real yield, which is still by the way, very accommodative.
BULL40|But something above that might prompt the Fed to act all right, Steve, thank you very much.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
