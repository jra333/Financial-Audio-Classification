NEUT0|"""What can the president administration do to Amazon?"
NEUT1|Is this all talk or is there other actual?
NEUT2|Actually, I mean, I think what you saw this weekend was, you know, pulling out that $1.50 figure.
NEUT3|I mean the President has talked about Amazon for a long time, talked about the Washington Post for a long time.
NEUT4|It's no secret that he does not like Jeff Bezos, but specifically talking about the USPS you can start to see a potential policy here.
BEAR5|Maybe putting pressure on the Postal Service to renegotiate whatever contract it has.
NEUT6|We don't know the terms of that contract.
NEUT7|It's an independent government Department.
NEUT8|It can set its own contracts with private actors like Amazon so.
BULL9|If the USPS does somehow manage to renegotiate some kind of contract to try to pull more profit out of Amazon, the rest of the market could move in.
BEAR10|Amazon Shipping costs will go up so great.
NEUT11|This is what I understand.
BEAR12|The newest Postal Service loses money overall.
NEUT13|I mean, if you take all the packages they deliver it, they lose money on it.
BEAR14|Do they lose more money on Amazon?
NEUT15|They do on other peoples, but I mean Amazon says that the USPS is profitable on its contract, so we don't know specifically how much.
BULL16|But it seems like they're making at least a bit of profit.
NEUT17|But David, Interestingly enough, though, for Evercore just came out with a note defending Amazon and basically saying.
NEUT18|Amazon does not trade on short term earnings estimates anyway, so even if their sales tax, for example, went up or they got hit on the margin in some capacity, that's not why investors buy this stock.
NEUT19|What about that guy, right?
NEUT20|We all believe that Amazon basically could just decide to turn the spigot on and make money if they wanted to, but they invest instead to access points.
NEUT21|So does it really make a difference with a ramp up the Postal?
NEUT22|Yeah, I mean, it obviously makes it just more complicated to turn on that spigot down the road.
NEUT23|You know, in that sort of world where we see them start to decide to make profit.
NEUT24|But of course, Amazon is.
NEUT25|"You know, traded the way it is because of its dominance in whatever industry it wants to go into."""
