BULL0|"""Alright guys, welcome back, welcome back."
BULL1|Kind of a pullback of a morning, but it actually looks really strong.
NEUT2|Knowing exactly why little bit of click bait with the whole, you know, coming down don't.
NEUT3|But I don't believe we're coming down at all but one SEK, one SEK.
NEUT4|Let me get like my processor open for this.
NEUT5|How's everyone doing?
BULL6|Hope everyone's doing well doing well.
NEUT7|Making sure everything is right.
NEUT8|This looks really like the obv.
BULL9|Training like this man looks really solid, so we're going to push back up.
NEUT10|Let's say we get it pushed back to view all by.
BULL11|I think we get a break and we're pushing all time highs on asset, which is honestly absurd to think about, but yeah.
NEUT12|Also becaks.
NEUT13|So they're having that.
NEUT14|If you're in the discord he got in.
NEUT15|Obviously I'm making videos today, I don't know.
BEAR16|I hate making therapy.
NEUT17|Dogs are like they are very boring, very boring content for me to make any way so be CTX if you don't know.
NEUT18|They are having breast cancer trials or something like that right there.
NEUT19|It's a lot of high positive iti behind and good friend who trade therapeutic.
NEUT20|He's only really told me about him there.
BULL21|I'll put some money into volume, went up 10X.
NEUT22|10X today.
BULL23|So far.
NEUT24|So volume on becaks and we mentioned before, close through the roof guys through the roof.
BULL25|Today they were opening up flat like A2435.
NEUT26|It's sort of like when I looked at Yahoo Finance.
BULL27|So very happy about that.
NEUT28|Very excited about that so I didn't put tons of money and so I put a little bit like 708 hundred bucks into it.
NEUT29|It's up to 440 like honest Antonio.
NEUT30|This is going to be big.
NEUT31|I mean I'm waiting to see if we pass.
NEUT32|No, I'm not really waiting for that.
NEUT33|But I am.
NEUT34|I'm not going to agree, that's for sure, so I'm just saying be CTX fear in this one.
NEUT35|As a stock play, I mean this can make you more than like some option plays and you can put more in it and it's less risky.
NEUT36|Think about it in that type of way too.
NEUT37|I'm telling you I really like what they're doing.
NEUT38|Think there's tons of upside here.
NEUT39|Both therapeutics.
NEUT40|Have all their PS F saying bye.
NEUT41|Bye bye.
NEUT42|I was worried you weren't going to.
NEUT43|Yeah I'm gonna go I I'm going to live in the morning tomorrow.
NEUT44|I'm going to think about how I'm gonna do it.
NEUT45|How much structure it.
NEUT46|But I haven't said anything up, so I am just going to do here for now.
NEUT47|And like my semester in schools about to end, so I got all these tests.
NEUT48|I still have time to do certain things so.
NEUT49|Of the rethink everything come may.
NEUT50|Beginning of May, because I mean, I'll pretty much be able to just do this all day full time, which I'm kind of doing right now, but I still have some school overall.
NEUT51|NASA looks good, so I was looking at.
NEUT52|I mean heavily.
NEUT53|Obviously watch the videos of Neo.
BEAR54|We're getting a little bit of a drip back down there going to open up above you if we open up above you up.
BULL55|I'm very happy.
NEUT56|I definitely need to break though.
NEUT57|I really do it, just me.
BULL58|I think if masks are so push again, I believe firmly Evie gets some of that momentum.
NEUT59|Hoping, hoping it is.
NEUT60|I have a copy of AMC vote if you like to see it, what do you mean like total vote?
NEUT61|What do you mean I mean?
NEUT62|What sack?
NEUT63|Ringer is literally never on.
NEUT64|The bones of to me like it.
NEUT65|I mean, I don't think it is in until the day of to be honest, but I really don't think any of the news or nearly that really matters personally for me.
NEUT66|Any like anything you're seeing for most people is not going to matter.
NEUT67|What's important, though, I mean you can do is you can listen or text like trading.
NEUT68|I don't pay for it, it's just not something I want to use personally.
NEUT69|But if you want to, you can use or text.
NEUT70|And get your information from there.
NEUT71|Like for short interest increasing.
NEUT72|'cause I do think that it's going to like you know or text is going to.
NEUT73|Give somewhat more reliable data.
NEUT74|Security is a YouTube high stock.
NEUT75|It kind of is.
NEUT76|I mean, we've made a lot of money from it.
BEAR77|I lost like 2 grand.
NEUT78|The last call option 'cause I just held it like a Ding Dong.
NEUT79|But either way it was.
NEUT80|It had its time ahead.
NEUT81|It's fun.
NEUT82|But yeah, so right now going today few stocks are like I like crowd strike.
NEUT83|Since I think text can hold up 'cause it never hit, that two 199 marker which I wanted, but it's open root.
NEUT84|Any update?
NEUT85|What do you mean?
NEUT86|I'm going to make it update on Route One in the next video to make those going to be over the lawsuits.
NEUT87|Just to clarify things 'cause I have a lot of like really stupid statements coming out about lawsuits like saying that like you know they're like legitimate and so my guys like.
NEUT88|If we thought every company had lawsuits was sketchy to enter it, I mean.
NEUT89|You would never get into a company.
NEUT90|Yeah, I mean like in reality you have to come to that that realization.
NEUT91|You know, super important to come to that point and like realize that.
NEUT92|Opening up kind of, I'm not pushing anything right now, so I'm just kind of looking around.
NEUT93|I think steals but start bouncing.
NEUT94|The double bottom.
NEUT95|Interesting.
NEUT96|It's funny I was talking to a friend of the family.
NEUT97|He's there builders.
NEUT98|An lumber is so expensive that they're going to frame a house.
NEUT99|Right now.
NEUT100|The exterior here in Texas.
NEUT101|They're going to frame some of the exterior.
NEUT102|This is completely true.
NEUT103|With some steel beams.
NEUT104|For the instead of using like I guess thick thick lumber for like the.
NEUT105|The joycons are crazy.
NEUT106|He said it was cheaper.
NEUT107|I could not believe it.
NEUT108|I actually want to record him saying and showing the showing his quote.
NEUT109|I would love to see if he would share that with me.
NEUT110|It was insane like I was like, are you kidding me?
NEUT111|He literally going to do.
NEUT112|Yeah he may not check check my work.
NEUT113|It was even called Boy Boyd Gaming.
NEUT114|What is Boyd King?
NEUT115|I don't know what that is.
NEUT116|Sounds like a gambling thing though.
BULL117|Boy looks good.
BULL118|I think all gambolling looks good.
BULL119|I think DraftKings they all looked pretty solid yesterday.
NEUT120|Pin is only that was worried about.
NEUT121|I was watching it 'cause I had a big dump.
NEUT122|I wanted to buy it but I was like what's going on.
BULL123|To pay now, really liked, but obviously you know that's my favorite one boy, so I think they all look good.
NEUT124|They all want to break out there all sitting in this same trend like the same formation, right?
NEUT125|They all want to pop up.
BULL126|I think if this pops is going to test the local highs like 6566 range up here.
NEUT127|Personally, just me.
NEUT128|That's why that happened.
NEUT129|But be careful there.
BEAR130|Obi looks like it could potentially pull back as well.
BULL131|That's what I'm watching for on Joby BTX countering a little bit of a pullover.
NEUT132|Just think sideways moving this morning, but now it's like perking up.
BULL133|I'm happy.
BEAR134|I think I think was a little bit of a pullback today or last night.
BULL135|I think it's good.
NEUT136|The word is that the economy is so strong, but we need me, no confirmation.
NEUT137|I'm not entering anything anyway, I'm thinking about entering is is Neo because I'm such strong conviction that.
NEUT138|Get AMC guys.
NEUT139|I'm not gonna lie the drawings.
NEUT140|The drawings do wonders for AMC.
NEUT141|Expecting more drawings when it comes to AMC Apes mood.
NEUT142|Blink Blink came back down.
NEUT143|I need to open another trade in the sack.
NEUT144|They are open.
NEUT145|Review SQ square.
NEUT146|I figured a lot of square would come in, but like seeing now getting a little bit of a dip I did figure a lot of square would come in.
NEUT147|Not like crazy, surprising or anything.
BEAR148|I'm really debating the volumes on BC, TX was insane.
NEUT149|I'm curious how this moves if it moves crazy enough.
NEUT150|I'll dump some money into it.
BEAR151|Neo coming down a little bit too right now.
BEAR152|If we break below this or have retraced, I mean we might come down to 13.
NEUT153|Three was suspect we break down.
NEUT154|Queues communities in play.
BULL155|Good weekly touch.
NEUT156|I could begin that.
NEUT157|Could be a good player.
NEUT158|I think he's begging is a compromise is scary anti or breaking down.
NEUT159|The scary thing can be honest.
NEUT160|Through the four hour really quick.
BEAR161|It looks probable that we come down like 13-3.
NEUT162|So these candles hold nothing really mamc coming down.
NEUT163|Jimmy getting hurt Jimmy's not really her but will come back when we go to stream.
NEUT164|I'm telling you baby mama's home builder account?
NEUT165|Yeah, that's insane.
NEUT166|Like lumber prices are through the roof people to understand is on pumping empty Azam.
NEUT167|His arm size.
NEUT168|So I was talking to.
NEUT169|I was talking to a friend and I was trying to explain to him so it's easy to get concerned with almond oil, and I mean like go over your options and you're part of the money you should be concerned.
NEUT170|But like if you're in like you know, healthy positions like you have lots of time in years like looking at him, you know.
NEUT171|I think it's really easy to get concerned.
NEUT172|What you should do is you should just check out the dxy.
NEUT173|That's the dollar index and just fundamentally.
BEAR174|Basically, oil tends to go up when dollar value goes down.
NEUT175|It goes down OK, like that's just like you know.
NEUT176|Finance 101, so that's just one thing you should always be looking at.
BULL177|So if we have, you know the dxy dropping in the Dallas, maybe consolidating sideways is probably a good little sign.
NEUT178|You know.
NEUT179|I mean, I wouldn't be too concerned.
NEUT180|I gotta look at Zondo here in his side.
NEUT181|Tech really isn't getting hurt though.
NEUT182|I think we gotta pull back my friends takes me about more Baba and I liked his Baba play yesterday.
BEAR183|But this was the worrisome part.
NEUT184|Why wouldn't want to hold is because you're getting these crazy, you know, whipsaw action.
NEUT185|This might come down for.
NEUT186|I don't know how far this can come down.
NEUT187|I really think you are going to come down there.
BULL188|I think we're going to come down, maybe to retest at this range here 13 four, which wouldn't be all that bad, but the market is holding so strong.
NEUT189|Oh yeah, look at that.
NEUT190|Look at that.
NEUT191|This is what led us in our last play.
NEUT192|Yep, that's what this was one of the lead when I started playing oil in February.
NEUT193|This is one of the big indicators we started seeing a lot of call options are coming in on xle, which is the energy ETF.
BULL194|That was a really big indicator.
NEUT195|Yeah.
NEUT196|They need to get above them.
NEUT197|If it's with a monthly, I'll probably add more.
NEUT198|Email, yeah, we went over that GPS gap retail retail segment retail.
BEAR199|Just kind of scary for me personally.
NEUT200|Everything like a lot of stocks look.
NEUT201|Man, I dislike when people watch videos and they don't watch the whole thing.
BULL202|So yeah, I feel like a lot of stuff looks really good and a lot of reopening places.
NEUT203|MGM was one of these.
NEUT204|Yeah MGM, it was setting up the same way.
NEUT205|Skills on just text me skills.
NEUT206|Not a fan.
NEUT207|My gut tells me to pull back though.
NEUT208|It really does.
NEUT209|That's how I feel right now.
BEAR210|Beyond is up Chewy.
NEUT211|Kind of flagging doesn't look bad, be honest.
NEUT212|Gone plum.
NEUT213|To everyone, if you have specific stocks, I don't mind looking at it right now.
NEUT214|Kind of like looking over the market right now.
NEUT215|I'm not in anything, so I'm not like freaking out.
NEUT216|I feel like we're going to get a little bit of a retrace today.
NEUT217|I could be wrong though.
NEUT218|I mean, we're sitting really strong in this range, like we're sitting up here.
NEUT219|That's not bad.
NEUT220|15 minutes, 6 minutes left, I mean.
BULL221|Overall pretty solid start for the day.
NEUT222|I'm trying to look for something that G Nog Kai looks over by now.
NEUT223|I got a new price target, but this could come dumping down.
NEUT224|And I would like to capitalize if it comes jumping down.
BULL225|I really think it could actually a pretty pretty strong chances coming dumping down.
NEUT226|How's it moving yet?
NEUT227|Obv is not there.
BULL228|Nastic perking back up man crazy.
NEUT229|What's BTS at so?
BEAR230|I want to keep my eyes I think, but I think this is going to rip.
BULL231|Yeah looks so strong.
BULL232|Olivia ***** it was a stock play, you know, so it's I definitely have way bigger moves in typical.
NEUT233|But I do like it.
NEUT234|Any new news?
NEUT235|Any news?
NEUT236|'cause I want to double down to be honest in BCTABCTX.
NEUT237|I'm like itching to double down, actually.
NEUT238|No.
NEUT239|Read all of that.
NEUT240|Dance.
BEAR241|I'm telling you I want I want to play queues down to like 2/3/26 five right here.
NEUT242|I want to play it.
NEUT243|So this is this sort of mission to play or holding that 13540 so well you were holding that this 15 will be pretty important.
NEUT244|See the 15 minute hold.
NEUT245|ROM ripped crazy history I think actually what's his name?
NEUT246|Matt Course was talking about them.
BULL247|Thank you called him out.
NEUT248|Irina, whose get through this is no idea.
NEUT249|So things like an EV battery company or something.
NEUT250|Yeah, I think he called him out.
NEUT251|Prior so did you time it could you own efforts on F?
BULL252|It looks strong.
NEUT253|What is this?
NEUT254|Finance rental leasing if we're listing.
NEUT255|Sounds really terrifying.
NEUT256|Look, it looks very strong.
BULL257|Extremely strong.
BULL258|See the NASA is getting a really strong closing to 15 minute, though extremely strong close.
NEUT259|Look at that wow.
NEUT260|Popping right back up.
NEUT261|Is new about it.
NEUT262|I love Neo guy, I mean a I. I haven't pulled the trigger yet.
BEAR263|I want it so bad.
NEUT264|I wanted to like stock is finally I keep saying like stock I have tons of stock on it.
NEUT265|I just I'm not adding anymore stock.
NEUT266|They just I bought so much you know I mean like I can't I can't keep adding more right now.
BULL267|Nascc getting a really strong recovery here.
NEUT268|Wow.
NEUT269|That is surprising or moving.
NEUT270|I think Oh my God, crowd looks like such a good buy right now.
NEUT271|So crowds come right down to the.
NEUT272|Right down to the weekly level, Lucian Easy bye.
NEUT273|Only thing concerning is this.
NEUT274|So now I'm not buying this bounce rate yet.
NEUT275|Maybe I'm just scarred.
BEAR276|Crowd looks insane just for any type of rebound.
NEUT277|Think of one 94183 push.
NEUT278|Holy crap dogs like men with that right now.
BULL279|It kind of bounced back up.
NEUT280|This is a little bit delayed.
NEUT281|Tell 194K.
NEUT282|Man, I think it's by I think it's.
NEUT283|See, it's bouncing right there.
BULL284|'cause it's hitting that weekly, weekly level, it'll get a balance from that range.
NEUT285|It will get something here in a second will see men in 30.
NEUT286|But I want to see, I think crazy, but I think the safest play.
NEUT287|Is playing BCX admin.
NEUT288|This is like such a good play though.
NEUT289|On the way, this close really quick got a minute left.
NEUT290|What do you think about Upstart?
BULL291|One SEC videos really nice flow, appreciate it.
NEUT292|What time power speeches Datsun Palantir.
NEUT293|I'm 15 year Trader option expiring November.
NEUT294|When you get in there, it's like that.
NEUT295|I think it's more important question on the Palantir.
BEAR296|*** **** yeah, I was just scared to enter.
NEUT297|Those is free money right there and and.
NEUT298|What do you think about my?
NEUT299|I'm an jamiah.
NEUT300|I was eyeballing it all day yesterday for an entry all morning.
NEUT301|Then it flew.
BULL302|What a strong opening for this holy crap wincek.
NEUT303|Yeah, the markets going to the market.
NEUT304|For prices that are now crowded with 93 market.
NEUT305|To Wednesday.
BEAR306|Problem is we came up like 13-6 and we cover coming down.
NEUT307|Spread is insane.
NEUT308|I have crazy spreads.
NEUT309|I'm not ignoring you, and by the way, I'm just I'm super interested in this right now.
NEUT310|So yeah, I guess I'm kind of annoying.
NEUT311|Man, I'm.
NEUT312|Did the nastec is so strong?
NEUT313|Like honestly, it's insane how strong this is.
NEUT314|Crowd check it just to stock that I like right now.
NEUT315|Just 'cause where it's at.
BULL316|Super cheap.
NEUT317|Then asks holding up like the way it is with Bob over Bob at.
NEUT318|Getting someone to balance it has to give a weekly.
NEUT319|That's the scary part 226 like yeah 226.
NEUT320|If you can get it to 26 it has room, I mean.
NEUT321|Bubba crowd I'm I need to buy something right now because the market looks really good.
NEUT322|So primed holy crap.
NEUT323|Crazy.
NEUT324|No promises.
NEUT325|That retest budget Committee will hit like 199.
NEUT326|I don't have this week as the scary part.
NEUT327|I think Bob's a safer play too though.
NEUT328|Just 'cause it's bobbing like their sticker.
NEUT329|Like underpriced they are.
NEUT330|For the past means that is insane.
NEUT331|Absurd.
NEUT332|That local bottom down there.
NEUT333|Come back to the stream, ask Bill Gates.
NEUT334|So Bubba, are you in big plays now.
NEUT335|News on BTX.
NEUT336|No, there's no.
NEUT337|News yet official news.
BULL338|4.561 OK, well it started OK so.
NEUT339|Like it so when I'm looking for me.
NEUT340|It depends, right?
NEUT341|So when I die typically only like 6 months out?
NEUT342|'cause that's just me personally, but whenever you're doing and looking at your calls, it depends where, in my opinion 'cause how I monitor like different money, how it's moving based on data and stuff as I strictly monitor what the stock price was at.
NEUT343|You know I mean.
NEUT344|What's the word for that?
NEUT345|What's it called the spot?
NEUT346|This bottom, sorry.
NEUT347|I always want to know where that spot was, just so I know relative to where we're moving now.
NEUT348|So like the strike price, yeah, it might be $4, but you could still be out of the money.
BEAR349|You could still be losing money.
BEAR350|You know you could still be down at trade, so.
BULL351|I think personally those are picking up.
NEUT352|I think their earnings are going to be really huge.
BULL353|Their earnings coming up are going to be massive for them 'cause they need to show some strong growth, but with strong growth I think they're going to start really start picking up Steam personally.
NEUT354|My two cents.
NEUT355|It is great when we're just turning right now.
NEUT356|This is insane.
NEUT357|This is madness.
NEUT358|What's going on to be honest?
NEUT359|They'll come down a little bit.
NEUT360|AMC.
BULL361|Apex Alex really well looks phenomenal.
NEUT362|Or just stagnating man, we gotta build these huge resistances like if this is above resistance already bought I just.
NEUT363|Can you look at Starbucks Starbucks, Starbucks feel like this.
NEUT364|I've wondered the same guy always asking.
NEUT365|And if you like star I Alex or become like I might grab something.
NEUT366|To be honest, my DoorDash it if I get some DoorDash Starbucks.
NEUT367|Sounds so good I get I get the same thing.
NEUT368|By the way, if you go to Starbucks as well, I get I buy my own Creamer about my own.
NEUT369|The thing that brands like Delight I don't know.
NEUT370|Whatever Creamer I'm feeling that day, right?
NEUT371|I'm not a sociopath.
NEUT372|I can drink it black, OK?
NEUT373|I'm not judging you.
NEUT374|If you drink your coffee black.
NEUT375|Just saying I can't do it anyways so I get.
NEUT376|It's pretty much the same thing every time too.
NEUT377|Yeah, it is the same thing.
NEUT378|I very rarely switch it up.
NEUT379|Although I did get 111 of those feminine drinks for a little bit, I got the pumpkin cream cold brew that was actually pretty good for a little bit.
NEUT380|Then it got really old, but I get a black black coffee or black Pike with a shot of espresso and you about 2 inches of steam brevi like 2 inches.
NEUT381|It's a perfect amount and then when you get home you put a little bit of whatever flavor Creamer you want, like, just like a little bit perfect.
BULL382|Literally perfect.
NEUT383|It's amazing, and then if you're not eating carbs you can put like whatever like.
NEUT384|No carb Creamer.
NEUT385|You have an attitude so Starbucks looks decent.
NEUT386|You everything just looks OK, so that's the thing you gotta look at so everything looks like it's at the local high.
NEUT387|OK so everything he wants to break above.
NEUT388|Does that make sense?
NEUT389|OK, so we're all we're very high levels.
NEUT390|OK that's we have to recognize.
BULL391|OK, we're at very high levels on pretty much all the stocks.
NEUT392|So in my opinion, right now we're a few key levels on the NASDAQ.
NEUT393|About the 13-6 range and then get the 13615 range.
NEUT394|Those are the big resistances.
NEUT395|I think the Nas X old strong this is crazy.
BEAR396|We had to pull back last night.
NEUT397|If you were trading the whole bull market to the way up.
NEUT398|This is how we moved.
NEUT399|We would move down at night during London an Asian hours and then in the morning we just pop right back up and that's kind of what's happening and we look extremely strong, so that's worth noting.
NEUT400|OK, I want you guys to know.
NEUT401|This looks extremely strong, but you're you are playing a dangerous game.
NEUT402|You know that playing your playing dangerous games right now.
NEUT403|I love crowd strike right now.
NEUT404|I think I have to buy some symbolism.
NEUT405|Only me like man if we start getting that movement again we start pushing you and.
NEUT406|Tech does nothing on my aneurysm.
NEUT407|Oh look at gamblers, gamblers and strong.
NEUT408|So I've been gulping this morning too.
BEAR409|I'm just salivating in the market when I get a little bit of a dip right here.
NEUT410|Only I'm looking at.
NEUT411|If you're using tradingview like I am know that it's a little bit delayed when it comes to your stock.
NEUT412|The indexes typically aren't delayed though.
BEAR413|I want crowdcheck bad.
BEAR414|I want it bad.
BEAR415|Bad Ben.
NEUT416|In cultures getting like ticks up.
NEUT417|Yeah.
NEUT418|Neo's bouncing too.
NEUT419|So let's go to Chatter Flow really quick, so I'm not ignoring you.
NEUT420|I'm just kind of I don't miss him play today.
NEUT421|And so I think this is a trap, so be careful there.
NEUT422|Someone said Roku last night I was getting a lot of teams while Roku break out of a wedge.
NEUT423|This is one of the stocks that just mean it starts going.
NEUT424|It really starts going or just PayPal.
NEUT425|PayPal was when I was really interested in yesterday.
NEUT426|I just didn't pull the trigger.
BULL427|Thank God.
NEUT428|Yeah, if it breaks this 254.
BEAR429|Oh my gosh, it's going to soar.
NEUT430|I was looking at this is the reason so you break the ice.
NEUT431|You see this resistance where it wants to break bad.
NEUT432|It'll push like I'm not saying it pushes 270 in a day now what I'm saying but it will start flying.
NEUT433|This will start running by hard so that's worth and I really love PayPal and there there expensive though those are expensive calls so you know.
NEUT434|NASA is going to push the I think it pushes how much your PayPal.
BEAR435|I hate buying resistance.
NEUT436|We test this like 6 times.
NEUT437|This is like five times right here alone.
NEUT438|Then we had all these.
NEUT439|I had to had to go date in the the earliest I could do is be next Friday.
NEUT440|Man.
NEUT441|Yeah, 'cause I tell you I love these.
NEUT442|I love these.
BEAR443|These are like this has been on my watch list for a few days.
BEAR444|TD exploit dipping down to.
NEUT445|Let me wait a second.
NEUT446|Did you purchase reissue and I have not purchased any route yet.
NEUT447|I'll make a video that day.
NEUT448|I buy it the day I make the actual purchase of everyone else and he was going to.
NEUT449|I think Neil will run to.
NEUT450|I believe I'm the biggest activist for Neo running soon thingy so undervalued.
NEUT451|It's so undervalued Tesla to Tesla just can't.
NEUT452|It can't hold.
BEAR453|I don't understand it.
NEUT454|Can't hold 690.
NEUT455|Missouri has the whole budget, holds about 690 it'll it'll run pretty quick after that, but yeah, that's the area you're watching for there.
BULL456|PayPal is strong man.
NEUT457|I wish order all this money would have bought it five 252 out about it quick.
NEUT458|That flag, I mean, look at this flag here.
NEUT459|This breaks.
NEUT460|I mean it's going all time highs after that.
NEUT461|These are cheap too.
NEUT462|I'm looking at the price of these PayPal calls.
NEUT463|They're really not that bad.
NEUT464|Revival, if I'm leaving my I'm leaving my yeah I'm leaving my desk.
NEUT465|I'm going bye bye.
BULL466|I think we're in a break.
NEUT467|Don't care.
NEUT468|Things are run man.
NEUT469|It's crowd doing.
NEUT470|Ninety 357712.
NEUT471|People might get a little bit of mentoring.
NEUT472|How's the Dow look?
NEUT473|Coming out of it, you want to see all the moving up together so we really wanna see right now it's coming down to massive loans, really moving right now.
BEAR474|I want the PayPal is bad though.
NEUT475|Man.
NEUT476|Baba making an ice cream bar.
BULL477|Getting back above Weekly was huge.
NEUT478|'cause if you wanted there.
NEUT479|Someone commented on one of my videos like why don't you talk about the Ivy on?
NEUT480|On AMC.
NEUT481|Other humans subway or the Ivy?
NEUT482|Half the people that watch my MC videos we understand with intrinsic value is.
NEUT483|Or implied.
NEUT484|Well, most of all implied volatility, but really its intrinsic value.
NEUT485|For example, when it comes to options.
NEUT486|Message me on Discord once that goes.
NEUT487|But if you join the discord, just make sure you your name is in.
NEUT488|Read about these things.
NEUT489|We didn't do anything.
NEUT490|Major names in red and if it's not in red you don't have access.
NEUT491|Just send me a DM.
NEUT492|This looks good, though we're getting everything just retesting that daily level like Dell SP Y.
NEUT493|That's good things.
BEAR494|Look for continued crowd God Dang it.
NEUT495|Crowd also ***** being right about something in the beginning.
NEUT496|PayPal is running as well.
NEUT497|We're going to see tag do wild here pretty soon, and now the question is, would pay power play?
NEUT498|PayPal, what I'm going to probably pretty far the money.
NEUT499|I'm probably two I wanted to 272-6075 and then.
NEUT500|Look to exit, you know Soonish.
NEUT501|It's Bob that.
NEUT502|But there's a reason Bob was oh, Bill Gates sold his Baba.
NEUT503|Oh yeah, I'm not touching that.
NEUT504|Maybe tomorrow.
NEUT505|Not today.
NEUT506|Thank you forever.
NEUT507|Said that in the chat.
NEUT508|Appreciate it.
NEUT509|It's kind of late to interpret ************.
NEUT510|I'd be like 40% in PayPal.
NEUT511|Alright, just keep clicking this link.
BULL512|Everything looks so strong.
NEUT513|Holy crap.
NEUT514|500 pages in about to happen here Adobe.
NEUT515|Man, could that happen today 'cause it happened this week?
NEUT516|That's that's that's the $1,000,000 question here.
NEUT517|Do that happen this week?
NEUT518|Could make so much.
NEUT519|Holy crap, yeah, it's nice.
NEUT520|Wow.
NEUT521|This might be a really good play.
NEUT522|Adobe is a good mover.
NEUT523|Hi Debbie inputs coming in this is hedges.
NEUT524|I really like Adobe here man.
BULL525|Wow, that looks incredible.
NEUT526|I mean, you could even still have 45 really quick.
NEUT527|Only Downfall is your bum below the daily open by Mantic will hit.
NEUT528|That will break back above that will come right back.
NEUT529|Remember right again?
NEUT530|I mean Adobe.
NEUT531|CRM CRM looks good, don't share.
NEUT532|Their crowd was easiest trade today.
NEUT533|That was it.
NEUT534|I think all these Gambolling draft Kings, although they all look really good, so you know.
NEUT535|Think Adobe is a great play so I can't stop looking at it.
NEUT536|What's open door at and I got out of it.
NEUT537|Just want to see if I missed out on.
BULL538|I've played a good great.
NEUT539|PD.
NEUT540|Man might be goodbye.
NEUT541|It scared me how some of his dipping down slowly.
NEUT542|I'm looking at, but like I said, flow back into tech could be huge.
NEUT543|Peel TR.
NEUT544|Oh STK.
NEUT545|Pitons are really getting over too.
NEUT546|These cruise lines it's comical.
NEUT547|Someone from the old discord goes easy.
BEAR548|Or are you still in the Discord link two months since I left?
NEUT549|Let me answer some questions real quick so I am I entering claims, looking finish Steve Hollows as I hate SOS.
BEAR550|I absolutely hate us with their scammy company.
NEUT551|You call OK?
NEUT552|Yeah, these working.
NEUT553|Other thing AMC will still squeeze.
NEUT554|Recommend watching my videos.
NEUT555|I recommend watching the videos IPF.
NEUT556|I have some like 1000 bucks in that thing.
NEUT557|It's like 900 bucks right now, but this is what I'm watching right here holding this line.
BEAR558|We had that strong move start the week came down.
BEAR559|I cannot believe we double topped and came down astonishing.
NEUT560|I sold my alert set for breaking $0.54.
NEUT561|I'm watching right here.
BEAR562|If we break below this, I might take like 200 bucks loss so they can take 150.
NEUT563|Actually 900 bucks.
NEUT564|That's like the really cool thing about playing stocks though.
NEUT565|Like this is like man, you just like you take a loss like whatever, like me.
NEUT566|Personally I take along like dude I was like.
NEUT567|Didn't feel it.
BEAR568|Options may take a loss.
NEUT569|Slap to the face.
NEUT570|There we go, getting that balance again.
BEAR571|Man, this is crazy.
NEUT572|How strong the market is this is insane.
BEAR573|Absolute insanity I really like Adobe here.
NEUT574|Earnings.
NEUT575|Is there any earnings, aren't coming up in select?
NEUT576|For Friday.
NEUT577|So they're like crazy.
NEUT578|Clara, we're still running it absolutely insanity.
NEUT579|Crowds doing everything.
BULL580|We thought it would is awesome.
NEUT581|Do you like any lighter companies now?
NEUT582|Long term for me know.
NEUT583|I thought invoice was a good play though.
NEUT584|But he's never pulled the trigger on that one.
NEUT585|Jim, I need your back of a weekly.
NEUT586|Any coffee?
NEUT587|There's always.
NEUT588|I mean, I'm not saying you can't make money 100%.
NEUT589|I saw this happening to that was a scary part is like I saw this going on this bottoming and I know it was popping up 'cause obviously always alert from read it 'cause it's gonna pop but it's like it's just such a scary and then this $4 to like you know where's the risk?
NEUT590|You know to be honest but like.
NEUT591|The question is, can it keep going up?
NEUT592|I don't know, hard to say.
BULL593|That was a pretty strong little touch right there that looks good.
NEUT594|I would say be careful.
NEUT595|I actually like $1.00.
NEUT596|You're getting what you wanted to do.
NEUT597|Well, what I wanted is this week right?
BEAR598|You're getting that kind of trending down.
NEUT599|Bottom me on the bottom here in that little zone.
NEUT600|Maybe next week, starting volume.
BULL601|I thought the volume kicked in near the end of the week.
NEUT602|I mean, I guess the end of the week is here now, but.
NEUT603|We'll see it slower than you expected for sure.
NEUT604|Yeah, I'm shocked that he's been saying things 'cause I mean I would.
NEUT605|I would be careful 90 greedy with him.
NEUT606|Whatever you think that means.
NEUT607|Yeah, just don't, just don't get greedy with him so I can say.
BULL608|Bob and Bob looks really good.
NEUT609|The Bill Gates thing.
NEUT610|This is old news ohmygod get outta here we came in here with that you kidding me.
NEUT611|My gosh, people come in here appeals this stupid thing in the chat.
NEUT612|I really can't believe anything, anything anyone says.
NEUT613|'cause if I know you, you're probably trolling.
NEUT614|And if I don't know you, you might just saying nonsense from two months ago.
NEUT615|I'm glad you told me like Ray.
NEUT616|Jailbaits you are stupid.
NEUT617|What am I now is Adobe look at it.
NEUT618|Look at it God oh.
NEUT619|I'm just missing, I'm just not entering anything.
BEAR620|Oh my God, this is so frustrating.
NEUT621|How much is up?
NEUT622|At one point.
NEUT623|6.
NEUT624|21.6 what is DocuSign at?
NEUT625|It's like really blue.
BEAR626|This is infuriating.
NEUT627|Right now they will tell you that.
NEUT628|Hiding like a dog, he died in a good play too.
BEAR629|What a terrible day so far.
NEUT630|Like Mr Mr Miss trade.
NEUT631|Do look how strong the nasty holy crap you gals and doing nothing that was getting pooped on spies trickling back up.
NEUT632|I mean the new and then we're coming out.
NEUT633|Dead is dirt that is so cheap.
NEUT634|What is root out?
NEUT635|What's root out?
NEUT636|Let me see.
NEUT637|Just stagnating, doing the same old same old.
BULL638|Finally, they're getting tech following the indexes that, so that's why I'm just happy to see faces getting some love.
NEUT639|Yeah, I'll take should be so.
NEUT640|I need Starbucks a dump.
NEUT641|I don't think anything's gonna dump right now would be.
NEUT642|Out of the meetings in and nothing looks like it wants to dump right now.
NEUT643|I don't think right now is the market to be betting on stuff dumping.
BULL644|Crowd crowd is going bezerk holy Dad since man wish I came by I committed.
BEAR645|That is the most scared hands in the world right there.
NEUT646|We haven't had a pump day in the chat in so long.
NEUT647|We need to have a pump day.
NEUT648|Lulu killing?
NEUT649|Why is Bitcoin not moving?
NEUT650|That's that's a good question for me.
NEUT651|Why is Bitcoin going like that same bitcoins going down the windows?
BULL652|I've been watching that Microsoft looks decent.
NEUT653|It's all done.
NEUT654|That's all time I for sure.
BEAR655|I can't believe how bad knee is hurting.
NEUT656|That is insane.
BULL657|Nike is doing good.
NEUT658|Can do it too.
NEUT659|Pens looks good too.
BULL660|Big resistance coming out soon.
NEUT661|PayPal guy can't get in.
NEUT662|3/4 trades day that we just didn't touch.
NEUT663|Man made it tough.
BEAR664|We get snow, holy crap.
NEUT665|That thing wants to fly.
NEUT666|Oh my God.
NEUT667|That thing will fly.
NEUT668|Wow.
NEUT669|Oh mother.
NEUT670|I didn't cancel my orders.
NEUT671|I love to order is open and they got in God Dang it.
NEUT672|Oh, that *****.
NEUT673|Well, now I'm in Adobe.
NEUT674|I don't really want to be in Adobe.
NEUT675|Snow looks incredible.
BULL676|Absolutely incredible right here.
NEUT677|IPF Manos is, I mean, it's easy to come down I'm I'm holding mine still ma'am down.
NEUT678|200 bucks to 2:30 I mean.
NEUT679|It's 2:30 I don't care bye.
BEAR680|Tony, I think it's gonna pop off.
NEUT681|The thing is, the NFT type of crates have been going on, you know?
NEUT682|But they actually have crazy deals coming in.
NEUT683|That's like their absolute insane part about IPF IPF.
NEUT684|What are your thoughts on Hive?
NEUT685|If you have a second hive, things like a mining company already care for the miners to be honest.
NEUT686|And reading DD from read it I I'm not going to roast people on the guys like I I made a video was funny, but I'm not going to do that all day.
NEUT687|People want to sit there and read and listen to them.
NEUT688|Like you know I mean.
NEUT689|So whatever you know.
NEUT690|Everybody I have.
NEUT691|Are you going to buy more now my buying was holding I like 1000 bucks to it can't work all is doing the Chinese just 0 innovation.
NEUT692|News *****.
NEUT693|I don't think Neo *** at all.
NEUT694|That's kind of ridiculous to say.
NEUT695|I watched the Biden recovery plan SOS.
NEUT696|Why is SOS on your Biden recovery plan?
NEUT697|I'm just curious MPs, good pic though.
NEUT698|Like you're in people.
NEUT699|I do like that one.
NEUT700|I'm a fan.
NEUT701|Ready coffee this morning out of it.
BEAR702|All the charging codes are going down.
NEUT703|SOS as mentioned by someone I don't know.
NEUT704|I don't think so is going to be applied beyond for the recovery.
NEUT705|Just just be proud.
NEUT706|Don't see how they would.
NEUT707|I don't see how they would be.
NEUT708|Easy work husband.
NEUT709|I don't know where he's been.
NEUT710|I have no idea you've been working.
BULL711|I think it's been working.
NEUT712|Any juicy options?
NEUT713|Well, I accidentally just entered Adobe one to be honest and say that it's looking decent.
NEUT714|I'm not looking to stay into this though.
BULL715|NASDAQ is looking primed.
BULL716|I've literally looked at like four or five plays today alone, and they've all done well.
BEAR717|I just have been scared to enter.
NEUT718|Crowded was number one.
NEUT719|That was, that was the number one play this morning.
BULL720|We met that I can't miss that PayPal is a little bit scarier, but that one performed well.
NEUT721|They're all performing it's.
NEUT722|It's kind of like spot to break up, and I think snows the next one, but snows risky 'cause it's sitting at that green.
NEUT723|You know, the month the weekly open gets above the weekly open, though like I think some like dated calls and snow look really good.
NEUT724|Those are good like.
NEUT725|That's kind of my next play, I think is a dated call and snow.
NEUT726|I'd be willing to put like 1000 bucks on snow for you know.
NEUT727|Maybe end of April.
NEUT728|Having major fed this morning to be talking about.
NEUT729|He took Mara Mass, What's master, Mara?
NEUT730|Yeah, bruh needs to Dang volume.
NEUT731|I mean, I don't suspect like I said, like we're through with for me, it was.
NEUT732|It's a longer term play.
NEUT733|That's why I mention my buying options.
NEUT734|It was just buying stock.
NEUT735|I'm playing root.
NEUT736|That's what I'm going to do.
NEUT737|I'm not buying options on it.
NEUT738|I think I keep saying it, you know, I mean, I don't mind keep saying it, but like.
NEUT739|Making that abundantly clear, I'm not playing options on route.
NEUT740|There's no reason there's no reason 'cause where it's at.
NEUT741|That's there's so much room for it to go.
NEUT742|You know what I mean?
NEUT743|Like Flickinger, rootlike?
NEUT744|In the longer we stay down here kind of the better.
BULL745|The longer we stay in this trend on this bottom ranges trend sideways, the better it gets.
NEUT746|I mean like the borrow rate.
BULL747|It is, it is going up.
NEUT748|I know that for a fact.
BEAR749|Yeah, I thought I was really terrified.
BULL750|9.6% today.
NEUT751|It's insane, it's madness.
BULL752|It's going up.
BULL753|It's going back up.
BEAR754|It goes down.
BULL755|It goes up.
NEUT756|Just relax, telling you roots juicy.
NEUT757|Take your pill.
NEUT758|One call them or text.
NEUT759|So as you can see more data on like longer term pics.
NEUT760|So I might I might buy it.
NEUT761|I'm debating, I don't know.
NEUT762|I don't want to have like 10 softwares that will tell you that.
NEUT763|That is not what I want.
NEUT764|Actually, yeah, so it's got a lot of alignments in saying that's that high.
BEAR765|That's ridiculous.
BULL766|CRM Salesforce it well.
BULL767|Yeah Neil's doing OK. Tesla pump it up.
NEUT768|EV so so undervalued at tech is where the money is going today.
BULL769|Insanely undervalued though, man.
NEUT770|These cruise lines getting a lot.
NEUT771|You can see that cruise on money going in there.
NEUT772|Are most still getting involved in pure need trapped in that stock?
BEAR773|You do not ride this place for more than one day, that's scary.
NEUT774|But you're on something here.
NEUT775|You're crazy.
NEUT776|I wish I knew how to get these bots off the channel man.
NEUT777|I would pay like 30 bucks a month.
NEUT778|For a service that like.
NEUT779|Automatically banned people messages.
NEUT780|But then again, like if you, if you send a what if you WhatsApp me and send me money?
NEUT781|Mean like my bot or someone trying to be mean person me like come on.
NEUT782|Come on.
NEUT783|You know, come on.
NEUT784|I like Bob a lot here.
NEUT785|I like Bob a lot.
NEUT786|How much are there?
BEAR787|Baba there so cheap, yeah, I just don't know why they dumbed down and we had a bad start to the morning.
BEAR788|Was there bad news there was?
BEAR789|I couldn't find anything.
BULL790|Just get some data calls and you're fine.
NEUT791|Let me buy it.
BULL792|And they're going to do well.
NEUT793|I'll probably buy dated ones though.
NEUT794|And my friend about May 21st.
BULL795|That's far.
NEUT796|That's that's far out for me.
NEUT797|NASA just slowing down.
BULL798|I'm getting close to him.
NEUT799|I need I need coffee.
NEUT800|This is.
NEUT801|This is not fun talk coffee.
NEUT802|Don't tell you that.
NEUT803|Not one bit.
NEUT804|Gosh crowd this is.
BEAR805|This is infuriating looking at this.
NEUT806|I can't believe it.
BEAR807|I had the weakest hands in the world and enter that as tough.
NEUT808|That is tough to look at.
NEUT809|We could have gotten right.
NEUT810|Just straight scared to enter.
NEUT811|My question is how high can be CTX go up?
NEUT812|It'll probably go crazy to be honest.
NEUT813|Sorry this song.
BEAR814|I know it's annoying.
NEUT815|I could hear through my headset like wow, that is.
NEUT816|God, who knows how hard?
NEUT817|How high does he go?
NEUT818|They have so much volume flowing and that's that's the, that's the incentivizing part.
NEUT819|Of BCTX right now, just so you know.
NEUT820|DX I just bought another 900 bucks on BCT Axe.
NEUT821|Little bit of riskier play under.
NEUT822|I mean, I recognize that 100%, but.
NEUT823|I like where they're at.
NEUT824|The volume is what, speaking speaking to my soul.
NEUT825|Imagine this needs to hold if it starts breaking down, I'll just take the Li.
NEUT826|Don't care at that point.
BULL827|I'll be fine.
NEUT828|Dobie killing my soul right now, tell you that.
NEUT829|Absolutely murdering me.
BEAR830|I'm so mad I got stuck in this stupid play.
NEUT831|Honestly, I'm not interested in really anything right now just because of the way the markets are moving.
NEUT832|I mean.
BULL833|You had opportunities this morning.
NEUT834|I had tons of opportunities over here, like right when you got into the trading day, you know.
NEUT835|And I just didn't pull the trigger on anything.
NEUT836|You know, that's the way it is.
BEAR837|Sometimes tough and I think having a bad month like.
BEAR838|I mean I had a terrible March.
BEAR839|Everyone knows terrible March, so having that bad month is just a definitely.
NEUT840|Affects the way you trade effects, pulling the trigger the next time they could, especially.
BULL841|Bob again pushed back with a weekly.
BEAR842|It's pretty terrible.
NEUT843|Ever going West?
NEUT844|Eating trays video tonight with the I can't wait to watch that video.
NEUT845|By the way, I can't wait to watch TV.
NEUT846|I'm super interested to see.
BEAR847|To see that video, I'm very it's going to be pretty crazy.
NEUT848|Kind of crazy thing you tuber with Wall Street for you all.
BULL849|How far we come, there's hope.
NEUT850|He's inspiring little boys everywhere.
NEUT851|Start voice.
NEUT852|Have a go at me, I wasn't.
NEUT853|I'm sorry I wasn't that active in the chat.
NEUT854|Tyler talks out of his ****.
NEUT855|Do Jonbenet salty Jonbenet so he's an empty bag holding.
NEUT856|Did it?
NEUT857|Did it?
NEUT858|Did it?
NEUT859|IPO I'm not an IPO guy.
NEUT860|I really recommend anyone that's interested in like you know, thinking that IPO's like you make all this money off of them.
NEUT861|Look at Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger another old as dirt older but they have they wrote a report going on about how IPOs are the statistics behind IPOs and.
NEUT862|When retail can get into, it's just like getting into them and stuff, and you know the percent profitability and.
NEUT863|You know just why they don't touch him.
NEUT864|Now again, I recognize their old is dirt and I don't feel.
NEUT865|Obviously I don't follow any of their practices.
NEUT866|If you follow me at all, but you know, it's a good logistical reason with how they go over it.
NEUT867|But if you really like the company and you really like know your stuff, then it's an opportunity.
NEUT868|But like if you don't know your stuff in years like I want to play it, you know what I mean then it's like, well, you're just gambling.
NEUT869|Like the IPO on Bumble, I would've I would've bought it.
NEUT870|I would've bought it 'cause I like Bumble.
NEUT871|I know that I know the money behind the data.
NEUT872|I, that's why I was so lucrative interactive.
NEUT873|Eating bobcat bounce I do.
NEUT874|I would give longer dated I mean that time is short term trade.
NEUT875|Chinese dogs do scare me, though Trump has been scarred.
NEUT876|Tyler talks out of his booty.
NEUT877|So Coinbase bro.
NEUT878|I do like Coinbase.
BEAR879|I think Coinbase is going to be crazy.
BEAR880|I think Coinbase is going to be absolutely absurd.
NEUT881|If you looked at their look at their financials.
NEUT882|So when people aren't taking into account, make a video on this, I'll make a video on it so.
NEUT883|Well, people aren't taking into account is the price of Bitcoin going up?
NEUT884|And so when they're charging fees, I think they're taking a percent of your Bitcoin, so it's like a .00045.
NEUT885|Bitcoin will name the transaction fee exchanges do.
NEUT886|I don't know how easy change is different.
NEUT887|OK so.
NEUT888|Like there's a deposit, there's a.
NEUT889|There's a fee to buy it, but then we're transferring it from, you know, I mean, then you should pay the actual Bitcoin fee, and So what people don't understand is that because Bitcoin is at in quarter one, 2021 was at its highest level ever.
NEUT890|You know?
NEUT891|I mean like come on.
NEUT892|With that point, we do realize that mean you have to realize like because it's going so high, it's effect.
NEUT893|It's directly affecting how much revenue, like I don't know if you understand what I'm saying.
NEUT894|I'm maybe I don't know.
NEUT895|I don't know.
NEUT896|I don't know how to explain it.
NEUT897|I'll make a video on it though, but it makes sense now.
NEUT898|It's kind of like what was it at.
NEUT899|We'll come right back to this.
NEUT900|Anne.
NEUT901|In December, I mean honestly surprises the revenues and higher.
NEUT902|So in December quarter the highest we got was 26,000.
NEUT903|OK, right and then we moved all the way up to basically 60,000 right now.
BULL904|OK, so we over doubled.
BULL905|OK, the price of Bitcoin over doubled.
NEUT906|Yeah, I mean we three, they almost dead they basically they 3X their income, which makes sense.
NEUT907|So they're getting more.
NEUT908|They're getting more people coming into that are interested in Coinbase one, their interest in crypto, 'cause it's like the crypto craze.
NEUT909|Now it's like big coins all time highs every day by crypto, right?
BULL910|That's a great.
NEUT911|We're coming back to that viewpoint, correct?
NEUT912|And then you're also having the price of Bitcoin, right?
NEUT913|So the fees that you're getting back so well, let's say the fee was at 20,000.
NEUT914|You were making 30 bucks per transfer.
NEUT915|Now the now it's at now that it's at 60,000.
NEUT916|You're making 60 bucks per transit.
NEUT917|Just depends whatever that exactly.
NEUT918|I can't give you an exact number, but.
BULL919|Just to give an example, as bitcoins price increases, those fees theoretically increase because you're still getting the same chunk of Bitcoin per block trade.
NEUT920|That makes sense, and then there's fees for trading.
NEUT921|There's like tons of stuff like.
NEUT922|I mean you can go.
BULL923|Brilliant.
NEUT924|That's why the business model in my opinion was so interesting why I like them.
NEUT925|But I mean now it's like Bitcoins, so expensive.
NEUT926|You know what I mean?
NEUT927|So it's like.
NEUT928|Could could be going keep going up?
NEUT929|Yes totally could.
NEUT930|So I don't think I'm not saying that but I'm just saying that.
NEUT931|I'm saying that.
BULL932|It's hitting a pretty pivotal point right now.
NEUT933|So much sense.
BEAR934|I'm so ****** about this stupid Adobe try got into mad as hell about that.
NEUT935|I'll make a video.
NEUT936|I might make a video on that today.
NEUT937|Is that actually good video?
NEUT938|And I know a lot about Coinbase 'cause I was so invested at stupid company for so long.
NEUT939|Yeah.
NEUT940|I don't mind.
NEUT941|I'll make a video on it.
NEUT942|Oh more beasty, X-Men or more.
NEUT943|News dingbat, I know, I know, believe me, I know.
NEUT944|Getting prime time.
NEUT945|This is how in my opinion, how he moves.
NEUT946|EV theoretically follows heavily that Tesla.
NEUT947|This is the way it moves.
NEUT948|Tesla needs to hold above 690 if test like a hold of 690.
NEUT949|It has a lot of room to go up.
NEUT950|I think that's the main pivotal point we're watching right now.
BULL951|Does look good, you're getting that consolidation that looks good.
NEUT952|How's the spot?
NEUT953|I haven't looked at spy SPX today.
NEUT954|It's looking OK. You're not getting that breakout yet, though.
NEUT955|If you get a break out, we have lots of room to go.
NEUT956|But overall, it's just like.
NEUT957|Man, Talia tough to watch her.
NEUT958|Now I'm telling you I see Neo popping though.
NEUT959|Soon.
NEUT960|I think the semi conductor stuff going on is this.
NEUT961|Bud right now because they're killing their absolutely murdering across the board.
NEUT962|And I mean all of them are.
BEAR963|The demands only go keep going up.
NEUT964|So.
NEUT965|Food for thought, Neo dying it for cheap options.
NEUT966|Loading sundial a beaker integrated platform back back to gold.
NEUT967|At least going to $5.
NEUT968|The Asian broadband or something?
NEUT969|Risky, risky, risky, risky.
BULL970|Yeah it is a good down there.
BULL971|It does look good down there.
NEUT972|I had twenty coin base at 100.
NEUT973|Address in asset consulting.
NEUT974|More this week.
BEAR975|It's consolidating right now.
NEUT976|Two days, 2 days of consolidation sideways.
NEUT977|You got to break and start pushing automize.
NEUT978|You're getting consolidation right now.
NEUT979|Yeah, I mean.
NEUT980|It's happening right now.
NEUT981|Look what I mean.
NEUT982|The best unit is like I mean people like.
NEUT983|I think we tend to forget like how we moved prior.
NEUT984|Dude like how we moved before.
NEUT985|It was every day.
BULL986|Every day was a good day.
NEUT987|This is like just straight.
BEAR988|We had like 2 bad days and boom great days you know just crazy.
NEUT989|So is there so it's still going?
NEUT990|It's going to be a cool short or put it.
NEUT991|Soon.
BEAR992|Yeah, it's going to keep ripping.
NEUT993|Insane madness absolute madness.
NEUT994|It'll keep going.
NEUT995|I have a lot of requests for dividend videos.
NEUT996|I'm looking into my just.
NEUT997|I like to really like this if I'm if I'm positive on a stock.
NEUT998|I like to really like the stock, put it that way.
NEUT999|So if I make it video, I want to really like this talk.
BULL1000|Hope that makes sense.
NEUT1001|Do you know anything about pizza catch?
NEUT1002|Answer that one.
NEUT1003|MP Dumb Tony MPs, Assad company.
BULL1004|It's a great company.
NEUT1005|I talk about him like I just like.
NEUT1006|I'm just like beat people over the same block.
NEUT1007|Yes, I really like the owner.
NEUT1008|Like Neo Navy.
BEAR1009|I think Neo and EV are so undervalued.
NEUT1010|It is crazy.
BEAR1011|How undervalued they are right now.
NEUT1012|Insane and once they start moving into new crate, I love my really bad drawing circles.
NEUT1013|So I think they're going to start popping soon.
NEUT1014|You know, you might have to wait.
NEUT1015|I don't know how the flow is going to work.
NEUT1016|But MPs sod companies get above 3630 thirty, but once he gets above that I mean like last time like no one really saw coming women that first video we boom we just shot up.
NEUT1017|It was crazy.
NEUT1018|It was crazy infrastructure plan directly benefits them though directly.
NEUT1019|I guess I'm gonna hop off.
NEUT1020|I'll be back.
NEUT1021|I don't know if I'm back online.
NEUT1022|I don't know how to make videos.
NEUT1023|I got some class stuff tonight.
NEUT1024|So we'll see if you have questions this cooling down below.
BEAR1025|I'm live there all day here in Discord, DM me.
NEUT1026|Any questions you have.
NEUT1027|"I'll be in the discord to go over stuff."""
