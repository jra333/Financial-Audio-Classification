NEUT0|"""You still have Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which are two billion plus user platforms that are zero monetized to date."
BULL1|So I still think they've got plenty of revenue growth drivers going forwards.
BULL2|They're making absolutely the right investments now in the security of the platform.
NEUT3|If they don't get the security the platform right?
NEUT4|It's all over when you're having content that you're having to police now because of all the what's been happening with all the scandals.
NEUT5|It just costs more.
NEUT6|They just need to sort of.
NEUT7|Face up to the fact that they are a media company and media is an expensive prospect.
NEUT8|It's a difficult thing to edit to look at to look at carefully what's your grade on the quarter gene.
NEUT9|I'm going to say this is a C plus and the reason is that this company has gone and has historically blown through the numbers.
NEUT10|We didn't see that this on the top line amiss on the important engagement number.
NEUT11|I'm glad to hear Mark Zuckerberg talking about some of the the debate around the social value in Facebook, but putting it all together at the C Plus so that everybody is selling it off.
BULL12|I think that creates opportunity.
BULL13|This is a company that trades at a very reasonable multiple, continues to grow at an incredible pace.
NEUT14|Instagram Messenger, WhatsApp all of that.
NEUT15|And the fact that they're going to be moving more and more into the video side of things, I think this thing is very cheap at 200 bucks.
