NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|So as we head into the weekend here, what I want to really just do as you know, simplify things and no pun intended as you're going to see here, but just use the KISS method.
NEUT4|Keep it simple, stupid and the way to do that is to use a couple of these simple moving averages.
NEUT5|Again, no pun intended here, and these are, you know, these are good to use.
NEUT6|Their convenient to use because even if you have a basic surface deep understanding of technical analysis, I'm sure you've heard of both these moving averages and when a lot of people are watching the same levels and are aware of the same levels called that a cellphone prophecy caught whatever you want, you know that is, you know.
NEUT7|You know it's going to create some very dynamic price movements, and that's what we have here.
NEUT8|So the first level to just keep an eye on from the resistance side of things is this purple line here, which on my chart and notes are very well known.
NEUT9|50.
NEUT10|Moving average and right now that would be the key area of resistance valued right around.
NEUT11|Let's just call it the 123 mark.
NEUT12|So 123 going into next week is going to be the primary area of resistance.
NEUT13|In fact, you can already see back here.
NEUT14|It's you know, rejected the price down a few times, so that'll be a level that a whole lot of people will be watching.
NEUT15|Rightfully so.
NEUT16|I mean, again, it is one of those well known famous areas.
NEUT17|The 50 per moving average now on the flip side of the coin, as far as levels of support or concern, we now have this pink line down here.
NEUT18|It's on my chart, denotes the very well known 200.
NEUT19|Simple moving average.
NEUT20|Again, one of those levels were, even if it's just surface deep.
NEUT21|You've heard of that level.
NEUT22|So from the support side of things, that's going to be another area that a lot of people are going to watch it, because if the price violates through there.
BEAR23|I mean, I'm not saying that implies that Apple is going bankrupt or something, but that would imply from the technical point of view that that is going to be picking up probably more than likely some downward pressure, you know, in the bearish direction.
NEUT24|But as of right now, or if you would just want to envision these trend lines, for example.
NEUT25|So forget that they're moving averages in this.
NEUT26|Picture these trend lines were there we go now you can see that there we have this wedge formation, symmetrical triangle, whatever you want to call it taking shape but more of the story.
NEUT27|Keep running those moving averages going forward and let's see what happens with that.
NEUT28|Moving into next week.
NEUT29|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL33|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT39|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live.
