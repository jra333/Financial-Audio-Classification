BEAR0|"""Alright, if you forgot to fill up the gas tanks yesterday, you're not going to be happy this morning."
BEAR1|Prices at the pumps jumping about four cents overnight, bringing the cost of a liter of gas to a dollar 33.9 cents.
BEAR2|Drivers not happy about it.
NEUT3|Crazy, it's going up and up every day.
BEAR4|Last night I filled up with 129.
NEUT5|Would Donald training and tonight is about 34.
NEUT6|Not too happy with it, but you know, if you drive, there's not too much you can do in it.
NEUT7|It affects everything else too, so not really too much you can do.
BULL8|Now this is the highest prices have been in 3 1/2 years back in June 2014, a liter of gas ragne better dollar forty 2.9 and looks like that trend could be returning.
NEUT9|Let's bring in our friend Mike Apple over at 680 and Michael what's going on because I think a lot of people really just shocked this morning and hearing the news that this trend could continue not so great.
NEUT10|Well, pretty much every spring morning Melanie.
NEUT11|We do see the price elevated because you have a couple of things going on in the actual.
NEUT12|Making of gasoline, and that is the gas companies switching over from winter time blends over to summertime blends.
NEUT13|They are different.
BEAR14|It needs require a requires rather changes at the refinery level to make that switch, and that leads to less production.
NEUT15|Then you have the actual price for the raw material oil which this morning is better.
BEAR16|Three year high the price out of Alberta is North of $48.00 a barrel.
NEUT17|The international price North of 65 and in some cases overseas.
NEUT18|It's North of 72.
BULL19|Dollars per barrel, so we're seeing again.
BULL20|The base raw materials elevated and then of course you've got profitability for the energy companies carbon taxes into the mix supply and demand.
NEUT21|The thing.
NEUT22|I will say though, that we haven't seen in previous years is variation in prices.
NEUT23|You shop around the GTA in a downtown.
NEUT24|It's a dollar thirty three nine.
NEUT25|You go to the suburbs you're looking at less than $1.20 per liter in some cases so.
NEUT26|We don't have that across the board pricing that we once did.
BEAR27|There's a little more competition, more localized markets, and if you wait until later into the evening, typically the gas stations have actually been lowering prices after 6:00 o'clock.
BULL28|So there are some ways to mitigate the damage of rising price for gasoline.
BULL29|And again, we could see it breach $1.42 later this spring.
NEUT30|That's the longer term trend.
NEUT31|What we're watching this morning on the morning markets Facebook back in the spotlight yesterday was the first day of a couple of days of testimony for CEO Mark Zuckerberg.
NEUT32|In Washington regarding the data privacy issues, most people say you did a pretty good job in five hours of testimony for 40 US senators asking all about privacy and who controls the data on social media, what should be done about it?
BULL33|Should there be regulation over the two hours of trading activity on Facebook while Zuckerberg was on the stand shares of the social network jumped by 4 1/2% and on paper Mark Zuckerberg actually made $3 billion in the process.
BEAR34|We are this morning seeing a downdraft on stocks we've got.
BULL35|Renewed risk assessment.
BEAR36|Whether it's potential military activity involving the United States in Syria or risk assessment on the US economy, we've got Dow futures starting today, down over 200 points.
BULL37|Yesterday was a good day on diminished trade risk between the US and China, with the Dow coming off again of 428 points.
BULL38|TSX up 34 and this morning we have the Canadian Dollars 79 and a third sense US, and that is a six week high.
NEUT39|"Will send it back to the studio."""
