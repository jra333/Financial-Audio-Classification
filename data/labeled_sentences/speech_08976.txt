NEUT0|"""Alright, so I don't wanna get."
NEUT1|I had this guy on from Lordstown alright and he said orders and it became kind of odd.
NEUT2|I don't know.
NEUT3|Contentious issue now you have in your deck that you have $1.2 billion in orders but you also disclose that the UPS is principle and that they can be cancelled or modified at anytime.
NEUT4|You gotta stick by that right?
NEUT5|I mean there's an order.
NEUT6|Who knows what's going on the UPS, but they are huge back rivers.
NEUT7|Yeah, absolutely so we've actually been working together for since about 2016 and so long term relationship they actually invested in rival as well, and you know they work with us, they come to our factory.
NEUT8|We're building a vehicle that's really fit for purpose for them and you know as you mentioned ultimately what's important here is the offering and a value prop that we're giving them.
NEUT9|It's not just UPS also the other customers.
NEUT10|I mean, if you're a fleet purchase.
BULL11|Sir you can get an arrival electric vehicle with better attributes than your current diesel one at a competitive price and lower teeth total cost of ownership.
NEUT12|And you can produce it locally, so there's no reason not to shift to an electric vehicle so you know with UPS this is a long term partnership.
NEUT13|They're great partners of arrival, and we expect that to continue long term and then you add 17th March 2021 you announced the new microfactory coming in Charlotte.
NEUT14|And then you're talking about how maybe next year at this time will we be seeing these on the street?
NEUT15|Yes, so our bus actually goes into production at the end of this year.
NEUT16|I'll then in the second half of next year we were now Charlotte.
NEUT17|We're partnered with the city of Charlotte to produce the whole transportation ecosystem together so there will be more to talk about that at the right time.
NEUT18|But you know what's interesting about the microfactory.
NEUT19|You can use existing warehouses and tournaments, production facilities, and so when you look at the global scale that needs to shift to being electric, we expect to have micro factories all around the world.
NEUT20|I mean, the US is out.
NEUT21|US, UK and Europe will be our first focus, but ultimately these micro factories can be in any major city around the world.
