NEUT0|"""I also got back in the video today it is a boy."
NEUT1|Well today will be talking about ticker symbol B NGO and I'll be giving you guys some key support levels and my last defense support level where I see prices going so make sure you guys like the video.
NEUT2|Turn full summer vacation so that subscribe button and check out my Patreon link down below if you want to know what I'm buying and selling and also if you just want to support the channel that would be greatly appreciative.
BULL3|And thank you for being here.
NEUT4|So first support level I see is at 6.1 and my last defensive support is 554th.
BEAR5|If it does break this level, I think we can see price below $5 to $4 and if it breaks at $4 mark then you can probably see price all the way down to $3.00.
NEUT6|But as it's coming down.
NEUT7|Think it is time for it to come down.
NEUT8|So as this coming down, this is the area I will be buying off of at 6.1.
NEUT9|If you want that alerts into you when I'm buying a B NGO then join my Patreon link down below and you would get that alert.
NEUT10|But this is the area I plan on buying at.
BEAR11|I think this would be a good buying opportunity and buying pressure down here, but that is really the only two levels that I see and I do think it is time for it to come down.
NEUT12|It is down of aftermarket.
NEUT13|But we will see on Tuesday to confirm.
NEUT14|But just make sure you have this level 6.1 and 554 in your charts.
NEUT15|'cause this will tell us a lot as coming down.
BEAR16|If you see buying pressure right here, we can probably see higher highs, but this has fallen below list and we could probably see lower lows.
NEUT17|So that is the video.
NEUT18|Remember this recommendation by so anything is for educational purposes only.
NEUT19|"So do not try anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
