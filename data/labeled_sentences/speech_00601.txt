NEUT0|"""Have been a trend traders today we're looking at another example of our volume series comparing."
NEUT1|Yeah, typical volume.
NEUT2|Indicators that you find in a lot of chart packages to our.
BULL3|Better trend volume line which you can see here.
NEUT4|Those of you guys have seen this many times in the past year, but back on to the first pane here.
NEUT5|This one is in this year chart to package and it's called V WAP.
NEUT6|Rolling now, I'm not sure exactly what that means, but.
NEUT7|What I gather from this and it's pretty meager in a way, but.
NEUT8|Is that this dash line?
NEUT9|The yellow are the.
NEUT10|Pink and the white dashes down in this area.
NEUT11|Are spending time at the lower.
NEUT12|Edge of the bars or the candles if you will.
NEUT13|To me, you know you could interpret that as as being some somewhat supportive of price in similar fashion to the way in which our volume lines, typically.
BEAR14|Yeah, will be under under price when they're oversold Anna goodbye.
NEUT15|And alternately they're going to be overbought at above price when they're expensive.
NEUT16|Back on the violent Rolling V WAP.
NEUT17|Let's see what I gather.
NEUT18|Also, this series of bars here.
NEUT19|Seems to be largely ones in which knowledge prices going up but may not be a coincidence that the V WAP rolling.
NEUT20|Dash line is.
NEUT21|Spending time.
NEUT22|At the highs of the candles, whether or not you can say they're pulling it along or or whatever you know.
NEUT23|I'm not sure.
NEUT24|I haven't had a lot of experience with with this one, but what the overall?
NEUT25|Importances that you compare different lines in different chart.
NEUT26|Indicators volume indicators.
NEUT27|And.
NEUT28|A lot of times you can manipulate him and you can understand well you know what they're doing and maybe get something out of them.
NEUT29|Still in our lives, you know, revert back to the ones that we use and bend the trend.
NEUT30|I've not seen anything that is easy to interpret.
NEUT31|An is accurate as our volume lines.
NEUT32|"That's all for today."""
