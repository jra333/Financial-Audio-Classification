BEAR0|"""I see a trend in the general financial services industry which is trickling down into the gold space."
NEUT1|And this is the trend toward smallness.
NEUT2|By this I mean fractional ownership in the same way that Robin Hood is made.
NEUT3|Shares look attractive younger people because they don't have to invest so much.
NEUT4|Outfits like Acorns are doing the same thing in the precious metal space.
NEUT5|They're saying you don't have to have a huge investment to take part in gold and silver.
NEUT6|I wouldn't necessarily agree with that because of the charges, but it's undoubtedly a trend.
NEUT7|Central banks will drive the agenda for this year across the world they have subsidized and printed trillions of dollars.
NEUT8|And all this is somehow going to be paid back when millions are unemployed and bankruptcies, or at an all time high.
NEUT9|There's no tax money coming in.
NEUT10|How are they going to pay this back in October of 2020 U.S. National debt reached an all time high of $27 trillion.
BULL11|That's an increase of almost 36% in the last four years.
NEUT12|Washington's only recourse will be to look at gold backed currencies, a reversion back to the gold standard, even if it doesn't happen next year.
NEUT13|It's definitely going to forefront of a lot of discussions within the government, and this last trend is a trend of safety, financially and socially.
NEUT14|I can't remember the world being such a dangerous place.
NEUT15|The age of our reliance on banks and governments to sort out problems is eventually going to come to an end.
BEAR16|Governments cannot afford social care and pensions anymore, and banks are going to be hammered by the fallout from the coronavirus.
BEAR17|I can see many banks failing next year and also going forward.
NEUT18|People are beginning to wise up to the advantages of having a safety net like precious metals around to barter and also active security and this is going to be a big trend in the next several years so don't get left behind, don't leave yourself vulnerable with others, keep themselves entirely safe.
NEUT19|Invest in gold to hedge yourself against inflation or an economic downturn.
BULL20|And thankfully we have actual real gold for you.
