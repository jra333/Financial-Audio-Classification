NEUT0|"""Chamath you mentioned Rocket Fuel an I'm going to."
BULL1|It's a loaded question, but nonetheless maybe the epitome of all of this is Tesla, which is up 700 plus percent over the last year.
NEUT2|I think you're still a shareholder, right?
NEUT3|If you sold any shares.
NEUT4|So what do you make of?
BULL5|That in and of itself 700% in a year.
NEUT6|Elon Musk is now the richest person in the world.
NEUT7|As of today passes Jeff Bezos.
NEUT8|Yeah, it's really.
NEUT9|It's really incredible actually.
NEUT10|I mean, he's somebody I've known for a really long time.
NEUT11|I've looked up to him for a long time, and here's what I would say that he built a great car company and somewhere along the way you know about five or six years ago what I thought he was building was an energy company and that eventually people would realize that climate change actually mattered and it's taken five or six years for everybody to realize the same thing, and he's being rewarded.
NEUT12|You know, the world's richest person should be somebody that's fixing and fighting climate change.
NEUT13|I think the reality is that Tesla is a distributed energy business, right?
NEUT14|They are figuring out how to harness energy, how to store it and then how to use it in a way to allow humans to be productive.
NEUT15|Cars are a manifestation, but you know solar panels are as well.
NEUT16|Power walls are as well and I'm telling you right now it's got the big disruption that's coming is to power utilities.
NEUT17|There are trillions of dollars of bonds of CapEx of value.
NEUT18|Sitting inside the energy generation infrastructure of the world that is going to go upside down.
NEUT19|And when that goes pear shaped, Tesla will double and triple again.
NEUT20|And I think you know, I tweeted this awhile ago that I thought the world's first trillionaire would be a person fighting climate change.
NEUT21|It very well could be Elon, but if it's not him, it'll be somebody like him.
BULL22|But it'll be because of this delivering clean energy, allowing the world to be sustainable is an incredibly important thing that will be rewarded by markets and individuals.
NEUT23|And you're you're just going to ride.
NEUT24|You said two or three times higher than where it is now.
NEUT25|You're just going to ride.
NEUT26|Listen that wave.
NEUT27|Scott, I don't understand why people are so focused on selling things that work.
NEUT28|Let's just, you know, I'll make up a number.
NEUT29|Let's just say I owned a billion dollars of Tesla stock.
BEAR30|If I sold it now I have a billion dollar problem.
NEUT31|What do I do with that money?
NEUT32|What about if it was 100,000,000?
NEUT33|What about if it was just 10,010 billion?
NEUT34|It doesn't matter what the number is.
NEUT35|The point is that when things are working.
NEUT36|You're paid to stay with people that know what they're doing, and this is a guy who has consistently been one of the most important entrepreneurs in the world.
NEUT37|And so why bet against him?
NEUT38|It's the same thing with Bezos.
NEUT39|Why bet against him?
NEUT40|And there are a handful of other people.
NEUT41|Anthony Noto, who we just talked to today, is in yet another person.
NEUT42|You get behind these people who have incredibly strong character who know what they're doing who aren't going to bend to short term profits.
NEUT43|And we're just going to drive the train for 10 or 20 years and make the world a better place.
NEUT44|Get behind them.
NEUT45|You know the best way to summarize this, by the way, is a friend of ours.
NEUT46|We mentioned earlier.
NEUT47|Bill Gurley has this great phrase when the music's on, you gotta dance.
NEUT48|And so these guys are dancing, they are in rhythm.
NEUT49|They're in flow.
NEUT50|Let them do their thing, get behind them.
NEUT51|Don't sell a share.
NEUT52|"Just let him create value."""
