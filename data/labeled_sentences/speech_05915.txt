NEUT0|"""If the mortgage bonds that Michael Berry discovered with the match."
NEUT1|How much bigger is market for insuring mortgage bonds that actually mortgages?
NEUT2|20 times if the mortgage bond with the match and the CDO's were the kerosene soaked rags than the synthetic CDO was the atomic bomb, the Trump president holding his finger over the button.
BEAR3|It was at that moment in that dumb restaurant with that stupid look on his face and Mark Bomb realized the whole world economy might collapse.
NEUT4|And I know what you're thinking.
NEUT5|What the **** is a synthetic CDO?
NEUT6|Well, here's Doctor Richard Thaler, father of behavioral economics, and Selena Gomez to explain.
NEUT7|OK, so here's how synthetic CDO works.
NEUT8|Let's say I bet 10 million on the blackjack 10 million, because this hand is meant to represent a single mortgage bond.
BULL9|OK, Selina has a pretty good hand here, showing 18 dealer showing seven.
BULL10|That's a really good hand for Celina.
BULL11|Good odds Infector chances of winning this hand, or 87%, so my odds are good.
BULL12|I'm on a winning streak.
NEUT13|Everybody in this place wants to get in on the action.
NEUT14|How could I lose right now?
NEUT15|This is a classic error in basketball is called the Hot Hand Fallacy.
NEUT16|A player makes a bunch of shots in the row.
NEUT17|People are sure they're gonna make the next one.
NEUT18|People think whatever is happening now.
NEUT19|Is going to continue to happen into the future during the real estate boom, markets were going up and up and people thought they would never go down.
NEUT20|So people who are watching and think that I won't lose will make a side bet.
NEUT21|Now this is the first synthetic CDO.
NEUT22|I love Selena Gomez.
NEUT23|I bet you fifty million she wins and I'll give you a three to one Odds reader 1 odds.
NEUT24|OK, I'll take that bet now.
NEUT25|Somebody else is going to want to make a bet on the outcome of their best million.
NEUT26|She wins.
NEUT27|That will lead to synthetic CDO number two.
NEUT28|Hey, I bet you 200,000,000 that Lady in the glasses wins that bet.
BULL29|She probably will win, so I want a great payoff about 21 deal and this will go on and on more and more synthetic CDO's and we can transform an original $10 million investment into billions of dollars.
NEUT30|OK.
NEUT31|"No."""
