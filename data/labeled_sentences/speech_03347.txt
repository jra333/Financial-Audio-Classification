NEUT0|"""Joining us now with more is Forbes Sports business Reporter."
NEUT1|He's champ Tom vanriper.
NEUT2|It is Friday.
NEUT3|I need to get out of here.
NEUT4|It's almost like the game.
NEUT5|First of all, let's talk about.
NEUT6|I mean, how much bedding is actually done?
NEUT7|Tom, on the Superbowl, insiders people have their pulse on these things.
NEUT8|People who run bidding websites says about $10 billion each year for the Super Bowl.
NEUT9|Is yes, a little bit of a guesstimate because you can't track all these things exclusively.
NEUT10|Of course, a lot most of it's illegal in 99% of the money.
NEUT11|Bet on the Super Bowl is illegal money, but on websites people calling their bookies, but most people in the business think it's about $10 billion.
NEUT12|So how much comes from these side bets that we're talking about here, not necessarily betting on who's going to win with a registered bookie but close to half of it 40%.
NEUT13|Most people tell me is bet not on the outcome of the game culture favored by 5 1/2, but people betting on these little side.
NEUT14|Bet some of them people know about, you know who's going to win the coin flip?
NEUT15|Who might the MVP be?
NEUT16|Who's going to score the first touchdown?
NEUT17|It ranges from things like that to really crazy stuff like how many times is Kim Kardashian going to be on screen outfit?
NEUT18|Yes, so lots of lots of people hundreds involved in this year's game.
NEUT19|Are you serious, Kim Kardashian Dana who she dates?
NEUT20|I don't know who Kim Kardashian, Reggie Bush, Oh well.
NEUT21|Who do?
NEUT22|I thought he knew everything.
NEUT23|Alright, let's talk though about these kind of crazy side bets.
NEUT24|The conventional one 'cause I wanna talk about the odds like who's going to win the Super Bowl MVP.
NEUT25|I mean talk to us a little bit about that in terms of like some of you know, the odds that are out there.
NEUT26|But this one.
NEUT27|Yeah, naturally, the quarterbacks disco position guys are the ones who are most favorite.
NEUT28|Peyton Manning, certainly called Drew Brees, right?
NEUT29|I think a couple of the running backs on each team, mainly as the quarterbacks mean the smart money is on paid Manning above anyone else.
NEUT30|As far as the fee, I wonder you know how much of this betting takes place in countries that don't typically watch football because the British.
NEUT31|Will bet on almost anything and they can through all their little betting agencies.
NEUT32|They got William Hill and such.
NEUT33|It's not all in the states.
NEUT34|I'm guessing this 10 billion.
NEUT35|No definite almost days 'cause it's most of it is on the Internet so people logged on from all over the world how it breaks down country by country.
NEUT36|Honestly I'm not sure at least 10 or 15% of the money that's coming from overseas is tide to kind of just got a few seconds left here.
NEUT37|But I mean do it when the economy is down.
BEAR38|We see less bedding or not.
NEUT39|This is not so much in terms of the legal betting in Vegas that goes down when the economy goes down because people are spending money to go to Vegas for hotels, for flights and so forth.
NEUT40|That's more of a parameter of the economy, the sort of the worldwide betting, 99% of which is illegal.
NEUT41|Yeah, OK, could leave it there.
NEUT42|Interesting stuff, Tom.
BULL43|Thank you so much.
NEUT44|Appreciate it.
NEUT45|"Tom vanriper."""
