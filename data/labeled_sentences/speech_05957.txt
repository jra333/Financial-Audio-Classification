BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome to the shortest review."
NEUT1|Coca-Cola ticker symbol Ko was like, subscribe and comment.
NEUT2|When it comes to brand recognition, Coke takes one of the top spots on the list.
NEUT3|There's only two places in the world that do not sell Coke.
NEUT4|One of them is the common place of North Korea and Iran.
NEUT5|And yes, it ***** for them.
NEUT6|When it comes to their products, not just Coke that their famous board, they also have fanes pride, power rate, smarter water.
NEUT7|Does any water gold peak tea is among many others in the soft drink market.
NEUT8|The only real competition that Coke has Pepsi.
NEUT9|Now when comparing both share, a Coke is $4465 share.
NEUT10|Pepsi is one 2956.
NEUT11|Does that mean that Pepsi is bigger?
NEUT12|Not exactly when looking at the market cap Coke has a market cap of 191.77 while Pepsi has a market cap 180.65 now what is the market cap market cap is?
NEUT13|If you want to buy everything if you add everything the company owns combined the total value of it.
NEUT14|That's what the market cap is.
NEUT15|So if you wanted to pay cash for Coke, the entire company you will need 191 point $77 billion cash.
NEUT16|Warren Buffett I call him Daddy Buffett, one of the greatest investors of all time, is actually invested in Coke himself.
NEUT17|Back in the late 80s, Daddy bought a billion dollars worth of shares of Coke.
NEUT18|This has actually made Coke.
NEUT19|One of Buffett's greatest acquisitions when you had the support of Warren Buffett at three point, 59% of dividend yield potential has little with the world being a dividend King.
BULL20|An franchise now to save operating codes, I do think Coke is actually a buy in my humble opinion.
NEUT21|In case you were wondering, a dividend King is a company that has been paying dividends.
BEAR22|I'm sorry, increasing dividends for over 50 years.
BULL23|Coke has actually been increasing dividends for the past 57 years.
NEUT24|Even though I'm a shareholder of Coke myself, one thing I do not like as a pair ratio.
BEAR25|I personally think is a little too high is 87.17% way above the 60% that I usually like.
NEUT26|Now what the payout ratio get better?
NEUT27|So yeah, I think so.
BEAR28|Once the economy opens back up and people start going up to restaurants more often than not, yes, I do think the pair ratios go lower due to the higher sales.
NEUT29|Now, when it comes to dividend history, as we talked earlier, yes Coke is active in King and I truly do think they're going to try to keep that up to keep the status as well.
NEUT30|Now looking at 12 ranked analysts opinion, the highs are shooting for is going to be 57 is shared at the lowest one is 46.
NEUT31|My opinion I'm sticking with the bullish thesis on this one.
BULL32|Now the last few weeks Coke has not really performed that well.
NEUT33|However, I do see the rate as a buying the particularly I do when he crossed my position right now, own 26 shares and I get 1066 every quarter as a form of dividend.
NEUT34|And as you guys know, I like to keep this beta.
