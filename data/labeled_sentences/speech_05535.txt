BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about People's United Financial or their ticker symbol, which is PBC T and.
NEUT2|I never figured out what the C stands for or the T really, but I'm guessing it's Peoples Bank of Connecticut.
NEUT3|I don't know who knows.
NEUT4|I don't think it matters either, so their bank obviously current stock price $14.83, which gives them market cap of $6.3 billion.
NEUT5|So obviously not a big bank.
BULL6|Revenue $2 billion up like 10% earnings $573 million up like 10% and current P is 11 with a forward PE of 12 or you know slightly over 11.5.
NEUT7|Obviously not a problem.
BULL8|And obviously in line with the big banks like Goldman Sachs and whatnot so.
NEUT9|The banks tend to hover around the 12 PE, which is obviously not terrible dividend yield, just under 5% with the payout ratio of 54%, which is pretty nice and also their dividend aristocrats, so they have increased their dividend every year in the past 25 years, and yet the payout ratio is still pretty decent, so I actually used to own the stock and I used to own it because their dividend aristocrat and I was going to own it.
NEUT10|For a very long time, and I'll probably buy some more shares at some point.
NEUT11|Total assets $63.4 billion.
BULL12|Total liabilities $55.5 billion, which gives them in total stockholders equity of just under $8 billion, which is up from over $7.9 billion.
BEAR13|So there's a very minor difference there in current year versus last year also.
BULL14|Stockholders equity higher than the market cap, which is obviously a good thing and assets liabilities being fairly balanced.
NEUT15|Obviously also bank thing.
NEUT16|Can't really ask for that much more and you know, like Goldman Sachs assets and liabilities are outrageous so not a terrible thing.
NEUT17|Pretty much in line with banks, you know.
NEUT18|Risk factors.
BEAR19|I'm guessing a global financial crisis where they have to write off a lot of the loans.
NEUT20|They can't really think of too many other risk factors there.
NEUT21|Obviously they're fairly small so.
BEAR22|They guess they could be disrupted kind of sort of a little.
NEUT23|That doesn't really happen to banks though, so I don't see any risk factors here.
NEUT24|Overall, I don't think there's enough growth for growth investor for a dividend investor.
NEUT25|I think this is a very interesting stock and I definitely think you should look into it.
BEAR26|Paid ratio is fairly low with a 5% dividend yield, which is pretty nice.
NEUT27|Balance sheet is a.
NEUT28|It's a bank, you know.
BULL29|Revenue growth is pretty nice, and so I think it has pretty much everything for a dividend investor.
NEUT30|For a value investor, the balance sheet is a revenue.
NEUT31|Growth is nice price to earnings is nice.
BULL32|Dividend is nice.
NEUT33|Bonus on top of that.
NEUT34|Again, very interesting sock.
NEUT35|Wouldn't blame anyone from looking into that and getting that 5% dividend I guess.
NEUT36|So as I said, very interesting sock for pretty much anyone.
NEUT37|That's it for me.
