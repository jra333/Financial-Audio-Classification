NEUT0|"""So hello everyone, welcome to a new video of Indian animation news updates."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about Japanese anime, so you may be wondering why I'm talking about Japanese anime.
NEUT2|The channel is about Indian animation, new service.
NEUT3|I talk about animals and obviously I'll talk about Japanese sending me wow what, what, what what you're thinking.
NEUT4|But the difference in this video is that we're not going to talk about Indian television.
NEUT5|We're going to talk about an international news that is to be precise.
NEUT6|Japanese anime news.
NEUT7|OK, particular enemies coming on Japan, and I'm going to discuss it.
NEUT8|So you may be wondering why why I'm discussing this?
NEUT9|OK, there a lot of anime comes on Japan.
NEUT10|I never talk about them.
NEUT11|So why today?
NEUT12|I'm specifically talking about this particular anime because this particular enemies about an Indian support.
NEUT13|Let me tell you what the sport is about.
NEUT14|The sport is about comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy, comedy.
NEUT15|So that's why we're gonna discuss about this particular anime, because this particular anime is about comedy and Indian sport.
NEUT16|So that's why it's come under Indiana news updates.
NEUT17|I'm really amazed to see that that only a few Indian animal Youtubers and maybe do regarding this.
NEUT18|Wow you only talk about Pokémon, right?
NEUT19|And Pokémon in Durham under major anime because there's so little get views so the Japanese name of this anime Shakunetsu comedy.
NEUT20|If I translate it to English Burning Committee, the name is really awesome burning company because while playing coveri you feel the hit.
NEUT21|So basically with some funny incident happened regarding this.
NEUT22|Anyway, this particular anime has created a Twitter profile OK, and in the Twitter profile departure anime has posted to its in Hindi language to be precise, using Deb Nagri script.
NEUT23|So the enemy is not coming in Hindi dubbed, but they've used in Agra script to target Indian audience.
BEAR24|Cost since the last couple of years.
BULL25|India wants Anime campaign growing rapidly so that Indian people will be hyped towards this particular anime or get to know about this anime.
NEUT26|But this enemy is not coming on Indian television.
NEUT27|So what you're suggesting?
NEUT28|So I really want to know that are they trying to tell the audience that towards the animal using piracy because there's only option because we don't have any legal streaming platform which is going to telecast this particular anime.
NEUT29|No, there's no legal streaming platform, so that's the only way.
BEAR30|And a misconception they were having.
NEUT31|So basically Hindi is not only language in India.
NEUT32|People should understand that there are more than 20 language, 20 or 30 language in India more than 30 language in India and so is not coming in Hindi dub.
NEUT33|So what's the point of writing it in debugger script?
NEUT34|You could have used English language 'cause initially international language, an air.
NEUT35|It's common to all the Indian people.
NEUT36|So it's really funny.
BEAR37|And Moreover the dimness script they use is really missing generated because if you see this screenshot.
NEUT38|You notice that it is wrongly written that OT the body and the connecting signs are all messed up, so this is completely missing generated, so I guess after you some translator to translate from Japanese to Hindi and this is the end result.
NEUT39|So anyway this particular enemies broadcasting on 2nd of April or 3rd of April because there's a time difference.
NEUT40|So actually it is coming in between 2nd April and heard April OK and you can check out this anime be 'cause it's about Indian sport so.
NEUT41|Definitely should take it out, so that's all for today.
NEUT42|Does Iprex inform you all regarding and Japanese anime based on Indian sports?
NEUT43|I really hope that you would all love it and I think this might come in Indian television because it's about an Indian sport.
NEUT44|There's only 10% chance that this is going to happen 10% because 90% sure that.
NEUT45|"No, so keep on supporting the new service from time to time, OK?"""
