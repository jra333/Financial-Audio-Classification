BULL0|"""Welcome traders to freetradingvideos.com is that Raider took in BX sometime ago and the stock was in a very nice uptrend as evidenced by all these in line moving averages."
BULL1|There are rising and in line also is a nice series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows through here indicating that this is a nice uptrend and at least in the near term the stock put in a very good bullish retracement.
NEUT2|Alright, so I'm looking now.
BEAR3|For all the people who have gotten hurt in this area appear.
NEUT4|Alright, you're looking to have the stock come back.
NEUT5|And then run back up to let them out of pain.
NEUT6|All the people who shorted the stock down in this area anywhere through here.
NEUT7|Are now looking for any reason that they might be able to minimize their loss, and so on pullbacks very often you'll get a higher swing low because the people who are hurt will buy to cover.
BULL8|Happy that they got a chance to minimize the damage that was occurring.
NEUT9|Their account.
NEUT10|Alright, so this is the crux of the bull pull back.
NEUT11|I'm looking to get into this stock if you can take out the high of this.
NEUT12|Bar pronounce protected.
NEUT13|Stop building swing low if that if that works out the next day I do get filled on that trade.
NEUT14|Alright, my stop limit order goes in.
NEUT15|Unfilled my automatic protective stop goes into place to protect me in case the stock head South.
NEUT16|Runs right up into the next logical place with resistance almost to the penny.
NEUT17|After writing this nicely and move my stop just a little bit below in this area chasing the 20 Ma now.
BULL18|Nice Pierce up there to get rid of that overhead resistance.
NEUT19|Any that might be there and the stock finally takes off now were much better than break even on this trade and I actually exited half of my trade on this day right here.
NEUT20|Pretty good right?
NEUT21|Walk away with little money.
BULL22|Easily pay for commissions and much more, and I'm giving myself a chance to say in the other half of that trade and make some nicer gains.
BEAR23|So it's looking good at this point I move my stop up again and I get stopped out of it on that day right there, so I didn't give it much of a chance.
NEUT24|In fact, that's one thing I could have done better on this trade, and you'll see what happens here.
NEUT25|This talk actually pulled back again, right at my side resistance, and then gap down.
BEAR26|So either way, I would have gotten sucked out here or definitely here.
BEAR27|Alright, very good, so I'm out of it.
BULL28|In this scenario it would have been an exact same money off the table, but I did give myself a chance to stay in the trade and possibly face well.
