NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's December 15th, 2016.
NEUT2|I'm Celina Miklas technical analyst at xm.com and today we look at the euro versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR3|We can see that Euro USD tumbled below the key 1.05 level an it reached the lowest level this year.
BEAR4|So far, the pair touched a low of 1.0 Four 67 early in the Asian session today.
BEAR5|And it came close to last year's low of 1.04, sixty one.
BEAR6|If the market falls below this low from last year 2015 low, it would be the lowest level since March 2003.
NEUT7|See that here.
BEAR8|If we look at the overall market structure back to the daily chart, we can see it is bearish befalling moving averages are also highlighting this fact, and we also saw a bearish crossover of the 50 day moving average with the 200 day, so it fell.
BEAR9|The 50 day fell below the 200 day in October, giving a bearish signal an the RSI is below 50.
NEUT10|This is the threshold that.
NEUT11|That separates the bullish from bearish territory.
BULL12|So now we have our sign bearish territory.
BEAR13|The markets break below the key support of 1.05 has strengthened the bearish bias overall and the break of the 2015 low last year's low of 1.0461 would open the way towards the 2003 low of 1.03 thirty four.
BULL14|Overall, outlook will remain bearish unless the market can rise above 1.09, but before this level we can see there are other important resistance level.
NEUT15|Of course the immediate resistance would come in at 1.05 and then 1.06 seventy.
BULL16|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
