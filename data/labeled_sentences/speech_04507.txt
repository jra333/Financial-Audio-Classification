BULL0|"""OK, if we assume unity can keep going to 39% clip then you have to figure they can generate 753,000,000 in revenue this year."
NEUT1|So at the IPO price it was already trading at 18 times sales an if today's run it's trading at 24 times sales people.
NEUT2|Can't pay that.
NEUT3|It's incredibly expensive, even if it seems reasonable comparisons something like a snowflake or even Amber, which we talked about last night.
BEAR4|But that's a week company.
NEUT5|Not many stocks traded more than 20 times.
BULL6|Sales at these levels units got assumer valuation to some of the hottest cloud stocks around their Z scaler Viva Systems Cloud Fair.
NEUT7|The trade desk.
BULL8|While unit is definitely a good company, I don't think it's Z scaler good.
NEUT9|It's not cloud for good either.
NEUT10|An it's not 24 times sales good.
NEUT11|I know you probably think I'm dumping on, it's just that.
NEUT12|Price matters so much to me because I've been in the business for a long time and if you get the wrong price for a good company doesn't matter.
NEUT13|You can lose money.
NEUT14|If you want to Sky high valuations, software space you either need ultra fast revenue growth or you need substantial earnings.
NEUT15|You need simply not at that level.
BULL16|Again, not knocking unity.
NEUT17|I'm not communities price now there's a rule of thumb we have for software as a service industry.
NEUT18|It's called the rule of 40.
NEUT19|You take the revenue growth and then you add the operating margin and if the sum is above 40 then the company passes the test that we like on may have money.
BEAR20|Unity flunks the rule of 40 tests.
BEAR21|It's going into 39% clip with a negative 6.4% operating margin if they can maintain the current growth rate and generate some positive earnings before interest in taxes, then I'd be willing to bless paying up for this one, but they're not there yet.
NEUT22|For now I can't get behind unity 24 times sales or even 18 times sales where it came public this morning.
NEUT23|There are software as a service companies with better numbers and cheaper stocks that are more seasoned with terrific people running up.
NEUT24|Again, I want to like this one.
BULL25|Unity is carved out a terrific niche for itself in the video game space.
NEUT26|It's a way to play the industry as a whole without betting on specific titles, especially the less glamorous, but much faster growing mobile game space rather than going head to head against the Big Dogs units taking massive market share with smaller independent game studios that don't want to pay up for license, fancier engines from the competition, and there's some real opportunity beyond gaming which I like.
NEUT27|But the bottom line.
NEUT28|Like all the other red hot IPOs we've seen this week, you need to let unity cool down before you even think about touching it.
NEUT29|I consider this one enticing around $50 or maybe less.
BEAR30|I know that's a turnoff for some of you, but you know what I think.
NEUT31|Patience is a virtue.
NEUT32|Don't miss a second of mad money.
