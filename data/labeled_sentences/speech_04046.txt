NEUT0|"""Part I have a third account."
NEUT1|There's a man.
NEUT2|Power another Los Angeles for years named Howard Ahmanson.
NEUT3|He once said something that I've taken to my heart.
NEUT4|Add.
NEUT5|Never underestimate the man over his doings himself.
NEUT6|I think Elon Musk is peculiar in.
NEUT7|You may overestimate yourself, but you may not be wrong all the time.
NEUT8|Well that was Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger weighing in on Tesla and Elon Musk, coming just before the company announced its offering of $2 billion worth of common stock this morning, philipo has more on that from Chicago, Phil.
BEAR9|Ann Morgan those shares were under pressure premarket when this deal was first announced.
BULL10|Now they're up almost what more than 2% on the day.
NEUT11|This is a $2 billion common stock offering that Tesla has announced.
NEUT12|By the way, Elon Musk, he's going to be buying $10 million of that stock offering.
NEUT13|Remember, it was just a couple of weeks ago after their quarterly earnings.
