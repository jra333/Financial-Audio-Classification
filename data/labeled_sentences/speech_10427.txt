BULL0|"""Alright, time for a mad dash to get you ready for the opening Bell as well."
NEUT1|7 minutes from now.
NEUT2|Darden, yes.
BULL3|I'm hoping the young people regroup, and if they do we will go to where my daughter and I love to go, which is Olive Garden, which had numbers.
NEUT4|Believe it or not, that are regarded as being pretty good.
NEUT5|They had minus 26 who are looking for minus 29.
NEUT6|But David, this is all about last man standing.
NEUT7|I may wear this suit.
NEUT8|Wanna go to Olive Garden because you can stuff the roles and look at this.
NEUT9|I mean it was like the guy could pocket room there for Margaret, but here's what matters David.
NEUT10|They did $2.10.
NEUT11|People looking for Dollar 95.
BULL12|They actually jacked their dividend from $0.37 all the way back to $0.88, which was what it was before.
NEUT13|Before the pandemic, and if you looked at this chart on a longer term basis to where it was a year ago, you're beginning to see David a serious separation from the companies that are solvent to the ones that are under David.
NEUT14|You want Italian food in this country now.
NEUT15|You think you can go to 150,000 restaurants that went under you think you can go to the longshoreman my Italian Bistro that could allow.
NEUT16|You going to Olive Garden?
NEUT17|Yeah, they never ending salad bowl.
NEUT18|David, the little things they have on the table you can play games.
BEAR19|Do not talk to your parents so nice.
NEUT20|It's just a fabulous place to eat and it's killing it is question it.
NEUT21|It there last man standing.
NEUT22|So there's something positive now.
NEUT23|Well, back to our conversation about checks.
NEUT24|I mean is that where these things are are being spent with this image?
NEUT25|The stock market?
NEUT26|Yeah, I just hope that maybe I saw them buying QQQ's.
NEUT27|That's good yeah, but the damn thing David, GameStop and Tesla, we haven't talked about those two.
NEUT28|Member GameStop said they might do an at the money offering.
NEUT29|They might do an actual offering, all freezer.
NEUT30|Obviously, the kiss of death, we look at Quantum Scape MP, which is a company that I liked.
NEUT31|It didn't.
NEUT32|The link look outcome and then Viacom.
BEAR33|There are no shorts left if they took him out.
NEUT34|It was.
NEUT35|The GameStop massacre was almost like the Valentine's Day massacre.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
