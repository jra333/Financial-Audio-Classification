NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint I do own Amazon from the long side in my retirement accounts.
NEUT5|So just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
NEUT6|So overall want to get some things updated here as now that the dust has settled, there's a whole new week in the books of good solid pattern has formed and by no means is this pattern some sort of great discover on my part.
NEUT7|I'm not trying to come across like that at all.
NEUT8|I assure you, a lot of people are watching this pattern are going to be wondering the same things and I bring that up because when lots of people are watching the same pattern, wondering the same things called his cellphone prophecy called whatever you want, it can definitely produce some very dynamic movements in the area here that a lot of people watching from the resistance side of things is going to be.
NEUT9|That resistance red line right there?
NEUT10|So that's the top portion of the pattern.
NEUT11|And the bottom portion of the pattern is going to be this portion right there.
NEUT12|Actually, let me change that to green to represent the support portion of it, but overall we're going to have a special triangle wedge, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT13|The the point here being is not the name of the pattern, but the psychology behind the psychology behind it is.
BULL14|The Bears are making progress.
NEUT15|And they're making progress because the price is touchingly put in lower highs, but on the same time the Bulls are also making progress by you can see right there that red line moving in the upward direction, and so who ultimately is going to win out?
NEUT16|Well, you gotta look at the trend of things.
BEAR17|And as right now a very very bullish uptrend.
NEUT18|So just because it's in a bullish uptrend doesn't mean that for sure guaranteed you know the price is going to break out to the upside.
NEUT19|But my point here is that you know if you're going for somebody to choose, then you would want to go with the direction of the trend, right?
NEUT20|The trend is your friend, so that's going to be an area that a lot of people are watching.
NEUT21|Anwen a lot of people are watching it.
NEUT22|Not a guarantee but a logical thoughts have.
BEAR23|But if the price were to get up there and breakthrough that level, that could very well create quite a bit of upside buying pressure.
NEUT24|Just because right?
NEUT25|Just cell phone process.
NEUT26|Hey look, it broke out of that pattern.
NEUT27|I'm going to buy so we'll see what happens with it.
NEUT28|But overall that's going to be the main pattern that a lot of people are watching that symmetrical triangle, so we'll see how the price plays out next week.

BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird.
NEUT34|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT35|But in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
