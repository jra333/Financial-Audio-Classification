NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, Apple continues its very impressive movement to the upside.
NEUT5|So certainly some updates here need to be made first.
NEUT6|Going to little house cleaning here.
NEUT7|Just get rid of that line down there.
NEUT8|Sure, that level pertains just not relevant right now.
NEUT9|And from a presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT10|'cause there's lines are where you look, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible, But the first update that need to be done come about based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed above you want to see them act as support and that's what's going on here with now.
NEUT11|A dollar or dollar to excuse me 121 so 121.
NEUT12|Now being that main level.
NEUT13|We're an I should call the ideal level mean.
BEAR14|It's not like if the price drops below that level, then all of a sudden the entire charts destroyed.
BULL15|I'm not saying that at all, but yeah, preferably speaking, if the price could stay up above that area, that would definitely be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT16|Looking at everything from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT17|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT18|The 50.
NEUT19|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT20|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT21|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT22|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT23|Higher must visualize that.
NEUT24|That is what has been represented.
NEUT25|Again, yeah, staying above 121 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100%.
NEUT26|On the chart, as far as areas of resistance are concerned deathly, nothing fancy or complicated here, just a question of where the party momentum finally stopped today and that was right up there at 123 fifty so 123.
NEUT27|Fifty will be that initial roadblock.
NEUT28|They're moving forward, but All in all, any angle you look at it, great movement today, great volume.
NEUT29|Now the question just remains the same.
BULL30|Can the price continue to build upon this momentum?
NEUT31|Moving forward?
NEUT32|Let's see what happens.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT35|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR39|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT45|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT46|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.

NEUT48|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
