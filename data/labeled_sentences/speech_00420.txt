BEAR0|"""So Tesla stocks are free falling again with lows at about $600 a share, and compared to the highs at $880."
BEAR1|This seems like a complete crash.
BEAR2|In fact, we are currently experiencing the biggest drop in the entire history of Tesla, and if you're wondering what the F is happening, you're definitely not the only one.
NEUT3|In today's video, we're going to break down exactly what made the stock go down that much, and whether this new dip is still a potential buy opportunity.
NEUT4|And we talked about this before considering the previous growth.
BULL5|We're looking at some massive potential gains here.

NEUT9|But without further ado, let's get started.
NEUT10|So, as you probably already know, Tesla is a very complicated one.
BEAR11|After being last year's darling, with the stock rallying an incredible 743%, this big gain left the stock vulnerable to a pullback.
BEAR12|Of course, and a temporary shutdown of its model three production line due to a lack of parts was enough excuse to start the selling, delivering fourth quarter results that missed earnings estimates just made the situation worse.
BULL13|Nevertheless, Tesla sees a 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries, with 2021 expected to be even faster than that pace.
NEUT14|But before we can answer the question of whether now is a good opportunity to buy the stock, despite the fact that it's still going down, we quickly have to breakdown what actually happened last year.
NEUT15|An what to expect.
BULL16|So Tesla has undertaken a massive expansion of manufacturing.
BULL17|Musk wants to eventually build 20 million electric vehicles a year over the next decade.
BULL18|That's more than double the current production of other automaking Giants, which means that Tesla is now officially on a mission to rapidly expand its manufacturing capabilities.
BULL19|The company also took a big step with its third manufacturing plant, where construction is now underway near Berlin.
NEUT20|That plant is expected to be completed in March 2021, where it will produce the model white.
NEUT21|Then in July, must confirm that its fourth manufacturing plant would be built near Austin, TX.
NEUT22|That factory will be Tesla's largest built on a 2000 acre chunk of land that will produce the cyber truck.
NEUT23|And it's big rig truck gold semi as well as the Model Y and Model 3.
NEUT24|But please do not forget that as soon as Tesla starts pumping out cars in Germany it will go head to head in electric vehicles with three established German names, Volkswagen Group, BMW and the Mercedes-Benz Division of Daimler.
NEUT25|It will be a tough battle is all three car companies have reputations for quality cars?
NEUT26|Other serious competitors include Ford Motor, Mustang and much more.
NEUT27|Alright, so let's come back to the question of this video.
NEUT28|What will the future of Tesla look like and is now a good time to buy?
BULL29|Well in our opinion, Tesla is a fantastic deal right now after pushing up almost 800% last year.
NEUT30|This could be a perfect opportunity to buy and catch the pull back and wait for the next massive push.
BULL31|And if you take a quick look at the chart we currently are at a major support level, ready to get rejected and go up again.
BEAR32|Nevertheless, Tesla stock has long been extended from its bizone after breaking out of a Cup with handle with a buy point of 400.
NEUT33|66 on November 18th.
NEUT34|So please trade with caution and watch your position size alright with that being it for today's video.
