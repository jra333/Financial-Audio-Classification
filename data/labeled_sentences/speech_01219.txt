NEUT0|"""Welcome to our chart top tutorial."
NEUT1|This is an update to Yahoo.
NEUT2|We had a corrected point occurring on 18th of the seven 2014 and that's where we wrote it on your eye chart.
NEUT3|Top app.
NEUT4|On from date on the eighth of the seven 2014, but at first wave.
NEUT5|But it's second wave got it.
NEUT6|Third wave got out.
NEUT7|4th wave.
NEUT8|4-5 from ammonia count, and then we're on our 4th wave.
NEUT9|We write a two date on I chart top app.
NEUT10|And will calculate a target price for us, which the target price for a W 5 is $36.95 and as you said, you can see it closed for a W5 it closed at $36.90, so it's pretty good prediction.
NEUT11|Now with the target price it was $36.95.
NEUT12|It's only out by $0.05 and you know, we've had this prediction.
NEUT13|If you look back now, we probably predict account number, the date it was.
NEUT14|I think it was.
NEUT15|We predicted it on the on the 24th or the 25th or whatever or 23rd.
NEUT16|How high it was actually going to go and he hit our target price.
BEAR17|You can see it's fairly accurate and yeah, and we had a drop coming through now.
NEUT18|Will see what happens if it goes up any further.
NEUT19|It might be another little minute.
NEUT20|Count the Curry.
NEUT21|We'll find out and we will keep you up to date with the update to Yahoo.
