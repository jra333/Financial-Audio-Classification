NEUT0|"""I was curious what Caterpillar had to say."
BEAR1|They're stuck in the midst of a three year bear market for commodities, and up until 18 months ago, oil and energy was the last holdout for their their machinery and everything, and that's just not, you know, it hasn't panned out either, so they actually reported this morning and the earnings were actually pretty good.
BEAR2|They beat a little bit, but I mean obviously revenues and everything around revenues came in 11 billion, down from 14.2 billion in Q4 2014.
BEAR3|They reported a loss of $0.15 per share, but.
NEUT4|They would have reported profits get profits of $0.74 had they not taken like a $900 million hit from restructuring costs so.
NEUT5|I mean, you investors really should keep that into account 'cause any large organization like that.
NEUT6|They're going to have restructuring stuff all the time, like you shouldn't really take any credence at $0.74 per share number.
NEUT7|But anyway, management talked exclusively about how tough it is out there, and they just went on and on about how they're cutting costs.
NEUT8|That's literally like half their half their call have to press release everything.
BEAR9|Yeah, slumber J laid off a lot of people with categories been laying off people for a couple of years and it's getting hairy.
NEUT10|Yeah, of course.
NEUT11|I was really interested what they thought about their 2016 outlook.
NEUT12|They do not anticipate.
NEUT13|Any bounce back in any?
NEUT14|I mean, they're obviously not just an oil machinery.
NEUT15|They do cover all the mining machinery and everything, and they're not expecting improving demand picture at all for their equipment.
BULL16|They call for sales and revenues around 42 billion and gap earnings per share.
BULL17|I was happy to see this of 350 per share, so not the worst now.
NEUT18|But I mean what was it?
NEUT19|Was it this year?
NEUT20|I think total year was somewhere in foreign change, so born change.
NEUT21|So it's not the worst in the world so.
NEUT22|I obviously caterpillars a cyclical business just like everything else here, and we'll probably see a little bit of a lag on pick up on equipment similar to like we were talking about with drilling activity where they're probably not going to be buying any new equipment until prices going up.
NEUT23|Got Sean holders back first pay, pay the debt and stuff like that, but at today's prices, if we're looking at.
NEUT24|A long term investor.
NEUT25|Is there value kind of baked into shares nowadays or do you think maybe, perhaps maybe hold on that's when I went into school or at the bottom of the cycle.
BEAR26|Things are getting really bad.
NEUT27|Maybe it's by now there are trading at 59 bucks and change this morning.
BULL28|It's up like 1 1/2% on earnings.
BEAR29|It's down from I think 110 a year ago or something.
NEUT30|It's 52 week highs over well over 100 but you heard me say the guidance for 2016 which is 350 here.
NEUT31|So they're trading at 16 times forward earnings.
NEUT32|I think that is more than fair.
BULL33|"Given we don't know when things are going to rebound, we don't know when earnings are going to rebound on the market multiples 19 or 20 right now, so I think it's fairly valued."""
