NEUT0|"""We know that the Fed is not inclined to do anything on overnight rates until probably the first quarter of 2022, almost by their own admission."
NEUT1|We also know the threshold for them to decide that inflation is a threat is like a higher bar than maybe it's ever been in history there, like talking about income inequality, inequality as part of that discussion.
NEUT2|So if we know that and we continue to see that 10 year rise, just pull up a chart of Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT3|This is important.
BULL4|This stock is breaking a multi top peak that dates back to early 2018 break.
NEUT5|It's not out, almost breakout, it's a breakout in progress.
NEUT6|Think about companies sitting with massive war chest in cash with insurance subsidiaries that have more money coming in than they know what to do with and no way to earn money in a risk freeway that all of a sudden.
NEUT7|Now they are going to be earning money.
NEUT8|So I want to look at asset managers, insurers, broker dealers.
NEUT9|An Berkshire Hathaway could be the next Mega Cap breakout.
NEUT10|This stock has done nothing in a very long time, both in absolute terms and relative to the market.
BEAR11|Massive market cap.
BEAR12|Huge implications if this thing gets on its horse for the rest of the quote.
NEUT13|"Unquote value, cyclical trades."""
