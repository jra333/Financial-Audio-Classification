NEUT0|"""With the first presidential debate just a day away, we thought it was time to play a little political trivia."
NEUT1|So how is President Trump connected to electric car makers?
NEUT2|Tesla and Nikola?
NEUT3|Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's editor in Chief Andy Serwer, who has the answer to that.
NEUT4|Hey Andy, good morning I saw your story on our website about this over the weekend.
NEUT5|So connect the dots for audience.
NEUT6|What do all three have in common?
NEUT7|Well, first of all, let's start off Alexis specifically with Tesla and Donald Trump.
NEUT8|And go back to the 1940s.
NEUT9|The invent the inventor Nikola Tesla died in 1943.
NEUT10|The FBI was called in to vet his inventions to make sure there was nothing dangerous there that could fall into enemy hands.
NEUT11|See electrical engineering professor of various teams.
NEUT12|One named John Trump.
NEUT13|Now it turns out that that John Trump is in fact the uncle of the President of the United States.
NEUT14|So an interesting thing there.
NEUT15|And by the way, he found out the Tesla's inventions, which included a purported death Ray, were not necessarily dangerous to society.
NEUT16|But then, if you flash forward to today, you've got Tesla, the automaker named after this inventor Nikola Tesla.
NEUT17|And in a way, Elon Musk is the intellectual descendant of Nikola Tesla, Futurista polymath and someone with a million inventions at his in his mind who sometimes emulates the President Alexis with Twitter but sometimes sparrs with him about, say, emissions standards and Chinese tariffs.
NEUT18|So very interesting connection there, and there's more of course too.
NEUT19|And he saw was reading your story over the weekend and I and I left with a sense.
NEUT20|You know what Tesla is?
NEUT21|The real deal, Nikola not proven that it could bring hydrogen to market.
NEUT22|But Tesla two years ago?
NEUT23|Who would have thought we would be in this position right now?
NEUT24|That test would have this type of market cap that would be pushing out cars that like it is.
NEUT25|Yeah, over $300 billion in market cap more than GM, Ford and Toyota combined with billions more to spare.
NEUT26|And it's interesting again.
NEUT27|Getting back to these connections Nikola Tesla.
NEUT28|Of course.
BEAR29|Tesla named after his last name, Nicola named after his first name and you talk about Nicola and the problems are having a lot of it has to do with the credibility of the founder and former CEO Trevor Milton, who stepped down last Sunday of week this.
NEUT30|From yesterday before yesterday and a lot of it has to do with statements that he made Brian right, and in other words, we promise to do this.
NEUT31|We're going to do this now.
NEUT32|Musk is done the same things, but he's delivered not always and critics point out too well.
NEUT33|You didn't do this.
NEUT34|You didn't do that.
NEUT35|On the other hand, there are a million Teslas on the road today, and there's zero Nikola trucks.
NEUT36|Not saying that Nikola will never do it, but they have a way.
NEUT37|A ways to go before they have that credibility.
NEUT38|And then if you look at promises and making claims.
NEUT39|Again, doesn't that tie back to the president because the president's done an awful lot of that too?
NEUT40|Some people say it's just hyperbole.
NEUT41|Some people say he goes too far, so that's sort of the world that we're living in right now, and it's sort of.
NEUT42|It's interesting to see the connection there as well.
NEUT43|Alright, interesting stuff there, Andy.
