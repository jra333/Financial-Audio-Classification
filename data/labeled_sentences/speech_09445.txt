BULL0|"""So today Bitcoin broke the $21,000 threshold."
NEUT1|But where is it going?
NEUT2|What does this mean for your Holdings?
NEUT3|And how does Guggenheim and their Chief investment officer value Bitcoin at $400,000?
NEUT4|Let's find out.
NEUT5|So there's a couple of things that are really driving it.
NEUT6|Besides the macro tailwinds, which we just all talked about, but you have a lot of institutional adoption so you've had over the last week or so you've had mass mutual say that they're going to be buying into Bitcoin.
NEUT7|You've had corporate Treasurys with MicroStrategy and Square.
NEUT8|Buying into Bitcoin so you kind of have these large strong handed buyers coming in.
NEUT9|And let's remember there's only 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist.
NEUT10|There's 18.5 million Bitcoin currently in circulation.
BEAR11|The extra 3.5 million Bitcoin are going to be created over the next 100 years, so the supply is severely constrained in an environment just like we talked about with the Fed.
NEUT12|They're just going to continue to print money.
NEUT13|It doesn't matter what the economy does.
NEUT14|They're just going to continue to print money, and so investors are saying, well, I can buy gold, which is the traditional one.
NEUT15|Or I can buy Bitcoin, which is digital gold with a venture capital tech ticker.
NEUT16|Yeah, and some CEOs are saying I'm going to buy Bitcoin instead of having cash on the balance sheet, which is the case in MicroStrategy and their cash reserves.
NEUT17|When we spoke with Michael Saylor, you might ask out there be asking, what about the technicals on this breakout?
NEUT18|Will Carter Braxton worth the cornerstone macro actually sent this charter long?
NEUT19|And this is what he wrote he wrote.
NEUT20|This move is quote unquote, a proper breakout, an old-fashioned textbook breakout.
NEUT21|Scott Guggenheim has reserved the right to invest up to 10% of its macro fund in Bitcoin.
NEUT22|Have you guys started buying yet?
NEUT23|We made the decision to start allocating toward Bitcoin when Bitcoin was a 10,000.
BULL24|Amazing, you know over a very short period of time, how big of a run up we've had.
NEUT25|But having said that, our our fundamental work shows that Bitcoin should be worth about $400,000, so we're going to even if we had the ability to do so today, we're going to monitor the market and.
NEUT26|See how trading goes, well, evaluation, but ultimately what about you get from where we are now out to 400,000?
NEUT27|Is it just based on scarcity?
NEUT28|Yeah, right on it said based on the scarcity, an relative valuations such as things like gold as a percentage of GDP.
NEUT29|So you know their Bitcoin is actually has a lot of the attributes of gold and at the same time has an unusual value in terms of transactions.
NEUT30|So why is this valuation by Guggenheim so important?
NEUT31|It's important because these are the professionals, the experts, the individuals paid millions of dollars to calculate and make sense of financial assets and global investments.
NEUT32|This is what they call the smart money.
BULL33|But most importantly, this is important because at this time we're still early, meaning that if you currently own Bitcoin or just now getting into this space, you're still in a great position.
