NEUT0|"""So hi guys tonight May 1 2020 I will give my own personal technical analysis of Amazon shares so currently it's trading and will close in about 5 hours 22 minutes so."
NEUT1|Anyway, as a recap, my last video was actually that was April 28 and I'm expecting it to.
NEUT2|Treat this this support level because the RSI is going down during that time.
NEUT3|And yeah.
NEUT4|It's actually it.
BEAR5|Dating went to protest the support level and now currently trading at still near support level because of the disappointed remains which came as a surprise.
NEUT6|Which is.
BEAR7|Lower than expected by about.
NEUT8|19.46% so.
NEUT9|So with that.
NEUT10|We could possibly yes.
NEUT11|See at at most.
NEUT12|A possible keno.
BEAR13|Correction or pullback at most at around 2000 and.
BULL14|Anything below that it's actually already a good buy for me and accumulate Amazon shares.
NEUT15|So this is the support I'm actually looking at the second support.
NEUT16|This is the second support I'm looking at because the here.
NEUT17|If not even retest, it is close to support, but you know it's not even there.
NEUT18|Trying to break it.
BULL19|So this one is still our strong support level.
NEUT20|If it breaks then this is our possible next support.
NEUT21|So.
NEUT22|Yeah, well.
NEUT23|As to the earnings actually 20%, it's not that much.
NEUT24|Nothing much big so.
BULL25|Long term and still or for this quarter and still looking at bonds and reach an all time high.
NEUT26|Actually, I'm expecting at least 3000 for this quarter.
NEUT27|So yeah, let's so far now since the earnings disappoint investors, let them.
NEUT28|Let them you know cash in their money.
NEUT29|And their profit and.
NEUT30|Will take the profit next.
NEUT31|So yeah, there you go.
NEUT32|Games if you have some questions, comments and feedback please feel free to reach me out.
BULL33|"Thanks guys."""
