BEAR0|"""With the end of March, we're going to see a very big increase, I believe, so we've been seeing this huge decrease ever since we saw our all time high here, March 11th, 3:00 PM."
BEAR1|We saw that $0.50 range and we saw an 11% decrease since then as I'm speaking.
BEAR2|And if you go back to the one week we're seeing it decrease.
BEAR3|We're not seeing much of a stabilization here.
BEAR4|We saw a little bit and then we saw an increase and we saw stabilized right back down to that .4 area.
BEAR5|If we continue to see it decrease, there could be problems.
NEUT6|For Polygon.
NEUT7|I see Polygon.
NEUT8|Being a long term quote coin, but if you're trying to make you know quick profits, I see Polygon having some issues.
NEUT9|If it gets below you know that let's say .3 range.
BULL10|I think that will be a dip and you can buy that dip for some solid gains.
NEUT11|Most likely.
NEUT12|Remember guys, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT13|I will never be a finance financial advisor and I will never give you guys financial advice.
NEUT14|So do your own research on these coins.
NEUT15|Obviously there's a lot more to it than I can cover in.
NEUT16|You know my 6 to 7 to 8 minute videos, so make sure you take a look yourself.
NEUT17|I just give you guys my price prediction.
NEUT18|Based on the information that I know and the information that I've received and based on my experiences in the last few years looking at cryptocurrencies.
NEUT19|So if we look at the market cap in the last, we have that 1.9 billion.
NEUT20|Like we said earlier.
NEUT21|And because of that, I think by the end of March there will be a $0.50 Polygon.
NEUT22|I think it won't go much higher in that I want to be realistic.
BULL23|We saw that huge increase all the way up to $0.50 previously.
BULL24|I think we'll have a new all time high.
BULL25|I think it'll reach about $0.52 in and hoping it will stabilize about $0.50 by the end of March.
BULL26|Polygon, though I think by the end of April will definitely increase much more, I think.
NEUT27|Depending on how well they do with their projects and their updates, and if they have any big news or anything, I think Polygon could end up being a 60 to 75 cent token just halfway through April.
NEUT28|By the end of April it has a chance at becoming a dollar coin, and that's and that's very realistic with Polygon.
NEUT29|If they continue.
BULL30|If they can continue to solve these problems, Polygon will definitely become a dollar coin or higher I think by the end of the year we see Polygon reaching a $2.00 mark and that's going to be about where it tops off.
BULL31|I think it could go higher, potentially.
NEUT32|Obviously that depends a lot on the market cap in the circulating supply, but Polygon has the potential to go above $2.00 by the end of 21, and that's going to be my price prediction for Polygon if you guys have any information that you know I missed out on, or you have any price predictions that you think that I have not done a great job on, let me know in the comments.
NEUT33|Let me know if you guys think there's going to be.
NEUT34|You know, different price by the end of 2021 I want to hear why you think it though and not just you know your thoughts on it.
NEUT35|I will also try to be realistic on my price predictions.
NEUT36|So if you guys are, you know saying $510 by the end of 21.
NEUT37|I'm not saying it's not possible, I'm saying that I'm trying to be as realistic as possible and based on their previous updates and projects and how the market is continuing to increase at a slower rate or not a slower rate, but a faster rate.
NEUT38|I see two dollars, $2.15 in that area, definitely being possibility, and I want to see what you guys have and what kind of thoughts you guys think on Polygon itself.
BULL39|"I think this coin is definitely a long term potential."""
