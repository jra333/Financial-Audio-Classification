NEUT0|"""Chris, make your way over there."
NEUT1|I think.
NEUT2|I think when we look at these pictures, what we need to remember is a lot of these stocks encountered some pretty serious bear markets in 2018.
BULL3|Now we look at Facebook after hours up 8%.
BULL4|Certainly a good response.
NEUT5|Gotta back above that 190 level, which is certainly important, but I want to just take a step back and look at the longer term chart here.
NEUT6|And let's just remember Facebook in 2012 after the IPO had a 60% drawdown, the next largest drawdown.
NEUT7|Was actually last year.
BEAR8|Stock was down 45 but it was actually down 20.
BEAR9|It was down 20 and 45 last year that bear Market in this stock is over.
BULL10|Getting back above that 190 level we think was key.
NEUT11|It's done it.
NEUT12|You have to imagine this at least it's going to run at those old highs near 220 and then when you look at the other big name that certainly reported today.
NEUT13|One of the biggest stocks out there.
BULL14|Another positive response for Microsoft here up about 3% and it's another name when we look at the longer term story.
NEUT15|This has been a One Direction stock over the better.
NEUT16|Part of the last five or six years first broke out in 2013.
NEUT17|It hasn't looked back.
BEAR18|It's had two cyclical drawdowns along the way.
NEUT19|You had one in 2015, 2016.
BEAR20|It was down 20% over that.
BEAR21|It recovered this loss in 43 days.
BEAR22|It made new highs this decline last year.
BEAR23|Also down about 20%.
BEAR24|It's now recovered this loss in about 55 trading days.
BULL25|So this quick response to these deep oversold conditions last year.
NEUT26|Is nothing new, it's how the stock behaved last year.
NEUT27|We think you want to stay long here.
NEUT28|I think.
NEUT29|Ultimately, if we're looking for kind of a near term target, you can point to.
NEUT30|You know, maybe even 175 on Microsoft and move through the course of the year.
BULL31|But we have to like the response to both these companies with their earnings this year.
BULL32|Alright, Chris, thank you.
NEUT33|By the way, we do have Teslas results, they are out.
NEUT34|Phil is coming through this letter.
NEUT35|The shareholder letter will bring you the details as we have it in time.
NEUT36|Pete, let's talk Microsoft.
NEUT37|And now you're in this name.
NEUT38|This is one that Chris likes.
BULL39|Yep, I like it too.
BULL40|I still think there's plenty of upside.
NEUT41|I think it was last week or two weeks ago we were talking about potentially 140 in the cards by the end of the year.
NEUT42|I'm not talking about something in the very near term, although based on what we're seeing in the earnings, look at the growth in revenue, look at the growth that you've gotten as you look at the growth that you've gotten gaming.
BULL43|I mean, this is a company that just continues to pump out exactly what the market needs, especially given the run it at Microsoft has been on this almost straight up move.
BULL44|It feels like over the last couple of months and it's been very, very impressive.
NEUT45|One of the leaders old school tech as we call it.
NEUT46|But I love this name.
NEUT47|I still think when you look at how much cash they've got minimal debt.
NEUT48|They've made some acquisitions.
BEAR49|But when you look at all of that, this is a company that is doing everything right and they're playing into the market and they are slowly eating away at some of that market share from a WS.
BULL50|"There's also a decent read integers enterprise, and if people want to look for clues on the economy, the fact that you know they're continuing to see the operating leverage in this core business be talked about as are exciting."""
