NEUT0|"""We're going to watch chips because this Journal piece this morning on Samsung considering an investment much as $17 billion to make a chip factory in either Arizona, Texas and New York."
BULL1|We are, so that is just fantastic.
NEUT2|A lot of the this is one that President Biden really has to get involved in because he can make a difference.
NEUT3|I say that because these companies are doing it, they don't have to put it here.
NEUT4|We're a high cost country, but it's very important that they do that because we're protecting their country.
NEUT5|And they sense that.
NEUT6|So I am very involved with looking at what they're going to do because we need much more Lambert surge supplied material.
NEUT7|Those are all the semiconductor capital equipment companies we need.
NEUT8|All of them at work in order to be able to meet this incredible chip shortage.
NEUT9|By the way, just want to revert to GME for second.
NEUT10|You're wondering what's happened there?
NEUT11|The people who are short the 60 calls are being bought in for being covered there, and they are not the lot of times there along the 40 calls and short, the 60 calls don't be too technical here.
NEUT12|But the 40 calls are not being sold at the same price, so it's entirely possible that people are short this and they didn't realize they would be shorted, and that's what the frantic covering is, David.
NEUT13|You've also got covering by some of these hedge funds.
BEAR14|Yeah, oh, I didn't know I was gonna say Secondly or in the belief that it would crack at some point.
NEUT15|I need to find that the people they were up against are unified in their opposition.
NEUT16|If they're unifying to buy, but if their unified just by free speech and love of the stock, right?
NEUT17|You can't.
NEUT18|Government does not have a case.
NEUT19|But I mean if you are running a hedge fund and you have a large short position in this name, you gotta cut, you can't.
NEUT20|It's you can't risk take that kind of risk.
NEUT21|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT22|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
