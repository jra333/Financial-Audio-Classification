BEAR0|"""With covid cases exploding right now, Airbnb is going to have real ugly fourth quarter in that week."
NEUT1|This could very well extending the first quarter of next year.
NEUT2|But think about this by the time April rolls around, millions of people should be vaccinated member.
BULL3|I'm calling it the vaccine glut and I have to believe will see recovery in the travel stocks in a rapid fashion.
BULL4|Plus, once we get to March, everybody's going to be up against some incredibly easy comparisons.
BULL5|They set sets the company up for some monster year over year growth.
BULL6|In other words, this business will look great in 2021, specially when you layer in all the cost cuts they put through.
NEUT7|On top of that, Airbnbs, a last man standing situation.
NEUT8|Sadly, a bunch of smaller bed and breakfasts.
BEAR9|Are going under which means less competition, but the next few months could be pretty rough, especially if IPO investors freak out when they see Airbnb first.
NEUT10|Quarter advocate, they shouldn't.
NEUT11|They should know that they should be listening.
NEUT12|Meanwhile they've got some real competition, then this VRBO at Expedia's VAC Vacation Rental subsidiary and there are at least a half dozen smaller players in the same space.
NEUT13|Still, I think Air BNB I'm telling you I think I'd buy it.
NEUT14|Yes, right price but I would buy it.
NEUT15|This toxic to complete 56 and 60.
BULL16|Got a feral bit closer to the higher end of the range or even above it at the high end.
BULL17|This company would have a $42 billion market cap, not down with 17 where it was.
NEUT18|But you know, listen this big company and it's a good one.
NEUT19|At 60 Air BNB trading a little less than 10 times next year.
NEUT20|Sales at least according to estimates from an Alpha Kalanick equities.
NEUT21|If the stock gets up to 80, that's 113 times sales that's too expensive for me.
NEUT22|That's more than twice as expensive.
NEUT23|Something like Lyft or Uber.
NEUT24|So where do I come down?
BULL25|The bottom line is that I want you to own Air BNB because it's set to have a terrific year.
NEUT26|Starting next March, that means you've got a few months to make move.
NEUT27|No rush.
NEUT28|If you can get the stock for $68 or less this week, I back up the truck.
NEUT29|If you can get it for less than 85, I'm granting you a small position.
NEUT30|Any higher though, and I would have to say you gotta keep your bag on your shoulder and wait for better pitch.
