NEUT0|"""Just want to jump in with some Amazon numbers here guys, we're going to go into these in more detail, but just a couple of key headline numbers."
NEUT1|Revenue 89 billion just under that 88.9 forecast was for 81.4 billion.
BULL2|Of course, that was already an elevated forecast in terms of the segment sales.
NEUT3|North American revenue is forecast to come in at 50.4 billion.
NEUT4|That's coming at 55 billion guys.
NEUT5|I'm going to dig into this a bit more as just crossing as you can see, but those headline numbers of sales.
BULL6|Overall, in sales in America, a strong beat 4% higher in after hours.
BULL7|Yeah, and seeing a big boost there, obviously the net sales increase of 40%.
BULL8|It's particularly stunning here.
BULL9|I heard a wow Stephanie link.
BULL10|It looks like getting some other numbers, operating cash flow increased 42%.
BEAR11|I mean just giant numbers were going through and look at a WS 'cause somewhere but I'm worried about that bottom line as well is just not the top line.
NEUT12|So bottom line, operating income 5.8 billion second quarter, last year's 3 billion.
NEUT13|The forecast was for 1.2 people.
NEUT14|Expecting quite a lot of costs that come out because of covid.
BULL15|To hit the bottom line, but the top lines beaten comfortably, the bottom line beating as well, so where Stephanie is Sarah was suggesting this was high expectations.
NEUT16|They've been it.
NEUT17|They crushed it.
NEUT18|They absolutely crushed it.
NEUT19|I mean on the top line the only thing is I think we were expecting them to crush it, especially in North America, right?
NEUT20|So let's see what a WS is, but I don't think I could poke a hole in this just yet.
NEUT21|I mean, this looks great across the board for now, so let's see what as the numbers come out looking for 11 billion on a WS.
NEUT22|So let's see what that number is.
NEUT23|10.8 billion Stephanie on a WS sales.
NEUT24|As you said, the forecast was 11.02.
BEAR25|So fractionally behind the expectation there in terms of the other lines.
NEUT26|Where the beat comes through on revenue.
NEUT27|As we said, the net sales in America forecast 55 came in at 55 billion.
NEUT28|The forecast was 50 billion.
NEUT29|International revenue came in at 22.7 billion and the forecast was for 19.7 billion.
NEUT30|"So those two lines where the beats come through on the revenue, a WS 100,000,000 or so behind expectations at 10.8 billion."""
