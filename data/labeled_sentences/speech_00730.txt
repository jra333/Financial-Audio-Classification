NEUT0|"""Well today's the day Tesla is finally in the S&P 500."
NEUT1|Hi, my name is Christian.
NEUT2|Thank you for tuning into this channel.
NEUT3|Let's talk more about Tesla.
NEUT4|So now that Tesla is in the S&P, it now accounts for 1.6% of the entire S&P 500.
NEUT5|That's alot.
NEUT6|Not the most though.
NEUT7|Apple takes the most with around 6:00 or 7% if you follow the stock, even slightly.
NEUT8|Hopefully you're aware of what the heck happened on Friday afternoon like 1/2 hour before clothes drop down to like 6.
NEUT9|30 when all the way up to like 690 and then I think it finished around like 677.
NEUT10|That's pretty volatile, but that's strictly because big ETF's and index funds had to buy, you know, X amount of shares now that it's in SMB 500.
BEAR11|It's a long, complicated story that doesn't really involve you, but it was a volatile end of the session man.
NEUT12|Remember when Tesla couldn't turn a profitable quarter and now they've done 5 profitable quarters in a row?
NEUT13|Look at how far we've come started from the bottom.
NEUT14|Now we're here, so here are some things to keep in mind about Tesla, specifically as 2020 wraps up, and now that it's in the S&P 500, statistically and historically, after companies get added into the S&P 500, they tend to just kind of level out for a little bit.
NEUT15|They tend to chill for a couple reasons.
NEUT16|One is the fact that for the most part, whenever a company gets announced that it's going to be added into the S&P 500, it's going to run.
NEUT17|Which is exactly what Tesla did.
NEUT18|Granted test letters runs for no reason apparently, but that's exactly what Tesla did back since what like mid November Ish when it was announced that it was going into the SMP.
NEUT19|So typically that is going to happen.
NEUT20|I'm not saying that is going to happen with Tesla, but I'm just saying this.
NEUT21|Don't be surprised if it doesn't do anything for a couple of weeks because it's just kind of tired.
NEUT22|You relatively speaking at the same sense because it's being added at this time of year.
NEUT23|I also.
BEAR24|I personally believe it's probably not going to do much until the new year.
NEUT25|Here's why.
NEUT26|Today is Monday, December 21st.
NEUT27|We have a shortened trading week this week with Friday being Christmas with no trading and Christmas Eve being on Thursday and I would like to presume we have 1/2 day of trading, which means 3 1/2 days.
NEUT28|Same thing for next week with New Year's Eve and new.
NEUT29|Yeah, New Year's.
NEUT30|So they're not full weeks.
BEAR31|This is typically like the end of the year, so I know that a lot of firms you know, the people that work there, they're taking time off.
BEAR32|They're not really going on vacation, but you know they're just not working, so I think there's this less people in the office, which could potentially mean less buying power, so don't be shocked if Tesla doesn't really do much these next two weeks until the new year.
NEUT33|I also wouldn't be surprised if in the next two weeks it's sort of sells off a little bit, not a major sell off, but I'm just saying.
BULL34|It's been up 700% since the beginning of the year.
NEUT35|I would have to imagine people are taking profits at some point, not necessarily eliminating their entire position, but you know, they're locking in profits because especially some of the bigger firms they sort of have to do that to meet quotas and all of that fun stuff.
NEUT36|So with all that being said, are you buying Tesla heading into the new year, or are you going to wait for it to dip a little bit?
NEUT37|If it does in these next couple weeks, let me know in the comments below.
NEUT38|Thank you for watching.
