BEAR0|"""We're seeing these losses deep in in after hours trading and I'm wondering what is it that investors are really picking up on here."
BEAR1|Yeah, fiscal Q2 is OK, but three Q guidance was a little shy of consensus.
NEUT2|The question is as we go into the call, will get a better sense of was this guidance lower than consensus Ann is?
NEUT3|Is it then being conservative because the new architecture is going to be launched and ahead of a new architecture being launched?
NEUT4|Usually the old architecture chip sales weekend, right?
NEUT5|So it's standard air pocket before the iPhone 10 comes out the iPhone 9, yes?
BEAR6|Sales are are lower, so is it that kind of a situation option A or option B?
NEUT7|Is there more afoot with respect to crypto gaming sort of?
NEUT8|The interplay that we've talked about going into the quarter and in terms of the new chip architecture talking about the Turing graphics processor, right?
NEUT9|What is this used for?
NEUT10|I mean, we talked about how NVIDIA is represented across different parts of technology, whether it's gaming, whether it's AI, whether it's cloud, whether it's crypto, is it used for?
NEUT11|All those different segments, absolutely.
NEUT12|So if you look at the architecture changes, some of the key technology in the GPU's that they produce that are then repurposed for all of these different applications.
NEUT13|These are fundamental changes, processing of data and images faster, differing and resolution at a higher rate.
BULL14|Potentially being able to show light in a clearer way.
NEUT15|The way it's meant to be shown so that images can be shown more accurately as in real life an if you do that really well.
BULL16|And you're able to process those images faster.
BULL17|It makes those chips more attractive to game players.
NEUT18|People who develop content for movies, etc.
NEUT19|An.
NEUT20|Also, there's some of the same technology can be some of the core tenets of that technology can be used in their data center chips as well, again from a processing speed perspective.
NEUT21|I remember you mentioned crypto like where all those stories six months ago about how people couldn't find Invidia chips 'cause Ethereum miners were buying them all.
NEUT22|That story must be kind of.
NEUT23|Over a bit with the price right?
NEUT24|So the question is, we don't know how much of that was baked into the gaming into the gaming chip revenue.
NEUT25|They have separated out into a new product and created a new crypto SKU.
NEUT26|New product so that crypto miners can use this product versus the gaming product.
NEUT27|On the other hand, when a crypto miner wants to get a GPU, he doesn't care what GPU he gets, so you know there's a.
NEUT28|There's a little bit of that potentially is going on and on.
NEUT29|What's the one question you want answered on the call?
NEUT30|I really want to get a sense of the Turing based jump that we're going to see in revenues in a GPU perspective, and I want to really have a baseline understanding of what crypto is.
NEUT31|I want to see the worst case impact of crypto.
NEUT32|"I want to take it out of my model and I want to model gaming revenue organically."""
