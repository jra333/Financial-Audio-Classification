NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today we're going to take a look at the cryptocurrency LTO, which is LTO network and I'm just going to do another update video based off of some prior videos that I've already made on this one."
NEUT1|So the last video I kind of drought this rising trend line that I wanted to see Holdest support and when it was lossed it kind of went down to the next logical level which was right around this breakout spot.
BULL2|You know around that like 7374 cent level consolidated a little bit and is now pushing up again towards highs.
BULL3|It broke that 90 cent mark today.
BULL4|And it cracked this previous high from April 2nd.
BULL5|So at this point, what I want to see is a little bit more volume start to come in and I want to see this one continue to push higher.
NEUT6|If it does start to pull back some of the levels, I'd want to see hold or like that 84 anywhere from like the 82 to 84 cent level.
NEUT7|I would want to see a higher low.
BEAR8|If it does start to pull back from this level in the low 70s.
NEUT9|So anything above that really kind of in this range would keep this one looking bullish between like 82 to 85 I guess would be like a pretty nice spot to see hold.
NEUT10|If it does start to pull back.
BULL11|But what I'd be looking for is an increase in volume, and for this one really to start to push towards $1.00, because that's kind of like the next logical, psychologically both logical and psychological level to watch.
BULL12|So I really do think that this one has potential to hit a dollar, and if it does crack that dollar mark with some volume, I don't see any reason why this one can't continue higher anywhere.
NEUT13|It's from like a dollar $10.20 and then if it really picks up some volume, you know even higher than that in the short term.
BEAR14|But again, some of the levels you want to see holds probably like $0.87, but the big levels to hold really are afraid to base out and start to curl back up, making a higher low from this level right in the low 70s mid to low 70s.
NEUT15|So anywhere really, if it starts to base out like here and curl back up, you know that will probably spark this one straight to a dollar.
BULL16|But again, this one still has the potential from here to test that dollar mark.
NEUT17|So those are just some of the things I'd be watching for really like this one's pretty much at those highs.
BULL18|All it needs is an increase of volume, more eyes coming on this one and it just continued to be upside again.
BULL19|Support risk level, like $0.87, then consolidation between like 82 to 84 cents would keep this one looking healthy.
