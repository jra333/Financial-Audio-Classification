NEUT0|"""Hi, today is December 29th."
NEUT1|I did a video earlier on the trade desk.
NEUT2|Ticker symbol is TTD and I said that I bought 25 shares and it was only going to be a swing trade an I got rid of it just now.
BULL3|It was a quick trade actually.
NEUT4|I bought it this morning and I just saw that it is 12:24 PM and I say I wanted to make only a couple hundred $300.00 and I was able to make $200.
NEUT5|So we go here.
NEUT6|My PNL 222.
NEUT7|We go to orders so the first time I got filled was this morning it was at 8:32 so I bought 20 shares at 808 I bought another five shares.
NEUT8|At 8:48 AM and it was for 799.
NEUT9|And then I just sold it right now.
NEUT10|It got filled.
NEUT11|12:23 PM so 25 shares added adds $815.00 so it was a quick.
NEUT12|One day trade for me.
NEUT13|I love quick one day trades because you know, quick money, but this was.
BULL14|This was a quick trade because there was a major sell off yesterday.
BEAR15|Like I mentioned in the video, it was down 100 points I believe yesterday and then this morning it was down 30 points.
BEAR16|It's now only down 16 points right now, so I don't know how the next couple weeks will go, but we'll just have to see.
BULL17|I might get back in if it does continue to sell off again tomorrow.
BULL18|"So thanks for watching."""
