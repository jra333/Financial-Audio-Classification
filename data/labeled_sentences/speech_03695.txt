NEUT0|"""Let's talk about sort of what the at least the market is betting on broadly, and that is divided government, limited tax policy, movement, limited regulatory policy movement."
NEUT1|Is it your sense that a Biden administration is willing to oblige?
BULL2|No, I think President elect President Biden would first of all be good at working with Congress.
BULL3|That's something he's always been good at, so I'm very positive on a stimulus happening.
NEUT4|I hope it doesn't have to be wait to be signed by him.
NEUT5|I'd rather it happen in the next month.
NEUT6|There is infrastructure is another area that no matter what happens in the Senate, he'd be able to work with them on.
NEUT7|But he also cares about things like making sure workers have decent pay, making sure we're reducing our.
NEUT8|Carbon emissions and he's going to do what he can with his regulatory authority to advance those agendas as well.
NEUT9|You know, Jason, one thing that people who have supported the former Vice president have said in talking about his beliefs.
NEUT10|As we know Joe, they say it over and over again.
NEUT11|You can look at his voting record.
NEUT12|You can look at what he did with the Obama administration.
NEUT13|We know Joe, but he has tended to move where the party moves and you know, he told an aide of Bernie Sanders.
NEUT14|I want to be the most progressive president since FDR.
NEUT15|He's continually described himself as a transition candidate to the next generation.
NEUT16|He is clearly a candidate and a leader who is evolving and I'm wondering what you think an actual economic agenda would look like in reflecting that.
NEUT17|Look, I think he outlined a very set of ambitious plans in his campaign plans around infrastructure or an clean energy around childcare around health care.
NEUT18|He will try to figure out how to do as much of that as possible.
NEUT19|I none of that, by the way, is some undermining of capitalism or markets or anything like that.
NEUT20|I think it's a continuation with the types of economic policy, as you saw in the Obama administration.
BULL21|I think the economy did perfectly fine.
BULL22|In those years, and I think if he got everything he wanted done, the economy would be perfectly fine.
NEUT23|Of course, he won't be able to get everything he wants done, and that's the second important thing to know about him is.
NEUT24|I think he knows how to work together with others and.
NEUT25|Figure out what can be done.
NEUT26|Move ahead, not just sit on the side grandstand and make speeches.
NEUT27|There has been a view that you don't raise taxes in a recession.
NEUT28|That was something that President Obama said often during the last financial crisis.
NEUT29|And even with the limitations on what a Democratic White House would be able to do based on the composition of Congress, how qualified do you think that is in the minds of Biden and his advisers?
NEUT30|If you look at the plans he proposed for the next two years on net, they don't raise taxes.
NEUT31|There are gross tax increases on high income households and corporations.
NEUT32|There are gross tax cuts, those cancel out when you add in another one or $2 trillion of stimulus.
NEUT33|It would be an economic plan that on NET was expansionary and that's why every estimate I've seen from a variety of investment banks and others shows that his agenda would be positive for economic growth over the next few years.
NEUT34|Even even if you did, those changes on the tax side, which by the way are obviously politically more difficult today than you might have thought two days ago.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
