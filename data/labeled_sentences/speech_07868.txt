BULL0|"""Welcome to charts that count and welcome more importantly to the Everything Rally."
NEUT1|The price of just about every financial asset is headed up and they are headed up in Unison.
NEUT2|Let's take just a couple of examples.
NEUT3|Start with U.S. stocks which are right back up against their all time highs or look at junk bonds which are enjoying a screaming rally.
NEUT4|Finally, consider commodities, gold and iron ore are jamming.
NEUT5|Even oil is rising and the world has too much of that stuff.
NEUT6|What is the explanation for all of this synchronized exuberance?
BULL7|The most popular theory has it that a powerful combination of activism by the Federal Reserve and other central banks and low growth expectations have driven real bond yields.
BEAR8|That is, inflation adjusted bond yields down below 0.
NEUT9|This means to simplify only slightly, that borrowing costs.
NEUT10|Are negligible.
NEUT11|Or to put it another way, that money.
NEUT12|Is free.
NEUT13|Under those conditions, no asset price can be too high.
NEUT14|After all, you can always borrow more free money and pay a higher price.
BEAR15|Furthermore, the market has concluded that real rates will be low or even negative.
NEUT16|For a very long time.
NEUT17|Now the market could be wrong about how long these super low rates will be with us.
NEUT18|It could also be wrong about the relationship between super low rates and other asset prices, but what is especially worrisome right now?
BEAR19|Is that in a downturn?
NEUT20|It used to be investors.
NEUT21|Best defense was diversification.
NEUT22|Owning a mixed basket of different kind of assets meant that some asset you owned would always be outperforming at least relatively at any given time.
NEUT23|But in the recent rally, everything has gone up together and the rally has been explained by a single simple fact.
NEUT24|Low real rates.
NEUT25|"If that theory is correct, when the downturn comes, there will be no place to hide."""
