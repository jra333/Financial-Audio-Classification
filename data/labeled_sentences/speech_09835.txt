NEUT0|"""We start that today with that Georgia runoff going on to determine 2 Senate seats and whether they will go to Democrats or Republicans are Jessica Smith is monitoring that and I believe we have some live shots as well of people voting down in Georgia."
NEUT1|Just a lot of people voted in advance, but again, the reminder here that the stakes are high, it's going to determine the control of the Senate.
NEUT2|Yeah, the stakes really could not be higher here they will control who or determine who controls the Senate and that will really set the stage for the bike d'administration.
BEAR3|If Republicans win just one seat, they maintain control of the Senate and they can block much of Biden's agenda.
NEUT4|If Democrats win, they have to win both.
NEUT5|It will be a 5050 split in the Senate with Vice President elect Harris casting that tie breaking vote.
BEAR6|The races are expected to be close today as a reminder, Republican Senator David Perdue is taking on challenger John.
NEUT7|Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock is challenging Republican Senator Kelly Leffler.
NEUT8|Now both the president and the President elect were campaigning in Georgia yesterday.
BULL9|Biden made the case that if Democratic senators are in control, if they are elected, that will mean another $2000 stimulus.
NEUT10|Check for most Americans, while President Trump spent most of the time contesting his own loss in Georgia.
NEUT11|Let's watch.
NEUT12|The power the power is literally in your hands.
NEUT13|Unlike anytime in Mycareer one state, one state.
NEUT14|Can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation tomorrow.
BULL15|Our entire nation is counting on the people of Georgia in a way the world is counting on.
NEUT16|The people of Georgia, the fate of our country is at stake.
NEUT17|It's in your hands.
NEUT18|You must deliver a Republican victory so big that the Democrats can't steal it or cheated away.
NEUT19|And polls are open until 7:00 PM today, but more than 3,000,000 people have already voted early.
NEUT20|And it's important to remember we may not know right away who wins these races.
NEUT21|If you remember back in November, it took about a week and a half before we were really sure that Biden won the state of Georgia.
NEUT22|Local officials have made some small changes since then to potentially speed up the process, but it might be a little bit before we actually.
NEUT23|No, who wins these races?
NEUT24|Miles and Julie?
BULL25|"Thanks Jess, appreciate it."""
