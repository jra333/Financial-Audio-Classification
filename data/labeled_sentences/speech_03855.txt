BEAR1|Gov suggested that the Conservatives could fail to win an overall majority in the UK's June 8th general election.
BEAR2|The post is findings caught the market's attention when they were released during Asian trade and the pressure stayed on the pound for much of the European morning by enough for it to fall under its closing level on April the 18th.
NEUT3|The day Theresa May called the election.
BEAR4|But the pound pad it's losses is a more nuanced view of the research emerged and the less dramatic findings of other polls were factored into investors thinking Sterling fought back from its low point under $1.28 back above that level, leaving it steady overall on the session.
NEUT5|Analysts currently agree that the importance of UK politics as the main near term influence on the currency is difficult to overstate.
