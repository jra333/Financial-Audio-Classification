NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel to market trading here and today we're going to be talking about Churchill Capital Corp ticker symbol C Civ.
NEUT2|And their expected merger with Lucid Motors today.
BULL3|CC Ivy spiked up over 27% to hit all time highs of $35.18 and the chart still look very bullish in my opinion.
NEUT4|I'm going to go over why I think CC Ivy and Lucid Motors are gonna merge and also drop some big news for you guys that I think will make you want to get into.
NEUT5|See Civ in the future if we go ahead and take a look at the Arizona Corporation Commission website.
NEUT6|We can see that lucid Motors just applied to reserve their name to go public.
NEUT7|This right here shows us that Lycid Motors is planning on going public in the future and they have up until May 22nd of 2021 to make it happen.
NEUT8|This news right here makes me want to believe that CC ivyann lucid Motors are in fact going to merge very soon now guys, this is all just rumors.
NEUT9|There really isn't an official merger date for CC Ivy or Lucid Motors, but word on the street and based off the rumors, it looks like C Civ.
BULL10|And lucid Motors are going to plan on merging very soon, and as you can see from CCTV's charts, they have been uptrending pretty well the past couple of days until today, where they actually hit an all time high of $35.18 before finally closing out the day at $32.14.
NEUT11|Now, for those of you that want to get into CCIV, I'm going to go over a couple of key support and resistance levels that you guys should be watching for and also give you guys my prediction of how I think the stock is going to play out heading into the future.
NEUT12|Now guys, there really isn't any official news or merger date between CC Ivy or Lucid Motors, so this is all based off speculation and rumors.
BULL13|But as you can see here, the share price did shoot up 27% today to hit all time highs for the stock at $35.18.
NEUT14|Now with no official news or official data coming out, this is all just based off rumors.
BEAR15|So honestly this run up I think is going to pull back 50% of what it ran up through.
BULL16|So if it ran up from $29.00 to $35.
NEUT17|Then my medium in between would probably be this $31 range.
NEUT18|So what I'm going to do here is we're going to look at the $31 line as our first level of support, so the second level of support that I drew out is the $33 at 11 cent line.
BULL19|And as you can see here, postmarket CC Ivy ran up to $33.11, so heading into tomorrow, this is going to be our second level of support that we're going to be looking at now.
NEUT20|Going into tomorrow.
NEUT21|If CC Ivy can hold the second level of support here, then the first level of resistance that I'm going to be looking at.
NEUT22|Is the $33.74 line now?
BEAR23|If they can just uptrend in between this range right here and break this first level of resistance then I'm expecting that this can short squeeze past the $35 high and potentially break into the 37 or $38.00 range.
