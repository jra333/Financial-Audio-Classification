NEUT0|"""1st on the on the bull side, there's a lot of people we tend to forget."
NEUT1|There's a lot of people even in 2019 who still shopped almost exclusively at the mall who never shopped online.
NEUT2|So millions of people started shopping on line in 2020, who hadn't before and they they loved it.
NEUT3|And it was convenient and interesting and and so we brought a lot of people into e-commerce who weren't there before on the bear side during the pandemic, people can't spend on travel, they can't spend on dining, so they're spending a disproportionate share of wallet.
NEUT4|On retail and when they're spending on retail, they can't go to the mall so they're spending a disproportionate amount on E Commerce.
NEUT5|So what I don't know, and what I don't know that any of us know is what's going to happen to consumer spending.
NEUT6|Overall, as you know, as as restrictions ease, what I do know, though, is if you look over the long term.
BULL7|If you're looking at 2022 and 2023 and beyond, E Commerce is bigger and stronger and will be bigger and stronger.
NEUT8|I believe as a result.
NEUT9|Josh as you know Elon Musk tweeted on January 26.
BULL10|I hope you've saved the tweet.
NEUT11|I kind of love it.
NEUT12|See how much was that tweet worth.
NEUT13|You think this quarter?
NEUT14|You know?
NEUT15|Ed see trades on the fundamentals and is always traded on the fundamentals.
BEAR16|So at the time that he sent that Tweet, Etsy stock price went up.
NEUT17|I forget the amount, but I think we gained a billion and a half $2 billion market cap for two hours and then the stock price settled right back down to where it started before the tweet.
NEUT18|By the way he was tweeting about the fact that he loves the Etsy marketplace he was tweeting about.
NEUT19|A product that he bought for his dog which which I love but you know we trade on the fundamentals and I think it's so important that we keep talking about the fundamentals and I hope that's the stock always trades on the fundamentals and not on some story that that's other than that.
NEUT20|You thinking at all about accepting Bitcoin?
NEUT21|Not right now.
NEUT22|I'm a Holder.
NEUT23|I've held Bitcoin for six or seven years now.
NEUT24|I think on the theory that I think it can be an interesting store of value.
NEUT25|It could be an interesting tender someday, but you need a whole lot more people to buy it and own it before I think it's really useful for people as a form of tender.
NEUT26|And then finally I want to ask you about how you see the marketplace world versus the website or store world.
NEUT27|Given the success of Shopify, how many of your?
NEUT28|Small businesses are both on on your service and also developing their own.
NEUT29|And what does that mix look like for you?
NEUT30|You know many of our sellers will also have their own shop.
NEUT31|The challenge is creating your own shop today is is is is creating a lemonade stand in the desert right?
NEUT32|It's harder and harder for an individual site to rise above the noise and become a brand that people can remember.
NEUT33|All the trends I see is that you know we're consolidating to fewer and fewer large e-commerce platforms, and that's because the human brain can only remember so many brands.
NEUT34|We can only keep 4568 brands in mine.
NEUT35|For everything else, we've got to go to Google, and we've gotta go to Facebook and and if your downstream of Google or Facebook, then they're going to be the ones who get all of the economics.
NEUT36|So I don't think it's likely that there's going to be 2,000,000 driving individual places to go buy things 10 years from now.
NEUT37|I think there's going to be a handful, so the job of Etsy is to create a brand that stands for something that's meaningful and lift all of our sellers up his result.
