NEUT0|"""Here's what we're learning at this at this moment."
BEAR1|In terms of these margin calls, the cause of these ripple effects were learning how we're learning how some of the banks helped Bill Wang make all these large leveraged bets less than a decade after he was punished for his part in the insider in insider trading scheme, by the time you mirroring Credit Suisse announced yesterday that they had faced losses that could be highly significant, Goldman and Morgan's Joe and Becky were just mentioning had already finished unloading their positions.
NEUT2|But in terms of how this happens, it's a little more complicated than a bank.
NEUT3|Just turning around saying we're out.
BEAR4|What was happening last week was you saw some of the big Chinese names that Bill Wayne had been in falling, falling precipitously by mid week.
NEUT5|You had the Viacom situation, which was also something they owned an obviously discovery as well.
NEUT6|Now it was at that point that the bank started to call and make margin.
NEUT7|Margin calls, effectively saying can you can you come up with the money?
BEAR8|It was less clear as the week went on that they could come up with the money.
NEUT9|And yes, as Joe just said they were saying please give us more time now interestly.
NEUT10|Interestingly, some of the banks including Goldman.
NEUT11|Contractually have to give their clients time.
NEUT12|In fact, they had what was called a margin account and that meant that they would have to get a 2024 hours notice effectively to quote cure.
NEUT13|The problem.
NEUT14|That's what would happen.
NEUT15|They have to cure the problem.
NEUT16|However, Morgan Stanley Credit Suisse, the way their accounts are set up are different.
NEUT17|They can actually almost unilaterally.
NEUT18|Call a default if you will.
NEUT19|Now the second a bank calls a default on an ARCA goes it creates a cross default.
NEUT20|If you will for all the banks and so that then affectively the Stampede begins and that's what happened.
NEUT21|So you had banks like Goldman Sachs and others who wanted to get out who couldn't affect me or couldn't press the button to say go they actually had to wait for Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley to go first.
NEUT22|Which raises some questions about why Credit Suisse.
NEUT23|Since they were one of the first to go or to get out effectively to call the default didn't get out of more of these names themselves as fast as Goldman and Morgan appeared to have.
NEUT24|We'll see well, Goldman and Morgan had to have been bracing for this and be prepared for it and but just been ready to move a lot faster, which is, you know, something Goldman is now.
NEUT25|It appears that Goldman Goldman was waiting to do this.
NEUT26|They wanted to and Morgan Stanley, I think you know.
NEUT27|Interestingly, you look at who's running those banks.
NEUT28|And also their role in the financial crisis.
NEUT29|And I'm thinking of James now.
NEUT30|Morgan Stanley, who's seen the crisis David solve the crisis and I think that if you look at some of the names were running from the other firms at the time.
NEUT31|I mean at Credit Suisse now and some of the others.
NEUT32|I'm not going to make judgments about risk management, but nonetheless I think they were all on it, so to speak, but not clearly on it enough in terms of what Credit Suisse and Numero are now dealing with, but they were all.
BEAR33|They also had potentially even bigger loans outstanding, so it might have been harder for them to get out as quickly.
