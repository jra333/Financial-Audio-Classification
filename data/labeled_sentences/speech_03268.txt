BEAR0|"""What's going on in Florida?"
NEUT1|How?
NEUT2|How is business?
BULL3|Or business has been pretty good.
NEUT4|We actually operate three centers in the state of Florida, where 94% open traffic spin off, probably about 30 to 40%.
BEAR5|But sales have only been off about 20% year to date over last year.
NEUT6|During the same.
BULL7|With a lot of the luxury brands athleisure business athletic footwear business have been up double digits compared to last year, so it's been a broad spectrum, definitely Florida.
BEAR8|As the increase in cases have a curd, we've had sporadic shutdown of a few retailers.
BULL9|Over the course of time that have reopened, but Florida's come back fairly well.
NEUT10|What's drawing people to the mall?
NEUT11|You know what?
BULL12|I think there is a pent up demand for consumers.
NEUT13|I think a lot of stimulus money, I think pent up demand.
BEAR14|I mean they were really shut out of regional balls for many months.
NEUT15|As you know, there's an E Commerce platform that works hand in hand with brick and mortar.
NEUT16|And then how you get those goods and services seamlessly to the consumer is going to be really the future of our business.
NEUT17|You have to almost become agnostic as to how you sell your goods and services.
NEUT18|If you're a retailer through both the E Commerce platform, the delivery platform and the brick and mortar platform.
NEUT19|I'm curious what you make of the mall owners who are looking to buy or partner with some of the bankrupt retailers in order to keep them going.
BULL20|Kind of a win win.
NEUT21|If it goes well and they can ride out the pandemic for a couple of years, is that something you would ever consider taking part in?
NEUT22|Yeah, I don't know that it fits our platform real well, but for a company like Simon and Brookfield it's it's.
NEUT23|It's very, very ingenious strategy actually.
BULL24|If they can buy these retailers at the right price, be able to reinvent the retailers, reduce their store base, keep good occupancy in the shopping centers in the case of assignment organization when you have 250 malls both off price and full price, you gotta maintain occupancy.
NEUT25|You gotta have a good cross section of best in class retail in all categories, and it's something that you know when you have eight and half.
NEUT26|Billion dollars access on your balance sheet.
BULL27|"It's something that's worth absolutely taking a look at and could be a great future vertical of business for them."""
