NEUT0|"""What else can't be touched?"
NEUT1|The bags I know, did they look cheap?
NEUT2|Holy cow people come on say hey you want value it's the banks now I know they got big yields but this group got shelled today for reason.
NEUT3|I want you to look at Wells Fargo.
NEUT4|No delete alert tries.
NEUT5|He maybe come with some visian or something.
BULL6|It's a good franchise.
BULL7|Terrific new CEO, Charlie Scharf.
NEUT8|The backing of Warren Buffett.
BULL9|Meaningful insider buying bountiful 9% yield.
NEUT10|She's pretty darn enticing that Wells Fargo has three problems.
NEUT11|3 properties.
NEUT12|While they have a long book that's highly diverse fight.
NEUT13|The fact is they don't make much money on those loans right now.
BEAR14|They're looking at a lot more defaults and ultra low rates mean they can't make as much money on your deposits as a stock goes lower.
BEAR15|I start wearing something is very wrong here.
BEAR16|Maybe too many businesses are closed at all money.
BEAR17|Maybe they're giving forbearance to too many customers may be the dividend is safe as it looks, specially because a high ranking Fed officials just yesterday talked about preserving capital through cutting dividends.
NEUT18|That's all we need to see, right?
NEUT19|I mean, would you just be like it would be?
NEUT20|No, thank you at the end of the day.
NEUT21|You do not want a credit risk on your in your portfolio during a recession or yet.
NEUT22|Let's call it the D word, a depression if we don't open the economy soon, or if we open it too soon and we get another covid wave more powerful in the first Scylla Charybdis.
BULL23|Google it as crazy as it is, it might sound, you know what I'd much rather own PayPal up 33% for the year.
BEAR24|Cluding $2.70 today.
BEAR25|In Wells Fargo, down 58% for the year, including a 6% loss in today's session, it PayPal stock goes down.
BULL26|I feel confident to buy more.
BEAR27|Wells Fargo keeps going down I. I'd be terrified.
NEUT28|It's not just wells, I gotta bunch of stories say about PNC sold off its precious stake in BlackRock this morning.
NEUT29|The huge fabulous asset manager raising $14 billion.
NEUT30|They say to funds for the article say fund some acquisitions in the banking space, shrewd acquisitions the bankers who handled the actual BlackRock offering place.
NEUT31|28.8 million shares at $420.
BULL32|BlackRock stock then rocketed back to four $8565 profit guidance on that deal.
BEAR33|But this talk of PNC dropped more than 3 bucks.
BULL34|I think black rocks are much better investment than any bank.
NEUT35|PNC might want to buy here.
NEUT36|We don't get a V shaped recovery.
NEUT37|I'm betting these guys need every penny they can scrape together.
NEUT38|In fact, that's why I'm betting where they sold the Black Rock and after the risk Fed Chief Jaypal outline today, I don't think we're going to have a V shape recovery, which means you can't buy banks.
NEUT39|I don't think we have yellow already know if we have a swoosh.
NEUT40|I don't know.
NEUT41|We have one.
