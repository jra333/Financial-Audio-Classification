NEUT0|"""In essence, negative yielding bonds mean investors pay more than the face value of a bond plus interest payments, thereby accepting a guaranteed loss if they hold it to maturity."
NEUT1|First we need to understand the relationship between bond prices and yields or bonds trade at a price which is inversely related to its yield.
NEUT2|In simple terms, when a bond price rises, the yield falls.
NEUT3|When the bond price drops, the yield rises.
NEUT4|Governments and companies regularly sell bonds that pay a coupon or fixed rate of interest over the life of the issue.
NEUT5|If a bond is sold with a coupon of say 1% and the price is set at 100 or park, the yield is 1%.
NEUT6|Should the bond price for below 100 the yield arise while the price above 100 junior life of a bond means investors who initially bought that issue now have a capital gain.
BULL7|Well, for banks buying that German five year at minus 0.08% is better than placing their money on deposit at the European Central Bank, which currently has a minus .02% rate for deposits.
NEUT8|And now that we've mentioned the ECB, we can elaborate further and this really gets down to the major burning question here.
BULL9|The central bank plans to start buying massive amounts of bonds in the coming months in order to jumpstart the eurozone economy.
BEAR10|So there is a very good chance bond yields will fall further into negative territory, as the ECB and other central banks buy up huge amounts of debt.
BULL11|"That will push prices higher and means investors will reap a capital gain that offsets a negative yield."""
