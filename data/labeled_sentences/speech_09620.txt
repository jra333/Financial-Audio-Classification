NEUT0|"""Santo Siciliano adores living by the water."
BEAR1|I grew up on sure, so for me it's a no brainer, but the flood risk to his oceanport New Jersey home is getting higher.
BULL2|So in order to stay he needed to lift the house higher.
NEUT3|It's just something that, unfortunately, that we're faced with, you know whether its climate change or anything else.
BEAR4|The Siciliano's lifted their home because when they decided to renovate, they had to comply with new local flood zone building codes.
BEAR5|There's is now one of several houses on the street that was lifted fairly safe.
NEUT6|Into an art.
NEUT7|Brian Hess is a foreman for Wolf House and building movers.
NEUT8|He's lifted all kinds of homes from small ones like this, just 7000 square foot mansion's got a lot of work from Hurricane Sandy, and there will be plenty more New Jersey tops.
NEUT9|The list of states with the most homes that based on projected sea level rise will see at least one major flood per year by 2050, more than 70,000 homes, according to Climate Central.
NEUT10|It's followed by Florida, California.
NEUT11|Louisiana and North Carolina from homes on the Jersey Shore to a 2000 ton historic waterfront building in San Francisco.
NEUT12|As the water rises, so too must the real estate.
NEUT13|Any of the coastal areas any of the areas with large rivers.
NEUT14|Michael Brovont has been in the house lifting business for nearly two decades, working residential and commercial projects, he says, lifts start around $10,000 for a small home to over $1,000,000 for a large historic building.
NEUT15|But the more that things.
NEUT16|Flood them or there's going to be a need for it.
NEUT17|For some, the flood risk is all part of the waterfront reward, and so they try to rise above it.
BEAR18|We're sure people something about not being able to get to the beach in less than 10 minutes.
NEUT19|That's something I wanted to do.
NEUT20|Now the risk from rising water is high, but the risk of lifting the house is actually not that bad.
NEUT21|These companies say that it is a precise, gentle, almost ginger practice that happens very slowly and carefully.
NEUT22|You can actually in some cases leave your furniture inside.
NEUT23|That said, there can of course be damage, and that's why there is special insurance for these jobs for both the company and the home ownership.
