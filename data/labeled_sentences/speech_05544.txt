NEUT0|"""Hello everyone analytics Search Friday 15th of January 2020 one 2:37 AM UK time Amazon."
NEUT1|I'm giving you an update so.
NEUT2|It seems that you are going for the last wave of Amazon.
NEUT3|To be honest, I was checking most of the stocks all over the world every most of the stocks are in their last wave Wave 5, so I think people who had long positions for a long time.
NEUT4|You can start thinking of profit taking because this is the last impulsive probably.
NEUT5|So first of all, my invalidation level for Amazon is here.
NEUT6|If under any circumstance we touch 2955.
BEAR7|Dis analysis is invalidated.
NEUT8|Ignore the video.
NEUT9|So this is based on the fact that we are not going down so the market can come down a little bit, but should not even touch 2955.
NEUT10|If that happens and the market goes up, I'm gonna wait for the breakout of this level initially.
NEUT11|City City 55 and then we are going up.
NEUT12|The first target is three 8021.
NEUT13|The second target is 4275 and in my opinion that should be the end of Amazon for now and then we will see a correction or maybe a long correction.
BULL14|"Thanks for watching and have a good night."""
