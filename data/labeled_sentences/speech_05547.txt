NEUT0|"""I made 10 or 15 times my money in Dunkin' Donuts."
NEUT1|Those are the kind of stocks I can understand.
NEUT2|If you don't understand it doesn't work.
BEAR3|This is the single biggest principle, and it bothers me that people are very careful in the money.
NEUT4|The public when they buy refrigerator, they get a Consumer Reports they buy micro and they do that.
NEUT5|They ask people what's the best kind of radar range or what kind of car to buy.
NEUT6|They do research.
NEUT7|On apartments, when they go to, when they go on a trip to Wyoming and get the mobile travel guide or California when they go to Europe they get the Michelin Travel Guide.
NEUT8|People here a tip on a bus on some stock and they'll put half their life savings in it before sunset and they wonder why they lose money in the stock market and when they lose money they blame it on the institutions in program trading.
NEUT9|That is garbage.
NEUT10|They didn't do any research that piece of junk.
NEUT11|They didn't look at the balance sheet and that's what you get for it.
NEUT12|And that's what we were being driven to.
NEUT13|And it's self fulfilling.
NEUT14|The public does terrible investing and they say they don't have a chance.
NEUT15|It's because.
NEUT16|That's the way there is.
NEUT17|That's the way they're acting.
NEUT18|I'm trying to convince people there is a method.
NEUT19|There are reasons for stocks that go up.
NEUT20|Coca Cola, this is very magic.
NEUT21|It's a very magic number.
BULL22|Easy remember, Coca-Cola is earning 30 times per share.
NEUT23|What they did 32 years ago.
BULL24|The stock has gone up 30 fold.
BEAR25|Bethlehem Steel is earning less than they did 30 years ago.
NEUT26|The stock is half its price of 30 years ago.
NEUT27|Stocks are not lottery tickets.
NEUT28|Is a company behind every stock.
BULL29|The company does well the stock as well.
NEUT30|It's not that complicated.
NEUT31|People get too carried away and first of all they try and predict the stock market.
BEAR32|That is a total waste of time.
NEUT33|No one can predict the stock market.
NEUT34|They try to predict interest rates.
NEUT35|I mean this is it.
NEUT36|If anyone predict interest rates right three times in a row that be a billionaire concerned, there's not that many billionaires on the planet.
NEUT37|It's very, you know.
NEUT38|I took logic.
NEUT39|So had a syllogism in the studies.
NEUT40|Was a Boston College.
NEUT41|They can't be that many people.
NEUT42|"Biggest race would be lots of billionaires."""
