BEAR0|"""This is the one time where the market edge oscillator failed."
BEAR1|OK, this is what I think is the outlier the Great Recession.
NEUT2|If you bought stocks when the oscillator hit minus 12 back then well guess what?
BEAR3|You did get smoked because we were dealing with the true financial crisis where nearly all of our biggest banks and big insurers to or danger of going under the government, particularly the Fed, had no idea how bad things were.
NEUT4|By the time the Fed started cutting rates aggressively, it was too little, too late.
BEAR5|Stock market got more than cut in half before it bottomed and many of our famous financial institutions became let's just say, moribund.
NEUT6|Now, is this coronavirus panic more like the financial crisis here, or is it like this this this, this, this, which is it like?
NEUT7|What is it like of the minus 12 to four times?
NEUT8|It worked in recent history.
NEUT9|There was no credit crisis.
NEUT10|There were no big failures.
NEUT11|There was no systemic risk.
NEUT12|The one time we fail the bounce, we had all those problems.
NEUT13|The reason it was so wrong for the Fed to cut yesterday is that it made old hands like me, feel like there's gotta be this.
NEUT14|This is what we were reacted to, that it must be some credit crisis that we don't know about.
BEAR15|Some institutions on the version of failure come on Jay.
NEUT16|Just like in the Great Recession, that's what we thought you did, Jay.
NEUT17|They were trying to restore confidence.
NEUT18|All they did was still panic.
BULL19|Thank heavens we got over that quickly.
NEUT20|As I said over and over again.
BEAR21|This is a biological crisis with with economic fallout it could hurt.
BEAR22|Hiring could cause layoffs, but if the federal government helps tide over small businesses and the short term unemployed as Congress seems to want to do, I think will come out on the other side just fine even without breaks closing down Commerce all over the country.
BEAR23|I expect them all recession based on weakness and travel and entertainment, but right now the oscillators saying you should buy stocks both short and long term.
