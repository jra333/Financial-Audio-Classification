NEUT0|"""Alright man, let's take a look at the Apple stock price."
NEUT1|We can see here it from the right candle.
NEUT2|And this condo has a lower leg and also with a comparably larger volume.
BULL3|Compared to yesterday, so it means a lot of sale.
BEAR4|So as we can see from the news that the government has stopped negotiating further stimulate after.
BEAR5|The announcement from Trump and the market liquidity seems drying up, so it's very bearish for the.
NEUT6|Apple stock because it needs a lot of market liquidity.
BEAR7|So now in my opinion is still likely for Apple to drop down.
NEUT8|To the new law or even test the formula here.
NEUT9|So because we can see here.
NEUT10|It's very struggle to hold on the emmas so hold your money.
NEUT11|Don't go back too soon because I pull is the leader.
BEAR12|If the leader drop a lot, I think the whole market drop a lot.
BULL13|"Thank you."""
