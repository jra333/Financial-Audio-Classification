NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol BA Boeing."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, overall, the charts hanging in there, but if you look at just today it was a rough day.
NEUT5|Now when you look at just today, what happened was just a big old nasty gapping trap.
BEAR6|I mean, the price closed right there on Monday opened up there, hence what is known as a gap up.
NEUT7|If you're a beginner and then after that the market opened up prices basically rolled back over the rest of the day.
BEAR8|So today in and of itself not a good day, a bearish day, a gap in trap.
NEUT9|However, if you take a step back and look at more than just one day overall.
NEUT10|Like I said, the price is still hanging in there and you can see that.
NEUT11|Quote unquote hanging in there is how I'm defining 2:15 and I'm not saying this was going to actually happen by just from an explanation standpoint, let's say that the price does come down to 2:15 behaves in that manner.
NEUT12|And then continues on up.
NEUT13|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT14|Well, you'd still have a set of those there.
NEUT15|You'd have Lowe's down there if you envision each one of those stair steps.
BULL16|Well, hey there you go now you have stair step still making progress in the upward direction again from the bigger picture.
NEUT17|Overall viewpoint.
NEUT18|If you are some sort of day trader and you bought right there in your plan was to buy and sell within 20 minutes, then yeah, you don't care bout these stair steps, because again, these comments are being geared towards more.
NEUT19|So the overall viewpoint of things so today yet bearish day.
NEUT20|But one day doesn't make or break a sharp.
BEAR21|So yeah, today was bearish.
NEUT22|But I mean because the price still is up about 2:15.
BULL23|There is still some hope that maybe this thing is trying to get bottomed out.
BEAR24|Now if the price comes down to 2:15 and then just blast down through it at that point, now the chart is just getting overall bearish continuation of the trend.
BULL25|But right now the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base, which is important as far as areas of resistance.
NEUT26|The big stubborn level right now is all about that purple line.
NEUT27|There, the 50.
NEUT28|Moving average you can see that just time after time today the price try to get above it and couldn't quite do it.
NEUT29|So that will be that initial roadblock that will need to be cleared up through and then if the price can push through that level.
NEUT30|Next, he area of resistance.
NEUT31|After that would then be up there right around two 3315 ish.
NEUT32|So keep trying these levels moving forward.
BEAR33|But yeah, today a bad day, but overall the Bulls are hanging in there.
BULL34|They got a chance to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT35|So let's see what happens.
NEUT36|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT38|But it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL40|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT42|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR43|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT44|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT45|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT46|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT47|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
