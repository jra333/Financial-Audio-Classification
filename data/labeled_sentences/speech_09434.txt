NEUT0|"""What is going on?"
NEUT1|Welcome to the stock trend channel.
NEUT2|So in this video we're going over clean Spark ticker symbol CLSKV stock.
NEUT3|We're looking at the current daily chart.
BULL4|We're going to actually dive into some of the latest news so that we can find them take a closer look here at the chart, but really quick if you would not mind jumping down subscribing to the channel, hitting the thumbs up button and turning on those notifications, that was really, really appreciated here, as well as grabbing your three free stocks with people that's this desktop platform.

NEUT6|In the description, so here is the most recent piece of news as we're filming this video right now, so this came out November 10th at 9:25 AM.
NEUT7|Clean Spark has announced that they added Rachel Silverstein and Owen Cat will ladder to its management team and it is important to note that Silverstein is a former corporate counsel at Zappos, a company which is owned by Amazon and her role at Clean Spark is to serve as the vice president of Compliance and General Counsel.
NEUT8|Now generally with a piece of news like this.
NEUT9|Is not really anticipated to see too much price action unless it's a very very big name and so we don't really anticipate so much in the price action.
BEAR10|Overall market was down a little bit yesterday, so clean Spark was down.
NEUT11|Now taking a look here at the daily chart we put in here is we have this support line right here.
BULL12|So we had this prior level of consolidation.
BULL13|We came back up, came down, found some support here at the $6.88 of just around $7.00 or so.
BULL14|OK bounced up, came back down again.
BEAR15|Found support at $7.00 and I've started to put in an uptrend since they were coming back down a little bit.
BULL16|Today we're up.
BULL17|Just about 1% of the time we're filming this video, but it does look to be like we may have seen some resistance here around that $9.50 for right now.
NEUT18|So as of right now, it looks like $9.50.
BULL19|We're going to break above that after that, $10.
NEUT20|We've got 50 simple moving average.
NEUT21|The MA 50 here on the Weibo platform.
NEUT22|This blue line that $10 line is the next level we need to clear about that for a resume.
NEUT23|Move to the upside, if we cannot, it looks as if $7.00 is support.
BEAR24|If we do fall below that, then we could see a drawdown potentially under $6.
BEAR25|And potentially further if there is a further drawdown if there's no positive news, and if things continue to the downside, but to the North over $10 it looks like may have some resistance here by some of these tops in here around $11.00 and to be honest it looks like every whole number will be an area of resistance beyond $10.
NEUT26|Eleven dollars, $12.00.
NEUT27|Thirteen dollars.
NEUT28|Those could be very key.
BEAR29|This looks like a little bit of a gap we have right here from 1180 or so to just about 12:35.
BEAR30|That could be a little bit of a gap.
BEAR31|It could get filled if we do make a resume move to the upside.
NEUT32|And then eventually here over 1350 over these tops you want to look at these tops as areas of resistance in the past.
NEUT33|This 1350 or so will be a strong reason.
NEUT34|Looks like 14 and then after that 1514 is the high that we're going to have to break above for a further move.
BULL35|Any further break out to the upside, but it looks like that will probably take some time for us to get there, at least as of right now, so hopefully this video is helpful.
NEUT36|Hopefully it gives you something to think about.
