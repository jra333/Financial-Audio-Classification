NEUT0|"""I'm Dan Fitzpatrick."
NEUT1|Here at stock market mentor.
NEUT2|Com on Saturday, January 28th and I'm actually don't tell anybody, but I'm actually recording this on Friday the 27th.
NEUT3|I'm just acting like it's Saturday because that's when you're going to get it at the Warden Workshop in in La Jolla.
NEUT4|Talking to some people about this software that I use.
NEUT5|Actually, just my techniques.
NEUT6|So if I see you there awesome but look one of the things I was looking at.
NEUT7|Here is Netflix.
NEUT8|You know they announced great numbers I'd mentioned yesterday or actually on Wednesday that I thought this had a lot further to go that it could go a lot further.
BEAR9|An I believe that The thing is this stock sold off so hard for so long on just probably the most the purest and most blatant act of stupidity and arrogance.
NEUT10|I've ever seen in a publicly traded company, just unbelievable.
BULL11|So this thing took its lumps, but now we're seeing that the company is actually starting to get more.
NEUT12|You know, new subscribers, and So what this does is it sets the company or it sets the stock up as almost kind of a new growth story.
NEUT13|Clear back here in early 2010 was the last time the stock was at this level and then it continues higher.
NEUT14|So the point is, on this chart you look here.
BEAR15|I'm just reeling at the utter eragon's that that CEO exhibited in taking away stuff and jacking prices up.
NEUT16|Sorry, digression.
NEUT17|So here's the thing.
NEUT18|This thing can go from 120 clear up to 205 bucks and all it would really be doing is just simply retracing or I should say, filling this gap right here so I can't predict.
NEUT19|I mean, I guess I could, but I wouldn't have any credibility.
NEUT20|I can't predict that this stock is going to move up and close this gap completely, but I can do this.
BULL21|I'll predict that the stock moves higher from here.
NEUT22|Here's what I'm going to do.
BULL23|I mean, I've already got a pretty big position in this stock.
NEUT24|I'm going to stand by my prediction and less this gap starts to be filled, so if the stock falls into the red box then I will assume that I'm wrong, which oftentimes is a safe assumption.
NEUT25|And I will sell, so there's my risk.
NEUT26|I don't care about all of this stuff in here.
NEUT27|I don't care.
NEUT28|About all this stuff up here.
NEUT29|All I care about is this little level right there.
NEUT30|If the stock stays above this little teeny tiny box, then I can participate in all of this upside.
NEUT31|If the stock falls into this little teeny tiny box, then I don't have to worry about any of this stuff to the downside, 'cause I'm not going to be involved in the stock.
NEUT32|OK, alright look, that's it for this video guys long weekend update with three separate videos on some stuff, including I mean some things that I think are like right here right now moments.
NEUT33|"So I want you to get over there and check that out."""
