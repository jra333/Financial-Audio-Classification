NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol CLF."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level near Safeway.
NEUT7|One make this chart look the absolute best going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT8|Could say up there above $19.25 and don't get me wrong if the price falls below 1925.
BULL9|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage to actually step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT10|Taking a step back and look at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT11|That is, with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT12|Simple moving average keyword.
NEUT13|Definitely moving understand the price they appear at this line is way down there, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT14|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher when the Bulls are in full health.
NEUT15|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT16|Heard most visualize that.
NEUT17|That is what has been represented again.
BULL18|Sure stand with 1925 would be great.
NEUT19|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT20|First key battleground to watch.
NEUT21|Just going to be right there with the price basically struggled all day long.
NEUT22|Give or take right up around $20.25.
NEUT23|So keep an eye on that area and then after that just to offer up context as you're seeing here, that would be putting the price up at highs that have not been seen for weeks upon weeks.
NEUT24|So I mean I'd have no problem if you want to call that a Blue Sky breakout point.
NEUT25|So keep an eye on that.
NEUT26|But All in all.
NEUT27|Anyway, look at it Monster volume today.
NEUT28|Very impressive price movement, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT29|Moving forward.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT31|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT36|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
