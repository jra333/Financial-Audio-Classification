NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol SAVA."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Quite eventful day in this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT7|Never say you know what.
NEUT8|Make this chart look the absolute best going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT9|Could say up there above $60.00.
NEUT10|Now.
NEUT11|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 60.
NEUT12|I'm not saying that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL13|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view, that is, with the purple line, there comes into play the 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|Having most visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT19|Yeah, stand up 60 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100%.
NEUT20|Own the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT21|First level is just going to simply be where the price kind of stumbled around today and that was right up there.
BULL22|About $63.25 give or take if the price can push up through that area.
NEUT23|And then the next level, not until and I realize that things are getting a little bit harder to see her, but that's a good problem to have when you have to go back this far into the charts history.
NEUT24|But next key level after that would then be up there around 6575.
NEUT25|So keep running those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT26|But on all any angle you look at it.
BULL27|Very impressive volume today.
BULL28|Very nice volunteer, very nice price action to accompany that volume.
NEUT29|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT30|Let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT33|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT34|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR39|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
