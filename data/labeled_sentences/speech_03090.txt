BEAR0|"""Mark Zuckerberg has continued to tout new security measures as the social media giant is facing another major privacy scandal."
NEUT1|You know what?
NEUT2|Mark Zuckerberg you might be rich, but talk is cheap.
BEAR3|The Washington Post reports that more than 500,000,000 Facebook records, including user comments and account names, were left exposed by a third party company.
NEUT4|NBC's Ben Collins joins us.
NEUT5|Now I want to start with that because the average Facebook user I don't believe knows that a third party whenever have their information right average Facebook user who says thank God because my impression is so great I guess use the face.
NEUT6|Up all day long for free, but they don't know it's true.
NEUT7|This is the similar thing to the Cambridge Analytica scandal where earlier in this decade Facebook allowed pretty much random companies to take whatever they wanted right to do whatever they wanted with the with user data.
NEUT8|In this case, there was a there was a small company called at the pool like that's what it was called.
NEUT9|A Reuben knows what it is and they stored 22,000 passwords and swimming.
NEUT10|Are you doing there?
NEUT11|You do have to bring a swimsuit at the thing you cannot bring for cell phones or malware you go.
NEUT12|Search windows passwords next to usernames, basically in a plain text document, which is like a Word document.
NEUT13|Effectively where anybody has seen it and it was on the cloud was on Amazon servers.
NEUT14|If you knew where to find it, you could have found it, so that's the larger problem they have with their infrastructure from earlier in this decade.
NEUT15|They were just Willy nilly letting pretty much anybody do what they want with user data.
NEUT16|OK then, does Sheryl Sandberg or Mark Zuckerberg not oh the planet?
NEUT17|The answer to that?
NEUT18|Yeah, of course they do like this is this is this is going to be a decades long reckoning for how they they.
NEUT19|Strove strived, I don't know, whatever their growth exactly so like that that's what it is is.
BEAR20|There's a much larger problem from the past five years of all these companies Twitter the same thing to where they they stored.
NEUT21|Some passwords in plaintext last year to this thing because it was a less fraught moment politically, so that we're going the idea that people needed to expand at all costs earlier in this decade's Facebook.
NEUT22|Specifically, that's what made it so.
NEUT23|We have all these disasters now, and we're still going to pay for this couple years.
NEUT24|I make the argument to both of you.
NEUT25|I don't know, you know when we say, Oh my God, Facebook is a huge prob.
NEUT26|Do they really?
NEUT27|There's no pending regulations.
NEUT28|William.
NEUT29|The stock price is way up, user growth isn't down.
BEAR30|An ad revenue is down now for like a minute.
NEUT31|So the only problem they have is immediate problem.
NEUT32|Totally different question of men.
NEUT33|While he's here just 'cause he's like.
NEUT34|Andrew Yang this afternoon you could ask him, you know, during a commercial break and find well, because I want to.
NEUT35|I want to get an answer to the idea that Ben Collins hangs around in the deep web.
NEUT36|Andrew Yang's supporters do as well?
NEUT37|Yes, correct.
NEUT38|Why is that?
NEUT39|It's unclear what got them into the concept of liking Andrew Yang presidential candidate.
NEUT40|But we know that they love him.
NEUT41|It's 4 Chan specifically which got on the Donald Trump train.
NEUT42|Really kind of propelled him in the alt right to prominence are now on the Andrew Yang bandwagon and the Yang campaign is sort of toeing the line of like do we want this?
NEUT43|Do we want these people with us?
NEUT44|We don't really know yet.
