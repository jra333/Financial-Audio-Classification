BULL0|"""Welcome to market faster."
NEUT1|We blow apart the stock market and put it back together so that it makes sense for you.
NEUT2|INFORMS Markets editor John Dobos.
NEUT3|Well, we're taking a little trip down to the mall today.
NEUT4|Going to buy us some cheap shoes over at Payless Payless.
NEUT5|Of course is part of the PSS collective brands.
NEUT6|The company company was bought out for $21.75 per share by a private equity group and Wolverine Worldwide tickers WWW on that one.
NEUT7|How about that for a shoe company?
NEUT8|As part of the deal, three of the brands that were owned by Collective Brains, I want to Payless ticker is PSS.
NEUT9|You got your kids who doesn't love the kids boat shoes, Sperry top siders, and stride rite?
NEUT10|Some ladies pumps for 1575 over there.
NEUT11|They're going over to Wolverine Wolverine's best known perhaps for its big work boots and its Merrell shoes.
NEUT12|So the shoe company shoe companies doing a little bit of reorganizing here.
BULL13|Nice run from 9 bucks per share when things were tough.
NEUT14|Back in August for PSS collective brands to 2175.
BULL15|The buyout price, more than a double about 125% gain in those eight months.
NEUT16|Nice Golden Shoe right there, so collective brands, what else can we talk about?
NEUT17|We can talk about Wolverine.
NEUT18|One of the companies getting those brands they already have the work boots as I mentioned in the Merrell shoes, every good urban hipster or outdoors type likes to wear those around this office.
NEUT19|Anyway, look at Wolverine Worldwide, they're not doing too poorly right now.
BULL20|Stock is up about.
BULL21|8 bucks in the last week, Wolverine has $2 billion market capitalization trades at 15.7 * 2012 expected earnings per share revenue growing about 10%, so not as high as the PE.
BULL22|And I'm sorry EPS grown in 10% and revenue growing at 5.3%.
NEUT23|So Wolverine, although the stocks got lots of nice momentum, does not look particularly cheap right here.
NEUT24|Are companies out there Deckers then make of course the Uggs shoes you see.
NEUT25|A lot of ladies wearing those around the city when it gets cold and nice socks.
NEUT26|Tevas Divas.
NEUT27|Of course the outdoor sandals you can wear him when you go canoeing and stuff like that.
BEAR28|Deckers recently disappointed the street with its earnings.
BEAR29|Stock is down from 1:20 to darn near 60 bucks cut in half in just about that since December.
NEUT30|Late late November.
BULL31|Deckers is slowing down, but maybe they worked another look.
NEUT32|Deckers is.
NEUT33|Fairly cheap trading at about 11 times earnings.
BULL34|Sales grown about about that same rate so Deckers could be cheaper than Wolverine Worldwide.
NEUT35|Other stocks you want to consider, just do it right here.
NEUT36|Nike the Pride of Oregon Nike stock.
BULL37|Look at this two year chart cruising higher to over 100 bucks per share.
BULL38|Nike full of momentum.
BULL39|Yes, it might be a little bit expensive, but it's certainly sprinting ahead.
NEUT40|"Jump on Nike for little fun."""
