NEUT0|"""He talked more about the airlines and let's change from a couple of decades ago to now."
NEUT1|Well, I don't know that much about it, but I do know that it's more concentrated now.
NEUT2|And there's no real substitute for us.
NEUT3|Is like we have a substitute for air travel and and it's down to a friendly few players.
NEUT4|In the old days, they can always sorrow new airline.
NEUT5|They are nothing but young people.
NEUT6|They pay their pilots list.
NEUT7|They don't ever union and they could just start hitting the prices they just kept running the business over and over again.
NEUT8|And even now, Southwest is just starting to avoid so vicious competition is continuum, including people doing it for governments on these airlines and do it to show off how strong they are.
NEUT9|So I don't regard it as a perfect model, and I don't think it's the greatest idea we ever had.
NEUT10|It's just something considering how pounded they were and how the world is changed a little, we thought.
NEUT11|As I said, we had a little advantage by that particular gamble, but it's not that we it's not a St. Oil prices.
NEUT12|I don't think oil prices will make that much difference over the long term.
NEUT13|It's not that.
BULL14|Kerosene doubles in price.
NEUT15|I don't think overtime I don't get matters that much to the airlines.
NEUT16|It's still.
NEUT17|It's it's you put 100 people on airline earn fly somewhere.
NEUT18|It's pretty efficient.
NEUT19|Do a lot of flights per day.
NEUT20|That's worth a lot of money.
NEUT21|We will take the trip.
NEUT22|And.
NEUT23|Not going to be a new airport in Shanghai, you know a lot of the airports are fixed.
NEUT24|And a lot of them are having capacity.
NEUT25|It is.
BULL26|It's obviously better than it was.
NEUT27|In the past, whether it's good enough so it will do well, I don't know.
NEUT28|Also starts working.
NEUT29|You get paid in advance for the tickets.
NEUT30|So there's no credit.
NEUT31|Love you release the airliners so you make money.
NEUT32|You can pile up pretty rapidly in cash.
NEUT33|Ceres and JetBlue wasn't in there.
NEUT34|I don't really think about individual airlines.
NEUT35|Here is why we bought a bunch.
NEUT36|It was it was a secular man.
NEUT37|"It's not about an individual airline."""
