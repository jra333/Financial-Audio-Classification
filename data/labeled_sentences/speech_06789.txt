NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AAL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level here.
NEUT8|Say you know what?
NEUT9|Make this chart look the absolute best going forward and that would be the price.
NEUT10|Could say above 2375.
NEUT11|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 2375.
NEUT12|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL13|But yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL14|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of power moving forward.
NEUT15|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT16|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT19|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there have been defined as the move.
NEUT20|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT21|His visualize that.
BULL22|That is what is being represented again yeah, absolutely stand above 2375 would be great.
NEUT23|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, but bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|Gotta squeeze on the charger for this next key level of resistance to watch closely.
NEUT25|Which I believe the price is currently knocking on the door of yeah, right there around $24.25 and then after that next level up there right around that $25 Mark.
NEUT26|But All in all very nice movement today so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT27|Moving forward.
NEUT28|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL31|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
