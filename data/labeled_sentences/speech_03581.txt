BULL0|"""Hi, thanks for joining these quick session on Google Stock analysis in front of us."
NEUT1|There is one hour candle stick showing the price movement of Google Stock and as we can see if we can understand the process has been moving upward in a bullish market in bullish market, yes, bullish conditions since the middle of March.
NEUT2|The idea is to go long to gold.
NEUT3|Follow the major trend.
NEUT4|And just wanted to be sure when to get into this market.
NEUT5|So the idea is as we are right now is not returned to get in based on the stochastic as well because he's already overboard.
NEUT6|Perhaps it's better to wait a little bit more to wait that the stochastics gonna go now oversold so that the price will go down again after this level.
NEUT7|And then it's going to be a very good signal if the price will be there and then while the stochastic is in oversold, this good signal to go along and buy as it is now the press key.
NEUT8|Kim Kim booking.
NEUT9|Can going up or otherwise can go can go down.
NEUT10|So as we are right now, there is still some uncertainity for the price will start going up as soon as the market is just open 10 minutes ago.
NEUT11|Or perhaps it will go down a little bit before going up.
NEUT12|But both options are still valid.
NEUT13|So anyway in conclusion.
NEUT14|Even this one is more local short term analysis.
NEUT15|In conclusion, ideas to go along and idea is to go along.
NEUT16|If you want you can go wrong.
NEUT17|If you want to go now.
NEUT18|So assuming that this one we just move like date uptain.
NEUT19|So something like that.
NEUT20|Or perhaps just wait and wait if there would be a set back price before going up.
NEUT21|So those are the two options.
NEUT22|But again overall that is to go along because we would like to follow the technical analysis in formation.
NEUT23|End base even more fundamental analysis where yesterday the other let's say competitor so other ID Giants like Amazon, Apple, Mania, Ape, Apple and Facebook, Microsoft and perhaps even Amazon, if even if they do something different.
BULL24|But anyway they they have reached their all time highs.
BULL25|So the idea is that perhaps based on this good news, even Google is gonna reach its big.
BULL26|Its all time high.
NEUT27|In the next weeks or perhaps days?
NEUT28|That's all from my side, and this is my interpretation of those price movement.
BULL29|"Thanks for watching this video game."""
