BULL0|"""Here is a cheap cure for destructive covid lockdowns while complementing vaccines to curb the pandemic."
NEUT1|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to better navigate these turbulent times.
BEAR2|States and cities are imposing sweeping lockdowns as COVID-19 cases have surged.
BEAR3|Trouble is experienced, painfully demonstrates that such broad based lockdowns make little difference in overall results in fighting this disease and do real unnecessary harm in terms of lost wages, serious mental health problems and driving numerous small businesses.
BEAR4|Into bankruptcy policy makers, especially the heartless obtuse governors of states such as New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey, Michigan, Nevada and Pennsylvania, and New York City's indescribably incompetent Mayor Bolshevik.
BEAR5|Bill de Blasio have locked themselves into a deadly losing strategy.
BULL6|There is a fantastically better, more positive way forward.
NEUT7|Massive uses by people of cheap, self administered covert tests in their own homes, instant at home tests are no dream.
NEUT8|The FDA has just approved the first over the Counter Home Test for coronavirus that gives results in just 20 minutes and costs under $30.
NEUT9|No prescription needed.
NEUT10|The test is made by a loom and Australian manufacturing company.
NEUT11|It has a nasal swab analyzer.
NEUT12|That connects to an app on your smartphone.
NEUT13|Illume expects to produce 100,000 per day by next month and 250,000 by June.
NEUT14|Nice, but much more needs to be done.
NEUT15|We should be doing upwards of fifty million tests a day, and, amazingly, we can make this happen with a little testing stick.
NEUT16|You could swab your mouth or nose and get results in under 2 minutes at a cost of under $5.
BEAR17|The implications of this are staggering.
NEUT18|People would know instantly whether or not they have the disease.
NEUT19|No more blanket lockdowns which assume everyone might be a carrier.
BEAR20|This is a losing strategy.
NEUT21|Now we'd know in real time who is infected and who isn't.
NEUT22|If you have the virus, you isolate and get treatment.
NEUT23|Otherwise you can safely go about your business.
BEAR24|This way infected people are immediately out of circulation.
NEUT25|The sharply limiting the spread of the virus, Harvard's brilliant epidemiologist Doctor Michael Minor, points out that Congress could appropriate as little as one or $2 billion as seed capital.
NEUT26|For potential manufacturers say $150 million for each bona fide potential maker, companies could build a scale in a couple of months.
BEAR27|Thanks to needless regulatory rules, current tests take too long to get results or inconvenient for people to go to and take self administered.
NEUT28|Rapid tests would make people more responsible by empowering them, and it would stop the insidious approach taken by too many politicians and public health officials of sort of blaming people when cases rise, Congress must immediately fund this kind of fast, cheap and easily accessible testing now.
NEUT29|I'm Steve Forbes.
