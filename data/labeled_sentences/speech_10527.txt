NEUT0|"""Let's get to a mad dash."
NEUT1|Some not great news for Eli Lilly, no.
NEUT2|And I've got to tell you, David, I wish I had David Ricks on mad money not that long ago and felt pretty positive.
BULL3|Pretty pumped about the drug.
NEUT4|Frankly, this is an Alzheimer's drug and I think a lot of people felt the same way.
NEUT5|Which is why when they presented some data this weekend that was more mixed but still has some success.
NEUT6|Small sample.
NEUT7|250.
BEAR8|Lot of all that money is going to blow out.
NEUT9|Now.
NEUT10|I know from Biogen health difficult this drug.
NEUT11|This at this incredible illnesses J&J also told you repeatedly how difficult is I think that this is an overreaction.
NEUT12|My Chapel trust owns it.
BEAR13|Did I get too bullish on it?
BEAR14|I believe the management I think management got too bullish and he like Louisa very conservative company.
NEUT15|So I question whether people are they got.
NEUT16|Let's say that Lewis did over promise or Lily promised an what you got is something that I think a lot of people would still take.
NEUT17|Which is that maybe?
NEUT18|Ultimately, maybe get three years if everything works great without getting Alzheimer's versus others.
NEUT19|But David, when you see this disease and there's any hope, everyone just wants to own a stock that's associated with it, and the consensus was that there won't be any accelerated approval by the FDA 'cause they don't, they will not like the data enough, right?
BULL20|And that's what's driving time, you know, Jim, in a year, of course, where we've seen what incredible success the Pharmaceutical industry can have in terms of fighting a disease.
NEUT21|And even things that we haven't talked about is often in terms of the advances that continue to be made against cancer.
NEUT22|You start to think oh, they're going to be able to do it.
BULL23|They're going to be able to tackle Alzheimer's, and yet so far no, no.
NEUT24|When you look there is a definite reversion of plaque which at one point we would have felt.
NEUT25|I remember in the Old Forest labs and an named an an ATA.
BEAR26|They had this truck and then the and the fact that I can't even remember to pronounce it just tells you exactly how worthless it may have been for some people.
NEUT27|But there is a notion that if you can get rid of plaque, that may be good things can happen.
NEUT28|And now there's a belief that maybe that even worked well, that's the question.
NEUT29|It's still there, still not.
NEUT30|They're not completely.
NEUT31|Certain that that's really what causes it right now, though, it's the underlying causation which they're still trying to understand fully.
NEUT32|For Alzheimer's, there's so much going on there, but David, you're so right, I think that there was a belief that with warp speed, and what's happened, bring it on, bring home, whatever illness there is, it's going to be defeated, and that's just not the case.
