BULL0|"""Thanks for watching this quick video."
NEUT1|It's not on Snapchat stock, so the idea or Snapchat is that be mainly based on this girl.
BULL2|Good results that happen yesterday on on the earnings.
NEUT3|The stock just jumped up.
NEUT4|The point is that where are we right now with this talk, the best option to me or mainly based on technical analysis is really just toward the cause.
BULL5|OK, it's going up agree with that, but you know there are no enough signal to support these rarely.
NEUT6|So actually the only signal that I can see is that once the target price will reach 45 U.S. dollars, he can jump down again.
NEUT7|235 U.S. dollar and the idea is just wait for now waited.
BEAR8|This price will go down again to up to 35 U.S. dollar.
NEUT9|And if this 35 U.S. dollar will work as.
NEUT10|Support the idea is to go longer.
NEUT11|Following these bullish trend.
NEUT12|So again in front of us there is this one hour Candlestick showing the snapshot price movement and the idea as usual we would like to predict the next step of this talk and as we are right now, technical analysis too complicated for technical analysis to see that there are not enough signal.
NEUT13|Let's say signals to see that the pricing will keep going up.
NEUT14|So that's why.
NEUT15|Beast on and those information together available right now the idea is told because they price retracement might start soon before going up again.
NEUT16|Little bit upset the option that two options.
NEUT17|One option is that Prescott Ridge is 45 U.S. dollar and then jump down after Gate 35 U.S. dollar and then going up again.
NEUT18|So that's why this is woken up and now I don't know if the prices will will start going down right now or if the prices start going up right now.
NEUT19|But because of this because those two options are still valid and there are no signals to say which.
NEUT20|Which one of this option is will take the lead idea is just to hold for now or.
BULL21|"Snap chat thanks bye."""
