NEUT0|"""Paul, we've talked about Zoom before you went after it again."
NEUT1|Yeah, let's go to zoom zoom, huh?
NEUT2|Yeah, zoom, zoom, zoom zoom.
NEUT3|We're not using zoom right now, but let's get after it.
NEUT4|So Paul, we did it.
NEUT5|We did it.
BEAR6|We did a show on this many months ago and when it was completely spiking an look at this now it's dropped down a bit.
BEAR7|So guys I want to show you if I told you at this point that's right, the stock were going to fall 40%.
NEUT8|Would you have thought?
NEUT9|It's not possible, yeah.
NEUT10|Look at it.
BEAR11|It's down like 35% right now.
NEUT12|So I'm just telling you guys like these things happen.
BEAR13|This is only literally two months in 2 1/2 months ago, and it's down 3540% like you gotta just be patient.
NEUT14|Sometimes the great news is there's 10,000 stocks in the US for US based company is be patient and find 20 or 30 that fit your criteria and find 100 more that are just that you love that are just aren't selling at the right price.
NEUT15|That's it.
NEUT16|Let's get after Paul.
NEUT17|What is the market cap for?
NEUT18|Zoom baby $100 billion with a 246 PE?
BEAR19|That's a kind of a big accident.
BULL20|But profit margins huge 25% so we have an X on the PE.
BULL21|We wanted to be around 20, it's 246 so it's 12 times higher than it should be and we have a 25% profit margin.
BULL22|That's pretty good.
BULL23|Pretty good.
BULL24|OK, how about revenue growth over the past five years?
NEUT25|Is Pillar #3 Paul.
NEUT26|I'm quite sure this is going to be insane.
NEUT27|Yeah, so 60 million to 622,000,000.
NEUT28|Ten times more check mark?
NEUT29|How about profit growth?
NEUT30|Pillar #4?
BULL31|Recently break even to only profit of 25 million on $660 million there, but that will probably increase, so that doesn't include the shutdown.
NEUT32|Let's look at this, including the shutdown.
NEUT33|Wow, four and $27 million they made in the last nine months.
NEUT34|That's insane.
BULL35|That's awesome, good for them.
NEUT36|How about Pillar #5 pause?
NEUT37|There shares outstanding.
BEAR38|We want that going down baby it is going down 237,000,000 down to 233.
NEUT39|That's nice right great, OK?
BEAR40|Current assets over current liabilities poem.
BULL41|I imagine this is going to be good as well.
NEUT42|Uncle Seth, so current assets of 2.6 billion.
NEUT43|OK, why is this not there?
NEUT44|We go 2.6 billion current liabilities of 1.4 so check Mark there.
NEUT45|In fact, total liabilities of 1.55.
NEUT46|So quadruple check Mark there they have more cash on hand than liabilities and and I usually subtract this number.
NEUT47|It's about $900 million from the market capital markets 100 billion.
NEUT48|So it doesn't really matter.
NEUT49|It's only 1% difference.
BEAR50|This company is still massively overpriced.
NEUT51|Should we keep going with the stock pool?
NEUT52|I mean, it's no.
NEUT53|Let's just sit there and say guys umaima know on for awhile.
NEUT54|What price I don't know a lot lower like a lot, lot lower.
NEUT55|I mean it would be.
NEUT56|I mean maybe maybe 10 billion 90% drop or something.
NEUT57|I don't know.
BEAR58|"It's really bad."""
