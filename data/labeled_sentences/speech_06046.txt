NEUT0|"""Wow, it's tough like taking a pause this morning."
BULL1|Still up, what just about doubled from its IPO price.
NEUT2|This company argues it's got a new way to deal with data in the cloud era, making it easier to store, move, analyze, even securely.
NEUT3|Share, and they argue that that's a huge idea.
NEUT4|Snowflake represents kind of a paradigm shift in the tech IPO market from where I sit.
NEUT5|Here's what CEO Frank Slootman said about the IPO process yesterday when I spoke with him.
NEUT6|Just after the stock started trading.
NEUT7|The IPO is really not the highlight of my life.
NEUT8|You know, it's it's.
BULL9|It's a milestone.
NEUT10|We're here to build our business to build our product.
NEUT11|That's that's what we're excited about.
NEUT12|That's what we do.
NEUT13|I asked him about that path to profitability that we always tend to ask about it.
NEUT14|I had IPO time.
BEAR15|Clearly they're not profitable there.
NEUT16|Spending all of revenue and maybe a little more than that on sales and marketing.
NEUT17|But but suit and says this is not a growth at all costs approach that he's taken.
BULL18|He is being disciplined with the money.
NEUT19|No profits anytime soon either.
NEUT20|So in a way, though, this story is driven by product scale and market opportunity and it seems to me David.
NEUT21|Like just a few months ago, the argument was kind of post Huber that the market moved away from that, but we want to see profits.
NEUT22|Well, you know scale this time, not profits.
NEUT23|It's going to be awhile, right?
NEUT24|I mean to your point now.
BULL25|I mean, it's a great growth company.
NEUT26|As Jim said this morning.
NEUT27|Whether or not it's worth 100 years worth of its current revenues.
NEUT28|Maybe not.
NEUT29|Well, I mean at the rate at which it's growing, and if you can argue that the executives have this currency now, they can do acquisitions.
NEUT30|Maybe their vision is a lot bigger on me and I'm sure you know.
NEUT31|25 years ago people were saying selling books online really is, that is that a huge idea.
NEUT32|I guess the argument might be if this is the next mega scale cloud player.
NEUT33|I mean, who knows how long that takes?
NEUT34|Just you know, John.
NEUT35|One quick final question, what did they?
NEUT36|In other words, doing analytics data analytics in the cloud and connecting?
NEUT37|What is it?
NEUT38|What's their secret sauce versus anybody else that's trying to do that?
NEUT39|Well, I'm not technical enough to be able to give you a great answer on that David.
NEUT40|They do have nearly a third of the Fortune 500 as customers right now, and the argument that they make is that even others like Microsoft and Amazon that are trying to convince compete with them.
NEUT41|With Azure with redshift or kind of bolting on, they're not as fluid in their ability to deal with the data and even allow different customers.
NEUT42|To share access to data when it's necessary and practicable, and if they're right about that, then you know there's an argument to be made that there's some profit is.
BEAR43|Yeah well, if you're not completely conversant in it, only imagine how bad it is for the rest of us.
BULL44|"Thank you, John."""
