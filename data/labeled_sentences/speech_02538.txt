NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, in this video we're going to talk about a very important pattern that is forming on the Doge coin chart."
NEUT1|Will go over that.
NEUT2|Also, I want to talk about a few news articles, so let's get right into it.
NEUT3|Just remember, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT4|This is not financial advice, so the two news articles that I wanted to go over or basically just point out because they're both bullish for Doge coin, is Dogecoins.
NEUT5|Moon shot is proof that Elon Musk runs the universe now, and this just talks about how much of an influence that Elon has over doge coin so, but.
NEUT6|It's very bullish for people to see these articles, so I just wanted to point it out.
BULL7|It's really good to see these, and there was one more with those coin shows, no sign of slowing as the endorsements keep piling up.
NEUT8|So this just talks about how a lot of celebrities are jumping on board for doge coin and talking about it and pumping up the price.
NEUT9|It also talks about one of the things that is going for Doge coin which a lot of people think that this is not one of the things that is good for Doge coin is that it's inflationary rather than deflationary.
NEUT10|A lot of people think that's not a good thing, but this article is pointing out and saying that it relates more to real world currencies when it's inflationary.
NEUT11|So that's just something to point out.
NEUT12|Very interesting, and it just goes on to talk about if major major financial institutions start warming up to, you know, doge coin, like they are two other cryptocurrencies that then we could see major major spikes in Doge coin price.
NEUT13|So very very interesting articles.
NEUT14|Just wanted to point out very bullish for Doge coin.
NEUT15|Let's take a look at the chart.
NEUT16|This bullish pattern that I see forming is on the four hour chart an this is the four hour time frame we're looking at right now.
NEUT17|I think it was about a week ago.
NEUT18|I had pointed this out on a previous video, but we had a little small Cup and handle forming here.
NEUT19|We had the consolidation period and then the pump.
NEUT20|So what I'm seeing actually happen right now in the volume is actually correlated with the corresponding with the Cup forming is that we do have the Cup forming here.
BULL21|And now if we have the small handle form consolidation period and then maybe we work our way up towards these 7 cent range region, whatever you want to call it.
BULL22|But yeah, I think that we're going to work our way up to that 7 cent region very soon.
BULL23|It seems like we're on track for it.
BULL24|Also, we do have a nice ascending trend line of support occurring here.
NEUT25|So very, very interesting right now.
NEUT26|I like to see this.
BULL27|I think the chart looks nice and bullish.
NEUT28|We have a nice setup for another Cup and handle forming here.
