NEUT0|"""You could argue these tech companies are so powerful because they know how to invent and then re invent and reinvent."
NEUT1|Again.
BULL2|Yes, in some cases copy their competitors and come out on top.
BEAR3|If they come up with something better, you could argue that their scale gives them a huge unfair advantage from a stocking perspective.
NEUT4|It's the same thing.
NEUT5|Most of all, they've proven that they'll never let a crisis go to waste.
NEUT6|Listen to these spectacular numbers.
NEUT7|Amazon made nearly 89 billion in revenue.
NEUT8|St was looking for 81.5 billion.
NEUT9|That's how you translate into a gargantuan $10.30 of earnings per share.
NEUT10|And we're looking for Buck 46 and they weren't even trying to have an incredibly profitable quarter.
BULL11|They spend aggressively to build capacity for the stay at home economy and to keep their employees safe.
NEUT12|Billions of dollars from that.
NEUT13|As for the next quarter, Amazon Gabe Law forecast stock so far, right?
NEUT14|How about Apple, right?
NEUT15|This is another blockbuster set of numbers.
NEUT16|They did 59.7 billion in revenue, but you're looking for about 5051, seven, 7.5 billion more than expected.
BULL17|They did, along with 51 cent earnings, beat off the $2.07 space, the largest company in the world.
NEUT18|People, iPhones, iPads, Macs, the service revenue stream.
BULL19|Accessories all stronger than expected.
BEAR20|iPhone numbers were truly magnificent people worried that they wouldn't sell this quarter because of the lock down.
NEUT21|Instead, they did 26 billion in sales Walters looking for 22 PM.
NEUT22|And while Apple didn't give us a forecast for the next quarter, they did give us something that I know is truly regarded as leisure demand by some people.
NEUT23|Let's just say, but I think is important.
BULL24|They gave us a four for one stock split, which should make this one a lot more enticing to home gamers who might be scared away from a $4 price plus price target.
NEUT25|Many other copies should actually watch with Tim Cook.
NEUT26|Does here and stop watching.
NEUT27|Warren Buffett does do what Tim Cook does.
NEUT28|It's another reason why Apple zooming after hours.
NEUT29|You know me, I haven't changed my mantra.
NEUT30|I say Apple own it.
NEUT31|Don't trade it.
NEUT32|If that's like my middle name these days, OK, I want to trade is my middle name Facebook after all the Sturm and Drang about major advertisers boycotting the platform.
BULL33|Facebook shot the lights out as they told you that they would big revenue beat with sales up 11% year over year and Norma's 41 cent earnings beat off $1.39 basis daily.
BULL34|Average users of 12% that is stunning.
BULL35|Even better July is going strong.
NEUT36|Millions of small businesses need Facebook.
BULL37|Instagram shops is a gigantic hit.
NEUT38|This is a small and medium sized business juggernaut.
NEUT39|Now one of the stocks flying in after hours trading.
NEUT40|They make a lot.
NEUT41|They create a lot more companies.
NEUT42|That's more than the SP eight US album.
NEUT43|It's more tricky.
BULL44|Numbers were substantially better expected as their core advertising business took a major hit.
BULL45|Still, YouTube managed to grow by 6%.
BEAR46|The phenomenal Google Cloud that was that Thomas Curry and I told you bout up 43% stock barely budged response.
NEUT47|But I think that's because alphabets management is so non promotional.
BEAR48|No they're worse.
NEUT49|They are anti promotional.
NEUT50|They should go work at Moderna.
BEAR51|Put it all together and three of the four companies that Congress grilled yesterday just reported unambiguously fabulous quarters that have sent their stocks in the stratosphere.
BULL52|The 4th point did pretty darn well, even if its stock only rallied a little.
NEUT53|If I were out there on the conference call, believe me, I would be a little more, let's say aggressive talk about an incredible track record.
