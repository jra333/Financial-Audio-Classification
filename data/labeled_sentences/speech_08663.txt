BULL0|"""Welcome back to bubble trading everyone."
NEUT1|Today we're in this video we're going to be talking about Currency Works, Inc. Ticker symbol C WRK today.
BULL2|It had an amazing day after Jerome Powell in the Fed's announced bullish sentiment in the markets went up 43 1/2 percent, hitting $3.46.
NEUT3|Just perfection really.
NEUT4|I like this one.
NEUT5|It's a current.
NEUT6|It's a company that helps different companies create their own blockchains to engage with their audiences and their customers to make it more fun for them and in and just make an all around great experience.
NEUT7|They are an OTC QB, verified there in the venture index, so I'd like to see that they are based out of Los Angeles, CA.
NEUT8|They have a shares outstanding at 48 million which is amazing.
NEUT9|Market cap right now is around $115 million.
BULL10|So that's great to see, but I think actually it went up 43 and so that's actually more around $200 million.
NEUT11|But a lot of attention around it.
NEUT12|Lots of people on Twitter talking about it, ultimately.
NEUT13|Again, they get news about every two weeks or so against news.
NEUT14|They helped her.
NEUT15|Kodak created come create a ticker and they're starting to help other companies as well as helping create some entity related stuff for different companies.
BEAR16|You can see that it was around in that base for around 50 to $0.60 for awhile consolidated their broke out came back down.
BULL17|And then Boom, had a great shot there.
BEAR18|And then ultimately, there was that little market correction, so it went down some.
NEUT19|And today just have beautiful count candle and tons of volume, tons of attention.
NEUT20|Just everything you want to see.
NEUT21|I'll go to a smaller time frame and see in show.
BULL22|Yeah, so we broke above all those resistances.
NEUT23|All time.
NEUT24|Yeah, I mean we're in price discovery mode right now, so the Sky is the limit with that share.
NEUT25|$10 is definitely possible that be around eight $500 million market valuation.
NEUT26|We're seeing a lot of other blockchain related stocks such as sand P, such as anything like Riot Mara, Hive Hut 8.
BEAR27|All that are breaking that billion dollar mark pretty much in market cap.
NEUT28|So this could definitely get up there, so I wouldn't even be surprised that this had $10.
NEUT29|That's when I be looking for in the medium term here.
NEUT30|Ultimately, anything else you want us to cover, go ahead and post in the comments any questions you have, post there.
NEUT31|And of course, we're going to just keep making videos like this.
NEUT32|Updates show you the company, the product, the team, and overall the chart and where we see some resistance and supports to find great stocks like this like we've been talking about this one for awhile since he was under a dollar and now it's breaking out in this in price coveri mode.
NEUT33|So we'll do our best to keep bringing these to the community and ultimately everything that we say here is just our opinions.
NEUT34|It is not financial advice.
NEUT35|We are not financial advisors.
NEUT36|"Any investing to contact a certified financial advisor."""
