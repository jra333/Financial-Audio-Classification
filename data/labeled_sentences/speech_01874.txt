BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about cases today.
NEUT2|So what cases does is they make really good pizza in there.
NEUT3|Mostly gas station though.
NEUT4|Current price $194.94 which gives the market cap of $6.8 billion.
NEUT5|Dividend yield is 1.36% with a payout ratio of 15%.
NEUT6|It's actually 14.51, but you know really good start right there.
NEUT7|Revenue $8.1 billion earnings $264 million, which gives them a PE of 20 with a forward PE of 23.
BEAR8|Obviously forward PE being hired kind of a problem, but 23 is not terrible.
BEAR9|Also revenue shrinking that much is kind of problem.
BEAR10|Fairly big problem.
NEUT11|Total assets $3.9 billion and total liabilities $2.3 billion, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $1.6 billion and.
BULL12|Obviously, good thing that it's going up.
BULL13|Good thing the liabilities are staying the same.
BULL14|Decent balance sheet.
BULL15|Not not good balance sheet, but.
BULL16|Compared to the market cap, definitely pretty pretty nice.
NEUT17|So risk factors.
NEUT18|Obviously electric cars are kind of a risk factor for a company that mostly deals in gas stations that will obviously not come quickly, but.
NEUT19|If things progress the way that I think they will, gas stations are going to be mostly obsolete within the next decade or so.
NEUT20|And Warren Buffett kind of things that if you don't want to hold a stock for 10 years, you shouldn't hold it for 10 minutes.
NEUT21|And I tend to agree with that.
NEUT22|So with the current progression of electric vehicles, there will be quite a few still left on the roads in 20-30 and beyond.
NEUT23|Maybe 2050 ish when the last old gas cars will be sent to the dump.
NEUT24|Anyway, I really don't like it when the business model is slowly eroding, and so I'm definitely not going to invest in this.
BULL25|Overall, this stats do look pretty nice though.
BEAR26|Obviously for a growth investor, negative growth is a huge problem, so nothing to see here.
BULL27|For a dividend investor though, dividend yield of 1.36% with a payload ratio of 15% is pretty nice.
BULL28|Obviously fairly low dividend yield, but the payout ratio is really nice.
NEUT29|Overall, considering what you can currently get for government bonds, 1.36% is definitely not bad, so I don't know.
BULL30|Probably better opportunities out there, but.
NEUT31|Definitely not.
NEUT32|In the current state about stock for value, investor P is nice.
BULL33|Balance sheet is pretty nice.
BEAR34|In the early growing with shrinking revenue also not bad.
BEAR35|Their revenue shrinking obviously also problem and the dividend being a nice bonus definitely looks interesting.
NEUT36|So if you have a decent long term view of Casey's and maybe gas cars in general, then I think this would be an interesting start to look into.
NEUT37|I just don't share that view at all.
NEUT38|That's it for me.
NEUT39|For today.
