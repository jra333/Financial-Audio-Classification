NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today."
NEUT1|I'm going to be talking about the stock via Combs Inc, which is VIAC and just kind of giving some of my thoughts on this one 'cause I know it has a lot of popularity on Twitter.
NEUT2|Full disclosure, I do have a small position in this one and I just kind of want to detail what I'm looking at, so normally I always talk about playing big breakout charts, but with this one was such a heavy pull back.
NEUT3|The last you know, 6-7 trading days.
NEUT4|I just kind of want to outline what I'm personally looking for on a stock like this.
NEUT5|So for me this is a trade that's all about risk to reward and I kind of just want to explain what I'm looking at.
NEUT6|So as you can see after this big pullback I just took a position last Thursday and the reason I did so because this one is starting to form a base in some consolidation.
BEAR7|The dips have kind of stopped for now, so for me personally the risk at this point honestly would be like a break in closed below like that 43.
NEUT8|50 kind of scent range maybe a little bit lower, maybe like 43 forty 4330 the break to the upside that I'm going to be looking for at this point is like that.
NEUT9|$48.00 Mark for this one.
NEUT10|Does Turner really bullish?
NEUT11|Again?
NEUT12|I think a break of like 47 could potentially send this to like the mid 48 and then once that starts to crack you know I could see 50 plus definitely happening.
NEUT13|So I mean with about $1.00 risk in a potentially like 5 plus dollars of reward.
NEUT14|That is something I'd be looking at since this one is starting to form this, like sideways consolidation kind of channel.
NEUT15|For me this one's all about, you know, managing emotions and having the ability to outline a detailed plan and being able to stick to it.
NEUT16|'cause I think that's going to be the most important thing on this one.
NEUT17|And again, if you look at the four hour chart you can see very clearly where some of your risk levels might be, and you can also see what needs to happen for this one to kind of start to get a little bit more bullish.
NEUT18|Especially on like a four hour time frame.
NEUT19|I don't see any reason why it this one can't start to curl back up.
NEUT20|This can't go $50 plus but I just kind of wanted to outline something different when you talk about breakout charts.
NEUT21|That's how I play something like this.
NEUT22|'cause I mean a break of this like 47 and then like 4840 Mark could send this to 50 plus potentially.
NEUT23|You know if they can really start to curl.
NEUT24|I mean there's no reason why this one can't break 50 and potentially test like $5455 in the shorter term.
NEUT25|And again with such a small risk being right around like that 43 forty 4350 mark anytime.
NEUT26|I personally can see a 5 + 5 or 6 to one or more risk to reward.
NEUT27|That is something I'm always.
NEUT28|Interested in playing.
NEUT29|So that's just kind of my thoughts on this one, so I'm not sure if any of you guys are playing it.
NEUT30|If you are, go ahead and leave a comment down below and let me know what you think.
NEUT31|As always, I'm not a financial advisor.
