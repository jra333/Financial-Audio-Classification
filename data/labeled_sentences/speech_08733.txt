NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this weird video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very nice day on this one.
BEAR5|Price gapped up and then just continue to grind higher and higher which is now putting it within striking distance of some very interesting levels and that first level that it's within striking distance of that is a very very interesting level and I'm emphasizing very interesting because I don't want to come across like this.
NEUT6|$117.00 mark.
NEUT7|Here are some great discovery on my part or anything like that.
NEUT8|Actually the exact opposite.
NEUT9|I assure you people that use charts and understand charts have taken notice of 117 are going to be watching that level very closely.
NEUT10|And I emphasize all that because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing.
NEUT11|Call yourself a filling prophecy cover if you want.
BULL12|It can produce some very dynamic movements, so while nothing is guaranteed, my point is that if the price continues to work its way up to that level and can get a break of 117, that could very well create quite a bit of upside buying pressure.
NEUT13|Again, not guaranteed to happen, but a more than rational and valid thought to be having so more of the story.
NEUT14|117 definitely a very important technical level to watch moving forward as far as levels of support and concern.
NEUT15|Key levels to watch now going to be right here at that breakout point around the one 1525 Mark and this is just the classic example within the world title charge, which states when levels of resistance, which very clearly was right, there are broken and it was broken right there.
NEUT16|You want to see them access support and check out where that pullback bonds from right at that level.
NEUT17|So I mean you could throw this into a textbook if you wanted to and absolutely like I said, classic example of resistance now behaving as support.
NEUT18|So one 1525 is going to be another level that a lot of people will be watching.
NEUT19|Same philosophy if the price comes down here.
NEUT20|And breaks down through it.
NEUT21|Guaranteed no.
NEUT22|But is it rational?
BEAR23|Think that a break could create some downward selling pressure?
NEUT24|Absolutely.
NEUT25|So keep a close eye on that.
NEUT26|But All in all, those would be the two main levels to watch moving forward.
NEUT27|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL31|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT37|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live.
NEUT40|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT41|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
