NEUT0|"""How do you synthesize a boom economy into global allocation?"
NEUT1|And for that matter, just trying to get to next Monday, how do you synthesize it?
NEUT2|I'm going to take Hatzius over at Goldman Sachs going out to a stunning 10% plus statistic for Q2 growth.
NEUT3|You and I have never seen this Rosenberg out of Carnegie Mellon all the years.
NEUT4|He studied a temper.
NEUT5|Guess what?
NEUT6|He's never seen this.
NEUT7|How do you frame your work in a boom, will you?
NEUT8|Like I think this is exactly the right question.
NEUT9|Probably the most important because as you've said, very few living investors have ever seen this to me means a couple of things.
NEUT10|One you were alluding to before the break, which is that rates are going to continue to normalize.
NEUT11|It doesn't mean that they melt up forever, but it is very hard.
NEUT12|I think Tom you nailed this before to reconcile negative 60 bips real 10 year yield.
BULL13|An economy that may grow 7-8, nine, 10% in the back half of the year.
NEUT14|One of those two things is wrong.
BULL15|We think rates continue to normalize.
NEUT16|The other is a lot of investors were used to thinking only in terms of beta.
NEUT17|What's your market exposure?
NEUT18|I think if you're going to have an economy that's growing that fast, you also have to think in terms of your cyclical exposure.
NEUT19|There are going to be parts of this economy companies that they're going to see demand they've not seen in decades.
NEUT20|Can you deliver those themes?
NEUT21|Can you take advantage of that very fundamental change in your portfolio?
NEUT22|Those are two things were.
BEAR23|Focusing on our duration is the lowest it's been in years, and we're looking for ways to add cyclical exposure back into the portfolio.
NEUT24|I know you're speaking metaphorically, Rusty said.
NEUT25|How can we leverage those cyclical themes in order to add exposure in your portfolio?
NEUT26|There are people, however, who are taking this quite literally as we have learned, and they're leveraging up some of their positions.
BULL27|Yes, rates are normalizing, but there is a belief in the Fed is adding to this that they're sitting on the front end.
NEUT28|As we do see some push toward normalization, are there more?
NEUT29|Accidents waiting to happen, like what we just saw.
NEUT30|Well, I think whenever you see an abrupt move there always going to be blowups there.
NEUT31|Going to be people that are overextended.
BULL32|You know you've had a very strong bull market.
NEUT33|There's going to be concentration.
NEUT34|The thing that I would watch is actually the rapidity of the move.
NEUT35|You know we know this.
BULL36|We've seen that stocks and rates can move up together.
NEUT37|Matter of fact, if you look at equities equity multiples in real rates, they tend to move up together for the obvious reason that as the economy gets better and companies gain operating leverage.
BULL38|Earnings go up.
NEUT39|What can trip up the market is the rapidity and more specifically the spike in bond market volatility.
NEUT40|If you look at what's been happening the last three or four months bond volatility is been increasingly moving with stock volatility.
NEUT41|That's where I think the danger is.
BEAR42|"If we get these days, these weeks were yields back up this quickly that unnerves investors and that's when you tend to see some of these blowups."""
