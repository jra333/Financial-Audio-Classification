NEUT0|"""Also guys should boy well today we're talking about GameStop stock ticker symbol G ME."
NEUT1|I'll give you my GameStop, stock analysts and predictions and also just a little level that I see if it hits this level at $45.00 and 43 I will buy.
NEUT2|I'll buy some shares.
NEUT3|Maybe like.
BEAR4|Maybe 30 to 50 shares of GME at this level, 'cause I think it will have some pop up off the level.
NEUT5|Let's look at the after hours.
NEUT6|So it's kind of stable after hours.
NEUT7|It is getting close to that level and I do want to buy off their level because I think it could be some buying pressure, but just look at this chart.
NEUT8|This chart just looks very nasty, they just they just took advantage and they just controlled everything to bring it right back down where they want it to be.
BULL9|But I went a little.
NEUT10|Guys were making money, they just killed everybody's accounts.
NEUT11|So hopefully when you guys were initially you guys took some type of profit and you guys are just holding your extra making it a free play OK?
NEUT12|I do talk about a strategy how to make your play free.
NEUT13|So much stuff like this happens.
NEUT14|You already major profit on this area on this side of the curve and now you just hold it and it really.
NEUT15|So how I'm playing this is I'll probably buy off this level.
NEUT16|I won't go in on my full what I expect to put so the full amount that I expect to put is maybe like 4 grand at this level, but when it hits this level are probably put in like 1 grand.
NEUT17|And then I'll see how I react to see if it starts.
BEAR18|If it's starting to want to make some up movement 'cause it is very oversold.
NEUT19|So I'll be looking for that movement and once I start seeing it then I'll put the rest of the three going on and then I will try to hold it for a 20 percent, 20% return.
NEUT20|So from like 53.
BULL21|To about 66 or 20% return, so hopefully I can see that move tomorrow, but if I don't then that's fine.
NEUT22|Like I said, you only put money here that you're willing to lose, so just make it easier on your mind too, as you're watching the play.
BEAR23|But on game stock stock they kind of just murdered all this and now I think people are losing the hype on the play as well.
BEAR24|I know some people are still at their holding.
NEUT25|So right now I'm just really watching this level and that is only really key level that I see.
NEUT26|We do.
NEUT27|I do want to see GameStop start pushing up a little bit, but we just really just have to wait to see how Harry X in this level and what it does on this level will tell me a lot about the stock.
NEUT28|OK, so I'll make another day tomorrow once I see this level hit and I'll let you guys know what I see.
NEUT29|"So remember another recommendation bar so anything is for educational purposes only so do not trade anything you see in these videos and I'll catch you guys in there."""
