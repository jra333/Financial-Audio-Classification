BULL0|"""RP is currently going up."
NEUT1|This is nothing folks you have not seen anything yet.
NEUT2|SRP should be standard.
NEUT3|A $1.00 plus coin that just makes sense if you know the capability of Ripple, an SRP and what they've done with that coin.
NEUT4|It should easily just be chilling at $1.20.
NEUT5|Kind of like where Cardano Zella dollar $20.50 easily so we haven't seen nothing yet.
NEUT6|Hopefully we get a new standard price for XRP so that whenever you log on to Coinmarketcap you just see.
NEUT7|Oh yeah, that's SRP.
NEUT8|It's like a $1.00 point.
NEUT9|"Oh yeah, like that type of ****."""
