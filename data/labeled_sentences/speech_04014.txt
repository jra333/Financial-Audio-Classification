NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|I'm like I'm stocked up in this video.
NEUT2|Wouldn't be going over the Friday pop series in in this video.
BEAR3|It is one of the craziest Friday pop series to date.
BULL4|The opportunity today could have turned $2.00 into $601.00 in one day.
NEUT5|This is probably the biggest Friday pop series ever, all right now.
NEUT6|What happened is the reason the opportunity was so great was because.
BULL7|Disney spiked 12% today so that you know almost never happens.
BULL8|You never have huge socks spike 12% in one day, but today it did.
NEUT9|In this how you could have turned $2.00 into $601.00 in one day.
NEUT10|So we're going to go over, you know.
NEUT11|Obviously you can see Disney popped right, went from, you know, $116.60 to 130.
BEAR12|It pretty much $131 in one day.
NEUT13|Why did that happen?
NEUT14|News came out that they are releasing their streaming service, so we're going to go over.
NEUT15|So first I want to send this and you could just Scroll down and then you can see all the news articles.
NEUT16|I am on Yahoo Finance but I'm not highlight a few major things from the article.
NEUT17|So the first thing that they're competing with Netflix alright and then it is only in class $7.00.
BULL18|So Netflix recently raised their prices and Disney is pricing under them so as to be great for Disney and then also so they said it's going to launch on November 12.
NEUT19|In major global markets, let's see some major.
NEUT20|Let's see major.
NEUT21|Major programs which is great, and then you know they're pursuing a very aggressive strategy and they're aiming for 60 to 90 million subscribers, so that's a lot.
NEUT22|And they're also putting a billion dollars in cash, so you know, just.
NEUT23|You know it's a big move for the company and its great long term like even some big investors said.
BULL24|You know they need to be very very successful and that is great for the company.
BULL25|And that's why Disney Spike 12% today.
NEUT26|So how could we have turned it $2.00 into $601.00 in one day?
NEUT27|Yesterday, Disney closed at $116.60.
BEAR28|The 125 strike calls yesterday only costs $2.00, but today they hit highs of $601.00.
BULL29|They opened at 400 and then still ran up to 601.
NEUT30|So even if you bought it open you could have got about a 50% return, which is great, but you know it's just a crazy crazy play that option option present, you know, literally the option spiked 27,450% in one day.
NEUT31|So it's absolutely insane.
NEUT32|Now it would have been very hard to predict this, but like I said, you could have bought it open even like further out of the money like 130 calls could have bought it to open and then like dip Bottom.
NEUT33|So if we go to a one minute chart, let's see so you know opens up at $300 dips down around here sitting at $100 and retest back up and goes all the way up to 200.
NEUT34|So that's an easy double.
NEUT35|There's a lot of ways you could have played it, but you know, it's strictly strictly gambolling Friday options.
NEUT36|So if you have any questions on this video, let me know in the comments down below.
BULL37|"But other than that, thanks for watching."""
