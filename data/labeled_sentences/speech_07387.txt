BULL0|"""Good evening folks."
NEUT1|Today is December 24th, 2020.
NEUT2|The time is.
NEUT3|6:19 PM Ann I'm what I want to talk to you today about is My Portfolio, so I'm just going to give you an update.
BEAR4|We have Best Buy with 54 shares so we did cut down on some of our shares.
NEUT5|We sold 1/2 hour shares for a small profit just under 5%.
BULL6|So I was kind of happy about that.
NEUT7|We're we're still sitting at around the same price we bought it at next is Facebook.
BEAR8|We did add to Facebook about 267, so that brought down our price per share down to two 6950.
BEAR9|But overall we are still down on Facebook.
NEUT10|Alright, so that is the update for the portfolio.
NEUT11|I will be adding new positions come Monday because it is holiday season.
NEUT12|Markets tend to be very volatile during this time, so I don't want to be adding too many positions, but I'll be looking into adding more positions during the new year.
NEUT13|I did do some day trading throughout the last couple of days while I wasn't video videoing or uploading on my YouTube.
NEUT14|So if you have any questions about what day trading is, this is currently with.
NEUT15|This is swing trading.
NEUT16|So what we're doing here is not really day trading but more sweet trading.
NEUT17|But if you have any questions about day trading, feel free to leave a question in the comments or you can DM me or email me at aistockalerts@gmail.com.
BULL18|"Alright, thank you so much for watching and have yourself a great day."""
