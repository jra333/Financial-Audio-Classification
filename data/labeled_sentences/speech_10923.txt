BULL0|"""Going on guys just got over a rain storm here in Florida, but I got a new stock here and be RV is the ticker symbol."
BULL1|The stock is looking very good in the chart setups.
BEAR2|Even better, our size just about oversold.
NEUT3|So this talk is going to get ready to run.
NEUT4|Yeah, look at this, I'm getting ready to move out of the house.
NEUT5|That's not fun now and just a reminder, I'm not a sacrifice.
NEUT6|We got some you asking questions about.
NEUT7|Hey, you know when should I sell in all that listen I'm just giving you a stock to give you a set up on a swing trade and then it's all on you.
NEUT8|You can decide if you want to make your losses or you want to make your profits so on you.
NEUT9|And I just remind you to subscribe to my channel and like this video.
NEUT10|If you guys enjoyed it, let's get right into it.
NEUT11|So the stock option for the stock is actually going to expire on April 18th.
NEUT12|That is this Thursday and they got that at $2.50.
BEAR13|So this is actually going to drag the stack down to pretty much where we wanted for our swing trade.
NEUT14|Alright, so this is a little bit about the company right here.
NEUT15|Nabriva if I'm even close to saying that right, but they basically have a leading product that's being developed right now, and I'm not going to even try to say any of these words right here, 'cause I have no idea what they are.
NEUT16|So I hate doing drug company stocks.
BULL17|So we got support here around two 5245 and we got resistance up here at about 327.
NEUT18|So this is the channel that I'm actually looking to get into right here.
BEAR19|So if you look at the RSI real quick every time it's been oversold, it has recovered and the last two times it's been oversold.
BULL20|It's actually recovered pretty good and got over the overbought area, so I'm actually looking to get in here around 2:43 and then I'm going to be looking to get out of it right around 327, so that's going to be about 31% swing trade and you can see the RSI is almost at the overall area.
BEAR21|Yeah so with the options expiring on Thursday I think the stocks gonna drive down to where we wanted to right around 2:00.
NEUT22|45 to 47.
NEUT23|I even think 250 is going to be a pretty good number to get in at.
NEUT24|So just like to remind you to subscribe to my channel.
