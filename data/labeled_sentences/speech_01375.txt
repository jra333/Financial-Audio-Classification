BEAR0|"""3D was supposed to save the movie industry, but US attendance fell almost 10% in 2010 and ticket receipts were down as well."
BULL1|Disney had some 3D hits with Toy Story 3 and Alice in Wonderland, but Tron Legacy hasn't lived up to its massive billing, so that was 2011 going to stack up for Disney.
NEUT2|Shareholders were asking a Bloomberg best analyst on Media David Bank.
NEUT3|He's with us from RBC Capital Markets offices here in New York City.
BULL4|David Studios for Disney bounced back and fiscal 2010 from a dismal 2009.
BEAR5|But what does this disappointing start for Tron going to mean for Q1, which ended just last month and Q2 were in it right now?
NEUT6|And Tron still in theaters?
NEUT7|Yeah, you know, you know, I think at the end of the day, these companies are so driven by their cable operations that the studio operations themselves.
NEUT8|Even when you have a big miss like this, probably isn't going to be that much of a needle mover.
NEUT9|You know what?
NEUT10|What I think we're going to have to wait and see is how many you know how many Tron lunch boxes and things like that got sold.
BULL11|And the chatter is actually OK. On that stuff.
NEUT12|So so we have to see what the blend between consumer products and the studios are, but I don't think this is going to hurt him too much is.
NEUT13|I think we would have liked to have seen them create a new franchise, though that would have been very helpful is the the story.
NEUT14|In the upside the same as the story?
NEUT15|On the downside?
NEUT16|Which is to say limited on both fronts or when cars 2 comes out later this year and we get Pirates of the Caribbean, 4 might.
NEUT17|Actually you know Goose Disney revenue and thus the stock a little bit more than.
NEUT18|Yeah, well, I think at the very least you know it represents a catalyst and that's what you look for in any of these stocks.
NEUT19|They're basically no business.
BULL20|Trends are basically good for all of them across the board.
BULL21|We feel really good about advertising and now we feel generally pretty good about the even the studio business.
NEUT22|You need that catalyst and these are huge movies both from a movie perspective and a consumer product perspective.
NEUT23|So I think those are the events you're waiting for.
NEUT24|How much upside do they represent?
NEUT25|You know, I think the stock is trading relatively cheap right now, so it's not like you need that much upside relative to its historical mult.
BULL26|Apples at trading cheap, but this is no reason usually a reason to get into the stock, but this is OK, so there are reasons to get into the stock even after a run of almost 17% last year.
NEUT27|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT28|Absolutely let's talk a bit about cable because you said that for these stocks like Disney, you know they really trade on what's going on in the cable business, particularly is penalised.
NEUT29|Let's call it, you know, networks.
NEUT30|They've got ESPN, they've got NBC.
NEUT31|How are the prospects for that business heading into 2011?
BULL32|They seem pretty strong with advertising robust coming out of 2010.
NEUT33|Yeah, I mean look, there's there's two forces at work.
NEUT34|One is advertising and the others affiliate fees.
NEUT35|Affiliate fees are contractually driven.
NEUT36|You know, an advertising trends are pretty readable right now is being strong, so you know with 60% of the IOI coming from that business, very little comes from ABC.
NEUT37|It's really more the cable networks.
BULL38|You know, it's it's the trends are very strong.
NEUT39|I think in the long term and we've talked about it.
NEUT40|You know, a lot of questions have been raised about the viability of the cable model.
NEUT41|When you look at, you know.
NEUT42|People concerned about cord cutting and turning to Netflix or Hulu or other ways to watching TV.
BEAR43|But the reality is for today we're really just not seeing that much erosion of the core fundamentals.
NEUT44|So you know, I think that any any any concern about the cord cutting stuff, if it hits the stocks is a real opportunity for stocks like Disney.
NEUT45|All right, David?
BULL46|Thanks for joining us.
NEUT47|As always, David bank.
NEUT48|He's a Bloomberg best.
BEAR49|He's an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, were talking to him about Disney, he rates the stock outperformance, says Tron Legacy's disappointing start.
NEUT50|"Isn't going to have too much impact on Disney shares?"""
