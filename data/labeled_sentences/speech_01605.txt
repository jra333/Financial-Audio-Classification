NEUT0|"""Chris Bassett here."
NEUT1|I'm going to talk a little bit about the recent price increase in Bitcoin and my opinions on why that is and the future and what it will look like.
NEUT2|If you're planning on investing.
NEUT3|So a few things to know about Bitcoin is that it's a decentralized currency.
NEUT4|It doesn't need a bank or any kind of administrator, and it's used to purchase things between peer to peer without the need of any kind of intermediate persons.
NEUT5|Some of the main benefits is that it's instant, it's private and it's free from banking fees.
NEUT6|It has a limited supply, so it holds its value.
NEUT7|I think there's around 20 million Bitcoin.
NEUT8|There are multiple companies that accept Bitcoin as a form of transaction.
BULL9|Most recently, Tesla just said that he was going to invest $1.5 billion into Bitcoin and then it would be a future currency he would use that really shot the price of the stock up dramatically.
NEUT10|I think this morning it was sitting around.
BULL11|40 and it went up to 4446.
NEUT12|Now I think it topped out at 48 as of this video.
NEUT13|If you are looking to invest in any kind of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin seems to be the most widely recognized.
NEUT14|The most popular and probably the safest to invest in.
NEUT15|There are some experts saying it's supposed to get up to half $1,000,000 when that will be.
NEUT16|If that's at the end of the year.
NEUT17|Five years, 10 years, nobody can say for real, but there's good estimates that.
NEUT18|It has the ability to be, you know, very.
NEUT19|Expensive by the end of the year, I'm going to invest some of my money into Bitcoin and see how it goes.
NEUT20|I wouldn't invest too much of your savings or like your life savings because it's so volatile.
NEUT21|You could make money just as easily as you could lose money, but there's a pretty good chance.
NEUT22|And like I said with the popular analysts and everyone suggesting.
NEUT23|The way things are going to go was you probably have a good six month period of where you could make some extra cash into it.
NEUT24|So like I said, I'm going to put a little bit of money into it and we'll see.
NEUT25|Put a comment down below as to why you think Bitcoin is a good or bad investment.
NEUT26|I'd like to know.
