BULL0|"""Welcome back guys from the video."
NEUT1|Tesla right now isn't really doing so hot.
BEAR2|It's been at a pretty big losing streak past week down almost 6%.
NEUT3|Today.
BEAR4|It's down almost 2% and Tesla earnings are coming up tomorrow, October 21st after hours with Elon Musk.
BEAR5|So Tesla sold about 100 and 39,000 vehicles and there are even currently cutting prices in some of their models.
NEUT6|And it's not just here in the US but internationally as well.
BEAR7|You also have Tesla facing some pretty big competition from the new.
NEUT8|Electric Hummer that's tributing tonight Tuesday night, which is going to be pretty big.
BEAR9|And once again a lot of companies are launching their own electric versions of cars like the Porsche Tycon, which is going against the Model S. You also have, like the Nissan Leaf stuff like that and so far Tesla stock is dropping.
BEAR10|It's not really because of the competition stock is dropping because of the stimulus.
NEUT11|Since Tesla is now being a lot more stable and not really as volatile as before, it's no longer really the Wall Street casino.
NEUT12|In fact, it's.
BULL13|Pretty stable and it doesn't really move that much, and so far if you like, Tesla is doing a phenomenal job at simply keeping it stability.
NEUT14|This is pretty much moving like a regular S&P 500 stock, which is pretty awesome in my opinion.
NEUT15|So Tesla, well, it's kind of iffy in my opinion.
NEUT16|I feel like on earnings my bull case is probably 464 hundred $70.00.
NEUT17|My bear case is $400.
BEAR18|I don't think Tesla is dropping below $400.
NEUT19|If it does me and a lot of people.
NEUT20|Will most likely be buying shares.
NEUT21|Tesla my opinion a lot of times before earnings and major events, the stock likes to go up and during the event, even though there's a lot of good news.
BEAR22|Stock drops this time with Tesla's, Tesla stock is slowly dropping because of the stimulus package delays.
BULL23|If earnings is really good because they did sell 139 thousand vehicles and there's good guidance which I feel like they're most likely will be.
BULL24|Tesla stock is absolutely going to the moon alot of times on earnings.
BEAR25|Stocks absolutely shoot up, and it's because the past few days before earnings it was completely flat.
BEAR26|Or if there's a slow and steady decline very similar to Tesla.
BEAR27|So if the guidance is good, if earnings is good, we will be seeing a giant boost for Tesla stock a lot of times when Tesla has sort of been going up a lot, and even though there's a lot of really good news, the stock drops because people are selling the news.
BEAR28|The stock is too high.
BEAR29|Short term investors want to take their money leave.
BEAR30|But in this current situation, the stock is dropping, so there's really good news.
BEAR31|Stock will shoot up in my opinion.
NEUT32|That's why it guys.
BULL33|Thanks, watching Ankon blow.
BULL34|Good luck on Tesla earnings.
BULL35|"If you guys are playing it and so far good luck in this super volatile market."""
