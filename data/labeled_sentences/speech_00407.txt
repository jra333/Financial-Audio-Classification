BULL0|"""Welcome back to Squawk Box."
NEUT1|It is time for this morning's executive edge.
NEUT2|We're looking at chairs of draft Kings.
NEUT3|Take a look at this right now.
BEAR4|The stock down 34% this month drop coming despite a ton of sports events.
NEUT5|It's also a number of ballot measures to watch next Tuesday that could impact the company and we should ask the expert Joe what's happening here?
NEUT6|I mean, I don't think.
BULL7|I mean I've been winning.
NEUT8|I mean across the board I I'm not sure that's it.
NEUT9|I don't know whether.
NEUT10|You know it's pretty funny when I'm getting a bad mood and put up, you know, she says what's wrong and I just lost the game and she goes.
NEUT11|How much I said?
NEUT12|$5 she goes.
NEUT13|That's what a lot take costs and I think about it it's like it still matters to me.
NEUT14|It matters.
NEUT15|That's it's a latte.
NEUT16|It's not quite but.
NEUT17|I don't you know that's interesting.
NEUT18|One thing we have seen is just abysmal ratings, but that shouldn't equate necessarily to draft Kings.
NEUT19|I wonder if they're wondering about, yeah, go ahead.
NEUT20|It matters may I guess.
NEUT21|No, I think the ratings matter immensely and the question is, is the ratings problem because there's just too much sports content happening all at one time.
NEUT22|That's one of the arguments and the other argument is whether you think that covid unto itself is changed, everybody's behavior, and even just.
NEUT23|Interest in sports which, if that's the case and if that's long term, that's a bigger challenge.
NEUT24|You know, I think it's the former, not the latter.
NEUT25|I you know, yesterday there was nothing happening.
NEUT26|Zero.
NEUT27|The World Series ended Tuesday.
NEUT28|No, no college football, no NFL.
NEUT29|There's a game today Carolinas playing today, but yesterday I mean, I was I wasn't.
NEUT30|I wasn't sure what to do with my.
NEUT31|I mean I was drinking coffee.
NEUT32|Smoking cigarettes.
NEUT33|You know.
NEUT34|Just you know pacing.
NEUT35|And no, I'm kidding.
NEUT36|I wasn't doing any of those things, but there I did notice there was absolutely nothing to bet on yesterday and today were back.
NEUT37|Then.
NEUT38|If tomorrow, a lot of NCAA games tomorrow night, you have some interest in him and then you then you have Saturday.
NEUT39|Saturday is like the mother of all opportunities.
NEUT40|Anyway DealNews that is interesting though, but you look at the NBA.
NEUT41|What happened with those ratings?
NEUT42|Terrible the final, the World Series terribile the finals.
NEUT43|Even NFL I think is I don't know it's being affected but I I'm wondering whether are the prospects for the dissemination across the whole country dimming in this election for draft Kings.
NEUT44|Do we know whether that what polls say about that is going to pass?
NEUT45|In all these states, do we know that's part of the growth story?
NEUT46|Is it not that it becomes for sure that you can do it everywhere?
NEUT47|'cause you can't do it over here and my they always know where I am?
NEUT48|Which should tell you guys something.
NEUT49|Don't go where you shouldn't go because your phone knows exactly where you are.
NEUT50|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT51|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
