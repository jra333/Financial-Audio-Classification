BEAR0|"""Where is April comes to a close, we're going into what are often the dangerous summer months for stocks."
NEUT1|Yeah, that's right.
NEUT2|I mean, we did the story this morning.
NEUT3|My colleague and I, Tom, we're not saying stocks are going to collapse.
NEUT4|Not saying things were going to be terrible, but we are.
NEUT5|So one of the things we are saying is that you're right, April.
BULL6|If we finish positive today, it's going to be the 7th month in a row of gains for the Dow.
BEAR7|That's something we haven't seen in five portable St. That's quite a streak, and we're now entering the more difficult months here.
NEUT8|I mean, a lot of investors remember 2010, 2011.
NEUT9|And this old saw that they sell in May and go away.
NEUT10|And as you know May is on the doorstep.
BULL11|Here typically means the end of May, but there's some concern that perhaps we get a little jump on that because the earnings picture right now for corporate America it's been good.
BULL12|It's been robust of this past quarter, has been a good one, but still, it's it's interesting.
NEUT13|You mentioned 2010 and 2011 there, because if you think back to 2010, got off to a great start the first quarter is fantastic and then next thing Europe comes along with Greece.
NEUT14|Right last year, same thing.
BULL15|Stocks doing fantastic in the first quarter.
NEUT16|Then we had Europe.
NEUT17|Then we have the debt to bacle, then we had the S&P downgrade.
NEUT18|Then we had Europe all over again.
NEUT19|What's going to?
NEUT20|What disaster is looming this year while the other thing that's looking that looked last year and could be another factor this year is that QE 2 the second round of easing from the Federal Reserve last year, faded around this time.
NEUT21|I mean, I think it was June I think last year I had a baby last year that the second round of bond buying and right and we have Operation Twist.
NEUT22|So that's sort of.
NEUT23|QB 2.5 people say that's slated to end in June again, so it puts us let me just explain one moment there were twists for our viewers.
NEUT24|This is where the Federal Reserve takes its massive Holdings of Treasury bonds ansells the shorter dated ones buys the longer dated one.
NEUT25|So ten years in 30 years to try and keep along yields down.
NEUT26|But effectively it's to help the economy and that help is running out in June this year, as it did last year and you got a lot of those same issues in Europe still there.
NEUT27|It's not Greece, that's the focus has happened.
NEUT28|Could be Spain, it could be.
BEAR29|Italy, still it could be a number of these other countries here, but clearly that uncertainty is still there and I think the concern here is that if we start to get a little bit of slowing down here, given all the gains that we've had this year and given memories of the past two years, it's probably going to be tougher slog going ahead here.
BEAR30|And it's also a case, I guess, where earnings, while they were good in the first quarter, the pace of earnings growth is slowing down when you compare to 2011, 2010, especially when you strip out Apple.
NEUT31|It you know, the Apple effect example effect.
NEUT32|It starts to look like just really modest growth here and look.
BULL33|Growth is better than recession is better than right.
NEUT34|Growth is better than no growth that's right.
BULL35|But on the other hand it may not be enough to help us really plow through some of these concerns that we have because, you know, earnings has really been the driver of the rally that we've seen since the bottom in March 2009, and we've seen valuations come up in the last quarter.
NEUT36|That's a good thing, but I think there's some concern about whether or not right.
BULL37|"Those are robust enough."""
