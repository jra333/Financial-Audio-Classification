NEUT0|"""One place that cash is not going today is in to Stitch Fix that company."
BEAR1|Shares are down by nearly 30% right now the company reported a net loss, blamed that, among other things, on carrier delays in getting shipments of its clothing out to its clients.
BEAR2|The company also came out with sort of a lackluster forecast.
NEUT3|Brian, I know you're watching this one, you know, Stitch Fix is really had a lot of ups and downs over the past several years since it came public.
NEUT4|Julie, I wish I wasn't watching this because this is our all rific horrific move and stitch flick Stitch Fix and I feel that a lot of analysts on the street are just mincing words and they're jumping beyond the obvious here.
BEAR5|This was an awful quarter and it was awful guidance from the company.
NEUT6|Where is the guidance that this could happen three to six months ago?
NEUT7|And you didn't see it out?
NEUT8|Of all the comments on their earnings call last night?
BEAR9|Yeah, you mentioned the carrier delays and higher costs.
BEAR10|That is a consideration, but this is the most worrisome comment that I got from Stitch Fix last night.
NEUT11|The founder and CEO Katrina Lake, noting.
NEUT12|The consumers are seeing less self purchase behavior so that is subsiding and that is being replaced with gifting behavior and what that essentially tells me as consumers are not viewing stitchfix as important place to shop.
NEUT13|It's not top of mind.
NEUT14|Potentially as the economy reopens and people are buying apparel and they are starting to buy apparel, it just doesn't appear to be from Stitch Fix.
NEUT15|Yeah, really interesting and I know you've been watching those other apparel, buying trends happening elsewhere.
NEUT16|Not happening I guess with sporting Apparel, either * ****** Sporting Goods came out with its numbers also came out with a sort of modest forecast.
NEUT17|Here, you know outdoor sporting goods or something that actually did relatively well during the pandemic.
NEUT18|People wanted to get outside, right?
NEUT19|So what exactly is happening now?
NEUT20|What's reflected in those ***** numbers?
NEUT21|Well, Julie, it's it's.
BULL22|They had a good quarter and you put up over 19% same store sales increase.
BULL23|That was really good.
NEUT24|A lot of Macy's would certainly kill for a number like that, so it calls.
NEUT25|But it comes down to guidance here and the end of the day.
NEUT26|The high end of ***** is sales and earnings guidance.
BEAR27|The high end still suggests tailed sales and earnings will be down year over year after a very strong year last year.
NEUT28|And that's all the market cares about right now.
NEUT29|Yeah, looks that way.
NEUT30|All right?
BEAR31|Yeah, we're seeing that drop.
BEAR32|"Not quite as as painful as Stitch Fix for."""
