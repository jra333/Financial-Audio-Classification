NEUT0|"""TGI right now currently trade at 0005 Shout Out to all you guys that watch a video that participated on investors hangout currently traded at 0005."
NEUT1|Well if you look at the notes here and look at the last video we went over this one on Saturday.
NEUT2|If I can kind of figure out exactly which day that was that was going to be right here.
NEUT3|Alright, right between those two candles would have been Saturday and I said watch for the volume to continue on Monday coming in there.
BULL4|Beautiful volume continuing, same exactly actually higher volume.
BULL5|Their volume picked back up just like I thought it would on a Monday and beautiful move off the 0006 getting all the way up to the high of 0012A double 100% off of that I said watch for the volume to continue on Monday.
NEUT6|This goes on technical analysis alert resistance at 810 support F4 beautiful move.
NEUT7|Double off of that.
BULL8|So congratulations you guys, I think they'd still got the momentum in it.
BEAR9|Although it pulled back down, I get that I'm not sitting there going through.
NEUT10|These charts are going to tell you that they're going to continue to keep running.
BEAR11|They're going to continue to keep going up or they're going to continue to go down if I think I see a reversal.
NEUT12|Either way, I'm going to tell you guys the truth.
NEUT13|I'm not going to sit here and just make crap up as we go.
NEUT14|So zero 929 is going to be today's date 0005.
NEUT15|We're going to resistance level in here at 0006 right now is where I see this.
NEUT16|At 6:00 off the last ones are going to be at 8 and 10 support.
NEUT17|Right now I see a 0005 and underneath that at four OK. Watch for the volume.
NEUT18|0005 alright, I'm going to just leave that in there.
NEUT19|As simple as that, right there, resistance at 6/8 and 10.
NEUT20|OK, that's gonna be 000600080010 support 0005 and four.
BULL21|Watch for the volume to pick up on Monday, an bounce off of the 0005 area again.
NEUT22|123 days of pulling this one back down.
NEUT23|Watch for the reversal here.
NEUT24|I think it's possible, but it's all going to depend on that.
BULL25|0005 maybe 0004, but I think you guys have a huge support down here at 0004.
NEUT26|It was therefore it's going to be a must hold guys, even though today you did tap it, watch reversal off of it.
NEUT27|But that being said, TGI, if you follow the stock it definitely courage you to hit that like and subscribe on this video right now.
NEUT28|I would really appreciate it and get out there and shoot this video with all other investors on different social network stack message words and stack forms.

NEUT45|So TGI a tongue twister.
BULL46|But hey, we're still going to watch this one bounce off the 0005 and hopefully get back up to those other levels of my trade here for maybe a few days and then continue up.
NEUT47|But either way I do like to wait at this chart setting up.
NEUT48|I do think the potential still here.
