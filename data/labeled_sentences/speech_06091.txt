NEUT0|"""So I'm joined by Jim Swanson, the Chief investment strategist at MFS."
NEUT1|You come here with a spring in your step.
BULL2|Now that we finally got some spring weather, you're very optimistic about the market and the economy.
NEUT3|And I wondered if you just give me a quick explanation.
BEAR4|Why, sure, what we're seeing recently is a falling energy prices, which is basically a boost to buying power for the US consumer, and that 70% of the US society, an economy.
BULL5|And then we're seeing a rising dollar, which also gives them more buying power.
BULL6|So in a period where the business cycle isn't threatened by these things, in fact, it's enhanced.
NEUT7|And that's a slightly contraposition, because a lot of the traders out there have been watching the rise and the rise and the rise of the dollar, with some some some nervousness.
NEUT8|Sure, do.
NEUT9|Do you think that there comes a point where the dollars rise starts to negatively impact the market?
BEAR10|I think the dollar could negatively impact the market because much of the SMP about 40% of its sold outside the US.
NEUT11|But when you dissect it and find out where those sales are coming from, it's mostly tech which is deflating asset class their product.
BEAR12|Goes down in price every year, so the rise in the dollar is not going to affect them.
NEUT13|The next biggest foreign facing sector is energy and we already know their commodities down net net.
BULL14|The rest of the world should benefit from lower input costs and I think we're going to see faster growth at the end of the year.
NEUT15|We do have a question about valuations though.
NEUT16|After this very, very long bull market for equities, valuations on measures like the Shiller Cape.
NEUT17|Other measures to really looks stretched.
NEUT18|But that's something you can see through.
NEUT19|I can see through it because I look at a lot of measures.
NEUT20|I don't think just one measure tells me there's an overpriced market.
NEUT21|One of the measures I look at is free cash flow yield.
NEUT22|Take the free cash flow of all these companies.
NEUT23|Divide by market cap.
NEUT24|That suggests the markets cheap.
NEUT25|I weigh all these and say it's certainly not a bargain.
BULL26|But if earnings keep going up and that's what I think will happen in this environment of strong dollar, an low energy, I believe that you're going to see earnings resume their upward path later this year, and that will justify these relatively high peas.
NEUT27|As as unemployment falls, so one final final question about about valuations is do you think that the historically outsized profitability of companies might come under pressure?
BULL28|We're starting to see minimum wage rises at places like Target and Walmart.
NEUT29|Do you think those pressures are going to start to come through the system and maybe finally workers are going to get a piece of the pie that the shareholders have enjoyed for awhile?
BULL30|I think you're right.
BEAR31|I think the worker in the United States will begin to ask for higher wages because the unemployment rate keeps falling.
NEUT32|The good news for shareholders is that doesn't seem to affect when you look back at history margins for about 18 months or so, so the market tends to keep moving up, but we have to watch this very carefully.
NEUT33|We will get to the point where this profit story in the margin story will erodes just for what you ask for.
NEUT34|The time being labor and capital winners together.
BULL35|Yes, thanks very much.
BULL36|"Thank you."""
