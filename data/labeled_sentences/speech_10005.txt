NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up, guys, it's Jerrod and today I'm going to be showing you a little website that's really helpful if you're looking for stock options that have a lot of volume in this right."
NEUT1|Here is the website.
BEAR2|Itisbarchart.com/options/volume Dash leaders slash stocks.
NEUT3|I will put it in.
NEUT4|The description of the video, so you can just click that and go straight to it.
NEUT5|But yeah here here it is.
NEUT6|This is the page.
NEUT7|Basically just shows you the highest volume options contracts for the day, so it is currently Saturday, February 15th, so these are all for Friday before close.
NEUT8|As you can see the highest volume option traded Friday was the Microsoft 187 five strike for next Friday on the 21st and here it tells you days to expiration, bid, midpoint, ask and last.
NEUT9|And then over here is the volume.
NEUT10|And like I said, it's going to be the highest then as you go down it will get lower.
NEUT11|But as you can see it at 37,000 volume, 12,000 open interest gives you the volatility in open interest ratio and everything implied volatility and then over.
NEUT12|Here is the current price right beside the ticker and then also it's pretty important it shows you the type right here which is going to be a call or put in this case it's the call and yeah that's the most traded one now.
NEUT13|There's a lot you can do with this information, but I'd generally like to check this just kind of get an idea of what has a lot of volume, because I do want to be trading and buying into options that have a lot of volume and there are very liquid because you don't want to be buying an option and then there's no volume and you can't even sell if you need to get out of it.
NEUT14|So it's really nice to have really high volume options, but keep in mind, this doesn't mean just by Microsoft 187 five 'cause everybody else is.
NEUT15|This could mean they're all selling it.
NEUT16|It could mean.
NEUT17|They bought it a week ago and now everybody selling it or or something like that.
NEUT18|So just don't buy straight off of this, but you can use it.
NEUT19|It's really good resource if you need to find some ideas, get some inspiration on which stocks you should be trading.
NEUT20|You can also go over here to ETF's and it'll show you the volume and all that for the ETF's as you can tell spy is pretty much the most traded one.
NEUT21|But yeah, you got all them.
NEUT22|Lot of volume on them as well.
BULL23|So a lot of opportunities to make some good spreads and good trades.
NEUT24|And yeah, that there's a lot more on this website as well.
NEUT25|They can go into more depth in another video, but this is the option volume leader section on barchart com and it's extremely useful an I recommend it.
NEUT26|Alright, so I think that's going to do it for this video.
NEUT27|It was just a short helpful video that hopefully you get some value out of an take advantage of this website because it is very useful and they do have even more information headlines, a little chart and everything.
NEUT28|And even more if you click it.
BULL29|Yeah, it's really great website to take advantage of and I think it's going to do it for this video.
NEUT30|I can go into more depth on more stuff and some more videos in the future, but thanks for watching.
