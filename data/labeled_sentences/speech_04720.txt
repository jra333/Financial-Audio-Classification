NEUT0|"""Ride hailing service."
NEUT1|Lyft has kicked off as a publicly traded company.
BULL2|The shares are hitting the market at $72 above the predicted target range of $62.00 to $68 per share, an indicator of strong investor demand.
BEAR3|But despite the positive early signs, analysts and investors have concerns about the company's road to profitability.
NEUT4|Lift has three key challenges that it will face in its first year as a publicly traded company.
BEAR5|First, Lyft is losing a lot of money.
BULL6|The companies $911 million loss last year was the biggest of any US startup in the 12 months preceding its IPO last year, Lyft spent $1.3 billion on marketing and incentives like discounted rides to help Rev up market share, averaging out to an operating cost of about $2.00 per ride.
BEAR7|Investors had hoped for incentives to end years ago, but now many of them expect they'll taper after the IPO.
BULL8|Since Lyft won't be racing to raise capital, the company also hopes to lower insurance costs.
BULL9|One of its biggest expenses, as it gains greater share.
BULL10|Second, the ongoing potential for more local regulation over driver pay.
BEAR11|This is seen as another possible cash drain since it could mean higher labor and compliance costs.
BEAR12|For example, Lyft says its growth has been stunted by New York City's recent ride hailing regulations, freezing licenses, and forcing companies to pay guaranteed rates to drivers.
NEUT13|The main questions now are, could there be more regulations and could more cities follow that model?
NEUT14|3rd the obvious.
BULL15|Its toughest rival Uber could be better positioned for growth.
NEUT16|Huber's portfolio includes a meal delivery service, an long distance freight, while Lyft is limited to the ride hailing business in the US and Canada.
BULL17|On top of all that Goober just agreed to acquire Middle Eastern rival Careem Networks in a $3.1 billion deal that could help Uber reach 1 billion users as it prepares to go public later this year.
NEUT18|How Lyft fares.
BULL19|Against these challenges in its first year as a public company is yet to be seen, but one thing is clear as the first of several money losing startups gearing up for IPO's.
NEUT20|Lift is the test case.
NEUT21|"That Wall Street and its competitors will be watching."""
