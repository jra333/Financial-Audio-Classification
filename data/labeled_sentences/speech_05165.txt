NEUT2|The stock ticker is NBEV, new age beverages company fuels health conscious consumers with a diversified all natural functional beverage portfolio spanning numerous product categories.
BULL3|So a purpose driven company delivering healthy alternatives to customers and empowering them to collectively participate in the.
NEUT4|Growing better for you movement, I took a look at their product line and they really do have very healthy type drinks.
NEUT5|One of their products is Coco Libre coconut water.
NEUT6|You have three different types, their original sparkling and protein enhanced.
NEUT7|Then they have their.
NEUT8|I believe it's pronounced Xingtai all natural teas and energy drinks.
NEUT9|They have live kombucha.
NEUT10|Relaxation drinks an ready to drink coffees so they partnered with Bob Marley Beverage Company.
NEUT11|Then they have their water line Aspen pure, which is supposedly one of the only waters that is pH balanced in the United States and they have probiotic water as well.
BULL12|Caught my eye today, only been watching it today because it went up 104% and so.
NEUT13|What is the big deal with them while they're releasing a line of drinks that are infused with CBD oil, a non psychoactive cannabinoid compound of marijuana, so their rumored to pair up with Aurora Cannabis, another hot stock as well, and where it is on the street that Coke is very interested in infused drinks and they're looking to expand in that way in the future and they're looking to partner with a company so.
BULL14|Not necessarily these guys, but it definitely makes them a very good candidate.
NEUT15|And so everybody is going crazy trying to figure out who it's going to be.
NEUT16|And so basically this is all based off of takeover rumors that are driving the spike.
NEUT17|So if you do decide to go in right away for a minute and get out because I've done it before and I've gotten hit pretty hard because a lot of times it is purely just hype.
NEUT18|And then if it's not true, it's going to crash and it's going to crash hard.
NEUT19|But until then, it will definitely continue its rapid pace, because everybody's talking about it on the message boards and you know, everybody's looking for the next big thing.
NEUT20|What's it going to be?
NEUT21|How do I make a quick Buck?
NEUT22|And so people are buying this thing and they're buying a lot of it now.
