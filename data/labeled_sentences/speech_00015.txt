NEUT2|The day before yesterday and now we can see the year May 5 and May 20.
BULL3|Already from the one line and very near to the EM A50.
BEAR4|So the momentum for Apple stock continues to drop, so the momentum is not bullish is bearish.
NEUT5|And if we check the volume here, the volume is.
BULL6|Comparably, a little bit larger than yesterday, so it's still a very site.
BEAR7|So in my opinion, currently the short term the Apple stock, still in a downtrend effect.

NEUT13|To go lower from here.
NEUT14|And if so.
BEAR15|The whole U.S. market will lose a leader.
NEUT16|A former leader of the whole market.
