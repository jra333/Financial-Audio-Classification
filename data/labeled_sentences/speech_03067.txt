BEAR0|"""People are already making jokes that Bullard and Kashkari are gunning for."
NEUT1|Fed chair is that where we are?
NEUT2|Well, I don't think that's going to happen, but I think that we are gunning for 50 basis points on July 31st and I think that's going to happen.
NEUT3|I don't think that's going to stop there and you gotta remember, you know, back in the last cycle, the first rate cut in September 2007 with 50 basis points, you go back to the cycle before then when the Fed starts first started cutting rates in January of 2001, first rate cut 50 basis points.
NEUT4|And both those time periods, nobody saw recession coming.
NEUT5|Although it came two months later in both situations.
NEUT6|But it does in those situations also.
NEUT7|50 basis points didn't take us almost 30% of the way down to the bottom.
NEUT8|That's a good point, but that was the famous you know, quote from the Q&A about the.
NEUT9|You know, the ounce of prevention for the pedicure.
NEUT10|I mean, that was it right?
NEUT11|There brilliantly planted question and he told us right then and there that you know, at these low levels are rates.
NEUT12|You know if you're going to, you're going to big.
BULL13|Although Claritas point this morning is we actually have some cushion from zero bound.
NEUT14|So which is it, Carson?
NEUT15|Well, definitely that's more of Davids domain in mind, but I guess my question is really, how much are the are the governors, especially the Chair Chairman?
NEUT16|Thinking about the institutional independence of the Fed mean.
NEUT17|LBJ used to behind the scenes bully fed chairman when he wanted rate cuts?
NEUT18|That's not that's not new, but what's new?
NEUT19|Is this public bullying of the Fed?
NEUT20|How do you maintain the independence of the Fed and cut rates in this situation called going into an election year by the yeah.
NEUT21|Well, I don't.
NEUT22|I don't think there is any particular pressure there was on Mario Draghi and these central bankers.
NEUT23|They talk to each other practically every single day.
NEUT24|So you know this is a this is coordinated.
BEAR25|The European data have been very weak.
NEUT26|What was one of the central focus focal points in the press conference from from Powell was about the weakening trend overseas, and I think primarily talking about Europe and they're coming appropriately concerned about capital spending.
BEAR27|Which has been extraordinarily weak in the past couple of quarters and leading indicators are pointing to further softness, so I think you're right about you know the Trump tweets and all the pressure is really, you know.
NEUT28|Unfortunately it's it's.
NEUT29|It's negative noise, but I don't think that the Fed will be acting any differently.
NEUT30|If you know we weren't seeing this pressure out of the White House.
NEUT31|I mean, 50 bips would be alot.
BULL32|Well, like I said before, they went 50 each of the last two cycles.
NEUT33|That was their first move and I know that people are going to say, well, you know they didn't change their macro forecast.
NEUT34|Still roughly 2%, but you know the Fed.
NEUT35|"As a group or risk managers, you know, just like portfolio managers are and so their comfort zone or their confidence around their forecasts has been deteriorated markedly because the one thing that happened in that press conference that never happened before was a Fed chairman uttering the word uncertainty 7 times, so they have a lack of confidence over their economic forecasts and all the risks are skewed to the downside."""
