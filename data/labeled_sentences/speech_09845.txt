NEUT0|"""Hello guys, my name is Talha Stylo invests and today I'm going to give you guys an update on Gevo and the stock market in general."
NEUT1|Later in the video.
NEUT2|Before I do I'd like to thank the 222 wonderful people that decided to subscribe to the channel and I'd urge you to do so if you want to watch someone make money and potentially yourself.
NEUT3|By the way make sure to stay to the end for place I believe will reverse and over by at this moment in time.
NEUT4|Without further ado.
NEUT5|Here's my take on Gevo for those that don't know, Geva produces biofuels sustainably, and I've been invested since $2.00.
NEUT6|I could have locked in profits by see this guys going along way and $30 by the end of the year might just take vacation for this.
BULL7|They have their net 01802 plants which will provide him for contracts with millions of dollars.
NEUT8|Like the one amended yesterday with Scandinavian Airlines for over $100 million.
BULL9|More contracts like this due to come as airlines soon start to reopen after Covid is overcome globally.
BEAR10|Now normally this would have a positive effect on the stock price itself, but due to the state of the stock market which I will talk about in a minute, the share price plummeted today to at one point $9.50.
NEUT11|Personally, call that a Black Friday sale and would definitely buy if I didn't already have such a large position to answer what most of you are wondering, am I still bullish on Gevo?
NEUT12|Of course I am.
NEUT13|It's a long term play which I suggest you get into such a low price.
NEUT14|Coming from someone who's been in since the start now in terms of the stock market in the stock market.
BEAR15|This is a result of a deteriorating hope for stimulus checks combined with interest rates and other factors currently affecting the US economy.
NEUT16|This is why keeping free cash on the side for reversal places so important, even though my whole portfolio is redder than Mars, I'm still using my cash to buy undervalued stocks like Mara.
BULL17|That will definitely go up as Bitcoin consolidates crypto plays out more a SOS riot B or QS, and so on and so forth are prone to consolidation and will rise.
BULL18|As Bitcoin reaches new highs more, in my opinion is a $60.00 play.
BULL19|So I picked up share today for reversal around the $29.00 range.
BEAR20|After a huge dip from around $40, I also bought a T&F which suffered a dip for an easy reversal.
NEUT21|Remember guys when others are fearful you become greedy.
NEUT22|Anyway, that was my take on Gevo and the stock market.
NEUT23|As of right now, if you have any place you think will reverse after the storm is over, come let me know in the comments section down below.
NEUT24|If you knew, please drop a like and drop a sub as it takes a lot of time to do DD and record and edit so I'd appreciate it a lot anyways guys until next time.
NEUT25|"Peace."""
