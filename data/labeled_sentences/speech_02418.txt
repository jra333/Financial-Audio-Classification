NEUT0|"""Alright, so Walt Disney stock is at $154.14 with a market cap of $279 billion, which is awesome."
BEAR1|We've had a nice run up and we're staying steady in the $150 range, but in today's news got some sad ones for the kiddos Radio Disney to shut down in the first quarter of 2021 amid Walt Disney companies.
NEUT2|Restructuring.
NEUT3|So.
NEUT4|The law, the Long running Network which launched in November 1996, is closing its door for good and a few months spokesperson confirmed to Fox Business.
NEUT5|Radio Disney, an Radio Disney Country will cease operations in the first quarter of 2021.
BULL6|The difficult decision to close these two radio networks coincided with Disney's recently announced structural changes that call for Disney branded television to sharpen its focus on increasing production of kids and family content for Disney Plus and Disney Channel and Disney Channels.
NEUT7|So.
NEUT8|Essentially, it's kind of odd.
NEUT9|I mean, Disney is a kid friendly family friendly company and.
NEUT10|I think they're kind of realizing that.
NEUT11|They need to cut costs.
NEUT12|This probably isn't earning them really money.
NEUT13|It might, but I think with the environment that we're in with covid.
NEUT14|Realize that they need to.
NEUT15|Clear House where they can and this is one of those laggers.
NEUT16|It's just the you lag behind.
NEUT17|With.
NEUT18|Something you know they put.
NEUT19|They have to hire a bunch of people.
NEUT20|It costs money to maintain all the equipment an they need.
NEUT21|They need to cut that out.
NEUT22|It's a business that they know.
NEUT23|They can't.
NEUT24|They can sustain doing it, but this is all about money they need to.
BEAR25|Become profitable where they can and they need to focus because the covid pandemic has hit them very, very hard.
NEUT26|So I just want you to be aware that hey they are restructuring an.
NEUT27|It's sad, but also good news for mass tax standpoint, because this just isn't one of those heavy hitters, and they're focusing on their streaming content now because their parks it probably won't become normal for years an.
NEUT28|They they need to change their focus, so do some research.
NEUT29|You know, have some fun.
NEUT30|Make some money.
