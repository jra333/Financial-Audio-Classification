BULL0|"""Alright, we're back."
NEUT1|It's Q&A time.
NEUT2|First up, Paul tweets us.
NEUT3|Is it time to buy MasterCard on the pullback?
NEUT4|Pete, you got that one?
NEUT5|Yes, the answer is yes.
NEUT6|I think it's really easy.
NEUT7|I think these credit card names, Visa or MasterCard take your pick.
NEUT8|Both of my think are absolutely outstanding and we all toy with, which is better, which is not.
NEUT9|I think Mastercards actually damn right.
NEUT10|Pete and I actually added to it this morning.
NEUT11|There you go thank God smarts, right?
NEUT12|Good stuff.
NEUT13|Thank you.
BEAR14|You're right, Dustin from New York says jd.com is at a 52 week low.
NEUT15|Ahead of earnings, is it worth a shot via call options or an outright by Doc?
NEUT16|You guys probably worth a shot judge, but I talked about this one last week.
NEUT17|Bought it last week.
BEAR18|The calls went right in my face immediately and when the calls lost about half their value I dumped out.
BULL19|So it's probably a good time to be in since I just got out.
NEUT20|Alright, a friend, Jean in Philadelphia asks on the pullback.
NEUT21|Would Tiffany be a place to look before earnings looks good valuation though though.
NEUT22|Hi Jim yeah used to own its own story here.
NEUT23|Well a couple of things.
NEUT24|First off the.
NEUT25|Valuation is more than a little bit high, so I think you wait.
NEUT26|The fall has traditionally been a time to buy this in terms of seasonality.
BEAR27|I don't know why every summer something seems to happen at Tiffany's, but I wouldn't be surprised if they said China demand is lowering because we've seen some China GDP numbers or industrial production numbers that are lower than expected.
NEUT28|China is important to them, and if these trade war issues are taking root in Tiffany's numbers, you want to wait until after the earnings call.
NEUT29|Gotta question for Joe as well.
NEUT30|Michelle in Minneapolis wants to know which do you prefer?
NEUT31|Amazon or alphabet.
NEUT32|Michelle lives in a great city, doesn't see right there?
NEUT33|Does it?
NEUT34|Sure, does I own both Amazon an alphabet.
NEUT35|So that's a challenging question.
BULL36|I obviously believe Amazon, as I said to you before, is going to have 2000 and I think it will join Apple a trillion dollar market cap.
NEUT37|Will we make the valuation argument?
NEUT38|We've got to go with Alphabet, but I'm long both.
NEUT39|That's why Pete didn't get that way.
NEUT40|He would have waxed on and on and on about the Twin Cities.
NEUT41|So it's so great, so great 10,000 meters away.
NEUT42|10,000 brother.
NEUT43|After that we love ourselves.
NEUT44|No question for me.
NEUT45|Johnny oh is sleeping in.
NEUT46|Left out in the cold.
NEUT47|Sorry Weiss, well you chipped in on the market for week are things but in your sense that's right peeps, just one else Johnny oh, you know alright and reminder.
NEUT48|Send your questions to us.
NEUT49|Weiss included.
NEUT50|"Slash halftime."""
