BEAR0|"""Things keep looking downhill for Nikola it was announced early this morning that the electric truck makers founder Trevor Milton is stepping down as executive Chairman just a little over a week after short seller Hindenburg Research released a report saying Nicola misled investors."
BEAR1|Yahoo Finance's Rick Newman is here with the details, so Rick's stock is down about 21% right now.
NEUT2|Does Trevor Milton stepping down from Nicola?
NEUT3|Can you like in that at all to his?
NEUT4|If Elon Musk were to step down?
NEUT5|From a Tesla, I think that's exactly what the market is trying to figure out with what's going on here, so the stock was actually done a little bit more at the open.
BEAR6|It started out down about 27% and it's got a bit of a snap back from that.
BEAR7|So now down about 21% General Motors stock also down, but not nearly as much.
NEUT8|Of course Nicola had that deal with GM, which kind of put them on the map in the 1st place, so the market is trying to figure out is this company for real or not, and I don't think we know the answer today.
NEUT9|Rick isn't the other component to this sell off that Milton owns 20% of the stock valued before this, all fit about 3 point.
NEUT10|$3.3 billion that now that he's no longer involved the company, it dumps a steak and waves goodbye, right?
NEUT11|So if you on Musk were to do that at Tesla, it would.
NEUT12|It would sort of signal the end of the company as we know it, but look at other companies like this.
BEAR13|I mean, Uber CEO resigned after a lot of controversy at that company, and obviously Uber.
NEUT14|Soldiers on so Uber was independent of its founder.
NEUT15|It turned out it's very early in Nicholas Story here.
NEUT16|I mean, they haven't even produced a vehicle yet, and that's the real question of this company.
NEUT17|Is the technology real or is it vaporware?
NEUT18|One thing I would point out, I guess two things actually, you know, General Motors.
NEUT19|They aren't dummies.
NEUT20|They know they're doing.
NEUT21|They have a lot of expertise at the top of that company and you would think they would have vetted Nicola before they made this deal to buy a stake in the company.
NEUT22|And to provide technology once they actually start building trucks, if they ever do start building trucks so you gotta have a little bit of faith.
NEUT23|At least I think in GM.
NEUT24|And the other thing is that the other person involved in Nikola is a guy named Steve Girsky.
NEUT25|He was vice chairman at General Motors and he started this blank check company called Vector IQ which became Nicola when the firms, when the firm went public in June.
NEUT26|Steve Girsky also ought to know what he's doing.
NEUT27|So if Turner Milton snowed, all of these longtime industry professionals, it was quite a magic act.
NEUT28|I think there's reason to think there might still be some value tucked away in this company.
BEAR29|And at least one Wall Street firm coming to the defense of Nicola today this morning, Rick, we've got Cowan saying weakness in the stock is a buying opportunity, not the last we've heard of this saga.
NEUT30|There you go.
NEUT31|So will you.
