NEUT0|"""So there's some interesting strategies, at least clues about strategies going into the last couple of quarters of the year."
NEUT1|I'm a home gamer for Tepper.
NEUT2|I do love him an I find that we don't know what we've got some fantastic notes this morning.
BULL3|JP embracing all the the payment processors, doing incredible going into Disney, was a gutsy move because you had to believe that Disney Plus was going to be great.
NEUT4|Pretty soon we're going to be seeing we're going to go to the movies again, conscious that it was a rainy weekend.
NEUT5|The old days would have gone the movies and now we're afraid of getting covid go in the movies and maybe they can do something about that.
BEAR6|But I just feel the temper is spot on with the processors because that is the anti bank trade and they keep going.
NEUT7|I I did someone last week on May have money PayPal.
NEUT8|I don't know what stops PayPal.
NEUT9|That is just a juggernaut.
NEUT10|Yeah, and then some of the other moves that we got from these filings.
BULL11|Ackman, upping Lowe's.
NEUT12|We talked about home rebuilding.
NEUT13|Third Point.
NEUT14|Of course, we already knew about some of their steps, but new stakes in Facebook ATVI Jim N Baba, which is making news for other reasons today, as the president says.
NEUT15|In fact they are looking at some new restrictions.
NEUT16|Yeah, Ali Baba's, the one that has the most US financials, but there hardly is a moment that that the president doesn't try to put the squeeze on China.
NEUT17|I think that I want is the biggest.
NEUT18|That's the one I'm most worried about.
NEUT19|In terms of the Chinese saying, listen up, we're done, we're going to take our.
NEUT20|We're going to extract whatever we can get from Taiwan.
NEUT21|Semi will steal their, will, steal all their intellectual property.
NEUT22|I'm very concerned about that on the Lowe's call by Ackman.
NEUT23|Marvin Ellison has finally gotten that e-commerce side down.
BULL24|He's done a remarkable job taking account that company into the 21st century.
BULL25|Ello W remains a win, and I think that when we see ellisons numbers, it's still going to be caveat.
NEUT26|He's still going to say he's not there.
NEUT27|He's a humble man.
BULL28|But he is making progress.
BULL29|"I like that call."""
