NEUT0|"""It's skinny and a weekly top 50 will come back here the 2nd of November 2020 Monday, the first day of the week we are at #38 Maker with the ticker MKR."
NEUT1|So for Maker again CDH we have been trending down a particular channel.
BEAR2|We think this is a gigantic channel that Maker has been down in 12345.
NEUT3|Is it normally waves come in trees or five and I count 5-4 maker against each?
NEUT4|So is this the end?
NEUT5|Are we going to be rising up?
NEUT6|Yes no, we are not sure we don't see any bottoming.
NEUT7|Doesn't look like a bottoming.
NEUT8|Move to me.
NEUT9|We could.
BULL10|We could rise against IDH but I really don't see it yet.
NEUT11|Not at this point of time.
NEUT12|I think eventually it will, but we would love to see some clear moves coming in for Maker against IDH first before taking a trade for Maker so.
NEUT13|Be very, very careful about going to trade too soon.
BEAR14|Yes, we already over so we are quite oversold actually against.
NEUT15|Under stochastic against it.
BULL16|So there could be a bounce coming in for Maker.
NEUT17|We're not exactly sure, so be very, very careful about going to trade too.
BEAR18|So now we will let you know if you see any bullishness, but it has all been bearish.
NEUT19|Look at a bearish volume.
NEUT20|Look at it.
NEUT21|It is big volume bar over here.
NEUT22|So bearish so very so very social barriers to get a cluster of volume bars so so bearish.
BEAR23|So things are still very bearish for Meeker.
NEUT24|How we would love to see some positive moves coming, but we're not going to move ourselves until we see until we spot the wheels of Maker.
NEUT25|Making a move themselves?
BULL26|Alright, let's move onto Maker against USD.
NEUT27|But before that please give this video a like.
NEUT28|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about Maker in the comments below for Maker against USD.
BEAR29|Second, inversely insurance left shoulder hit right shoulder pump should be blasting off our maker against USD.
BULL30|But then again, we would love it if we could rise up here because there's a danger that this could be a head and shoulders so we could drop lower as well.
BEAR31|So yeah, if you do drop then the support we find support around $300 from $500.
BEAR32|We will probably drop to $300.00.
NEUT33|So again, we're not exactly sure what's happening for Maker, so we're being very, very cautious about going to a trip too soon, and so should you.
NEUT34|Write makers.
BULL35|Solid point, I think Maker eventually will rise, but you need to get your timing right, alright?
NEUT36|I guess I see from my maker technical analysis.
BULL37|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL38|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT39|"I shall see you in the next video."""
