NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking looking at the gold market you can see the gold has done very little."
BEAR1|During the week, and I think that's going to be something worth paying attention to because it's GBX the gold volatility index is dropping.
NEUT2|That's bullish, money tends to flow to places where it's not going to get shaken out.
NEUT3|1900 underneath offer support.
NEUT4|1800 offer support as well.
NEUT5|I'd be all over a dipped 1800.
BULL6|Keep in mind that the US dollar is starting to show some signs of life and if that's going to be the case, that could work against gold in the short term, but I look at that as.
NEUT7|A buying opportunity long-term, fundamentally speaking, gold.
BULL8|Has everything lining up for it, so I'm still bullish on gold.
BULL9|"I just would like to see some type of pullback that I can take advantage of."""
