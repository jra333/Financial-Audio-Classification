NEUT0|"""OK guys I need to talk about expense stock."
BULL1|It's come to a really really attractive level.
NEUT2|First of all let me start off by reading this ex.
NEUT3|Bing also wants volume to come quickly.
NEUT4|Unlike neo.
NEUT5|He says the company is not a brand for the Super rich but it's targeting the 30,000 to 45,000 segment or about 25,000 to €37,000.
NEUT6|This is the most attractive market segment, so X Bing this car right over here.
NEUT7|Cost 229 thousand RMB and I did the conversion and that current words to around €29,000.
NEUT8|Or are you kidding me?
NEUT9|You're telling me this car right over here which is compareable to a Tesla Model S is for €29,000 OK.
NEUT10|I know that this is the starting price and you can add pretty cool features like intelligent **** Bait, an A cool car system, an autonomous driving.
BULL11|There's all that in this EV Chinese maker, and it's backed by the Chinese government, and it's already started to expand to Norway with one of their G3 models.
NEUT12|So to be honest, I like the model G3, but I like the P7 a lot more.
BULL13|I believe once the P7 starts to come to Europe, that will be really good.
NEUT14|An Norway is a really great country for electric vehicles, so this is pretty interesting to me.
NEUT15|Now let's see what they did last quarter.
NEUT16|Well, last quarter they reach around 8578 vehicles sold.
BULL17|That's an increase of 265%.
NEUT18|So the revenue they're making is 279 million for the quarter.
NEUT19|So let's say for around a year they're making an 1 billion in revenue.
BEAR20|Well, I think the growth in this company can be insane, as countries in Europe need to go electric by 2030.
NEUT21|That's what one of my friends said.
NEUT22|And 2030 the year guys all cars have to be electrican.
NEUT23|What are you going to see when you see a car like this?
NEUT24|Come parable to the Model 7 in Europe.
NEUT25|In America you're going to have to buy this.
NEUT26|This is the future and people just have to accept it.
NEUT27|So even if the company has a market cap of 26 billion and it's only making 1 billion in revenue, well I think that's pretty decent.
BULL28|An pretty fine for a company like this.
BULL29|It's got great technology an is.
NEUT30|Spending money to make giga factories just like Tesla.
BULL31|It's gotta love backing from great investors.
NEUT32|Now.
BEAR33|One of the reasons I research why this stock is coming down and it's been in pressure is 'cause insiders have been selling it.
NEUT34|I mean, you can't blame them.
BEAR35|The stock is down 52%.
NEUT36|People wanted to take some profits.
BEAR37|It came down so people got scared.
NEUT38|They insiders of the company thought that they could invest their money somewhere else.
BEAR39|So it started to go down.
NEUT40|But also some other institutions have started to buy expect in this dip.
NEUT41|I would say so so.
NEUT42|Also cause of this Evie market crash you look at Tesla.
NEUT43|A bunch of different eaves, mainly because of lucid Motors.
NEUT44|Make this whole easy game come down, and I think this is the perfect opportunity to buy the dip.
BEAR45|It's already down 52% and the company hasn't really changed.
NEUT46|Hasn't really said much, hasn't done much advertising.
BULL47|The PR's not that great at the moment, but once these sales start to pick up I do believe in this great company that's it for this video guys.
NEUT48|If you have any questions let me know down below in the comments section below and I'll see you guys.
NEUT49|"Next time."""
