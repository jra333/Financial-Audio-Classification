NEUT0|"""Just to talk a little bit about what your partnership has meant to each other, how many years would have been partners with Charlie?"
NEUT1|I met him in 1959 and we instantly became partners and thinking and then over the years we develop all these financial relationships but.
NEUT2|I knew immediately what the meaning Charlie, that that we were going to be.
BULL3|We're In Sync and we've lasted a lot longer than I thought we would.
BULL4|But yeah, but we have had incredible fun together.
NEUT5|We've we've done all kinds of things.
NEUT6|Some work, some haven't worked, and.
NEUT7|We've never had an argument we we disagree on things sometimes, but we've never.
NEUT8|We've never had an argument Ann.
NEUT9|Never second guess me.
NEUT10|I try not to second guess him, but it's a great relationship Charlie, 60 years.
NEUT11|Did you know at that first meeting that you have a partnership?
NEUT12|Well, I know that we were on the same page, but.
NEUT13|It's been very lucky that whole company became as big as it didn't.
BULL14|We've had the run we've had.
NEUT15|What's it like?
BULL16|I think we're very talented and all that, but we've also had a tailwind of good luck.
NEUT17|What's it like in terms of how you all kind of use each other as sounding boards?
NEUT18|How does that work?
NEUT19|Well, I'm here.
NEUT20|If you will collaborate in their own way, they are better off.
NEUT21|Einstein would not be able to do what he did if he didn't have various people to talk to.
NEUT22|It's more fun to, yeah, the ideas are better net, but it's also more fun when we disagree.
BULL23|Charlie says, well, you'll end up agreeing with me because you're smart and I'm right.
NEUT24|Very simple.
NEUT25|He is right.
NEUT26|That's the hell, but not always.
NEUT27|You're both pretty.
NEUT28|You both act pretty unilaterally, though you both kind of do your own things and then come to each other after factor, sure.
NEUT29|He knows what I'm thinking.
NEUT30|I know what he's thinking.
NEUT31|And Anne.
NEUT32|"Either one of us would ever do anything we read about the other ones opposed we might we might feel with a little something to do, but we we are In Sync."""
