BEAR0|"""How can this market snap out of that bizarre made Les where the reopening stocks keep roaring and everything else especially tech and healthcare gets left behind it that day, with the Dow decline 100 points be .32%, the NASDAQ actually did a little bit better edge down .11% but still headed for its worst month since October."
NEUT1|Let me tell you what needs to happen.
NEUT2|I've got the solution all right and it's a little complex.
NEUT3|Won't give it to you first.
BEAR4|There is way too much speculation this market we're still seeing lots of money.
NEUT5|Bring the areas that are very hard to value.
NEUT6|Just look at the crawl at the bottom.
NEUT7|I mean you see this right down here.
NEUT8|I mean, see right below me.
NEUT9|OK, look at this.
NEUT10|I'm not saying those companies are worthless, but the amount of iron the changes hands every day in that low dollar stock and that load dollars pocketnow wlodarczyk.
NEUT11|That should make you fart looking down.
NEUT12|She makes you very nervous.
BEAR13|It's a sign of excessive speculation with inflation.
NEUT14|These are the moral equivalent of penny stocks, for heaven's sake.
NEUT15|2nd.
NEUT16|Too much grief, yeah, one look at the newly launched Ark Space Exploration ETF tells you everything you need to know about how managers can't resist creating new funds.
NEUT17|Even if there's no reason for them to exist.
NEUT18|They love to create ETF sold advertising JTS.
NEUT19|Now look should this find out some quality companies that can pass this space place.
NEUT20|They've got Trimble craters, defense L3 Harris so something like L3 is mainly a high defense contractor.
NEUT21|We have more you got Lockheed Martin and Boeing which Jews have some space exposure, even if it's not their main business.
NEUT22|The thing is, this fund also includes Amazon.
NEUT23|Alphabet.
NEUT24|And Netflix, along with some Chinese e-commerceplacejd.com, Alibaba, Tencent Deers in there too.
NEUT25|Yeah, Deere Tractor Company, it's ridiculous, but there aren't enough genuine space related stocks.
NEUT26|Making decent ETF and the manager wants to collect that .75% expense ratio.
NEUT27|Maybe?
NEUT28|I don't get don't launch space ETF if you have to pad it out with Netflix and Dear, you know what?
NEUT29|I was surprised that GameStop isn't it because GameStop is synonymous with rocket ships over at Wallstreetbets.
NEUT30|Yeah, well it's not this or look at the ridiculous amount of risk the banks exposed themselves to with with this archegos hedge fund.
NEUT31|You know what that's about?
NEUT32|That's about greed.
BEAR33|The industry might have lost $10 billion here, and we know they were avoidable.
NEUT34|Why?
NEUT35|Because this funded not ensnare everybody.
BULL36|JP Morgan considered working with them and passed.
NEUT37|They exercise something.
NEUT38|I've been searching for this word all day 'cause there's not really available anymore on Wall Street judgment.
BEAR39|Something is in very short supply and they decided this phone wasn't worth the risk.
NEUT40|They didn't trust Arculus they didn't trust it.
BEAR41|Everyone else chased those commissions with Moore and Credit Suisse getting hit particularly hard because they were so desperate to show that they are the go to banks for hedge funds that need absurd amounts of leverage.
