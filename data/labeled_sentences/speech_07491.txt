NEUT0|"""Whether you love crypt or not."
NEUT1|Blockchain technology is the future and like in every new movement it creates an opportunity for early investors to profit massive gains.
NEUT2|In this video I will show you a cryptocurrency that the average person probably hasn't even heard of.
NEUT3|Ve Chain, also known by its ticker symbol V ET.
NEUT4|If you're new here I cover different hot crypto currencies, different stocks and other investments have a huge potential to skyrocket, so hit the subscribe button for that.
NEUT5|With that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT6|Let's talk money.
NEUT7|Feat chain has probably gone under the radar, but it's been around for awhile as it was launched in 2015.
NEUT8|It's also by no means a small or relevant coin.
NEUT9|Out of the more than 6000 different cryptocurrencies that are currently in circulation be chain ranks 20th in terms of market cap, the maximum supply of each chain is capped at about 86 billion coins.
NEUT10|Currently is estimated at about 64 billion coins.
NEUT11|In other words, 74% of the maximum supply is in circulation.
NEUT12|Each of these coins is trading around 6.2 cents, so it's pretty inexpensive to earn a lot of coins.
NEUT13|So what is beaching good for anyways?
NEUT14|The chain is actually not a currency that's a blockchain platform that is assigned to enhance supply chain management and business processes.
NEUT15|Its goal is to streamline these processes and information flow for complex supply chains through the use of distributed Ledger technology, also known as DLT, the Vechain platform, as two tokens Vechain token, also known as VT&V Chandora Energy, also known as VTHOVT, is used to transfer value across the chains network.
NEUT16|And VTHO is used as energy or gas to power transactions.
NEUT17|Vechain is a pretty revolutionary project as it gives the users control over the authenticity of the product in the supply chain from when a good is produced.
NEUT18|Until the timer reaches the hands of the customer, the good is exchanged between many parties.
NEUT19|Current systems require trust between those hands that the product that is being exchanged is authentic and there is no switching or temporary in the supply chain.
BEAR20|Producers and consumers suffer in any loss of billions of dollars because of tampering.
NEUT21|With Vechain, all this can be solved if products have a smartship or QR code which you can track, there's no way that the authentic product gets lost somewhere in the supply chain and then the user gets a fake product.
BEAR22|As we discussed earlier, the chain is currently trading around 6.2 cents, which is less than a 2% from its all time high of 6.3 cents.
BULL23|However, there is still a lot of room for growth.
BEAR24|Turning 2020 feature was consistently training under $0.02 today as more than tripled.
NEUT25|Look at Cardano's an example not that long ago it was trained at similar price to Vechain.
BEAR26|Today, Cardano's Price is well past $1.00.
NEUT27|"I think the chicken do something somewhere in 2021 and this revolutionary coin has a lot of room to run still."""
