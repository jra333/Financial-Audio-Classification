BULL0|"""Earnings just in from NBC Universal parent, Comcast adjusted quarterly profit, came in at $0.65 a share that beat consensus by 13 cents."
BULL1|Revenue also exceeded Wall Street forecasts and.
NEUT2|This is a fascinating report because it's so multifaceted and the I guess the bright spot for the company continues to be this focus on broadband and and how well broadband is actually doing.
BULL3|In fact, because of broadband, the company was able to add 600 and 33,000 customers, which brings the number of new customer relationships to Annette 556.
NEUT4|So you know, all these companies like Comcast or dealing with cord cutting and everything else.
NEUT5|But when you've got sort of a broadband base to back things up.
NEUT6|That goes a long way and it would allow a long way in these numbers if you want to look for you guys, see the theme park business and it.
BEAR7|I mean, it pains me to see that, but that's why most of these results are down from a year ago.
BULL8|Even though a lot of the parts of the company doing really, really well.
BEAR9|But when theme parks go down, I mean the numbers are really kind of staggering, but they really aren't staggering because they're closed or at least their reopening with not a whole lot of people back there had been closed.
NEUT10|Now the reopening so and then actually you look at NBC Universal.
BEAR11|There's, you know we had the sports coverage and there were other set back, but I'd say dealing pretty well with everything even though revenue at NBC Universal total was down 18.9%.
BEAR12|But that obviously includes the theme parks where revenue is down 80.9 percent.
BEAR13|80.9% Universal Studios was tough, tough too.
NEUT14|I mean, think about it, the Universal Studios you can't go see a movie?
NEUT15|Really in a theater.
NEUT16|Go ahead back, sorry.
NEUT17|Joe, I was just going to say on your point about the theme parks.
NEUT18|They say excluding that segment that we are 9%.
BULL19|Yeah, we've grown by 9%.
BULL20|For EBIT, die year over year, and that's pretty impressive.
BULL21|But even the way it is, I think most of the metrics are pretty solid for all in terms of of beating expectations anyway.
NEUT22|Most year over year when you have theme parks, movies and things like that, it's not going to be up year over year.
BEAR23|So the stock at this point you've seen it's come down a little bit.
BULL24|It was down yesterday, obviously in the day before, but it's up a little bit today up about .6%.
NEUT25|And there are people who are going through this.
NEUT26|Right now, obviously Peacock had a pretty good look at this big deal.
NEUT27|The way that the the way that it's.
NEUT28|You know it's it's together with Xfinity and I would say you know, and I've been on a few times.
NEUT29|You guys get it.
NEUT30|You guys are on it once in awhile.
NEUT31|I've noted that I don't mind if I know I have a minute.
NEUT32|It's only a minute of my life.
NEUT33|I don't feel that bad.
NEUT34|I kind of like the commercials.
NEUT35|Seeing him once in awhile and a little thing at the bottom.
NEUT36|Go ahead.
NEUT37|22 million.
BULL38|Yeah, still trying to sign up.
BULL39|They recently, as you know, Secure District distribution on Roku, but what's interesting is they exceeded every internal engagement metric on Peacock without the benefit of the Olympics, which have been postponed and without the benefit of the office, which they'll be getting in January of 2021.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
