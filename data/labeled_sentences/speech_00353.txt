NEUT0|"""All right, welcome back to the channel."
NEUT1|Everyone at today we're going to be covering the Rolls Royce stock ticker symbol RYCEY.
NEUT2|I'm going to be covering the major news that came out of Rolls Royce this week as well as their technical analysis and their charts as well as some key support and resistance levels that you guys want to be watching for him.
NEUT3|So you guys want to make sure to watch until the very end of this video.
NEUT4|So there were two main announcements that came out of Rolls Royce in the past week but before we get into that please go ahead and subscribe with the notification Bell on if you guys haven't already.
NEUT5|I make stock videos weekly talking about the top stocks.
NEUT6|Going into 2021 so you guys don't wanna miss out on that.
NEUT7|With that being said, let's get started just three days ago.
BEAR8|There was a new chief Financial officer appointed which had been expected since the previous CFO announced that he would be leaving along with the company's interim results last year, right after the new CFO is appointed, the stock soared Anahita Weekly.
BULL9|Hi Rose Royce also announced yesterday a total care agreement with Uganda Airlines for their two new Airbus A330 NEO aircraft powered exclusively by Rolls Royce Trent 7000.
NEUT10|Engine's with all that being said, let's take a look at the technical analysis and the predictions for the Rolls Royce stock in the next coming days.
NEUT11|As well, some of the support and resistance levels that you guys should be watching off work right?
NEUT12|So this is the Rolls Royce charts.
NEUT13|For the past couple of days, as you guys can see right here, this is around the same time that the Chief Financial Officer was appointed and the stock was worth about $1.35 and then it climbed all the way up to $1.57 that same day.
NEUT14|And as you guys can see right here at this is currently what it's worth right now, $1.43.
NEUT15|So I'm going to be showing you guys some of the support and resistance levels that you guys should be watching for.
BULL16|So we had a support level right about here on the 17th and that has now turned into the new resistance level.
NEUT17|So that means that $1.46 is a point that you guys want to be watching very closely because there's going to be a lot of action going on around that point.
NEUT18|As you guys already know, any movements that you're seeing with the candle sticks is only influenced by the big buyers such as the hedge funds and the banks.
NEUT19|So if we continually see $1.46 a support or resistance level, this is going to mean that this is an important point that you guys want to be watching.
NEUT20|There's going to be a lot of action happening at $1.46.
BULL21|This support level will be out $1.36 because the stock has bounced off that point multiple times as you guys can see right here, it bounced off that point around like 6 times, so that's going to be a good support level right there so you guys can see right here.
BEAR22|The stock is actually struggling to breakthrough that $1.46 mark, so you guys want to be watching that $1.46 mark if the stock does breakthrough $1.46, then that's going to be a sign that it's a good time to buy it, because the big buyers are very bullish.
NEUT23|On it, so as you guys can see right here with the RSI levels historically, whenever the RSI has been around 30, it's been a good time to buy.
NEUT24|So right here you guys can see the RSI was at 34 and under stock.
BULL25|Ended up having a huge gain and then it climbed all the way from $1.39 all the way up to $1.45.
BULL26|So that was a good time to buy in as you guys can see over here.
BEAR27|On the flip side of that, when the RSI was at around 70 M and that the stock was overbought and it was a good time to sell so that's why the stock had a huge downfall over here.
NEUT28|So those are my key support and resistance levels that I'm going to be watching for the next couple of days with the Rolls Royce stock.
BULL29|I hope this video helped you guys out.
