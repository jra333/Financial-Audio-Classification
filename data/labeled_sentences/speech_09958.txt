BULL0|"""Hi, welcome back to financial journey."
NEUT1|My name is Cole so today we're bringing it back all the way to 2018 and talking about Helios and Matheson tickers.
NEUT2|Hmm, why so?
NEUT3|They had a movie subscription service that you would pay a fee, get unlimited movies.
NEUT4|It was obviously too good to be true.
NEUT5|I even invested in it way back when, but turns out they're back from the dead.
NEUT6|Well, possibly, so we're going to talk about a little bit about that, but I'm going to do is smash the thumbs up and subscribe if you're not already.
NEUT7|I'm trying to hit 800 subscribers, so definitely if you like the content, subscribe like Smash the like better, but let me know in the comments below what you think about HM and Y as well an whether you actually traded it before, but let's kiss.
NEUT8|So there's an article that came out today that brought light to moviepass.com.
BEAR9|It was actually very interesting so it had the same general website info message from the CEO saying that obviously it was suspended and whatnot, but there was a countdown that was added that is set to expire.
NEUT10|March 22nd doesn't indicate what but it just says the movie is Botox start?
NEUT11|Other than that.
NEUT12|That is it.
BEAR13|That is actually what is causing hmm Y to go up roughly.
NEUT14|I think it's about close to 100% hundred and 6% right now.
NEUT15|So yeah, it is causing a lot of speculation and probably will cause a lot of speculation going up till March 22nd.
NEUT16|So in my opinion it's definitely it's one of those things.
NEUT17|Risk.
NEUT18|First, reward is definitely a good lottery play, especially considering it gives a deadline and up until then anyone could be guessing there.
NEUT19|I'm sure in the coming days there's going to be lots of speculation.
NEUT20|Obviously Helios and Matheson was a huge kind of traded stock.
NEUT21|Everyone I know seems to have traded it.
NEUT22|So is kind of bringing the past back a little bit, so I'm sure a lot of people are going to be very incentivized to actually trade it.
BULL23|An invest in it, causing it to go up even further.
NEUT24|So again, I probably even in my opinion, I will probably invest in it because again, small amount risk versus reward is probably there.
BULL25|Then up until March 22nd, who knows it could go up even further alot and now it's a 200 percent 171% so.
NEUT26|As just talking you, yeah, it's insane.
NEUT27|So again, this is one of those things that I highly probably suggest that looking at putting on your watchlist or just putting in a small bid and then seeing where it goes, but let me know in the comments below what you think about Helios and Matheson.
NEUT28|"Again, whether you actually invested or whatnot, don't forget to hit subscribe, Smash that thumbs up, but thanks for watching."""
