NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Also from disclosure standpoint, I do own Apple from the long side in my retirement accounts.
NEUT4|Well crazy crazy final 30 minutes of the day and now that I think about it, it's Friday, so crazy final 30 minutes of the week.
NEUT5|But check out that candle right there and then.
NEUT6|You look at the volume that came pouring in and this was the biggest volume that this thing has had for the past few days.
BEAR7|Price all over the place.
NEUT8|Although from the big picture or I should say bigger picture point of view.
NEUT9|I mean nothing really happened today.
NEUT10|What do I mean by that?
NEUT11|Well, for those who have been watching the past videos I've been talking about a couple of key levels.
NEUT12|First area up here at 508 that Red line was never even tested today.
NEUT13|The other level of support which I've been talking about down here at.
NEUT14|496 wasn't even tested today, so there's no doubt about it that this final 30 minutes was absolutely crazy, but it was all the craziness that's still just happened within the sideways channel pattern.
NEUT15|Now, could that be a leading indicator that maybe some sort of breakdown of the pattern is coming?
NEUT16|Yeah, I would say that that's of course not.
NEUT17|No, not a guarantee.
NEUT18|Guarantees don't exist, but is that is that at least a valid irrational premise to have?
NEUT19|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT20|So I don't blame people at all.
NEUT21|I don't think they're crazy.
NEUT22|In fact, makes me very curious about 496 going forward next week.
NEUT23|Meaning if the price.
NEUT24|Comes down here and breaks down through there again.
NEUT25|Not a guarantee, but that could create quite a bit of downside selling pressure and it seems logical that that could potentially happen given just how crazy this all was.
NEUT26|But again, taking a step back and you know, removing yourself from the final 30 minutes of craziness, then the overall chart the you know, the price is still just sitting between those two sideways areas.
NEUT27|But these are levels that a lot of traders will be watching so called a self filling prophecy.
NEUT28|Carter if you want when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing.
NEUT29|I mean, it can certainly produce some very dynamic movements.
BULL30|And right now, yeah, 496 looks like a potential valid.
NEUT31|You know, opportunity there from the short side for those people that you know, play that side of the market.
NEUT32|If the price does break down below there.
NEUT33|But then again, it's apples.
NEUT34|Who knows, maybe this thing will just recovers.
NEUT35|They just kidding and then blast up through 508.
NEUT36|So we'll have to see what happens with the next week.
NEUT37|But those are definitely the two main levels to keep an eye on.
NEUT38|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT39|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT40|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL41|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT42|The first key is super weird.
NEUT43|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT44|But in a cruel way.
BEAR45|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT46|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT47|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT48|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT49|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT50|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.

NEUT52|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
