NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Mike Cintolo, editor of Cabot Market Letter and Cabot Top ten report."
NEUT1|And I'm here with your Cabot weekly review.
BULL2|It was another good week for the markets and for most leading stocks.
BEAR3|But volatility has picked up underneath the surface during earnings season as we expected.
NEUT4|So I want to spend a few minutes today talking about earnings reactions from individual stocks and what they portend for the future.
NEUT5|As with most things in the market.
NEUT6|You know up is good and down is bad, but knowing a little your way around a chart can help you make the most of earnings season as we take a look at the chart here.
NEUT7|Here's Tupperware brands TUP.
NEUT8|This is not the normal stock I'd look at, but notice how it had a nice pattern here.
NEUT9|Multi month base.
BULL10|It hasn't been a leader on this advance yet, but on earnings it did pop out of there on big volume.
NEUT11|This is the most high probability pattern during earnings season is a big long base.
BULL12|A big volume breakout on earnings.
NEUT13|It's usually telling you that the stock is ready for a new sustained advance.
NEUT14|And you can buy it as soon as it's gapping out there to new highs on the earnings report.
NEUT15|Of course, the markets been super strong, so you're not going to get a lot of multi month basis.
BULL16|You're going to get a lot of things more like a tempurpedic TP X, which has been very strong.
BULL17|But you did get some tightness here.
NEUT18|You got about 4-5 weeks of consolidation between basically 2932 and then you get the big volume breakout again you can.
NEUT19|But when you see this and you get the big volume breakout that morning or that afternoon, you can really just buy it right away.
NEUT20|Some other examples would be a VM Ware.
BULL21|Again, you know a nice uptrend, some tightness for about four weeks.
NEUT22|This one actually broke out a little bit before the earnings, but notice how it came right back down.
BULL23|Ahead of the report and then it thrusted higher, just a couple of days ago.
NEUT24|Something that's similar but a little bit different though is F5 networks.
NEUT25|Again, you're not seeing many long consolidation so you're trying to find just areas of tightness and not much trading.
BEAR26|You know, just quiet volume and for the most part here F5 from 62 to 66 for about four or five weeks before the big earnings move yesterday.
NEUT27|So these are the highest probability patterns you all are going to come across the occasional Netflix which you know this one broke out three months ago, hasn't really had any consolidation here.
BEAR28|In fact, it accelerated into the report and then had a huge gap on earnings.
NEUT29|You know, if you own this, you can maybe sell a little bit, but you can still hold on to most of your position because it was such a powerful move.
NEUT30|However, you know this is just a lower probability by point, and in this situation.
NEUT31|What I like to do is just wait a few days and see if the stock and just sort of tighten up.
NEUT32|Maybe pulls back a little bit and you get some small daily ranges and maybe a week or two from now.
BULL33|It does offer a goodbye point at some of these moving averages catch up.
NEUT34|OK, so you want to be looking for ideally 5-6 week consolidations or longer with the big earnings gaps.
NEUT35|On the downside, I just want to mention one thing.
NEUT36|This is why it's important to use charts.
BEAR37|OK, if you get a big earnings gap down below the 50 day moving average, that's that's one thing.
NEUT38|OK, that's telling you that the.
BULL39|The uptrend is over for now, but here's CRCR E and this Red Day right here was its reaction earnings and it might look well contained.
NEUT40|But trust me, you know 7 or 8% on the downside, big volume and the question.
NEUT41|We got a lot of questions saying should you sell it and the answer is no because it's still in an uptrend.
NEUT42|OK?
NEUT43|I mean it wasn't even down to its 25 day short term.
NEUT44|25 day moving average which is this thin red line and you can see the result in a strong bull market.
BULL45|The stock had a little bit of a shake the next morning but then powered back up to within just a couple percent of a tie.
NEUT46|On big volume.
NEUT47|OK, so basically you don't want to just get two.
BULL48|You know caught up and hey it's up 5% on earnings it down.
BEAR49|That's good, it's down 5% on earnings.
BEAR50|That's bad.
NEUT51|You do want to interpret the chart as well, and in this case you would save you from getting shaken out, at least for now.
NEUT52|That's all the time we have for today.
BULL53|Thanks for listening.
NEUT54|"Please join us again next week for another Cabot Weekly review."""
