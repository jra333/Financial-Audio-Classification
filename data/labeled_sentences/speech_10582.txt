NEUT0|"""Jim, this morning on Twitter you definitely taken note of the inverse correlation between technology and rates."
NEUT1|So painful I think I was watching Franklin this morning in the section 55 o'clock and what was incredible was we didn't have this.
NEUT2|We didn't have the bonds doing anything at that hour and everything looked fine.
NEUT3|It was just all hunky Dory.
NEUT4|Who knew maybe this was the update Apple was looking up, and then the interest rates they kick up and just the linkages so clear.
NEUT5|David often talks about the algorithms.
NEUT6|It really doesn't even matter what.
NEUT7|What NASDAQ stock were talking about?
NEUT8|It goes down and when we see this and David, I know you're celebrating Saint Patrick's Day, which is really great to see.
NEUT9|But this linkage is just extraordinary, isn't it?
NEUT10|I mean, how lockstep it is?
NEUT11|It is right now.
NEUT12|You know what breaks it, Jim.
NEUT13|What what takes it off?
BULL14|Because it's not as though this is not also pointing to what is going to be very significant growth, which you could argue is going to be a positive for many companies, even with the prospect of some inflation.
NEUT15|Look I had Dow Chemical on this night.
NEUT16|Jim fitterling.
NEUT17|I mean look at last year the stock was at 22.
NEUT18|He did buy $2,000,000 worth in the open market came on the show to talk about it.
NEUT19|Yeah, all of their products.
BULL20|The prices are going up now.
NEUT21|Some of that is is we had not talked enough about you re which is a storm that was so concentrated in the areas where plastics are made but but call if you would if I were in the room asking Jay Pal I would say there is not a commodity other than cocoa that isn't going up huge what?
NEUT22|Are you going to do about it and then he has to do the dance quarrel he is to say a family as a short term, but can he back that up with any facts?
NEUT23|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT24|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
