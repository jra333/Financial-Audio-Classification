BULL0|"""Bill Gates thinks that this stock that trades for just $1.00 will rise by over 1000%."
BULL1|Chima thinks that this stock will rise by 2000%.
NEUT2|This stock will make you 10X.
NEUT3|Yes, these are actual videos made by other Youtubers, mainly to me they look like pump and dump schemes.
NEUT4|It's ironic that I also have similar titles for some of my videos, but the difference is I objectively deconstruct the absurd stock expectations that I see through analysis of the company's business overview.
NEUT5|The market it's in.
NEUT6|Financials and competitive advantages and most of the companies have looked at wildly unprofitable and have a huge amount of speculation attached to their predictions, but not this one.
NEUT7|This one is actually a quality company.
NEUT8|All that I ask for in return is to subscribe to join our growing community of people passionate about investing and remember none of this is financial advice.
NEUT9|In this video will be doing a deep dive of the railroad industry.
NEUT10|Through the lens of Canada National Railway code.
NEUT11|Ticker symbols.
NEUT12|CN I.
NEUT13|And when we combine all of Bill Gates investment portfolios, he owns at least 16% of the total company.
NEUT14|Railroads are generally quality business.
NEUT15|However, this doesn't mean it's worth buying.
NEUT16|In the end.
NEUT17|It depends on how its intrinsic value is relative to the purchase price.
BEAR18|The railroad business has a very very steep barrier for entry, which really prevents new entrants from entering the market.
BULL19|Helping already established companies like Canada National retain their market share.
NEUT20|And compound overtime.
BEAR21|Replacing hundreds of years of existing railroad infrastructure is no easy feat, and creating railroads which overlap with existing infrastructure will already diminish the margins for both companies.
BULL22|As such, this is a strong competitive advantage that minimizes the risk in investing in these businesses.
BULL23|Furthermore, the infrastructure has been designed in such a way to minimize overlap, allowing each major company to enjoy its share of profits.
NEUT24|The unique geographical areas.
BULL25|And this is especially true for Canada national in terms of future proofing in the Environmental Sense, Railroad transport is much more greenhouse gas efficient than other forms of transport, and that's always an added benefit.
BULL26|These major railways already exist and don't have much competition, so increasing the growth in traffic as well as the efficiency of the railroad supply chain will directly transfer into higher margins and returns.
BULL27|Future advancements may also come.
BULL28|In the form of optimizing the business through the use of AI to maximize profitability and all of these competitive advantages I've listed will lead to greater profits for us as investors.
NEUT29|However, despite the fact that the railroad business is the quality industry to invest in, it doesn't mean that we should invest now or even in the future.
NEUT30|Our returns and risk are a function of the price we invest at, and as such we need to be sure that we are investing at a fair price with an added margin of safety.
BEAR31|And this company, looking at the growth rate in earnings per share using a discounted cash flow model, looks a bit overvalued.
BULL32|Or at least not as undervalued as I would like.
BULL33|However, I like the industry, and I love the competitive advantages that we discussed above.
BULL34|"An if there are changes to the stock price that make it undervalued in the near future, I will definitely consider adding some to My Portfolio."""
