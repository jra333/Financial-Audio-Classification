NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
BEAR1|We can see Apple has opened negative and kept.
NEUT2|All the way until the closing of the market, but it's a little bit higher than the.
NEUT3|Middle of the day.
NEUT4|If you change the chart into daily chart.
NEUT5|We can see here we got a.
NEUT6|Red Dodge so this story has a long lower tail that means a lot of buying power from underneath, and also this kind of the law is a little bit higher than yesterday.
BULL7|So that means we still got some buying power.
BEAR8|After the yesterday's drop.
NEUT9|So if we checked.
NEUT10|Volume we can see the volume is not to hide.
NEUT11|That means selling and buying.
BEAR12|Still weak in my opinion we have falling back to this point because if we draw a line from here we'll see.
NEUT13|Actually this is the breakout and then all the candles had been above this line.
BEAR14|But unfortunately from yesterday and today.
BULL15|We have been.
NEUT16|Below drop below this area because he lives here.
BULL17|But we closed back up again to this level.
NEUT18|So in in this scenario, I think Apple should find a consolidation station area between.
NEUT19|This point.
BULL20|And at the high point here.
BEAR21|So this is a new trading range, but from the volume I can see there's no institution interest here, so it will unlikely for Apple stock to go back up too quickly from here.
NEUT22|I think it needs a consolidation.
BULL23|"Thank you."""
