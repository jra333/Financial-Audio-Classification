BULL0|"""So this happens at this time every year, investors and particularly the Business Media, start to look ahead in terms of private companies going public and despite the volatility that we've seen recently, you've got executives on Wall Street saying actually, that might accelerate plans for private companies to go public."
NEUT1|So in 2019, I mean some of the best known names Erin Uber Slack, Airbnb, Lyft.
NEUT2|Is there one that you're either really hoping?
NEUT3|Goes public, or you're just eager to get your hands on the S1 filing.
NEUT4|I hope Stripe goes public, sooner or later.
NEUT5|It might not IPO this year, but there a payment platform that makes it super easy for companies to sell things online.
BULL6|Their developer tools are known to be excellent.
BULL7|They continue to roll out new solutions.
NEUT8|The founder and CEO, Patrick Wilson, seems to be super thoughtful and it wouldn't surprise me one day.
NEUT9|Just because this market is so big.
NEUT10|Buying things online that Stripe becomes a larger payments company than PayPal one day.
NEUT11|An I think that's super fascinating.
NEUT12|Right now they have a market cap about 20 billion, so I would love for them to go public sooner than later before they start hitting the upper 10s of billions in their valuation.
NEUT13|Do you think they're at the point now where their way past the acquisition standpoint?
NEUT14|It would be a big acquisition.
NEUT15|Doubt it would happen at least from another payments company, so I bet they'll they'll go solo public.
NEUT16|Maddie.
NEUT17|What are you eager to get your hand for me?
NEUT18|You mentioned it airbeam be my wife and I have actually been Air BNB host for over a decade now and what you have is essentially the world's largest, most expensive hotel company that really doesn't own any of its rooms.
NEUT19|I mean, it's it's fascinating to me.
NEUT20|It has somewhere on the order of 5,000,000 listings, 150,000,000 users in close to 200 countries.
NEUT21|It has a profound network effect maybe.
BULL22|Maybe actually the strongest in the world.
NEUT23|I think.
NEUT24|I think we're going to realize that, and you know, I don't really know what the market cap is going to be when it becomes public, but just in terms of room count and customer count, it's bigger than all the major publicly traded hotel companies combined.
NEUT25|OK, I really wasn't expecting that at the end.
BULL26|"I'm assuming the answer is yes, but you got a good rating like what kind of rating we did from you, like almost five star rating across our our listing, so I'm not surprised but I'm very pleased for you."""
