BULL0|"""Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a great day."
NEUT1|If you're new here.
NEUT2|Welcome to market craze.
NEUT3|My name is Steven.
NEUT4|If you're returning member, welcome back so we're going to talk about Nokia again today.
NEUT5|Nokia is apparently a leader in the 5G networks and Nokia is kind of kind of fighting to get past $5.
NEUT6|Kind of is what I say, and I mean that because it is not doing very well.
NEUT7|But I'm gonna go ahead and give Nokia the benefit of the doubt because Nokia has been through the wringer recently, you know?
NEUT8|They were a target from Robin Hood and all these other companies and brokerages that were saying, hey guys, we're not going to let you trade this anymore.
NEUT9|You guys are manipulating the market whatever.
NEUT10|So yeah, I I get it.
BEAR11|Nokia hit $8.00 and then it kind of dropped and it's been kind of dropping and dropping and dropping.
BEAR12|It went back up yesterday but now it's back down to $4.50 as of right now I still side with what I said yesterday that Nokia is a very long term hold.
NEUT13|Again, I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT14|Please do not just listen to me and me only.
NEUT15|I'm just some guy on YouTube that likes the stock market and likes talking about stocks.
NEUT16|Don't listen to me only but I think Nokia down the line could be a huge player in the 5G market and could be a huge player, maybe even in the phone market eventually.
NEUT17|Again, this is a bit of a risky investment.
NEUT18|An honestly began handle that please invest in index funds.
NEUT19|I'm not a financial advisor by any means, but if you can't handle these hot stocks, dog just.
NEUT20|Invest in some index funds.
NEUT21|It is going to be like I sent a very long hold though and I don't think that this is going to hit $10 tomorrow.
NEUT22|$15 in next day $20 and exit is going to be at least a few months until we see any insane gains from this stock.
NEUT23|But that's most stocks.
NEUT24|Most stocks aren't like GameStop.
BEAR25|I think that deck like GameStop in AMC gave a lot of people the wrong idea of what the stock market is like.
NEUT26|Most stocks with respectable companies.
NEUT27|And that people aren't trying to just pump and dump are actually going to take awhile to get somewhere where it's going to actually be beneficial to you.
NEUT28|And that's kind of a risky thing to play.
NEUT29|If you think that it's going to pay off, and you think that this company is going to really make it for you, then go for it.
NEUT30|But again, you are playing a risk by putting all of your money or putting any money into a company that is not 100% guaranteed to make you a lot of money, but with that being said, I'd like to see what you guys think.
NEUT31|About Nokia in the comment section below.
BEAR32|I hope you guys didn't do this video.
NEUT33|If you like daily stock market updates and you want to stay updated on the stock market in general without doing your own research, go ahead and leave a like comment and subscribe and tell me what you liked about this video etc etc.
BULL34|Hope you guys have a great rest of your day and I hope you guys did alright on AMC today because man that was that was hard to watch personally especially as an investor myself.
NEUT35|"Peace."""
