BEAR0|"""We've all been trying to make sense of of the stock of rocket companies, which is just blown up up 70%."
NEUT1|Obviously there was some short interest in it, but again, the Reddit community comes roaring back.
NEUT2|How do you think this is going to become a feature of the market?
NEUT3|Well, the way that investors used to judge stocks based on fundamentals has really changed recently.
NEUT4|I don't know if this is the new normal yet, but we've seen Reddit posters on the thread wallstreetbets take stocks and bring them to new levels with GameStop.
NEUT5|With AMC with BlackBerry and The Wall Street Journal did an analysis in recent weeks and found that those stocks had hundreds of thousands of posts and were some of the most actively traded.
NEUT6|So I do think this is the beginning of a major change.
BEAR7|And even with Dave.
NEUT8|Portnoy launching his ETF with the ticker buzz to track what's being said on social media, it's bringing up a lot of momentum that you really just can't ignore these days.
NEUT9|OK Joanne manager, dancer don't you think that everything old is new again?
NEUT10|I mean, I'm old enough to remember 2000 and the bubble then and it was then it was all about chat boards and people getting together and and pumping up the value of stocks which then crashed by the way.
NEUT11|So you're 100 to me, you're 100% right.
NEUT12|The question I would ask is Gary Gensler, who just testified yesterday in his hearing for Confirmation, was asked about.
NEUT13|You know how he's going to think about, read it and and the like.
NEUT14|Didn't really have a firm answer.
NEUT15|How do you think he should approach it?
NEUT16|Because there's there's sort of two issues.
NEUT17|On one side, you might say to yourself.
NEUT18|Let's regulate this to protect the small investor on the other side, there seems to be a I don't know.
NEUT19|It's the prevailing view, but a view.
NEUT20|That that that there's there's a freedom in this, both a freedom of speech issue and a freedom to affectively work together as a group.
NEUT21|Which historically the SEC has not allowed.
NEUT22|Right, right?
NEUT23|And you know, I understand the predators.
NEUT24|I understand that the the anger at the professionals understand their Glee and sticking it to the man.
BULL25|But I think Andrew, you've made a really, really good point.
BEAR26|Which is there's very likely professionals on both sides of these short squeezes and an at the end of the day.
BEAR27|I do think that that the day traders are the ones you know, some of them will make out an A lot of them are going to get really hurt so.
NEUT28|I do think actually a big piece of this is education.
NEUT29|A big piece of it is not forgetting history 'cause we have been through similar kind of boom and bust events before where a small investors at the end of the day are the ones who get hurt.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
