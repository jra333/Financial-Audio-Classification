NEUT0|"""Everyone here is your stock in focus."
BULL1|We're looking at Coke and you could see it had a gap down here, but you could see the very big, strong move that you're seeing over the 50 day moving average.
BULL2|A very nice surge here.
NEUT3|This is a lot of times, probably on price is kind of running sideways.
NEUT4|You've gotta really look at what is the trend here.
BULL5|The trend is still up.
NEUT6|You see higher lows, higher highs, and even though you're seeing a gap down you of course you want to be careful here.
NEUT7|But you see this pullback, you see basically a three wave move here, and you'll yes, you'll see some extension and then another.
NEUT8|Correction, and then the five wave.
BULL9|But you could see nice momentum shifting here to the upside.
NEUT10|Very likely continuation, and then what you do is you can go into the weekly and it kind of you know, really kind of clean things up on the longer term as you could see clearly the uptrend is still up regardless of that gap down.
NEUT11|You could see it on the weekly coming into the 50 day moving average.
NEUT12|This is why you're seeing this strength come in.
NEUT13|You also see prices that were really kind of running sideways, not creating new any new highs.
NEUT14|And there was some divergent so.
BULL15|As prices started to break that last top, that kind of changes that scenario, and you're technically in an uptrend, so you're seeing prices rally back.
BULL16|"You should see it come into then probably 4546 range as it continues to drive higher."""
