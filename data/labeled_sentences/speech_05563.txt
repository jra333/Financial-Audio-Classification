NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Ted 10 half Piper Sandler senior research analyst Anan."
NEUT1|With Moderna I mean with Pfizer, it was obviously a huge deal with Moderna.
NEUT2|It's even more extraordinary in some ways because they've never had a product before.
NEUT3|Commercial product or revenues, and this is their first shot out of the gate had are they ready?
NEUT4|I think they are.
NEUT5|And you're right, you always expect fighters.
NEUT6|The biggest pharmaceutical company on the globe.
NEUT7|So you know who is Moderna at the start of this.
NEUT8|I don't think anyone knew who Moderna was now.
NEUT9|It's a household name and I have to be honest.
BULL10|The companies really risen to the challenge they've put in place.
BULL11|Really important relationships with manufacturers they've been assisted by the government and they've delivered a really robust phase three trial.
NEUT12|The briefing documents mentioned were out this morning and the FDA will be reviewing there.
NEUT13|Vaccine for Emergency use authorization on Thursday.
NEUT14|Do you expect Ed both Moderna and Pfizer's vaccine to be as hard or as easy to roll out as each other?
NEUT15|So actually they are very similar vaccines.
NEUT16|They're based on similar technology.
BULL17|Modernist does have a slight advantage in terms of its stability, which means that it can actually be refrigerated at a normal normal refrigerator temperature for seven days and is stable throughout the day, so you know there are challenges with this logistical issues, but obviously the vaccines so good we're going to need to get everybody vaccinated.
NEUT18|One thing to keep in mind, it does require two vaccinations, so that's an extra logistical hurdle.
NEUT19|But we think this is all over come over.
NEUT20|Finally, Ted, what do you do with the stock moderna's already had such a such an incredible run up?
NEUT21|Are you still buyer is a great question.
BULL22|We are still buyers of Moderna and the important thing about the Covid vaccine, not just the revenues and the profitability that it brings in the short term, but it really rolls forward the whole entire pipeline.
NEUT23|They've got 20 products in development, including other vaccines on the same technology and other diseases for cancer and orphan diseases.
NEUT24|Other products.
BULL25|And all of this is now validated by what they've been able to do with Covid, so we see the opportunity for this company for Moderna to deliver multiple products over the next decade.
NEUT26|To attend to.
BULL27|Thanks so much for joining us.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
