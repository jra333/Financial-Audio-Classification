NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of alumina is range between $9.06 per share and $47.38 per share."
NEUT1|How are those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $9.06 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $9.06 in cash and cash equivalents paying $47.38 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings.
NEUT4|So price of 4738 represents the fractional payment.
NEUT5|We don't have to pay for the company's next 20 years of meeting historical earnings.
NEUT6|Now my next question is what do they do and what are they trading at?
NEUT7|Zero Illuminus a super cool company.
NEUT8|Actually they are in the business of analyzing genetic variation and biological function and this is through the science of integrated systems, which is incredibly fascinating.
NEUT9|What's not fascinating is the share price of 305 with $0.69 PE ratio supports the idea that they are overpriced as well.
NEUT10|It's huge at 71.
NEUT11|9 So we wouldn't wait.
NEUT12|Of course we would invest.
BEAR13|We would wait until the share price of 305 sixty nine comes down beneath $47.38.
NEUT14|Now this is barring changes in the 10K we want to update our numbers here.
NEUT15|But keep in mind I used 10 year trailing for all these numbers so it wouldn't change things that much, but you still update it if it's been some time since I published this video and you're watching it in the future, you'd want to just check your math.
NEUT16|So if we're not going to invest in them, well, we're going to invest in the Vanguard 500 index fund, 'cause I don't want to leave you guys out to dry.
BULL17|I want to provide an alternative that offers a similar return with lower risk in most cases, and it also ensures that your principle is safe and you have an ample margin of that safety.
NEUT18|So I like this fun because Warren Buffett use it to beat out the hedge fund guys in 08 through 18 at 12.98% return over the trailing 10 years.
NEUT19|So I would invest in this.
NEUT20|Until alumina starts trading at a more reasonable, reasonable price, guys have you gotten evaluated this video?
