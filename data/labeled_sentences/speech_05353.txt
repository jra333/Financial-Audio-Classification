NEUT0|"""Anyway, hello everybody, today we're gonna be talking about Nano Dimensions now."
NEUT1|This company is very interesting to me and it's also one that I see potentially becoming one of the bigger ones further down the line, mainly due to his multi layered 3D printing company's point.
NEUT2|Horribly, there is anything quite like it on the market is right now the main line printers that we see for the 3D printing things that just your basic bare bone ones and not this type of multi layer 3D printer.
NEUT3|Anyway hello are very invested trainers and people online.
NEUT4|Welcome back and if you're new around here, welcome to craziness dogs.
NEUT5|I'm your host crazy.
NEUT6|I make stock videos daily, sewed.
NEUT7|Highly appreciate that you guys were new around here to subscribe and turn on post notifications so you don't miss the next line said earlier today we're gonna be talking about Nano Dimension Now.
NEUT8|Nano Dimensions is a 3D printing company that focuses on the 3D printing of electronics.
NEUT9|Includes the development of a printer for multi layered circuit boards as well as the development of nano based ink.
NEUT10|Ignores.
NEUT11|You just want the sounds of those few things there.
NEUT12|I believe this is a really cool thing.
NEUT13|It'll just think even right down there sitting at a $14.00 per share.
NEUT14|Definitely do see these guys going up and stock price.
NEUT15|They keep up with their current.
BULL16|They do it over the past five days they've gone off around 5.82%, which is pretty nice.
BULL17|Gains for a company of this size over the past month, they've gone up around 59%, which again is nice and healthy gains for a stock over the past six months there's been a 585% gain on the stock, with it peaking at a nice 691% total gain.
BULL18|Now that is definitely some insane growth over the past several months, so if we take a look at the over the past one year of the current strong, it's gone up at a nice 1000 and.
BULL19|13% Cain's Peaks currently sitting at a 965% gain.
BULL20|So we did go down just a tad, but again, that wasn't really too much in the grand scheme of things, considering that are still growing today, their overall still pretty nice to see anywhere I see this dog rallying up a nice beautiful gain over the next couple of months, leading to the possibility of hitting $20 a share.
NEUT21|But of course that's going to be over the time span of a couple of months as we're probably going to start trading sideways for a little while on this stock as you, as you know, out of game goes, you can't continuously just go up on a stock.
NEUT22|There's always a certain point in time where the stock is.
NEUT23|Come right back down.
BEAR24|Going sideways while still being higher than before, and it definitely go down off the tire horse oppression.
NEUT25|Example of that right now is Tesla, which after its drastic gains over the past couple of years Tesla's just in a bit of a stage where goes up and down, up and down.
NEUT26|We're having no idea whether it wants to be up or whether it wants to be down.
NEUT27|So there is definitely a high possibility that we'll start seeing this type of thing happening with the Nano dimension stock after awhile after this effect starts to wear off.
BULL28|It definitely does look like a stock that has the potential to rocket up an when it starts.
NEUT29|Rock it up.
NEUT30|It's definitely going to be one that you don't want to miss, so I'd love to hear what you guys think about this.
NEUT31|Stock down the comment sections down below.
NEUT32|"That definitely do see some high games coming to this talk very soon after its current sideways pattern, but either way, if you did enjoy this dunk video, make sure to leave a like comment and subscribe and I'll see you guys later in another stock video by."""
