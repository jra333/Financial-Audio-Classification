BULL0|"""Doctor J there he is good to see a doc unusual to be with you Scott."
NEUT1|Well, I know you're looking for Scott.
NEUT2|I know you're looking for some unusual activity instead of unusual that I'm on just the phone.
NEUT3|That's right.
NEUT4|This time it's Qualcomm, Qualcomm.
NEUT5|They're buying the next week out 140 calls.
NEUT6|Scott, that's what the stock right here at like 135 seventy or so one week out they bought 10,000 of these calls very quickly.
BULL7|Now you see the volume moving up towards 12,000 of them.
BEAR8|That's an awful lot.
NEUT9|I love the upside for this stock.
NEUT10|I bought these at the money called Scott, sold some out of the money calls against it.
NEUT11|Second trade.
NEUT12|Take a look at what's going on in Angie's List.
NEUT13|That's what it used to be called.
NEUT14|Now.
NEUT15|It's just Angie, a an GI, but it's a $6 billion company and they're doing a lot of things right.
NEUT16|Apparently?
BULL17|I know loop capital has some upside to 15 or 18 bucks.
BULL18|Something like that, and we see big upside.
NEUT19|Call buying for regular April, not the aprils that I'm sorry.
NEUT20|May 15th, May 15 is even longer.
NEUT21|You got the May 15th out there Scott.
BULL22|I bought those calls that are more or less the at the money and I'm looking for a lot of upside out of this one as people get contractors and look for them on Angie's List, I think that's going to be great for a angithi.
NEUT23|Alright, good stuff.
NEUT24|I farmer Jim real quick to you looking at my screen because I did get a tweet on Qualcomm earlier.
NEUT25|I know you obviously like Johns.
NEUT26|Pick the tweet says I follow Jim.
NEUT27|Into QCOM that's Qualcomm.
BEAR28|Getting killed here.
NEUT29|What to do?
NEUT30|Getting killed.
NEUT31|Oh, come on seriously, if you can't take that's what they say I hear you but an I don't listen I never want anybody I'm not going to minimize anybody's losses.
NEUT32|But for goodness sakes, don't sell.
BULL33|You gotta understand where the stock that could be up 50% over the next 12 months.
BEAR34|Yeah, it might go down 15% from a high set a couple of months ago.
BULL35|That itself was up 100% / 18 months.
NEUT36|So listen with the reward of good returns.
NEUT37|You gotta take the volatility.
NEUT38|Not minimizing your losses, but for goodness sakes.
NEUT39|"Stick with it, OK."""
