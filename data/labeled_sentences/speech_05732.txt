NEUT0|"""Hello everyone Sean say this back."
NEUT1|What happened last week but the real drama drama that really made a huge impact on Wall Street.
NEUT2|On one side you have band of traders led by Reddit traders.
NEUT3|On the other hand side you have people with silk suit and martini lunch crowd called Wall Street.
BEAR4|So there was a huge tussle between individual traders and hedge funds and in that tussle.
BEAR5|Somebody lost money, so there 2.72 Melvin Capital, Melvin Capital loss 53% last month.
NEUT6|So what really happens?
NEUT7|Investors are curious if you have missed out I will do real quick to give you a recap.
NEUT8|Was this a reflection of U.S. stock market?
NEUT9|I would say no.
NEUT10|It was just one example, a classic case study of how individual traders when they team up how they go against.
NEUT11|The hedge funds and the hedge funds were really reeling under the Sun and they were scrambling for liquid ITI question number two people are asking were regulated, did perform the job.
NEUT12|I would say yes the regulators were on the radar.
NEUT13|They knew what was happening and they kept a very close eye on the equity markets that hurt your question.
NEUT14|Was this GameStop a classic study of bubble in making?
NEUT15|I would say yes when everybody is investing without understanding.
NEUT16|What are the fundamentals?
NEUT17|What are the valuations?
NEUT18|World is the forward price.
NEUT19|Outlook and you just don't know what is happening.
NEUT20|It is just like Sean say this investing and chances are gathered hundred other people who are just investing an following shot.
NEUT21|So this is the classic case study of bubble in the making.
NEUT22|The last question.
NEUT23|Are valuations fair or their distorted?
BEAR24|I will say the valuations are distorted and this has been going on for quite some time.
NEUT25|And who is responsible for distortion for being having asset price inflation in the market?
NEUT26|I would say fed since December 2008 for the last 13 years Fed has.
NEUT27|Flooded the market with lot of liquidity so it really entice those investors with excess liquidity to go get a new game in the market.
BEAR28|So for me it was just like a casino going on and when the music will stop this casino many people will get hurt and this this market is heading towards a catastrophe.
BEAR29|And once it hits the catastrophe, it will get ugly and many people might lose their money in the equity market.
NEUT30|That's all for today.
NEUT31|But before I leave this is Financial Times Sunday and if you see the picture it gives you the whole story what's going on and Johnny will give you the picture of Wall Street, the bubble in the making, the epitome of a bubble.
NEUT32|So it gives you the whole idea of what was happening in the market.
NEUT33|See you next time will come up with more videos.
NEUT34|And will keep you up to date of about the markets.
