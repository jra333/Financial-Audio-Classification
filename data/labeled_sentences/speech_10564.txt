BEAR0|"""Cheese board reportedly won't clawback compensation from former CEO Jeff Immelt and other executives this over the company's accounting issues or his use of a corporate backup jet, this after a three year probe into allegations of misconduct at GE, the Wall Street Journal, citing a letter from the law firm hired to run the process, and the letter says the investigation found no evidence to support shareholders claims of fraud and abuse."
NEUT1|Yeah, the only abuse Jim is when you go back and you take a look at what's happened to the stock price over the long term.
NEUT2|We talk a lot about Larry Culp things have gone fairly well under him.
NEUT3|I mean, heck, I even read a story recently that they're going to come up with a new.
NEUT4|Blade for windmills.
NEUT5|It's bigger than one you've ever seen, but that doesn't take away from the 20 year history.
NEUT6|Of course, buying high and selling low just doesn't work when you do it, time and again for large large assets.
NEUT7|No weather be oil, whether it be, by the way that urban accounting we weren't that crazy about long term care policies.
NEUT8|They turned out to be a sub optimal situation.
NEUT9|But David Larry Larry Cope wants to look forward, not look backward and look how well he's doing.
NEUT10|I think that that's one of the great stories here, which is the Culp is getting this thing turned around.
NEUT11|And I know that we can do a donkey Odie about these windmills but they do matter.
BULL12|Yeah this company is in a position to do well.
NEUT13|I never really liked that power division.
BULL14|Suddenly I'm warming up to it.
NEUT15|Yes, they sold the growth of hospital business at the well.
NEUT16|It's called the genomics business, but they kept the MRI business.
BULL17|The aircraft business I think is going to come back big.
BULL18|I think Culp's doing a great job and I look.
NEUT19|I just want him to be able to think forward and not have to worry about thinking backwards.
NEUT20|That doesn't get him anywhere.
NEUT21|I wonder what too Sis thinking about.
NEUT22|Does he have a new sweater?
NEUT23|I don't know.
NEUT24|Wouldn't hurt you.
NEUT25|Cashmere sweater.
NEUT26|Yeah, 2021 sartorially.
NEUT27|He still lacks what I think is what I would call xas Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
