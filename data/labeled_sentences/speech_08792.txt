NEUT0|"""Ladies and gentlemen, it's your boy Ryan Dinse."
NEUT1|And on today's episode we're going to do is we are going to talk about one of my favorite stocks.
NEUT2|One of my favorite dividend stocks.
NEUT3|One of my favorite growth stocks, and that is AbbVie and the thing I like about Abby is it behaves as both a growth stock and dividend stock.
NEUT4|Now let me explain that a lot of times what investors do is they have to make a difficult decision between do I want something that has high growth, like say, Apple or Microsoft?
NEUT5|Or do I want something with a great dividend, you know, say for example, oh, Realty AT&T, those are both companies that have a great dividend, but the growth could be a little bit to be desired.
NEUT6|One of the reasons why I believe that Abby is one of the best stocks that you could possibly buy.
NEUT7|In my opinion, AbbVie may be the number one best stock you could buy as far as dividend stocks go, because it's got a 4.75% dividend yield.
NEUT8|The beauty about AbbVie is it also grows a lot.
NEUT9|When I started buying it, it was below 90.
NEUT10|Now it's at 1:10.
NEUT11|I give it a price target of about 1:30 ish.
NEUT12|I think in a year from now it'll be 1:30, but the beauty of it is during that year you don't just sit on it looking into Goro.
NEUT13|Hope it goes to 1:30.
NEUT14|No, you're gonna get 5% dividends each year.
NEUT15|This is one of the top three stocks in My Portfolio.
NEUT16|I have a large position of it in comparison to other things.
NEUT17|It's about 12% of my entire portfolio, which I don't even like having anything over 10%.
NEUT18|The problem with Abby is every single week I want to buy more until it's at 1:20.
NEUT19|I'm going to keep buying.
NEUT20|'cause I think it's going to 1:30.
NEUT21|It's gotta P ratio about 19, which is really good considering the pharmaceutical sector, the average peas around 50.
NEUT22|So you know there's a lot of speculative stocks that money's been getting pumped to.
BULL23|An obvious been a little slow.
BEAR24|They got really hit during that whole coronavirus sell off.
BULL25|That happened about a year ago and they've just recovered really nicely.
NEUT26|Fortunately, I've been buying a little bit less a few months ago.
NEUT27|I thought a good price target would be 110, so I kind of stopped by and I thought it was a little overbought, but then I researched more into it.
NEUT28|They're just moving at the speed of light they have.
NEUT29|Humira, which is a huge drug.
NEUT30|It makes up for about 40% of the profits of other products that they constantly come out with.
BULL31|Their constantly innovating or constantly growing and just that dividend alone is so good 4.75% they continue to grow their dividends every single year.
NEUT32|You can count on the dividend raises for them 'cause they be consistent.
BULL33|That's why I think Abby is a great stock in my opinion.
BULL34|If you are looking for a passive dividend growth stock, I think it's one of the best because like I said, Apple and Microsoft might be better for the growth because they grow extremely fast, but then.
NEUT35|Dividend people might like the AT&T type stocks with the 7% dividends.
BULL36|This is right in the middle, doesn't have a bad dividend and it's one of the best dividend stocks in the world.
NEUT37|I think that's all I have for this week.
