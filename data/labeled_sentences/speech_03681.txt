BULL0|"""David Einhorn's Green Light Capital announcing new positions in its second quarter, investor LED letter Leslie Pickers here, following the money on that story, Leslie what you find, hey, Melissa, so you're right, David Einhorn's Green Light Capital, adding new positions in Chemor's as well as Dillard and Scientific Games Corporation."
NEUT1|This is, according to Einhorn, second quarter letter, obtained by CNBC.
BEAR2|The firm also took a macro position against US corporate credit, both high yield and investment grade.
BEAR3|Einhorn says that there are quote signs the economy may be slowing and believes that rating agencies have been quote complacent.
NEUT4|Einhorn began his letter with a short case study of Chewy relative to pets.com, saying, for those that think the 2000 bubble was the Big Kahuna, consider Chewy, which went public.
NEUT5|In June 2019.
NEUT6|He did stop short, though of saying whether he was betting against Chewy, and noted that she was market value is more than 30 times pets comms at the peak, and he implied he believes that multiple is quite high.
BULL7|He reiterated his bullish case for Bright House Financial in bearish one for Assured Guaranty the firm sold out of BT Group and covered a short enough.
BEAR8|Company called Maui and Norwegian Salmon Farmer at a loss among the biggest winners though Einhorn's Tesla Short and Long's in gold and GM.
BULL9|Overall, the Fund returned 5.8% in the quarter and is up 17.4% in the year through June.
NEUT10|Melissa, a couple of positions caught my eye chambers, is an interesting one, certainly been being down, and it's caught up in this this weather.
NEUT11|It's exposed to these forever chemicals.
NEUT12|In the lawsuit, there was a spinoff from DuPont and so the question is, how much did DuPont actually know when they're spinning off?
NEUT13|Tumores about the liability there.
BEAR14|There are a lot of claims against this company we heard at the Sohn conference back in May.
NEUT15|Larry Robbins actually took the opposite side of this trade and was betting against Chemours for that reason and Einhorn in his letter says he believes liabilities associated with some of the class action lawsuits of those chemicals will be in the millions as opposed to the billions, which is what the Bears have been really betting against.
NEUT16|Or would you see Nana Tumores or this whole idea because she mores is really it's in this sort of class of stocks.
NEUT17|Where they had this huge headline risk, you don't really know how to handicap and necessarily need certainly got people who are betting against and people were begging for.
NEUT18|Yeah, I can't keep a lid.
NEUT19|Would look at Arconic.
NEUT20|You know in in the UK where everybody's been against it.
NEUT21|But here's what will happen even if it's in the billions.
NEUT22|The amounts in the billions stock will trade down to do an offering that's off to the races, so you know those things just don't matter that much.
NEUT23|Their events they take years to settle in term in terms of his bet against institutional corporate credit.
NEUT24|He's made a fortune on the complacency of the rating agencies.
NEUT25|So it's going out again, so I don't even know if he needs complacency to get there.
NEUT26|But because you're at historical low, so to me it's just a waiting game.
NEUT27|When they go, he could be waiting a long time, however, because default rates, right?
NEUT28|Just they're not there yet.
NEUT29|Yeah, you know, then picked up we waited a long time for Tesla.
BULL30|That seems to be finally paying off.
NEUT31|That's true.
NEUT32|We should note this is a second order as of the second quarter.
NEUT33|All these things happen in second quarter Dillard's last week.
NEUT34|We were just noting on fast money.
NEUT35|This is really unusual activity and if you pull up the chart 10 days or so you can see.
BEAR36|Just last week or two weeks ago we had a huge spike on very heavy volume in Dillard.
NEUT37|So you gotta wonder, I don't know.
NEUT38|Just it's it's odd.
NEUT39|"It's worth checking out."""
