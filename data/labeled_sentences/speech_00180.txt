NEUT0|"""Well, let's talk to Denise because partake is remarkable."
NEUT1|Here's a person who needed and couldn't find the good food for her job and decide, you know what I'm gonna do it and then became one of the great entrepreneurs raising a lot of money.
NEUT2|Your stories fantastic.
NEUT3|Please tell us how you did it in hell, Shopify's help.
NEUT4|Sure thing so I started partake in August of 2017 for the reason you said my Now 6 year old daughter.
NEUT5|I couldn't find snacks for her that I felt good about from a nutritional perspective that she felt good about from a taste perspective.
NEUT6|And so I left my nearly decade long career at Coca Cola to launch partaken.
NEUT7|We started with three flavors of cookies as a self funded business and we started working with Shopify from Day one.
BULL8|'cause it was important to us that we start generating profit very quickly and that we were able to get consumer feedback and a platform like Shopify.
BULL9|Allowed us to start for less than $50 a month and reach customers all across the country and have a direct and professional and safe relationship with them.
NEUT10|And so Shopify has been a huge part of our story from the very beginning.
NEUT11|I read an interview with you and it was amazing 'cause what you talked about is what I've always felt entrepreneur sponsors can't get.
NEUT12|You got data.
NEUT13|You got analytics from Shopify that shows you how people were purchasing who the consumer really was, and that's how you were able to get to the next level.
NEUT14|I'm always thinking that can speak.
BEAR15|Enterpreneur fails because the big guy has that data.
NEUT16|And the little person does it, but Shopify gave it to you.
NEUT17|Yeah, we knew who was I buying our product, where they were and so then when we started to think about brick and mortar retail, we could go into those regions.
NEUT18|We knew.
NEUT19|Why can what search words people were looking to find us and so that helped us in our digital marketing strategy.
NEUT20|And as we thought about what events to participate in and so it was a very low cost way to get the information that I was used to from my big CPG experience.
