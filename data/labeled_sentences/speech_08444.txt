NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well another day, higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT5|So Apple definitely needs to be updated here and the first time it was just a bit of an adjustment and the direction or the question becomes what direction is this.
NEUT6|Adjustment needs to be made and now that we have more data I'm going to adjust this area of resistance up here to you know what became very apparent as where the sellers were at today.
NEUT7|At 127 Mark I mean not to insult your intelligence but you saw what direction I adjusted that adjusting it in the upwards direction, which is always a good thing.
NEUT8|Assuming you're along, that's what you want to see.
NEUT9|You want to see levels of resistance need to be adjusted higher because that implies that higher highs are being put into play.
NEUT10|That's exactly what happened here, so moving forward.
NEUT11|Like I said, newest level of resistance now going to be right up there at the 127 mark and they were just when I'm going to make is a justice area of support.
NEUT12|Up to now what I would call the newest ideal level of support.
BULL13|Ideal support meaning for us clean would make this chart look the absolute best going forward and ideally speaking if the price comes up above 125 fifty that would be a very impressive sign of power.
NEUT14|But don't get me wrong, it's like if the price falls below that area that you know that implies entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL15|But yeah, I mean if the price could actually stay above 125 fifty that would be fantastic sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT16|And then as far as things are concerned, from the general point of view, that's where the purple line continues to play.
NEUT17|A role that being the 50.
NEUT18|Moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT19|So as time goes by, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful, because when it comes, just gauging the health of the overall move.
NEUT20|That right there have been defined as the move.
NEUT21|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT22|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT23|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|Her must visualize that.
NEUT25|That is what is being represented.
NEUT26|So keep running those couple areas moving forward.
BULL27|But from the grand scope of things that upwards trend continues higher highs, higher lows.
NEUT28|That is what matters most.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR35|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
