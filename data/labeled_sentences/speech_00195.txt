BULL0|"""Now you put out a really terrific study subscription impact report, COVID-19 Edition, which said gave a startling SIS statistic."
BULL1|Four out of five subscription companies are still growing despite the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
BULL2|I cannot say that for the advertising oriented companies, this is the best stickiest stream of revenue there is in this country.
NEUT3|That's right, I mean, we've been talking about the that the end of the ownership is coming, and what we're seeing right now.
NEUT4|It is here.
BULL5|You're absolutely four out of five companies are still growing their subscriber base despite the economic uncertainty.
NEUT6|If you look at your own mad COVID-19 index, some of those customers companies are actually our customers, Zune EA, Octa, Doc, you sign.
NEUT7|And so I think companies are.
NEUT8|People are starting to really wake up to the power of.
NEUT9|Recurring revenue and I like to think about it this way.
NEUT10|Let's say you're playing football in your subscription business.
NEUT11|All the other companies have to start way back there on their 20 yard line with the entire field in front of them.
BEAR12|But you get to start 10 yards away from a touchdown and that's why you're seeing to the statistics clothing retail down 80%.
BEAR13|But Stitch Fix is doing well, right auto sales down 80% with Zipcar memberships, actually taking up and you had mentioned advertising sales down but.
BEAR14|Media subscriptions, including that places like the street, are on fire.
BULL15|This is a much, much Better Business model.
NEUT16|Is this true?
NEUT17|I don't want to brag about it, but you know, we're not quite.
NEUT18|It is true.
NEUT19|Now, let me ask you something.
NEUT20|There's a great crystal clear like the football analogy that will really get people to understand the Fender Play example.
NEUT21|Fender Fender is an amazing story and the Fender Fender is not.
NEUT22|It could just just a guitar company anymore.
NEUT23|Fender is actually now a media company.
NEUT24|They've got the service Fender play that teaches you basically how there's 3000 videos.
NEUT25|You can watch that teach you how to play the guitar and they have 10X their subscriber base.
NEUT26|We're all trapped at home pulling out our guitar from underneath our beds and so you think about it, there's a million new guitar players that are not sitting on the couch watching Tiger King.
NEUT27|Instead, they're playing the guitar.
NEUT28|They're learning how to play the guitar.
NEUT29|If this is not the whole new world, and I don't know what is.
