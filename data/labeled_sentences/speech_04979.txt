NEUT0|"""What I want to show it I was talking about that that analysis on the NASDAQ."
NEUT1|From an intraday perspective right?
NEUT2|Anna Steven about how the intraday analysis in these retracements can give you a little bit of a different read, and so when you're looking at the net when you're looking at a standard bearish retracement K on an intraday timeframe on a daily time, whatever it is, your standard bearish retracement will look something along the lines of this, you know?
NEUT3|You look sharp, but you have that nice angle still going up and then it slows its momentum a little bit and then you get this triggering action underneath that support level, right?
NEUT4|So you get this standard Type 45, nineteen, 45 degree angle up.
NEUT5|It then triggers was slowing momentum and you get that nice little read.
NEUT6|That's not what we were seeing on the NASDAQ.
NEUT7|What you are seeing is this type of price action.
NEUT8|And when you see this type of price action.
NEUT9|And then you see that.
NEUT10|What is your read?
NEUT11|Right?
NEUT12|Here.
NEUT13|Emily.
NEUT14|What's your read right there?
NEUT15|Well, that is a test of that old resistance level, so.
NEUT16|It doesn't.
NEUT17|It doesn't break it, so that's that's your knew support level, so you forget about all that choppiness that was down there before that becomes your new support level, right?
NEUT18|But when you're just at four when you're just doing the 45 degree angle up, you don't have that.
NEUT19|You don't have that.
NEUT20|You don't have the time frame to create that support level, and so when you're looking again at the NASDAQ and coming down to that hourly chart, you see that wide range W pattern.
BEAR21|Obviously, it's very very volatile and daily chart.
NEUT22|You see that volatility there you see that wide range.
NEUT23|Here, breakout retest is not surprising.
BEAR24|The NASDAQ confirms and rocks.
NEUT25|That's not surprising.
NEUT26|That's exactly what should transpire.
NEUT27|"And that's why I called for the K trade analysis yesterday."""
