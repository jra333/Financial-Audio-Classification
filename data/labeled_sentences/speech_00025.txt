NEUT1|In today's NIO, stock analysis and predictions why NIO stock is up December 30th?
NEUT2|Let's get started.
BEAR3|The electric vehicle manufacturer now, who has been growing at lightning speed this past year, has recently been having some issues and stagnating for the past month.
NEUT4|However, this week the things have changed.
BULL5|NIO stock is now up for a good percentage number 2 days in a row.
NEUT6|But why is this Solon?
NEUT7|Should you sell?
BULL8|Most analysts agree that Neil is very good for the long term, and this growth is sustainable.
BEAR9|NIO has been down this past month even though there was nothing but good news about it.
NEUT10|First, there were falsely listing rumors.
NEUT11|Then they raised capital and on Monday it was due to the investigation.
BEAR12|This left many investors worried about the future of the company.
BULL13|However, now is back to its normal growth for the past two days.
BEAR14|The reason no price is now increasing is due to all good news that outweighed the bad ones and as well as if we think about why NIO has been down in the past month, we realized that it was not due to Niles fundamentals, but due to bad news from other companies.
BULL15|Analysts still expect Neo to be a long term winner and there is no day approaching, which will be a huge catalyst for the stock price.
NEUT16|If we look at historic nowadays.
BULL17|In 2018, the stock share price almost tripled in 2019.
BULL18|The stock went from around $12.00 to $18.00, which is amazing growth.
NEUT19|Most analysts expect Nyota do the same this Nile day.
BULL20|Neo will be releasing its brand new sedan E7, which will be a direct competitor to Tesla Model 3 battery as a service and a new 150 kilowatts per hour battery as well as possible expansion plans to Europe.
NEUT21|Now you might be interested in where this will lead Neo stock and the median prediction.
NEUT22|I found many Wall Street analysts price targets for Neo Day and after combining them and dividing them by the number of analysts, I gotta median price of $63 after Neo Day.
BULL23|This would be very good growth for Neo stock, but analysts on the Wall Street would not be surprised.
BULL24|In summary, Nile is a great long term opportunity that after a month of bad news and stagnation has started going back up, CNN analysts predict the median Nile stock price to be $327.00 within the next 12 months, which is amazing and this could turn its investors very wealthy within the next five years.
NEUT25|As more and more governments passed legislation.
NEUT26|Banning gas powered vehicles.
NEUT27|Basically neo.
BULL28|Will it be a long term winner hold long and strong blue skies are coming.
