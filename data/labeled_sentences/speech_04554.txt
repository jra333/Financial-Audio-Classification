NEUT0|"""See this, a single sentence, 1 penny."
BULL1|It's the reason why U.S. bank stocks are rising today.
BULL2|On the opening day of the second quarter earnings season, JP Morgan just behind me, delivered earnings per share for the quarter of $1.55.
BULL3|That's up 1 cent from $1.54 in the same.
NEUT4|A year earlier.
NEUT5|A single sense of earnings growth is not much to write home about, but in the context of very low interest rates and very turbulent market with Brexit and with the threat of a slower growth in China in the US, the two big engines of the world economy.
NEUT6|It's not too bad at all.
BEAR7|Consensus forecast from analysts were for $1.42, so JP Morgan's well ahead of that, even though it's sort of cheated to get there, it raided its reserves for litigation losses to take a $430 million benefits.
BULL8|What pleased, most analysts, is that the core of the bank is in pretty good shape.
BULL9|Bond trading revenues in particular were up strongly.
BEAR10|Equities were pretty flat on M&A.
BULL11|Was down a fair bit, but overall it was a decent picture and in the retail bank you've got strong growth in mortgages, so you've got decent performance in credit cards and car loans.
BULL12|So overall the picture is fairly good.
BULL13|So the bars been set quite high for the rest of the big banks as they follow with their second quarter reports in coming days.
NEUT14|Citigroup Wells Fargo Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs.
NEUT15|They all have to do as well as JP Morgan if they want their shares to respond in the same way.
BEAR16|That's going to be tricky.
NEUT17|Of course, while interest rates are so low, and while the prospect of rises this year is so dim.
NEUT18|That's why for now the big banks will be grateful for all these pennies.

NEUT20|New York.
BEAR21|Something strange is happening in Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the euro zone.
BEAR22|"Official interest rates have gone below 0."""
