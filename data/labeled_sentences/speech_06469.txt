NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BULL1|Today will be looking at GBP JPY on the daily chart, so zooming in we can see that GBP JPY is sustaining its upward trajectory, reaching a 35 1/2 month high of 153.20 and bearish powers seem to be incapable of overthrowing the uptrend.
BULL2|The soaring, simple moving averages are safeguarding the positive structure, while the rising each more lines are indicating a rekindling positive momentum.
BULL3|The short term oscillators are reflecting the poles in the pairs climb, but are favoring the improving picture.
BEAR4|If by an interest persists, initial constraints could arise from the nearby resistance band of 153.62 to 154.04 from back in February, April 2018.
BULL5|However, surpassing this barrier may bolster upwards efforts pushing the pit towards a 155.44 obstacle, which happens to be the 150% Fibonacci retracement of the download from 144.94 to 124.
BEAR6|Another leg higher could then challenge the resistance section of 100 and 56256.60 molded between end of January and early February 2018.
BEAR7|If sellers resurface and steer the price down, preliminary support could come from the 152 handle.
BEAR8|Pilot in lower the Pearmain countered downside friction from each marker lines around 150.96 before the price hits the supportive trendline drawn from the 136.95 truck.
BEAR9|Should the pricing further below this mark sellers may then target the cloud and 50 days may at 148.51.
BEAR10|In the event this truck fails to offer some footing for buyers, the support zone of 147.59 to 148.10 underneath may attempt to annul the price decline.
BEAR11|Summarizing, GBP JPY sellers seem unable to dethrone the upward pattern, and the more than three month ascent remains intact above the trend line, and the 148.51 Trump.
NEUT12|That's it for me.
BULL13|"Have a great trading day."""
