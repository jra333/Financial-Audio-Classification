BEAR0|"""Well, another disappointing day for AMC."
BEAR1|Are we dead in the water?
NEUT2|Is it all?
NEUT3|But over?
NEUT4|I really don't think so, and I'm going to explain why.
BEAR5|So we open today at 948 instantly when the market opened we started dipping down 808.
BEAR6|We dip all the way down to $6.33 back up to 8 dollars 8:30 and we stayed around $7.00 all the way to close at 782.
BEAR7|I think a lot of people are nervous right now.
NEUT8|A lot of people are scared, but I don't think you should be because the short.
NEUT9|Others still need to cover their shorts.
NEUT10|Also, all the people switching brokerages, all the people leaving Robin Hood going to Weibo corner, everything else to buy up stocks.
NEUT11|They're still waiting to get the confirmation to get the money in their accounts.
NEUT12|And now that AMC is down, more people are going to by forcing the source sellers to sell those shorts, and hopefully we'll see that squeeze that sends it back to 15 back to 20 and beyond.
NEUT13|Well, it happened tomorrow.
NEUT14|No.
NEUT15|I honestly don't think so.
NEUT16|We're probably going to kind of stay around 7-8 dollars.
BEAR17|Might drop to six.
NEUT18|I'm hoping it won't.
BULL19|However, Friday might be good.
NEUT20|We might get over $10, but I think next week is when we're really going to see that climb where we're going to see the short shows, so selling their shorts more buying action.
BULL21|There was decent volume.
NEUT22|Don't give up hope.
NEUT23|Hold the line.
NEUT24|I have 70 shares of AMC at around $9 a share, not selling.
NEUT25|I'm holding.
NEUT26|So this is more just motivation.
NEUT27|Hold, hold, hold tomorrow.
NEUT28|I don't think it's going to be anything crazy.
NEUT29|7-8 dollars hold the line.
NEUT30|Don't give up.
NEUT31|This is not financial advice.
NEUT32|We gotta stick it to the big guys on Wall Street.
NEUT33|You know what do your thing?
NEUT34|This is not financial advice so hold the line.
NEUT35|Alright, let's go AMC to the moon.
NEUT36|Gotta subscribe hit that like button if you knew my name is Jack, this is investing with jacks.
