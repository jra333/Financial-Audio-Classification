BULL0|"""Thank you."
BEAR1|Well, we were nosed out by a landslide.
NEUT2|But I have no regrets.
NEUT3|And you shouldn't either.
NEUT4|For together, you and I have transformed the public agenda, the political landscape.
BULL5|Together we have created a new conservative agenda.
NEUT6|And that agenda will come to pass.
NEUT7|Mark my words.
BULL8|Now we have an opportunity again to help create an environment here at home and around the world where our values can see.
NEUT9|We must remind ourselves.
NEUT10|That life is a God endowed right, not a state endowed right that when the least of us are vulnerable, ultimately all of us are vulnerable.
NEUT11|And that is why we must engage in a national dialogue with those who don't yet agree with our goal and try to persuade them each step of the way that life indeed does begin at conception and should end only at natural death.
NEUT12|"Well I think is."""
