NEUT0|"""As far as China goes Jim, there is of course this report out of Reuters that Commerce is tightening once again some restrictions on wowway Wilbur Ross saying they're looking at Tick Tock, no formal steps on Baba, but that meeting Jim to take stock of where we are on phase one getting delayed looks a little more interesting."
NEUT1|In light of these wow wait this way news this is such a Cold War.
NEUT2|Remember Qualcomm last week was trying to do more business with Broadway on the nonstrategic which is the 5G.
NEUT3|If the White House to deems 5G is strategic then look out.
BEAR4|That's going to be a wholesale pull back because there's not just wow.
BULL5|Wow, you guys who wants our 5G technology, we're still ahead in some of 5G technology.
NEUT6|I find that the President and Peter Navarro and Peter was very honest that he doesn't really know what the president think it to get money.
NEUT7|But Peter comes on TV and basically Cold Warrior rises.
NEUT8|The situation, 'cause that's what he's been.
NEUT9|I question whether he's Hawk enough.
NEUT10|So I mean sometimes they feel he soft on technology.
NEUT11|He doesn't like it when I say this often.
BEAR12|Technology soft on technology because he's not wearing enough with Webgl stealing our technology.
NEUT13|He used to be very strong intellectual property stealing, but it seem worried about Taiwan semi like I am Taiwan.
NEUT14|Semi is absolutely the most important company company when it comes to our semiconductors and we are at their mercy if we don't protect them.
NEUT15|And I urge people to look into the situation.
NEUT16|I don't Peter flattering, so I was a child.
BEAR17|We were back in the throes of sort of existential crisis in March and April.
NEUT18|Your general take was let's hold off on ramping up escalation Visa vie China.
NEUT19|But it sounds like maybe you think we now have cushion to do just that.
BULL20|I do think that we have a bit of a head of steam coming into this economy now.
NEUT21|Obviously, I still hope that we get some sort of agreement between the Democrats and Republicans, but let's just take the average is right?
NEUT22|What are the strong stocks in the averages?
NEUT23|It's technology and technology is.
NEUT24|That's where we need to worry.
NEUT25|And I really.
BEAR26|Do not like it when washing tries to crack down on Google and Facebook 'cause they've been shut out of China from day one.
NEUT27|I do worry about Apple at all times.
BULL28|I think the Chinese, if they made a commitment Apple, then I think we would back off.
NEUT29|That would be.
NEUT30|They need to make a sign, a sign that says we want this to end.
NEUT31|We want to make peace.
NEUT32|We're going to buy Apple stuff and then I think the president might just say you know what?
NEUT33|OK, let let but they haven't made any sign that they've made no sign whatsoever that they want peace not.
NEUT34|They are, though they want.
NEUT35|They'll step right up, but Taiwan Semi is what we have to worry bout not those stocks.
NEUT36|Those are ***.
NEUT37|Netflix can't even sell a movement when Netflix is going to go big in China.
NEUT38|They won't even let him there.

NEUT42|"The pictures have staying there is that we don't want to show what is that?"""
