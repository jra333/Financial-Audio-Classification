NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see from this day charge Apple stock has rised from the beginning of the market and then rise till."
NEUT1|Meat of the day and go study a little bit down here and nearly the close of the market.
NEUT2|It goes study, so there's no more job.
BEAR3|So it's a very bullish sentiment for Apple.
NEUT4|Compared to the past weeks, because if we changed the chart into the daily chart we can see.
NEUT5|Here.
NEUT6|Aft.
NEUT7|Our continued job he has.
NEUT8|Break out from the downtown why?
NEUT9|Because if we draw a line here, we can see here clearly.
NEUT10|Here.
NEUT11|Here is the dungeon.
BEAR12|We see here this is a dungeon, so now clearly Apple had break heart from this downtrend with very small volume this means.
NEUT13|The struggle of Apple has finished in short term, so in my opinion.
NEUT14|Apple stock.
BULL15|Has managed to.
NEUT16|Keep his prize above the EMS, especially above the 50 days year May is a very important sign any stock can keep about 50 days.
NEUT17|Year may means there's a further.
NEUT18|Advance for it.
BEAR19|So in my opinion, now the Apple stock has found it short and bottom is here and this one is higher than the 103 that made during the 21st of September.
BULL20|So it's a very positive sign for Apple stock and for now we can see.
BULL21|Apple will make a high from here and very possible for the Apple to lead the whole market again.
