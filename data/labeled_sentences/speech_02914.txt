NEUT0|"""Hey guys, it's Vivian."
NEUT1|Your hot stock girl today I'm going to discuss Facebook.
NEUT2|The ticker symbol is FB.
NEUT3|Facebook is one of the largest social media companies in the world and as everyone knows it operates Facebook and Instagram.
BEAR4|Facebook's stock dropped around 20% after reported second quarter earnings back in July, even though revenues were up, 42% makes no sense right?
NEUT5|We need to look a little closer to see why so many investors bailed.
BEAR6|At the stock knew user growth has slowed and maybe close to reaching its saturation point.
BEAR7|What I think spook investors to most is that Facebook ad interaction dropped by 20%.
BEAR8|This is alarming because if less people interact with an ad then they will have to drop their advertising rates.
NEUT9|They're charging their customers.
BEAR10|If advertisers can't reach as many customers with Facebook as they used to, then they may spend their advertising dollars elsewhere.
NEUT11|What I did like on the last.
BULL12|Earnings report was that Facebook average revenue per user grew from $23.00 to $25.
NEUT13|This is important.
NEUT14|Facebook knows so much information about its users that marketers can't directly target interested consumers.
BEAR15|I think these stock is oversold.
BULL16|Ann is a strong buy here, treating at only 16 times EBIT ah.
BEAR17|There may be some volatility for the next few quarters because of the GDP.
NEUT18|Are privacy rules in Europe, but this will just give investors time to accumulate shares.
NEUT19|At a decent value five years from now, investors will look back at this time period as the last Golden opportunity to buy Facebook shares at a good price.
NEUT20|My advice is to buy some shares now and accumulate shares until you own your full position.
NEUT21|So there you have it.
