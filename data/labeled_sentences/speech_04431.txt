BEAR0|"""There's some genuine carnage away from tech that no one's been talking about because it's been done rolling and ripping PepsiCo."
NEUT1|That's a good example.
BULL2|It's an excellent company.
BEAR3|It's got great growth for packaged food play, and it's tremendous balance sheet, yet it's pulled back 11% from its highs to the point where the stock now yields more than 3%.
NEUT4|Hey guys, this is snacking company.
NEUT5|Don't we snapped more homers than what people say.
BULL6|General Mills just reported a great quarter and raise its dividend to 3.5% level.
BEAR7|It's come down from 66 to 57 people.
BEAR8|Don't like the quarter?
NEUT9|Already kidding me was fine.
NEUT10|They raise it dividend, they weren't supposed to do that for another couple of quarters.
NEUT11|We recently had James Quincy, the CEO of Coca Cola on the show, and he calls a very compelling story in stock yields.
BEAR12|3.4% have a change, a another quality defensive name also keeps getting blasted or bounce a bit.
NEUT13|Today on news that it's starting gigantic vaccine trial against covid, these stocks represent real value.
NEUT14|I think you can buy some of them tomorrow and then buy more if they go lower.
NEUT15|Those you do in stage down.
NEUT16|Plus they have the added than just not having any hot money.
NEUT17|And then what so ever.
NEUT18|So your fellow shareholders aren't going to panic and dump the stocks as they go lower now.
NEUT19|One more key difference versus 1999 is that we've had weeks.
NEUT20|Where in some sectors rollover aggressively like the recent weed, isn't code PepsiCo, General Mills and I'm like.
NEUT21|Back then though bonds are giving you next to no yield and the Fed Chairman just told us that we can expect that to continue, possibly for years if you want income.
NEUT22|Well here you go.
NEUT23|OK, these are like bonds that also have the ability to grow.
NEUT24|I like to think of it as two great tastes that taste great together.
NEUT25|Abed look I'm not trying to log into a false sense of security, or I'd be wrong.
BEAR26|The markets getting pulverized.
BEAR27|I think there could be more downside here.
BEAR28|We're headed for chopping times as many of the permanently bullish new investors get washed out as they discover that stocks don't always go up on last nights off the charts, the legendary Larry Williams told us to expect turbulence until mid to late October.
NEUT29|He's been emphatic that the end of September where we are now will be no picking for the Bulls.
NEUT30|I recommend leg into the stocks.
BEAR31|I just mentioned weakness because they work even if covid cases keeps spiking and the economy slows down.
NEUT32|Both of which I think is going to happen.
BEAR33|The bottom line, I expect this market stay volatile, with the downside bias until more of those overly bullish new investors throw in any towel that they may be holding.
NEUT34|We can't know when they'll be done there selling.
NEUT35|That's impossible, but we do know when it makes sense to start buying into weakness.
BEAR36|The high Flyers work down 25% from the top, and the defenses work when they yield North of three.
NEUT37|But when it comes to anything else, you have to be patient, because better prices could lurk into the murk.
