NEUT0|"""I want let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|If we check the daily chart we can see here Apple has formed a red candle.
NEUT2|It means a job for the day.
NEUT3|If we check it in detail, we can see for this red candle.
NEUT4|The low point is a 118.81 and if we compare it with yesterday the green kind of before it, the law will be 118.15.
NEUT5|That means the law here.
BEAR6|Is higher than the law here, so there's no no no NYU law here, so it means there's no new law as we check the volume here we can see the volume is very small compared to citing days several days ago.
NEUT7|So in my opinion.
BEAR8|Even though today the share has been dropped, a lot is 1.4% but required regarding the volume is not so large, so I think this is not a pessimistic side, it's it's obvious it's a.
BULL9|It's a bullish sign for Apple.
BULL10|So in mid term I think the Apple stock will still go higher from here.
NEUT11|We can see here the price is still above several years and also the momentum keep their study.
BULL12|We can see here the momentum is not too bad.
BULL13|So regarding the volume is not so large so it's still possible for Apple stock to go higher from here.
NEUT14|This is 1 full back.
NEUT15|This is the second pull back, so after these two pullbacks and with no new laws.
BULL16|So I think the stock will go higher from here.
NEUT17|So will the whole US share market will go here.
BULL18|"Thank you so much."""
