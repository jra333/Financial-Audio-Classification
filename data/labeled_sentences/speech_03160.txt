NEUT0|"""I looks like the feds trying to thread the needle."
NEUT1|I mean, they're trying to have it both ways, which you know look, they just want to give themselves as much latitude as possible, right?
NEUT2|They're buying time it goes back exactly to what we talked about.
NEUT3|Is this balance of risks as John mentioned is they don't really know how to assess those risks.
NEUT4|The reality is you have a lot of factors that they have to re-evaluate.
BULL5|For example, dollar strengthened this year, oil plummeted this year.
BEAR6|Credit spreads blew out, the markets are down and all of that even though is right now not translating into the employment numbers.
NEUT7|If it's will start to translate into employment numbers via the confidence channel, we won't know this now.
NEUT8|We might know this by March, so the service employment will be key to watch.
NEUT9|Let's take a look at the Dow right now.
NEUT10|Tell you what the markets think of this statement before we let Mr. Russo, Mr. Russell Air down 18 point.
NEUT11|So I mean not not a huge move.
NEUT12|You're probably going to see a lot of bouncing back and forth now before they take a choice, a decision they may not even figure out what they want to do.
NEUT13|It.
NEUT14|I'm closing Bell hits, but Steve, I want to ask you, we started to talk about this before it came in.
BEAR15|The Fed versus the markets venant back off of March as John said.
BEAR16|But they did seem to ease off a little bit on their tone.
NEUT17|Is this going to be enough to satisfy the markets so the markets want more and more markets?
NEUT18|Really trying to push the Fed into doing something well?
NEUT19|What's really interesting about all this is that there's been a lot of talk about the Fed's credibility and how the Fed is kind of moving the goal posts pretty in a pretty regular pace here, but also what's just as important, if not more important is the fragility of the markets right now.
NEUT20|And so the fact that you get magic way to put in fact that you get a 25 basis point rate hike last night.
NEUT21|And the markets go crazy even though that was probably the most well telegraphed rate hike of all time.
NEUT22|It just shows that the really the tough spot here that markets are in right now, and so getting back to Anastasia's point with you, when you have such the dollar strengthening at the pace that it is right now, it's filtering over into the economic data you're seeing.
BEAR23|Manufacturing has been really struggling recently, and if that continues, that's going to be another warning sign for the analysis.
NEUT24|Want to get your take on this?
NEUT25|'cause you know you look, you're on the street?
NEUT26|You talk.
NEUT27|I'm sure you talk to.
NEUT28|People around the water cooler.
BEAR29|A big question that we're seeing here on our end of it is that people are saying December was a mistake.
NEUT30|It was too soon.
NEUT31|They shouldn't have raised or some variation on that.
NEUT32|What do you think of that and what are you hearing on that?
NEUT33|Clearly we're hearing several different opinions.
NEUT34|My opinion is that it was not a mistake based on the fact that they have stipulated that they're going to act on what they've said is that they needed the predominant of evidence.
BULL35|The preponderance of evidence to act, meaning there's been cumulative improvement in the unemployment rate.
BULL36|And there's been a lot of improvement in the unemployment rate at 5%.
NEUT37|I think they had to make that first step, but as I've always said, an as I will say today again, is until there's more economic momentum.
NEUT38|There's not going to be a whole lot of rates momentum.
NEUT39|So for example, if you look at vehicle sales, if you look at retail sales, all of those things are picking up in absolute numbers.
BEAR40|But if I calculate year over year change, it's actually been declining.
NEUT41|So where's that momentum?
NEUT42|Until we see that we're not going to see rates momentum?
NEUT43|Alright Anastasia Amoroso, JP Morgan funds Steve Rousselot ahead of the tape columnist.
BULL44|"I want to thank you both."""
