NEUT0|"""Let's talk about the doubt."
BEAR1|Now we're seeing this seemingly modest losses across the board.
NEUT2|That's right, not a lot of economic data infected man today.
NEUT3|Here in the US we had some deal active.
BEAR4|Down down, there's the big board down about 3.6 points.
NEUT5|I mean, basically unmoved as zero point.
BEAR6|3% but the other thing we have to keep in mind this Friday we all of the major taxes down less than a point, right?
NEUT7|The NASDAQ, the S&P and I think there's pretty pretty.
BEAR8|On on moved down one point, nothing.
NEUT9|Sorry you were saying all of those indexes basically stopped just short of where they were earlier this year in early May and a lot of people who look at the charts basically say that when you get to those levels approaching where you were at your high few months ago, there's going to be resistance there, which means this is a technical thing.
NEUT10|Saying that as not bumpy, not all prices are created equal.
NEUT11|Now what's interesting to me about the NASDAQ and the Dow Jones and the S&P is they both contain Apple.
BULL12|Apple obviously surge today.
BEAR13|That must mean that everything else did really quite badly.
NEUT14|That's not entirely true, of course.
NEUT15|I mentioned we had some deal.
BULL16|We had some deal action to, and we saw it now and Coventry too.
BULL17|Big healthcare providers basically benefit from news of a takeover, so that was also helping things out.
NEUT18|But you're right.
NEUT19|I mean, we are in a quiet time of the year.
BEAR20|Volumes were down and as I say we have this resistance which is almost like a little ceiling there that the market has to push through.
NEUT21|But I think if you're bullish what you argue here is that if we're able to get through that roof.
NEUT22|The Sky is the limit.
NEUT23|You know.
NEUT24|That's sort of what people are saying.
NEUT25|Big if though now this week we're expecting some minutes from the Federal reserves Open Market Committee meeting the last meeting.
NEUT26|There's any ideas what will people be looking for in that and when do we get that news?
BULL27|Well, there's only one thing people are looking for, and that's evidenced that Ben Bernanke is moving closer towards easing.
NEUT28|And of course, that means more printing money.
NEUT29|Let's put that in English.
NEUT30|That's right, more printing money that's right and the minutes are important.
NEUT31|They definitely are.
NEUT32|They show us they give us a window into the thinking that's going on at the Fed.
NEUT33|But what people are really caring about here now is August 31st, September 1st.
NEUT34|That's when he gets in front of a microphone again and speaks to the public.
NEUT35|"About whether or not he's ready to go ahead with another round and that one will be very real time minutes here a little backward looking."""
