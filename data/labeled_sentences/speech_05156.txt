BEAR9|Lower than American Company oppose a Japanese company opposing.
NEUT10|I think I knew that Japan would have like their own streaming service.
BEAR11|An Roku fell on Tuesday after Apple announced its streaming service will cost 5 bucks.
BULL12|I would agree with you expected and that undercuts rivals prices.
NEUT13|And also if you have a Mac, iPhone, Apple TV.
NEUT14|Who is your free year of the service?
NEUT15|Disney.
NEUT16|Disney got old yard.
NEUT17|Did this, of course there's you get dizzy fanboys here, but now that comes and said, take a quarter in the bonus worth and platform Disney, AT&T and Comcast.
NEUT18|Whether the Market Insider Home page for more stories there will be a place for video.
BEAR19|But as he went down 2%, Netflix announced 3%.
BEAR20|Roku went down 12% ours because Roku is not much popular as Netflix.
NEUT21|And of course there is.
NEUT22|HBO also has cancelled on.
NEUT23|Does the car several more.
NEUT24|Amazon Cost 9 month, who caught six a month for the basic Plan or Netflix and HBO offer those services over 10 and our local costs.

NEUT35|But you know this is Disney is went up we end anything that comes to challenge Disney is.
NEUT36|It's always good, you know.
NEUT37|People will have, Netflix is gone and Izzy Davis takes over streaming.
NEUT38|That means Disney will have base given opoly like how Netflix used to have because that focuses the first one for an only one for a while.
NEUT39|The only choice for streaming for awhile.
NEUT40|Disney does basically would have a monopoly.
NEUT41|All of which we all know disease should not have been opoly over everything but.
NEUT42|An African HBO offer their services for 10 and this is basically at this D warstock because the competition is cheaper than Disney's.
