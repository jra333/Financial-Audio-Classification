BULL0|"""We do have at least one upgrade today as analysts play catch up, Cowen goes to market perform."
NEUT1|They say we fully admit we've been wrong the last few years in the shares tend to work.
NEUT2|They add when new things are coming and Musk did address the topic of profitability last night.
NEUT3|Here's what he said.
NEUT4|We need to.
NEUT5|Yeah, not go bankrupt.
NEUT6|Obviously that's important.
BEAR7|'cause that will fail in our mission.
NEUT8|But we're not trying to be super profitable.
NEUT9|Either obscure like you know, profitability is like.
NEUT10|1% or something?
BULL11|Yeah, this one or two percent.
NEUT12|It's not.
NEUT13|It's not crazy.
NEUT14|The score is only point 1%.
NEUT15|So.
NEUT16|We want to be profitable.
NEUT17|Like I think just wanna be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars that is affordable as possible.
NEUT18|That's like we're trying to achieve.
BULL19|Jim, it's remarkable.
NEUT20|Still for a company that has 1% of the global market market cap of Tesla is basically what three times the SMP auto sector.
NEUT21|Well, I think people if you listen to call you think it's a big technology company and so therefore it's right up there with some of the other technology companies that we follow.
BULL22|Did they execute better than Microsoft?
NEUT23|No, but the expectations for their execution had never been higher.
BULL24|Tesla and they vastly exceeded it.
NEUT25|I thought it was just a.
NEUT26|It was a lovable quarter was a teddy bear quarter and.
NEUT27|It was one of those quarters where his the test lights have to be proud.
NEUT28|It was just so strong and that's because there's demand everywhere.
NEUT29|I mean, even since we not talk about them.
NEUT30|And I mean yeah, yes, you talk about profitability, but when you have demand when the other guys are closing plants 'cause they don't demand what it says is you're not selling what they're selling, you're making something entirely different from what they're making.
NEUT31|And I know that we had Mr. Jackson on from AutoNation.
NEUT32|And yeah, they're selling a lot of pickup trucks, or one 50s.
NEUT33|Whatever this man is selling technology, and I think that he's talking about fully assisted.
NEUT34|And then he's talking about driverless.
NEUT35|I mean, he's just he's thinking so much bigger.
NEUT36|David, he's a big thinker.
NEUT37|"He makes us look like lilliputians"""
