NEUT0|"""Alright, welcome back to answer some of your questions."
NEUT1|Now Joe.
NEUT2|I come to you first from Nick in New Jersey.
NEUT3|Everybody good alright AbbVie?
NEUT4|I bought Abby at $69 about two months ago.
NEUT5|This distance thing is really difficult.
NEUT6|I don't want to sell, but would like to add more.
NEUT7|Is that a good idea?
BEAR8|Sure, 52 week high today I clearly missed it when it was down at 69.
NEUT9|It's a name that I had owned previously.
BEAR10|I was conflicted at the time because I owned in Big Pharma.
NEUT11|I had Abbott Labs and I had Eli Eli Lilly.
NEUT12|Rather, it's both 150 to 175 billion market cap size, but this stock is breaking out Courtney and John.
NEUT13|It's dear to their hearts.
NEUT14|Illinois based an it's a name that I should have gotten back in.
NEUT15|I missed it.
NEUT16|OK, next court from Jake and Wisconsin fundamentals is seemingly loose term.
NEUT17|I often hear on CNBC what are they exactly?
NEUT18|Good question.
NEUT19|What are fundamentals?
NEUT20|So that's actually the easiest way to think about it is that's what actually the stock is based around, right?
NEUT21|It's the actual growth of the stock.
NEUT22|It's the revenues.
NEUT23|It's the profitability.
NEUT24|Those are the fundamentals.
NEUT25|When you talk about quants there solely looking at the numbers alone.
NEUT26|When you're looking at fundamentals, it's the qualitative assessment of the company couple.
NEUT27|Generally with the quantitative assessment.
NEUT28|OK, John Adjarian coming to you now from Salmon Albany, NY.
NEUT29|Is Netflix a stay at home stock that will continue to perform as states reopen?
NEUT30|Sam, yes it is, and yes it will.
BEAR31|I think Sam today just minutes ago we had unusual activity at the 500 strike, which means somebody betting that the stock that's 470 some odd dollars a share goes through 500 in the short term.
NEUT32|By next Friday judge.
NEUT33|So yes, I would hold it and I'm looking for more upside there.
NEUT34|Kevin O'Leary from Gordon, Seattle.
NEUT35|Should I take profits in Tesla?
NEUT36|Good question?
NEUT37|Or is there more room to run?
BULL38|Tesla bigger market cap now than Toyota.
NEUT39|Yep, Tesla is a name that I have been in for almost a year now.
NEUT40|I bought it around last July when it was downgraded around 20-30.
NEUT41|My attitude about stocks like this, which clearly when you talk about fundamentals are stretched valuations.
NEUT42|But you know people that believe in a brand around electric cars and Tesla has proven that they can make them are sticking with the stock that I have sold.
BEAR43|Tesla as recently as yesterday because it keeps bumping up in the portfolio.
NEUT44|It's in a 5% weighting.
NEUT45|The stock is relentless in terms of its increase, so by selling it at 5% and I'm talking about a little investment philosophy here.
NEUT46|I'm taking plenty off the table while I still stay in the name.
NEUT47|I just generally never let a name get past 5% and Tesla has been doing that every week.
NEUT48|And so I've been selling and selling and selling and selling and one day when it corrects.
BEAR49|"Hopefully I will have, you know, taken enough off the table that I simply won't care."""
