BULL0|"""I am thanks for watching this quick video on Microsoft stock in front of us."
NEUT1|There is one hour candle stick showing this Microsoft price moment.
NEUT2|Actually it looks like more like that without my technical analysis, interpretation and even why my without my exponential moving average.
NEUT3|So this is the price moment and with a little bit of technical analysis, easy taking analysis, easy to like trendlines, we can find valuable to find that.
NEUT4|And then this week and see.
NEUT5|This is the amazing thing.
NEUT6|So those are all bottoms in those red lines are alternate lines and the blue line is the magic tree.
NEUT7|So using the exponential moving average, changing a little bit the length.
NEUT8|I think under this is not is too short.
NEUT9|Let's put 200 and edit this so that these amazing exponential moving average again worked perfectly as a trend line is bottoms for some of the support.
BEAR10|Sorry for some of the bottoms of these new.
NEUT11|Of these these rallies, perhaps this one, this one, this one.
BEAR12|This one was always there, this one and now this one no, it was broken, giving a weakness signal by Gina in this situation the prices seems that they started posing, moving sideways rather than following going up trend upwards.
BEAR13|So in fact, what we can see is the prices has been moving in a bullish market since April, so the market is bullish and ideas to fall over to invest the majority and so.
NEUT14|To invest in the market direction so to go along to buy what to do now?
NEUT15|The idea is to go long as per major trend, but this this level of 200 and 200 this work the support but to go along only if this residence level will be broken the next days.
BEAR16|If these 215 residents left will be broken at the ice to go long or.
NEUT17|Otherwise, if this one is going to be broken, there may be an option where the prices can really care, really jumped down, and this level of 2015 is gonna work as it's gonna work.
NEUT18|His resistance for those new price movements.
NEUT19|So only if this residence level or two one or five is gonna be broke.
NEUT20|The idea is to go long or otherwise.
NEUT21|If this level is normal and this is what can happen, the process can start moving.
NEUT22|Originally in an original way, before going upward.
NEUT23|In this situation, we can say say that the prices are posing before resuming their previous manager.
BEAR24|Talent is an uptrend, so it's a bullish trend.
NEUT25|So there are two options.
BULL26|One option is this one by believe that this resistance level will be broken the next day, so that is to go long up to this target price of minimum target price of 135 U.S. dollar is a company that is performing very well.
NEUT27|There are no.
NEUT28|No yet reverser signal, but we can start sooner versus single because he's funny.
NEUT29|He looks like Aiden shoulders left, left, and right shoulders and or left right shoulder.
NEUT30|And then if the head so it's like Stardust.
NEUT31|Just old.
NEUT32|Let's see what's coming up in the next days anyway.
NEUT33|It's too late to go longer because we were supposed to go longer to get into this market six months ago.
BULL34|"Now I believe thanks, bye."""
