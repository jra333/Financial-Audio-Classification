NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, Jason Moser here with my friend Brendan Matthews."
NEUT1|Jason how's it going?
NEUT2|Great good so we are here for another ask a fool.
NEUT3|Except today it's two of us so I guess it's ask a fools.
NEUT4|That's alright.
NEUT5|I think we're not charging any extra for twice the answer.
NEUT6|Great perspective.
NEUT7|I love it today we're taking a question from Frank Anne Frank asks what is your foolish opinion on the best stocks for a dividend portfolio and we talk about stocks all day, every day.
NEUT8|Here and.
NEUT9|In dividends certainly are of interest, especially doesn't enjoy a cash dividend and everybody loves it, right?
NEUT10|What do you?
NEUT11|What are some of your favorite dividend stocks out there today?
NEUT12|So I'll give you my.
NEUT13|I'll start with my number one favorite and that's Kinder Morgan Inc. Symbol kmi.
NEUT14|So this is the parent company that owns the general partner interest for the sort of Kinder Morgan pipeline empire.
NEUT15|They pay a five point 1% dividend.
NEUT16|They've announced plans to grow that at nearly double digit rate over the long term, and I think that's probably my favorite dividend stock right now.
NEUT17|Alright, so you know I'm going to actually count on your energy there with a little technology and go with Apple, and I think the reason why is really an Apple has not been paying a dividend for that long, no, but I mean when you look at the Apple devices everywhere.
NEUT18|Nowadays the operating system everything that Apple does to reach out and touch our lives.
NEUT19|This is a cash machine and so it's not that big growth stock that it once wasn't Even so they're figuring out other ways to get that cash out to investors they have.
BULL20|They've ramped up a pretty pretty big share buyback plan, obviously.
BULL21|They have a dividend that's starting to creep up to that 3% yield now, which I think is encouraging.
BULL22|That will continue to grow over time, and so I think that if you're looking for a good long term stable dividend payer, I think Apple is actually pretty good shot.
NEUT23|OK, what about another one?
NEUT24|That's interesting, so you countered my energy stock with a with a tech stock.
NEUT25|I'm going to counter your big well known exciting stock with a very small boring stock, so this is safety insurance group.
NEUT26|It's a small insurance provider.
NEUT27|They provide car insurance, basically in Massachusetts, in the New England area.
NEUT28|And they are very good under writers.
NEUT29|They make profits on most of the policies they write, and that allows them to pay very good dividends.
BULL30|So they pay a four point 3% dividend, and I think that's a steady dividend with a little bit of potential for growth.
BULL31|That's good, so you get three names, their stable dividend payers with plenty of room for growth, so you can see that dividend grow over time, which I think is obviously priority there, especially for long term investors like us fools.
NEUT32|So, great question, Frank.
BULL33|Thanks Brendan for those pics there, and certainly from information.
