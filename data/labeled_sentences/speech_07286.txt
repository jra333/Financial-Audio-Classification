BULL3|Twitter had a wildly good first day on the New York Stock Exchange, the stock closing its first day of trading at around $45.00 or nearly 73% above its IPO price.
NEUT4|Of course, the IPO price was only available to institutional investors and others lucky enough to get the stock before the public debut.
NEUT5|That said, we're going to play the.
NEUT6|Would've should've could've game.
NEUT7|What if you had invested $1000 at the IPO price of some of America's hottest tech stocks?
NEUT8|How much money would you have now?
NEUT9|Let's start with Twitter that 1000 bucks if you could have gotten in at $26, would now be worth around $1700.
NEUT10|Facebook in May of 2012.
NEUT11|If you dropped a grand on the social network on its opening day, you would like where you are now.
NEUT12|Your investment worth just under $1300.
NEUT13|Linkedin's IPO was in 2011.
NEUT14|But today you have Quinn tuple that your money Google that $1000 is grown since 2004 to over $12,000.
NEUT15|Yahoo went public back in 1996.
NEUT16|Now you'd have $61,000, Yahoo indeed eBay, you'd have $69,000.
NEUT17|But if you had a time machine, the place to take it would be nineteen, $97,000 on Amazon.com and you now have a 200 and $39,000.
NEUT18|So does that mean you better hurry up and drop 1000 bucks on Twitter?
NEUT19|Well, investors are all convinced.
NEUT20|It's a sure bet that's for sure.
NEUT21|The company has yet to turn a profit.
NEUT22|It's investing heavily.
BULL23|Still in technology, the company brought in around 1/2 billion dollars in revenue in the past 12 months.
NEUT24|And at the end of its first day of trading, the company now has a market value of around $30 billion.
NEUT25|Here's how the revenue from other brand name companies like Best Buy, Macy's, Netflix and Delta compared to Twitter and also divided on how much and how fast Twitter will grow.
NEUT26|Don't expect too much if you missed out on these big winners.
NEUT27|I mean, if you could put 1000 bucks on Zynga two years ago now all you have is about $350.00.
NEUT28|"That's the short answer."""
