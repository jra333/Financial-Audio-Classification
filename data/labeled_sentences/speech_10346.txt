NEUT0|"""In other words, just paint that make us become the ultimate changing of the guard, but you might have missed it if you're not as plugged into what's happening with the younger generation for so many young investors."
NEUT1|Love made money by running them all over the Internet.
NEUT2|I want you to see what they say to me.
NEUT3|I want you to consider me the world's unlikeliest avatar of youth culture.
NEUT4|First, these new investors don't understand the appeal of index funds.
NEUT5|You can't get rich with them if you wait for the S&P 500 to admit Tesla, which they talk about all the time you missed the best movie of your life.
NEUT6|The most interesting stocks might be gathered into ETF baskets that they experiment with, but mostly they prefer to do homework on individual names themselves, 'cause they know how to research on the Internet.
NEUT7|And yes, the by kolles OK. Is that really a sin?
NEUT8|Only if you do it, you're responsibly, they're doing it pretty well.
NEUT9|As far as I can tell, stock picking.
NEUT10|Maybe a law start for most people over 30.
NEUT11|But these kids are bringing it back second.
NEUT12|They hate being told what to do.
NEUT13|They know the smartest people in the world.
NEUT14|Don't go to Wall Street anymore.
NEUT15|They either try to break in at a tech company or start their own business is not normal, requires lots of capital, which is everyone making a killing on Instagram or shop fire.
NEUT16|SUV starts a business.
NEUT17|Not to mention the businesses that get financing from Square.
NEUT18|These aren't just cute developments, people.
BEAR19|The stock market in the Internet have freed millions of young people from their proverbial chains.
NEUT20|We've now got a whole generation of younger adults who were basically raised by the World Wide Web, and I think we underestimate how empowering it is and how smart they are and how much they've learned from it.
NEUT21|Third, these younger stock pickers, while they're having a great year, we've heard over and over again that the pandemic accelerated the digitization of industry by 5 or even seven years, maybe 10 years.
NEUT22|Some of that's because of cloud adoption.
NEUT23|But a lot of us, simply because the Internet gives you cheaper, smarter ways of doing things.
NEUT24|There's a whole wave of companies that exist to help you harness the power of the web without a computer science degree.
NEUT25|Here, by the way, that is actually the secret sauce behind Salesforce behind Snowflake or Zoom.
NEUT26|You don't need to be a tech genius anymore yet, just need a smartphone.
BEAR27|The news about the pandemic has played out in their favorite too early this year.
NEUT28|The pessimist warned us that it could take ages to get a functional vector vaccine, but between all the drug companies that got to work on it and all the government's throwing money at the problem, we have a bunch of vaccines very, very soon.
NEUT29|Why is that good news for younger investors?
NEUT30|Because they're so collectively lacking in cynicism that they've been willing to buy the stocks of companies that will make a fortune once we beat covid.
NEUT31|Why don't we just talk about one?
NEUT32|OK, I'll just pick one.
NEUT33|Well, I've been recommending Norwegian cruise.
NEUT34|OK, we've got a double here because I believe in management, and I know that they can borrow money all the money they want Wall Street, cynics, see the cruise lines is hobbled.
BEAR35|Companies weighed down by excessive bond issuance, included equity offerings.
NEUT36|But they've been dead wrong for the last four months, yet, you know, when they're going to start like it, I'll tell you one.
NEUT37|When they do what I did last night, I saw an ad for Norwegian cruise lines watching the NFL.
NEUT38|I mean they got it had already.
NEUT39|It wouldn't spend that kind of money from betting on a big comeback.
NEUT40|Finally, these younger investors believe in environmental sustainability, not just as an ethos, but as a business model.
NEUT41|They know there's money in cleaner energy.
NEUT42|They like electric vehicles and hydrogen fuel cells.
NEUT43|They take companies seriously when they talk about going green.
NEUT44|Remember, they lack cynicism.
NEUT45|They do their own research and decide whether to trust.
NEUT46|Or not trust when they trust they pull the trigger.
