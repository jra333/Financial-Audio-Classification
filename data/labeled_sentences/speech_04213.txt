NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Mike cluster with The Motley Fool."
BEAR1|Everyone is focused on stocks right now, but another market has far graver risks.
NEUT2|Joining me to talk is Dan Caplinger.
NEUT3|Hi Dan.
NEUT4|Hi Mike.
NEUT5|So where is the biggest risk to investors right now?
BEAR6|You know everybody's looking at the stock market right now, especially since it's been down so sharply this past week, but the greater long term risk is actually in the bond market because the risk of interest rates starting to rise as the economy recovers is really great.
NEUT7|Alot of investors don't even realize it.
BEAR8|But bonds can actually lose value when interest rates rise, and I think that a lot of investors aren't prepared to see the losses in their portfolios that could result from higher rates in their bond portfolios.
NEUT9|It sounds like a definite risk.
NEUT10|What could cause a bond market collapse?
BULL11|Well, the first step is for the economy to start recovering more strongly.
BEAR12|At that point, there's going to be upward pressure on interest rates, and the Federal Reserve is going to be pressured to go ahead and allow those rates to start to rise.
BEAR13|That in turn is going to hurt bond prices.
BEAR14|It's also going to hurt companies that have they've relied on low interest rates.
NEUT15|Some of the most popular are mortgage rates companies like Annaly Capital like American Capital Agency that have profited from those low rates they could see declines and dividend yields.
BEAR16|That could really hurt their investment.
BEAR17|Yeah, that could be a serious problem.
NEUT18|So what should bond investors do?
NEUT19|Well, that is the key to surviving as a bond investor in a period of rising rates is to keep your investments short term if possible.
NEUT20|Unfortunately, that's not what a lot of bond investors do.
NEUT21|They tend to favor ETS with really long exposure.
NEUT22|ETF's like the I shares Barclays Aggregate Bond like the I shares 20 plus year Treasury bond.
BEAR23|Those are going to take some of the biggest losses.
NEUT24|On the other hand, if you decide that you want to bet on the direction of bond.
BEAR25|Price is falling.
NEUT26|There are doing it somewhat dangerous ways that you can get trapped and I really don't recommend that.
NEUT27|People use the leverage ETF.
NEUT28|Pro shares Ultrashort 20 plus year Treasury bond ETF.
NEUT29|That's just too risky a move.
BEAR30|Even if bond interest rates start to rise, that could still be a problem.
BULL31|Excellent, great information.
BULL32|Thanks Dan.
