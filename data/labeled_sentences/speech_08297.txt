NEUT0|"""Washington is considering a new rule that would force and he would be domestic airline passenger to pass a COVID-19 test before being allowed to board the plane."
NEUT1|This ridiculous idea shouldn't get off the runway.
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL3|We get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT4|Uncle Sam is mulling a proposal that will require a negative COVID-19 test for all domestic airline travelers.
NEUT5|Such a rule is unneeded and harmful.
NEUT6|It won't make airline travel safer.
NEUT7|There have hardly been any documented cases here, and the rest of the world for that matter of the disease being spread aboard an aircraft.
NEUT8|Planes these days constantly refresh on board.
NEUT9|Air flow in addition, passengers have to wear face masks.
BEAR10|This kind of dictat will dampen air travel.
BEAR11|The industry has been battered by the lockdowns.
NEUT12|Airlines are still alive only because they've received 10s of billions of dollars from uncle's and slamming carriers even more for no good reason makes no sense at all.
BEAR13|In fact, it would hurt the fight against COVID-19.
NEUT14|Travel by car as an alternative to going somewhere instead of by airplane for any distance that would require stops for gasoline, food and trips to the restroom.
NEUT15|All opportunities for getting the virus.
NEUT16|Not to mention staying overnight at a hotel or motel.
BEAR17|The rule would divert resources and personnel from more pressing needs, primarily getting the vaccines distributed and testing vulnerable people.
NEUT18|The CDC still wants to stay home bound.
NEUT19|Forget it by summer, 10s of millions of people have been vaccinated.
BEAR20|Americans are wary pandemic related restrictions and lockdowns.
NEUT21|They yearned to let loose in a few months.
NEUT22|They will travel with a vengeance, whether bureaucrats like it or not.
NEUT23|Why unnecessarily hinder this liberating economy boosting outburst of activity?
NEUT24|Such an ill conceived rule should be grounded.
NEUT25|I'm Steve Forbes.
