NEUT0|"""Good morning guys and welcome back to my Daily portfolio update."
NEUT1|This is Fernando Herrera and today we're going to be recording the last video of this series for the year, so I got some pretty interesting pics that you guys definitely want to look at and don't forget also to hit that like button and subscribe.
NEUT2|Thank you so much now, let's begin first talk we got.
BEAR3|Is Coca Cola now Coca Cola is 6% down for 2020.
NEUT4|According to barrons.
BEAR5|Now compared to competitor Pepsi, Coca Cola sold less in the pandemic year in that.
BEAR6|The fact that Coke's business comes more twords events an restaurants now with this being said, their stock and company performance was impacted.
BULL7|But we do expect a big comeback for Coca Cola for 2021, so this is definitely a good stock to keep in mind for the upcoming year.
NEUT8|Now the next stock we want to talk about is Walmart.
NEUT9|This is also by and despite their lawsuit with the Department of Justice for playing a role in the opioid crisis, nothing tangible has really changed about Walmart in case they even lose the lawsuit.
BULL10|It's possible that they might be subject to fines, but Walmart will still continue to have a strong presence in the market.
NEUT11|Consumer behavior is very unlikely to pretty much change and Wall Street right now is punishing this stock, making it a very attractive stock to enter next is Apple, as Jim Cramer always says, own it.
NEUT12|Don't trade it.
BULL13|Apple, like other companies, have such potential, one being the most valued company in the world gives them flexibility's now with their Apple one plus membership, we should see an increase in service revenue.
BULL14|And finally there EV project or collaborations can bring additional excitement to the company, so there's definitely an interesting stock to own now.
NEUT15|Finally, we have Boeing and this is also by the BA 737.
BULL16|Max is back in business with American Airlines has been cleared from any US restrictions and orders for more airlines have kicked in, so 2021 is definitely a great year for Boeing and I would definitely recommend you to buy it now.
NEUT17|Lastly, to go over or daily portfolio update.
NEUT18|These are our top movers today.
BULL19|We have plug number one with some great return today, specifically jumping to $33 per share.
NEUT20|I mean that's crazy.
BEAR21|We also have a Seattle genetics as their biggest loser now in terms of other pretty much losers.
NEUT22|We got fascinating Facebook but really overall guys I did not have any activity.
NEUT23|I have not been buying anything at all right now I've only been receiving a few dividends here as you guys can see now this is.
NEUT24|The last day that I'm going to be doing the Daily Portfolio update series for the year 2020 an so it's amazing how Disney is probably going to come up on top test line plug.
BULL25|But I mean we pad only deposited $5000 an were most likely going to end up roughly around $5500 for the end of the year, making that a great profit of $500 within a five month period.
BEAR26|Now the stock market has been very volatile and it has been going up significantly.
NEUT27|But we're very excited and I'm very excited to see what 2021 holds.
BULL28|I do appreciate all the support and all the help that all of you guys have given me by watching these videos and commenting.
