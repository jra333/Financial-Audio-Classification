BEAR0|"""Of Disney's getting kicked around today because part of Mulan was shot in the Singings Province and at the end of the movie there's a credit that thanks the government."
NEUT1|I mean, that's that's a legit story.
NEUT2|Today in The Hollywood Reporter, she said, that's actually.
NEUT3|Darkening another story that was unbelievable.
NEUT4|Which is this Disney upgrade for Deutsche Bank, but they talk about spinning off yes PN an ABC David, this is your neck of the Woods.
NEUT5|Should a credit to the Chinese Communist government undo a Deutsche Bank?
NEUT6|Note that basically says it's the Holy Land.
NEUT7|We're just gonna have.
BEAR8|Plus and then all that ESPN stuff where they seem to lose a lot of viewers.
NEUT9|Yeah, the idea being that as they say, Disney goes all in on streaming and Disney succeeding in the land grab phase of direct to consumer.
NEUT10|We know that's the case.
NEUT11|That has been the way the stock has been judged to a certain extent.
BEAR12|One reason why it's only really down 9%, which if I told you the beginning of this horrible pandemic, Disney would only be down 9% given its exposure to so much of the bad things going on.
NEUT13|You might have said, wow, that would be I will take it.
NEUT14|Jim, I don't know whether they have.
NEUT15|Well.
NEUT16|First of all, companies consider all sorts of things.
NEUT17|I've no idea whether they've ever considered what they're what they're discussing there, but you know the idea being that you would have a very significant cash flow producing asset that might at least attract some shareholders.
NEUT18|For that, you could perhaps put a big dividend on it for some time.
NEUT19|I don't know.
NEUT20|Maybe who knows?
NEUT21|"People come up with these kinds of things all the time, but it does point to the strength of the direct to consumer."""
