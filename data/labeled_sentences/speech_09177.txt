NEUT0|"""Well, let's pick up on that conversation that 'cause I know you've been watching the Bitcoin news very closely."
NEUT1|I mean, this is sort of the typical swings that we've seen in the cryptocurrency space, right?
NEUT2|We're talking about $60,000 potentially over the weekend.
NEUT3|And then here we are talking about coming under that $50,000 mark.
NEUT4|I do think it's interesting we were talking speaking to Dan Ives about this earlier about the context with which we're discussing this now in terms of the swings, Elon Musk's comments.
NEUT5|Potentially part of the moves and then now you're seeing Tesla on the back.
BULL6|End of that, seeing a big swing in their stock because of the significant position they've taken in Bitcoin.
NEUT7|Yeah, that's going to happen when you have close to 10% of your cash and cash equivalents.
BULL8|Tide up in Bitcoin, so that's not completely unexpected.
NEUT9|What might be unexpected is maybe connecting the dots and saying that shirt.
NEUT10|Elon musks.
NEUT11|Tweet here might be the main driver.
NEUT12|Just because you know, it's not as if it's the same thing as him calling his own stock too expensive, which of course we saw happen in May of 2020 and now we're seeing his tweet here saying that Bitcoin might be too high, but people are pointing out, you know when he when he did say Tesla stock may be too pricey.
BEAR13|Back in May, the stock fell by about 10% that day, but over the course of the next year, it's up more than 400%, so not necessarily the best and maybe timing some of these things, so maybe people putting too much weight into an Elon Musk tweet.
BEAR14|Of course, we've talked about Bitcoin running hot.
NEUT15|These pull backs aren't necessarily out of the ordinary, so I would just stress that you know might be leaning too much.
NEUT16|We might be reading too much into maybe Elon controlling the movements here.
NEUT17|This is kind of a natural will see where it goes, but at 52, still not necessarily crazy, just basically giving back.
NEUT18|Some of that rally over the weekend, but I don't know the rest of the sphere trading around this to Binance coin we highlighted that on Friday giving back a lot of the games that defied tokens giving back a lot of the gains perhaps necessary you know.
NEUT19|Necessary correction here and keep the show.
NEUT20|We call it that.
BULL21|Yeah, and it was also interesting.
NEUT22|We got those comments from JP Morgan talking about the limited liquid ITI that's in the market and as a result of that with Bitcoin, even the smallest flows, at least according to the strategist there can have a significant impact.
NEUT23|And that's something of course to keep in mind for Bitcoin, because it's not an infinite amount that we're talking about.
NEUT24|Yeah, and I mean the other thing that we stressed over the weekend and my conversations is we're still waiting to hear.
NEUT25|Kind of the update.
NEUT26|Won't see what Gary Gensler, incoming head of the SEC has to say about some of these things.
BEAR27|'cause you're still locked out as Americans from some of the more interesting crypto projects.
NEUT28|China, being a lot more friendly.
BULL29|I know you've been focusing in on some updates out of China as well.
BULL30|That's the best transition I can make here.
NEUT31|"Could go."""
