NEUT0|"""Good morning, and today we're talking about Tesla stock."
NEUT1|Do you like these kind of videos?
NEUT2|Charting videos please?
NEUT3|Like and subscribe.
NEUT4|The best part about subscribing?
NEUT5|It's absolutely free.
NEUT6|I have mentioned a lot about in terms of having.
NEUT7|You know when you have some type of support resistance line in conjunction with another support slash resistance line, but that's usually a good place to have target points.
NEUT8|So like I mentioned a couple of days ago and that's why I like.
NEUT9|You know that 380 mark as my bye.
NEUT10|Where is really three?
NEUT11|8465 is where I had it.
NEUT12|If I was looking at doing some form of potential short term or long term swing trade.
BEAR13|Since then, we've actually had a couple of days where we've gapped up, and even this morning were gapping up.
NEUT14|Given I don't have a crystal ball, I can't tell you what's going to happen, but we're definitely up here.
BEAR15|We definitely have broke down this.
BULL16|This trend line, which I said if we broke here then I could see us run up here and then we did find some resistance here yesterday.
NEUT17|It was a quick run up, right?
NEUT18|I mean we opened up at 400 and ran all the way up to 427.
NEUT19|So 20 point move.
NEUT20|And one hour appear.
BEAR21|And gapped up.
NEUT22|In terms of how stocks charting, I mean, if I had to.
NEUT23|Give some guidance and.
NEUT24|You know, I would say.
NEUT25|We would be looking at.
NEUT26|For this move.
NEUT27|And this is copper seeming to me that this is like a lot of stocks that I'm I've seen over the past couple days where all of them are coming to another major resistance line.
BULL28|And it looks like we may hit it today.
NEUT29|I just be cautious.
NEUT30|I'm, you know, in any type of my trades or suggestions, you know, my recommendation is if you have a target point, I would sell a portion of that trade, 'cause if something could be get announced today that there's going to be a big issue that can cause another pullback in the market.
NEUT31|Just be cautious out there.
NEUT32|We already pie in terms of you know it's almost a 50 point difference from where we were just a few days ago, but when you said if you're looking at trading.
NEUT33|You know a lot of stocks in terms of you know they'll go down at some point.
NEUT34|You know they'll move down a little bit.
NEUT35|Almost in you know.
BEAR36|Every morning though, the move down.
NEUT37|Not always it.
NEUT38|It may be just a quick move too, so, but this is where we're at.
NEUT39|I, you know, I could see us heading up to around 4:40.
NEUT40|You know, five really before we find some resistance.
NEUT41|But we have this line that we regained.
NEUT42|It could potentially be support, but we'll see how it goes.
NEUT43|Like I said, there's a lot of risk out there in terms of the election.
NEUT44|I recommend being safe if you like these type of videos, please let me know.
NEUT45|Please let you know which you liked, what you don't like, maybe what you want.
BULL46|Yeah, you guys have a good day.
BULL47|"Thank you so much."""
