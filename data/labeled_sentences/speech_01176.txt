NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Mike and tell it to talk about BlackBerry."
NEUT1|The stock trades on the NYSE under symbol BB.
BEAR2|Now BlackBerry was down over 41% and this was due to BlackBerry being one of those stocks that was getting pumped up by Wall Street bets to take advantage of a short squeeze situation and you see that the stock here over the past couple of days rose from 7 all the way up to 25 and then move back down.
BEAR3|And this was due to BlackBerry being one of several stocks to be restricted on several trading platforms and because of that.
NEUT4|You could only close your position.
NEUT5|You can open a new position.
BULL6|However, Robin Hood did announce that they're going to allow a limited buying of stocks tomorrow, so that creates the possibility that BlackBerry could rise, and I do think all these stocks across the board, GameStop, AMC, and BlackBerry may get some buying coming in tomorrow.
BEAR7|Just because when these stocks all came down dramatically in two, it looks like somebody is going to be available now.
NEUT8|I want to talk a little bit about Wall Street bets and these stocks in particular because I do think these stocks will rise.
NEUT9|However, I just don't know if you're going to have like free and Fair Trading of these stocks like BlackBerry, AMC, or GameStop.
BULL10|I think they're good for a temporary bounce, but I think they may.
BEAR11|If these stocks begin to run up really high again, they're going to shut down the ability to open in these positions.
NEUT12|Now Robin Hood's position Robotoids explanation as to why they did not allow trading is that they have financial obligations to handle when it comes to the clearing of stocks now.
NEUT13|I don't totally believe that because they did not really restrict any trading when it came to the March 20th Pandemic Crash when you had trading volumes that exceptional levels across just about every equity.
NEUT14|They didn't really restrict trading, so the fact that they were restricting trading on a couple of stocks I just don't believe that Robin Hood didn't have the financial.
NEUT15|Wherewithal to handle all of the bind.
NEUT16|I don't know.
NEUT17|I don't totally believe it, but I do know that Apex clearing which handles Robin Hood Weibel, a couple of other platforms.
NEUT18|There were the ones who also.
NEUT19|Were the ones that were struck Ting the clearing of these stocks.
NEUT20|So Apex clearing is also partially responsible.
NEUT21|However, if Blackberries able to trade tomorrow, I think out of the four out of like AMC, GameStop, BlackBerry and cost.
BULL22|I think BlackBerry actually has the best chance to give you some really nice returns if you just want to short term trade.
NEUT23|So I would definitely check out BlackBerry again.
NEUT24|It trades on the NYSE under the symbol BB.
