NEUT0|"""So the question with Disney."
NEUT1|The question with Disney is, is it going to be a business that can thrive for the next 5-10 years?
NEUT2|And if it's going to be able to thrive then it has to become a digital first business and last year to Disney's credit they announced, you know, the introduction of streaming with Disney Plus and so investors got excited.
NEUT3|The stock did well but of late over the last month or so, Disney has been showing movie theaters, some love and movie theaters.
NEUT4|That's kind of old economy type stuff that's anti digital.
NEUT5|So investors are kind of get a little hesitant because they're like hey Disney, you told us you were putting digital right at the forefront, but through your actions, your condo, you know sending us a message that you're not really serious.
NEUT6|You know you're kind of like lukewarm on this whole idea, you know?
NEUT7|So this doc, you know, has, you know, hasn't really been performing?
NEUT8|But yesterday, Disney announced a reorganization of its business where it's putting Disney Plus.
BULL9|Knew this new economy streaming service at the center of its business so investors are excited the stock gapped up this morning.
NEUT10|It looks to be holding the gap, so let's look at the options flow an option sonar to get a sense of the bets at the big boys are making alright, so here we are on options.
NEUT11|So now we're analyzing Disney so.
NEUT12|Let's Scroll down and let's first take a look at the activity that I notice this morning.
NEUT13|Specifically, the trades expiring for November, right?
NEUT14|So the 150 strike for Novembers those got some love this morning and also the 140 strike for November.
BULL15|Also got some love.
NEUT16|I also saw love going to the 1:30 strike calls that expire at the end of October, right?
NEUT17|And also the 1:40 in the one 36131 strike calls that expire at the end of next week, right?
NEUT18|So those were the calls that they got some love.
NEUT19|Also, I notice that there was a player right that was putting some big money down.
NEUT20|I'm talking about big money down an options that expire at the March of 2021.
NEUT21|So right here expiration March.
NEUT22|21 but 600,000 forty 4064 thousand sixty 7100 two 112, and so on.
NEUT23|Pretty much the trader has been accumulating by these calls throughout the day.
NEUT24|OK, so when I first saw this, I saw like these four right.
NEUT25|And then I checked back 5 minutes later than I.
NEUT26|So like these six, and now I'm checking now and obviously like these 10 or 11, right?
NEUT27|So this trader.
NEUT28|Is in here consistently buying these Disney calls that expire in March of 2021 strike being 135, so when you put it together right Disney saying yes investors, we are a digital first business.
BULL29|We're going to thrive in the next 5 to 10 years.
NEUT30|We're committed to making content and putting that content on Disney.
NEUT31|Plus if you look at the options flow, investors are believing it.
