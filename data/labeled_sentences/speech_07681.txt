NEUT1|You have said that you like franchise companies.
NEUT2|Companies that have their castles surrounded by moats companies that are possible too.
NEUT3|You can have some prediction 5-10 years down the road.
NEUT4|But aren't businesses like?
NEUT5|Sees candy, the furniture business.
NEUT6|The Urubus this the shoe business business that are hard to predict the future 5-10 years down the road.
NEUT7|The last part of them aren't these businesses hard to predict 5 or 10 years down the road.
NEUT8|Things like shoe business and I think they're far easier to predict than most businesses.
NEUT9|I. I think I can come closer.
NEUT10|To telling you the future of virtually all of the businesses we have and not just because we have him.
NEUT11|I mean if they belong to somebody else.
NEUT12|Then if I if I took the Dow 30.
NEUT13|Excluding the ones we own or with or you know, the 1st 100 companies alphabetically on the New York Stock Exchange.
NEUT14|I think they're I think cars are way easier.
NEUT15|To protect their their their.
NEUT16|They are fair.
NEUT17|They tend to be fundamental things fairly simple.
BULL18|Rate of change is not not fast, so I I feel pretty.
NEUT19|Pretty comfortable, I think when you look at at Berkshire five years from now.
NEUT20|The businesses we have now.
BULL21|Will be performing pretty much as we've anticipated at this time.
NEUT22|I hope there's some new ones and I hope their big ones, but I don't think that will have had lots of surprises in the president.
NEUT23|My guess is will have had one surprise.
NEUT24|I don't know what it will be, but I mean you know that happens in life, but but there won't be a series of them, whereas if you if we were to buy.
NEUT25|We owned a base metals business or or many many retailing businesses I can think of.
NEUT26|An auto business.
NEUT27|I'm not sure I know where we would stand in the competitive pecking order.
NEUT28|5 or 10 years from now at.
NEUT29|I would not want to.
NEUT30|Try and come in an.
NEUT31|Display sees candies, for example in the business it does that or the Furniture Mart.
NEUT32|It's just.
NEUT33|It's not an easy job, so I. I don't think you'll get lots of surprises.
NEUT34|With the present businesses of Berkshire.
NEUT35|"But the key is is developing more of them."""
