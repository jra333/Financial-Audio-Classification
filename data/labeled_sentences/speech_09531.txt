NEUT9|The company works with shipping transportation services.
NEUT10|There is dry bulk vessels.
NEUT11|The company offers seaborne transportation services for dry bulk cargo, including iron ore.
BULL12|Call Grane along with other things the company has been expanding pretty quickly as I've recently been purchasing more and more ships, and I think this is a great reopening play, 'cause I think the stock could easily see 3 to $5 by the end of the year if not higher with the company adding additional ships, the fleet will now have a total of 14 ships.
BULL13|Now if we look at the price action, the stock in the past three months is up about 524% going from about $0.16 that currently being $1.03 and recently back on February 11th we saw the stock reach a high of a dollar.
BEAR14|$0.25 before pulling back all the way to a low of $0.65 and then recovering back up to where we currently are a little bit over a dollar.
NEUT15|The company also recently announced the ship purchase, which was to buy 2011 Japanese built dry bulk carrier for a purchase price of $16.85 million.
BULL16|The delivery of this ship should be between the second and third quarter of this year and this ship will expand the company's fleet to 14 ships.
BULL17|This is now the company's 8th ship purchase this year and along with this they also announced the successful delivery of their first two tanker purchases.
NEUT18|Once the company has all the ships delivered that they've ordered, they'll now have 14 ships in their fleet, including one capsize.
BULL19|11 drybulk vessels and two tankers, so we've already seen some big moves from the company this year.
NEUT20|If you're looking at something to hold for a longer term recovery play, this company is the way to go in my opinion.
NEUT21|My personal price target is $4 by the end of the year, but I really think we could see anywhere from 3 to $10.
NEUT22|I'm personally planning to add more shares tomorrow and market open.
NEUT23|Especially if we see a dip.
NEUT24|But what do you guys think about this penny stock?
