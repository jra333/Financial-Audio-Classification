NEUT0|"""I wanted to ask you, so you're back in Detroit and I know this is where you found your company smile."
NEUT1|Direct club.
NEUT2|Yeah, can you talk to me about what it's like to be back here right now?
NEUT3|Yeah, it's Detroit's home for Jordan.
NEUT4|I swear the company started.
NEUT5|You want to be back with the Forbes 30 under 30 event is just humbling in the same breath of some of the people that are here today.
NEUT6|And you know, Jordan, I we started the company in 2014.
NEUT7|We met at summer Camp and we both had a full mouth of metal wired braces which I don't know if you had truly a miserable experience.
NEUT8|So as Jordan I grew up in Detroit and became business partners, we were reflecting back on that pain point in our youth and we figure there just has to be a better way to go about this.
NEUT9|So we actually came across some HHS data and it showed that 6 out of 10 US counties don't have access to an orthodontist, so the opportunity became pretty apparent for us that we could connect state license, dentist, and orthodontist.
BULL10|These millions of people that could benefit from a straighter smile that there were opportunity to help people.
NEUT11|So we set out to democratize orthodontics and pioneered the world's first teledentistry platform.
NEUT12|It's a date we've helped over 750,000 people get a smile that they love.
NEUT13|What's your?
NEUT14|What's your biggest tip that you're going to give?
NEUT15|The people who are attending this summit then the biggest tip I would say is you know patience.
NEUT16|You know, if you're an entrepreneur, I have really 3 core values.
NEUT17|I look at one is, you know the.
NEUT18|Vision what are you setting out to accomplish?
NEUT19|What intrinsic value?
NEUT20|Bringing your customers on?
NEUT21|What differences are going to make on the world?
NEUT22|I would say to the execution you know the lifeblood of any company, any successful companies, your ability to execute.
NEUT23|I actually have a Thomas Edison quote on my desk that says vision without execution is just hallucination and then passion.
NEUT24|You know, passion is what fuels that execution.
NEUT25|So when you're starting a company from scratch again, there's so many.
NEUT26|Opposing forces is easy to give up.
NEUT27|I would say the passions that grip to keep going.
BULL28|"Yeah, well thank you so much for speaking with us today."""
