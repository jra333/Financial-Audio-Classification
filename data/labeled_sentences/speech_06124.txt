BULL0|"""Hey fools, I'm Austin Smith and in honor of worldwide invest better day, we're recapping the 13 steps that you can take today to become a better, more foolish investor."
NEUT1|Now up right now is step number one.
NEUT2|Change your life with one calculation, and that calculation is X * 1 + I to the NTH power where X is the money you're imputing.
NEUT3|I is the interest rate you're earning on that.
NEUT4|In North is a period of time that you're investing.
NEUT5|Now, these three factors, the amount invested, the rate of return and the time allowed for that money to grow will literally change your life, and it's going to result in compound interest, which is arguably one of the most powerful forces in the universe, and certainly the most powerful force in generating your wealth.
NEUT6|Look at this hypothetical scenario.
NEUT7|If you have $1200 invested once in four common investment vehicles with different horizons, let's say you have a savings account earning half a percent, a money market fund earning about 2%, a certificate of deposit earning 5% or stocks earning 9% a year.
NEUT8|Now these rates may seem a little bit ambitious as rates are low across the board, but.
NEUT9|Take a look at long term averages and there about fair.
NEUT10|Now the results 40 years out that savings account would only grow to about $1465.
BULL11|The Money Market Fund would have grown to about $2600.
BEAR12|The CD about $8400 and the stock market trounces them at $37,600.
NEUT13|Now let's scale it up a little bit.
NEUT14|What happens if you invest $1200 each year where your savings account would have jumped to $54,000 a year?
BULL15|The Money market fund were grown to $76,000 a year.
NEUT16|Year, the Certificate of Deposit 160,000 and the money you invested in stocks $480,000, half $1,000,000 on $100 a month commitment.
NEUT17|That's less than most cell phone bills and that's the power of compound interest.
NEUT18|You earn a reasonable rate of return over a long enough horizon.
NEUT19|Your money will literally print money for itself, so that's all for step one.
NEUT20|Make sure you check out the other 12 steps we've outlined on our worldwide Invest Better Day homepage.
BULL21|"Thanks a lot and Foulon."""
