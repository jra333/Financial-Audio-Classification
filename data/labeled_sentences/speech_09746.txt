NEUT0|"""Paul, should we look at fiber first?"
NEUT1|This is an interesting company and Paul, why don't we look at what's going on with fire?
NEUT2|What is the market cap for this puppy?
NEUT3|Alright, my is my screen shared yeah go ahead.
NEUT4|Alright, well look at this.
BEAR5|First off the chart.
BEAR6|I mean it was the market downturn.
NEUT7|It was at $23.00 a share.
BULL8|Now it's it got us high as 223.
NEUT9|That's 10 times more in a matter of eight months.
NEUT10|$6.8 billion company, it was 680,000,000 just 8-9 months ago.
NEUT11|No PBX there.
NEUT12|Not a shock.
NEUT13|New company.
BEAR14|I thought it would be a money loser to start in last 14 million last year.
BEAR15|So it has a negative profit margin.
NEUT16|So 2X is to start.
NEUT17|But look at this gross profit stuff.
NEUT18|83% gross profit?
BULL19|That's pretty high wow OK Pillar #3 is revenue growth.
BULL20|Paul we want to see that revenue growing over the past five years baby.
NEUT21|Well they don't.
NEUT22|They don't have five years of history.
NEUT23|They have three years.
NEUT24|We have 52 million 207 and in the last 12 months we've got 163.
BULL25|So it's growing quite fast.
NEUT26|That's adopted.
BULL27|Big check Mark there.
BEAR28|How about profit all pillar #4 profit growth is an X here because it lost 19 million and in last 33.54 million.
NEUT29|In the last four year, but let's see the last 12 months, it has only lost 14 million, so you can make the argument to check, but will still keep it as an ex.
NEUT30|Just 'cause we're trying to stay consistent.
NEUT31|OK, how about Bill #5?
NEUT32|Pauls shares outstanding folks who want this number going down.
NEUT33|Now I don't know if you see it, but 25.6 down to 20.5 million shares, so that's a check mark there.
NEUT34|Are you surprised there buying shares back already, Paul?
NEUT35|You know, for such a big jump that quickly, I don't know what they did, but well, I mean, yeah, that is kind of surprising.
NEUT36|Who knows what happened?
NEUT37|Alright?
NEUT38|How about a pillar #6?
NEUT39|Is current assets greater than current liabilities but?
NEUT40|I have 300 eleven, 112 million and current assets, liabilities, and here's the good news.
NEUT41|Total current liabilities 126 all liabilities 130.
BULL42|So they have enough money by far to pay off all their debts completely, not just the current ones.
NEUT43|This is what we love to see.
NEUT44|It is hard for her to go under when they do that, so you subtract $3 million off their market cap, which isn't much 'cause they're 6.5 billion.
NEUT45|So whatever?
NEUT46|OK, how about Pillar #7, which is free cash flow growth?
NEUT47|Did they have a dividend?
NEUT48|Paula didn't even look.
BEAR49|They don't have a dividend, they keep going free cash flow game that fast flow free cash flow went from a negative 8 1/2 to a negative 15.6, so that's an X and there is no attachment.
NEUT50|There is no free cash flow so another X for the price of free cash flow.
NEUT51|Guys you know I'm gonna say this one.
NEUT52|This one is a hard one.
NEUT53|I mean price to sales of 40 to one.
NEUT54|I'm avoiding this at all costs.
NEUT55|Let them grow.
NEUT56|Let them be big with the stock going 2000.
NEUT57|I know it sounds crazy about this.
NEUT58|I'd rather not go to 2000.
NEUT59|And it be worth 2500 and we buy it then then then ride it from here to 2000.
NEUT60|I just don't.
NEUT61|I don't, I don't.
NEUT62|I'm not buying into this one right now guys.
NEUT63|We're currently talking bout fiver.
NEUT64|We're going over the eight pillar analysis.
NEUT65|They have no PE ratio.
BEAR66|Their profit margin is under 10%.
BULL67|They do have revenue growth.
NEUT68|They do not have profit growth.
BULL69|They are buying back shares and they have great assets over liabilities.
NEUT70|Current assets over liabilities.
NEUT71|Without that free cash flow and the price to be free cash flow or last two pillars.
NEUT72|Paul, this is basically a hype stock right?
NEUT73|I mean this is just like.
BULL74|Really based on times it it up 10 times in eight months.
NEUT75|I mean, there's only so much you can do with that, you know.
NEUT76|I mean, this would be the opposite of buying, buying low and selling hides.
BEAR77|Be buying hide this moment so it's a bit hard.
NEUT78|"No on final."""
