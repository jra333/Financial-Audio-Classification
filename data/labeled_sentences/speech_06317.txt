NEUT4|It means alot right?
NEUT5|Let's get straight on with the video.
NEUT6|As you can see here on Coca Cola stock graph.
BEAR7|Coca Cola really didn't have a good 2020.
BEAR8|They started the year with the share price at about $60.00 and dropped in March.
BEAR9|2 loads of nearly 3536% down.
BEAR10|Then the year about 15% down.
BEAR11|Or actually it was a bit less 'cause that's today the end of the year, only about 8% down.
BEAR12|But compared to the rest of the S&P 500 that Andy 2020, about 10% up.
BEAR13|This is an absolute terrible year for Coca Cola being 20% down compared to the S&P 500.
NEUT14|So why was this?
BEAR15|Well, Coca Cola was hit especially hard by the coronavirus pandemic as their business revolves a lot around their products being sold in venues like Movie, Cinemas, theme parks and bars.
NEUT16|As you can see they've got.
NEUT17|These are all the products that Coca Cola sell.
NEUT18|And it's normally drinks that you would buy if you're out you don't normally buy a bottle of water if you're at your home, and if we compare this to one of Coke's competitors.
NEUT19|In this sector, Pepsi, Pepsi have a lot more products that you consume at your house and don't consume at places like bars.
BEAR20|That's why Coke was hit harder than Pepsi and reported a loss in Q4 while Pepsi actually reported a growth in their earnings as they could earn more money from people buying their foods and buying their drinks to consume at home.
NEUT21|When Coke is much more reliant on these.
BEAR22|Big sales from venues like cinemas and theme parks so that had a massive hit on Coca Cola share price.
BULL23|But as you can see in the past few days and in the past week it is recovered a bit and this is because the vaccine rollout in the US and the UK and all around the world have given some hope to the Coca Cola business model as a hope.
BULL24|Is the vaccines rolled out, they'll be able to open up bars, restaurants and theme parks and start selling Cokes again and start selling all the different drinks they should give them a huge boost.
NEUT25|In their product sales and make Coca-Cola profitable once a day.
BULL26|Again, Coca Cola continues to pay pay a great dividend of 3.24%.
BULL27|This is up compared to the S&P 500 average of 2% and Coca Cola have been what?
BEAR28|$60.00 for in the past and they've been see before this drop.
BULL29|They're at $60.00 and they look quite comfortable at that price and they were on a steady incline over the past few years before this massive drop.
NEUT30|So I think Coca Cola can get back to it.
BEAR31|Endemic guys and they continue to be a difficult thinking.
BULL32|This is a great stock and I will be investing in Coca Cola if their share price goes back down a bit to that 49 mark as I love the dividend and I think it has great growth potential, it won't be the highest growth stock, but I think it's quite a safe bet.
NEUT33|However, I don't think it will really start going back up again until this is all over, so I'm waiting for the vaccine rollouts to be a bit more.
BEAR34|And like I said, Coca Cola stock price to drop that down a little bit so it's a nice nicer by under $50 or less.
NEUT35|Look to get it up.
NEUT36|So guys that was my Coca Cola stock with you.
