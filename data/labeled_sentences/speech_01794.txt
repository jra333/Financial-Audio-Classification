BULL0|"""Welcome back to power lunch."
NEUT1|I'm Seema Modi.
NEUT2|Disney could not have written a better comeback story.
BULL3|The stock back at all time highs after rally, more than 90% since the March lows.
BEAR4|The company is still facing a number of challenges.
BEAR5|It Sparks or under pressure an Warner Brothers decision to release all of its 2021 films to its streaming service, throwing a curveball for its blockbuster business.
NEUT6|Gina Sanchez of Chantico Global and Lido Advisors Bill Baruch, a blue line capital, joining me now to discuss and Gina Disney's Investor Day next week, was the number one thing.
NEUT7|We would like management to address, well, you know, I think that management has to address the fact that despite fantastic Disney plus subscribership 73 million very impressive, we still need to see a plan for how they're going to get their selves out of themselves out of this big hole that they have.
BEAR8|They've lost 62% in parks revenue, 51% in.
NEUT9|Studio revenue and we need to see sort of the plan to get up and out of that.
NEUT10|Vaccine distribution isn't expected until about mid year.
BULL11|Does that mean that their parks can get back up to full capacity during the summer months?
NEUT12|Those are the questions that need to be answered.
NEUT13|Yeah, in the meantime, Bill, it's direct to consumer segment.
BULL14|Disney Plus continues to do well.
BULL15|It's one of the reasons City upgraded the stock to a price target of 175 a share.
NEUT16|That's a street high, but where do you see the stock headed?
NEUT17|You're correct in in the streaming is done the heavy lifting, even before the pandemic in during it.
NEUT18|But make no mistake here.
NEUT19|This obviously is a reopening narrative.
NEUT20|I mean look what the stock did on March 9th.
BULL21|It surged out above that Pandemic September high, but it's continued to hold very good technical ground.
NEUT22|I like what I see technically an an.
NEUT23|I like buying pullbacks.
NEUT24|I mean you're getting a new record high today and I like buying things that are that are making record highs.
NEUT25|So if you do get a pullback I think you know there's a backstop now.
BULL26|135 area Big big, a lot of support.
BULL27|But again, you know this move here I. I think the streaming can can pave the way for continued momentum if the reopening narrative continues to trickle out, as we've seen, it's a little bit of vaccine trickle in the news that supportive overtime.
BULL28|And if we get that this will become a momentum stock breaking out above its previous record high.
NEUT29|Yeah, that reopening trade certainly seems to be working not just for Disney Carnival.
BEAR30|Marriott among others, will see even less Bill and Gina.
BULL31|"Thank you."""
