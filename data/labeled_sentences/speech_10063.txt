NEUT0|"""So Speaking of electric vehicles, there's a lot of components in them."
NEUT1|One that we spoke about a lot is the batteries which we just talked about.
NEUT2|But another thing that's really important is there's a magnet on every single electric motor, and all of these are really produced overseas in Asia right now, except for MP materials, which mines this rare earth magnet that goes on every single electric motor, whether it's in a car or a bus, whatever it is, if it has an electric motor, it needs this magnet.
BULL3|On it MP materials is MP materials is the only North American based company that makes these that minds this material in the stock price has been doing extremely well lately.
NEUT4|We've been speaking about it since it was less than $25 a share.
NEUT5|Now it's over $45.00 a share and recently the CEO of MP materials was on CNBC.
NEUT6|He had an interview, uh, you know, about two months ago, so that wasn't so recently.
NEUT7|Then just the other day.
NEUT8|Jim Cramer.
NEUT9|Also came out and spoke.
BEAR10|He said with all of the market volatility with the stock market going down.
NEUT11|A lot of these packs are taking pretty big hits.
NEUT12|He said once that he likes right now.
NEUT13|MP materials is one that he would buy.
BULL14|He said it's high quality, got very good management and people should be buying this on the pullback.
NEUT15|I currently own a couple thousand shares of it in MP materials.
NEUT16|What is just really important about it is that they're the only North American company that mines this rare.
NEUT17|Earth Magnet No other company in North America does it all.
BULL18|The other material comes from overseas in Asia and it's going to be important that we have a US based company that can mine and supply this magnet, especially as EV production ramps up over the next couple of years.
NEUT19|Important that we have a lot of supply in the US.
NEUT20|Same with batteries.
NEUT21|Same with this magnet.
NEUT22|All of these materials need to be in readily available for electric vehicle companies, so it's pretty important that we'll see that in the US, and I do really like MP materials.
BULL23|It's been going up recently even when the market has been going down.
NEUT24|So something to keep an eye on if you don't have it on.
NEUT25|"Your watch list already."""
