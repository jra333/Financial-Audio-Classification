NEUT0|"""Palantir stock analysis and price prediction, December 18th in today's Palantir stock analysis and price prediction."
BULL1|Palantir stock is in good shape.
NEUT2|All right, let's get started in a year when companies have gone public on little more than a kiss and a promise.
NEUT3|It's a little surprising that Palantir, NYSE PLT.
BEAR4|Our stock is so polarizing.
BEAR5|I suppose some investors can't get past the companies links to the Trump administration.
NEUT6|The company's co-founder, Peter Thiel, has close ties to President Donald Trump, however.
NEUT7|As I've previously noted, the company's CEO, Alex Karp, was also an ardent backer of Hillary Clinton.
BEAR8|The new administration will be a headwind to Palantir's revenue.
NEUT9|Again, I'm not so sure Palantir was doing business with the two prior administrations, so I'm not sure what a Biden administration really means.
BULL10|Palantir is not a revenue giant compared to some of its peers, but the company's finances suggest profit is not far away, and there appears to be a growth narrative in place for Palantir stock.
BULL11|Still, the stock is not overvalued by any traditional metric.
NEUT12|With all that said, I believe the time is right for risk tolerant buyers to jump in on Palantir stock.
NEUT13|When has the government stop spending?
BEAR14|There is some concern that Palantir will struggle in a Biden administration while only being a publicly traded company.
NEUT15|Since October, Palantir has been doing business with the US government for 18 years, spanning multiple administrations.
NEUT16|I think it's safe to say the era of big government is not over a new administrations are about rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.
BEAR17|Neither party is sincerely interested in cutting spending.
NEUT18|Yes, plenty and may have to find other segments of the US government to draw from, but a $44 million dollar contract from the Food and Drug Administration FDA suggests it's already starting to make that pivot.
NEUT19|What are customers saying?
NEUT20|The customers that, like the company's products really like him and customers that have concerns don't hate the product.
NEUT21|It sounds like many of the customers don't object to the quality of the product, but on more esoteric things such as ease of installation or perhaps the product being too robust for what they need.
NEUT22|The only thing that really matters is whether or not the company can continue to generate revenue.
NEUT23|My guess is they will.
