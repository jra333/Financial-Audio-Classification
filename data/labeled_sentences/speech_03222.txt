NEUT0|"""Dear reader you probably know that I don't make stock recommendations."
NEUT1|However, I have two thoughts regarding your personal expenditures that can save you real money.
NEUT2|I'm suggesting that you call on the services of two subsidiaries of Berkshire, GEICO and Borsheim's.
NEUT3|I estimate that about 40% of all auto drivers in the country can save money by insuring with GEICO.
NEUT4|The figure is not 100% because insurers differ in their underwriting judgments, with some favoring drivers who live in certain geographical areas and work in certain occupations more than GEICO does.
NEUT5|I believe, however, that GEICO more frequently offers the low price than does any other national carrier selling insurance to all comers.
NEUT6|You can quickly find out whether you can save money by going to www.geico.com or by calling 800-555-2756.
NEUT7|Find jewelry.
NEUT8|Watch is an giftware will almost certainly cost you less at borsheim's.
NEUT9|I've looked at the figures for all publicly owned jewelry companies.
NEUT10|In the contrast with Borsheim's is startling.
BULL11|Our one store operation with its huge volume, enables us to operate with costs that are fully 15 to 20 percentage points below those in curd by our competitors.
NEUT12|We pass the benefits of this low cost structure along to our customers.
NEUT13|Every year Borsheim sends out thousands of selections to customers who want a long distance opportunity to inspect what it offers and decide which, if any item they'd like to purchase.
NEUT14|We do a huge amount of business in this low key way which allows the shopper to conveniently see the exceptional values that we offer.
NEUT15|Call Sean more or Karen Gorak at Borsheim's 800-642-4438 and save substantial money on your next purchase of jewelry.
NEUT16|Sincerely.
NEUT17|Warren E.
NEUT18|"Buffett."""
