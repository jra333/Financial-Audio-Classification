BULL0|"""I still think Union Pacific is a great company."
NEUT1|I'm not changing my view, but I do think the stocks now in need of a catalyst.
NEUT2|Even if the Bears are wrong about the precision railroading story running out of steam right now, well, it's still got a limited shelf life, so here's an idea.
NEUT3|I've been thinking how about if you need Pacific buys KSU alright, which target reported the best quarter loop you in Pacific, can absolutely afford it.
BULL4|And in the last few weeks we've heard the case you might be indicating takeout offers from private equity firms.
NEUT5|Oh, come on, you Pacific better cashews roots are adjacent to theirs.
NEUT6|They have the United States, the United States, West of Mississippi.
NEUT7|Coupled with some really great roots in Mexico, more importantly, Kansas City was among the last of the rails to adopt precision railroading, meaning that story is much less played out for them.
BULL8|There's lots of room for efficiency, and I bet the price could be arrived at that's not too diluted beyond the first year.
NEUT9|Could this deal pass muster at any trust?
NEUT10|I think so.
NEUT11|We've got five major railroads right now.
NEUT12|The for publicly traded once in Burlington, Northern subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway, you Pacific Snap, Kansas City Southern would be a five to four go, and those tend to be doable there.
NEUT13|Any trust Department tends not to be frowning on those.
NEUT14|Supposedly they didn't want to sell in 20 billion.
NEUT15|So I think you Pacific would have to pay 21 billion or $25 a share for starts.
BEAR16|Getting too expensive hurting their stock.
NEUT17|Honestly, they could maybe go up to 24 billion.
BULL18|That's stretching a bit.
BEAR19|The bottom line numbers of is getting hammered here in the wake of a not so hot quarter.
NEUT20|Not to mention a huge spike in covid cases as the precision railroading story winds down, they need to give you a new catalyst rather than continue to buyback huge slugs.
NEUT21|With stock like CSX, I think he was officially just reach out and acquire Kansas City Southern.
NEUT22|That would make me want to buy this one hand over fist.
BEAR23|It keeps coming out and I'll even waive my investment banking fee.
