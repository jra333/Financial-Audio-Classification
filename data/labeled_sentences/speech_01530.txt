NEUT0|"""Welcome back to the channel rack."
NEUT1|Here I'm here.
NEUT2|So if you are one of my returning subscribers, then you know that I'm extremely bullish on Amazon.
NEUT3|However, if you are new to the channel you're in for a treat.
NEUT4|So over a month ago, I made a video how I think that Amazon is no longer an E Commerce business, but rather it is a data company.
NEUT5|When you think of Amazon, what do you think?
NEUT6|Do you think of it as an ecommerce business?
NEUT7|Maybe a logistics company?
NEUT8|Do you think of it as a company with a bunch of robots delivering you stuff from the Internet?
NEUT9|So what exactly is Amazon?
NEUT10|And what if I told you that I don't think it's any of these things?
NEUT11|I think that it's a data company.
NEUT12|Would you believe me?
NEUT13|And in that video I probably the stock with some pretty large price targets.
NEUT14|Under all scenarios, Amazon is a buy an today.
NEUT15|I still believe in those price targets.
BULL16|In fact, I even up my price targets.
NEUT17|That's how bullish I am on the company.
NEUT18|So today I'm going to be valuing Amazon stock again.
NEUT19|I'm going to be re running my discounted cash flow model so the video today is going to get right to the point it's going to be shorter than my last video.
NEUT20|If you want to watch that that's linked above.
NEUT21|The main point of this video is going to be my updated price target.
NEUT22|Oh, and by the way, the majority of you are not subscribed.
NEUT23|Be sure to subscribe.
NEUT24|It's free to do so, so Amazon stock has been flat for about six months now, but the stock is ready to take off, and today Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Fed, announced that interest rates are not going to be increased until 2023.
NEUT25|This is a huge deal, and before Amazon takes off, I have been accumulating shares of Amazon because I think Amazon is undervalued and there are multiple reasons why I think Amazon is undervalued.
NEUT26|But the main reason?
BULL27|Is because Amazon is growing at such a rapid pace.
NEUT28|I mean, just take a look at the revenue growth over the past few years.
NEUT29|Also, my model has value the stock ranging anywhere from $3600 per share to $5400 per share.
NEUT30|And quite frankly I'm leaning towards the higher end and so my price target for Amazon is $4600 per share.
NEUT31|Full disclosure, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT32|Anything I say is my opinion and it is for entertainment purposes only.
NEUT33|But if you enjoyed this video today, make sure to smash that like Button, turn on those notifications.
NEUT34|As well as that belt so that you can be the first to know.
BEAR35|"Whenever I find stocks undervalued for you."""
