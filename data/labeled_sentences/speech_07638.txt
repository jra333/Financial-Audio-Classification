NEUT1|Today it's August 15th, 2020 it's about 10:00 AM Central here in the US.
BULL2|God bless you and yours.
NEUT3|No matter where you are in the world.
NEUT4|Folks please subscribe.
NEUT5|Give us a thumbs up and ring that buffer critical future updates.
BEAR6|Well folks, it appears that Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway have made a huge bet against the United States economy.
NEUT7|Yes, you heard me correctly.
NEUT8|Berkshire Hathaway has just found their 13 F for the second quarter of 2020, and it gives us some very interesting information.
NEUT9|It appears that Berkshire Hathaway is selling off all of their shares of banking corporations here in the US.
BEAR10|Big banks included now Berkshire Hathaway could have sold off more shares since the end of June, since it's now August.
NEUT11|But this report covers their transactions through June and what it shows is they sold 100% of their interest in Goldman Sachs.
NEUT12|They sold 62% of their interest in JP Morgan.
NEUT13|Berkshire Hathaway also sold off 26% of their stake in Wells Fargo folks.
NEUT14|I guess they are betting against all the foreclosures and the commercial loans that will be defaulted in the next quarter or two.
BEAR15|Berkshire also trimmed its bet on PNC Financial, M&T Bank.
NEUT16|And Bank of New York Mellon Corp. MasterCard and visa.
NEUT17|So they're betting on defaults on credit cards and these other institutions or basically mortgage institutions.
NEUT18|Let that be a warning to everyone.
BULL19|Now they've increased their Holdings to 21 million shares in Barrick Gold Corporation during this time period, and this could be much more increased by now.
NEUT20|We're actually 75 days into the third quarter of 2020, so I assume that this trend has continued with Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT21|I suggest that you take this as a warning and heed these financial moves by this investor, Warren Buffett.
NEUT22|He is buying gold and gold corporations.
NEUT23|Ann is also selling off U.S. banks, making a bet against the US economy.
NEUT24|"In the future, God bless you and yours folks, please share this information and please subscribe."""
