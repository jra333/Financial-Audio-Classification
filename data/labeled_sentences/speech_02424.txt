NEUT0|"""Hello buddy and thanks for watching this video game quick update on Walt Disney Company, the Disney films, Disney and the Good News is that this market."
NEUT1|Reasons why is he keeps going up, they just have launched in just a couple of months ago with the launch of apps one month ago.
NEUT2|The Disney plus.
NEUT3|So this channel and just to you know, cope with the coronavirus so they were really fast to adapt to change their business to to adapt to accommodate the the users.
NEUT4|So hours Tobias request this.
BULL5|They were very good into it and I think that's why they've been rewarded.
NEUT6|So this is an update on the condition but.
NEUT7|I don't think that.
NEUT8|Hopefully be some fundamental Alice.
BEAR9|I don't think that he will keep going up for awhile.
NEUT10|Perhaps I would see another you know proposed in the market.
NEUT11|So another sideways, strained right like the like.
NEUT12|It's all those post.
NEUT13|This is a passes in the market so the markets won't collapse.
NEUT14|Going up is a bullish bullish market.
NEUT15|But again with some stops in the in the in this app.
NEUT16|Ward Bradley so so first of all based on technical analysis.
NEUT17|It seems that this line, this one can work, is work that support.
NEUT18|So this one's two bands bounce up so we can start by target prices.
NEUT19|Is 1/1/10.
BEAR20|$110 we can assume for now, but originally fees and uptrending goes up.
NEUT21|It's gonna form a new pico.
NEUT22|Perhaps this one I can work as a service instance.
NEUT23|Let's see what is what's gonna happen.
BULL24|And again, this nice good good is very good for long term investment becauses gonna go up again as it was before.
NEUT25|I'm sure it's not now, but it's it's.
NEUT26|It's very long.
NEUT27|Longer term investment has to go up because now it's all shot is all shut down all the studio.
NEUT28|So all the businesses that they.
NEUT29|They're all closed, so they're getting money only from some, perhaps Disney plus and other businesses that are might not be aware of so.
NEUT30|But yeah, that's it as as as we're standing now is just go along for short term analysis, so even for long term actually, but.
BEAR31|But you know, there is always the risk of that the market can fall down.
NEUT32|Do it to the next Wednesday.
NEUT33|There's a Wednesday morning, there will be a thing not.
NEUT34|There's no any any.
NEUT35|Anyways this morning report.
NEUT36|But there will be there.
BEAR37|They're seeing that there are some loss loss.
NEUT38|In in the in the business, as we were expected.
NEUT39|So perhaps this news you can can let the stock drop down.
NEUT40|So let's see how it goes in the next days.
NEUT41|But again as summary overall just we can buy Sims then we can buy all wait more signal just ever look to the stochastic analysis I but we just this is what I found.
NEUT42|Just be based on technical analysis entering the lines hopefully.
BULL43|Yet the market will go up for awhile, but again we need to be always, always alert and aware because we are in a crisis crisis situation, so the market can anytime go down there.
BULL44|So that's also even we should invest in the direction of the time, so it's good.
NEUT45|So we should go up then it's fine, but again, always be aware.
BEAR46|And earlier today we are we are living in a crisis time and anything can happen, so it's not really the best time to invest even when the signal to me it's more than clear should go up.
NEUT47|But you know, again, we are not, so we don't need to be so confident, especially now.
BULL48|"That's all, thanks man."""
