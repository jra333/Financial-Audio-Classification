NEUT0|"""Yo, what is good opportunity investors today I'm going to be talking about why I am bearish on Netflix stock."
NEUT1|It really comes down to three reasons.
NEUT2|The first reason is that Netflix has a lot of competitors coming into their space.
NEUT3|First of all they have Disney which is coming out with the streaming service and Disney is going to be able to release a bunch of their old Disney movies.
NEUT4|They're taking away the rights that Netflix has to those movies, and they're taking them and they'll be able to supply those.
NEUT5|Movies Those TV shows all to their.
NEUT6|Subscribers to their platform.
NEUT7|So Netflix is losing all of that while Disney is there to gain.
BEAR8|Also, Disney is undercutting Netflix in its pricing.
NEUT9|It's going to be priced about, I believe 6 to $8.00, while Netflix is all the way up at 12.
NEUT10|So that is a huge difference right there.
NEUT11|The next reason why I'm bearish on Netflix is because.
NEUT12|Netflix also has another competitor coming that was just released today.
NEUT13|AMC said that they're coming out with their own streaming platform where movies that they have in their theaters can be bought by people who have subscribed to the AMC subscription.
NEUT14|So they can buy.
BEAR15|Movies and that's also going to take away from Netflix's potential.
BEAR16|Another reason why I'm bearish and this is the third final reason why I'm bearish on Netflix stock is because their last quarter was not very good.
NEUT17|So if Netflix isn't going to perform with their earnings that comes out tomorrow.
BEAR18|Netflix is going to tank.
NEUT19|There's no question about it.
NEUT20|That's why I feel like it's never been a better option to short Netflix stock.
BEAR21|Then it is today right now because if Netflix does not perform this quarter, not only do they have the competitors of AMC and Disney, and even Apple TV is coming as well, that's another competitor.
NEUT22|So all of these competitors are coming into their space.
NEUT23|Their PE ratio is through the roof.
NEUT24|It's really overvalued.
NEUT25|And if they don't perform during this earnings.
BEAR26|It's going to be terrible for Netflix stock, so really it is not a good time to be a Netflix investor now.
BULL27|There is potential for Netflix to continue on.
BULL28|It is a great brand and it does have a good streaming platform.
BEAR29|However, it the upside potential of being bearish on Netflix stock right now is just too huge to ignore.
NEUT30|So for that reason, I.
BULL31|"In very bearish on Netflix stock that is all I have to say today, folks have a good day."""
