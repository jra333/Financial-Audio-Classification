NEUT0|"""Should the police be able to seize your personal property and keep it even if you didn't commit a crime?"
NEUT1|The shocking answer is that they can do that.
NEUT2|Take your property and not return it.
NEUT3|Even if he didn't commit a crime.
NEUT4|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT5|This is what's ahead.
NEUT6|We give you insights.
NEUT7|You need to navigate this turbulent world.
NEUT8|The procedure is called civil asset forfeiture.
NEUT9|The procedure was put in several decades ago on the federal and state level to seize assets of criminals.
NEUT10|Who got their gains illicitly?
NEUT11|So if you use the car to Rob a bank, the authorities would seize the car.
BEAR12|That's fine, but unfortunately that process been grossly abused to shake down innocent citizens.
NEUT13|Give you one example.
BEAR14|A woman, Rebecca Brown, was taking cash on a flight to her father, a retired engineer.
NEUT15|Now the father didn't Trust Bank, so he kept the cash in his basement.
NEUT16|Cash was perfectly legal, but the airport the TSA took it out the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration came along, sees the cash.
NEUT17|Even though months later, they never charged with anything, never proved the cash was gained, illicitly, they kept it.
NEUT18|That's not right.
NEUT19|And who does it hurt the most?
BEAR20|No surprise this practice hurts the most.
BEAR21|Those with the least, especially members of minority communities who don't have the resources and voice to fight this injustice.
BEAR22|The Institute for Justice, a nonprofit organization that defends individuals against bad government behavior, has filed a major class action suit on behalf of Rebecca Brown.
BEAR23|And thousands of others whose property has been, I think, illegally seized by authorities, even though those individuals didn't commit a crime.
NEUT24|But Congress should not wait for this lawsuit to go through the courts.
NEUT25|Congress should not wait for states to make reforms like North Carolina, which banned this practice altogether.
NEUT26|Congress should follow the example of North Carolina and make sure this is banned forever.
NEUT27|It's one thing to have criminal asset seizure.
NEUT28|Everyone understands that, but no property should be seized from any American.
NEUT29|Without due process of law this is a must in a police reform bill.
NEUT30|I'm Steve Forbes.

NEUT32|Please send in your comments and suggestions.
