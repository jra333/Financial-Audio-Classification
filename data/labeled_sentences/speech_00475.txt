NEUT0|"""Let's just talk a little bit about to where gold is and why it's at these levels."
NEUT1|I guess we don't.
NEUT2|We have uncertainty in the US, but the debt ceiling and we got of course the Greek and, well, the Southern European peripheral country crisis too.
NEUT3|Go to some subject that we like and we recently published a very detailed production report Gold Market an because I think in the market a lot of people know the demand side of the story already we have the uncertainties globally and we have the period 3 becoming increasing scenario an all sort of uncertainty so that site is pretty well known.
NEUT4|But what we have done recently as we look at the supply side of the story and we count all the goldmine Major Gomez under construction NC.
NEUT5|What's the fraction growth for the next couple of years?
NEUT6|I think that's the thing, isn't it?
NEUT7|Jen, Jen?
NEUT8|I mean, you've studied in like 375 miners and mining companies here, but over the last few years we just really haven't seen much.
NEUT9|Come on in terms of supply mean, how much is supply been growing and how does it way up next to the demand side to hear?
BULL10|Yes if we account order 375 gold mines and the coal companies such that under pretty good job then in the base case we think deeper doesn't growth is going to be only a 3.6% per annum for the next couple of years and also demand projected to be.
NEUT11|An demand we we did a pretty simplistic view on that.
BEAR12|Even if we keep the whole demand on a flat line basis, we think the gold market is still going to be in a deficit for the next couple of years.
NEUT13|Just given that the central banks are now back Feingold massively and that's the other thing, because for the gold market we talk about, say, under production growth, an underground production, this is the mining, production growth and they're not there for the above ground supply and the central banks are now.
NEUT14|Turning from net by net seller of gold into a net buyer of gold, and that's a massive spring.
NEUT15|Yeah, that's certainly the case.
NEUT16|And we saw how many of the central banks in Europe sold off go.
NEUT17|But let's just talk a little bit about.
BEAR18|Well the other side, the unwillingness perhaps to put more supply onto the market by these mining groups because they, like the status quo as it is.
NEUT19|Part of the issue, the other part of the issue is you know production growth study.
NEUT20|We also look at the IR of the coal projects right now and it just turned out that the gold price has to be very high to justify building a gold mine.
NEUT21|To give you an idea for Brownfield project, you need to talk about the price to be long term goal, price to be higher $1400.
NEUT22|That's a big barrier to entry is what you're saying here exactly?
NEUT23|And so we're talking about and do you see?
NEUT24|I mean, let's look at your price targets here as well.
NEUT25|OK, let's have a look at the end of 2011.
NEUT26|Where will go will be and where will go be in five years, for instance too.
NEUT27|Alright, we have a separate commodity team to set the gold price assumptions here and then.
NEUT28|Basically, in our base case, we're looking to go price to reach about $2000 by.
NEUT29|OK, so that means it makes these Greenfield sites viable at that point, then by 4:14, and then if in the bull case scenario, and if we just look at the one.
NEUT30|Sector model driven by GDP per capital in China and India.
NEUT31|Then there is a chance that the gold price can be as high as a $5000 pounds.
NEUT32|Yeah 5000 yeah bye but that's why 1220?
NEUT33|Alright OK that's quite cool there.
NEUT34|So we think of you know about huge amount of growth in the price but OK let's see who's going to be buying the most gold.
NEUT35|Is it traditionally Indians who have the wedding season coming on?
NEUT36|I think in a couple of months from now or is it going to be the Chinese?
NEUT37|I will say both.
NEUT38|If you look at.
NEUT39|The gold price correlation to a number of factors.
BULL40|"In fact at the professor has the highest correlation to GDP per capita disposable income in China and India in the past 30 years, basically."""
