BULL0|"""Hello friends, on my channel and thanks for watching this video."
BULL1|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about the long term chart of Inspire MD Inc. And if you look at this talk So what what you can see here that the stock has been making a base in the past couple of months and it has started moving up.
NEUT2|OK so.
NEUT3|Well, what we need to do here is we need to mark down the important levels which we can probably call as our support.
NEUT4|Now why it is important?
BULL5|So the stock is moving up.
NEUT6|There is no doubt about it.
BULL7|And if you want to calculate the rise in terms of percentage so it has actually moved up by 150%, so it's a good rise, I would say now.
NEUT8|Any uncertainity may come and the stock could probably correct from this level and this is a possibility and that's why what we need to do here is we need to mark our support levels and you as you can see here you have your primary or.
BULL9|Important support level.
NEUT10|At .75, so this is the.
NEUT11|I would say the first support level which you need to take care of and your final or the last support level, which you can also call as you stop losses .5.
BEAR12|So if the stock falls below .5, there is no need to carry any trend further on the downside.
BULL13|But to keep moving up the to keep moving upside for this stock, the stock must sustain above .75.
NEUT14|OK, so this is also condition.
NEUT15|No, what we're going to expect here.
NEUT16|Heard something like this?
NEUT17|So because we're looking at a long term chart, so the levels we're going to expect here.
NEUT18|Will we also?
NEUT19|For a long term and one more thing that it may take several weeks, several months if something happens in a very quick manner, that's a different thing.
NEUT20|And that's we don't even consider OK, what we consider here is the trend and the length of the trend.
NEUT21|And we're not time driven that it will happen in one week or two week.
NEUT22|That's not what we're thinking here, because when we're talking about long term, obviously we're talking about weeks and months.
NEUT23|So for the time being, the levels.
NEUT24|That we are expecting over here will start from a dollar.
NEUT25|Then you have 1.6.
NEUT26|If this.
NEUT27|2 levels get crossed, then we have two more levels.
NEUT28|Which is 3.13 and 4.98 or $5 simultaneously.
NEUT29|So as you can see here, there are steps.
NEUT30|So on the downside, the stock must not fall below .5 for the time being or to move further on the upside, the stock must sustain our .75 if it sustains then we have two primary targets to look at.
NEUT31|That is one an 1.63 dollars if it get crossed then we have two more levels to add on which is.
NEUT32|Or which will extend in between?
BULL33|Or through 3.13 and can go up to 4.98 or $5 on the upside.
NEUT34|So this is the end of the video.
