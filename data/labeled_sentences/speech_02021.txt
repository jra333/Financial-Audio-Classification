NEUT0|"""Time now for John Clark and Brian Door."
BULL1|Thanks for your time tonight.
BULL2|It's very good to be with you.
BULL3|My pleasure.
NEUT4|Good evening.
NEUT5|I understand you're an economist.
NEUT6|I am an economist.
NEUT7|Yes indeed.
NEUT8|Do you understand the euro now?
NEUT9|I'm an economist.
NEUT10|Now you want religious questions, Brian, you gotta go and get somebody appropriately qualified.
NEUT11|I'm an economist.
NEUT12|Can you explain to us then the Greek economy?
NEUT13|Brian, are you know, better value elsewhere.
NEUT14|I think.
NEUT15|I mean, I wouldn't bet it really well.
NEUT16|So what do you mean, no, I wouldn't touch it with the Paul Brown.
NEUT17|Don't put your money in there.
NEUT18|No no, no, I don't want to invest in it.
NEUT19|I'm just asking you to discuss seeking information.
NEUT20|Information about oh, I see 'cause there's a great amount of nervousness, isn't there?
NEUT21|Certainly is broken.
NEUT22|They have.
BEAR23|Let's face it, very serious structural problems with the Greek economy.
BEAR24|They're broke.
NEUT25|They would be of things improved out of sight.
BEAR26|Brian, I think the problem is actually worse than that at the moment, and they've received a bailout from the other European economies.
NEUT27|Yes, mainly France and Germany.
NEUT28|Yes, why France and Germany exactly where they work for their successful economy is strong is the first bailout, didn't touch the sides, did it really?
BEAR29|Well they do have some serious structural problems and that needs to be addressed.
NEUT30|And what are they?
BEAR31|Well, they can't pay their debts, Brian.
NEUT32|I mean Greece owes 160% of what it produces.
NEUT33|I mean, the task is a sisyphean task.
NEUT34|It's rolling a rock up a mountain, so Greek is insolvent.
NEUT35|Brian put it this way.
NEUT36|If it were a private company, there'd be a fire there on Saturday, about 4:00 o'clock in the morning, right?
NEUT37|So how big was the bailout?
NEUT38|First bailout was $100 billion.
NEUT39|Second bailout, $100 billion.
NEUT40|Again run.
NEUT41|And how long will that last?
NEUT42|And I think there's some confidence that will get them to Tuesday, Wednesday.
NEUT43|So what is the alternative to bailing them out?
BEAR44|Well, not bailing them out would probably force them out the bottom of the EU.
NEUT45|And of course the strength of the EU is precisely the unity provided the capacity those countries have to help one another.
NEUT46|But don't they weaken themselves by doing that they do?
BEAR47|That's a very good point in the novelty of giving Greece $100 billion every fortnight is going to wear off.
NEUT48|It's on the Greeks.
NEUT49|Don't want to stir it measures obviously they don't know.
NEUT50|And of course they would need to be complicit in a solution they need to make it work, but why would anyone want to invest in an economy that campaigns down?
NEUT51|Good question, but people have been doing it for 20 years.
NEUT52|That's why the problem exists, right?
NEUT53|And whatever else they sort out that might have to apply to sell through other European economy.
NEUT54|That's right.
BEAR55|Sorry bro.
NEUT56|The setting is just getting a text, sorry, what's that?
NEUT57|Would we like to buy Portugal by Portugal?
NEUT58|Anybody wanna buy Portugal?
NEUT59|Yeah Portugal's, for sale.
NEUT60|How much are they won't need money, we just need to guarantee the debt.
NEUT61|Oh hello living a special red spot special if we do it today we can have island as well.
NEUT62|So really how much for both?
NEUT63|How much have you got?
NEUT64|Does anyone got a hat?
NEUT65|We might have a crack at this.
BULL66|Islands nice, that is good enough.
NEUT67|"Yeah summer."""
