BEAR0|"""In a way, it is a bit unfortunate that this there is no alternative to stocks because a lot of investors who otherwise wouldn't want to take on that risk appetite would remain in the bond market."
NEUT1|But with pressure on rates and rates at a very low level, we're left with investing in stocks in terms of where to allocate.
NEUT2|We think the growth versus value discussion.
BEAR3|Has run its course and in fact been a little off base in that they're lumping all tech companies as these growth stocks that cannot do well in a rising rate environment.
NEUT4|We don't think that's true, especially with rates at these relatively low levels.
BULL5|A lot of tech companies are flush with cash, their strong cash flows.
NEUT6|They're in very traditional businesses.
NEUT7|By 2021 terms.
NEUT8|We don't think they should get lumped into with emerging technology companies that don't have.
NEUT9|Visibility for earnings, and that's where we're focusing right now.
BULL10|In fact, with the recent flat lining of the triple cues or the widening of the gap between big tech and traditional value place, we think there are some values in large cap growth.
NEUT11|Large cap tech names alright mark.
NEUT12|Well, you know you're back and clean up here.
NEUT13|Would exchange.
NEUT14|We're going to ask you for some stock names can give us some stocks that kind of fit that profile in your mind.
BULL15|Well, we've seen recent positive move moves in Microsoft and Oracle.
BULL16|An alphabets out an all time high.
BULL17|Facebook's been on a great run look alphabet and Facebook or advertising companies to a large extent.
NEUT18|And with the reopening.
NEUT19|This is where the travel ads that disappeared for from Google last year.
BULL20|They're all going to come back and they're coming back strong.
BULL21|Facebook, despite its regulatory problems, it seems to know how and where to connect with small businesses that are bursting to reconnect.
NEUT22|With their customers, so those are two names we like.
BEAR23|We also think that Apple is well positioned with younger generation for generations to come and to look at interim drops in Apple stock price is a mistake because ecosystems and lifestyles are becoming intertwined more each day as younger people adopt Apple's technology.
NEUT24|Yeah, a lot of people on their iPhones when you go pretty much anywhere.
NEUT25|Mark, I know a lot of people are watching the yield on the 10 year.
BEAR26|It's down slightly today, still above 1.7.
NEUT27|But you're actually watching the yield curve kind of explain that.
NEUT28|And what are you seeing there that you think is a signal to investors and maybe even the Fed?
NEUT29|Well, what the yield curve is doing right now.
BULL30|It's not only raising up rates, it's also widening the gap between longer dated and shorter dated maturities, and that helps bank profits.
BEAR31|That's an immediate hit to their operating profit margins, and This is why we like financials.
BULL32|This is going to be almost free money for banks doing the exact same thing they've been doing, but now their profit margin grows up.
NEUT33|That's a great business to be in.
BULL34|We also think that the improvement in credit quality.
BULL35|Gives bank earnings more visibility and in an overbanked world that is going to lead to more bank mergers, people are going to need to link up.
BULL36|They want to reduce the costs of overhead.
NEUT37|The costs of branches, they call them stores.
NEUT38|They want to redo it, reduce the cost of technology and by doing that they're going to marry up and merge.
BULL39|And that's going to bring an equity premium to the market.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
