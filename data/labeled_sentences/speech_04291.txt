BULL0|"""Hi guys, welcome to sleep in Markets video update for me."
NEUT1|John Kibler head currency analyst.
BULL2|In this video we're going to go through gold.
NEUT3|Just give a little update of what we talked about last week and we talked about this potential downside for Golden.
NEUT4|If I bring back in that seasonality heat map we can see that actually gold through November.
NEUT5|Typically for server, just grab that in here we can see that it's minus nought .5% just on here.
BEAR6|So that's just something that we could start seeing a little bit of downside to the gold market.
BULL7|We talked about this last week that we could see some downside as well and we were watching this level in particular for a reaction in the market rallied back into that level.
BEAR8|Gave us three rejections and then it broke through, but now prices trading back below that area.
BULL9|We haven't taken out these highs through here, which is still a good sign and we have this trend line running through here as a potential area to watch for the breakout.
NEUT10|So what we can do here is just set this trend line up if price breaks and closes below all these lows through here.
NEUT11|OK, this is a good little zone as well.
NEUT12|Just through here roundabout that 1890 area.
NEUT13|If price can break through this level.
NEUT14|True, that trendline close below look for the pullback.
NEUT15|Look for the continuation to the downside.
BEAR16|Still looking for the market to target this 1850 level if it breaks beyond that, then we could see some further downside to this market as well.
BULL17|Going to that weekly time frame looks good to see a nice pull back down into this level because then we looked at that seasonality report as well.
BEAR18|In the previous video and the fact that price usually drops this time of year into sort of the end of November star December, then we see a rally.
BULL19|In the price of gold so still looking for this pullback to happen then looking for the potential for the market to rally to the upside through December and January.
NEUT20|So keep it on gold.
BULL21|Still still looking good alot.
NEUT22|The idea of a break of this trendline enclosed below.
NEUT23|If we get that we can look for that short move.
BULL24|"Thanks for watching speak to you soon."""
