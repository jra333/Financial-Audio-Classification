NEUT0|"""Because they're going to report after the Bell we had on Colin Rush from Oppenheimer, he's the senior analyst over there regarding Tesla talking just in the last 30 minutes about what to expect, pay no attention is not necessarily to the 500,000 deliveries that some people are counting on for full year."
NEUT1|But Julie you also asked about the cost of this stock right now, which is trading higher.
BULL2|It's up about 1.5%.
BULL3|Yes, it's raining hard today and it's up more than 400% this year.
NEUT4|And as we know, you can't even look at the price to earnings ratio of this thing.
NEUT5|And Colin talked about sort of trying to evaluate based on future presumed earnings growth, which is kind of up in the air in terms of of where it could be.
NEUT6|In terms of this quarter specifically, the earnings per share estimate is around $0.55 a share.
NEUT7|Revenue estimate around 8:00 and a quarter billion dollars.
NEUT8|So we'll be watching for those numbers an any update on that production number, because, as you noted, Colin said you know 500,000 them hitting that target is less important.
NEUT9|And then showing progress on the trajectory as we know, a lot of these goals for Tesla have been sort of moving targets and by and large if you look at how the stocks down this year, investors haven't seemed to mine.
NEUT10|Then you want to say some real quick.
NEUT11|Well, just that Julie.
NEUT12|So right, the way this company's earnings always work is as long as they can have one positive headlines, a highlight.
BULL13|The stock will be just fine.
NEUT14|You know the company and Elon Musk make a lot of promises and you know, it's flag wavers.
NEUT15|Just like to see that they are actually on the road toward delivering on those promises so you know the 500,000 cars this year number.
NEUT16|Well, even if they miss that, if it looks like we're going to get really close, fine, because they already shared the number, I think 138 thousand or something for the last three months.
BULL17|And people are happy about that, or consequently up.
BULL18|We're not gonna get anywhere near 500,000, but we'll have another profitable quarter.
NEUT19|How about that people say, oh, hurray, profit.
NEUT20|So you know how these things usually go with Tesla earnings.
