BULL0|"""CJ here AKA the greatest furue just wanted to congratulate those who are in Netflix after hours has jumped to over 560, so it's looking good for tomorrow."
BEAR1|As a matter of fact, there was a buy signal this afternoon where people could have jumped in and gambled on the earnings and those who did made out like a bandit.
BULL2|Which is great, even though.
NEUT3|Surprise me, jump up at the gap around 565 seventy.
BULL4|It is still within a goodbye point.
NEUT5|As a matter of fact, if it crosses over 572, that would be a good spot to get in.
BULL6|It'll be hitting all time highs as well as probably reaching higher with blue skies ahead of them with subsequent upgrades that all these people are going to these institutions anywhere are going to jump in.
BULL7|To try to upgrade Netflix, it will just continue going up higher.
BULL8|I foresee it, possibly even going as high as 700.
BULL9|"So happy trading and good luck."""
