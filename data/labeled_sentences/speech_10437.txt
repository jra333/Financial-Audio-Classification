BEAR0|"""For weeks now I've been recommending the bull markets have been created by an out of control pandemic without any stimulus."
NEUT1|Dan today, though I said you should wait for a pullback before you buy the covid stocks till people realize that covid out of control.
NEUT2|We have those stimulus.
NEUT3|Well now it's happening.
NEUT4|So rather than panicking which never made anybody time, we're sticking to our guns and coming out here tonight and telling you to put the buying plan into action that's been waiting for.
NEUT5|Remember the covid bull markets there.
NEUT6|Bunch of them first, there's the bull market in 5G.
NEUT7|Anyone who spent the weekend trying to adjust their fantasy lineup.
BEAR8|Or watch Borat was sorely tested by slow Internet speeds, ends with five G2.
NEUT9|There's the bull market digitization broad term, but think anything that helps companies accelerate the move from on premise, which in many cases is locked down to the cloud.
NEUT10|Three, we've got a bull market in hygiene.
NEUT11|We have many ways to fight this virus, but cleanliness pathetically is one of them.
NEUT12|But I'll take it, for we got a bull market in home renovation.
NEUT13|Both do it yourself and professional.
NEUT14|These are the stocks that companies that make the stay at home work at home economy more bearable.
NEUT15|The extension of a housing boom.
NEUT16|This caused by a major axis from the cities of the suburbs and even further out remember the renovation trade is all about tools and paint, not home builders.
BEAR17|5 There's a bull market in all sorts of things involving cars thanks to the pandemic mass transit.
NEUT18|Even ride sharing your views.
NEUT19|Unsafe, easier to just get a car, especially if you've moved to the suburbs.
NEUT20|Now there are three big fears.
NEUT21|Weigh on us.
BEAR22|Getting sick, shutting the economy down, and the possibility of an election that doesn't get decided overnight after 2016.
NEUT23|You know what?
NEUT24|I don't even want to hazard a guess.
NEUT25|About who's going to win the White House or the Senate this time around, I can't say that if the outcomes indecisive and it takes a week to find out in one while the market is going to go down be another opportunity to go through these bull markets.
NEUT26|But the other two fears listen every single bull market I just listed will work even if covid keeps spiking and we have to go back into lockdown.
NEUT27|And I don't want to lock down.
