BULL0|"""Welcome back everyone."
BEAR1|Is Friday March 27th and Christina Bertha, new investment analyst cared exam.com and they will be looking at what's happening in the WTI oil futures market, so looking closely at the four hour chart, we can see that WTI has been trading sideways since it touched an 18 year low of 20.50 last week creating at the same time a descending triangle at the bottom of a downtrend.
BEAR2|I know this is a bad news for the market because a descending triangle is usually a continuation pattern, which means that.
NEUT3|Is down trend is likely to continue in the coming sessions are once, of course the price breaks at the base of the triangle around 22 and more importantly closes below at 20.50 are looking at the momentum indicators at the asylum.
BEAR4|Agdi also seem to be shifting back South, suggesting that the next move in the price will be down as well.
NEUT5|So if you drop below her 20.50 the focus will shift back to 1990s as support levels first at 17.
NEUT6|We are the 13 number while lower the area between 10:00 and 11:00 could be a bit more challenging to overcome.
BEAR7|On the flip side now, since our surprises happening rebound above the triangle and a breakup of the nearby resistance of 25.12 could extend the upside correction towards the previous high at 28.45, which is where the upper surface of the HTML cloud and the 23.6% people Nachi of the download from.
NEUT8|54.62 to 20.50 are located above that zone.
NEUT9|Steeper rally could take place towards the 38.2% Fibonacci of 33.53 and before that 50% of ownership of 37.56 comes into view, so that's all from me.
NEUT10|Thank you for watching.
BULL11|"Have a great day."""
