NEUT0|"""Hi, this is Steve Knight and welcome to Blackwell Globals Daily market update."
BULL1|Starting with the euro on the pair initially rallied higher, but ended up hitting a targeted trendline around the one spot 1257 Mark, which saw plenty of selling and appears subsequently closed.
BULL2|The session only fractionally above the ones bought 12 handle.
BEAR3|In addition, the US jobless claims proved better than expected, coming in below estimates at 200 and 52,000, which added to the pressure the next 24 hours will be interesting for the Paris 100.
BEAR4|Ma is nearing at one spot 1198, and the euro may very well lean against that level sharply.
BULL5|Turning to the cable now and the pair managed to also close higher following some comments from the Bank of England's Forbes, who suggested that UK growth is improving and she sees no need for any further stimulus currently.
BEAR6|Subsequently, the pair rallied relatively strongly, but ran out of steam at the one spot 3091 high and subsequently retreated to its closing price at one spot 3062.
BEAR7|This level is likely to be either support in the coming session and we could very well see further challenges to the upside.
BULL8|Finally, turning to the Australian dollar and the pair initially rallied strongly, but has since pulled well back from the high to close up at spot 7637.
NEUT9|Much of the moves are technical in nature, but there is substantial $299 million option expiring around the spot.
NEUT10|7650 Mark due tomorrow.
BEAR11|Subsequently, there may be some impetus to keep the pair below this level in the lead up to the event.
NEUT12|Well, that's all I've got for you today.
NEUT13|This is Steve night with Blackwell Global.
BULL14|"Thanks for watching."""
