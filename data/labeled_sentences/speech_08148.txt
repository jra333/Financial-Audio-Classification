NEUT0|"""Hi Phyllis, welcome to another video from The Motley Fool Imoen Ben Alack, now Lloyds is spinning off TSB."
NEUT1|We've already seen it in the High Street TSB branches popping up everywhere.
NEUT2|Now it's going to take that bank and stick it on.
NEUT3|The stock market has to do this.
NEUT4|The European Commission has given it to the end of 2015 to spin off the bank so it's going to IPO.
NEUT5|It's going to float on the London Stock market.
NEUT6|I am going to buy shares in TSB.
NEUT7|I'm going to subscribe for shares in this IPO and I'm going to tell you why.
NEUT8|There are four reasons why I think this is actually quite a good deal.
NEUT9|Unlike most IPA's, which are generally pretty lousy deals, there's four reasons the first reason is that Lloyds looks like it's going to have to sell up this bank pretty cheap, at least initially.
NEUT10|It's going to sell 25% shares initially, and the range of prices currently is 220 pounds.
BEAR11|290 P now in the middle of that range at 255 P. That is less than the value that TSB is carry on the books of Lloyds, they're having to sell it as a bit of a discount even a few weeks ago.
BEAR12|They didn't think this was going to be the case, but things got a little bit rocky in the IPO market, so Lloyd's is going to have to sell it.
BULL13|A little bit cheaper looks like that's already quite a good reason to invest in IPO.
NEUT14|Secondly, this is a very very safe bank.
NEUT15|This bank has stacks and stacks of cash.
NEUT16|Once it's floated, the capsule core tier, one capital ratio will be about 17%.
BULL17|The average UK banks core tier, one capital ratio, is about 10 to 12%, so you can see there's a massive divergance there where the bank is much more loaded up the capital that makes it safer and also gives it lots of firepower to expand and grow, which is going to need to do to grow profits, but.
BULL18|It's got the firepower Stewart.
NEUT19|Thirdly, and I've already alluded to this noise is a forced seller.
NEUT20|Boys can't look and go on the markets a bit.
NEUT21|Software IPOs, let's put this off until next year.
NEUT22|Lads, it has to sell.
NEUT23|It has to take this back to the market.
NEUT24|That is completely the opposite of the general situation with IPOs, which is when people who own the company, maybe the founders or private equity or whatnot go up.
NEUT25|This is a good chance to sell it to a bunch of suckers at a profit that I'm perfectly Lloyds isn't doing this 'cause it thinks it's a good time to sell the bank is doing 'cause it has to sell the bank.
BULL26|Again, that implies price is likely to be cheaper than it should be.
NEUT27|A normal market conditions.
BEAR28|That's another bit of wind blowing in our favor.
NEUT29|Finally, you get free shares if you're a private investor and you subscribe up to £2000 for the IPO, you will get given one share for every 20 you hold for a year, so it's up to £2000.
NEUT30|You don't get if you're fat cat and you put in 50K, but for dubs 2K you get one share for every 20 that you have provided you holding for a year.
BULL31|That is equivalent to 5% uplift after year.
NEUT32|So you basically know that if you hold on to, the bank will get 5%.
NEUT33|So what do we got there?
NEUT34|We've got cheap.
NEUT35|We've got very safe.
NEUT36|We've got 4.
BULL37|"Sellers are likely a bargain, and we got three shares and that is a deal."""
