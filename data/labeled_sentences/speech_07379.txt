BULL0|"""Versus CEO Brandon York in the Fund was a big winner last year, seeing returns of more than 4000% in Q1 of 2020."
BULL1|Brandon, thanks for joining us and Congrats on that performance.
BULL2|Congrats, perhaps even more so on my right in saying 100% plus returns per annum on average 2008 to 2019.
BULL3|Thank you very much for having me, and while I can't speak about returns, I think that whether we're qualifying our performance in a month, like March, I think that what is most important, like you're highlighting, is how effective we are.
NEUT4|The rest of the time.
NEUT5|What are we doing to a portfolio beyond crashes?
NEUT6|And so tell us about that you are providing risk mitigation to people with otherwise traditional portfolios.
NEUT7|Correct, so we think about risk mitigation here at universa.
NEUT8|Much like most traditional asset allocators would.
NEUT9|How are we impacting a portfolio in a drawdown like a month like March, but when we evaluate our effectiveness as a strategy, we think about how we're impacting that portfolio.
NEUT10|The rest of the time, like from April until now.
NEUT11|Take away Brandon for especially for folks at home that are investing their own money.
NEUT12|Is there anything that they can do that you're not?
NEUT13|I know you have a very sophisticated tail risk mitigation strategy, but but are there any takeaways for other investors?
NEUT14|Sure, I mean we can't.
NEUT15|I wish we could give more advice to your general investor, but I think the main advice that we would have for them is 1.
NEUT16|To avoid derivatives trading themselves and think about your portfolio irrespective of your view on what's going to happen, you know we're in the midst of monetary stimulus.
NEUT17|You could see the market double.
NEUT18|Or you could see the market.
BEAR19|Crash again because of the valuations that were in that we've written about.
NEUT20|Think about your portfolio in that context and see it and be comfortable with either of those outcomes at the only other thing I would add is when you look at risk mitigation, whether you're evaluating long volatility, a tail risk, hedge fund like universa or bonds, or things like that in your portfolio, you need to make the same analysis.
BEAR21|Are you better off because of it as it helped you or made you worse off?
NEUT22|When you look at the risks out there, Brandon, do you think there has been too much stimulus and there will be a price that needs to be paid for that at some point in the future?
NEUT23|And how soon?
NEUT24|Sure, the nice thing about having proper risk mitigation is you don't need to be correct with the answers to those questions.
NEUT25|We could certainly see.
BULL26|Like I said, stimulus driving the market significantly higher, but the effectiveness of stimulus can wane, and ultimately the markets are much bigger than central banks are.
NEUT27|So trying to figure out when that day will come is impossible.
NEUT28|You know there's no tactical way to position yourself or something like that.
NEUT29|It's why your risk mitigation needs to be strategic.
NEUT30|You need to always have it on, regardless of what your thesis is.
BULL31|Brandon, thanks for joining us.
BULL32|Good to see.
BULL33|Thank you very much.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
