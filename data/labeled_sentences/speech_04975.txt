NEUT0|"""It's clear in this via video chart on ticker symbol NNDM."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|We're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the the obvious, but I will anyway just to build some context here, but very impressive movement on this one today.
BEAR5|When you factor in that during that opening part of the day, the prices actually dropped all the way down there, yet the price managed to close all the way up there, so any rational person said, yeah, that was definitely a very impressive move, but that does bring about the valid question of.
NEUT6|But is there any sort of true power behind this president?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT8|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat bounce that move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
NEUT11|In that area is down here at the $8.00 mark wise $8.00 important and I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation saying if the price were to come down here, behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT12|That would quite literally be putting the price right back to where it was at those lows.
NEUT13|I mean not to insult your intelligence but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly centered.
NEUT14|Genuine power, true strength or anything of that nature.
NEUT15|But I mean to be fair, no pricing, just go straight up either.
NEUT16|So maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner then starts works way back upwards.
NEUT17|Now a sudden what you have while you have a set of those, there you have those right there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps where you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT18|And that's the name of the game.
BULL19|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT20|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined at $8.00 in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT21|Main battleground to watch all about that purple line right there, the 50.
NEUT22|Moving average which you can see here as rejected the price down a couple of times and prices wealth in striking distance of it, but that will be the big question mark.
NEUT23|Moving forward is can the price actually break above that level?
BULL24|Which currently valued over there at $8.50, but overall nice bounce today.
BULL25|Let's see if the price can build up on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|Going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR32|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT35|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end, I open it up for a question and answer session.
