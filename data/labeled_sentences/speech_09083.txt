BULL0|"""Is Bristol Myers Squibb a good investment?"
BULL1|May be undervalued and also as I could predict that regenerx on will increase 50%.
NEUT2|I'll show you in this video.
NEUT3|Hi, I'm Rob and now for the stock of the week.
NEUT4|This week I've picked Bristol Myers Squibb for you.
NEUT5|As you can see, Bristol Myers Squibb is almost 100% undervalued, so you can get this great company for half the price.
NEUT6|Or as Warren Buffett would say, you get a dollar for $0.50.
BULL7|Bristol Myers Squibb is a great company.
NEUT8|As you can see in the risk analysis.
BEAR9|The only negative is that new shares were issued last year, which is not a good thing as that dilutes the old shares.
NEUT10|But that doesn't concern us as we won't hold the stock for long.
NEUT11|Will buy Bristol Myers Squibb when it breaks resistance at $64 and then will sell again at fair value with about 100% profit.
BULL12|This saves us potential losses from diluting the shares, and when the share price goes up, we're there.
BULL13|OK, now how could I predict the 50% increase on regenerx on Pharmaceuticals?
BULL14|With top graphs you can see at a glance that Regeneron has been doing very well the last years.
BULL15|The revenue increased by 91% the EPS by 104% and the free cash flow by over 200%.
BEAR16|That the number of shares and the margin light up red is not good, but with four and 6% / 5 years, it is not that bad either.
NEUT17|So I waited until the resistance was broken and bought a little over $400 per share.
NEUT18|I then sold at fair value for $600 per share.
NEUT19|It's that simple.
NEUT20|Watch my other videos too.
NEUT21|It's always the same concept and big wins for everyone.
