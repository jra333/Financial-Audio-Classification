BEAR0|"""Passion are cashing with his morning note says there is a bit of a risk of a stall here."
NEUT1|What do you think?
BEAR2|Well, look, there's just tremendous buying in the stocks that have been completely trashed in the why I want to use a metaphor.
NEUT3|Member Gary Kelly was one.
NEUT4|He's the fabulous CEO of Southwest Air and I was wondering whether you think of bounce back and he said, listen, we have to have some place to go if there's some place to go, we can bounce back.
NEUT5|Well, suddenly we've got different.
NEUT6|We involved Universal wants to open.
NEUT7|We have Disney open.
NEUT8|We have a lot of different people going places trying to look forward to things so suddenly.
NEUT9|You've got a stock that did 70 million shares.
NEUT10|They offered at 2850.
BEAR11|It then went down to 2350.
NEUT12|Look at the thing now.
NEUT13|I mean it blew right through the 2850, so I think art may be right that to those who are coming on on top of the 2850 Seventy million shares, buying a 34 better have something to hang their hat on.
NEUT14|If this stock goes to 33 'cause we've got so much hot money, so much stupid money in the market that I've got to tell you.
NEUT15|I just think that people would get their heads handed to him.
NEUT16|Yeah yeah, Jim David Jim mentions Disney and we're going to talk to JPEG.
NEUT17|Yeah later on this morning in the 11:00 AM hour about their plans to present the state of Florida with the plans to open Walt Disney World.
NEUT18|Yeah, it's an important moment.
NEUT19|Of course.
NEUT20|We've said as goes Disney, so goes the country to some extent.
NEUT21|Of course, the ability to open the parks remember previously Mr Che Peck.
NEUT22|Of course, the CEO who took over last fall unexpectedly or actually earlier this year I forget my time anymore.
NEUT23|Given how long we've been in quarantine, but talked about, you know 2030% capacity is what they would sort of be aiming for it first, but I'll be curious to hear the update.
NEUT24|Of course, when you guys have him on Carl Jim back to the point you were making, which I think is an important one.
NEUT25|I mean yesterday I believe was a 6 standard deviation move from.
NEUT26|Growth into value value, but you're you're questioning, and perhaps rightly so, where the value is because you can move all you want into these sort of cyclical names.
NEUT27|Or these value names.
NEUT28|But if they don't have earnings below them, I'm not quite sure how long that move lasts or when we just get back to the good old growth trade that has served so many investors so well for, well, more than a decade now.
NEUT29|Well, I saw so many people in my Twitter file.
BEAR30|Actually a lot of complete morons and idiots.
NEUT31|And I but I say that.
NEUT32|Cantley's Jimmy chill.
NEUT33|I have to deviate and what people are saying is look for get fat.
NEUT34|Well, I mean like you forget, forget Facebook because the President tweeted that maybe he'll like legislate social media.
BULL35|Well, man, I got low and he's fantastic.
NEUT36|What a guy is that the most stupid thing you've ever heard and I I look at the different stocks and I look at Alphabet.
BEAR37|The numbers are too low.
BEAR38|I look at Netflix, the numbers are too low.
BEAR39|I look at Amazon, the numbers are too low.
NEUT40|I look at Apple numbers too low.
NEUT41|I look at Southwest.
BEAR42|The numbers are way too high.
NEUT43|I look at the gaming stocks.
NEUT44|Are you kidding me?
NEUT45|So that there's people going into a casino?
NEUT46|They're allowed to have half the number of people.
NEUT47|I mean look, this is not Eric repair doing a show in the middle of Liburna Den?
NEUT48|Then I might actually pay a little more.
NEUT49|That's the best restaurant in America.
NEUT50|These are companies that frankly are open for business and 50% of what they used to do.
NEUT51|And I love Disney own the stock forever, but 50% will have an earnings power.
NEUT52|You know Facebook's numbers are way too low, but the president might regulate the president does not need ability to regulate.
BULL53|Facebook stock was up.
NEUT54|Three really nice note.
NEUT55|So David, David, and Karl, the Fang trade, I always say the same thing.
NEUT56|It's been dead for three years.
NEUT57|Pronounced dead on this network or by the analysts.
NEUT58|And you know what?
NEUT59|"This is Lazarus and they want to read the Bible."""
