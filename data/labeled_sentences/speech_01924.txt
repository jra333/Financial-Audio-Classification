NEUT0|"""I'm Nathan Fisher combined Michael Sandler and I have almost 50 years experience helping people file bankruptcy."
NEUT1|We've helped thousands and thousands of people file Chapter 7 to eliminate their debts.
BEAR2|There are many more people who need to file, but haven't because of the cost.
NEUT3|We charge less to help more people, but there are those who can't get access to the system because they can't afford to pay $1000, two $1000, or even $3000 to file.
NEUT4|And those are usually the people who need it the most.
NEUT5|So Fisher Sandler is going to file your Chapter 7 bankruptcy case for just the $335 filing fee, and no attorney fees down.
NEUT6|That's right, nothing.
BEAR7|0 down bankruptcy.
