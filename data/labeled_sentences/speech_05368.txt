BULL0|"""It's been reported that Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and SpaceX, crossed the threshold to become the world's second richest person."
BEAR1|But we at Forbes maintain that Musk is not there yet and instead is the world's third richest Musk's net worth nearly quadrupled during the COVID-19 pandemic, going from 24.6 billion in mid March to 126.8 billion on November 24th.
BULL2|This surge put him past Bill Gates, who is now 4th richest an Mark Zuckerberg at 5th.
NEUT3|Musk trails, French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
NEUT4|So why exactly do we believe Musk is in 3rd place?
NEUT5|Well, it's a bit technical, so bear with us.
NEUT6|Musk owns 21% of Tesla, but he's pledged more than half his stake as collateral for personal loans because of this.
NEUT7|Forbes applies a 25% discount to his shareholding to account for the loans.
NEUT8|His net worth estimate also includes $25 billion worth of options that was awarded.
NEUT9|Since May 2020, this was part of a historic 12 trash compensation plan must became eligible for the 4th tranche in late October after Tesla exceeded the cumulative EBIT, a requirement, but Tesla has yet to confirm in public findings that it has certified the results, and a representative for Musk did not reply to a request for comment from Forbes in time for publication until the receipt of the fourth tranche is confirmed.
NEUT10|Forbes will only be counting some 25 million options from the package.
NEUT11|"Towards Musk's net worth."""
