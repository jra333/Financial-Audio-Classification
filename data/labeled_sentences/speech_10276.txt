BEAR0|"""Net revenues were still down 27% of the best, but the market seems to like it well because people thought they were."
NEUT1|Did that stop was going to, you know the numbers were gonna get crushed?
NEUT2|Yeah, and they didn't realize the chip Berg didn't stand still.
NEUT3|He went into action.
BULL4|Chip is great when we hear him tonight.
NEUT5|I think everyone should be impressed.
NEUT6|He he takes by the way, Sherry is incredibly shareholder friendly and has felt terrible about what happened.
NEUT7|No more, we look at that sea of green.
NEUT8|Sky blue yellow submarine.
NEUT9|Yeah Carl, this is what happens if you do.
NEUT10|If you invest by tweet Alright can we just caution investors that if you're just going to look at the president's tweet, you're going to end up on the wrong side of the trade.
NEUT11|I mean, it is really incredible you would see his tweets sell.
NEUT12|I mean, can we be?
NEUT13|Can people be that ignorant?
NEUT14|He's arbitrary and capricious on Twitter, so if he says sell on Twitter, you might.
NEUT15|Yeah, I mean the bull case is being written this morning.
NEUT16|Jim, as you know, are about the market pricing in stimulus, whenever whether it's this week next week, whether it's after November, whether it's in January that it's coming somehow right and the other notion is that I mean look Biden up 16 in the CNN poll, and you know, we're not putting credence behind polls.
NEUT17|But as the polls widen, the likelihood, some right Barclays is the one this morning of a contested election.
NEUT18|Come down and the market seems to like that idea of just the market.
NEUT19|Love that.
NEUT20|Of course, the president can't love it, and the president's.
NEUT21|I think he's counting once again on people not willing to say that they're going to vote for Trump on these polls, but I think that what's going to happen is, is that the people who think that Biden is going to win, they feel their certainty.
NEUT22|People who feel that Trump's going to win.
NEUT23|They like the fact that Trump's good for the stock market and so you have these two groups call Lessing once again, and if the president just doesn't go on Twitter, he could get a multi day rally.
NEUT24|David, he had multi Day rally going the just look the president says I do.
NEUT25|I know he does not focus on 50 day and 200 day 'cause I've spoken him about stuff.
NEUT26|That's not his thing.
NEUT27|He actually cares about the actual company, right?
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
