NEUT1|This is all source reporting by the Financial Times that they're putting for the Saudi Public Investment Fund has built up this undisclosed stake.
NEUT2|They're putting a size of it about 3 to 5% of the total shares of the companies, or three to 5% stake.
NEUT3|They're saying that, again, those sources familiar say that that steak is now worth between 1.7 and around $2.9 billion.
BEAR4|The steak is below the 5% threshold that requires a public disclosure in the US for those publicly traded stocks.
NEUT5|The exact timing of the purchase is unknown, although the sources familiar say that it took place.
NEUT6|After the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman took a tour of the US back in March.
NEUT7|Also worth noting here that another big investor foreign in Tesla shares last year was through Chinese Internet company Tencent.
NEUT8|They took a stake in Tesla last year about $1.7 billion, or about a 5% stake as well.
NEUT9|So it looks like Tesla shares moving on this and of course got the other added dynamic to this.
