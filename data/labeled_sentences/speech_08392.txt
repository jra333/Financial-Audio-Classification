NEUT0|"""Hi friends, David Sidoni years July 2012."
NEUT1|Now yesterday I made a video was all set to send it out to you was a media recap of the housing stats for the year so far.
NEUT2|But then this morning I opened up the Wall Street Journal and I saw this thought it was important.
NEUT3|So I want to make sure that I passed it on to you.
NEUT4|It's an article about the National Housing market finally bottoming out.
BEAR5|As far as we go locali here in Orange County, we saw the steady drop again when our bubble burst almost seven years ago.
BEAR6|Drop down until it bottomed out at the beginning of 2009 and since then we haven't dipped below that bottom.
NEUT7|But we've only seen marginal ups and downs the last three years, but the 2012 data is finally starting to give us some hope so you can check out the link below to see what the Wall Street Journal is reporting today regarding the National Housing market.
NEUT8|Finally starting to turn the corner and then you could check out.
NEUT9|The next video on this web page and that was called Orange County 2012 midyear report that will give you all the details in the in depth analysis of what's happened over the last six months and how that housing data starting to affect not only where we are today, but where we're going.
BULL10|"Thanks so much and I hope this information is helpful."""
