NEUT2|So 1st of April 2021 Thursday to 50 after week were #6 polka dots with ticker DOT so what's up?
NEUT3|Robert Haber Myuran Gavin Woods.
BULL4|I hope all is well with you.
NEUT5|Obviously there not watching.
NEUT6|For who cannot?
BEAR7|Against BC already warned that it was a double bearish divergance.
BULL8|Higher higher prices were high on the MIC, D lower high on the RSI.
NEUT9|And you try and change could be coming, but at the same time we could be getting a yeah there could be a triple bearish look at this.
NEUT10|Look at how low it is.
NEUT11|Look at how close we are at the top.
BULL12|So I feel like we could just go slightly higher.
BULL13|Get another marginally higher high, and after that's we retraced right triple bearish divergance triple Q for Bogota against PDC.
NEUT14|Absolutely possible high and if that happens then.
NEUT15|Be a deeper retrace and we might retrace how much lower.
NEUT16|We're not exactly sure.
BEAR17|Some support here probably just take out the weeks over here around these levels, so entirely possible we're not discounting the possibility of very big retrace so.
BEAR18|Yeah we look very overbought.
NEUT19|Call very silence.
NEUT20|Be very careful about going to trade too soon, right?
NEUT21|Polka dots against USDT Bobby for at least this.

NEUT23|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about conducting documents we can look for pocket out against USD T here we are at #39 #37 dollars.
BULL24|We're expecting you to go higher to US $53.
NEUT25|This was a target given to you as a gift for you that you will very likely rise to US.
BEAR26|$53 on the 24th of March, which was last week.
NEUT27|So we are still elements that polka dots will hit $53 OK sounds like a rapper.
NEUT28|OK, anyway, we're still bias bullish poker dot polka dot.
BULL29|Still looks extremely good and we are still expecting big things to come for Polka Dot.
NEUT30|However that could be.
NEUT31|Tired and it may not continue on this crazy trajectory forever and so this could be a with four right?
NEUT32|Another symmetrical triangle with one with two with tree with four with five right.
NEUT33|When things move impulsively towards the upside.
NEUT34|Normally they move in five waves.
NEUT35|12345 with tree is usually the longest, never the shortest, so you could see that we fund is will be shot with trees so long after that they'll be here.
NEUT36|With five here, I'm not so sure how much Wi-Fi is going to be.
NEUT37|Maybe woo as well?
NEUT38|Or maybe just yeah, so it all depends upon the wheels off poker done.
NEUT39|I'm not aware of polka dots.
NEUT40|I cannot decide how much higher things are going to go, but we definitely have a target here at 53.
BULL41|And yeah, if you took a trade courtesy of us then good luck to you.
NEUT42|I think we're likely heading towards 53 very soon, so there you go.
NEUT43|Good luck if you do take a trait, remember that your stop losses.
BEAR44|Things can go wrong anytime and things just start plunging and no guarantees that we're going to hit targets.
BULL45|But then again, we are still elements that our targets should be hit.
NEUT46|So yeah, there we go.
NEUT47|Good luck to you, and if you do decide to take a trade, Please remember to say stop losses.
