NEUT0|"""Steve Kornacki, now Steve."
NEUT1|You have some new exit polling data.
NEUT2|What do you see?
NEUT3|Well, we're getting a look here ship at the composition of the electorate for today's runoff election.
NEUT4|So what you see here is by race.
NEUT5|What does this electric look like?
NEUT6|And you can see today 62% white.
NEUT7|How does that compare to the November general election?
NEUT8|Was 61% white back in November?
NEUT9|Now 62%?
NEUT10|Not really much of a difference, but a little tick up, at least according to the exit poll.
NEUT11|Black, the black chair of the electric 29% in this exit poll, that is.
NEUT12|Right where it was in November 2929.
NEUT13|So very, very similar.
NEUT14|Probably not a surprise there when you think about how similar these races are, but then there's also this if you do it by age, here's where you might see a difference.
NEUT15|This group right here, the youngest group of voters under 30 in the November general election, this group made up 20% of the electorate in this exit poll.
BEAR16|Just 13%.
NEUT17|Wow, Steve.
NEUT18|As Priscilla mentioned, early voting broke records.
NEUT19|Democrats are encouraged by that, and the composition of the new voters.
NEUT20|How significant might the early vote be here?
NEUT21|So this is an interesting question here.
NEUT22|For Democrats, where would the early voting if what they get, what they were hoping for here?
NEUT23|Where are you going to see it?
NEUT24|You're going to see it in the place, right?
NEUT25|Down here.
NEUT26|What I'm circling.
NEUT27|This is where Albany, GA is.
NEUT28|This is one of those counties.
NEUT29|The City of Albany were Democrats.
NEUT30|Believe they really drove up black.
NEUT31|Turn out.
NEUT32|This is a majority.
BULL33|Black County Democrats believe they have significantly improved on the turn out of black voters in Dougherty County.
NEUT34|That's where Albany is in really in this whole region of Southwest Georgia.
NEUT35|So we're going to keep an eye on that tonight.
NEUT36|If the Democrats got what they were looking for in the early voting, this is one of those places where you're going to see it.
BULL37|And Conversely, the Republicans who are counting on same day turn out if they got the boost they're looking for.
NEUT38|North Georgia core Republican area.
BULL39|That's where you'll see the turn out boost for Republicans.
NEUT40|If they get it on Election Day.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
