NEUT0|"""The late great strategists Ray DeVos said that more money has been lost in the search for yield than at the point of a gun."
NEUT1|Utilities may be the latest thing to prove him right.
NEUT2|I'm Jack cartereditorbarrons.com.
NEUT3|I'm here with Ben Levisohn, senior Editor magazine, really interesting, streetwise column from you this weekend on utilities very popular right now.
NEUT4|First of all, why so popular?
NEUT5|Why they done so well?
NEUT6|And basically it's their yields with Treasury solo.
NEUT7|You have this sector that's offering 3% plus dividend yield, and that's really attractive.
NEUT8|It's about two percentage points more than you can get on a Treasury.
NEUT9|They're also pretty safe, and so when you have a world that looks very scary, the fact that they have very consistent earnings things the fact that most of the regulated makes him a safe sector, you put those two together.
BULL10|You get this incredible rally where they are up more than 20% on the year.
BULL11|So sounds great.
NEUT12|What could go wrong for utilities?
BEAR13|The problem now is that they've moved so much and their valuations have gotten so high that.
NEUT14|The best case scenario, probably at this point is that you clip your coupon, you get your speaking button, turn to get that 3% dividend yield, and that's really the best you can hope for at this point.
BEAR15|But there's a very good chance when you get this kind of run if we get more upside in the market that you're going underperform, they could even follow.
NEUT16|If people decide that they want to take their money out of utilities and put it into other sectors, what sort of valuations are we seeing?
NEUT17|I mean, they're just enormous.
NEUT18|I mean it.
NEUT19|Whichever way you look at it.
NEUT20|In some cases, the price to sales ratios, or like I think the highest since the 1990s, others are.
NEUT21|At the highest since the financial crisis went, of course, utilities were popular because, you know, they look safe in that environment to an even if you adjust them for where interest rates are, they still look expensive.
NEUT22|I think they have APE of about 19 now, and even with these interest rates you can maybe make a case for 18.
BULL23|So it's not that high, but it's still higher than would be even if these ridiculously low level of interest rates.
BEAR24|So if interest rates go up, you know we could just start a Stampede out of these stocks.
NEUT25|Anyone predicting the future would be wise to learn humility.
NEUT26|What could be wrong with our thesis?
NEUT27|Is there anything we're missing?
NEUT28|I mean, I think the thing that we're missing is out.
BULL29|Do yield stay this low interest bonds Bond will stay this low, which could continue to have this support for the yield plays.
NEUT30|Will the Fed stay on hold forever?
BULL31|That could give support you know, will the world remain as scary as it has been allotted?
NEUT32|Basically you have to be very pessimistic to think that.
BULL33|I think that utilities can go even higher.
BULL34|Thanks very much.
BULL35|"Better thank you."""
