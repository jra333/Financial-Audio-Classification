NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up?"
NEUT1|You guys.
NEUT2|Welcome back to the channel.
NEUT3|I want to talk about two.
NEUT4|We in this video.
NEUT5|So stock currently sitting at $74.00 levels and if you guys are not familiar with this stock, it's an online pet food store.
BULL6|Basically ecommerce has been doing very very well during this year and.
NEUT7|Let's take a look at their look at the stocks technical.
NEUT8|So at the moment 7450 it closed on Friday.
NEUT9|If we zoom out to one year one day chart, pretty much every single candle represents one one day.
NEUT10|So right here we did break out.
BULL11|We did break out this trendline, great trendline, and now stock has made this $75 all time highs right here.
BULL12|Now we're about to test this level, and if we get over, I am bullish.
NEUT13|This name for Breakout.
BULL14|But also they have earnings coming up.
NEUT15|And if I look for the past, say 3/4 earnings it doesn't move much off of earnings, so this was I think you won.
NEUT16|This was Q2 now there about to report Q30 on key two.
NEUT17|I think right here when it sold off we had all those like Maxine headlines and maybe even, I think even overall market was selling off so.
NEUT18|I'm watching this name for the for the rest of December to the upside, and if I can take a look at the option stats, I can only just take a look at this one.
BULL19|Friday's stats call buying volume.
NEUT20|Was three times more than the puts so and also I'm interested.
NEUT21|I'm not interested in short terms and is a disclosure.
NEUT22|I'll say that I don't.
NEUT23|I don't own any shares or options on this name, it's just potentially setting up as a good trade for me.
NEUT24|If I see those levels break out.
NEUT25|And also I'm not looking at short term, so I'm looking at something like, say, January 2015.
NEUT26|I mean 2015 to January 2021.
NEUT27|I'm looking more of like.
NEUT28|$100 strike price.
NEUT29|Options and implied volatility on those 68%, right?
NEUT30|So stock is implying by.
NEUT31|January 15th around.
NEUT32|$15 move so I am looking at that and also if we take a look at the 50 day.
NEUT33|Moving average which is this yellow line he has always been bouncing off of that level.
NEUT34|And also if you just just just look at it for less.
NEUT35|Pause for like 30 seconds and if you look at the chart it is not an easy stock to trade, it's just moves when it moves and then if it chops around it's gonna chop around like for like 10.
NEUT36|1010 straight days of stations.
NEUT37|Pretty much if I do nothing and just trade it in the range so that the stocks ranges around like $3.67 at the moment.
NEUT38|Ever true range and the market capitalization of this stock is $30 billion.
NEUT39|An outstanding shares reported big 400,000,000.
NEUT40|So that's why I would be careful with like short terms and be nimble.
NEUT41|If I trade this one.
NEUT42|With the with a short term breakout said like short term weekly contracts.
NEUT43|So that's that with this name.
NEUT44|By no means it's a recommendation to buy or sell, so that's just my pain.
NEUT45|Thanks for watching and I will see you guys in the next video.
NEUT46|"Peace."""
