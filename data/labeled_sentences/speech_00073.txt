NEUT0|"""What's up ****?"
NEUT1|I hope everybody had a great weekend, so let's go ahead and talk about new.
NEUT2|But before we talk about now if that's your first time watching that Channel, don't forget to click that subscribe button.
BULL3|So what do we expect from next week we expect from May of next week is to raise from the $55 to hit sixty 6264, specially because they're gonna announce their earnings on March 1st, which I see them hitting their earnings hitting their target.
NEUT4|That's why I still see nearby.
NEUT5|You're talking about stuff that's $55 per share from down from all time high, which was around $66 per share.
BEAR6|So you're talking about 20% down which the stock was down.
BEAR7|I don't see any reason for the stock being down last week.
NEUT8|The only reason I might think is like because of lucid motor that people were like more focused on lucid Motors and the merger that's going to happen.
NEUT9|So people like stay away more from Neo from Tesla X.
BULL10|Buying from Lee from all the other other EV players.
NEUT11|That's why.
NEUT12|But then.
NEUT13|You have to remember we have earnings March 1st, which is a week from today.
BULL14|So that's why I seen you going back again to all time high and maybe seeing a new all time high.
BULL15|It's still it's good like to see that there is a huge support around.
NEUT16|$54.00 per share.
NEUT17|Still, there is a huge support on that line and then I think next week the first thing is to hit.
NEUT18|5959 is going to be resistant point.
NEUT19|I see that specially if you look at the week here.
BEAR20|We're trading at 59 and then we slipped all the way down, so that's why I see 59 is a resistant point.
BULL21|Once we pass that 59, we gonna be like more heading toward the $64 per share.
BEAR22|News expected to report $16.00 loss per share.
NEUT23|But if you, if you compare it to last year, was four cent per share, but they expected to report like $0.16 plus for sure.
NEUT24|If the expected delivered already in December 7000 dollars, 7000 cores that 121% year over year for the gonna reported for the third fourth quarter for 2020, which they deliver the 17,353 vehicles in that three months.
NEUT25|So I still see them like growing, growing, growing.
NEUT26|Before meaning is a long term player.
NEUT27|So if you want to get a name you have to hold it.
NEUT28|As I said, for between three to five years from today.
BULL29|I expect we're going to see the $100 per share this year in 2-3 years.
NEUT30|We might like see it 5X6 X 7X from the money.
NEUT31|That's why I'm still holding my position and 800 shares average cost for $49.00 per share an I'm going to add more whenever it dips.
BULL32|"And thanks for watching."""
