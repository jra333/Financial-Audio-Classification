NEUT7|Caterpillar gets a bouncy 80 an you will see that right here.
NEUT8|Caterpillar, you can see the colored phasing in here, so sometimes we do this.
NEUT9|It's a different way to illustrate here.
NEUT10|You see what we call the large harmonic family and in there each of these is made up of two smaller ones.
NEUT11|You can see that.
NEUT12|So the low right here made a double bottom beautiful right the low right over here.
NEUT13|Pretty much on time and then the two minor cycles that make up the dominant one minor cycle, 2 minor cycles makes a low right on time this low.
NEUT14|Right on time, this lower right over here, incredibly late and the reason for that is because of the massive move to cash.
BEAR15|All that liquidation people got caught.
BEAR16|Trapped in this big decline, so it took forever for this to get sold out and capitulate on the downside.
NEUT17|And then you get the rebound where into the cell zones?
NEUT18|Look at this trying to get to the 50% right there and then started to back off all of our level four members.
NEUT19|By the way, get these charts.
NEUT20|Live on their T OS platform and that's our preferred broker and our level three members get the static charts of these in the simulator ranking system.
NEUT21|So will ever three or four members have ways to get our charts like this?
NEUT22|We're in this rally that's again 2 weeks old and you know you look at this one here.
NEUT23|This screen to the upside for five weeks.
NEUT24|This was five weeks.
NEUT25|This was about 4-5 weeks.
NEUT26|This was about 5 to 7 weeks so you can see there's still some upside in here and that's why we haven't projected to try to get up here to about 119.
BEAR27|But then we think this dominant cycle pattern is going to push down into that June July.
BEAR28|Where we think the market is going to get sold very hard.
NEUT29|That makes this a cell zona shorting zone.
NEUT30|Whatever fits your style, whatever fits your personality or your own portfolio.
NEUT31|That's why we give you this information.
NEUT32|It's made up of our swing, high swing, low analysis.
NEUT33|We have a video for that in the Cycle Analysis Workshop there are two videos for that in tools for texts in our regular level.
NEUT34|2 memberships.
NEUT35|Lots of ways to learn this stuff, so Caterpillar in the cell zone probably has a little bit more time.
NEUT36|8% gain on the week City they came out, and said that this stock is a buy an we say it's a cell.
BEAR37|"That's where we stand much in contrast to a lot of analysts that may be calling some of these things that are rebounding a buy."""
