NEUT0|"""OK, we're looking at Cigna stock, so the market scanner."
NEUT1|Sent me too.
NEUT2|This this particular stock.
NEUT3|And it is June 3rd, 2019 Monday evening.
NEUT4|And I'm just doing what I do every day and that's look for stocks to profit on for tomorrow so.
NEUT5|OK, we're looking at Cigna and Cigna.
NEUT6|Looks to me like it's clearly been bearish, but it looks like it wants to rebound tomorrow, so I'm going to see if I can catch a break.
NEUT7|Which is a signal on a lower time frame.
NEUT8|I can get in and ride this up a bit because I just just everything is kind of lining up that it's it wants a rebound.
NEUT9|The monthly were extended our extended indicator these.
BULL10|These four green dots down here are telling me this needs to rebound.
NEUT11|And just the weekly chart you can see here.
NEUT12|It's.
NEUT13|Holding these lows.
NEUT14|Right from last week to the start of this week.
NEUT15|And the daily chart is just telling me all the same things too.
NEUT16|It's holding the low over here and that low is 141, ninety five.
NEUT17|It's holding that low.
BEAR18|And it came down and made a higher low which is key.
NEUT19|And now it's breaking out.
NEUT20|It's telling me that it's going to break, so let's check in in the next couple of days and see how we do on this one.
NEUT21|OK, we're looking at this stock.
NEUT22|CI symbol CI An I was looking at this right here on the 3rd.
BULL23|And I was pretty confident that this was going to go up.
BULL24|He's very confident.
NEUT25|As I usually am just with all my years of experience and just the overall reliability of this scanner that gives me these signals.
NEUT26|So once I saw that I was pretty confident and I put this into my list for looking at stocks in the bull.
NEUT27|The long list.
NEUT28|For June 4th.
NEUT29|So I was able to get in and I exited.
NEUT30|Yesterday on the 7th.
BULL31|Now, I still think this can go go higher.
NEUT32|But just based on the weekly and the monthly.
NEUT33|But I don't like to hold stocks too too long.
NEUT34|Sometimes it will be.
NEUT35|A week to two weeks, but that's very rare.
NEUT36|It's usually one to three days, typically.
NEUT37|Because there's just so many opportunities.
BULL38|And I can make great money just getting in on a trade at one 5250.
NEUT39|And exiting at 157 a few days later.
BULL40|So this was a successful trade.
