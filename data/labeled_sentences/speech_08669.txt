NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|So today I'm going to be talking about the near stock.
NEUT2|Please give us a video a like as it only takes not point normal seconds and let's get straight into the video.
BEAR3|Sophie fan quiz analysis at Goldman Sachs still stands with his $7.00 price target for the near stock after he previously downgraded the stock to neutral and he's basically saying that the stock has increased too high and a lot of near investors may have been too overoptimistic, especially with everyone putting money and investing into EV stocks lately as that is why the hype is that the stock has been increasing.
BEAR4|I spoke to recently and now we're seeing a pullback for the near stock as a stock price went down, 14% hasn't thief, and downgraded the stock to sell a lot of people have been saying that the same day.
BEAR5|The analysis at Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to sell.
NEUT6|Garner ***** actually bought more shares in the company I was trying to find out the source for this online and I'll do my research and I could not find any source that sure that they bought more shares on that day.
NEUT7|There is some speculation that they purchased around 700,000 shares plus on the same day that they said to sell.
NEUT8|If that is correct.
NEUT9|Then they got a lot of investors to probably panic and sell off their shares as quickly as possible, so that way Goldman Sachs would get in more of a position at a lower cost basis.
NEUT10|But the fact that they would purchase more shares on the same day that I said to sell sounds kind of dirty to me, and it was probably tactic for them to load up more shares and those that did sell their shares will probably be buying back in at much higher price, as I think that the near stock will move up again.
NEUT11|Or what I know is that Goldman Sachs have a position of currently something around 10 million shares in the near stock, yet fee thanks.
NEUT12|Still downgraded it.
NEUT13|So some good news that we have for the near stock that they announced at their 50th 1000 car.
BULL14|Went off the production line, it says here that near has an agreement with sticks Chinese banks.
NEUT15|He will give a credit line worth $1.4 billion.
NEUT16|Let's just have a look at this article here which shows how many vehicles near has delivered in the past few months.
NEUT17|So near delivered 3240 vehicles in June and this is their monthly record that they have set currently date and over here we can see how the previous months have performed.
BULL18|This is quite good record to set considering that they are being able to ship and deliver these vehicles to clients during the pandemic.
BULL19|We can also see here that compared of last year in the same month this was a 179.1% growth rate.
NEUT20|In general, are passing do not think that the Chinese government will let his company go bankrupt as they want to be in the EV market themselves.
NEUT21|And it is a company that they want to see thrive because it is a manufacturing company that is on their Homeland.
BULL22|I think that the comments are looking promising for the company.
NEUT23|In my opinion in terms of where the stock is saying that right now, I do think that it is quite a cheap stock as it is only 11.09 dollars.
BULL24|It definitely has potential to increase to $60.00 in the future.
NEUT25|I see the near stock has a long term hold for a couple of years and that is it for today.
NEUT26|Video let me know down below in the comments section what you think this company and what your position will be on Monday.
BULL27|"As always, thanks for watching and enjoy the rest of your day."""
