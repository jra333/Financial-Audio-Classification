NEUT0|"""So I want to ask a little bit about some of the new investing things going on in the markets and Greg Wondra from Bakersfield wonders about target date funds and I wanted to also ask about all the new index funds with the brain."
NEUT1|Are those things really adding value?
NEUT2|No, probably not.
NEUT3|The the S&P 500 index is on this one to use.
NEUT4|That's the one I used in that bed I made for 10 years.
NEUT5|It's the one I've told the trustee for my wife to put 90% of the funds island lever into the S&P 500 is.
NEUT6|I don't know whether it's 80% of the market value of you know everything you can buy in this country in the it's over.
NEUT7|I think it's over 20 trillion and you're buying America and.
NEUT8|Let me give me a figure that will blow your mind.
NEUT9|I think I bought my first stock when I was 11 years old.
NEUT10|It was the first quarter of 1942, shortly after Pearl Harbor.
NEUT11|I spent $114.75, three three shares hundred 1475.
NEUT12|If I put that 114 into the S&P 500 at that time and reinvested the dividends.
NEUT13|Think of it figures to what it might be would be worth today.
BULL14|Oman, well, it's OK.
NEUT15|I just want your audience to think for a second.
NEUT16|OK, the answer?
NEUT17|The answer is about $400,000.
NEUT18|So if I was a little kid taking that 114 bucks, I'd saved shoveling snow or whatever.
NEUT19|Done $400,000 today.
BEAR20|One person's life cut.
NEUT21|That's America.
NEUT22|That doesn't mean you know, it's it is the huge tailwind.
NEUT23|The American economy gives to any equity investor.
BEAR24|Now the markets going down many times.
NEUT25|During that time people of panic during that time headlines have been terrible, you know, look like we're losing the War One first one, but America is a powerful economic machine that since 1776 is working, it's going to keep working now.
NEUT26|You don't want to buy to hold for a year.
NEUT27|You don't want to buy with the idea that you can sell it in two years or three years.
NEUT28|Necessarily make money you made.
NEUT29|You could lose money that way, but if you buy it for.
NEUT30|1020 just keep buying the S&P 500 index and forget about all the other nonsense is being sold because I'll guarantee one thing about something sold you.
NEUT31|It will carry bigger fees and what I'm talking about.
NEUT32|Yeah, and there's no reason to think that you're not.
NEUT33|We don't know if it's 400,000, but that same sort of processor returns won't happen starting right now.
BULL34|The S&P 500 companies have earned well over 10% on equity, often 15% annually for years and years and years and years.
NEUT35|I've done it all with Democratic administrations with Republican administrations.
NEUT36|Now you get money.
NEUT37|Com pounding at that kind of rate underlying your investment and you get a diversified group of that.
BULL38|"I mean, you're going to do well."""
