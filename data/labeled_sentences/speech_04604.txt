BEAR0|"""And of course, we need to talk about costs you can see costed dropped quite a bit today from."
NEUT1|You know that $22.00 market almost 23.
BEAR2|It opened at 2289 did end up getting to a low of 2110, which I would love to be in at.
NEUT3|But right now I'm currently in 100 shares at $23.53, so I'm kind of on the higher side.
NEUT4|I would have liked to take a profit out of this, but it's just a down market again.
BULL5|It's adapting to this down market.
NEUT6|Everything else.
NEUT7|Is you know, you know, nobody's really buying because they're afraid to buy these down prices, but they will end up buying somewhere in the after hours market.
BULL8|You might see that increase because these are massive sales that you actually getting on these positions, but costs definitely has those times where it can spike up.
NEUT9|It's still shorted position, so expect it to have a lot covered and also people buying at the same time.
NEUT10|So that's my opinion of it.
NEUT11|Hopefully you feel the same way.
NEUT12|"But yeah, that's me."""
