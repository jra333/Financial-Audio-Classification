BULL0|"""Hi folks, welcome to another video from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I am Owen Ben Alack and I'm going to talk today about my favorite dividend and it's a very, very peculiar dividend.
NEUT2|To have your favorite dividend because it gives me no cash.
NEUT3|It's the Banco Santander dividend which I elect receives a script evident.
NEUT4|What that means is 4 * A year.
NEUT5|Santander gives me more shares, so I've just had my latest batch and I had a modesty forbids me to reveal how many shares I had fools.
NEUT6|I had a certain number of shares well into.
BULL7|All figures and some new ones got rolled along my share count goes up.
NEUT8|This is happening four times a year because I think the bank fundamentally is perfectly strong and eventually in the fullness of time when we forgotten that Spain has 3-4 million houses, it doesn't need a lot of bad loans written on them.
NEUT9|Back.
NEUT10|Would be worth a lot more.
BULL11|I think having all these shares will be very valuable.
NEUT12|Now there are certain problems with this approach to getting a dividend, for instance, you need income.
NEUT13|You don't have any.
NEUT14|You could theoretically sell some of your shares and use the money for your ill gotten pursuits where you want to spend them.
NEUT15|That's one one thing you could do, but you know fundamentally, this is someone who's trying to build up their capital position.
NEUT16|Really.
BEAR17|Another problem with it is is Santa can't actually afford to pay this dividend in terms of earnings.
BEAR18|The dividend over the year comes out as about that kept at 60 euro cents a year for five years, which is about 51 P little bit less, and their earnings are much less than that.
NEUT19|But the good thing is something like 90% of Centenaire shareholders, including all the senior management elect to receive this same script.
NEUT20|Evidence that cash doesn't actually leave the business.
BEAR21|Obviously we're all getting diluted overtime.
NEUT22|It's not free.
BULL23|Money will have to share the business out more and more amongst ourselves, but equally this is a way for Santander to become stronger effectively.
NEUT24|It's like a capital raising and you know the little Spanish Grannys who need the cash and still get it.
BULL25|So really I think it's a win win.
NEUT26|So it's my favorite dividend.
NEUT27|"It's not a dividend that you can take to the public by round of drinks for your friends, but in fact that's twice my favorite dividend."""
