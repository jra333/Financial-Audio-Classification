NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Tuesday, February 16th an in this video I'm going to be talking about Ocugen Inc. Ticker symbol to CGN.
BULL2|Sarkissian had a good day today.
BULL3|It closed at 6.6% at $10.96 in the last video I was talking about a good support zone around the $9.20 and we could see here.
BULL4|It's been holding nicely looking at the Magdi You could see the Magdi is definitely very bullish at the moment.
BULL5|And in the RSI we're outside the overbought territory, which is always good.
BULL6|So basically it's looking very solid for us to continue the upward movement in the last video.
NEUT7|I also mentioned something very important is.
BULL8|I was watching a rounded bottom being formed and look how nicely it's rounding here, always a rounding bottom is a bullish turn, but we could definitely see an upside the coming days.
NEUT9|Switching over to the hourly chart you could see here the rounded turn.
NEUT10|A much clearer view.
BULL11|And since we are touching the 50 moving average, as long as we remain above it then we're definitely going to continue the upward trend.
BULL12|And I believe we could see a test of the $17.40 we can definitely see a retest of the resistance around the $17.47 very soon.
NEUT13|If we extrapolate this rounded curve.
NEUT14|Then we could see it around.
NEUT15|February 19th so we could definitely see it.
NEUT16|This pattern holds.
NEUT17|We could definitely see it happening this week.
BULL18|If not early next week for all looking great.
BULL19|Watch out always for the support level around the $9 and roughly $0.20 we have to stay above that for us to remain bullish.
NEUT20|Then that.
BULL21|From a technical perspective, it's looking good.
NEUT22|The setup is set up.
NEUT23|Keep an eye on this.
NEUT24|I'll post an updated video later this week and hopefully we could have a confirmation.
NEUT25|The continuation of the rounded bottom.
BULL26|"Visual thank you all for watching and see you in the next video."""
