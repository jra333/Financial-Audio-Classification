NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol Andi we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick."
NEUT1|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT2|In case maybe new charts instead of each one of these candle sticks here representing one days worth of price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT3|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT4|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT5|It's actually just today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT6|I'll let you this time frame that is a good job of telling the quote unquote story of the price, and in this situation makes mapping out a very logical question quite straightforward.
NEUT7|That question was around the fact that today the price made a very nice bounce.
NEUT8|I mean, when you consider the price was at its lows and then where it ultimately closed up there, any rational person and say yeah, that the Bulls definitely made a very nice bounce on the day, but this does lead to the valid question of.
NEUT9|But is there any sort of true power behind this bounce?
NEUT10|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead Cat bounce that move?
NEUT12|I have no idea, but like I said, by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves around this level right here at .012 wise .012.
NEUT13|So important.
BULL14|Well hopefully we can all agree on the logic.
BULL15|That price movement with true power with genuine strength the price is going to make progress in the upward direction or in other words, the price is going to keep on bouncing.
NEUT16|I'm assuming you're saying hey thanks Captain obvious.
NEUT17|Of course, if your price movement is truly powerful.
NEUT18|It's going to keep on bouncing or in other words, it's not going to go back to where it was, because that would be a contradiction exactly.
NEUT19|So.
NEUT20|With that in mind, think about .12.
NEUT21|Any sort of closes below there.
NEUT22|Or worse yet, if the price separates to the downside of that, what would that be doing to the price that would literally be putting the price right back into this range of the chart where it was when I was flirting with these Lausanne again going back, not a sign of true strength.
NEUT23|Let's say the price pulls back a little bit.
NEUT24|Behaved in this manner and then start to works way back upwards.
NEUT25|What would you have in this situation here?
NEUT26|Well, you have a set of Lowe's right there.
NEUT27|You would have that set of Lowe's down there if you picture each of these stair steps.
NEUT28|Will hey now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT29|And again, that's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL30|It's going to make progress forward.
NEUT31|It's going to quote unquote keep on bouncing and in this situation I'm quantifying the keep on bouncing point as .12 because if the price stays above there, that's got itself a nice little stair step and that's how things are all built.
NEUT32|All reversals gotta start somewhere and all reversals do start out of as bounces, but step one and all that is just making sure that the things actually a true bounce.
NEUT33|And again, a true Browns is going to show progress and progress, being defined as .12.
NEUT34|What about areas of resistance?
BULL35|Initial area right here at .0145 you can see the price got right up around that area several times today.
NEUT36|Couldn't quite push through it if the price can you know, turn around and get up through their next key level.
NEUT37|Keep an eye on is going to be that purple line right there, which is the 50.
NEUT38|Simple moving average.
NEUT39|So no doubt about it.
BULL40|Very nice bounce today on the Bulls part.
NEUT41|Not just a question of can the Bulls build upon this momentum going forward we shall see.
NEUT42|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT43|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT44|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT45|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT46|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT47|It's completely free.
NEUT48|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT49|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
