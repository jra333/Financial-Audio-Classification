NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|Today will be looking at USD CAD on the daily chart so zooming in we can see that the loonie is opposing the overwhelmingly bearish picture with its recent bounce off a newly formed three year low between the trust of one point 2450, an one point 2527 the pause in the fall in each mark, alliances reflecting the recent rebound in the price, while the sliding simple moving averages are safeguarding the prevailing negative tone.
BEAR2|Short term oscillators are reflecting mixed signals in directional momentum.
BULL3|If the pairs foothold at one point 2467 gains more traction resistance could originate around the 50 day MA at one point 2725 in line with the clouds lower surface.
BEAR4|In the event bias, push over these obstacles, they could face a heavy boundary at one point 2832 to one point 2880 an area which also includes a 100 days, so May.
BULL5|If this durable border fails to impede price improvements, the Bulls could then challenge another key resistance band from one point 2955 to one point 2993.
NEUT6|You're selling interest intensifies.
NEUT7|First downwards.
BEAR8|Limitations could arise from the support zone of one point 2527 to one point 2450, where the three year low also resides.
BEAR9|A violation of the multiyear bottom of one point 2467, and the latter level of one point 2450 may restart the pairs drop into deeper waters, meeting the one point 2378 barrier.
NEUT10|If the plunge persists, then the Bears could target the one point 2248 truck from January 2018.
NEUT11|Summarizing USD.
BEAR12|CAD retains a dominant bearish bias beneath the Smas and Cloud a shifting the price above one point 2832 to one point 2880 could shine some light onto a gloomier picture and start to undermine prices, bearish shackles.
NEUT13|That's it from me.
BULL14|"Have a great trading day."""
