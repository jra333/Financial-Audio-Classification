NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know she would behave."
NEUT1|We back with another is going to get right into it.
NEUT2|You know, when I waste my time before we do that, let's get this video.
NEUT3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people, but they were testing based on SOS Limited.
NEUT4|I'm just giving out a quick update.
NEUT5|A quick summary.
BEAR6|I know some Yasuo is always fouling fouling down to the $6 range.
NEUT7|I told you other people.
NEUT8|For it to test the five.
BEAR9|The high five five 7580 range to try to scare some weekend investors out and it could possibly worst case scenario it could possibly pull it down to 532.
NEUT10|Hopefully it don't.
NEUT11|Hopefully we don't see that but you always want appeared.
NEUT12|I just want to let you know inform you.
NEUT13|I told you this stock is heavily being manipulated because it's a simply play off of Bitcoin as Bitcoin goes up.
NEUT14|Is supposed to be going go down exposed?
NEUT15|Go down.
NEUT16|Bitcoin was trading at around $57,000 yesterday and when it's when SOS or Bitcoin is at 54 K, SOS is trading at around $10 range.
BEAR17|So SOS is way overdue, way oversold and a lot have to do it.
NEUT18|A lot of it had to do with that fraudulent news that had came out.
NEUT19|People saying that you know scan probably short sellers making fake reports saying that the company is fraudulent.
NEUT20|They fry they not a real company and all that good stuff.
BEAR21|All that probably goes into play with the manipulation of the stop right now or the stock price, but I do feel we will get hammered all through the day maybe and towards the end of the day since Friday will still nice spike towards the end of the day and into after hours.
BULL22|Especially with Bitcoin is up and holding his highs and come Monday.
BULL23|We most definitely should probably see a nice push.
NEUT24|A nice push or maybe we see the double digit numbers.
BULL25|And I feel we could see a nice, scary, scary true shape.
NEUT26|'cause it's going to try to get these weak hands and try to take investor shares right before the weekend.
NEUT27|Trying to take your shares so it can open up on Monday be so that don't mean going.
NEUT28|Put everything again on it 'cause you think it's always going to be like things going to open up.
NEUT29|Be there.
NEUT30|Just a possibility it should because this is simply play.
NEUT31|Also plays like this never go all in and never put no more than that.
NEUT32|You ain't willing to lose because it's just off.
BEAR33|High speculation in Bitcoin.
NEUT34|And is very volatile is like a rollercoaster underplays that we can put a lot of money in.
NEUT35|I will inform Alan plays like they'll let you know please.
NEUT36|You can put a lot of money in that's like such as Apple, Tesla, Neo.
NEUT37|We can go on and on.
NEUT38|No good companies, legit companies, Janelle on this ain't the video for that, but I'm just trying to let you know that you seem so that's all I really got this video I just want to give you a quick update on SOS and let you know don't have weekends and be shooting out, but always use what I told you as your knowledge.
NEUT39|If you is invested too heavily in it, once it reached once they reach where we had.
NEUT40|If it pulled back towards 599 you could possibly I. I'm not going to sell my shares because even if you go down to the forest I'm just going to go.
BEAR41|I'm down $400 right now, but I'm OK with that because I know I feel like it's going to go up an.
BEAR42|At this day, and pull down to 599 and if you too heavily and you could sell half of your shares and buy baking.
NEUT43|If it pulled down to five 3520 to give you a lower cost average.
NEUT44|So that's all I got for this video.
NEUT45|Hope you like these quick updates you already know she would behave.
NEUT46|We yeah, sorry I got it ain't so.
NEUT47|You already know we keep you keep him stay fresh or here, but sometimes early in the morning.
NEUT48|"I'm not just going to tank top on so yeah, yeah God bless."""
