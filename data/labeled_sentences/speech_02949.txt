NEUT0|"""Markets there really almost motionless, awaiting the Federal Open Market Committee statement later today."
BEAR1|So futures are flat.
NEUT2|John Shipman coming in right now.
BULL3|Alright, how you doing good so right couple things off the top that we had.
NEUT4|We had the ADP estimate on private July payrolls and then we had the two Q GDP report.
BULL5|Both of them were better than expected.
NEUT6|ADP we were expecting 183 thousand.
NEUT7|What do we get 200.
NEUT8|200 and.
BEAR9|The knee jerk reaction to that and stock futures was just the edge a little bit lower than we got.
NEUT10|The news is bad news right exactly?
BULL11|But then we got the two Q GDP report, which was also much better than expected.
BULL12|It came in at one point 7%.
BEAR13|The expectation had been about 0.9 exactly, and so I saw some as low as 0.5.
BULL14|So OK, so it's much more solid than expected.
BEAR15|And again futures sort of went a little bit lower and I think that the reading between the lines.
NEUT16|You can kind of think that the market is thinking the Fed might.
NEUT17|This is just another more evidence to push the Fed to people.
NEUT18|And speaking with the indicator, we really need to look for isn't for instance the ADP report.
BEAR19|GDP is important, but ATP is less important than the jobs report which we're getting this Friday.
NEUT20|So we're looking for that.
NEUT21|But let's move on to three stocks were looking at Facebook.
NEUT22|Has an interesting milestone.
BEAR23|It may eclipse it's threatening to get got within four cents yesterday.
BEAR24|Yeah, it was about six or seven cents away.
NEUT25|Last I looked from its $38.00 IPO price and I think in my ear right now we're looking at pre market.
NEUT26|It's $0.02 above it.
NEUT27|OK there you go talk about catharsis?
NEUT28|So obviously the story there the much better mobile business, mobile numbers and stuff like that.
BEAR29|So that's a psychological level hurdle there.
NEUT30|Next track, FedEx, FedEx tagging on to what Emily was just talking about with Ackman.
NEUT31|There were rumors that FedEx might be the industrial company that he would make a big big big investment in, or take a big stake in and turned out to be their product.
NEUT32|So your products and so some of the air actually is leaking out of FedEx is shares.
NEUT33|She did very nice not.
BEAR34|I think I think I'm firing you from your chair for markets move last I looked it was down about 1 1/2% but some of that premium that had been built in is coming all right.
BEAR35|I got 30 seconds last last stock Riverbed technologies is sort of the disaster of the morning.
BEAR36|The stock was down about 17% premarket after disappointing revenue numbers and it's two queues networking company that has a very volatile history.
BULL37|Surrounding its earnings, and so it had recovered.
BULL38|About 18% climbed about 18% since its or one Q earnings at the end of April and basically giving all of that back today.
NEUT39|It's trying to integrate an acquisition of a company called OPNET.
BEAR40|They run into some difficulties there and some weakness on their federal government business.
BULL41|"John Shipman, thanks so much for joining us pleasure."""
