BULL0|"""It taqlid, an we're bullish."
NEUT1|The Stampede is coming baby in case many of you are wondering why does this YouTube channel have boxing gloves?
NEUT2|Well, the boxing gloves are on every day is a fight every day is a fight for our financial freedom baby no need for a super long video here we're gonna get straight to the point and straight to the money.
NEUT3|In today's video we will be talking about zomedica ticker symbol ZOM.
NEUT4|At the end of the day the price of Zomedica was $1.80.
BEAR5|The stock loss $0.21.
NEUT6|Today.
NEUT7|Boy, if there was ever a time to get in an average your way down.
NEUT8|This is it.
NEUT9|But before we continue with this video, a quick disclaimer.
NEUT10|I am not a financial advisor.
NEUT11|Always do your own due diligence and research.
NEUT12|When you invest in any type of market.
NEUT13|When you do the homework and you do your research, you will come out winning bank on it.
NEUT14|Right here we got a headliner from Investorplace Zomedica's pet lab.
NEUT15|Product launch will push its value higher and as always right here on this channel, we're always doing that research.
NEUT16|Here's a piece from the article Zomedica made a decision last week to launch true Form a it's pet lab diagnostic system early.
BULL17|That launch brings in its first revenue an will help propel with.
NEUT18|Commercialization efforts as such, I believe that ZOM stock is worth at least 250 to $3.00 per share long term once it starts to take off.
BULL19|ZOM stock has been on a tear since the beginning of the year, up over 670% as of March 23rd, with it trading around $1.80 per share.
NEUT20|So really, as we can see here with Zomedica, they're very optimistic about the stock and what could happen with the stock going forward.
NEUT21|It isn't this big gigantic, gargantuan push up, but let's be honest here.
BULL22|Again, is again an right now from $1.80.
NEUT23|If this goes up to about 275 or $3, that is still a nice big chunk of money that you will be in the green an in the profit.
NEUT24|A lot of days like this.
NEUT25|This is what I say.
NEUT26|Red days today.
NEUT27|Green Day's tomorrow.
BEAR28|When you see that the market is down, I know that there is a lot of pessimistic people out there.
BEAR29|There's a lot of things, negative energy.
NEUT30|But at the end of the day, red just means another opportunity.
NEUT31|This thing is not going to go down forever.
NEUT32|Of course, this is if you believe in the stock.
NEUT33|If you are not a believer.
NEUT34|Then display of zomedica.
NEUT35|It is not for you, so always make sure that what you really want to do is what you want to do.
NEUT36|Don't just go investing blindly into any stock because you heard it or because someone said so due diligence.
NEUT37|My people I know many of you are wondering why is there no face behind the video wealth over fame.
NEUT38|Let's repeat that wealth over fame until the next time.
BULL39|"Send love to the Taqlid Legion."""
