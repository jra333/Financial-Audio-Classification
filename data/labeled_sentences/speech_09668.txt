NEUT0|"""Alright, so Josh, you know this is one of those things where if I were maybe hedge fund, I look at it and I say, well wait a second."
BULL1|Your return on investment threshold you expect lower ROI in the fourth quarter that you're spending a little more in order to be able to make the business better.
NEUT2|To me, that's what I demand of the CEO.
BULL3|I demand that is CEO spend money to make the business better and bigger.
NEUT4|And when are we going to get that into our thick heads?
BULL5|That's why your stocks been so great over the long term.
BULL6|Yeah, first we feel great about the discipline we've had in investing all along during during the last four years.
BULL7|And, you know, we're going to keep being super disciplined about our investment.
NEUT8|This is a moment when FC is really top of mind for millions of consumers and it's the perfect moment for Etsy to be leaning in an really investing in marketing.
NEUT9|We want to make sure that Etsy's brand is burned into the minds of 10s of millions of consumers and that they really understand what differentiates us.
NEUT10|Let's see what makes us so special so that we keep seeing that sustained momentum far, far into the future.
NEUT11|Right now I felt the most important part of the console is when you said you are now part of the site Geist.
NEUT12|I mean, that's what you always should aspire to, whether it be trying to make the top of the funnel bigger, whether it be advertising, you have to be part of the discussion now.
NEUT13|Maybe mast help you do that.
NEUT14|I know you had to mean look when I ordered thousands of masks.
NEUT15|I don't need a new mask every other week.
BEAR16|But something is happened.
NEUT17|I felt this quarter where people just said I'll go to Etsy.
NEUT18|As opposed to go to somebody else, and maybe it's covid whatever.
NEUT19|But you are top of mind.
NEUT20|Yeah.
NEUT21|I mean when you talk to consumers about who are the big e-commerce players or who's top of mind for them all the sudden, they'll say, oh, Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, target.
NEUT22|Well, we're suddenly in the same breath as brands that are 50 or 100 times bigger than Etsy.
BULL23|And we have the potential to be so much bigger than we are today.
NEUT24|It's just being about top of mind.
NEUT25|What's so great about Etsy is that we're not trying to be the same.
NEUT26|As everyone else, there are so many places coming on line right now that will sell you the exact same thing you can buy at 10 other places.
NEUT27|And then you're just trying to sell it cheaper or ship it faster at Etsy.
NEUT28|We really stand for something different you're buying from another human being.
NEUT29|The product is made just for you and we think that that is, you know, an opportunity that's massive and we're only beginning to unpack it.
