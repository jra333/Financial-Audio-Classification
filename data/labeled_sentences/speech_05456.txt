NEUT0|"""Let's get more about this potential subscription service and what it could mean for Walmart."
BULL1|Joining us is Oppenheimer's Rupesh Parikh Rupesh great to have you with us.
NEUT2|How do you view this kind of service when it comes to Walmart?
NEUT3|I mean if you take a look at Amazon's business for instance, this is a low margin business.
NEUT4|There are lots of costs involved in terms of the infrastructure to do all these sorts of deliveries, especially 2 hour deliveries.
BULL5|With this be positive for Walmart.
NEUT6|Yeah, so I do think it is deposit so as I look at this offer I think it's for Walmart.
NEUT7|Both the defensive and offensive move.
NEUT8|So clearly on the defensive front, Amazon rolled out free 2 hour delivery late last year, older prime members.
BULL9|So I think with this offering now, Walmart can better compete with Amazon because they can also offer that free delivery.
NEUT10|And then I think in the offensive front now having same to delivery, similar to a counter thing.
NEUT11|I think other players such as target think Walmart can take share from them and you know, on the grocery side if you look at your pure conventional growth which is Kroger, they don't offer free delivery currently.
BULL12|So I think this is also play to garner more share on the grocery category.
NEUT13|According to this report from Recode Rupesh.
NEUT14|Another offering that would be part of the subscription would be video entertainment.
NEUT15|It sounds like they could be going down this rabbit hole of potential spending, and I'm wondering if this maybe satisfies no category of shareholder.
BEAR16|Maybe you lose the value shareholder, who might be in Walmart for the sort of the steady you know.
BEAR17|Steady earnings and dependable performance and you don't satisfy the growth.
NEUT18|Investors who are looking for something like an Amazon.
NEUT19|Yes, I think that that part of the offering is still very unclear.
NEUT20|I think Walmart is more likely to partner with someone on the video side versus invest billions of dollars in creating their own video service.
NEUT21|So I would expect their partnership in some type of asset light type arrangement.
NEUT22|I mean, it's still unclear how they're going to be doing it, so I think that's really going to be down the road.
NEUT23|I think at first they launch the offering all the discounts and overtime they had.
NEUT24|These type of perks to make it more attractive.
NEUT25|Hey Rupesh Tim Seymour.
BULL26|Thanks for joining us.
NEUT27|What what?
NEUT28|Multiple?
NEUT29|Because?
NEUT30|You know we talked about walmart.com and if I think about the ability they have to move more of their business to e-commerce.
BULL31|We've seen in Covid they have a richer on line mix.
NEUT32|Some of these food trends where they compete on price are only getting better, but it's the.com multiple.
NEUT33|What do I do with it?
NEUT34|Yeah, so from multiple perspective you know Walmart is trading at all time, peak valuation, the mid 20s on ahnapee basis.
NEUT35|We think if this if this is a hit and you start to get more subscription type revenue.
BULL36|You actually start to gain, you know more of these stickier customers, and in the market I think would then believe that they're more likely to gain a greater share of their customers wallet.
BULL37|I think you could see further multiple expansion from here, so it's really interesting that Walmart is.
NEUT38|I mean, you look at this.
BEAR39|Stock is trading at the same level, with trading in late March, and you know, since then the market has changed some of the higher beta names in Walmart is really been left behind, even after his rally.
NEUT40|"So I think at these levels you're really not paying for this for this incremental offering, and I think from here as investors look for defense, I think I think you will see money start flowing back into Walmart shares."""
