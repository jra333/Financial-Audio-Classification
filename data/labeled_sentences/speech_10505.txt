NEUT2|Nolan ripped HBO Max as quote the worst streaming service he goes on to say Warner Brothers had an incredible machine for getting a filmmaker's workout everywhere, both in theaters and in the home, and they are dismantling let dismantling it as we speak.
NEUT3|They don't even understand what they're losing.
NEUT4|Their decision makes no economic sense, and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption.
NEUT5|And dysfunction.
BULL6|Jim, yesterday we were speaking somewhat positively.
NEUT7|I think you were referencing a city node in.
