BULL0|"""The electric car market is heating up, tests the Neo and Nicola all looking to gain momentum."
NEUT1|Yahoo Finance Haicheng is back here with the details Heidi.
BEAR2|These stocks have been on fire absolute fire, despite I would argue a lack of good news to justify what.
NEUT3|Maybe bubbles well brain.
NEUT4|I don't know.
NEUT5|Investors have always been really bullish on Elon Musk and Tesla for that matter.
BEAR6|And like you mentioned though, they have been on massive rally so there is a bit of a cautious tone out there.
NEUT7|But let's start with Tesla here.
NEUT8|Tesla's Model 3.
BULL9|Think big success in Asia, specifically South Korea, though in June at the sold more than 2800 model threes in South Korea and now the car is the number 2 imported vehicle right behind the Mercedes E Class and ahead of the BMW 5 Series and Audi A6.
BEAR10|According to some reports, there are roughly 4000 to 5000 model threes in order in South Korea, and most of those will have to wait until September for delivery.
BULL11|Tessa initially had some issues gaining popularity in South Korea because.
NEUT12|The cars were ineligible for government incentive programs for electric vehicles, but those issues have since been resolved and as of last year, the Model 3 is on the market for a much lower price, including those government incentives.
BULL13|The car has also been getting some endorsements from big celebrities in South Korea, as well as the techies out there as well, so it'll be interesting to see if Tesla Model 3 will be able to take that number one imported car spot in the future.
BULL14|And honey, what can you tell us about Neo Neo, which is often referred to as the Tesla of China, is actually doing fairly well as well.
BULL15|It had a record June in terms of sales.
BULL16|Neo was the 5th best selling electric car in China and shares of that company are also near record highs.
BULL17|Neo had some big milestones in June, Bryant, it said.
BULL18|And you monthly record for deliveries, and it's finally surpassed 10,000 quarterly deliveries for the first time ever in Q2.
NEUT19|And you did mention Nicola earlier.
NEUT20|So I do want to touch on that.
NEUT21|Because there has been a lot of volatility for that hybrid truck company, the company did go public in early June and ended its first trading session at about $34 per share.
BEAR22|But just days after the IPO the stock closed at $79 a share and has since fallen steeply to close at around 40 bucks per share yesterday.
NEUT23|Now it's important to know Brian that there is no prototype for the Nikola truck and no manufacturing plant, just a vision at this point.
NEUT24|But the company does plan to show.
BEAR25|That prototype two investors in early December of this year.
NEUT26|It'll be interesting to see if that in fact does happen given the environment that we are in with coronavirus, but for now there are some very bullish people out there when it comes to Nicola.
NEUT27|They're all build up ideas you would say right all build up actually alright.
