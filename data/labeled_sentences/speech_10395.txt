NEUT4|Are we looking at a roaring 20s kind of rebound and uneven roaring 20s?
BULL5|Kind of rebound and thank you for having me Chef.
BULL6|They'll be a lot of people who will have so much and are going to do great.
NEUT7|You're going to go everywhere.
NEUT8|And then there's a whole other slug of people that it's going to be open for, but they can't go anywhere 'cause they don't have any money.
BEAR9|So it's an uneven boom.
NEUT10|Yeah, uneven is right.
BEAR11|The White House National Economic Director Jim pointed out to you and the squawk on the street crowd this morning that the unevenness of this recovery so far millions of jobs still gone.
NEUT12|Will this next relief bill help smooth all of that out?
NEUT13|Do you think?
BULL14|Well, I think it'll go far Tord that I mean, remember, we saw some dramatic gains among the people who basically I've described as being the majority of the country are the Caucasian market.
NEUT15|All right, the black people Hispanic.
BULL16|Chip, it's like things haven't happened good at all, and when I asked the economic advisor what's going to happen, he said, well, the hope is this package could help them.
NEUT17|I'm not sure this is a group of people that thrive on small business ship.
BEAR18|The small businesses were wiped out during this.
NEUT19|Where are their jobs?

NEUT25|Look at these Amazon Walmart Apple Tesla Tech hit especially hard, why and what should investors do alright?
NEUT26|Well, what people buy?
NEUT27|What stock market people buy is what we're going to buy once everybody gets their uh shots they want to go places so the airlines they want to do things so they'll be able to buy cars.
BULL28|Boy, the car sales are incredible.
NEUT29|But not the electric Connick Tronic vehicles.
NEUT30|The traditional guys.
NEUT31|So what's happened here Shep is is that people want to buy industries they don't want to buy these companies that a lot of people think are overvalued and are from a different era.
NEUT32|These younger investors, they want action.
NEUT33|They want to own things like the cruise lines because they know people will go for them.
NEUT34|They don't want to own things like Apple, which they think are funny.
NEUT35|Daddy, they're wrong, but that's the way they think.
