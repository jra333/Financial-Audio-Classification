BULL0|"""Shares of Tesla getting a huge bump in this session on the back of a bullish note from Wedbush analyst Dan Ives at let's bring in Emily McCormack, who's been looking at that note for us."
NEUT1|Upgrading the price target but is most bullish.
NEUT2|Call we're talking about more than $2000 a share.
NEUT3|That's right, akiko.
NEUT4|So taking a look at this raised price target that we have here from Dan Ives of Wedbush now looking for in $1900 per share on Tesla.
BULL5|That's up from the $1800 share price target that he had previously.
NEUT6|Now just taking a look at the stock overall shares of Tesla, of course.
BULL7|Up more than 300% for the year to date.
BULL8|Hitting a record high earlier in this session at about $18107.00.
NEUT9|That was intraday this afternoon.
NEUT10|Now taking a look at this call specifically from Wedbush.
NEUT11|Really what he was focusing on was the China growth story.
NEUT12|He mentioned that that alone is worth $400 port per share for it.
NEUT13|Tesla and this coming even as we just got a report out earlier today from the China Automotive information net.
NEUT14|Noting that July registrations.
BEAR15|For Tesla, vehicles in China were actually down 24%.
NEUT16|Now we did have Dan Ives on the 1st trade earlier this morning and what he said was that there is some pent up demand here in China.
NEUT17|In the electric vehicle market and especially for Tesla vehicles.
BULL18|So he does expect to see that actually bounced back in August and carry through until September.
NEUT19|He expects that for the full year 2020, that Tesla will hit 150,000 vehicle deliveries in China.
NEUT20|Remember that Shanghai Gigafactory did just get started.
BULL21|Here in the beginning of the year, so really a quick ramp up that we're seeing here from the Wall Street community having high expectations for the China story overall.
NEUT22|Key quote here.
BULL23|From this note from Dan Ives he said quote, we continue to believe electric vehicle demand in China is starting to accelerate in July.
BULL24|An August with Tesla competing with a number of domestic and international competitors for market share with Giga 3 remaining the linchpin of success, which remains the prize that Musk and Tesla are laser focused on capturing.
BULL25|We believe Tesla thus far in the third quarter has seen strong demand in Europe and China with the US market remaining softer to this point.
BULL26|Robust Model 3 demand out of China remains a linchpin of success and appears to be on a run rate to hit 150,000 unit deliveries in the first year out of the gates, four Giga 3 which is driving some strength for Tesla.
BULL27|Now of course that stock also getting a boost here as we have that stock split that five for one stock split about to take effect at the end of the month as well.
NEUT28|So really a number of catalysts here.
NEUT29|We also have battery Day coming up.
BULL30|In September, but for now at least, we have this bullish call here from Wedbush, and that is propelling the stock even higher.
BULL31|Today, Akiko nearly gains accelerating in the session up nearly 10% now.
BULL32|Thanks so much for that, Emily.
