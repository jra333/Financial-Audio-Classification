BEAR4|NIO shares were caught in a wave of selling triggered in part by signs that US interest rates may be on the rise.
BEAR5|In addition, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package moving through the US Congress has some economists and investors worried about inflation simply because it's a lot of money to dump into the economy.
NEUT6|That's almost certainly having an effect.
