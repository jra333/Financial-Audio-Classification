NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is a 22nd of March 2021.
NEUT2|Monday, the 1st day after we were at #33 name with the ticker XEM.
NEUT3|So for them against BTC.
NEUT4|This was a very big sell off.
BEAR5|Very big selling pressure, no no.
BULL6|If we are going to be recovering from this and if we do recover it is going to take some time and so yeah, things have really switch Parrish.
BULL7|We were above the skinny pink line things or bullish and after that we slice back under the skinny pink line so things separately switch, bearish for them against BTC.
BEAR8|We're going to pop lower potentially.
BEAR9|I don't see any clear signs of bullishness.
BEAR10|If anything things are very bearish right now.
NEUT11|So you need to be very careful about going into a tree.
NEUT12|For them, against BTC, right?
NEUT13|Let's move on to them against USD T. But before that please give this video a like.
NEUT14|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about them in the comments below for them against USD T these were very nice moves that came in for them 1234 or going to five.
NEUT15|Or are we going to use this already?
NEUT16|Eat right this one.
NEUT17|2345 years we don't really know exactly whether if the move has really ended or if there are still more upside to come.
BULL18|There's still more outside the comfort zone, but this is a very big sell to be honest for them against you City, and even even if we were to see any more upside, there's amount and very steep mountain to climb for them against USD T. However, we're still above the skin pink line and as long as we are above the skinny pink line.
BEAR19|We will remain bias bullish for them against UST.
NEUT20|So I think that the potential is there.
NEUT21|We could still pop higher, but this is a very big sell an we don't see any clear trade with patents.
NEUT22|So be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT23|Alright, I guess that's it for my exam technical analysis.
BULL24|Thank you very much for watching.
NEUT25|Stay safe, don't do anything.
NEUT26|"I wouldn't do and I guess I'll see you in the next video."""
