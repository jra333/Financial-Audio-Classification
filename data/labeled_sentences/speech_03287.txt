BULL0|"""I know we've spoken about ******* the interest rate somewhat to a gold price."
NEUT1|Maybe that would help the Fed stabilize rates, but really, how do we get the dollar strong at this point?
BEAR2|I mean its value is shrunk about 75% since 1975, or we just too far gone.
NEUT3|Well, you don't try to recreate the past.
NEUT4|What you do is you stop the bleeding and what that means is you will pick a price for a dollar gold price and then stick to it.
NEUT5|Now take a few months to have a transition.
NEUT6|But let's take 1500.
NEUT7|If you had a packet of $1500 an ounce, if it goes much above 1500, everyone knows you're going to tighten because much below 1500.
NEUT8|Everyone knows that you could ease it.
NEUT9|That's what the Fed hates.
NEUT10|You could have a couple of high school graduates do monetary policy with the gold stick.
NEUT11|But me sitting at home say deciding whether or not to make a purchase, how does knowing that the feds interest rate is pegged to a certain goal try to help me?
NEUT12|That's so much interest rate just a steady measure of value.
NEUT13|The dollar is like when you go to the supermarket you buy pound of hamburger.
NEUT14|You assume it's 16 ounces, not 18 ounces, not 12 ounces.
BEAR15|If you didn't know what a pound was each day you would, that would make shopping very difficult.
NEUT16|Is it enough to just say a dollar is going to be worth this amount of gold?
NEUT17|Well, you don't have to own more than an ounce.
NEUT18|All you do is look at the market price and you can give people the privilege if they want for one or two percent fee.
NEUT19|If they want to go and change their dollars for gold in Fort Knox, Fine.
NEUT20|But the key thing is you keep it within that small price range and it works.
NEUT21|We did it for 180 years one way or the other and.
BULL22|Did pretty well under it.
NEUT23|Do you advocate a gold coins and silver coins in circulation as well?
NEUT24|And the privatization of minting?
NEUT25|Well in terms of gold and silver coins, if you want to love those things around, find it's usually easier to use plastic or paper, but as long as it has a steady measure of value, you can use coins.
NEUT26|If you want to lug the things around, yeah, and we have a privatization be legalized rather than just rely on the US Mint.
NEUT27|Well in terms of right now in terms of creating the money, yes the government would be in charge of it.
NEUT28|But in terms of coinage, if you want to knockout a coin and it's you have it assayed.
NEUT29|People want to accept it fine, but most people would take with the feds, turn out and then should be negate all capital gains on gold coins on the sale of gold and silver coins.
NEUT30|Sure, especially gold.
NEUT31|Your silver is a different thing in the past because you know an ounce of gold is so valuable it's hard to make a coin that you can use to buy a Cup of coffee.
NEUT32|So you silver.
NEUT33|So it was a big history thing about what's the relationship between gold and silver.
NEUT34|That always get misaligned, so just keep the gold price study.
NEUT35|"People can keep their Dimes in their quarters in their dollar bills."""
