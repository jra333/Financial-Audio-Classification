NEUT0|"""OK Peter writes, should I be worried about Bear Stearns in terms of liquidy and get my money out there?"
BEAR1|No, no, no Bear Stearns is fine.
NEUT2|Do not take your money.
NEUT3|I didn't really look if there's one takeaway other than a + 400.
NEUT4|Somebody Bear Stearns is not in trouble.
NEUT5|I mean if anything I'm more likely to be taking over.
NEUT6|Don't move your money from fair.
NEUT7|That's just being silly.
NEUT8|Don't be silly.
NEUT9|OK, just so you get a sense of what's causing the agony.
NEUT10|By this point, I know you've been talking about it.
BEAR11|It's financials led by Bear Stearns, after what essentially is a bailout from the Fed Bear Stearns shares down 90% this morning and it's not just bear pretty much every single bank is plunging in early trade this morning.
BEAR12|Lehman, which is very similar to Bear and its reliance on fixed income, is down nearly 30%.
BEAR13|You have big names like Goldman Sachs, down 8%, Citigroup down 8%, so it is pain across the board this morning.
NEUT14|And as you know, it all emanates from.
NEUT15|This well the shock this weekend that JP Morgan along with the Fed was going to be bailing out Bear Stearns for $2.00 a share.
NEUT16|This is a stock that recently was trading at 80 last year, was trading at 160.
NEUT17|It is the fifth biggest bank on Wall Street.
BEAR18|It is significant in that it is establishing a price for some of these hard to value securities and as you are well aware, that price is pretty much 0 and that's why you're seeing pain across the street now.
NEUT19|"This also."""
