NEUT0|"""Disney issues its report on its finances later on this afternoon."
NEUT1|Mark Douglas follows Disney and he's with us now.
NEUT2|Mark, what could Disney say that would make you positive about the company?
BEAR3|We know they got problems with movies with theme parks with the cruisers they'd run.
NEUT4|What could they say that makes you turn around?
NEUT5|Be positive about it?
NEUT6|Well, I think you you mentioned all the businesses and an plus streaming and in the near term there's not a lot of positive to say.
BULL7|But I think the Disney brand is strong in the long term.
NEUT8|I think it's a by, you know you're gonna have to wait a year to see that price come back.
NEUT9|But people are not going to forget the Disney brand and not going to forget the theme parks, the cruises and and all these businesses in this brand that has been built.
NEUT10|It's almost like an opportunity of reinvestment in Disney as if it was day one in the company.
NEUT11|So I think.
NEUT12|People just have to look to the future.
NEUT13|What do you make of Disney plus their streaming service?
NEUT14|I ask because a lot of people tell me, look, it's it's a great service, but it's old stuff, whereas Netflix is all brand new stuff.
NEUT15|Yeah, I think Netflix right now is showing what $15 billion spent on content buys you.
NEUT16|It's just an endless stream of new shows.
NEUT17|I mean, it's I'm wondering when it's going to run out, but right now it's like every week there's a new movie.
NEUT18|There's a new show.
BEAR19|There's a new documentary and I think Disney is really suffering from that right now.
NEUT20|They didn't have the backlog account of new content that Netflix has, so but I think you know parents have a lot of kids at home.
BULL21|The Disney plus Brandon Disney Plus content is going to hold up and Netflix is really shining right now in comparison with Disney is so Disney just a bit hurting all around.
NEUT22|But the future is always going to be bright for a brand like that.
NEUT23|I'm told that Bob Iger is returned to take control of the whole company.
NEUT24|I mean, he stepped aside briefly, but I think he's back in the chair.
NEUT25|Running it again.
NEUT26|Does that make a difference?
NEUT27|You think?
NEUT28|I mean.
BULL29|To investor confidence.
NEUT30|Yeah, I think you know Bob Eiger.
NEUT31|Essentially they built a new Disney like he was an entrepreneur coming in and building Disney from scratch.
NEUT32|And that's essentially what's going to be needed over the next year and I think although they have a great management team, it cannot be understated.
NEUT33|He placed those bets in the past and now he's prepared is going to have the same confidence in bed to place those bets over the course of next year.
BULL34|So I think that's a great move for Disney and I think everyone would understand, including the.
NEUT35|CEO, that's kind of being pushed aside.
NEUT36|A little bit would understand why Bob is needed at this time.
NEUT37|OK, so to conclude, business at 101 now, but for a long term investor you think you get your money up to say 1:40 or 1:50 if you hold on for a year, does that sum it up?
NEUT38|Mark Douglas.
NEUT39|Yeah, yeah it does.
NEUT40|If not a bit high, I think people are going to be surprised at the speed of their recovery as things start to open up a bit, it's going to take a bit of time, but I think at least 140 if not.
BULL41|The continued rise as Disney plus grows when Hollywood opens back up.
NEUT42|Alright, Mr Douglas, you've been right before.
NEUT43|That's why you're on the show again and we will see you again real soon.
NEUT44|Mr Douglas.
BULL45|"Thank you very much indeed."""
