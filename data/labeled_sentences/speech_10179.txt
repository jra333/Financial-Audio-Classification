BULL0|"""Dan, thank you very much for joining us here."
NEUT1|I mean, what are the distinctions between the way Bitcoin is being traded, used, thought about that that you think is distinct from what happened three years ago.
BEAR2|Well, we have a bit coin shortage right now.
NEUT3|Every four years the number of bitcoins cut in half and that happened this summer and we have buyers now like PayPal who just themselves are consuming more than 100% of all the bitcoins that are issued.
BEAR4|So when you have big institutional buyers, big investors purchasing more than 100% of the bitcoins that are issued is going to cause the price to squeeze up.
NEUT5|When you say a shortage you mean a shortage of newly created Bitcoin relative to the demand, they're not shrinking the absolute amount right?
NEUT6|So, but I mean the demand is not some you know naturally occurring organic thing.
NEUT7|It seems as if there's a lot of trend following going on.
NEUT8|It seems as if a lot of people are facilitating the popularity of it.
NEUT9|And why does the price action have any connection to something beyond?
NEUT10|People seem to really like it.
NEUT11|Well, that's really it.
NEUT12|Like if 100,000,000 people think it's useful.
NEUT13|That that's why it has value and there's different uses some people use to store wealth.
NEUT14|Some people in emerging market countries that have banks that might be failing or have other issues with their currency use it to store money.
NEUT15|People used to send money across borders.
NEUT16|If you're a migrant, so there's lots of different use cases.
NEUT17|And six years ago there were only a million people on Earth that used it, and it was worth $200 of Bitcoin.
NEUT18|And now there's 100,000,000 people that use it.
NEUT19|It's worth $20,000, but.
BEAR20|We did see that little pullback yesterday in the price of Bitcoin, perhaps connected to some of these reports of, you know noise that the Treasury Department might be looking at some restrictions or or not.
NEUT21|But with these these things pop up from time to time.
BEAR22|Also, a reported hack of one of the bigger wallet providers.
NEUT23|We do hear this and you know SEC making move against Ripple I guess.
NEUT24|So a lot of things are undetermined in terms of the regulatory treatment.
NEUT25|Ultimately of this asset class, is that not a risk?
NEUT26|It is.
BEAR27|This is obviously very very early days for brand new asset class and so there's going to be volatility on both sides.
NEUT28|But you know those, create the news items that you know the migrant.
NEUT29|Using money using Bitcoin to send money back home to their mom in the Philippines.
NEUT30|That doesn't make the news, but that's really what's driving the price.
NEUT31|Well, I mean, but what's the ratio of people who are trading it to using it for something besides, you know as an asset class of speculative asset class?
NEUT32|I mean, you know, $100 bills are used to move money in Western Union used to move cash all over the world.
NEUT33|That stuff doesn't trade at a premium.
NEUT34|It doesn't go up three times in the year in value.
NEUT35|Sure, but is it Western Union 140 years to get where they're at today?
NEUT36|And Bitcoin is only 11 years old and already 7% of all remittance to Mexico's going over cryptocurrencies.
BULL37|So it's progressing a much faster rate than legacy system.
NEUT38|And you know one of the storylines, as you've mentioned, is bigger.
BULL39|Institutions are certainly allocating more in this area.
NEUT40|They've decided that it's something worth owning.
NEUT41|Perhaps instead of something like gold.
NEUT42|But are they any more reliable?
NEUT43|Are there?
NEUT44|Are they stronger hands than the than the individuals that seem to be driving things?
NEUT45|A few years ago, I think so.
BEAR46|In 2017 there was obviously a media frenzy around it.
NEUT47|There were all kinds of newly issued tokens that really didn't have.
NEUT48|Any basis to exist they were coming out and it really was a speculative frenzy.
NEUT49|This is being driven by the most famous global macro investors.
NEUT50|This is being driven by public companies like Square and PayPal and MicroStrategy.
NEUT51|Big endowments are buying, so you know, these are the types of people buying for, you know the five 1020 year horizon rather than just a quick flip.
NEUT52|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT53|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
