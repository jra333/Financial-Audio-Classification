NEUT0|"""So David, you were taking a look at the mortgage rates."
NEUT1|That includes Annaly Capital American Capital agency.
BEAR2|They were down today.
NEUT3|There was an announcement from the Fed last week that they are looking to move away from QE or starting to wind down QE.
NEUT4|What does this mean for the mortgage rates?
NEUT5|Well, it's not really a big surprise.
BEAR6|The mortgage rates have been trading lower for a month or so now.
BEAR7|Once American Capital Agency, they reported first quarter earnings is disappointing that some of their Holdings had declined in value because interest rates started to take up the anticipation of.
NEUT8|Starting to take up so it's interesting to see because it kind of highlights that when interest rates were low and everyone expected them to stay low, it was kind of not a great environment for these companies, but there wasn't a lot of uncertainty about what's the future going, but now that there's this winter rates going to rise, when is the Fed going to wind down?
NEUT9|QE is starting to cause some uncertainty and you're seeing that in stock price so the QE, and in particular the mortgage bond buying.
NEUT10|How does this impact the mortgage rates balance sheets right?
BULL11|So a company like American capital, they've seen huge growth in this.
NEUT12|In this market they've been expanding, so there's a lot of activity in this space, so the feds, in their their buying they're buying bonds, and when they buy those bonds, or those MBS, that's going to drive up the price.
NEUT13|So they've been applied to, maybe exactly, they've been buying these MBS at these agency.
NEUT14|MBS is.
NEUT15|And now that this had a pretty high price.
BEAR16|So when there's when there's worried that interest rates might might go higher, the prices on those buns that they're holding will go lower.
NEUT17|So that's where the concerns coming in that shape.
NEUT18|So now investors in these stocks.
NEUT19|Should they be worried?
NEUT20|I mean particularly looking long term.
NEUT21|Should they be concerned about this?
NEUT22|I think there is some concern that you have, but I don't know if it's a I gotta get out now before everything everything goes down.
NEUT23|I think if you if you're invested in this segment or in this sector and you want to be there for awhile, I would say hold on if you maybe a strategy could be to stop reinvesting the dividends that these mortgage REITs payout if you kind of want to dial back some some exposure to those to those companies but long term.
BULL24|When interest rates to rise, if it's a steeper yield curve, the companies they might, they might start to perform well again.
BEAR25|You can see that dividend come up so long term investors there's going to be headwinds.
NEUT26|It's a kind of a bionary will interest rates go up?
NEUT27|Will interest rates go down?
NEUT28|But if you if you like these companies and you like that dividend, I would say don't try to jump in and out and stay in there.
BULL29|Sounds good.
BULL30|"Thanks a lot Dave welcome."""
