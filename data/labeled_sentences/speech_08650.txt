NEUT0|"""Welcome to trade a stock."
NEUT1|Today I sold AGC oh for a $262.50 profit.
NEUT2|I watched the stock as it went up on huge volume right here.
BULL3|Broke out the high right here and as a start trailing, I actually did buy around the 71 dollar level right when it was approaching.
NEUT4|Is 58 day moving average.
BEAR5|Fortunately the market ended up crashing or going down a lot and I held onto it so I bought over here.
BULL6|Still great.
BEAR7|Stock came down with the whole market.
BULL8|Started to come back up again.
BULL9|It's still not overbought.
BULL10|Going up on pretty decent volume came back through the 50 day moving average.
NEUT11|I see a testing this number again, but I just wanted to get out of it and go onto a new stock.
NEUT12|So I did sell this for a profit.
NEUT13|If you're still in, it could still probably write it up.
NEUT14|Make some good money and I just basically sold it so I could buy those two other stocks that I put on the new video by stock thing today.
NEUT15|So if you want to see the stocks that I did buy today, they are in the videos.
NEUT16|Give them a look or come to the website.
NEUT17|Tradeastock.com alright.
NEUT18|"See ya."""
