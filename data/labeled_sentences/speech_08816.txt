NEUT0|"""Our attention now to a couple of companies that are set to come public later this week that the Air BNB and door Dash M McCormick joins us."
NEUT1|Now for the latest and let's begin with Air B&B.
BULL2|That company set to increase its target range and now its valuation is likely to be comfortably above where it was last valued or its high watermark.
NEUT3|I should say in the private markets.
NEUT4|That's right, miles.
NEUT5|Taking a look here.
NEUT6|Air BNB and door Dash both heading towards massive IPOs later this week.
NEUT7|In two of the largest offerings will get in 2020.
BULL8|Now it's looking like demand for these share offerings is high, especially with Air B&B.
BULL9|We just saw in a filing this morning that Air BNB increase the price range for its IPO.
BULL10|That new ranges between $56 and $60.00 per share, up from the $44 and $50 per share that Air BNB had disclosed in a filing earlier this month.
NEUT11|Now the company is offering 51.9 million shares.
BULL12|In that IPO, meaning that it would raise as much as $3.1 billion and have a fully diluted valuation of as much as 42 billion or more than double the valuation that it fetched in private markets earlier this year.
NEUT13|Now Air B&B's IPO is set to take place on Wednesday, so there's still a possibility here that that IPO range could be tweaked in the next couple of days.
NEUT14|That roadshow is still underway in the IPO, is still getting pitch to investors an after that.
NEUT15|Shares of Air BNB will start trading on the NASDAQ on Thursday.
NEUT16|Now this move by Air BNB this morning mirrors what we saw actually from door dash at the end of last week.
NEUT17|Remember that that company had also released a filing, increasing the range of its IPO, that company filing or saying that it would market 33 million shares for as much as $95 apiece.
BULL18|That's up from its previous range of between $75 and $85 per share, so taking a look with that IPO also set to raise as much as 3.1 billion at dollars and give the company a fully diluted valuation of as much as 35.
BULL19|Billion, so we will need to see in the next couple of days weather, door, dash and Air BNB are able to live up to the hype they've been getting the past couple of days, but for now it's looking like demand.
NEUT20|Here is high miles.
NEUT21|Alright Emily McCormick, the latest on those new issues.
NEUT22|Emily, I know we will talk to you as the week goes on Wednesday and Thursday.
NEUT23|"Again expected to be the debuts for Door, Dash and Air BNB respective."""
