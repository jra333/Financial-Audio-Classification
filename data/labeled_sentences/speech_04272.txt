NEUT0|"""Hi, welcome to this Blueberry Markets update with me."
NEUT1|John Kibler had currency analyst in this video.
NEUT2|We're going to take a look at Euro dollar's price as fans and resistance in his break into the downside, so euro dollar was on our list in the Forex market outlook for some short opportunities and what we looked at was the potential for the markets of it.
NEUT3|Come back into that one 2268 level, which is just.
NEUT4|Three here, however, Price hasn't made it.
NEUT5|Instead, it's just kind of traded within this.
BEAR6|Livalo another high pattern came into those previous structure modes here and has rejected going into today.
BEAR7|We start to see price dropped.
BULL8|The downside now if we do start to find a little bit of support in this little consolidation area here, we could expect the market to rally back up and this is what I'm looking for on euro dollar.
NEUT9|I'm actually looking to see if price can come back up and re test this previous area to then look for a continued short position.
NEUT10|Typically you get this sort of early sort of test of a level.
NEUT11|The market will then come battery test and it go again.
NEUT12|We can see that that's happened over here recently at that one 2268 level, so I'm interested in shorting euro dollar.
NEUT13|The daily closing bearish is only going to help with the opportunity of going short.
BULL14|We are approaching this area through here where the market has found resistance and support in the past so we could.
NEUT15|Found this to be a little bit of a sticking point, so just going into the 15 minute time frame.
NEUT16|We can see here today at that level price did start to.
NEUT17|Accumulate.
NEUT18|And what we typically look for is when price does that look for the markets, pull back into the level and look for the continuation to the downside.
NEUT19|This was something that we spoke about on Euro Yen and we spoke about the fact that if price breaks out of this area, look for price to try back within now.
NEUT20|Regards the 15 minute chart.
NEUT21|Zoom out slightly.
NEUT22|If we look at this one 2265 area.
BEAR23|What happened was the market accumulated.
NEUT24|In this level.
NEUT25|OK, so this is where.
NEUT26|The the institutions doing business in the markets.
BULL27|OK, we broke to the downside price come all the way back up into that one 2665 band of ejection and move nicely towards that 1/26/26 where you can see the market bounced perfectly off of it and could now potentially even reverse back towards this 125 one 2665 sort of area.
BEAR28|Or we could see obviously continue down so looking for the same situation here really on.
BULL29|"Euro price accumulated at these highs here, so if price can get back to that 122 fourteen that would be a good area to look to get short on the market in the short term that's watching this video update and I'll speak to you soon."""
