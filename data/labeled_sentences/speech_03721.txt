NEUT0|"""Sports, but again, you know the key thing is what are these physical supports?"
NEUT1|Are they going to be towards sustainable growth or will they just kind of be temporary and transitory in terms of creating a pop and growth that doesn't persist?
NEUT2|Would you have liked to have seen Dana more focus on unemployment benefits?
NEUT3|Whether that's overtime or immediately as opposed to broad stimulus checks?
NEUT4|Well, again, I think that you know there are variety of measures that are important here.
NEUT5|Certainly measures that can help people get back to work would be important, so anything that's going towards vaccinations and testing anything that's supporting businesses such as the PPP.
BEAR6|And certainly for folks who are still struggling, you know, a cash injection may not be a bad idea for those folks and also people who are, you know, still unemployed can also benefit from unemployment benefits, but again.
NEUT7|The key issue is reopening the economy and really the fiscal supports are just a stopgap.
NEUT8|They're not really meant to supercharge growth.
NEUT9|So how does this set us up for the rest of the year?
NEUT10|Dana, where we going to be when we talk to you in December?
NEUT11|If we continue to see the reopening and we do see more stimulus come down, where does that leave us?
BEAR12|Well, that means that we're probably going to have much higher growth rates for this year than what people were anticipating before there were strong indications that there was going to be a third round of fiscal supports will also potentially see unemployment fall, maybe even fall below 5% by the end of this year into the upper floors.
NEUT13|But again, you know the Fed is going to be looking at all these factors.
NEUT14|What's driving growth, whether or not inflation is picking up, and how quickly it's picking up and how far it goes above their target.
NEUT15|Now all these factors are going to be important, so I would say you know the messages.
BULL16|Yes, we will see faster growth.
BULL17|We're expecting a booming growth.
BULL18|Certainly starting the mid year when things really open up and also better labor market indications.
NEUT19|But all of that will have to factor into what the feds looking at in terms of.
NEUT20|Easing are not longer easing as much.
NEUT21|It has as it has been.
BULL22|Dana thanks so much for joining us.
BULL23|Good to see.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
