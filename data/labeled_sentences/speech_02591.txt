NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol KODK."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BEAR7|So as of right now, things are looking pretty shaky, although that is a little bit of perspective.
NEUT8|Meaning if you bought anywhere before today will then today is fantastic for you.
NEUT9|However, if you're somebody that bought this morning, you know up around this area of the chart.
BEAR10|Well, this has been a pretty big pullback there, so again, looking shaky, that is totally a comment being made from more.
NEUT11|So the reference point.
NEUT12|People that were very interested this morning during that only 30 minutes and a lot were you look at that opening 30 minute candle.
NEUT13|That's where the vast majority of the volume you know came into play.
NEUT14|And you know the best price people could have gotten during that opening.
NEUT15|30 minutes was right here, so you look at where the price is now all the way down there so you know that all these people, assuming they're still holding, are underwater on their position.
NEUT16|So that's what I mean by looking shaky.
NEUT17|Now, let's talk about some areas of support and resistance.
NEUT18|First area of support.
NEUT19|Well, I'll call down here at that $10 Mark.
NEUT20|And that's basically about 50% of the gap.
NEUT21|Move there an at that level holds, then you know.
NEUT22|Overall again, assuming you care about the bigger picture point of view, that would be nice.
NEUT23|I mean, if the price came down there behave like that and it sort of works way back.
NEUT24|Upwards will then from the big picture point of view, you still have a set of those.
NEUT25|There you have these previous slows down there you envision those stair steps, there you go over all you gotta.
BULL26|Overall nice stairstep progressing in the upward direction.
NEUT27|Now at that level does not quite hold.
BEAR28|Then again, I'm not going to say that that's going to ruin the chart, but that starts to put the price down, kind of in a no man's land.
BEAR29|We want to be shocking and also the price potentially drift back downwards and then close this gap around the.
NEUT30|You know the 8:50 mark, but again, I don't get too far ahead of ourselves, but you know, that is.
NEUT31|Why are the $10 mark is coming from in the event the price tries to bounce.
NEUT32|First key area of resistance than any sort of balance can be right there at $12.25 and then after 12:25 next key level up there right around $13.65.
NEUT33|But the week is young only Monday, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT34|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL37|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT43|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT45|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
