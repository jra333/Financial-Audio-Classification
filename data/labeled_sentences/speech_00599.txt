NEUT0|"""Hello today I'm gonna just quickly show you on tastyworks how to place a cancel replace order so we're going to go in here on the last video I showed you how to place a stop order so we click on the account."
NEUT1|Click on the stock that we're looking at.
NEUT2|You can see we've got an order standing in here it sell at 7395 on the stop.
NEUT3|We're going to go in and edit that click edit.
NEUT4|Let's say we got a trade update and set diet, said to move the stop up to $7075.
NEUT5|So now you brought up the current order and all it's showing is the 7395.
NEUT6|We're going to go in.
NEUT7|We're going to click that that stop limit to change our stop level $75.
NEUT8|Change the stop.
NEUT9|Price and click good till cancelled and that's all there is to it.
NEUT10|Once we've done that and click review to send.
NEUT11|And some changes.
NEUT12|Alright, now we can take a quick look here.
NEUT13|Close that now we can see the orders in here.
NEUT14|Selling 26 at $75.
NEUT15|Current price is 7548 all right now.
NEUT16|Let's say let's say we get in let's say our target price was 7560.
BULL17|We're getting close now.
BEAR18|Work farther and farther away from our stop in theory here, so we're going to just go ahead and cancel this order or edited.
NEUT19|I'm going to place an order not to sell it at 7560, so I'm going to just edit this.
NEUT20|Sell to close, put in a price since the price is above the current price, you can see the current price of 7548.
NEUT21|Ask 7550 Soul Train Bus 7549 right now if you wanted to make the trade right this minute, I'm going to place a order at 7560 to sell.
NEUT22|It won't obviously do anything right now.
NEUT23|It would have to wait until the bid came all the way up and hit 7560.
NEUT24|Let's just $0.12 away.
NEUT25|But anyways, I'm going to place that.
NEUT26|That's all there is to it if I want.
NEUT27|To leave that open order open beyond today I can click good till cancel.
NEUT28|If you can send.
NEUT29|OK, can see selling 26 type limit at 7560 so as long as it hits 7560 I'll sell that stock that I own and click send to change send changes.
NEUT30|And now I can see it saying sold to close 26 shares and 7560.
NEUT31|Alright, that's all there is to it.
NEUT32|Anytime you want to cancel an order, it's just as easy as just cancelling here.
NEUT33|Some people find it easier to cancel the order and then going in place a new order.
NEUT34|Whichever you want to do.
NEUT35|I'm editing and CZ enough, and that's all there is to it.
