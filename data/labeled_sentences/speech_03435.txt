NEUT0|"""This may be this is big news, folks."
NEUT1|I don't know if you saw this just happening.
NEUT2|Crossing the tape.
NEUT3|GameStop announcing that it plans to sell up to 3.5 million shares.
NEUT4|We have been waiting for this moment in many ways and I know a lot of investors were waiting for this moment to happen for a very, very long time.
NEUT5|Given the run up in the stock, which is by the way right now at about $170 a share, a company as we just said, planning to planning to sell as many as 3.5.
NEUT6|Million shares before was at about 190 bucks, but we can do it at a hundred 170 bucks a share.
NEUT7|And you're going to be looking at going to be looking at a sale close to about $600 million.
NEUT8|It's not the $3 billion that some people had expected, and of course what they do with this cash becomes the million or billion dollar question for the future of this company.
NEUT9|Can they make that digital transition?
NEUT10|That's always been the question they didn't sell.
NEUT11|Well, of course, the shares were in the true stratosphere, though I know there.
NEUT12|There are investors who think it's in the stratosphere now and then.
NEUT13|Of course, the big question is, does this pop the bubble?
NEUT14|If you believe there was a bubble here, where does this give investors even more confidence that somehow they can take this cash and move to a new world?
NEUT15|Go from being the blockbuster if you will, to being the Netflix, that of course is the question we're going to watch to see how investors react.
NEUT16|Of course, when Viacom sold sold shares at $85 and we're gonna talk about that story a little bit later to the shares, of course.
BEAR17|Plummeted because there was an investor demand.
NEUT18|We'll see whether there's enough investor demand for this offering guys.
