NEUT0|"""I won't pretend to hide Tesla stock can go afford a billion dollar valuation."
NEUT1|Seems kind of crazy, but so do 300 and send it to her.
NEUT2|But here's what you might be missing.
BULL3|The buyers know that Elon Musk will get tested growing that market cap.
NEUT4|I don't know how they know that.
NEUT5|They just do and they won't be dissuaded.
NEUT6|I've always said test, is it cold stock.
NEUT7|Even tried joining the cult last year that that shareholder base isn't going anywhere and neither am I.
NEUT8|Is that circular reasoning?
NEUT9|Absolutely.
BULL10|It's also giving you a monster gain in this one.
BEAR11|Much of the chagrin of short sellers.
NEUT12|Tesla shareholders genuinely believe.
NEUT13|No one else will ever build a better electric vehicle mass trap.
NEUT14|Their messianic zeal knows no bounds, not even the laws of physics.
NEUT15|Finally, there's the leader, the magnificent 7.
NEUT16|Obviously the Yule Brenner Azum video.
NEUT17|What can I say?
NEUT18|This is their economy, the zoom economy and we just live in it.
NEUT19|This company has insane growth, the likes of which I've never seen.
NEUT20|Total meeting minutes on zoom are 30 times what they were last year.
NEUT21|30 company doesn't even have a low single digit penetration of this market.
NEUT22|It's only just begun to monetize all those users.
NEUT23|Most important, every single time you hear the covid cases are on the rise.
NEUT24|These investors who don't care bout valuation by Zoom hand over fist zooms taking the place of Xerox as a technical verb.
NEUT25|It's the greatest story I've seen since the dawn of the personal computer.
NEUT26|Nothing lasts forever, including the markets love affair with magnificent 7 but the bottom line.
NEUT27|Until we turn the corner in the pandemic, the earnings themselves are simply an abstraction for these theses stocks and any disappointment.
NEUT28|Is simply one more reason.
NEUT29|To buy them.
