NEUT0|"""OK, so David I what is better for your industry?"
NEUT1|A president ultimately like Biden who shares the idea or at least provide his vice president that things should be legalized nationwide or a lot of big states voting in favor of having having legal weed.
BULL2|Well, I think you're on the right point, because what we saw yesterday was momentum.
NEUT3|'cause what we really need is to flip the Senate over to being pro cannabis at some point in time.
NEUT4|And as you continue to win states, especially like some of the States yesterday which are traditionally conservative states, they will ultimately bring their their senator along along with them.
NEUT5|And when we think that that momentum will carry us to federal permissibility in the not too distant future, I thought the same thing.
NEUT6|South Dakota, Montana, Arizona.
NEUT7|I mean, I don't necessarily think of these states.
NEUT8|As states he would say hey, you know what?
NEUT9|Let's send some potheads in here.
NEUT10|Yeah, and and you know, look, I think even a state like New Jersey has ramifications beyond just New Jersey.
NEUT11|Because if you're sitting in the statehouse in in New York, say or in Pennsylvania, you're not going to want your your your residents going over to New Jersey and putting dollars into the tax coffers of New Jersey or creating jobs in New Jersey, right?
NEUT12|So so the more states that that pass, some form of permissibility, I think it just really just build on that momentum, which will ultimately result in.
NEUT13|Pull up federal permissibility.
