NEUT11|Let's put up o'clock.
NEUT12|Let's do this.
NEUT13|Berkshire Hathaway engages in insurance, transportation and utilities, and is of course, run by the famous investor Warren Buffett.
NEUT14|As of this recording, BRK has a market capitalization of $523 billion in a price per share, around $211.00 to own or not to own.
NEUT15|That is the question.
NEUT16|Here's some reasons you might want to own, Berkshire.
NEUT17|Let's start with the metrics for the most recent quarter.
BULL18|Q 2018 revenue rose by 8.6% over the same quarter last year.
BULL19|Berkshire Hathaway's Q2 revenue of $62.2 billion also beat analyst consensus by 200.
BULL20|$61 million operating earnings rose by 67% from 4,000,000 to about 7 billion year over year Q 2018.
BULL21|Net earnings distributable for B class shareholders was $4.87, up from $1.73 over the same quarter last year.
BULL22|In addition to these metrics, for sure, Hathaway sitting on an enormous pile of cash of $106 billion this month, Berkshires Board of Directors gave more flexibility to Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, saying share buybacks could happen if the couple could agree that they will repurchase shares at a market price below Berkshires intrinsic value.
BULL23|This means share buybacks are more likely in the long term future, ultimately returning.
NEUT24|More of the money to shareholders, but here are some reasons to not own Berkshire.
BULL25|After these Q 2018 earnings share buybacks seem unlikely in the short term future, since the company reported great results.
NEUT26|But the biggest concern going forward is probably with Buffett himself.
BULL27|Although Berkshire Hathaway is still showing market beating performance, we don't know how long that will last.
BULL28|With Warren Buffett being 87 years old, Buffett is assured that passing the torch to Ted Weschler and Todd Combs is one of the best moves Berkshire Hathaway will ever make.
NEUT29|But handling the Founders retirement is never easy for investors.
NEUT30|The new management's vision may not align with the founders.
NEUT31|So what do you say?
NEUT32|Bye or no?
BULL33|Can Berkshire Hathaway continue to outperform the market at the rate it has even after Buffett is gone?
