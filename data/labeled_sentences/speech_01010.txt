NEUT0|"""To wrap up the show, let's take a look at Walmart."
BULL1|It looks like shares of the company up about 1.3% to almost 150 bucks share.
NEUT2|They've been starting off 2021 pretty hot with some new products and like other grocers, they're making an aggressive push into delivery and we have more on exactly how they're doing that with Yahoo Finance's, Julia La Roche Julia tell us more about how they're hoping to streamline the process of getting a fresh produce and groceries to your to your house.
NEUT3|Well, that's right, Brian.
NEUT4|When you look at Walmart they didn't launch their delivery offering.
NEUT5|In addition to that online grocery pickup?
BULL6|Back in 2018 and this is a service that has been doing record volumes as of the last or the most recent earnings quarter for Walmart and now in their hometown of Bentonville, AR.
NEUT7|Participating customers can pilot a new service this spring in partnership with home valet.
NEUT8|What is Home Valley?
NEUT9|They offer these smart boxes.
NEUT10|These Internet of Things powered smart boxes that have temperature temperature controls.
NEUT11|There are three different temperature controls for your frozen items.
NEUT12|Your refrigerated goods and also your pantry items.
NEUT13|And these smart boxes will communicate with those delivery associates devices, allowing them to drop off these grocery orders.
NEUT14|So the person who owns the residence they don't have to be home.
BULL15|So this actually puts Walmart one step closer to 24/7 a grocery delivery.
NEUT16|Now I'll point out that Tom Ward, the SBP of product he wrote a blog post, he said.
NEUT17|For Walmart, it presents an opportunity to deliver items 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
BULL18|While we don't have plans to 24/7 delivery today, it certainly has a nice.
NEUT19|Ring to it so it's something to keep an eye on.
NEUT20|I really kind of changes the game so you don't have to be home any longer for those orders, Brian.
NEUT21|And then, Secondly, apparently yesterday Walmart had a press release saying they're also going to work with creating a fintech alongside startup Rib.
NEUT22|It's actually the VC firm behind Robin Hood, but they were very vague.
BULL23|It said quote tech driven financial experiences.
NEUT24|What does that even mean?
NEUT25|OK, well it's really interesting because Walmart actually already operates financial services product, so I suppose that partnering here with RBC Capital the VC firm behind Robin Hood.
NEUT26|As you just mentioned, credit Karma and affirm and some other companies think about Walmart.
NEUT27|They are the nation's largest employer.
NEUT28|They employ more than a million associates, so building digital financial products for their employees.
NEUT29|But also they have millions of customers here in the US and around the world.
NEUT30|They go into their stores, use the Walmart ecosystem, the online.
NEUT31|So I think here the.
NEUT32|Growth plan is not only build products test and innovate.
NEUT33|I suppose they have something in mind here but also acquire fintech companies.
NEUT34|And as you're mentioning, it's pretty vague, they, the company has yet to be named.
NEUT35|They're looking to hire A management team.
NEUT36|They're looking for a CEO, so another interesting space, Walmart, now the gate 2020 and a lot of innovation is something to watch, Ryan.
BULL37|"Alright, Julie Larose, thank you so much."""
