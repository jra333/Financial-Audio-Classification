NEUT0|"""It's quite short and this will be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the daily timeframe real quick.
NEUT2|For disclosures sake I do own shares of Apple in my retirement accounts.
NEUT3|Now I've done this one quite a few times before, but it's been awhile.
BEAR4|Obviously a lot of questions requests came on it today, given they had earnings last night and big volume the gap down and all that.
NEUT5|But ultimately when all the dust had settled, you know again from the big picture perspective and that's the perspective I'm talking about.
NEUT6|So if you are a day trader and you bought right there and your goal was, you know you're going to sell on some sort of upward price movement today, then yeah, for you the charts looking kind of rough, but for the big picture perspective, All in all, the charts hanging in there.
NEUT7|Not the best day in and of itself, but when you look at multiple days you can see that.
BULL8|You know the price is still got plenty of opportunity to build a higher base and continue on with this uptrend that's been established ever since.
NEUT9|It was that late June when it bottomed out here and then.
NEUT10|From that point time you can see the prices just kind of slowly and methodically been moving upward.
NEUT11|So what I want to do is just map out a couple areas of support and the one that I was watching very closely today.
NEUT12|And you didn't even get close to being tested and that was this level down here at one 11:50 to me.
BULL13|That level is very important because during the previous consolidation after the price made the big move up.
NEUT14|And then when the Bears try to press it down, bears tried multiple times to press down through that level.
NEUT15|But each and every time the bull said no, that's not going to happen.
NEUT16|And like I said today, Price didn't even go down there and test that.
NEUT17|And you know, it's really as far as I'm concerned.
BULL18|If the price can continue to hold up above a one 1150 going forward, that's just a good healthy consolidation from again, the big picture perspective.
NEUT19|Now in the event 111 cannot hold.
NEUT20|And the next level of support that I'd keep a close eye on, in my opinion at least, is about 108.
NEUT21|Eighty 108, fifty whatever you want to call it any sort of closes below 108.
NEUT22|Eighty.
BEAR23|At that point it would not shock me at all to see the price rollover an potentially even go down and retest the 200 day simple moving average, but I don't want to get too far ahead of myself, 'cause as it stands right now.
NEUT24|Like I said, one 11:50 that level right there wasn't even tested today.
BULL25|You also have the purple line right there, the 50 day someone average, which is making some progress upwards.
NEUT26|So if that levels tested, then yes, certainly you would want to see that act as support so.
BULL27|You know, given you know the circumstances of today, I was overall, please just because you know that level of support, not even tested now very well may be tested over the next couple of days.
NEUT28|But you know, after the earnings and all the dust had settled, not only was it not tested, but as already pointed out, price actually bounced back upwards and you know had a decent little candle there in regards to levels of resistance, you know nothing really new to report there.
BEAR29|You know the prices just been struggling up around that area, which sits at about 1:18.
NEUT30|Fifty so short term 118.
NEUT31|Fifty is that the current level of resistance?
NEUT32|But in my opinion.
NEUT33|Top priority right now is not breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT34|Top priority is just building a higher base.
BULL35|Going through a healthy consolidation.
BULL36|Granted, it's only been one day, but so far so good.
NEUT37|One of the most popular questions I get is a clay.
NEUT38|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT39|So what I've done is put together this free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT40|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, liberal means click right there to get access to the guide.
NEUT41|The guide itself is very short and to the point, and like I say it is free.
BULL42|Thanks for watching.
NEUT43|"Have a good one."""
