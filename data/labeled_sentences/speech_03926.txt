NEUT0|"""Hey friend, solution here with the Bullish Bears team, this video is going to be about how to link charts an windows within the Lightspeed Trader platform."
NEUT1|It's very simple to do so.
NEUT2|Basically you want to see here on this level 2.
NEUT3|Ideally with this setup.
NEUT4|Here you want to have all my your charts link to this level 2, or if that's your preference, I'm going to show you a couple different ways to do it so the way to do it you'll see right here.
NEUT5|There's a link when you right click on this Gray bar and the chart you'll see link.
NEUT6|And you'll see a level 2 over here, so right now you'll see it's grayed out, which means it's connected currently to that level 2.
NEUT7|So let's just say I was to add another chart.
NEUT8|So let's just for the heck of it.
NEUT9|Just move these charts over an let's say I want to write or just click here on new chart and it pops up a new chart over here, right?
NEUT10|So let's say I wanted to have this chart linked to this level 2.
NEUT11|When I right click here on that Gray bar area, you'll see Link.
NEUT12|And now that window is open right here so I can click on it.
NEUT13|So this right here you'll see quote window be AC.
NEUT14|Well you'll see right down over here the Level 2 is BAC.
NEUT15|So this is where I will click on BACO.
NEUT16|Now when I right click on the grey area and link you'll see my chart is currently linked to this level 2.
NEUT17|So now let's go up over here and do new level 2 right?
NEUT18|So now we have a new level 2 quote window that we can put down over in here.
NEUT19|An we will type in a new symbol.
NEUT20|Let's do Apple.
NEUT21|Alright, so now we have a new level 2 window over here with Apple and you'll see these yellow lines when you see the yellow around it.
NEUT22|This is the currently active Level 2.
NEUT23|CLC, these charts right here are not linked to Apple.
NEUT24|They're linked to be AC.
NEUT25|So when I go back over to be AC, you'll see these are the charts you'll see.
NEUT26|The yellow is over here, so that means my charts over here are linked.
NEUT27|So let's say I want to link this chart above to Apple below I just right click on this Gray area, click on link, and now you'll see Quote Window Ale O.
NEUT28|Now you'll see right here.
NEUT29|This chart above is linked to this level 2.
NEUT30|If I wanted to go and put it back over to be AC, I'd right click click on link and then go over to BSA Zero again.
NEUT31|Just show you here.
NEUT32|Let's say I wanted to link this window over here for some reason.
NEUT33|Right click click on link.
NEUT34|I can link link it to LCL below right here I click here and there it is ale over here.
NEUT35|So this is where you can kind of set up.
NEUT36|Different montage is depending on how you like it.
NEUT37|Have several different level twos.
NEUT38|And then link the particular chart that you want to link to the particular level 2.
NEUT39|So it's as simple as again click on the right, right click on the grey area, click on link and then choose the particular level 2 area.
NEUT40|That's how easy it is to link charts in Windows.
BULL41|Within the Lightspeed Trader platform, so hopefully this video helped you and we will see you in our community.
NEUT42|"Enjoy."""
