BULL0|"""Welcome back to Yahoo Finance."
NEUT1|Live workers at Alphabet, the parent company of Google are joining a union to actually implement change in the workplace to deal with issues like their salaries, pay and workplace transparency.
NEUT2|Now over 200 workers have already joined the Union.
NEUT3|Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's editor in Chief Andy Souwer.
NEUT4|To break this down, Andy is 2021 going to be the year that tech faces reckoning.
NEUT5|I mean on all manner of fronts.
NEUT6|Abeel right?
NEUT7|It's.
NEUT8|Question will be asking about section 2:30 but sticking just with this Union question, which I think is a very, very interesting story.
NEUT9|The number of employees at Google as you said, have formed a union of with the Communication Workers of America, which is a is a big National Union and it's only about 1/10 of 1% of the nearly quarter million employees that Google has a bill, but.
NEUT10|They're forming what's known as a minority union, and that means that instead of actually negotiating a whole contract and getting authorized by the National Labor Relations Board, this is a sort of it's sort of a symbolic union, really, where they're going to be formalizing the structure so they can talk to management about issues not so much pay, but things like diversity inclusion, whether or not the company should continue to work with DoD, for instance.
NEUT11|Immigration policy, but it is an important first step in Silicon Valley, which has been a place where unions have made very, very few inroads.
NEUT12|Andy, let's switch to section 230.
NEUT13|There was an incredible report last night on 60 minutes about people who've been harmed by trolls on the Internet, but there's also the bite administration, which seems to want to repeal 2:30.
NEUT14|Where do we stand with all that?
NEUT15|Yeah, this is going to be probably the biggest issue for investors in tech to be monitoring right now.
NEUT16|Adam as we kind of get out of the gate here with the body administration because there is appetite on both sides of the aisle.
NEUT17|Republicans and Democrats to attack this issue.
NEUT18|We know that President Trump was, you know, really pounding the table about this.
NEUT19|Tried to wrap it up with the Defense bill.
NEUT20|Probably not the best way to go about doing this, but Democrats want to see this too because it's an instance here.
NEUT21|An issue where.
NEUT22|The tech companies are basically self regulating and it's not working.
BEAR23|It's harming our society in terms of elections and these individuals that 60 minutes piece that you're referring to.
BEAR24|Last night Adam was pretty devastating innocent people just being put in harm's way and not having any recourse.
NEUT25|Not being able to Sue YouTube, Facebook or Twitter, getting rid of Section 230 would allow that to happen.
BULL26|I think it's going to be a big mountain to climb now.
NEUT27|Fighting against this Facebook has a pretty strong campaign out there saying oh we want to be regulated.
NEUT28|Change the regulation.
NEUT29|Well, that's basically saying but don't get rid of Section 230, which gives them this blanket coverage.
BULL30|Well, definitely interesting to see in 2021 if they're able to maintain those liability protections.
BULL31|Andy, Sir, thanks so much.
NEUT32|"Next"""
