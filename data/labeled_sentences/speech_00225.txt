NEUT7|Talking about the election and talking about a deal in South Korea, this deal appears to be even bigger in some future way because it's 5050.
NEUT8|Why Renault and how big do you think that European market just might be?
NEUT9|So bright thank you for having me on an Wivern owes an easy answer were no is the second largest Lake commercial vehicle company in Europe.
NEUT10|And they also were experts in battery electric vehicles, which is a critical technology when you marry it with fuel cells.
NEUT11|And when you look at those two together, it's a perfect marriage since we provide a full turnkey from the fuel cell to the hydrogen infrastructure to hydrogen and in Europe they expect by the year 2030 there to be over 500,000 fuel cell electric vehicles, local light commercial vehicles on the road and this JB is targeting 1/3 of that.
BULL12|And I agree this could be bigger than the South Korea activity and plug is.
