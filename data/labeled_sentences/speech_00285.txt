NEUT0|"""Welcome back to let's get buy or sell best of Brown Harris Stevens over 2500 agents at that firm and she joins us now so you really have your finger on the pulse of what's happening, especially in New York."
NEUT1|So let's start with this bidding war idea that we keep reading about and hearing.
NEUT2|There are bidding wars it.
NEUT3|What properties are you seeing the most demand for right now?
NEUT4|Are we talking about specifically in New York City?
NEUT5|Yeah, either New York City or the suburbs.
NEUT6|Like any in your wheelhouse, what you guys are seeing?
NEUT7|Where are you seeing the most people come in an all be wanting the same property, so other regions?
NEUT8|I'll just tell you where there are multiple bids and there's undersupply would be places like Palm Beach, Connecticut, the Hamptons.
NEUT9|Those areas are.
NEUT10|There's just not enough product and there's multiple bids happening in all those regions here in New York City, because we just opened up to be able to show.
NEUT11|Starting this week, we're just in phase two.
NEUT12|It's hard to say, although you know the agents that I've been speaking to have been telling me that the the sweet spot is the $1,000,000 you know around $1,000,000, one to two people are bidding and interested, but they're telling me that the over $3 million market has been very quiet.
NEUT13|OK, so let's talk about New York in the quiet parts because everybody wants a deal and a bunch of us live in New York.
BEAR14|So are prices going down?
NEUT15|Are there any screaming deals in New York City right now?
NEUT16|Well, I did not.
NEUT17|When are they coming?
NEUT18|Yeah, good question.
BEAR19|Well, I think remember prior to this pandemic, we were already in a price correction in the market was correcting and we were very fluid in doing business.
NEUT20|Then the pandemic hit.
NEUT21|So I would say this is a huge opportunity market.
BULL22|For all buyers who are interested, and I think for new developments, they can find incredible deals an I think that rates are really good.
NEUT23|So I think the prices are continuing to correct and that sellers have to be realistic and let go of prepandemic pricing and and understand that we're kind of in a new arena.
NEUT24|And then best thinking about that, does it seem to you like the next 18 months, maybe even more challenging than right now?
BEAR25|Because we're also in a recession.
NEUT26|So we had this weird housing.
NEUT27|But I don't think the prospects for the economy are necessarily rosy.
NEUT28|Looking out over the last couple of years.
BEAR29|And as you mentioned, the New York City market specifically had already been in a kind of a tough spot.
BULL30|Yeah, I mean, you, you make a really great point.
BEAR31|I think we are really concerned because, you know, we've all we've been facing these headwinds regarding taxes.
NEUT32|Anyway, the cap on the salt deduction.
NEUT33|We have them.
NEUT34|Pension tax and then all these you know in Albany there's all this legislation pending like a pied a Terre tax.
BEAR35|So a lot of New Yorkers have packed up and left.
NEUT36|They have moved to Florida or different.
NEUT37|You know States and that's been an issue now the pandemic.
NEUT38|So vertical living offers and other challenges.
NEUT39|And then, as you mentioned, unemployment, the economy and it's also an election year.
NEUT40|So all of those things that you just pointed out to me, yes I am concerned about the market.
BULL41|I I'm very I know New York is very resilient.
NEUT42|But I'm also realistic and I think that the market will be.
