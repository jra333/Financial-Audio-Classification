NEUT0|"""Can you give all of us the Peter Lynch two minute monologue explaining the business of Berkshire Berkshire Hathaway an its merits as a long time investment for future decades, we've always tried to say to stay sane and other people a lot of them like to go crazy."
BULL1|That's a competitive advantage.
NEUT2|Number.
NEUT3|#2 as we've gotten bigger, we've used this sort of Golden rule that we want to treat the subsidiaries the way we would want to be treated if we were in the subsidiaries.
NEUT4|And that again is a very rare attitude in corporate America, and it causes.
NEUT5|People that come to us who don't want to come.
NEUT6|Anybody else?
BULL7|That is a long term competitive advantage.
NEUT8|A few years ago a person who's in this audience, I believe, came to me.
NEUT9|And it was.
NEUT10|In his 60s.
NEUT11|And he said that.
NEUT12|For about a year he's been thinking about selling his business, and the reason he's been thinking about it.
NEUT13|Was not because he wanted to retire, and we're not we.
NEUT14|We very seldom buy business from people who want to retire, didn't marry tired.
NEUT15|All I would love what he was doing.
NEUT16|But he had an experience in buying a business.
NEUT17|A few years earlier.
NEUT18|From a family where he had known the fellow would build it, Sullivan died and then just everything bad started happening in the family in the business and the employees everything else.
NEUT19|So he he really wanted to put to bed the question.
NEUT20|Of what happened with his business.
NEUT21|It wasn't really cared a lot about monetizing it or having the money he just wanted.
NEUT22|He wanted to put his mind at ease, that what he'd spent lovingly building up over 30 or 40 years was not going to get.
NEUT23|Get destroyed.
BEAR24|Or that his family would get destroyed.
NEUT25|At the if you made a.
NEUT26|If he died.
NEUT27|So he said he thought about it a year.
NEUT28|And he thought about it, and he thought, well, if I sell it.
NEUT29|To one of my competitors and they would be a logical buyer.
NEUT30|They usually are.
NEUT31|That's why we have antitrust laws.
NEUT32|If you sold it to a competitor, they would come in and basically they would.
NEUT33|They would put their people in charge.
NEUT34|They would have all these ideas about synergy.
NEUT35|And synergy would mean that the people that had helped him build the business over 30 years.
BEAR36|Would all get sacked and that the the acquiring company would come in like Attila behind and be the conquering people and and and he just didn't want to do that to the people that helped him over the years.
NEUT37|And then he thought he could say he might sell it to some.
NEUT38|Private equity firm and they figured that if he sold them, they loaded up with debt, which she didn't like, and then they resell it later on, and so he would again in loss control.
NEUT39|They might do the same thing that he didn't want to have happened in the first place in terms of selling it to competitor or whatever it might be.
NEUT40|So when he came to me, he said.
NEUT41|He described this.
NEUT42|And he said.
NEUT43|It really isn't because you're so attractive, but he said you're the only guy left standing, you know.
NEUT44|I mean, yeah, you're not.
NEUT45|You're not a competitor, you're not a a private equity firm man.
BULL46|And I know I will get a permanent home with Berkshire.
BULL47|"And that the people that have stayed with me over the years will continue to get opportunities and and they will continue to work for me and I'll get to keep doing what I love doing and I won't have to worry about what will happen if something happens to me tonight."""
