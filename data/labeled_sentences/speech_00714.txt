NEUT0|"""Also, guys back in the day it is your boy will today."
NEUT1|I'll be talking about Tesla.
NEUT2|Took a simple TSLA and give you guys some key support levels that I see.
NEUT3|I'll make this one this video a little short 'cause it's not too many levels.
NEUT4|I really only have two main levels that I'm looking at.
NEUT5|I'm not playing Tesla yet as you guys know I don't like trading in this.
BEAR6|'cause if you get options this will just chop you up and you will start losing on your option.
NEUT7|'cause it.
NEUT8|Data later will kill you daters just time decay and all this right here.
NEUT9|Would just kill your options when you play options you want to be in this movement to make money.
NEUT10|You don't want to be in this OK, but if you're in shares and you really can just hold 'cause Tesla is a good stock to long term.
NEUT11|So make sure you guys like the video subscribe, turn on post notifications and check out my Patreon page down below if you guys want to know what I'm buying and selling stocks.
NEUT12|So my first support is right here at eight 2981, it has been holding this.
NEUT13|Very well, so I'm not short term bullish, but I'm neutral.
NEUT14|OK, neutral means I'm just.
NEUT15|I'm just looking at the stock for it to tell me which one I should be OK.
NEUT16|If it starts breaking out above like 870, then I think we might be able to see higher highs, but if it breaks below this and I don't see any support until down here at 774 now when it comes.
NEUT17|If it does come down here, if it breaks this and comes down to 74, this is the area I'm looking to buy.
NEUT18|OK and I will send that alert on my Patreon page.
NEUT19|But this is the area I'm looking to buy as you guys know, I only like playing plays that are 70% in a higher right.
NEUT20|I don't like gambling.
NEUT21|I like to know.
NEUT22|Set my probability is 70% higher when I get in place right?
NEUT23|So if it breaks this then I turned bearish short term longer term.
NEUT24|I'm always bullish on Tesla, but if it breaks this I turn bearish short term.
NEUT25|But if it breaks us 870 mark I say then I will turn short term bullish and I'll probably look for some call options to get in when you're making new highs for that 900 big figure and ultimately $1000 a big figure which is crazy 'cause I did.
NEUT26|They just had a stock split and they're already going back up.
BEAR27|Over $1000, but I feel like they will do another stock split 'cause their price is very high and whenever they do stock splits their prices lower so more people get in 'cause most people feel like they can get shares at this high price.
NEUT28|So I feel like that might come in the future, but we never know.
NEUT29|So just had this level eight 2981 and this level at 774.
NEUT30|These are key levels.
NEUT31|If it breaks us short term bearish but if it breaks at 870 mark then I'll be short term bullish.
NEUT32|OK so that's why I'm playing Tesla.
BULL33|Hope you guys like the video.
NEUT34|Remember just noticed Recommendation Bar so anything.
NEUT35|"Educational purposes only, so do not trade anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in next month by."""
