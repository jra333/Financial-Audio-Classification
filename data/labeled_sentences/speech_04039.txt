NEUT0|"""How's it going guys?"
BULL1|So today we're going to be talking about I bio and why their first pharmaceutical company can mass produce these COVID-19 drugs quicker than anyone in the US, which is honestly sending their stocks soaring today.
NEUT2|So this is definitely buy in.
NEUT3|But before we get into that.
NEUT4|Definitely like the video and subscribe turn on post notifications 'cause I post every single day.
NEUT5|So let's get into it.
NEUT6|As you can see I bio so 11% and the reason for that is because they basically have been mass producing this possible COVID-19 vaccine.
NEUT7|They have about 5,000,000 doses and they are one of the only fast pharmaceutical companies in the United States that can do this.
NEUT8|And they announced that it will be collaborating with.
NEUT9|Infectious disease research.
NEUT10|So for clinical trials, etc.
NEUT11|So they're mass producing all of the COVID-19 vaccines that can be possibly used, and then when they have a definite vaccine, they can mass produce that as well, so that gives him leverage in the United States at least.
NEUT12|So while they're ripping up, definitely get in while you can because you don't not want to miss this opportunity to buy in they.
NEUT13|Have been basically uninstall Pilcher in the past week and the past month, so definitely check them out before you miss out.
