NEUT0|"""If you are someone who does come into let's say add inheritance or you do when a significant chunk of money."
NEUT1|A smart way to play it.
NEUT2|Well, I mean.
NEUT3|Obviously, to make money there's always some type of risk involved, but just like historically, over time the stock market is the best vehicle to build wealth over time you know you look at, you know, some of the richest people on this planet.
NEUT4|Warren Buffett comes to mind.
NEUT5|Where where do you get his money from?
NEUT6|You know he's always been investing and always investing into the stock market and you know, and I think that's probably you know.
NEUT7|Obviously if you don't have any.
NEUT8|Money in that.
NEUT9|Yet I think that's probably the very first place.
NEUT10|I personally you know would look because when you're in the stock market you you own something.
NEUT11|So if I buy Starbucks I buy Amazon like I own Starbucks.
NEUT12|I own Amazon, you know, and I don't know, but I don't envision companies like that going anywhere.
NEUT13|I imagine Starbucks will be here for a very long time.
NEUT14|Amazons of the world will be here for a very long time.
NEUT15|So if you put it into companies that are having kind of established themselves, they're not going anywhere.
NEUT16|Overtime you should do well got it and how about I didn't hear you say anything about real estate, which is a very growing popular.
NEUT17|Asset that people want to learn how to do.
NEUT18|Real estate investing and but you said stock market is the best place and a lot of times I've heard real estate is by far the best thing.
NEUT19|Where, where?
NEUT20|How does that compare in your mind?
BEAR21|The stock market is going to be way more liquid so the idea is that if something goes wrong, if there's a problem with the investments or the economy moves into kind of into kind of a recession.
NEUT22|If I don't want the stocks that I bought, I can get rid of him right away.
NEUT23|Right now, if I go and I put that money into real estate instead.
NEUT24|Real estate operates in bubbles to the financial crisis or the housing crisis of 2008, 2009.
NEUT25|I mean, that's.
NEUT26|That wasn't just a, this will only happen one time and it will never happen again.
BEAR27|You know real estate prices are at again historic highs levels that we haven't seen since 2008, 2009, and that's being fueled by a very, very low interest rate environment.
NEUT28|Now the problem with people kind of just putting money into this right now is that if we start creeping and raising interest rates.
NEUT29|Real estate prices go down as interest rates go up, so you know kind of purchasing homes for like, fix and flip.
NEUT30|You know type thing with a little television shows and things like that.
NEUT31|While real estate is a great and knocking real estate and I just I just feel the stock market is a safer place.
BULL32|"Interest money because of the liquidity problem during during hard times yes got it OK."""
