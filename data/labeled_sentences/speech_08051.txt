NEUT0|"""Everybody, so I know it's been awhile since we've uploaded a video talking about a different stock, so I've been waiting quite some time for Facebook, but let's go ahead and let's talk about this and I've in quick suggestion."
NEUT1|Go ahead and see what I'm seeing in place to trade out this week.
NEUT2|So if you're looking at this trade, you probably have no idea what's going on.
NEUT3|It looks like nonsense to you.
NEUT4|Even if we took off ichimoku, this would still look like nonsense.
NEUT5|You wouldn't have any idea what's going on.
NEUT6|Now.
NEUT7|I'm not necessarily looking at the day or the week or the monthly, but you can see how clear the chart gets when we go ahead and go up.
NEUT8|Now the last time prices came down to this moving average was back in April and I remember when Facebook had less privacy things that was going on.
BEAR9|Sucker Burg Facebook stock pulled back pretty significantly like 10% pullback on this and Facebook right now is pulled back to the same level and you can already see it's already going to be exhausted.
BEAR10|The wicking has already occurred.
NEUT11|I don't think it's going to go much lower.
NEUT12|I do not see it dropping all the way down to this.
NEUT13|Or turn $20 per share.
NEUT14|So I'll be looking to buy Facebook right when market opens.
BEAR15|Probably have a stop loss.
NEUT16|About $1015 per share beneath my entry.
NEUT17|"They might take profit can either be altered to 18 or I can have an infinite take profit."""
