NEUT0|"""Jump for table to join us as well."
NEUT1|Jaune nice numbers but no doubt you're more keen to reflect on this pretty significant news on a change of CEO.
NEUT2|Yeah, Andy Jassy that's that's big news.
NEUT3|Andy Jassy, of course, has been at Amazon for nearly 25 years and he founded Amazon Web Services.
NEUT4|In 2003, and you know, I've talked to him many times about the fan founding story of a WS about his relationship with Jeff Bezos.
NEUT5|I think it's interesting that just a few months ago, the head of Amazon's consumer unit, which is you know, the more traditional Amazon.com part of the business he stepped down.
NEUT6|Now Andy Jassy being elevated to this position.
NEUT7|It goes to show just how important.
NEUT8|This cloud business has become to Amazon overall, and of course it was born out of the core needs of Amazon's e-commerce business and they thought that boy they could use this same infrastructure and the same flexibility that they needed to change the game for enterprise software and enterprise infrastructure in general.
NEUT9|And now that's expanded in so many different directions there, innovating in hardware there really driving a lot of what's happening, not just in enterprise, but even in the chips business.
BEAR10|So you know this move from Amazon is interesting, and Andy Jassy has perhaps in some ways been an underappreciated figure in technology over the last 20 years.
BULL11|But he he has been pretty well appreciated, it will say.
BULL12|Yeah, it's certainly appreciated by his boss becoming CEO.
BULL13|I just want to highlight that we're keeping track of all the after hours movers for you alphabets up 7% right now on a big earnings beat.
BEAR14|Chipotle's flat, an Electronic Arts, is down 5%.
NEUT15|You can see them all on the side of the screens on the market zone, but John will stick with the big news here and that is Jeff Bezos handing the reins to Andy Jassy.
NEUT16|Thanks for giving us a little tutorial on who Andy Jassy is.
NEUT17|Are you surprised the shares of Amazon?
BEAR18|It was a huge quarter.
NEUT19|Are up a little bit, but this is a stock.
NEUT20|I mean, we have to talk about Jeff Bezos and what Amazon looks like without Jeff Bezos, who is the founder, right?
NEUT21|Famously started in his garage.
NEUT22|Had the vision that a lot of people on Wall Street did not see, and then they did, and they rode that wave.
BULL23|It was a tremendous one becoming not just the most important online e-commerce retailer, buyer of Whole Foods, and now major cloud player, John.
NEUT24|What does this company look like without Bezos running it?
NEUT25|I want to hear more about exactly what Bezos is going to do.
NEUT26|You know, he's stepping down from the role as CEO.
NEUT27|I'd be shocked if he steps away from Amazon entirely.
NEUT28|I just don't believe he's capable of that.
NEUT29|I so more detail.
NEUT30|I want to hear, but I keep in mind Larry Ellison hasn't been the CEO.
