NEUT0|"""So what will be the best bet for investors in 2013 taking us through their individual visions?"
NEUT1|David Dahl from his CEO of Sequent Asset Management.
NEUT2|Peter Schiff, the CEO of Euro Pacific Capital and our own senior economics Reporter Steve Leisman.
NEUT3|Join us with their predictions here, David.
NEUT4|Start with you.
NEUT5|What are you looking at?
NEUT6|Especially?
BEAR7|I mean, bear in mind we're going to be still feeling the effects of the fiscal Cliff.
NEUT8|And technically we're going over it tonight.
NEUT9|Does this affect your thoughts about investing in 2013?
BEAR10|Absolutely it does Bill, and it has the last two months we've seen a marked retreat from US based investments after US centric Holdings.
BULL11|The S&P 500 S and P-100 showing strong leadership in the first ten months of the year.
BEAR12|What we've really seen is now foreign markets picking up the slack as investors have voted with their feet.
NEUT13|So I would say that when we look into 2013, the opportunities most likely exist outside the United States, not here in the US.
NEUT14|David, outside of the United States is a very large geographic area.
NEUT15|Can you narrow it down for us like?
NEUT16|Asia, Europe Africa emerging frontier.
NEUT17|What is it?
NEUT18|Yeah, of course Mandy, and that's part of the asset selection that you have to do for us.
NEUT19|One of the best areas we've seen is been an emerging market debt.
NEUT20|You know, it started out many years ago with the bricks and recently we've moved in the last five or six years to the N 11 by looking at those emerging markets where we can have sovereign debt, maybe moving even towards corporate debt and relying on a manager.
NEUT21|A good fund like the Fidelity Advisor Emerging Market Fund.
NEUT22|That's where opportunities exist, Peter, I'm I'm really interested in what is going to be the key driver of the markets overall.
NEUT23|I mean, I'm kind of sick of politics being the driver, right?
NEUT24|Because it means that we're not.
NEUT25|We're not really being driven by fundamentals are being driven by by bickering out of Washington with being driven by headlines every other hour.
NEUT26|What will drive the markets in 2013?
NEUT27|And will it be justified?
NEUT28|Well, if people understood the fundamentals, it would be a whole different story.
NEUT29|I think the fact that so many people are still confused about what the fundamentals really are.
NEUT30|We're in.
BEAR31|We're in some terrible shape here in the United States and I think the message that we are sending the world with respect to the negotiations to avoid the fiscal Cliff is that we are never going to address the fundamental problem.
NEUT32|We're not going to stop the spending.
NEUT33|We're not going to stop the debts the Fed is going to keep on monetizing the debts until we have a currency crisis.
NEUT34|That's the bottom line.
BEAR35|We're going to have to be forced to act responsibly.
BEAR36|And if the dollar is going to come down, I think it could come down a lot in 2013 then that's another headwind or tailwind.
NEUT37|Rather for investing abroad.
BULL38|And I agree with your guest.
NEUT39|I like bodies emerging markets.
BULL40|I like the action, particularly in the last couple of months and a lot of the Southeast Asian markets we've been investing in places like Indonesia down in Mexico.
NEUT41|Some of the more exotic locations.
BULL42|But you gotta get out of U.S. dollars and I'm surprised Golden do better in 2012.
NEUT43|Why would you invest in the country whose terms of trades are?
BEAR44|Are getting worse rather than in the country United States with appreciating dollar where the terms of trade are improving.
BEAR45|Well that a weakening dollar doesn't improve your terms of trade.
NEUT46|What that does is it makes it more expensive exactly when it does.
NEUT47|No, it doesn't fix the dollar.
BEAR48|Steve, the dollar has been depreciate ING copper decades and looking at our trade deficit and appreciating for decades, it's been up awhile.
NEUT49|Yes, it has where you best.
NEUT50|Not just stay here.
NEUT51|Do you see?
NEUT52|Do you see it?
NEUT53|Appreciate significant depreciation of the Euro.
BULL54|Significant appreciation.
NEUT55|I think what's really interesting is what we've learned.
NEUT56|"Is that it?"""
