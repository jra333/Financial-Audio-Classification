NEUT0|"""Hey guys this is andrewreturnsensors.com so I've been working as a professional trader for the past six years in Hong Kong."
NEUT1|An right now gas.
NEUT2|I'm doing YouTube videos because I want to show you guys how protesters actually working.
NEUT3|What kind of tools and techniques we use and most importantly how to use them.
NEUT4|So if you guys want to know about all this stuff and if you want to know about how we actually make money on the markets as pro trailers you are in the right place.
NEUT5|So today I want to talk about football TV.
NEUT6|Let's get into it.
NEUT7|So I can see that there is a lot of interest in the stock 'cause another few actually asking me stuff in the comments and stuff like this.
NEUT8|I know that probably you guys bought it too high and you're wondering what is the right thing to do.
NEUT9|Should you buy this deep or not?
NEUT10|So the answer is yes, but where should you buy it?
NEUT11|Not at 28.
NEUT12|Not definitely at 24 here.
NEUT13|So basically the breakout we are in this situation will be different because the must have the videos I do have here.
NEUT14|This kind of trend line but football, you know broke it and never actually restarted.
NEUT15|So actually the trendline we have in here that is the most strongest one is at 23.
NEUT16|So we have retested it once an for now we're not retesting it.
NEUT17|But guys, this is the level.
NEUT18|So I'm not saying we gonna go there for sure.
NEUT19|I'm just saying that you know this is if you along don't buy more at 2829 thirty.
NEUT20|You need to wait a bit longer to be a bit more so an we have here the 200.
NEUT21|Moving average at this coming an my scenario guys.
NEUT22|So you see, I'm mostly bullish on everything but doesn't mean I'm bullish at any level.
NEUT23|I would read something like this all right?
NEUT24|So maybe here visually it looks good on the 30th of April, so I guess we have time.
NEUT25|Alright, we're not in a rush.
NEUT26|We have some doing this video on the 10th of March.
NEUT27|Guys, maybe you know I'm posting it a bit later.
NEUT28|The reason is that you know I'm still working as a trader to work everyday and I take some days off to do my videos so I mostly do all the videos the same day and then I publish it daily on my YouTube channel.
BULL29|So here you have, I think one month guys this movie is stronger.
NEUT30|I guess you need to understand that this kind of moves.
BULL31|They have some momentum.
BULL32|When you have a strong move like this, you might have a rebound, but guys it's going to get sold again alright and we need you need to have this consolidation.
BEAR33|I don't see any consolidation here guys.
BEAR34|This is too fresh.
NEUT35|I don't think this is the end of the correction for Foo.
NEUT36|Foo is going to correct more, at least in time and maybe nothing spot.
NEUT37|I'm not 100% sure we go into 2380%, sure, but this is enough for me to actually wait before making any move here.
NEUT38|If we go to 23, of course you average down guys you buy more.
NEUT39|You buy more and careful gas because we can break it.
NEUT40|Break 23 an.
NEUT41|20 You don't want to hear that, but it would be wise to actually light a bit your position to be able to buy more lower, but we're not there yet.
BULL42|Guess for now 23 is a strong support.
NEUT43|I don't think we're going to break it.
NEUT44|I'm just saying guys how we actually set up trades as pro traders.
NEUT45|So let's check quickly.
NEUT46|The short interest on football.
NEUT47|See if it has increased.
NEUT48|So I go on MarketWatch.
BULL49|17% of short interest, so it has not changed, so I know it increased little bit.
NEUT50|It was 16 and 17, maybe a hedge funds are shooting the stuff.
NEUT51|Probably by the way, so you don't want to go against them guys, you need to wait for some more buying power to step in the game and reverse this trend and make some higher lows and higher highs before entering a trade.
NEUT52|So I guess that's it for me.
NEUT53|I hope you enjoyed this video and if you did, please don't forget to click the sub lighting Bell button.
NEUT54|So you're going to be the first to know when I upload anything.
BULL55|"New and stay close to shore as you guys."""
