BULL0|"""Look every day the battle lines around here become ever clearer."
NEUT1|Either tech is winning or the banks.
BULL2|The industrials are winning.
NEUT3|And neither at the same time.
NEUT4|Yeah, these two groups simply can't go up at once when long term interest rates behave when they are quiet like they were today.
NEUT5|The cyclical sink self self, self.
BEAR6|So in the text find their footing, which is today's action Dow plunging toward in 34 points?
BULL7|That's got a lot of industrial xentax SMB dip .06% the NASDAQ gained .76%.
NEUT8|That was easy when rates rise.
NEUT9|Well then the cyclical Soren Tech is dead.
NEUT10|Drum beat grows ever louder and we have to hear this obituaries like I used to write for years.
NEUT11|Rise Reporter.
NEUT12|About all of our friends.
BULL13|In fact we got a reprieve from that today thanks to a sedate bond market and that's a big deal by the way.
NEUT14|After seven straight weeks, a higher rate, seven weeks of capital, fleeing from formerly beloved tech stocks and taking refuge in the banks industrials.
NEUT15|Although they're no longer cheap, but that's what happens when the economy booms, but this reprieve won't last as long as there are reasons for rates to keep climbing.
NEUT16|Reasons like stimulus.
NEUT17|A massive stimulus or a stronger job market, or higher prices for everything under the sun, AKA inflation.
NEUT18|Right now we've got plenty of reasons.
NEUT19|There's tons of stimulus check this week.
NEUT20|Lot of my friends did.
NEUT21|And no, I know I'm in that bracket where it's OK.
NEUT22|It's OK, I'm at the back.
NEUT23|I got the shot first anyway and then about the only commodity that isn't flying.
NEUT24|This Coco.
BEAR25|Someone recommended Hershey this week as Coco is not up on the unemployment rate though is still nearly doubled before what it was before the pandemic.
NEUT26|Which is why the Federal Reserve refuses to to focus on inflation.
BEAR27|Fed Chief Jay Pal keeps making the point that persistently high unemployment, especially among African Americans and Hispanics, is much more dangerous than a temporary spike in inflation.
NEUT28|And boy, do I agree with them, as I keep telling you the bomb market can't stand, pal stands here, it's too bleeding heart for these tight money folk, which is why we keep seeing the steady drum beat of sellers and all sorts of bonds.
NEUT29|When that happens.
NEUT30|Hedge funds.
NEUT31|Algorithmically meaning just kind of like, well, almost, mathematically.
NEUT32|Drawing conclusion.
BEAR33|They dump consistently fast growers like tech, and they doubled down more cyclical stocks, like the industrials indigo for the banks.
BULL34|Because the bond market took that breather today in rates didn't go up, we actually rolled back some of that action.
NEUT35|That said, the inflation is not going away anytime soon because they're true believers.
