NEUT0|"""I'm being greedy with my entries, but I'm looking for."
NEUT1|Now this pull back down into here.
NEUT2|This is the one I was looking for, right?
NEUT3|There is an Amazon on here and it looks like I just got.
BEAR4|Bottom ticked Amazon.
NEUT5|Whatever freaking entry, really.
NEUT6|You can't get any better now.
NEUT7|I'm literally the bottom tick, not $0.10 to it.
NEUT8|Literally the monitor you know.
NEUT9|Again, I'll be looking to take profits into when Amazon here.
NEUT10|Want to take profits in the 80s?
NEUT11|Way this thing's trading right now though, and I have such a good entry, I'm just going to take a little bit.
BULL12|We take a little bit of profit, pay myself so no matter what, I got some money on the table here in the screen trade, but I think there's more upside coming here.
NEUT13|I'm shooting for.
NEUT14|Top of the hour consuming for the high of the 60 minute Pathfinder 3202 that profits into 9802.
NEUT15|Is that 02?
NEUT16|Is the Pathfinder anyway, that's the target, so taking a little bit of profits there will definitely look into add.
NEUT17|Want to be patient here to get on that.
NEUT18|The next strike, right?
NEUT19|So like taking profits looking to get some more on, but I need a good set up here.
NEUT20|I'd love to pull back into 3200 which I got right there in that five minute but.
NEUT21|I didn't pull the trigger on it, so I'm going to wait.
NEUT22|Let this hour close and see what kind of setup I can get there.
NEUT23|Soaking this 3200, I went ahead and got that other strike on.
NEUT24|Oh yeah.
NEUT25|Rip right?
NEUT26|It's a 30 minute.
NEUT27|I'll take it well, I've already done everything you know profit taking all that everything I've got now is for this break.
NEUT28|"A 3200 area."""
