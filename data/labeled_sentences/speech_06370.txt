BULL0|"""The markets they are rallying this morning here in the US all news that Europe Central top Banker says we will get it done."
NEUT1|Paul vigna.
NEUT2|He is the host of the Markets Hub and my good friend here on lunch break to explain all things with the economy.
NEUT3|What you're going to do?
NEUT4|Sink Lee eloquently this morning.
NEUT5|I don't know about the sink door eloquent, but I'll try to be quick.
NEUT6|Give it a shot while trying to be quick.
NEUT7|What did he say?
NEUT8|So he came out and he Speaking of Mario Draghi, ECB president was speaking at a conference in London an what he came out and said was the real money line was we will do whatever it takes.
NEUT9|That's what he said and he said he had it and believe me it will be enough.
NEUT10|That's what he said that got the markets attention.
NEUT11|A lot of questions about what the EC will BCB will do what they can do just to hold water, ozone together simply right.
NEUT12|Yeah, and what he was saying was that we will do whatever it takes to save the euro, right?
NEUT13|He said we will not let it fall.
NEUT14|We have the power, he said.
BEAR15|It is irreversible.
NEUT16|The euro.
NEUT17|So he's being very firm about the fact that there will not be a euro breakup.
NEUT18|Any substance behind the brave words.
NEUT19|OK, and that's the issue.
NEUT20|Now the market reacted for a couple of reasons.
BEAR21|One, it's been very jittery.
BEAR22|I think this is a lot of short covering.
BEAR23|They've been down a lot in the last week or so, so it was really just kind of a catch up.
NEUT24|The other thing is there have been a lot of questions about how willing the ECB is to go the extra mile to go as far as they will go, and he sort of said without giving any details will do whatever it takes.
BEAR25|Market went flying all of all sectors.
BEAR26|I mean yeah, everything, everything went up, commodities went up, Spanish bond yields Italian bond yields came down sharply.
BULL27|Equities obviously went up the 10 year.
NEUT28|the US 10 year didn't move.
NEUT29|That much was very interesting, rating.
NEUT30|Euros over 123, but now you're already seeing it's afternoon.
BULL31|The Dow was up 250 points.
NEUT32|You just saw the chart up there.
BEAR33|It's up to 150 points right now, so very short lived.
NEUT34|Yeah yeah I mean, look unless you get some substance behind a statement like that the markets are going to test you.
BULL35|They're going to continue to test you.
NEUT36|You have to provide more than just at this stage in the game.
NEUT37|More than just verbal reassurances, you have to provide something concrete till you do that.
NEUT38|The markets aren't going to believe it.
NEUT39|So yes.
BEAR40|They will rally the you know the shorts get caught out of position.
NEUT41|They'll have to buy and catch up.
NEUT42|You'll get these kinds of rallies, but until you see something concrete on the table.
BEAR43|You are going to have a lot of doubts in the job security for you.
NEUT44|Paul vigna.
BULL45|Thanks for being with us, right?
NEUT46|"Yeah, alright, see you soon."""
