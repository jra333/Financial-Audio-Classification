NEUT0|"""We increased what is going on."
NEUT1|Today is November 13th, 2020.
BEAR2|The market is officially closed and we are approaching new highs.
NEUT3|Who would have thought?
NEUT4|Oh, I know who me?
NEUT5|I would have thought so for the past two months we've been tracking the SNP.
NEUT6|An IWM and this is nothing miraculous at all.
NEUT7|We just been doing the same exact exercise every single week, right?
NEUT8|So here we are in the market, is near new highs, not at new highs, but near new highs an would have predicted is that the Russell will be the leader, so let's take a look and let's jump right into this.
NEUT9|So the first chart that you see right now is the SNP.
NEUT10|So like I said for the past two months we've been tracking this.
BULL11|The SMP is approaching new highs.
BEAR12|We hit it, it faded off.
BULL13|It did not go down too far, and now we're still hovering near those highs.
NEUT14|So what you see here?
NEUT15|We got a couple of things going on.
NEUT16|We cannot ignore the other side of the trade.
NEUT17|OK, the other side of the trade is the potential triple top.
NEUT18|Alright, so we have one.
NEUT19|2.
BULL20|Three alright, so we have three hits at this resistance level.
BULL21|It could potentially fall, but I'm actually looking to see this continue higher and the reason being is because it has been hanging around that high so we have some momentum in our favor, so that is the SMP.
NEUT22|Let's go ahead and check out Russell.
BULL23|So here is the Russell Anwood I looked at last week, was looking forward to continue to remain above 170 and it has done just that.
NEUT24|It made his high backed off and did the same exact thing where it hung out around that 170 area.
BULL25|So I actually am looking forward to this.
NEUT26|Going back up to test his highs and create new ones so.
NEUT27|That's it, that's as easy as ever going to be.
NEUT28|That wraps up this week's market analysis.
NEUT29|Don't forget to check out my boys Kim and Kenny every single Sunday or marathon money.
