NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
BEAR1|Back on the video today, today will be about Zoom ticker, symbol ZM and I'll be giving you guys some key support and resistance levels to look forward to as the stock has been having a real decent drop.
NEUT2|Which is normal kind of 'cause.
NEUT3|Look at this, run that it had been having a lot of runs up with no downside with it.
BULL4|It had this downside right here to make this healthy, so that's why I kept going up.
BULL5|But I actually like this opportunity coming.
NEUT6|So before I had this as a resistance level, as you can see, it was right on the key point and back up to it and then drop.
NEUT7|This is our chart by the way, so this is a recent resistance level that I see.
BULL8|The price does come up too, or just around the 3:50 level.
NEUT9|It could hit it and then come back down for lower prices.
BEAR10|But this is a support first support low that I see at 325.9.
NEUT11|The second one is 329.
NEUT12|And the last defense to see some bullishness is 286.49, so these are the three support levels I see.
NEUT13|I want price to come up, preferably to the second one.
NEUT14|The second one is where I will start looking for call options.
NEUT15|On the first one is just a test support.
NEUT16|So the first one is really just to see if price is still bearish or bullish to see how it acts around this price level.
NEUT17|But if it does break it, then this is the one that I'm really looking at to start buying that.
BEAR18|But these are your two key support levels, and then if it breaks this one and then comes here, an breaks less well then I will turn ultimately super bearish.
BEAR19|Right now I am bearish.
NEUT20|Of course the stock is moving but it's getting close to these levels so I am being interested in getting some of these call options and also give some shares to hold for longer term.
BULL21|And I do think Zoom will do good in the future.
NEUT22|'cause I don't think we'll go back from zoom, so I want to get some chairs around this level and call options around this level, but this is just my test support level just to see how price reacts right here.
NEUT23|OK, so make sure you guys have these levels in your zoom chart for the next week coming up and this will dies when it gets these levels.
NEUT24|This will tell us what zoom will be doing and now have more insight and then I can make another video about the zoom.
