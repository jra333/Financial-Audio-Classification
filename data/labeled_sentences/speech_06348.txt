BEAR0|"""The Dow is down almost 100 points, huh?"
NEUT1|China?
NEUT2|Is it the China thing?
NEUT3|Yeah, there's there's two things going on in that China story.
NEUT4|There's one about the, you know, the the slowdown next year.
BEAR5|But their economy cooling.
NEUT6|The other thing was that they raised fuel prices.
NEUT7|You know, they're not controlled by the market over there.
NEUT8|They set the price is right there, so that's a double whammy.
NEUT9|Basically, it's slowing growth and inflation, and those are two things that the market hate, so we got.
NEUT10|So this can.
BEAR11|I will come out with Beach Beach we built and said that they see iron ore demand slowing in China.
NEUT12|In the store, but guess what?
BEAR13|This really put a halt on the stock, right, right?
NEUT14|I mean hit overnight the gas price story was out yesterday, so some of the sounds of the markets fishing for something particular here, right?
BULL15|OK, it definitely is because especially when that comes in, the worry about inflation when it comes in with the with the 10 year yield breaking out to new highs.
NEUT16|You know above the 200 day average, there's a lot of technical stuff going on there.
NEUT17|It kind of you realize what that means is that you know the inflation expectations aren't going to remain stable and subdued like the Fed keeps saying.
NEUT18|So even if this works very well with your technical analyst kind of guy, you know all these things.
NEUT19|I mean, I want to ask about this.
NEUT20|How much of this self that we're seeing today is really technical?
BEAR21|I mean the stocks have been on fire, everything's been rising.
BEAR22|They're all at multi year highs.
NEUT23|How much of this pullback is just sort of technical?
NEUT24|I think that I think that's what it is.
BEAR25|I mean, especially since the last two weeks since we had the last big hundred 200 point down day in the Dow actually hasn't been a very strong rally.
BULL26|It's been a very steady.
BEAR27|It's going sharp, but it's been very steady and we just kind of broken that uptrend in the in the S&P 500.
NEUT28|Now we're just seeing a technical stuff that you mentioned that the 10 year Treasury yield in there as a factor in these technical plan.
NEUT29|That of course is more than technical concern.
NEUT30|It's a fundamental concern because it's the gauge of how what your risk free alternative is.
NEUT31|And of course there's always this trade off, and so if we're seeing Treasury yields start to rise all the sudden, stop, don't stop.
NEUT32|Don't quite look as cheap as they did and and ultimately you get.
NEUT33|You get this trend, but where exactly is the level that in from a technical standpoint, the 10 year yield starts to?
NEUT34|I live in this context.
NEUT35|It was actually the 200 day moving average a few days ago that didn't really hit home to Wall Street yet because they didn't make the connection.
NEUT36|A lot of strategists are saying, well, if the bonds go down then the money will go into stocks, but it depends on why the why yields are going up.
BEAR37|If bonds are going down because of inflation, that's not good for stocks.
BULL38|You know, now that we've had this big run up to S&P is up 30% from the October hottest.
BEAR39|October lows.
NEUT40|Are people going to start trying to call the top here?
NEUT41|Or if you were going to say well, it was the Apple thing.
NEUT42|Or it was the three indexes getting over the big Now?
BEAR43|I mean, people are going to stop.
NEUT44|Are people going to start trying to talk take this market?
NEUT45|If they do then it might just be a little bit of a pause.
BEAR46|That's been the problem.
NEUT47|Is the whole way up.
NEUT48|We've been trying to pick the top and it just hasn't been happening.
NEUT49|It's when they when they start saying oh I'm I can't wait for this dip to start buying again.
NEUT50|That's when you start to see the market really sell off when you start.
NEUT51|You know when the when the dips when the dips actually happen then that could actually be a problem.
NEUT52|So for now you worried, concerned but not quite yet.
BEAR53|We got to see you know we need to see a string of losses.
BEAR54|The Big down day.
BEAR55|"A little couple of days another big down day and you start to see that the buyers aren't there that you thought they were."""
