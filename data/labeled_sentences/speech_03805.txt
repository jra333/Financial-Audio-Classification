NEUT11|Google's founder in 1998.
NEUT12|Starting with a simple idea of a better search engine on the Internet.

NEUT15|So how does Google makes money right?
NEUT16|Google allow businesses to display ever distance on their platform or networks or platforms and charge them advertising fee right?
NEUT17|In 2018 about 85% of Google revenue comes from advertising fee.

NEUT19|You know, year that also translate to a healthy earning per share growth year on year as well in business for more than two decades, Google has been very conservative with death.
NEUT20|Keep it at a very low level so if you have invested 100 shares in Google back in 20 oh, nine at an average price of $200 per share, there's a thought about $20,000 or invest each attack this 100 till today by doing nothing.
BULL21|Like the share price went up from 200 to $1250 in 2019 and that means you're $20,000 investors who have grown to 135 thousand.
NEUT22|Wow, there's 100 and $5000 profit, or 6.25 times of your investment.
