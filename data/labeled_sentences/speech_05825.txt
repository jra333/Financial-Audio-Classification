NEUT0|"""This is Alan Farley from FX Empire Royal Caribbean cruises."
BULL1|Broke out above 2000, resistance in the upper 50s in 2014 and rallied up to almost the 140 level at the start of 2018.
BULL2|That marked the all time high ahead of this very broad double top pattern that broke to the downside during the first quarter's pandemic sell off.
BULL3|The stock pulled back to the 2000 high and it broke that high as well, setting up two resistance levels.
NEUT4|One here at this double top in the upper 80s and also this 2000 high in the upper 50s and low 60s and I can see this 2016 low.
BULL5|That's when the stock pulled back and tested the breakout level successfully.
BEAR6|So this entire zone in here along with the descending 200 day moving average represents a very very strong resistance.
BEAR7|Now of course after the deep sell off there was an oversold bounce and that bounce when mounted.
BEAR8|About two of those resistance lines and then settled back down below this line where it ended the week.
BULL9|Now this is still very very strong resistance, despite very very interesting buying pressure.
BEAR10|These are pleased bottom Fishers, but these are also shorts, being forced to cover after this very, very big sell off.
NEUT11|So this sort of combination is lifted on balance.
BULL12|Volume brings to all time highs, so that's a that's a bullish thing.
NEUT13|"But until cruise ship start to sail again, Royal Caribbean will have a noose around its neck."""
