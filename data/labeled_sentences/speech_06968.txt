NEUT0|"""Hi there, we're David and Tom Gardner Co."
NEUT1|Founders and Co. Chairman of The Motley Fool.
NEUT2|Now you'd be right to expect on the first day of April that The Motley Fool would be continuing its 26 year tradition of putting up a creative April Fools Day prank on our website.
NEUT3|And there's always room for laughter and a good prank.
NEUT4|But today the rightest thing to do is to focus our attention on America and the world as we battle together to slow the spread of COVID-19.
NEUT5|Today, 40% of all US cases are in the state of New York.
NEUT6|You can see behind me beautiful New York Bay Bridge to Brooklyn.
BEAR7|The case counts in New York City are deeply concerning.
NEUT8|There are few hospitals opening right now in Central Park.
NEUT9|So we reached out to the Office of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for guidance.
NEUT10|And we now direct our attention.
NEUT11|All of us fools this April Fools Day to health research incorporated.
NEUT12|This is a non profit in the state of New York that the state is using to quickly gather and redirect funds as quickly as possible to the areas of greatest need to provide protective equipment ventilators the treatment of patients, support for health care staff to establish mobile facilities and to provide housing, feeding and transportation to the 70,000 volunteering health care professionals that are coming to New York from around the country right now.
BULL13|The Motley Fool is donating $1,000,000 today to the cause trying to do our small part to help a cultural and commercial center of the world.
NEUT14|We love you.
NEUT15|New York.
NEUT16|As Governor Cuomo said right now, New York is the Canary in the coal mine for our entire country.
BULL17|What we can learn from New York and who we can help together will benefit us all.
NEUT18|We invite you to join us this April Fools Day to contribute to this organization Health Research Incorporated, or to find a similar one in your hometown, city or state.
NEUT19|And please share your stories with us all.
BULL20|Our goal together is to make the world smarter, happier, and richer forever.
NEUT21|Fools don't worry, we're going to spring an April Fools joke on you at some point this year when the timing is right and the virus is stifled.
NEUT22|Let's make that happen as quickly as possible.
NEUT23|Stay inside.
NEUT24|Stay safe.
NEUT25|Let's all do our part together.
BULL26|"And thank you for being a member of The Motley Fool."""
