BEAR0|"""Welcome back to 10X stocks like subscribe and let's get into latest NEO stock analysis and predictions December 29th in today's NIO stock analysis and predictions why NIO stock is down?"
NEUT1|Let's get started.
BEAR2|The electric vehicle manufacturer now, who has been growing at incredible speeds in 2020, has experienced a pullback due to short term traders selling off the stock, due to Alibaba's investigation due to this Neo stock price also experienced attention and pull back due to the highly Bob.
BEAR3|Investigation and its sister financial company at group whose blockbuster EPO was cancelled at the last minute in early November, and their joint founder Jack Ma, however.
BULL4|Long term investors in Neo stock should be happy that this dip happened so they can get more shares and make more profit.
NEUT5|There is no doubt in analysts minds that Neo is currently at a discounted price.
NEUT6|Let's not forget that even Boneo pulled back today.
BULL7|The stock is still up, just over 1000% compared to last year.
BEAR8|NIO stock pulled back from its all time high at $57.20 peak for the last year, but the current price is still above last year's price of just over $2.00.
NEUT9|Another thing, Neo is getting more and more attention from large hedge fund managers.
NEUT10|In the current third quarter, 35 hedge funds reporting their Holdings of Neo shares, this is 5 funds more than the second quarter.
NEUT11|What does this mean for investors?
NEUT12|Hedge funds investments reflect how they view NEO stock and how they see the future of this company.
BULL13|Now is still a good long term investment despite its recent pullback due to short sellers like I always say, you shouldn't worry about 2% drops if you are in it for the long term.
BULL14|Nio's fundamentals are good.
NEUT15|However, there are some outside factors like Alibaba currently influencing the stock price.
BULL16|Now is still producing record breaking deliveries with a total of 73,000 vehicles at the end of November.
NEUT17|Smart investors should be able to see Niles long term potential Nile is for the long term and a lot of people comment on my videos saying how the price dropped to the bottom.
NEUT18|But in reality nothing goes up in a straight line and 2% drops are normal.
NEUT19|Now is a risky stock and those with scarcity mindset should not invest in it.
NEUT20|In my opinion Neo is still a buy.
NEUT21|However, investors should not chase big profits.
NEUT22|They should instead write the stock for years into the future.
NEUT23|The gains that Neo is producing for its investors today cannot be compared to the gains it will produce in the next five years.
BULL24|Hold long and strong blue skies are coming.
BULL25|Thanks for watching.
