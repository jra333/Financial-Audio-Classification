NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Mike in today's stock."
NEUT1|Today is Marathon digital assets stock trades on the NASDAQ and symbol Mara.
BULL2|The stock was simple most 9% yesterday up to $48.00 in two cents.
BULL3|Exceeding the 52 week high on Marathon is $50.21.
BULL4|The stock actually was positive for the month after just some frustrated movements down and up.
BULL5|However, I think this is a really positive sign now for those who don't know, Marathon Digital Holdings is basically a Bitcoin miner.
NEUT6|The wind, the largest Bitcoin miners in the world and.
NEUT7|Marathon tends to be a sort of leverage to play on the price of Bitcoin now.
NEUT8|Right now Bitcoin is sitting at around between 58 and $59,000 and the all time high on Bitcoin is $61,000 and it really looks like Bitcoin is about to break out and hit some new highs, and if it does hit some new highs one the profit one of the target prices for bitcoins can be about $68,000, which will be about a 12 to 14% move.
NEUT9|Now if we get that 12 to 14% move, we could possibly see a very quick 20 to 25% move in Marathon Digital Holdings, and I'm talking about a 20 to 25% move just during the month of April.
NEUT10|Now in order for Marathon to get big movement.
NEUT11|So you need two things to happen.
BULL12|You need the price of Bitcoin to go up and you also need the small cap stocks to do well.
BEAR13|Now the small cap stocks have been having trouble over the past couple of weeks.
NEUT14|However, I think we're kind of in the clear with all the troubles we've been having with small caps and I think the small caps represented here by the Russell 2000 ETF is going to do well over the month of April, so I think we're going to have is the confluence of two events, or we're going to have a Bitcoin hitting new highs and then we're going to see a rally in the small caps and you combine those two together.
BULL15|Marathon should do really well.
BULL16|This is the one month chart for the small caps here, and you could see it did have a challenging month, but I think we're going to get out of this and move higher during the month of April.
BULL17|So with the rally, impending rally in small caps and impending rally in Bitcoin, I think Marathon Digital.
BULL18|Holdings is going to be probably one of the leading stocks during the month of April, and I'm thinking that it can definitely hit a new 52 week high and just keep on running an.
NEUT19|I would put a target on Marathon before the end of April at $60.00 a share.
NEUT20|I own marathon and I intend to buy more of the stock next week.
BULL21|Unfortunately, I have to wait until Monday to get more cash, but I'm definitely looking to add to my marathon Holdings 'cause I think it has much more to run, so that's my stock of the day.
BULL22|I hope you enjoy it.
