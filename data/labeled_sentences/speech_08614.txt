BULL0|"""Welcome back everybody."
BEAR1|XR peas going nightmare mode.
BULL2|Massive breakout yesterday Candle only yesterday kinda was around 50%.
BULL3|Gains for a large dog.
NEUT4|OK, this is number 4 by market cap.
NEUT5|This is huge huge move and look at the volume.
NEUT6|The volume broke out in the same volume almost 6 billion.
NEUT7|We flipped ethereum with the volume.
NEUT8|This is a massive volume for extra P. This looks like a serious movies coming for extra P. I'm expecting a move to around $2.00.
NEUT9|Let me show you the extension here.
NEUT10|So you take that you use the field extension tool.
NEUT11|You measure that leg to measure that like.
BULL12|Now, obviously we're going to hit some resistance at the dollar.
NEUT13|Probably going to something, maybe even overshoot.
NEUT14|Come back to the dollar, flip it as support, and then continue higher.
NEUT15|But this thing it's probably going to go to 1.3 and the hyper bullish target for this leg.
NEUT16|You know I'm talking about we're talking about this week, guys this week this week and move in the coming days.
NEUT17|We're not talking about like a month in a month.
NEUT18|It can go much higher, but we're talking about in this.
NEUT19|In coming days we can see XRP going to $2.00 guys seriously, but you know not a financial advice.
NEUT20|Do your own research.
NEUT21|It can also be a fake out, you know.
NEUT22|Be careful when you trade ex RP.
NEUT23|You always have to learn how to use stop loss and you know protect yourself because this is a very unpredictable coin now.
NEUT24|Also you can see what we get in here on the 12 hour look at.
NEUT25|This hammer is still is still confirmed.
BEAR26|It still didn't close this 12 hour candle.
BEAR27|We have another three hours but death looking hyper bullish if you're going to close like that.
NEUT28|You're gonna see a massive move.
NEUT29|Forex RP now.
NEUT30|Now you know X RP when it's moving.
NEUT31|Look at that that pump this pump ignore it because that was the Wall Street.
NEUT32|Bet you know manipulation pump.
NEUT33|It's not a real organic path.
NEUT34|This is an organic plan for extra P once it broke out it went up 150% in a nice parabolic fashion.
NEUT35|OK that's what I'm expecting here.
NEUT36|If you take 150% roughly you know 100% will take you to 1.15.
NEUT37|I think this will be a critical area to break.
NEUT38|And 150% will take you.
NEUT39|2.

NEUT47|Look at, let me zoom in here.
BEAR48|Sorry bout that.
NEUT49|XP breakouts right by the break of 65 OK .65 that's where I've been buying it here right here.
BULL50|.65 OK, we are already up on the bag.
BULL51|50% obviously we took some profits along the way.
NEUT52|Now what we're going to do is just going to haul it till it's going to flip till going to show us a rejection candle.
NEUT53|I'm I'm going to hold it to around $2.00 level.
NEUT54|Then I'm going to see what I'm going to do, but at the moment just let the bag ride this thing.
