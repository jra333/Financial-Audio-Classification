BEAR0|"""Are you guys still broadly positioned for for a weaker dollar?"
BULL1|Hi David, thank you for having me again.
BEAR2|Yes, we still are biased for a weakening dollar, particularly as we move into 2021.
NEUT3|Basically, we think that we have the key elements for some dollar weakness.
BULL4|First China leading growth in a very strong way, demanding a lot of commodities.
BULL5|This in general is positive for emerging markets.
NEUT6|We have less turbulence between US and China.
BEAR7|With Biden, and also the view of low for long for rates in the US, so it's a it's a benign backdrop for emerging markets and usually we should expect some weakening in the dollar in this in this backdrop.
NEUT8|Right now the trade.
NEUT9|I would imagine moving into next year.
NEUT10|This can't continue in a straight line.
BULL11|It becomes a little bit more differentiated within the AM basket.
NEUT12|What do you like the most?
NEUT13|What has more upside in your view?
NEUT14|Right, yeah, it's true.
NEUT15|David we saw this year the rhyming be leading the process right in the appreciation.
BEAR16|So we think it's hard to see the same momentum in China.
NEUT17|Lot took place already in the in the remain be we still like China?
NEUT18|The government bonds as a carry proposition that yields are interesting and there is room for slightly more appreciation in the room maybe, but it's probably.
BULL19|What we're going to see is more a catch up in in the currencies that are lagging and that still offer decent huge and also more upside.
BEAR20|So for example, the Indonesian rupiah or the Indian rupee that are weak, still weaker year to date.
NEUT21|For example, we think that there is room for a catch up next year for sure and they also offer this and carry.
NEUT22|Yeah Julie, I was going to ask you about the carry trade and also the UN's role as an anchor in this region.
NEUT23|Does that continue?
NEUT24|Do you think?
NEUT25|Yes, so on the way we see on the rooming B is the book of the trade of the appreciation already took place.
NEUT26|We see, for example, the way we like to see is look at the C Fats basket because we think that's more important for Chinese authorities.
NEUT27|So we saw a move that came all the way from 91 close to 96 in the basket.
NEUT28|We think we could see something like 98.
NEUT29|Next year, something that could could be a game changer is if the Biden administration actually cut tariffs.
NEUT30|That's something that probably could move the rhyming be in in a bigger way, but that's not what we think is the baseline, at least not for the near term.
NEUT31|"So in that case, ******* be is is more of a carry with mild appreciation, but not a big trade for capital gains."""
