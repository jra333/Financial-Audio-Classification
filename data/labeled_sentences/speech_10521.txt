NEUT0|"""Jim, let's start with that Goldman."
NEUT1|Note that we referenced in that you were talking about with Becky a moment ago.
BULL2|Basically looking for solid gains into year end into the year.
NEUT3|After that, the year after that, but it collides with sort of the darkening picture that we're seeing on Covid in the US.
BULL4|Well look, I think that one of the things that David costumes doing and David is an optimist, which, by the way is certainly served him well during this.
NEUT5|Is really identifying the principle weakness that we had.
NEUT6|If you go back to Friday, there was a belief that the only companies that could really do well.
NEUT7|Where the Fang Anfang derivatives, because we were not going to see any, and to the pandemic, the idea that we got a vaccine, it was really was a November surprise, a 90% efficacy vaccine was not in the cards.
NEUT8|So I think that David's pieces is very right, with the exception of the titles have already informed him.
NEUT9|I don't like the roaring 20s redux, 'cause the roaring 20s ended so badly, but I do like about it is that while the election is certainly important, what he's saying is we've got a rebounding.
BEAR10|In profits we have a falling risk premium in equities oil, which I agree does suggest using a barbell, but I just think that he's dead right that that you with the COVID-19 virus you can get away from just big tech and I see a lot of industrials David where people are just frantically raising numbers and that has to do with the fact that maybe in 2021 we will have this under control.
BULL11|Well, we've gotten some optimistic commentary about it.
NEUT12|I mean, Alex azar.
NEUT13|Yesterday, I believe Fouchy also saying some things that indicate perhaps to the point you were making earlier in the week, that it could be as soon as this spring that we really start to see wide vaccinations which would be of course a great thing to think that if you were heading into the summer and you could get back to some normalcy, then 'cause many people still believed it would be probably not until next fall, right?
NEUT14|Jim?
NEUT15|So that's all a good thing we continue to see this sort of this dichotomy in the market.
NEUT16|Some of these stay at home plays.
BEAR17|Losing some ground as you point out the industrials.
NEUT18|We've also talked about the equal weighted S&P and how that's outperformed of late, but again, I come back to this question.
NEUT19|Do you really see growth being abandoned for the longer term here is value, as it's often been just a very brief play that once again will be sold when I don't know when the market changes its mind, which it seems to do every time.
NEUT20|Yeah, growth doesn't classify out of style because the growth companies are the ones that adapt very quickly.
NEUT21|And then when you have a company, let's say you have.
NEUT22|Alphabet OK alphabet, is it static?
NEUT23|No outputs and advertising drive site site that needs travel advertising which is the biggest and the best.
NEUT24|Suddenly you get that.
BEAR25|Does Facebook really get hurt here?
NEUT26|No, because they're beginning to have a tremendous number of ads that are direct and very inexpensive.
NEUT27|To be able to promote businesses.
NEUT28|I find these companies just keep coming up with new ideas.
NEUT29|But David yeah, of all things we have to watch Datadog.
NEUT30|Datadog datadog OK not underdog datadog no not underdog the like that show too true.
BULL31|Like Huckleberry hound to Datadog is a company that revenue growth from 80% down to 68% now 61% in this quarter.
NEUT32|But David it sells it 40 times sales OK. OK so now you have to watch that kind of stop because that's what's front and center of what's being sold and coral.
BEAR33|I think people are sick and tired of paying a huge amount of on sales when they have the opportunity to pay an not great amount on earnings.
NEUT34|So watch datadog.
NEUT35|As being the tell of this tape.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
