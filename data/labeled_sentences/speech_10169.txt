BULL0|"""Hello everyone, I hope everyone is having a great day."
NEUT1|You're watching market craze if you're new here.
NEUT2|My name is Steven.
NEUT3|If you're a returning member, welcome back.
NEUT4|Alright boys and girls, ladies and gentlemen, stock traders alike.
NEUT5|You already know we're going to talk about AMC today, so AMC is a stock that I think everyone has kind of had their eyes on over the past couple of weeks.
NEUT6|Whether you trade or not, I think that you were part of the hysteria going around with AMC, AMC and GameStop basically became the forefront of Internet memes, which really helped them skyrocket in price recently.
BULL7|I mean, AMC is up like I think like 400% since this whole thing started in GameStop recently, peaked at like 390 or $450.
NEUT8|It was insane.
NEUT9|GameStop started the month at like 15 bucks like Imagine this if you just put $100 in a GameStop and it went up to that 8000% and you cashed out at that 8000%, you would have literally turned your $100 into a $8000 interest gain.
NEUT10|That is just crazy talk, but we're not talking about GameStop.
BEAR11|We're talking about AMC today, so a lot of people get discouraged because they saw the growth rate of AMC today and it was not pretty guys.
NEUT12|I'm not going to lie as a shareholder of AMC.
NEUT13|I was pretty upset person, but this is not financial advice so I really don't want you guys to take anything that I say as financial advice.
NEUT14|Please do your own due diligence.
NEUT15|But as we have seen with the stock market in general, the people with diamond hands usually do win.
BULL16|In the end an.
NEUT17|Honestly I think that AMC could seriously.
NEUT18|It's 50 to $100 by the middle of this month.
NEUT19|I'm going to call it right now, and if I'm right, you all gotta give me 50 bucks.
NEUT20|No, not really.
BEAR21|I think a lot of people could call that anyway, but I think that it's kind of going to be really interesting to see what happens over the course of the next couple of days because what's going on right now is a sell off is going on with people higher up and it's making other people scared because they see the stock price going down.
NEUT22|And what happens is the big time big boys trying.
NEUT23|You know, draw up some fear in the after hours in the pre market because they have access to trade in those hours where a lot of us you know regular investors actually don't.
NEUT24|You know there are some apps that will allow you to, but Robin Hood it technically still is the most popular app on the App Store and Google Play Store.
NEUT25|As far as investing in trading an it does not allow you to trade in the after hours of pre market so it definitely would scare a lot of people if they see the stock price going down whenever they can't even trade whenever the market opens.
NEUT26|What are they going to do?
NEUT27|They're going to sell for the low of the low.
NEUT28|And then lose a lot of money and then 20-30 minutes later they're going to buy back up whenever it's able to kind of pick up some speed again.
NEUT29|Now again, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT30|Please do your own research, but this is something that I would not do myself.
NEUT31|I don't sell stocks for a loss, ever.
NEUT32|There are some exceptions.
NEUT33|If a stock is going into bankruptcy an I am losing money on that stock, I will sell it out, but it's very rare.
BULL34|I think AMC is going to be a long bumpy Rd guys and I think that it will pay off in the end.
NEUT35|Again.
NEUT36|I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT37|Don't take my advice for what it is, but I think will pay off anyway.
NEUT38|I'd love to know what you guys think about AMC.
NEUT39|Are you still holding how many shares of AMC do you have?
NEUT40|Anyway?
BULL41|"Hope you guys have a great rest your day piece."""
