NEUT0|"""Jim, I know you were watching the GM interview with Phil about this morning and the Nicola Promise of that Nikola Deal being finalized and the tightening of the race as Phil put it regarding battery technology."
NEUT1|So what implications does that have for Tesla?
NEUT2|Is competition at scale?
NEUT3|Finally here I think that I know that the GM people are very nice.
NEUT4|OK, so they should hold their ears.
NEUT5|You're not going to catch you just not going to catch the line.
NEUT6|I mean, he's just not gonna let it happen.
NEUT7|He is one step ahead of the posse.
NEUT8|At all times, and what would we say this morning on Brian Sullivan?
NEUT9|Show that Tesla something like their EV is bigger, bigger than all the other TV's combined.
NEUT10|So I think there's room.
NEUT11|I don't think it's a situation though, where Reed Hastings says I welcome competition.
NEUT12|I think that look, I, I think that Elon wants to destroy competition, so I'm not that worried, but remember, the younger people want TV and they want EV stocks.
NEUT13|I mean, got this Henrik Fisker on because the world came into my Twitter feed and said, how can you not love Henrik Fisker?
NEUT14|He's a designer, a designer of pollution free cars, and because Bill McDermott, we know, Bill from service now and Sep joined the board and because Magna data deal with them, I felt like I'm cornered here in being sceptical.
NEUT15|EV is so loved and you know much ivis loved.
NEUT16|Yes, I'm aware that it is.
NEUT17|It is in favor.
NEUT18|Yes, could you be more my love.
NEUT19|OK it's, it's loved the planet over.
NEUT20|What percentage of vehicles on the road or EV like 1%?
NEUT21|I think about 1% right?
BULL22|Yeah, but that means there's room.
NEUT23|There's a lot of room run without upside lot of Cam.
NEUT24|People come on my show at night.
NEUT25|On Monday.
NEUT26|The Tam is quite what he liked ammo shanter.
NEUT27|I mean, come on.
NEUT28|It's totally just market.
NEUT29|Don't speak the speeder.
NEUT30|Don't act like you're in second.
NEUT31|Your Business School which nobody goes to anymore.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
