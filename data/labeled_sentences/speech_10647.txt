BEAR0|"""This is horrible situation for our country, isn't it's really bad for the economy as a whole, but incredibly it doesn't seem as bad for the stock market and this is bad money."

NEUT2|Unless you already do.
BEAR3|When covid cases spike, people don't cash in their chips and go home.
NEUT4|Do they know they go where the action is?
NEUT5|They go where the hot tables are, the hot slots, the Hot Wheels, they follow that first, FedEx surged 12% today.
NEUT6|So good place to start is a hot table after stream of earnings.

NEUT13|How about camera favorite Shopify?
BULL14|Up 67 points craft site Etsy, other e-commerce facilitators, adobewhich.com fastly Salesforce.
NEUT15|Mostly stocks were between 4 and 6% although lagers like fastly, Adobe and Salesforce only valid 1 to 2%.

BULL22|Well, we got some great news from Pfizer.
NEUT23|There are conducting human trials for the Covid vaccine and so far everyone in the study is immunity.
NEUT24|There's just 24 people by just serious.
BULL25|No hype, kind of company and the vaccine data sent that stock up more than 3%.
NEUT26|If we can get a vaccine sooner than expected, that's used for vast swathes of the economy, although it's terrible for the smaller vaccine place, which is why they got eviscerated FedEx and Pfizer blue chips that spread all sorts of high flying stocks to become even more expensive and with good reason.

NEUT28|How can I talk about Tesla?
BULL29|The company I love rallied almost 40 points today.
NEUT30|This is now a $207 billion business larger than Toyota largest car company on Earth.
