BULL0|"""Yes, so you already know she would behave better with another."
NEUT1|Let's go ahead and jump right into you know.
NEUT2|Would like to waste nobody time for do that.
NEUT3|Let's get this video.
BULL4|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they would be touching base on SOS Limited.
NEUT5|Yeah I know we covered this stock every every single day so we can go too much in details.
NEUT6|It's just a quick update.
NEUT7|Some reassurance let you know what to expect.
BULL8|'cause in the last video I told you we could see another pull back this morning before we see a nice picture and I just want to say yeah yeah I'll be holding on this long.
NEUT9|You'd be crazy to go ahead and sell out now I'm down.
BEAR10|Down with four $500 on Friday, but this morning we experienced this pullback, your boy down with seven hundred $800 in SOS, but I'm not sweating.
NEUT11|I'm not panic selling because Bitcoin is looking good.
BULL12|Bitcoin Cash is looking good, etherium is looking good, these all plays I put you alone and I told you outdoors coin we have fun with that so let's get on it y'all.
NEUT13|I'm telling you this thing is about to go, it should be by to go.
NEUT14|Is most definitely is being manipulated.
NEUT15|I told you I would be cool with trading at $58,000 on the last run up on a previous life.
NEUT16|You and you understand from the last video when it was trading at 58 K. SOS was trading at around $1314.00 a share.
BULL17|But now now that it didn't pull back yet so it's full bank and Bitcoin went back up to 58.
NEUT18|K came down, went back up.
NEUT19|Its OS is not moving on the same path as Bitcoin but it's supposed to.
NEUT20|It's simply play.
NEUT21|Just like Maura is always right, all these are simply place the Bitcoin or Bitcoin do good and go up over time.
BULL22|These players will do good and go up overtime if Bitcoin fall off and go down.
NEUT23|These plays postponed to fall off and go there.
BULL24|So with that being said it so it's got a strong push this back to come.
BEAR25|It's gonna most definitely shake the tree.
NEUT26|Get these weak hands out 'cause I told you how to stock market ain't easy.
NEUT27|You just don't come in and get rewarded for nothing.
NEUT28|You feel me you got to put in some work, put in some kind of work.
BULL29|You seem steady up on some.
NEUT30|Don't just you think we don't just think stuff supposed to be handed to you in life?
NEUT31|You get what I'm saying.
NEUT32|I mean, I'm basically here this ******* stuff though calling out these stocks doing what I do here is to help you all, but I'm just saying though you know, think outside the box like don't just think like you know money just fall out the Sky because it don't.
NEUT33|You gotta work for it.
NEUT34|You gotta grind for it and you gotta be smart and meticulous and learn how to protect what you earn.
NEUT35|Protect what you got.
NEUT36|So anyways.
NEUT37|It's always man.
NEUT38|It's always about go.
NEUT39|Yeah, it's always bad go that's all I got for this video, you know continue to you know keep up with the updates, keep you updated on this every single day.
