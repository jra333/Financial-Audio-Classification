NEUT0|"""And of course, we're all thinking about the election."
NEUT1|That of course, is coming up tomorrow and this one stat that I've been thinking bout of last few days is the idea that the White House flips party control.
BEAR2|If the S&P is down three months before the election and it retains control the incoming party if the S&P is up.
NEUT3|And we've seen this happen in every election since 1984, and, well, the S&P 500 closed on August, the third at 3294, and today it sits at 3311.
BULL4|So we're up 17 points over that.
NEUT5|I guess history says this means Trump's going to win.
NEUT6|On the other hand, you could say it's basically flat and who knows what's going to happen.
NEUT7|"And of course, that is a very 2020 thing to be thinking about as we head towards this day."""
