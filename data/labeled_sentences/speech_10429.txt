NEUT0|"""Finally, just want everybody knows, and it's really shocking."
NEUT1|Let's have the charted Disney.
NEUT2|Please, will you look at this?
NEUT3|I love Disney and I love the stock child.
NEUT4|Trust owns it.
BULL5|I think it's got fantastic long term prospects, but the stock is now trading above was training at the end of January for we had any idea about the pandemic that feels crazy to me.
BEAR6|The parks are running at a fraction of full capacity, Disneyland's been closed since March.
BEAR7|No signs could be open cruises, you're grounded.
BEAR8|Movie theaters are closed.
BEAR9|Big blockbuster releases have been pushed back to next year.
BEAR10|ESPN's had a tough year with the truncated sport season.
NEUT11|It doesn't matter.
NEUT12|Maybe because they came up with Disney Plus, even though its streaming service loses a fortune, is it this one that is growing by leaps and bounds he understand?
NEUT13|It can you just think about this.
NEUT14|The Disney that you know is this Disney?
NEUT15|The Disney that people are buying, well, let's just say it's that Disney.
NEUT16|Like nothing happened.
NEUT17|Like nothing happened.
NEUT18|I understand I'm not picking stocks that actually better from the covid accommodation service.
NEUT19|Now PayPal or any of these central retailers like Home Depot which reports Marlow's, reports Lindsey.
NEUT20|These names are all about the stay at home thesis.
NEUT21|The virus allows them to make fortunes.
NEUT22|That's not Gordon.
NEUT23|That's not honey.
NEUT24|Well, that's not Disney.
BEAR25|These companies have been crushed by Covid.
NEUT26|There's zero hope that the next will be any good, yet it doesn't matter.
NEUT27|The buyers keep coming not for their companies, but for their stocks.
NEUT28|I often wonder who are these guys who's willing to look to the values of good numbers?
NEUT29|How is it possible?
NEUT30|They don't care about the near term?
NEUT31|How could they be so ridiculously optimistic?
NEUT32|Again, these are pangloss buyers.
NEUT33|They're pulling the trigger like all like all is for the best of all possible worlds.
NEUT34|I have to believe you know who I think this is the work of.
NEUT35|Youth.
NEUT36|Youth callow youth.
NEUT37|No ones who's been in the business for any length of time in the last 30 years would make these trades with only stocks appear there too obvious.
NEUT38|I've always seen this kind of action once before in the 1980s, where stocks that went to 80 then cruise to 90, then cruise to 100 and cruise to 120.
NEUT39|Don't laugh.
NEUT40|That was my sales pitch to a lot of people.
NEUT41|A lot of jaded people, like many people, are now and it always work because we were in one of those rare moments where you had to throw your discipline out the window.
NEUT42|Or at least that kind of discipline.
NEUT43|It's a moment like this one new discipline.
NEUT44|Crazy discipline.
NEUT45|Faith.
NEUT46|The bottom line, the real issue in this market is faith.
NEUT47|The buyers have faith in the future, something that feels out of place right now for most people with covid cases skyrocket, those in despair are sellers, but they're doing nothing but the believers.
NEUT48|Amazing, there doesn't seem to be a price that they won't pay.
NEUT49|At least for the moment.
