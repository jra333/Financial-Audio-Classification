BULL0|"""We realize that you, if you can digitize, then what you're really doing is becoming more efficient."
NEUT1|I mean, when I look at Chipotle, what do I see about Chipotle?
NEUT2|I can say that they got religion on tech, or I could say, you know what, they found a way to be able to have Chipotle means they found a way to be able to do delivery.
NEUT3|There they are able to do a supply chain management district, so why do I sell that David?
NEUT4|Why do I have to sell companies that got better during this.
NEUT5|Why can't I sell companies that didn't improve?
BEAR6|I have run up.
NEUT7|I don't know why can't you?
NEUT8|Well, I think you can.
NEUT9|OK then you think you should?
NEUT10|You're right.
NEUT11|It was rhetorical.
BULL12|I appreciate that.
NEUT13|Right now it's not looking for an endorsement.
NEUT14|I was looking for recognition that, you know, I I answered my name.
NEUT15|Make a lot of sense when you ask me to use my name.
NEUT16|I just I'm like whoop.

NEUT32|Oh yeah that's where I want to take that thing off.
BEAR33|That's a dangerous stock.
NEUT34|No case by case.
NEUT35|It is, but I mean you you can't fault investors for thinking a one day rally like the banks had yesterday should potentially be sold given the performance of the sector overall.
NEUT36|Don't listen.
BULL37|Yes, I see that you're going to 1% woo.
NEUT38|You know market can be sold about one city.
NEUT39|I don't know what to do.
