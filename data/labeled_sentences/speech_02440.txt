NEUT0|"""OK, so Disney we probably all watched that one rat movie by Pixar."
BULL1|Probably watched wall-e. We probably have went to Disney World a few times and it's pretty fun and so far the overstock does do pretty well.
BEAR2|It's super choppy.
BULL3|It's a little bit like doge coin, you know there's a lot of chop and so far you know on 2019 quarter four it was doing really well at around 100.
NEUT4|Forty $150 and coronavirus hits.
NEUT5|It went to the bottom of $85 and right now it's $108.00.
BULL6|Today it's growing really well at 2.37%.
NEUT7|And it's just, you know, stagnating.
NEUT8|It's just really flat.
BULL9|And here's the reason why that Disney stocks so far is actually doing pretty well.
NEUT10|If you check out Disney right now, you can see one of their biggest Disney World switches in Shanghai.
NEUT11|It's a US theme park.
NEUT12|It would open tickets today and it's sold out on Friday immediately and right now there's an analyst saying that Disney World could open sooner than expected.
NEUT13|So one of the biggest things about Disney World is they make a lot of money from the theme parks in the theme.
NEUT14|Parks are always closed.
BEAR15|They will actually go down a lot.
BEAR16|You can see Disney actually face a lot of resistance during the coronavirus crisis, and it only started going down in late February when all the parks were started become closed, eventually started going down and down, and there's a lot of resistance right here.
BEAR17|Could see people really felt like Disney shouldn't go down that much, but eventually went out even more.
NEUT18|And currently Disney soon also doing stuff like Star Wars, they got the Clone Wars, which is honestly pretty good.
NEUT19|I recommend it.
NEUT20|It was like the Mandalorian.
NEUT21|All those like really nice Disney movies and TV shows are getting a lot of attention.
NEUT22|And not only they making money from like a streaming services in Disney Plus is being super popular right now.
NEUT23|It's honestly getting a lot of Netflix users back on Disney because they fan quickly.
NEUT24|Has some pretty awesome shows and we look at the states reopening so many states are reopening California when the biggest states reopening begins Friday.
BEAR25|This is awesome and a lot of citizens of the United States are really mad that the coronavirus lockdown is being held so long.
NEUT26|The thing about a lot of citizens in America is they need money.
NEUT27|Like it boils down to money and that 1200 stimulus check doesn't go for everyone, and that's not enough to pay the bills.
NEUT28|And some people I saw enough to just feed the family.
NEUT29|And right now people really want to go back to their jobs and the work they need to make money like the economy has to be opened up like people don't want to dictate like people want to start because it can't get any food.
BEAR30|No one is getting jobs.
NEUT31|Unemployment rates are super high and there's already like some riots and stuff happening and just keep in mind that if all the states are starting to get open then that means Disney World will start being pumping.
NEUT32|And people keep going to like vacation hotspots and stuff, especially how right now is a summertime.
NEUT33|We could definitely see a lot of tickets being sold by Disney.
NEUT34|Just look at Shanghai.
NEUT35|It immediately sold out on day one like it's a maximum capacity.
NEUT36|Then again, we may be seeing a lot of people are having to wear a mask.
NEUT37|Can imagine seeing like Mickey Mouse wearing a mask and Disney World.
NEUT38|It is a little bit weird.
NEUT39|I'm pretty sure the tickets are a little bit cheaper during this pandemic.
NEUT40|But nevertheless with states opening up you also have Disneyland opening up as well.
BULL41|Shanghai Disneyland being sold out tickets in one single day.
NEUT42|Those are very, very bullish options.
NEUT43|So right now.
NEUT44|Definitely check out Disney.
BULL45|Their options are honestly pretty good.
NEUT46|They're pretty cheap.
NEUT47|It's not too late to buy him, so you guys probably buy them like a month out or maybe two months out and eventually give it some time.
NEUT48|It probably will be reaching 100 and 21130 and then one day $150.
NEUT49|Very very soon.
BULL50|"Thanks watching con blow."""
