BEAR0|"""What you saw yesterday people scratching their heads."
NEUT1|It was up I I've been trying to figure it out.
NEUT2|It's like.
NEUT3|The markets are bigger than every individual obviously, and in the markets don't necessarily have have a conscience, but.
NEUT4|The market is made up of a bunch of individuals, all of whom have come have consciousness.
NEUT5|But then again, there's so much algo trading and everything else going on that that maybe it is machines.
NEUT6|Maybe there.
NEUT7|Maybe it isn't individuals anymore, but but how do you put all that together to decide that?
NEUT8|Wow, it's really agnostic to these these new backdrops and just does its own thing?
BULL9|Goes up goes up again today.
NEUT10|I think you're right about the idea that it's machines and if you listen to all the people from 5:00 AM AM on.
NEUT11|You're hearing reflation trade reflation trade, and that means cell tech, and by the industrials, 'cause they're allegedly valued.
NEUT12|Now they've moved up so much they don't seem like value.
NEUT13|But that was a lot of machine buying.
NEUT14|You don't find Norfolk Southern 6-7 points with anything really happened Caterpillar up 910 eleven.
NEUT15|So I mean, I think that the market.
NEUT16|I don't say the market is immune.
NEUT17|There's individual stocks that are now way too high, but they're in the value side, not the tech side, so I can see it come back.
NEUT18|I think people were stunned.
NEUT19|The individuals were stunned Joe as you and I were, and your whole team is, but the machines don't get stunned because the machines don't have conscience.
NEUT20|I don't think that the market is divorced.
BEAR21|I think there's a lot of companies doing quite well, but I think the machines are divorced.
NEUT22|They didn't see what was happening in the capital.
NEUT23|They weren't shook like a lot of the guests that you've had this morning because in the end again, they are machines and they don't think they just do.
NEUT24|I think I've called you a machine so many times in my machine broke yesterday when I watched what happened, yeah, but you gotta get your machine needs.
NEUT25|3 hours of sleep and then it just is like in it's set on 10 and then it gets another three hours sleep.
NEUT26|In light of the machine, but I'm proud of that, but I but I watched yesterday.
NEUT27|Obviously I don't know how much that I mean, everybody feels pretty much the same except for we have to figure out what the goal is.
NEUT28|I heard Tom Friedman and there's a lot that I agree with, but you have to go forward.
NEUT29|We we have to go forward and well, does that mean it's going to be with the stock market?
NEUT30|I do follow the market, so my goal is to try to help people make money and not lose money within the context of what happened yesterday.
BULL31|But it's glad that I'm glad that there's a blast.
NEUT32|A blast zone that I didn't have to come on yesterday and talk about it 'cause it's really pretty.
NEUT33|We've been pretty crude to do, so that's the word I've been searching for.
NEUT34|It would be hard to exile half the country I guess.
NEUT35|Anyway, 25 states it's anyway.
BULL36|Thanks baby back after quarantine and I urge people to take quarantine seriously.
NEUT37|Yes, don't don't try to cuff that.
NEUT38|I thought Becky's comments about we hadn't talked about Covid for a long time.
NEUT39|Covid is very much in front of us.
NEUT40|Regardless of what happened in Washington, people must take mass quarantine, social distancing, different when a million cases in California or pre.
NEUT41|Basically in a very short period of time.
NEUT42|I don't feel safe here, so I think people should not feel safe.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
