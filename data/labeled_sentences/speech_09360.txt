BULL0|"""CR V has sold another 32% today upon news that Lucid Motors is getting closer to agreeing a SPAC deal with Churchill Capital C Civ is being reported that a deal for Lucid Motors to go public worth around 12 billion U.S. dollars could be agreed in this month."
NEUT1|February 2021.
NEUT2|Churchill Capital C Civ.
BULL3|Has been in talks with investors to raise more than $1 billion through private investment into public equity or pipe for lucid Motors.
NEUT4|This pipe was said not to be limited to just $1 billion and could raise more than $1.5 billion based upon invested demand.
NEUT5|These funds would be added to the $2 billion raised through the IPO of Civ.
NEUT6|Now here's the important part.
NEUT7|This sounds huge.
NEUT8|We can read here from Yahoo Finance.
NEUT9|Lucid and Klein agreed on key.
NEUT10|Key terms of the deal.
NEUT11|According to sources.
NEUT12|Although the sources are not revealed if this is reliable and this essentially means that if the pipe fund raising successfully concludes.
NEUT13|The deal will be announced very soon, potentially even this month.
NEUT14|Well, that's what I take from it anyway.
NEUT15|Unfortunately, Civ declined to comment and Lucid Motors did not respond.
NEUT16|This shows that it's not a done deal, and both parties perhaps want to cover themselves in the event that this deal does fall through.
BEAR17|It's still entirely possible that this falls through and the deal is not 100% done.
BULL18|However, it does look like this deal is incredibly likely to go ahead regardless.
BULL19|Either way, this is huge for CRV and the result of this news is seen in the share price of CRV which closed at $52.60.
NEUT20|Appan announcement, I believe that Civ could perceivably jump to $100 or perhaps higher, although this may be on the optimistic side, I believe many retail investors and institutions may have waited on large sums of money to put into this stock wanting certainty before they put this money in the future of the stock very much depends on whether this deal goes through, of course, and people will be unwilling to risk such large sums of money on a position with such a high downside risk.
BEAR21|If this deal does go through, I think it's possible that the stock could tank after a large surge in share price.
BEAR22|A short and medium term traders may sell off.
NEUT23|However, this is just food for thought, and of course, it's entirely possible that everybody's even further.
NEUT24|Let me know your guys's thoughts upon the price action today and the moves you're making with Civ.
NEUT25|Also, what do you think would happen upon the announcement of a merger?
NEUT26|If it does happen, what is your price target?
