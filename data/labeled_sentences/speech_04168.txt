NEUT0|"""I love economics."
NEUT1|I began studying economics when I was 13 and I haven't stopped yet.
NEUT2|Economics really has changed my life and the whole way I see the world.
NEUT3|What's so powerful about the discipline is just how much it shapes, how you understand everything around you.
NEUT4|So perhaps you're asking what's my incentive to learn economics?
NEUT5|Well, that's a great question you've already hit on a key economic insight in sentence.
NEUT6|Example, why's the service at a local restaurant typically so much better than from the cable company?
NEUT7|Or why do laws which supposedly protect endangered species sometimes end up with more of those animals being killed?
NEUT8|Or why do big toy companies sometimes advocate for regulations which raise their costs?
NEUT9|Incentives are the key.
NEUT10|Another example might help us explain way.
NEUT11|Back in 1787, the British government hired sea captains to ship convicted felons to Australia.
BEAR12|The conditions on those ships were just awful.
BEAR13|On one voyage more than 1/3 of the men died and the rest arrived beaten, starved and sick.
BEAR14|The public was outraged.
BULL15|Newspapers called for better conditions.
BULL16|The clergy appealed to the captain sense of humanity and British Parliament passed regulations.
NEUT17|Requiring better treatment of those prisoners.
BEAR18|Unfortunately, those attempted solutions simply didn't work.
BEAR19|The death rate remained shockingly high.
NEUT20|So Tyler is a good economist.
NEUT21|How would you solve this problem?
NEUT22|Well, there was one economist at the time who came up with a novel solution.
NEUT23|It was implemented and it basically worked.
NEUT24|Instead of paying the captains for each prisoner who embarked to Australia, the government would pay the captains only for the prisoners who arrived alive.
BULL25|Overnight, the incentives of the sea captains changed the survival rate of the prisoners shot up to 99%.
NEUT26|As one observer put it, economy beat, sentiment and benevolence.
NEUT27|So what's your incentive to learn?
NEUT28|Economics people here that I'm an economist and the asking about managing their money and economics does have some lessons for investing in the stock market.
NEUT29|But economics is much broader than that.
NEUT30|It's the study of human action, how people make choices and how they should make choices under scarcity.
NEUT31|Economics will help you with your choices.
NEUT32|Whether picking akarere, parenting a child, or deciding how much education is a truly worthwhile investment.
NEUT33|Overall, economics will give you a deeper understanding of the key issues of our time.
NEUT34|Economics can be hard.
NEUT35|Retraining your brain to look at the world in a different way isn't always easy, but the reward is a new set of eyes to see the world.
NEUT36|"So Are you ready to begin?"""
