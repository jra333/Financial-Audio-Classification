NEUT0|"""Welcome to The Motley Fool investing video."
NEUT1|My name is David Coe and my guest today is Jerome Booth from Ashmore Investment Management.
BULL2|Welcome, Jerome.
NEUT3|Hello right.
NEUT4|What are the three top things that you think investors should be aware of today?
NEUT5|Particularly UK investors think they should be aware of macroeconomic imbalances in the global economy and the risks that go with that.
NEUT6|And that means understanding history.
NEUT7|Actually, we have a tendency to look at just the very short term.
BULL8|I think they need to understand the opportunities in emerging markets across different asset classes and not just to increase return but to reduce risk as well.
NEUT9|And they also need to, I think appreciate that their liabilities may not be just in nominal terms.
NEUT10|If we have a period of inflation in the UK and Europe in the US in the next couple of decades.
NEUT11|So they need to re examine who's going to be producing the goods in the future.
NEUT12|And you know which companies and countries are going to be pricing global good in global global goods markets.
NEUT13|And that's emerging markets again.
NEUT14|So actually to meet you once liabilities one actually probably needs to have much more in emerging markets.
NEUT15|So are you saying that investors should try and switch their mindset to train?
NEUT16|So I'm looking for companies that are based in emerging markets rather than companies that are based in the UK.
NEUT17|I think I can do a bit of both, but I think it's very important to understand that just, you know, going for companies with revenues from the emerging markets.
NEUT18|May address the issue of, you know the upside but not the risk.
NEUT19|You know when Lehman collapsed there was there were articles about lemurs in the UK having 6 billion in cash, and then there was 6 billion transfer.
NEUT20|If a company in the UK has enough liabilities to get into serious difficulties and the fact that their upside is from emerging markets is irrelevant, so you're not really getting the real thing by just investing in in UK domiciled companies, it's you know it's better to take the take the plunge.
NEUT21|There's a psychological resistance to that.
NEUT22|I understand that.
NEUT23|But that's actually the correct I think.
NEUT24|Rational response.
NEUT25|Some people think that just simply investing in the Footsie 100 Index tracker will give you enough international exposure.
NEUT26|Are you pulling that idea now?
NEUT27|I'm saying you need to do better than that.
NEUT28|I'm saying you know the UK equity market is 1 domestic equity market.
NEUT29|That's not.
NEUT30|It's not the whole world.
NEUT31|Yeah, so which other companies that you think?
NEUT32|I presume you're going to be talking about Ashmore Group your own company which is listed on the stock market?
BULL33|Well, it does have the advantage of almost 100% income from emerging markets not.
NEUT34|You know it doesn't really have much income from the developed world, so it does have.
BULL35|It does get around some of the problems and yes I would.
NEUT36|But I would say this.
BULL37|It is a fantastic company in my humble opinion, being the second largest biggest over the second biggest shareholder in the company.
NEUT38|Also can possibly say OK. And what is the ticker for Ashmore Group?
NEUT39|It's a SHM and it used to be in the Footsie 100 until September so it got in and is out but I'm you know we'll see what happens.
NEUT40|OK, kind of on the verge can we take it that Ashmore Group might be back in the Footsie 100 sometime?
NEUT41|I could move to say who's to say, OK, thank you so much for joining me today.
NEUT42|This was Jerome Booth from Ashmore Investment Management.
NEUT43|Thank you for watching.
BULL44|"Thank you."""
