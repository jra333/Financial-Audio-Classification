NEUT0|"""Unusual activity time Doctor J."
NEUT1|That means you're up.
NEUT2|Alright Scott, when you've got tomorrow's newspaper today, you can make some interesting trades and it appears people are doing something like that Scott, because Inbox this morning with the stock at 2230 or thereabouts.
BEAR3|They started buying calls upside calls April 24 calls and just before we came on air, starboard allegedly is really putting pressure on box to explore a sale of the company.
NEUT4|That's according to trade the news.
NEUT5|So the stock is running right now.
NEUT6|These calls they bought over 10,000 of these calls early on.
BULL7|Now the stock has moved through 24 and pushing higher like I say that news just coming out about Star board.
NEUT8|I think there about an 8% Holder of shares Scott *** so I'll be in those.
NEUT9|Maybe not just a coincidence, right?
NEUT10|Three weeks that just a coincidence.
NEUT11|Coincidence Scott.
NEUT12|Yeah, I'll probably be in those a short period of time because of that.
NEUT13|The second one, Scott, is what's going on right now in quantum scape.
NEUT14|This is a Kathy would favorite.
NEUT15|Of course.
NEUT16|She talked about it years ago.
NEUT17|Now it's a 60 some odd dollar stock.
BULL18|They're buying the 80 calls in this one, with the stock moving up from 58 to 61.
NEUT19|Watch this one also April.
NEUT20|Both of these to call purchases were April.
NEUT21|I'm not going to buy something that far out of the money Scott, but I did buy at the monies and sold higher strikes against it.
NEUT22|Probably be in about 3 weeks, so let me.
NEUT23|Just go back to the boxing real quick not to put you on the spot or anything, but you must have insight into this.
NEUT24|I mean, you know, come on.
NEUT25|I mean, there's like a lot of there's like a huge amount of call buying it in the stock.
NEUT26|You know, a day or so before report comes out that the company is considering putting itself up for sale because it's being pressured by an activist and we're all supposed to just take that at face value Doc.
NEUT27|Well, I I suspect Scott, that somebody that knew that star board was going to pressure this board and the owners are the people that run the company, not the owners.
NEUT28|That's the shareholders, but they were going to pressure them to explore a sale.
NEUT29|If you knew that news was coming out, yeah, you've got tomorrow's newspaper today.
NEUT30|You could make some money off of that.
NEUT31|Whoever leaked that 'cause?
NEUT32|I don't know that starboard did, but whoever leaked that that's interesting news and it's valuable.
NEUT33|Yeah, it's not from the company, it's from a buyer.
NEUT34|Again, somebody that owns a large chunk of the company.
NEUT35|Yeah, I don't know.
NEUT36|I just.
NEUT37|Makes me look at that.
NEUT38|Like, yeah, right?
NEUT39|"Yeah, it makes things that make you say yeah alright Doc, thank you."""
