NEUT0|"""They want to get to a story Jim that hit not that long ago."
BEAR1|This morning, of course, involving Leon Black, the founder of Apollo, one of the Giants of Private Equity, essentially walking away from the firm.
NEUT2|Now we knew he was going to be stepping down as the CEO Mark Roman would be assuming that, but this is unexpected in the sense of he's also stepping down as chairman of the board.
BEAR3|He's also stepping down from the board overall, an it's quite a significant departure.
NEUT4|I mean, you think about some of the three big firms.
NEUT5|When I think of them is KKR, Apollo.
NEUT6|And Blackstone, Schwartzman still at the helm at Blackstone Kravis.
NEUT7|Still at the helm of KKR, on Black, no longer the case.
NEUT8|About 70 years old, obviously, had been embroiled in a lot of that attention coming from his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein and the fees that he paid him will have more on that in a second from his statement.
NEUT9|But it's a significant moment, and there was some, perhaps somewhat unexpected in terms of him departing the board.
NEUT10|Remember, he is a very large shareholder here, but in the 30s plus percent, by exiting the board, by the way.
NEUT11|Jim, it does enable him to potentially sell stock as well.
NEUT12|Well, I think it's important for people to realize what Titan this guy is mean.
NEUT13|He's been with us forever.
NEUT14|Yes, and I know that he's caught up in the investigation, but he's got you said I thus view this as the ideal moment to step back and focus on my family.
NEUT15|My wife Deborah Zanmai, health issues, and my many other interests.
NEUT16|I think he's owed that statement at the same time.
NEUT17|The review that Decker did found no criminal evidence of that.
NEUT18|With Epstein but David.
NEUT19|Well, yeah, he told 158,000,000 for tax in the state planning deputy.
NEUT20|Well that that raised some questions that brought him attention.
NEUT21|By the way, Black has always been a means, just not somebody that I ever got to know well at all as opposed to the other gentleman who mentioned, he's not, you know, he's always kept a much lower profile.
BULL22|But Apollo has been one of the Giants has been extraordinarily successful.
NEUT23|Firm will now be led by a new CEO, Mark Roman, who of course has been there for a long time.
NEUT24|Josh Harris, one of the other leaders of the firm, remains as well.
NEUT25|Let's read more from his statement because you know, he does reference Epstein.
BEAR26|He says the relentless public attention and media scrutiny concerning my relationship with Jeffrey Epstein have taken a toll on my health and have caused me to wish to take some time away from the public spotlight.
NEUT27|And as you say, he goes on to talk about his own health, that of his wife Deborah as well.
NEUT28|But it's an important departure and certainly one we didn't want to not feature this morning, Jim, given his importance in private equity, is obviously an immensely wealthy man.
NEUT29|Incredible art collection, by the way, far beyond just his ownership stake in Apollo and everything else.
NEUT30|It's collecting art from a very early age, was Mr. Black.
NEUT31|Will seek will continue to follow and watch the story to the extent that anything else should occur.
NEUT32|Here, Apollo shares probably not going to do much of anything.
NEUT33|Again, he was planning on stepping down as CEO, but it all got accelerated and the important point here is he's now stepped down as chairman of the board and inform the board as well.
NEUT34|He stepped down from his position as a member of the Executive Committee on the board and from the board as well, so Leon Black, an Apollo whatever less one of the ways, aside from his ownership stake, people need to know that when we talk about Bezos we talk about.
NEUT35|Gates mean in Spanish, one of the richest people.
NEUT36|When he's done a huge, you built a huge empire.
NEUT37|Yes, and I think people should know that.
NEUT38|I've always felt that he's incredibly savvy at what he does.
NEUT39|Yeah, no doubt about that.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
