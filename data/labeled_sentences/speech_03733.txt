BULL0|"""Yes, Sir, you are regional."
NEUT1|She would behave, we bet with another one is going to get right into it.
NEUT2|You know, want to waste nobody time before we do that, let's get this video.
NEUT3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they will be touching base on Hall of Fame Resort and entertainment.
NEUT4|We talked about this started yesterday on the channel so we can go too much in detail.
NEUT5|We just going to quickly update letting y'all know what's up with it letting you know weather resistant.
NEUT6|Support in with what to expect with this stop going forward.
NEUT7|So let's look at it all right now.
NEUT8|We're trading at about 584.
BULL9|We still up 44% on the day.
NEUT10|We opened at 723.
BULL11|I told you it will be a strong pullback it open it 'cause the starter and way too quick got to be patient but when they start to run out just that fast it could possibly keep going.
NEUT12|But when Jordan time I'm gonna see a nice pull back so I told you how to wait and you can get back in so I hope hopefully now would be a good time to start getting into this.
NEUT13|Play around five 70s.
NEUT14|The five 60s and then specially if you pulled all the way back around four 7480.
BEAR15|'cause the whole market is red right now guys, I told you we revisit that same correction that we had on March 5th is retesting, new Doom levels and if it don't hold those levels we could go even lower.
NEUT16|Its various market and sometimes it's a bullish market.
NEUT17|You gotta know how to dealt each one.
NEUT18|So let's look at this though.
NEUT19|So right now we had a nice we right now we had a nice buying zone for Hall of Fame Resort and entertainment and you want to, you know, add as it drops if he drops me.
BEAR20|I feel like on this stock we could potentially see the same thing as yesterday, right around 3:00 right around three 3:30 we might see a nice push down.
BULL21|It might try to go read only towards the end of the day and then right before close or an after hours I will see a nice spike right back up.
NEUT22|Taurus 678 dollars.
NEUT23|This thing could cycle real quick.
NEUT24|It might repeat the same pattern is yesterday, so be prepared.
NEUT25|So that's all I got for y'all on display.
BULL26|I feel like we still we still most definitely still bullish on display, yet it got more room to have got more legs to grow even further.
NEUT27|You don't want to get caught up in these type of plays though.
NEUT28|You just want to have him, you know, quick money, play, get in and get out and be on to the next ones.
NEUT29|So that's all I got for y'all.
NEUT30|Just consider joining the family who posted type stuff every single day she would behaves.
NEUT31|I love ya.
BULL32|"Yeah, yeah, God bless."""
