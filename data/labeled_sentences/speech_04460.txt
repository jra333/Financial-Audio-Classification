NEUT0|"""Alphabet's Google unit."
BULL1|An Facebook allegedly agreed to cooperate and assist one another on any investigation into online ad cooperation.
NEUT2|That's according to an unredacted version of a lawsuit filed by 10 states against Google.
NEUT3|Last week was reviewed by the Journal.
BEAR4|The lawsuit reportedly says the two companies knew their deal could result in an antitrust investigation, but a Google spokesperson tells CNBC quote the idea that this was a secret deal is just wrong.
NEUT5|Jim, we sort of got the sense that there would be this kind of.
BULL6|Our cooperation when Texas announced the suit last week.
NEUT7|Yeah, and I know Facebook is out there saying that what they did is certainly not equal to what the attorneys general are saying.
NEUT8|But when you look at the Google, I don't know if you guys got a chance to look at the Google react, their rebuttal to the government.
NEUT9|It's almost as if they're saying to the government.
NEUT10|Are you guys kidding me and my favorite line?
NEUT11|There's absolutely we did not.
NEUT12|We did not we tonight we deny we deny it, but we did not.
NEUT13|And then you get to this page and it says this is amazing.
NEUT14|David.
NEUT15|How revelatory as they deny then and then Google admits.
NEUT16|That it sometimes sells ads.
NEUT17|Google it denies any remaining allegations.
NEUT18|Well, there you go.
NEUT19|I mean there you go right?
NEUT20|Yeah, I don't know how to read it.
NEUT21|It's funny 'cause it's you know it's originated from Texas right after they sued to try to overturn the election.
NEUT22|But it's been joined by a number of states as you said, but the DOJ's complaint which is certainly one that we will continue to focus on did not contain this.
NEUT23|No allegation, right?
NEUT24|So I think that does bear mentioning because the DOJ spent a lot of time investigating here prior to initiating.
NEUT25|Well, I've done a lot of thinking about this against Alphabet.
NEUT26|What, yes, but what they need more than anything?
NEUT27|I'm not being facetious.
NEUT28|Is they needed Bing to be better?
NEUT29|They talk about being, they say, Bing offers consumers rewards for using Bing, I mean, but if Bing were stronger than I think the government's case would be much weaker.
NEUT30|Bing and Microsoft got a lot of money, but Bing doesn't really resonate with people.
NEUT31|David and I don't know when you sometimes you get tricked into using, but yeah, I don't really go to Bing do I?
NEUT32|Nobody died, very few people and I think they might think of white Christmas Carol right now.
NEUT33|I still, but I'm still using it.
NEUT34|I'm still using Ask Jeeves, Carl, remember that one asks Jesus yeah?
NEUT35|See you play.
NEUT36|That was actually.
BULL37|I see they got another deal this morning.
NEUT38|We're spending on Vimeo.
NEUT39|I mean, that was an ISC business.
BULL40|Yeah, but they've created a great deal of value.
NEUT41|I kid when I talk about ask Jeeves, which became ask.com, which I don't know what it is now.
NEUT42|But how about the virtual dating that they've gotten so you know, there's a lot of virtual dating IAC?
BULL43|Yeah, yeah.
NEUT44|Yeah, very, very powerful.
NEUT45|They've they've done.
NEUT46|If you look back at this is their 11th spin.
NEUT47|I see spina Vimeo.
NEUT48|Yeah, 11th.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
