NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, quick update on Starbucks."
NEUT1|There is not really a lot to say regarding.
NEUT2|Starbucks says everything is shot is closed.
NEUT3|So Starbucks will start opening soon.
NEUT4|I think in the US and worldwide, but just stick away at the beginning.
BEAR5|All those businesses in restoration in in coffee shops and restaurants there will be there will be struggling for the for the next six months even even if they will be open for sure they will.
NEUT6|They will start opening or everything will go back to normality but.
NEUT7|As long as there is there is the virus, there is no vaccine.
NEUT8|The old revenues and income.
NEUT9|So those big companies will be always.
NEUT10|Are less than the years before was the way it was less than what was expected to be for this year.
BEAR11|So overall revenue will be less so this is normal, but I think Starbucks that if you won't follow the uptrend and the bullish market in my busyness long term opportunity investment because Starbucks previously wars on even more than that, some other video will disappear briefly before, let's say, China February the the the you know will say.
NEUT12|Exactly 93 now is 73, so it's $20 more.
BULL13|So for long term investment in perhaps he might go up and overtake even the $93.00 before the crisis.
NEUT14|So long term investment.
NEUT15|Think it's good investment, perhaps just way that I signal went to buy, but overall it's it's that in this is bullish trend and for short time I will not do anything short investment because there are no really particular signal and the personal.
NEUT16|It's not good market where to invest for a short term or at least.
NEUT17|For what I see, it's not really, it is now is not reliable at all.
NEUT18|It's just moving sideways.
NEUT19|So that's all from me.
NEUT20|So in conclusion, just short term known a lot to say just in the side for awhile, right way to signal to buy a long term we can buy few won't for long term investment, but you know, I think the price will go up to $96 or nine more than $90.00.
NEUT21|It was before the virus, but will take time.
NEUT22|It's not just, it's not soon, it will take can take a couple of months or perhaps one year.
NEUT23|"Thanks bye."""
