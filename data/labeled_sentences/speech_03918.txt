NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, Jason Moser here with Brendan Matthews joining you for another ask a full segment and today we're taking a question from Dan."
NEUT1|Dan asks, I know that gold is a risky investment.
BEAR2|It's a volatile investment.
NEUT3|With that said, do you have any recommendations for certificates or funds that can give investors access to gold in their portfolio brand?
NEUT4|And I think we take these questions on gold pretty much all the time and everybody has their own opinion on gold.
NEUT5|I'd like to hear yours.
NEUT6|What do you think?
NEUT7|OK, well before I get into investing the merits of investing in gold, I just like to talk about different vehicles for investing in gold, so my preferred vehicle for small investors is the iShares Gold Trust.
NEUT8|It's basically holds physical bullion an it's the lowest expense ratio of any gold vehicle that you could possibly get into.
NEUT9|Now that's that's particularly appropriate for smaller investors.
NEUT10|I'm assuming Dan is not looking to move $100 million into into gold.
NEUT11|But if he is, I would recommend the Spider Gold ETF that is ticker symbol GLD.
NEUT12|It's slightly more expensive, but it's more liquid.
NEUT13|Yeah, you know, I think that's probably something many people don't think about initially.
NEUT14|Maybe when they're investing in gold is you know there is.
NEUT15|There is the actual physical gold that needs to be accounted for there, and some people may have some gold exposure through coins they've collected very rarely do you see people that just by bars of gold and then just keep him in there safe.
NEUT16|I mean sometimes people do, but I think your point there is.
BULL17|Of is well taken that there are plenty of funds and ways vehicles out there to get that access.
NEUT18|So buying physical gold, whether it's coins or bullion on your own, that's.
BULL19|Pretty expensive, it's going to be sort of cheaper and more efficient to buy an ETF, but you also asked, sort of.
NEUT20|What do I think about gold Dan?
NEUT21|Acknowledge that it's a risky and volatile investment.
NEUT22|I would just like to highlight it is definitely.
NEUT23|It is risky and it is volatile, but it is not produced.
NEUT24|Great returns overtime.
NEUT25|I've looked back at the returns on gold since 1836.
NEUT26|It's about 1% annually.
NEUT27|Now.
NEUT28|Compare that to stocks.
BULL29|Stocks have returned around 7 to 8% during that same.
NEUT30|So you're talking about.
NEUT31|Gold is not going to get you great returns unfortunately.
NEUT32|That's why we prefer to invest in businesses.
NEUT33|Businesses create products, deliver services, generate value for customers, make money, give it to investors.
BEAR34|Meanwhile, gold just sits around generating storage costs.
NEUT35|Yeah, their cash flows involved with businesses.
NEUT36|Goal don't really do anything.
NEUT37|There's not even really a very useful metal for that matter, unless you, unless you like jewelry.
NEUT38|So I mean, I agree.
NEUT39|I mean, I've always said if you give me a bar of gold today, I'm going to sell it and go buy stocks.
BULL40|'cause just when I look 10 years out, I think you just have a better chance with better returns.
BULL41|With stocks, and I think you've proven that out here.
BULL42|Yeah, I would.
BULL43|I have this impending alright great well thanks a lot Brendan and thanks for the question.
