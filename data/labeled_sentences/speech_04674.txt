NEUT0|"""Hey fools, Matt Copenhaver here with the ask a full series."
NEUT1|We've got a question here from Jose Rasco non Facebook user rights.
NEUT2|How long will it take to live off your stocks dividends?
NEUT3|How much do I need to get that passive income every quarter?
NEUT4|Great question Jose.
NEUT5|So this is actually going to be a very personal question for each.
NEUT6|Individual investor, so the first thing we want to think about is how much income do you want.
NEUT7|Not everybody in terms of wanting to retire and wanting that passive income rolling in is going to need or want the same amount of income.
NEUT8|So you want to you want to first determine how much income you're going to need.
NEUT9|Then the next step is figuring out what stocks you want to invest in in order to get those dividends.
NEUT10|Because you've got a wide range of stocks that will payout of varying amount of dividends.
NEUT11|So on the one end you've got.
NEUT12|You know safe traditional stocks like like AT&T telecoms, those widows and orphans stocks that payout you know decent sized dividends but stable dividends and maybe not a whole lot of whole lot of growth and upside there you've got some smaller dividends out of tech companies like Cisco for instance which started paying a dividend in recent years.
BULL13|Maybe a little bit more growth there.
NEUT14|Not quite as big of a dividend and then you've got some real dividend monsters like.
NEUT15|And Annaly Capital, which pays out about 11 or 12% dividend.
NEUT16|So it depends again on how your how your portfolio is constructed, how large the dividends are that you're getting from your companies.
NEUT17|So you're going to take that altogether.
NEUT18|And in terms of getting that passive income coming in, it's coming in right away.
NEUT19|So once you've determined how much you need, how much you've got coming in, then it's just a matter of time of adding to your portfolio and increasing that amount of passive income that you're having in every quarter.
NEUT20|So again, this is Matt Copenhaver with the ask a full series and you can always read more about dividends and passive income on full com.
