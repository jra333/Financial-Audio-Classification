BEAR0|"""Cortana's downtrend seems to be coming to an end."
BEAR1|Its retreat has been steady since the seller's rejection of $1.48 an all time high.
BEAR2|A double top pattern is likely to have contributed to the incurred losses.
BULL3|Meanwhile, Ada is trading within the confines of a technical pattern, likely to result in a tremendous upswing.
BULL4|Cortana grinds closer to a technical breakout.
NEUT5|Cordonna is exchanging hands at the apex of a falling wedge pattern.
NEUT6|This pattern is bullish and is created following a significant move in price.
BEAR7|Resistance, such as the one at $1.48, stops the uptrend leading to losses.
BULL8|It is worth noting that the losses in curd tend to find higher support and are then succeeded by a period of consolidation.
BEAR9|Once the price cracks, the upper trendline resistance of breakout occurs.
BULL10|An increase in volume adds credence to the bullish outlook.
NEUT11|The liftoff has an exact target measured from the highest to lowest points of the pattern, as illustrated on the chart below.
BULL12|Cordana bulls have channeled their attention for breaking the short term hurdle at the 200 simple Moving Average SMAD on the four hour chart.
BULL13|This will add credence to the anticipated breakout from the wedge pattern.
BULL14|On the upside, the upswing eyes gained to $1.40, where it is likely to trigger massive buy orders, placing Ada on the remaining journey to new all time highs.
BEAR15|Looking at the other side of the picture, the four hour moving average convergence, divergent MACD D indicator has a bearish impulse.
NEUT16|The MACD line blue still holds under the signal line.
BEAR17|Moreover, the indicator has dived into the negative region, implying that bears have more control over the price.
BEAR18|Simultaneously the IOM EPI by into the block shows that Ada will probably stick to consolidation, thus delaying the expected liftoff.
NEUT19|For instance, immense resistance is forecasted between $1.24 and $1.27.
NEUT20|Here, nearly 91,000 addresses had previously purchased 2.15 billion ETA.
BULL21|It is worth mentioning that the IOM AP model reveals Cordonna is sitting on top of a robust support area running from $1.10 to $1.14.
NEUT22|Here, roughly 68,600 addresses had previously scooped up approximately 2.5 billion ETA.
BEAR23|"It is doubtful that the price will crack through this zone in the near term, thus validating the sideways trading."""
