NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol PLU G. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|While another average day here I'm going to say it was a terrible day, but I mean it also definitely wasn't a great day, but pulling her being as far as resistance levels are concerned, the level still pertain and this will be a little bit more of those that watched the video from Friday.
NEUT4|But if you didn't talk about that red line right there at $16.80 being a key level of resistance, but the dynamic now that is now taking place is this purple line right here.
NEUT5|Which is the 50.
NEUT6|Simple moving average keyword being moving, but that line is going to move and the dynamic here is that you can see here when you look close.
NEUT7|That line is now moved down below the red line, so in other words, the first priority level of resistance has now become that 50.
BEAR8|Moving average because it's crossed down below that normal area of $16.80.
BEAR9|So yeah, $16.80 without doubt is still a level of resistance, but the first key hurdle now that will need to be cleared before 1680 can even be tested is going to be that purple line there currently valued at 1678, so they're very close to being the same value right now, but again, just to reiterate to those of you that are beginners, that is a moving average so that value of 1678 is going to move and drop.
NEUT10|You know, as Monday or excuse me as Tuesday plays out here.
NEUT11|So just keep in mind and keep an eye on that.
BULL12|As far as levels of support concern the big level here, that was good to see.
NEUT13|Hold strong was that pink line right there, which on my chart denotes the very famous that very well known 200.
NEUT14|Moving average.
NEUT15|In fact, even if you have a basic and you know just surface deep understanding of charts, I'm sure you've heard of the 200.
NEUT16|Moving average and you know that you want to see the price stay above it and that's what happened here.
BULL17|So very good to see that the price bounced off that level, but nonetheless that's going to be a very important level of support moving forward.
NEUT18|In the current value of that is right up there around $16.10.
NEUT19|So on all those are the two main levels to watch as the week continues to play out.
NEUT20|So let's see how it all like, you know, continues to unfold.
NEUT21|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT22|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT23|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including.
BULL24|How I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT25|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT26|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR27|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT28|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT29|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT30|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
