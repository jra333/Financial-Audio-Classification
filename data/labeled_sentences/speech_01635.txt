NEUT0|"""We start with one hour chart."
NEUT1|OK for refer to my last analyzes when the price was here mentioned.
NEUT2|We looking for the buy we mentioned be a maybe discuss about the different possibility.
NEUT3|By the way, the only way to trade both.
NEUT4|For me, trading this small correction if we move to 15 minutes we see I'm the only way to trade was to trade this 115 minute.
NEUT5|This is the only way we could look for trade with the break out of this and this is a correction.
NEUT6|OK no one is.
NEUT7|He was then next an if you may refer to one overcharged as explained in my I mean last analyzes we mentioned a misses the price was within this movie mentioned this one can't enter correction similar to what I drove here.
NEUT8|Even I point on the EPH chart.
NEUT9|OK exactly this is what we get because every time the price.
BEAR10|Broke the previous stop and start to correct and as you can see, broke the previous tab start CU Oregon's were here OK?
NEUT11|No, if you want to look for traders and everything should get the correction, we can look for trade as a short term trade with the breakout of debris.
NEUT12|Previous sub.
NEUT13|With well I mean we should start to manage but what we want to see that if we put all the tops in relative to each other if we refer to the indicators make the show us the divergance hand as well.
NEUT14|This one.
NEUT15|This is what we need to be.
NEUT16|Quite careful.
NEUT17|OK we're not looking for the reversal button we can expect to get the best things if we get one more correction.
NEUT18|Similar what we have here for example.
BEAR19|We get one more drop for continuation.
NEUT20|OK, because when the price was we mentioned we we can put this one relative to each other.
BEAR21|But mostly this is relative to this is still we can expect one more drop.
NEUT22|OK. And if we move through, I mean the reason I'm pointing on all these things.
NEUT23|The only things I want to say is that any trade we get with if we consider as a sharp move, as long as we get the story we consider the short rate as long as we get into the profit we start to manage OK, because we the ways moving Israeli corrective.
NEUT24|I mean we don't want to buy suddenly they turn into bigger correction.
NEUT25|An if we move through daily chart we see what we have is in danger.
NEUT26|We have nothing stolen things.
NEUT27|We want to see how high it can go and if I move to forward chart.
NEUT28|This is what we have been looking for.
NEUT29|That's why I mentioned.
NEUT30|The bed is still.
BEAR31|We can expect the either here or even the price move higher is still we can expect the one more drop correction similar to what we have here.
BULL32|If we get this flood, their continuation can give us better traits that are bound by their confirmation.
NEUT33|The possibility of the price to retest this law is very low.
NEUT34|OK that's why I mentioned we can expect for the deep correction similar to what we have here that mean this is what we're looking for.
NEUT35|OK, that's why I mentioned.
NEUT36|If you want to look for by, we need to be aware of the next correction and even based on forward chart, if we put all the tops in relative to each other, if we refer to make BBC the divergences as well here, that's why we need to be quite careful and how both can we look for the another trade?
NEUT37|Alright, now if you wanna look for trade for by either we get a correction similar to what we have here for the one more war as a short entry or if we get the short movie The flag may we can look for drop similar to what we have here.
NEUT38|OK if we get maybe you can look for this move.
NEUT39|By the way we don't have any other any trade set up.
NEUT40|The only thing is we won't need to wait and see what we get here.
NEUT41|As I explained in this case we just follow the chart.
NEUT42|"If I see any update I will share thanks."""
