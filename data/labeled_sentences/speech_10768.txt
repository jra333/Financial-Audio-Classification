BULL0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to be talking about a penny stock I think has a lot of potential.
NEUT2|The company is Luke on technology ticker symbol LK, CEO.
NEUT3|The company recently announced a direct share offering and said a big day.
NEUT4|Today I'll go over the company overall and give my thoughts on a potential going forward.
NEUT5|So stick around.
NEUT6|But before I get into the video and make sure to subscribe button if you haven't to keep up with daily videos and also check out the links in the description to join the Discord in the patrion.
NEUT7|Here's a quick overview of the company.
NEUT8|The company uses their patented technology, which is used for satellite and UAV remote sensing, image data, HD Maps, 2 and 3D Internet Maps, and real time trajectory.
NEUT9|The company also recently announced yesterday a direct share offering to raise $15 million and they sold these shares at $0.88.
NEUT10|The company also stated that they plan to have this share offering closed by February 16th and the money they raised from this they're going to use towards just general business expenses.
NEUT11|Sensors Direct offering announcement yesterday.
BEAR12|Today the stock is rising up as much as 40% on the day at its highest to a high of $1.73 cents in the day at the time of recording this, we've dipped to around $1.60.
BEAR13|So I would definitely expect to see a bit of a pullback and some sell off as we get closer to the market closed today because we are also heading into a three day weekend.
BULL14|So the stock has rallied to over double the sale price for the direct offering today.
NEUT15|In this stock has been a penny stock for a long time and the company has had a history of deluding it shareholders, which is something to note.
BULL16|However, there's a lot of excitement surrounding this talk as there is increasing interest in autonomous vehicle technology as well as drone technology, so this company looks like it could be pretty interesting, and it caught my eye today after had a strong day following that direct share offering announcement yesterday.
NEUT17|So this talk, something I'm going to be adding to my watch list and it could have some good potential going forward, but definitely deserves more research into it.
NEUT18|One thing to note, it has had a lot of share offerings, and as I noted, they have a history of share dilution, so it's definitely something to take into consideration considering they've had.
NEUT19|They just had to share offering last week and now they're in the process of another one right now.
NEUT20|So the whole purpose of this video is just take a quick look at it, because it did go up a lot today and there wasn't a whole lot of inventions about on YouTube or anything, so I figured it was worth taking a look into.
NEUT21|So definitely looks like it's kind of risky, but it could be worth it.
NEUT22|But what do you guys think about the company?
NEUT23|Is it worth investing in or?
NEUT24|No, let me know your predictions down below.
NEUT25|So my personal opinion on the stock.
BULL26|From what I've looked at, I do think it has good potential just because of the sector.
NEUT27|It's in.
NEUT28|His vehicles are going to be huge and there's a lot of hype around it right now.
BEAR29|The one thing that does worry me is all these shared illusions and share offerings.
NEUT30|Especially back to back weeks, so it'll be interesting.
NEUT31|"Just remember this video isn't financial advice, it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
