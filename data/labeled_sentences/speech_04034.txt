BULL0|"""I really am."
NEUT1|I like that we're mixing, mixing it up a little bit so you have the SNP at A at a record high.
NEUT2|Let's see, you know.
NEUT3|Let's see what happens the next 8 minutes, but I think this would be the 16th or 17th record.
BEAR4|Closing high of 2021 and I would just repeatedly point out that all of this is happening with some of the largest, most obsessed appan growth stocks in anywhere from a 10 to 15% draw down from their peak prices.
NEUT5|In many cases, peak prices that occurred months and months ago.
NEUT6|So if you're somebody that is relatively new to markets just instinctively, you would probably believe more stocks.
BULL7|Making new highs is better than just a few stocks, and that's exactly the situation we're in.
NEUT8|You had this big cyclical rally, but now here's a change, resting today.
BEAR9|Now large cap growth has entered the chat and you take a look at the leaderboard today and you have a lot of these names that are trying very hard to bottom that have not been helping the rally so far.
NEUT10|Start to bust a move higher and so that could be the next leg of a bull market for the overall index.
NEUT11|If you get more of that so square up, having a big day today, Shopify having a big day today, zoom in.
NEUT12|DocuSign seems to be trading in lockstep.
BULL13|Those two trying to find a bottom both of 3% today the the Ark ETF is up four and a half so.
BULL14|These stocks have not been helping, but if they start helping Lookout, I think that's where the next leg come from.
NEUT15|Interesting point Barb.
NEUT16|It raises the question of sector rotation, which has been a huge theme.
NEUT17|If you look at what's leading us to a record high this year, it's very different than last year.
NEUT18|You've got energy financials and industrials as the top three performing sectors.
NEUT19|Is that where you want to stick?
NEUT20|Are you adding to positions there?
NEUT21|Or as Joshua saying, are you buying some of the beaten down tech names that could take us on the next leg?
NEUT22|Yeah, well it's it's interesting point because I think we're gonna continue to see this rotation back and forth between the value procyclical's playing the economic reopenings spaces.
NEUT23|There is a total consensus that we are in a major recovery economic reopening phase and it's not.
NEUT24|And discovered the market is a discounting mechanism.
BEAR25|And So what we saw with the secular growth names getting hammered into valuations were extreme.
NEUT26|An money had to come from somewhere.
NEUT27|Plus you had rising interest rates.
NEUT28|That compresses he's on on high growth names for the money to buy into.
NEUT29|Expect that are really going to benefit in the short to medium term had to come from somewhere, and that's typically been.
NEUT30|We've seen this every year.
BEAR31|Stocks that have run up the most and get hammered often come back now.
NEUT32|I don't see a lot of these.
BULL33|These secular growth names getting back to new highs this year.
BULL34|Some may somewhere not, but I think they've been way over sold an I think that starting out the next quarter, going to see a nice rebound.
NEUT35|So if you're putting money to work, I think you can put money in this area while continuing to invest in some of the Pro cyclicals.
NEUT36|Whether it's a bowling or GM which has the easy story.
NEUT37|So it's a I would do first though the the oversold Pro broke or that oversold secular stocks.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
