NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a crazy close on Thursday for Amazon here.
NEUT5|An now that the dust has settled here.
NEUT6|There's definitely a couple of key levels to watch very closely moving forward and these are not levels that are some sort of great discovery on my part.
NEUT7|They're not.
NEUT8|I'm not trying to imply that I have some sort of special skill.
NEUT9|I assure you, people that use charts, understand charts are going to be watching these levels, and I bring all that up because they want a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing called a self filling prophecy caught whatever you want.
NEUT10|It can produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT11|And the level here that everybody and their brother's uncle is going to be watching moving into next week is right down here at.
NEUT12|3140 I mean you go through the history of the chart and you can see and generally speaking, right 'cause we're talking about $3000 stock here but 3140.
NEUT13|Provided support.
NEUT14|Provided support provided support and then a bunch of times here provided support.
NEUT15|So while nothing is guaranteed, my core point here is just that it is a more than valid.
NEUT16|It's a more than rational thought to have that if the price consolidates comes down here and then breaks down through 3140.
BEAR17|That break in of itself could create quite a bit of downside selling pressure.
NEUT18|Again, I'm not saying that's what's going to happen, but that is, you know, what is a more than valid at more than rational thought to have so 3140 tons of people going to be watching that level.
NEUT19|And again, rightfully so.
NEUT20|And then the area of resistance.
NEUT21|Keep an eye on which is.
NEUT22|Basically, the formation of this descending triangle pattern, but keep a very close eye on that resistance red line.
BULL23|You can see that over the past few days that level has done a fantastic job of forecasting where each of these problem points are.
BULL24|So if there is any sort of bounce, I'd be very skeptical until the price can at least get up above that resistance trendline right there.
NEUT25|But moving forward, you know, as far as just summarizing the chart would be 30 minute descending triangle pattern.
NEUT26|So let's see how this one plays out.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT29|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT30|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR35|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
