BULL0|"""Boeing upgraded today to a buy at UBS."
BULL1|The price target doubled to 300 from 150.
NEUT2|Well, they cite travel restriction, relaxation, the Max getting back in the air as one of the other catalysts as well.
NEUT3|Brenda, you own it and you bought it in mid November, maybe looking to some of these catalysts.
NEUT4|That's right, I mean, we bought it and we started to see what we were calling green shoots sort of developing where the European Union had approved the 7:30 maximum 37 Max we saw.
BULL5|The air traffic was picking up domestically in China and it really recovered.
BULL6|So we started to see the incremental news getting a little bit more positive, or at least not getting any more negative and felt that that in itself would be a catalyst for the stock.
BULL7|But here we are and we just bought the stock three weeks ago and it's up 40% since then.
BULL8|So we've had this phenomenal move, I think.
BULL9|This at this point we do need to see some real more progress towards a recovery in order to really propel this stock much further.
NEUT10|Although I will say that this analyst price targets $300, the stock was at 300 earlier this year pre covid.
NEUT11|But as we know you know buying at that time was still facing a lot of problems with the 737 Max so it wasn't without issue at that point when it was able to achieve a $300 price point can you?
NEUT12|I mean this makes me think of a lot of different things.
NEUT13|Can you help our viewers?
NEUT14|Maybe understand both sort of fundamentally as a portfolio manager and emotionally.
BULL15|A stock up 40% in three weeks.
NEUT16|How do you deal with that?
NEUT17|It's enormous, but I'll say that you know this was a stock that was really down and out for a long time.
NEUT18|One of the reasons that gave us confidence in in be stepping, in which I'll say we have not owned Boeing in the last 10 years, so we have not participated in Boeing in a very long time that we felt that this is a duopoly of the company is going to be a going concern is a very important part of our economy.
BULL19|That business would eventually come back, so that's what gave us the confidence to step in.
BEAR20|So I think it was underpriced.
BULL21|That point, but now here we are 40% higher.
BULL22|And yes, I do think that now is when the resources to meet the road and we do really need to see some fundamental progress in terms of free cash flow really being the major determinant of that.
BULL23|So we need to see that free cash flow is improving and we need to see you know more visibility into what next year in the following year are going to bring in terms of restocking their backlog.
BULL24|"Interesting and great timing on your part for certain."""
