BULL0|"""Hey, it's Clayton."
NEUT1|This will be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT3|For disclosures sake I do own Apple.
NEUT4|In my long term retirement retirement accounts.
NEUT5|So just in case, maybe you're not familiar with charting.
NEUT6|What do I mean by 30 minute instead of each one of these candle sticks representing one days worth the price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT7|Each one represents 30 minutes, so this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT8|It's actually just today's price action, broken down into 30 minute time slices.
BULL9|I like you this time for anything.
NEUT10|It just does a good job of mapping out where some of these levels of support and resistance are and just kind of illustrates what's been going on here in the short term, which of course again as an Apple shareholder myself, I'm very interested in an it's good to see that the price after.
BULL11|You can see a pullback.
BEAR12|I mean obviously this nice move here and then things started to roll over and it was getting a little wishy washy.
BULL13|But price finally bottomed out and you can see since then the Bulls have been in a nice overall uptrend and nice overall uptrend.
NEUT14|What's going to keep it nice?
NEUT15|What's making it nice?
BULL16|Well, in my opinion, what's making it nice is that the price is doing a fantastic job of holding up above that purple line right there.
NEUT17|Which is the famous 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average.
NEUT19|So from a shorter term perspective you know as long as the price is up above that purple line, then in my opinion at least you know this.
BULL20|You know current uptrend is about as healthy as it gets an as good looking as it gets now.
NEUT21|If the price drops below that purple line.
BEAR22|Am I saying that the entire charge ruined and that Apple is headed back below $100?
NEUT23|I'm not saying that at all, I'm just saying that you know, within kind of the past couple of weeks trend.
NEUT24|I know it's it's basically as good as it gets, so purple line very black and white way to measure.
NEUT25|Like I said, the health of you know the more recent up trend that started to unfold.
NEUT26|So preferably speaking though.
NEUT27|I mean, hey Clay, what would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward if the price can hold up above one 1475, that would make things look extremely powerful, but certainly by no means am I saying that if one 1475 can hold, then you know the entire chart.
NEUT28|Ruin not saying that at all, just saying that from a very short term perspective.
BULL29|And if the price can stay up above of one 1475, you know that really implies that the Bulls seem to have quite a bit of momentum on their side.
NEUT30|Now what about areas of resistance?
NEUT31|And this is kind of the level here, were very curious that the prices at a pretty interesting spot on the chart.
NEUT32|Now before I talk about this level, just a quick lesson here in charting, there's a rule out there that states when levels of support are broken, they tend to act as resistance.
NEUT33|So now put that line in place and you'll hopefully see exactly what I mean.
NEUT34|But it's this level right here at 116, which shockingly enough right there.
NEUT35|The power of charges where the price is struggling right now.
NEUT36|Why is 116 so interesting?
NEUT37|Well, again, levels of support you can see acted as support acted as support.
NEUT38|Both those instances, the price balance when the price fell blow, it tend to act as resistance acted as resistance.
NEUT39|ACTED as resistance and then today most recently acting as resistance, so by no means am I saying 116 can't be broken.
NEUT40|I'm just saying that it makes sense why the price is struggling right up around that area and why.
NEUT41|I'm very curious.
NEUT42|Can the price finally break up above it 'cause it hasn't been up above it since.
NEUT43|You know going way back till October.
NEUT44|So very.
NEUT45|You know from a technical perspective an interesting spot right here.
NEUT46|Next, key level of resistance.
NEUT47|After that up there at right around 1 eighteen 25118 but one step at a time.
NEUT48|You know one bridge to cross at a time.
BULL49|Let's see if the price can cross up above 116.
BULL50|So very interesting past couple of weeks for the chart.
NEUT51|We'll have to see if the Bulls can keep on running.
NEUT52|One of the most popular questions I get is likely, how do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT53|So what I've done is put together this free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT54|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader and Brian means click right there to get access to the guide, the guide itself is very short and to the point.
NEUT55|And like I say it is free.
BULL56|Thanks for watching.
NEUT57|"Have a good one."""
