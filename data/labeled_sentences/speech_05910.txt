NEUT0|"""Here coming to you live from Dallas trading floor."
NEUT1|I'm going to share with you the secrets of trading Apple stock in the month of December and this is how I'm going to be trading Apple stock for hopefully for a maximum benefit.
BEAR2|Apple, as you know, is a very large stock and everybody has likes holding it, but it as of late has been in a downward trend.
NEUT3|As you can see, since November 27th, the direction of Apple has changed.
BEAR4|It has changed direction and it's been a downward trend.
BULL5|But just recently Apple has made a move upwards and it's moved up across this line.
BULL6|So when this happened, I bought 100 shares of Apple and this stock probably will continue to move upward for at least for, at least for a time until it reaches this peak here.
NEUT7|So here's the strategy I'm going to be holding Apple on up until it gets too right below 140.
NEUT8|If it pushes above that, I'll keep it.
NEUT9|If it stays below that, I'll sell it, and here's how I know when to sell it.
BEAR10|As the stock moves higher than it should based on this trend, I will push my stop loss up every day and it will be 2 1/2% below the closing price.
NEUT11|Eventually the stock will fail in a pullback, but when it does I'll make a profit.
BULL12|So I hope you like this.

NEUT14|"See you then."""
