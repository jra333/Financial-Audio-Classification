BULL0|"""But he's continues to grow."
NEUT1|What would it mean for Facebook's bottom line?
NEUT2|Let's ask Brent Thill.
NEUT3|He's managing director and senior analyst at Jefferies brand.
BULL4|It's it's good to have you.
NEUT5|Does Unilever and Verizon's boycott change things for you?
NEUT6|Kelly, it does not.
NEUT7|It obviously is clearly not great news, but we think more advertisers are joined Facebook than leaving their 8,000,000 advertisers on the Facebook platform with Facebook has done recently with shops is let small businesses get online easier and today you know there are 800,000,000 global small businesses, 160 million of those use Facebook and only 5 or 6,000,000 pay.
BULL8|So there's a tremendous opportunity still for advertisers joining.
BEAR9|The ROI is off the charts relative to other advertising means and nothing against Unilever.
NEUT10|But I'm not really influenced to buy a dove bar soap by looking at an ad from Unilever Undubbed, so I need so everyone needs so.
NEUT11|So yeah, when Patagonian art eriks pull out, these are amazing brands that do a lot of great things for the world.
NEUT12|And I think that clearly if you see the Stampede of more of these then will be concerned but.
BEAR13|Again, more joining then leaving what happened with Cambridge Analytica Brent, which this reminds me a lot of we had a lot of advertisers leave or threatened to boycott the platform.
BEAR14|Back then Facebook shares very choppy for awhile.
NEUT15|Did they all eventually return to the platform?
NEUT16|And do you think this time some might possibly leave for good?
NEUT17|So Facebook was $130 stock during that time, and I think ultimately what we continue to say is that there's more good on the platform than bad, and it's a neutral platform.
NEUT18|It's an open platform and that's what Zuckerberg intends it to be.
NEUT19|So we think obviously everyone is going to have their view, but I think this goes back to you.
NEUT20|Get a couple big vendors that pull off and not great to see, but you gotta put it in context of a world where I.
BULL21|And there's really only a few great digital platforms that continue to benefit, so I think we've continued to see these headlines rests in these headwinds, but ultimately we think, again, you have to look at the bigger picture and the bigger picture is the ROI is incredible.
BULL22|More people are going there and we think that this will.
NEUT23|This will pass through.
NEUT24|And Julie, I think in Unilever's case they said they're leaving the platform through the end of the year.
NEUT25|Through the end of the year, they said they might change their mind, but the real question Kelly, I think it's because Unilever is such a big advertise.
NEUT26|Or whether other companies such as Procter and Gamble feel like they want to join in.
NEUT27|You know, we were really being the biggest one there.
NEUT28|Verizon also meaningful now Facebook.
BULL29|I just want to let you know, Kelly, that we just moments ago got word from Facebook responding to this move by Unilever saying that they invest billions of dollars each year to keep the Community safe and continuously work with outside experts to review and update our policies.
NEUT30|Noting that they open themselves up to a civil rights.
NEUT31|Audit and have band 250 white supremacist organizations from Facebook and Instagram.
NEUT32|They go on and talk about how much they hate speech that they do take down.
NEUT33|But what I think is really interesting.
NEUT34|Kelly is what I've been hearing from my sources in the advertising world is what they want is they want Facebook to take down content that's racist.
NEUT35|Even if there's no imminent harm from it.
NEUT36|Or, you know, hate speech or threats of harm, even if it doesn't seem like the harm is imminent.
NEUT37|So what these brands?
NEUT38|It seems like what they really want is Facebook to go one step further in terms of what they think is.
BEAR39|"Inappropriate on the platform, which will require really a decision by Mark Zuckerberg to change where he's drawing the line."""
