NEUT11|The page shows two panels.
NEUT12|The top panel presents the MPI graph showing how the index changes overtime in this case.
NEUT13|Over the past three months.
NEUT14|The bottom panel presents the time course of the broad S&P 500 market index over the same time period.
NEUT15|Three months in this case, for convenient comparison of U MPI predictions with actual behavior of the stock market.

NEUT20|So how can you use this graph for predicting stock market trends?
BULL21|If you MPI shows a consistent trend upwards breaking through the threshold level corresponding to approximately 3% above the previous you MPI minimum, this provides an indicator that the market is likely to rise.
BEAR22|Likewise, if you MPI shows a consistent trend downwards, breaking through the threshold level corresponding to approximately 3% below the previously MPI maximum, this provides an indicator that the market is likely to fall.
NEUT23|The 3% threshold level is marked in the graph by a short horizontal line.
NEUT24|In most cases you MPI breaks through the 3% threshold a few weeks in advance of the actual rise or fall in the stock market.
BULL25|That's providing a reliable prediction for market moves.
NEUT26|Reaching the approximate 3% threshold should not be mechanically viewed as a sell or buy signal for stocks.
NEUT27|It rather should be considered an alert that the market is likely to change direction after breaking through the threshold, U MPI should be closely monitored to confirm that the emerging trend is stable.
NEUT28|You can choose the desired time spent to review by clicking these time period buttons.
NEUT29|You can switch between three months view six months view and 12 month view.
