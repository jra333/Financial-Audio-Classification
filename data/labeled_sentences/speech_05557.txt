NEUT0|"""Let's check in on the PG and E Saga."
BULL1|The California utility filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection shares of PG and E up 17% when we walked in the studio is I.
NEUT2|Am I supposed to put this on my watch list now?
NEUT3|I mean, we've talked before about how look this is utility.
NEUT4|It can't just go away, right?
NEUT5|But right, you do, but I just assumed it was going to reappear in some form that maybe was completely removed from the public markets.
NEUT6|Yeah, am I am.
NEUT7|I now supposed to think.
NEUT8|Oh well, maybe there's not just a future for this utility, but a future for investing in this utility?
NEUT9|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT10|So.
NEUT11|Utilities are so weird, like if you.
NEUT12|If you produce a product in it, for example, catches on fire and you get sued for it and you don't have money to cover it, you go out of business and that fire producing product doesn't get produced anymore.
NEUT13|You can't do that with utilities.
NEUT14|You can't say, well, you know electricity caused the electricity or the production of electricity caused these fires.
NEUT15|In Northern California, companies going out of business let's just produce no more electricity.
NEUT16|In Northern California, there's your solution.
NEUT17|What's going to happen?
NEUT18|So there were fires in 2017 and there was and the California legislature, the California Public Utilities Commission, excuse me, passed a ruling that allows the utilities to pass on the costs of the liabilities for such events onto rate holders so.
NEUT19|You know good thing that they did too, because you know otherwise.
BEAR20|We would have an enormous financial issue with P Jeannie.
BEAR21|So yes, it's going bankrupt.
NEUT22|It has sufficient assets to cover its cash liabilities.
NEUT23|It's going to come out of bankruptcy, restructured the equity will in all likelihood have some value.
NEUT24|The bonds were trading at $0.85 on the dollar earlier.
NEUT25|I think that they will rally what you have now in this place is a plan.
NEUT26|Are you interested?
NEUT27|No, no, because I mean.
NEUT28|Here's the thing.
BEAR29|It is going to become much more expensive to produce electricity in this country for a couple of reasons.
NEUT30|One, because this latest changing and we can argue over whether you know we can argue over global warming a little bit.
NEUT31|But utilities are having to respond, right?
NEUT32|They're having to change their slate.
BULL33|The cheapest forms of energy, coal, Nat, gas oil are being ramped down.
NEUT34|Other forms are being ramped up, but also these types of liabilities are popping up.
NEUT35|A lot more as well and you could say that it's because of climate change.
NEUT36|You could also say because it's a change in how people live.
NEUT37|The town called Paradise, which is where the fires were and where the most damage was where the houses were destroyed was probably not something that really would have existed in the same form even 40 years ago.
NEUT38|It was largely a retirement community.
NEUT39|People you know, as the change of lifestyle went up and lived in the Woods, right?
NEUT40|And?
NEUT41|So no, I don't.
NEUT42|"I don't find utilities to be a very exciting investment because they will be boring until they're exciting in the exact wrong way."""
