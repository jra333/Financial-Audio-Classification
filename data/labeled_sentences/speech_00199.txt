NEUT0|"""Well, let's take a look at the Eiffel stop here."
NEUT1|It formed a small red candle.
BEAR2|Here it means it's a down day for the Apple stock and we can see the warning here is very small.
NEUT3|Compared to the volume before it, it means the selling pressure is not so much.
NEUT4|But the very thing that if we check the ARM ICD, we can see here that my CD nearly zero.
NEUT5|It means the momentum has a different.
NEUT6|Says compared to when it's on the.
NEUT7|Upset so we can see from the.
NEUT8|From the beginning of this year.
BULL9|Till nearly October we consider the momentum is very strong is the highest point is is.
NEUT10|It's about five 5.0, but now it's nearly zero, so it means there's no momentum at all and we can see the consolidation from.
NEUT11|The.
NEUT12|11th of November till now has lost nearly two months and there's no change.
NEUT13|The stock trading between this range with a very narrow trading range.
BEAR14|It means the former leader has lost its momentum and if we change the chart into.
NEUT15|Weekly chart you can see here actually.
NEUT16|After the huge jump from here is on the 30th of March, it's a huge jump.
NEUT17|To the.
NEUT18|Search here 1st of August.
NEUT19|We can see these long job then a pullback and now a consolidation.
NEUT20|It nearly formed a double bottom in mid term, but we can see here.
BEAR21|The uptrend has very, very weak and the volume is very small, so we can see here it's very unlikely for it to breakthrough here.
BEAR22|The possibility that it will pull back to retest the supporting level here is about $1.00 point on here at 103, so it's very likely to retest it.
NEUT23|So don't chase stock here.
BULL24|"Thank you."""
