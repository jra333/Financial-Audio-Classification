NEUT0|"""Hey, how's it going?"
NEUT1|Everybody welcome back to the channel and look at here.
NEUT2|Look at your new stock finally.
BULL3|Starts exploding Neo up 9.75 percent .39% after hours.
BULL4|I'm up about 700 bucks.
NEUT5|Today I have 157 shares.
NEUT6|Guess what I actually did do what I was going to do and.
NEUT7|Do one of these orders.
NEUT8|I sold a put option at 51 and it gave me a premium about 270 bucks and you know what I'd do without 270?
NEUT9|I instantly bought in at Neo at 5360.
NEUT10|So I just bought it and like I said, I'm not really worried about the price.
NEUT11|Right now I'm just worried about how many shares my goal to hit 200 shares as soon as possible and the way I'm going to be doing it is by selling calls and selling.
NEUT12|Puts on your stock.
NEUT13|Yeah, and this is just the beginning of the week.
BULL14|I believe this will keep going up in the in the short term until Neil De and unless there's any surprises on your day, I believe next week there will be a sell off.
NEUT15|Depending on how high you'll runs this week.
BULL16|But if it's any indication, I believe that it will break all time highs of $57.
NEUT17|I believe that was the highs.
BULL18|Yeah, about $57 was the high and I believe we can probably break it that this week and maybe makes will be a little bit of a sell off, but I don't think it would go under 50 bucks if there is a sell off next week and it's just great news overall in the EV markets as you all know, Tesla stock at all time high today.
NEUT19|I believe at the all time high of about seven 4744.
BULL20|Yeah, 7:44 AM and at that point Tesla was breaking the market cap of 700 billion.
NEUT21|And that's a insane market cap if I'm being honest an it's all good because Tesla did.
NEUT22|Hit their goal of selling or delivering 500,000 cars this year and then selling 500,000 cars.
NEUT23|Put them at about $700 billion market cap, even if it's or value or not.
NEUT24|Does is still going exponential rate, but then they are expected to sell about or deliver about 800,000 cars in 2021, so we'll see how that goes an.
NEUT25|Just by looking at it, Tesla selling 500,000 cars this year, right?
NEUT26|Neil is expected to deliver or sell about 100 forty 200,000 cars, so it's a little bit less than 1/3.
NEUT27|So if we do just by simple math reduce 1/3 of about 700 billion, it's going to be about.
NEUT28|More than 222 hundred $30 billion.
NEUT29|If Neil sells 150,000 cars next year.
NEUT30|So if everything goes correctly, we could.
BULL31|We could potentially see Neo hitting about 200 and 200 plus billion dollar market cap, so could be a 3X but that would be a better price.
NEUT32|Talking about $150 by the end of the year if Neil hits that 150,000 cars delivered by twenty 2021.
NEUT33|But if I'm being more conservative, I can see Neil start killing maybe 80 to anywhere from $80.00 to $150 low and $80.00 up by the end of the year for nails dug to as high as $150 and that's my.
NEUT34|Honest projections.
NEUT35|If Neo headstone 150,000 car goal and I'm putting it at the level of what Tesla is because I believe Neo and Tesla are the top.
NEUT36|Top dogs in the EV space right now because they're the ones that are selling the most electric vehicles and Neil is expected to triple up this year and deliveries like that's a big.
BULL37|"That's a big jump."""
