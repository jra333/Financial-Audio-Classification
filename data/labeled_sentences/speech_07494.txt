NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol V LDR."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So what eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up here above $19.50 and don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 1950.
BULL8|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT9|Taking a step back and look at everything from the bigger picture POV.
NEUT10|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT11|The 50.
NEUT12|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT13|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move.
NEUT14|That right there would be defined as.
NEUT15|The move just wants a purple line.
NEUT16|As long as the price stays above that line.
BULL17|As line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|His visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yes and above 1950 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT21|Initial battleground going to be right there at $21.60.
NEUT22|And then if the price can push up through 2160 next key level after that going to be right up there around $22.30.
NEUT23|So keep an eye on those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT24|But All in all, any angle you look at things very impressed the volume.
BULL25|Very impressive price movement.
NEUT26|Not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward?
NEUT27|Let's see what happens.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT30|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR34|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
