NEUT0|"""So I'm going to be talking about if Bitcoin cash is worth it and giving my price prediction for this coin for 2021."
NEUT1|Now going to be pulling this coin up on a couple of different exchanges actually recently purchased it as well.
NEUT2|I put $46,000 into this coin.
NEUT3|Now this is going to be financial advice, but I'm going to give you my thoughts on Bitcoin Cash in where it can go this year, so currently it's it.
NEUT4|You know, roughly $600, you know if we pull up the chart on it you can basically see that.
NEUT5|It's been a little bit up and down for, you know, the last week, the month it's up and then the one year it's up about 58% Now the thing you gotta understand about Bitcoin cash is that it's a top ten crypto.
NEUT6|Its all time high, was around $4300 and that's all the way back when Bitcoin was only at 20,000.
NEUT7|You can see here in Coinmarketcap.
NEUT8|Bitcoin Cash is sitting at #10 and if you look into any of the top coins that are in the top ten other than Tether you can see that all of these coins are up like.
NEUT9|Two to five to 600% OK, except Bitcoin Cash.
BEAR10|Now this coin is extremely undervalued.
NEUT11|That is just my opinion on it.
NEUT12|I am going to show you that I did buy what I said I bought of it, so I'm not just saying I bought it.
NEUT13|I did buy some of it on Robin Hood, mainly because you know I had some money on here so I decided, you know, put 36 K in and then I put $10,000 on Coinbase Pro and I've just got the normal coin based pulled up but you can see I'm actually still up.
NEUT14|My average Bitcoin cash right now is around like 55150 bucks, so I'm kind of comfortable with that.
NEUT15|But you know, if we were talking about fair value for Bitcoin cash, it should be at 1800 per coin based on basically where Bitcoin is bitcoin's at $52,000 right now.
BEAR16|OK, when I say fair value, that's still well below where it could be, you know, based on when Bitcoin was at 20,000.
NEUT17|Like I said, Bitcoin Cash was around 4000.
NEUT18|That would mean we need to be between 8:00 and 10,000 for Bitcoin Cash, and it doesn't like take a genius to really look at this and figure this out.
NEUT19|I mean, for whatever reason, Bitcoin cash is just lagging and you know I would say my price prediction for the coin you know for 2021 I would say at the low end you know we could see $2500 and then obviously the higher end we could see a Bitcoin cash of $10,000.
NEUT20|So you know, I just think that there's so much upside to this coin.
NEUT21|Not a lot of people are talking about it, but when you look at everything else out there and you're trying to get the best purchase possible, there aren't many coins that haven't really had a big run up.
NEUT22|I'd say Bitcoin Cash in XRP are like two of the top 10 coins that haven't really done a big move yet.
NEUT23|So anyways, that's just my opinion guys.
