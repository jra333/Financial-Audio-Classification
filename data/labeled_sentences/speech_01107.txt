BEAR0|"""10X adoption that we've seen so many numbers thrown around."
NEUT1|We had the CIO Guggenheim Scott Minerd on Fed Day telling us that he'll see he thinks fundamentally, Bitcoin should be about 400,000.
NEUT2|I guess the next day said it should be in a million.
NEUT3|I mean, the numbers keep on going.
NEUT4|But who's driving this at the moment is institutional buyers that are driving the crescendo in prices.
NEUT5|Is it retail?
NEUT6|Will you sing?
BULL7|There's definitely a huge uptick in institutional adoption.
NEUT8|I mean, we're seeing this across the headlines and in comparison, you're not seeing the same uptick across retail.
BEAR9|I mean, if you look across any major social indicators, you know retail awareness of this rally in 2020 is still relatively muted now.
NEUT10|I think the tides will turn, and we're going to have both sides of the market kind of participate here.
NEUT11|But really, I mean, we have to think about some of the developments here with PayPal rolling out, buying sell capabilities to some 380,000,000 users around the world.
NEUT12|With Giants like Facebook leaning in.
NEUT13|Every major financial institution now embracing crypto.
NEUT14|I mean it's hard to see how we don't go from 100,000,000 users currently to a billion over the next few years.
NEUT15|That's a call right there, but you talk about all these institutions, other large companies getting into this space has regulation caught up with that.
NEUT16|Yeah, so I mean listen.
NEUT17|Regulation is always evolving.
NEUT18|I mean how many times over the past several years have we seen the headline of such and such government bans Bitcoin only to reverse it a year later?
BULL19|So listen, regulate regulators are definitely getting more comfortable with the space.
NEUT20|"I think they recognize that this is an innovation that is not going to be uninvented and the Bitcoin is here to stay and that really the story is probably going to be much broader than just Bitcoin here."""
