NEUT1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, what to expect from Neo on Monday, January 4th, including the prediction.
NEUT2|Let's get started.
BULL3|The Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, NIO is now again producing massive gains for its investors after the recent drop.
NEUT4|Many investors are excited about the future and Neo Day, but we need to talk about what will happen to Neo stock price on Monday and this week.
BULL5|Nile raised in the past week and Thursday due to price upgrade by Bank of America from $54.00 to $57 and the excitement for Neo Day.
NEUT6|On the annual Neo Day, investors gather and learn news about the company, plans for the future and Nail reveals some brand new information.
NEUT7|As in the past.
BULL8|According to ABC Bank analyst Thomas Blanchard passed Nile Days were good catalyst for the Neo stock price as the price surged in 2018 and 2019 due to very good news from Neo were revealed.
BULL9|We expect the same this year, but we have even more good news, including New E 7 battery swap technology.
NEUT10|A-150 kilowatts per hour battery and a prototype of their new sedan.
BULL11|This is expected to be a big catalyst for this stock price, and judging by this information we expect Nyota skyrocket to levels we haven't seen before.
NEUT12|Using this algorithmic system, we predict that Neo will reach levels of $63 to $74.00 after Neo Day.
BULL13|I think Neo has good growth ahead, he said.
NEUT14|This is therefore the reason that Neo stock price is currently up.
BULL15|Neo stock prices up due to expectations of very good news being released on the annual Neo Day.
NEUT16|However, there is something that investors need to know.
BULL17|Bank of America analyst Betty Mae said the following we expect good results by Neo stock on Neo Day.
NEUT18|However, investors should keep in mind that some of the things that will be revealed on Neo Day are already included in the share price, such as the 150 kW per hour battery.
NEUT19|With that said, most other news have not been spoiled yet and have not been included in their share price.
NEUT20|This means some stuff is already included in the share price.
BULL21|However, we investors still have a good opportunity and multiple investors are setting price targets as high as anywhere from only $55 to $80.00 per share.
BULL22|In summary, Neo is a very good long term company that is expected to skyrocket on its annual Neo Day by as much as 50% and bring investors massive profits selling Neo stock right now before Neo Day would be risky choice, as Neo is expected to fly on Neo Day.
NEUT23|The proof for this is last year's 2019 no day where the stock price went from $12.00 to $17.00 and we expect the same this year.
BULL24|Hold long and strong blue skies are coming.
BULL25|Thanks for watching.
