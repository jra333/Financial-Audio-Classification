NEUT0|"""Alright, two more minutes before we get started with trading, let's squeeze in a mad dash marvelle."
NEUT1|Yes, David multilayer complex substrates IC, packaging capacity, fab constraints, certain technology nodes.
BEAR2|Yes, David Marvel is down because of the chip shortage that we keep talking about these basic parts of chips that they don't have.
NEUT3|Remember, they do some autos, otherwise would have been exceptional number, but So what I mean otherwise, maybe* it?
NEUT4|What do you do?
NEUT5|We sold some stock for my Chapel trust 'cause I just think that when people hear shortage.
NEUT6|And then here semiconductor they sell.
NEUT7|They don't think about demand and it didn't help that when you speak to Mr. Murphy today and I think Matt is fantastic.
NEUT8|He's now talking about that.
BEAR9|You're going to be with this chip shortage for a long time and that is devastating for people when they try to figure out when this whole storage is going to end.
BEAR10|I just it's very hard to believe that you have a 5G company that has been the best an it's just being felled by the fact that the companies that that make this stuff didn't predict that things were going to be great.
NEUT11|Marvel now is going to buy a lot more inventory.
NEUT12|They're getting away from just in time and they're going to just in case.
BEAR13|But the damage might have been done.
NEUT14|People going to sell it.
NEUT15|I think it's a terrific company, but you have to let it come in.
BULL16|Because yes, the chip shortages alive and unfortunately all too well.
NEUT17|David, it's true, Jim even yesterday still Lantis was asked whether or not this shortage would end at the end of the second half and said he wasn't sure.
NEUT18|So it's sounding a little bit less like a first half story.
NEUT19|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT20|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
