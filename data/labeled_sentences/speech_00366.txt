NEUT0|"""AEN and you can see here."
NEUT1|This broke out in December over a dollar per share.
BEAR2|It got pretty crazy here.
BEAR3|You know fairly volatile on ATN.
NEUT4|Actually try to buy it into the first time it broke out over one.
BEAR5|It failed and I sold to a very very small loss because the stock wasn't working out and then it rips all the way back down to $0.60 so it did rebound off that level.
BEAR6|But you know I could have been in a huge loss at that point and I would have you know, as I was talking about in the other video.
NEUT7|That you have to be able to just, you know, say this stuff isn't working out, just move on.
BEAR8|You know if it comes back you can always rebuy that stock but never hold on to a stock and put yourself in a position where I would have been down thousands and thousands of dollars here just because you know I was too stubborn as well, even though it did rebound, you know I would have been in that position of oh crap, here we go.
BEAR9|I'm down at $0.60 or $0.80 wherever this is right here.
BEAR10|And you know, I could have potentially said screw it.
NEUT11|I'm selling down here and took that loss.
NEUT12|So don't even let yourself get into that position where it drops like that.
NEUT13|If it doesn't work out, get out of the position.
NEUT14|Take the smallest loss possible and you can always re buy the stock, and that's exactly what I did an SYNI, didn't you know?
BEAR15|Allow that opportunity for me to be down very significantly, but I did get back in here at 104 so you know I was just over dollar per share.
NEUT16|And I wrote this thing out.
BULL17|It did consolidate.
BULL18|It broke out a very strong day, came back down, consolidated form the flag before getting two huge days of an ice ribbon.
BULL19|I exited at 134, ended up making $10,875.00, so a huge gain here.
NEUT20|From there.
NEUT21|It continued to write the 13 MA.
NEUT22|If you remember from the previous video, the 13 Ma is like the background of short term trends.
BEAR23|It's obviously not going to be perfect.
BEAR24|You can see here it retested it several times and drop down below this red line several times.
NEUT25|But not by a lot.
NEUT26|You know, this kind of followed this guide line all the way up here.
BULL27|This thing went all the way up towards $3 per share.
NEUT28|280 was the high, but I did trade it for around 2 again as this broke out once more.
NEUT29|I got in at 148, took a very quick profit at 166, another 2700 bucks and I sold very early.
NEUT30|I saw that 166 and this thing ripped all the way up to 280 and this was a gold pattern.
NEUT31|As you can see, this had been trading under a dollar per share for quite some time from June.
NEUT32|For about six months or so and then finally got this huge spike in volume.
NEUT33|So there is some kind of news that came out here and we just had this new kind of found trend forming up.
NEUT34|You know, that's what you look for in stocks.
BULL35|"Are recent spikes in volume, so that's kind of a, you know, a sign of a significant new trend forming on stocks."""
