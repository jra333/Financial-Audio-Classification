NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this weird video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Will a rough way to end the week here for Amazon as it's not like it crashed, but it's now breaking down through a very important technical level here and I'll get to that in a second.
NEUT5|First thing to do here is just kind of map out that the overall flow of things has certainly been down, so I'll just use this red line here.
BULL6|It served its purpose at its previous spot, but you can just see that overtime here that Red line is actually doing a fantastic job of showing the areas of resistance and the overall selling pressure that currently exists.
NEUT7|I mean, you just look through the history of things every single time it's balanced, including right there, you know it's gone back down.
NEUT8|So Roy, to make this very cut and dry, moving forward as far as the technical point of view and resistance levels are concerned, the main battleground to watch closely is going to be that red line right there.
NEUT9|That will be the main area where there is going to be any sort of talk of a turn around.
NEUT10|First thing that needs to happen is the price needs to be able to get above that level and stay above it.
NEUT11|So keep a very close eye on that red line here moving forward.
NEUT12|But the more interesting dynamic and I think the level and overall price movement that has captured people's attention is in regards to that pink line right there.
NEUT13|Which on my chart denotes the very well known 200.
NEUT14|Moving average.
BEAR15|And you can see the price is now broken down below there.
NEUT16|Now that doesn't mean it's the end of the world or anything like that, but it is certainly something that needs to be aware of an that could very well be the beginning of a much bigger move to the downside.
NEUT17|Again, it maybe this is just a little faulty breakdown at all.
NEUT18|You know, quickly snap back upwards, so that's always a possibility too.
NEUT19|But I mean it has now broken down.
BEAR20|It's been, you know, staying down below that area.
NEUT21|So now that brings about the question of, you know if this does continue on down, were some of these next potential areas of support, and the next main overall area of support is not going down there around 3155.
NEUT22|So in my opinion.
NEUT23|Well, nothing is guaranteed.
NEUT24|I don't think anybody would be shocked to see the price now potentially drift down there and test that 3155 Mark.
NEUT25|So keep a close eye on that, but at the price, does you know turn itself around and works its way back upwards?
NEUT26|Then you still gotta deal with that resistance red line there.
NEUT27|But yeah, we'll see how this one plays out next week.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT30|But it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL32|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT37|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
