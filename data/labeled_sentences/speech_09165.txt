BULL0|"""We are going to dig in."
NEUT1|We've got Mike Novogratz Galaxy Investment Partners CEO with us.
NEUT2|Mike.
BULL3|Thanks so much for joining us.
BEAR4|So you know why is Bitcoin falling today?
NEUT5|If concern about inflation is rising, is it not the hedge against inflation that some had hoped it would be?
NEUT6|Well, let, let let's put things in perspective, right?
BULL7|Bitcoin is up almost 60% on the year with the SNP flat.
NEUT8|There is some correlation to asset prices, right?
NEUT9|Chairman Pal is easy with money.
BEAR10|In asset prices, go up if Chairman Paul Flinches and people start saying, maybe he won't be as easy.
NEUT11|That was the body language of his today, right?
NEUT12|We're not going to be easier.
NEUT13|And that means maybe we take things back.
BEAR14|Earlier all asset prices are going to go down a little bit.
NEUT15|The bigger story, though, the far far bigger story, is that in the last two months, Bitcoin and crypto and blockchain have become an institutional asset class.
NEUT16|There is no debate anymore, and so from JP Morgan to tell their clients they should put 1 to 2% of their.
BULL17|Net worth in Bitcoin is a staggering shift.
NEUT18|Morgan Stanley getting involved.
NEUT19|Goldman Sachs getting involved.
NEUT20|All the tech companies getting involved and I can tell you from what we're seeing, the pipeline is deep and so we've had this secular shift where all of a sudden this is a thing.
NEUT21|Now it's an asset class and everybody is short right?
NEUT22|A few insurance companies have it in most dump, and so every once in awhile you have things called paradigm shifts in markets.
NEUT23|We're in the middle of a paradigm shift and so.
BULL24|Bitcoin is wildly outperforming gold, even though they're both hedging the same thing.
BULL25|It's outperforming because we're in this once in a generational adoption of crypto.
NEUT26|Banks are frantically trying to figure out how to get into crypto, not just because of Bitcoin, right?
NEUT27|The commercial banks, the JP?
NEUT28|Morgan's of the world make a fortune in cross border payments, right?
BULL29|JP Morgan made $11 billion last year in cross border payments, and now they see stable coins coming.
NEUT30|And they're like, oh, so you're going to see a monster.
NEUT31|Investment in this space.
NEUT32|We're seeing it in M&A.
BEAR33|Lots of the infrastructure companies are being snapped up by tech companies.
NEUT34|You're going to see it in Ma.
NEUT35|You're going to see the new participants in in in Bitcoin funds.
NEUT36|"In another crypto funds."""
