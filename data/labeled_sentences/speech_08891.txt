BULL0|"""Hey son, investors and welcome back to another video."
BEAR1|So today we're going to talk about AMC Enertainment yes and see that today this stock has dropped to as low as $6.
NEUT2|What happened is it still time to buy, you know, is there going to be a short squeeze like what is going on guys?
NEUT3|So we're going to talk about all that and if you're new here, definitely subscribe.
NEUT4|Yes, enjoy the short video straight to the point.
NEUT5|No BS, No 10 minute videos.
NEUT6|Not only that guys, but if you.
BULL7|I've been signed up with Weibo.
NEUT8|Link will be down.
NEUT9|Scribble, sign up here for free stocks for a limited time only and then it's only two free stocks so guys I get $34 songs that again you know free Apple stocks.
BULL10|Microsoft definitely a good thing that I recommend.
NEUT11|Not only that, once again the links down below and I'm going to be giving away $50 to a random person 'cause I get free socks every single day.
NEUT12|But you know last week if you guys don't know yes and see how you know AMC spiked up to as high as I believe is like around $22.00 or something like that.
NEUT13|And then you can see that how it just dropped like $7.00 and then they boosted up back up to like $16.00, But then it dropped back down to a dollar.
NEUT14|So I truly believe guys that you know AMC Entertainments.
BULL15|It's definitely going to, you know, bounce back up.
NEUT16|But remember guys you know Robin Hood restricted us from actually being able to buy shares.
BULL17|I was able to buy shares on weible, you know and hop in and make money.
NEUT18|So if you do not want to miss out definitely recommend soap and we will.
NEUT19|Not only that, but we will.
NEUT20|They haven't ever had you know huge issues like Robin Hood when, like all of a sudden you can sell or you can buy socks.
NEUT21|So I definitely got encourage you guys to buy.
NEUT22|We won't know that.
NEUT23|Not only that but M1 finance.
NEUT24|You can also deposit $100 and they give you $30 only for you $30 that you can use on any song that you want.
NEUT25|So the link is also down below so you can see the AMC at the moment.
BEAR26|It's $8.00 and it just continues to drop.
BEAR27|Almost down 40% this morning and I truly believe that obviously this this company was supposed to call or call out that they were going bankrupt in the beating of this year, and unfortunately they well, Fortunately well now.
NEUT28|Well first of all you know it is what it is.
BEAR29|You know they're going bankrupt, but you know all of a sudden their socks starts to go up like this.
NEUT30|It's absolutely crazy, but I know one thing for a fact, and I've seen this before.
NEUT31|If you guys didn't know about hurts.
NEUT32|And you know they were doing really good and then you know the pandemic hit and then they went bankrupt.
NEUT33|And then when they were a penny stock it was like around $0.80.
BULL34|It would boost up to like 2 set.
NEUT35|I mean two dollars $3 'cause people would buy it had a lot of volume and it was like that for awhile until NASDAQ unfortunately delisted them.
NEUT36|That is right.
NEUT37|So AMC Entertainment I can.
BULL38|These are my predictions, I can see it still boosting back up, especially if it drops this low.
NEUT39|A lot of people are going to buy.
BULL40|Which is going to cost once again to go back up, maybe not as high as $20.00, but maybe up to like $10.
BULL41|It can draw drops like $4 three dollars, and then it's going to boost up to like 7-8 dollars.
NEUT42|I can definitely see that, but let me know down in the comments section below.
NEUT43|What do you guys think about AMC Entertainment?
NEUT44|Do you guys think it's still a buy, especially buying the dips right now?
BULL45|Or it's going to continue to crash just like it's been crashing for like the past week and pass these, but I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT46|If you do give it a big thumbs up.
NEUT47|"Let me know down the conversation below your thoughts on this and I will see you guys on my next video."""
