NEUT0|"""Hey guys it's a man I'm coming at you with some breaking news in regard to the CC Ivy and Lucid Motors merger."
NEUT1|Just getting right into it as shout out to at Spike Bobby who tweeted this out on Twitter.
NEUT2|He put a Civ.
NEUT3|Venrock Associates proposed to sell lucid Motors.
NEUT4|Incorporation to see Civ updated today.
NEUT5|Thanks for this ad to El Professor Shadow too as well.
NEUT6|So basically this is a look at the Bloomberg Terminal platform and as you can see it says.
NEUT7|A consortium led by Venrock Associates proposed to sell lucid Motors to Churchill Capital Court for the transaction was proposed on January 11th, 2021, and it says financial terms of the transaction are still unknown.
NEUT8|As for the dates, we can see the proposal date is January 11th, 2021.
NEUT9|It does not say the expected completion date, however, for status, it says proposed on the block and for duration.
NEUT10|It says 31 dates, and it's interesting because 31 days after that initial January.
NEUT11|11th date would actually be today, February 11, so I think it's interesting that we're getting that news today, which could possibly indicate that we will be getting some merger news very, very soon and well in terms of the preliminary deal terms.
NEUT12|It also says payment type cash.
NEUT13|As for next shot is back Bobby again.
NEUT14|He posted another update where he put an M and a consortium.
NEUT15|Details on the Bloomberg Terminal platform.
NEUT16|Again, Bloomberg is very important in this because a lot of information that we've been getting in regard to the entire merger has been on the Bloomberg platform.
NEUT17|So first of all, the entire article that was initially released that Lucid would be merging with Michael clients.
NEUT18|Back was released on Bloomberg, and there's been a lot of other different information and evidence that circulated around the Bloomberg Terminal platform.
NEUT19|As you can see, this is a look at the merger and acquisition consortium details and then shout out to Alex Cutler some more Bloomberg Terminal evidence.
NEUT20|It says there was a Bloomberg Terminal image.
BEAR21|Posted by Wall Street, right that a lot of people got scared off from that.
NEUT22|The Civ Lucid deal was not listed.
NEUT23|However, it quickly got put back on.
NEUT24|And then after that is when we got this information from SPAC, Bobby, and So what Alex Cutler had to say was that there was either a glitch or there was an update occurring.
NEUT25|And clearly there was an update that a curd and we got the news that Venrock associates proposed to sell lucid Motors and Alex Cutler again shout out to the man you know, always keeps us updated in regard to the CRV and Lucid Motors merger he put can confirm that the Bloomberg Terminal was changed, the payment type.
NEUT26|So as you can see this line here.
NEUT27|It was basically changed from stock.
NEUT28|To cash, so this is a prior image where the payment type was listed as stock and this is the most recent image that we got just right now where the payment type is listed as cash.
NEUT29|So clearly an update was made which means that we could be hearing very very soon in regard to the merger and it's looking like that it might happen and you know, just for those who may not know the deal.
NEUT30|Payment terms can be in cash stock or some combination of cash and or stock, so it's great to see that you know we saw this change on the terminal platform and then we get that news literally about Venrock associates.
NEUT31|A little while later.
BULL32|As for Civ, you know did not have a great day today for down close to 4.11% after hours, making some big moves where we can see it is up 13% or $4.06 per share and is now trading for around $35.40 per share so you know it's definitely looking like that.
