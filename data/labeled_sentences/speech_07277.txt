NEUT0|"""Welcome to locate gems where we talk about the best undervalued coins in the cryptocurrency markets and in the OTC markets today."
NEUT1|This is one that we've been talking about on this channel.
BULL2|It's finally broken above that billion dollar market cap now insisted around 1.226, so about $1.2 billion and it has about $131 million in volume, so ultimately about 10% volume to market cap.
BULL3|We want to see that get higher.
BULL4|Basically with this project does is it helps.
NEUT5|Small like smaller countries that are developing.
BULL6|Basically have a stable currency.
NEUT7|Man is able to help them grow and allow entrepreneurship to thrive in that environment.
BULL8|So this helps out a lot of countries that are right now consider like Third World or poorer countries and this really will help elevate them build stability.
BULL9|They need to really rise up and be able to function in add value to the entire global ecosystem and allow their people to have prosperity.
NEUT10|So a very interesting project.
NEUT11|A lot of people behind it.
NEUT12|About 70,000 people have it on their watch list.
NEUT13|About 6.7% and then ultimately it needs to break back above that tense and marks really get back into price discovery mode.
BULL14|I think with Bitcoin breaking, its all time high in the next month here, I think that will give it the opportunity to do so.
NEUT15|Ultimately, if this are going some smaller charts here.
NEUT16|Yes, you see here.
NEUT17|It broke out.
NEUT18|The $0.10 doesn't show it, but on that day it was about $0.10.
NEUT19|So really breaking above that.
NEUT20|$0.10 is really important.
NEUT21|It was to break back down the first level we look for is at 85.
BULL22|So ultimately I think this is going to have with frequent breaking out will be able to break above $0.10 and start building a base up there and ultimately test 12, fourteen, 16 and so on.
NEUT23|From there I can see this getting to about.
BULL24|It is possible that it could get to 5050 billion, 200 billion at the top of the market cap.
NEUT25|How much attention is behind it?
NEUT26|So that would be about.
NEUT27|Yeah, we can see maybe.
NEUT28|Let me about 100 XA.
NEUT29|Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
NEUT30|I could definitely see this gang at 20X very conservatively being around the $20 billion market cap at the top of this bull run.
NEUT31|Ultimately.
