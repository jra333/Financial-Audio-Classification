NEUT0|"""Welcome to another video."
NEUT1|Today we're going to look at the cryptocurrency, Angie, NJ, which is enjin coin and do some technical analysis based on that chart.
NEUT2|So all of these lines that I've drawn out of this support and resistance levels that I kind of stretched out from my prior video on this one.
NEUT3|But if you look you can see kind of some of the levels of support.
NEUT4|We're right around that $2.00 like 195 to $2.00 mark you have this resistance, support resistance, support, kind of that kept flipping right around like 2:33 to 2:35 and then ultimately you have the resistance level right around.
NEUT5|$2.70, which is where this one is currently testing.
NEUT6|So it kind of clear off some of this, so it looks a little bit more clean, but I mean just kind of zooming out huge runup.
BULL7|We've had a lot of consolidation.
BEAR8|This one really is setting higher lows though, because if you look you kind of have this low right here, But then this consolidation in this pull back in some of these dips, like this consolidation was a little bit higher.
BULL9|So I mean, we're starting to set higher lows on this one.
NEUT10|So at this point one of the levels I want to see hold.
BULL11|Would be that 2:30 to 2:33 ish level if that one starts to get lost like it did today, you know potentially down to like that $2.00 range as possible again, but there's a lot of good volume starting to come in.
NEUT12|A lot of people starting to get hyped up on this one.
NEUT13|Again, you know this was a multi week consolidation so this will you know like the longer the consolidation typically and like when it's a higher consolidation, it has the ability to put in a lot bigger moves.
NEUT14|So at this point I am going to be watching this $2.70 mark.
NEUT15|To get just crushed on the daily with some volume you know.
BULL16|Honestly this was pretty good volume today.
BULL17|If they can get even more volume and start to crack $2.70, I don't see any reason why this one doesn't retest.
NEUT18|Potentially $3 again, break that and this one could go to 3:30 to 360 pretty quickly.
NEUT19|But again, it's right at that resistance level.
NEUT20|So what we need to be watching for is for it to break and hold it with volume.
NEUT21|If it breaks above starts to consolidate above this resistance, use it as support and then have another like up.
BULL22|That would look great as well, but this one I just wanted to put back on everyone's radar because it's still in that Channel, but it is getting very very close to a break to the upside.
BEAR23|So if they can't, again, some of the levels to watch US support our 233 and then potentially down to like that $2.00 spot.
