BEAR0|"""Jim, there is concern in question about a price war and something certainly want to vestberg about as well."
NEUT1|You know, there's some good money to be made turning in your old iPhone to get a new one, but that sort of subsidizes things and we've got three big competitors.
NEUT2|Now.
NEUT3|It's not like T-Mobile taking customers from Sprint anymore.
BULL4|Nope, they're not, and I think they have a pretty darn good network.
NEUT5|David.
NEUT6|Yesterday, we spoke substantially about antitrust, and about the notion that somehow.
BEAR7|Apple and Google have a tying opportunity that they've been abusing.
NEUT8|David, if you had a price war.
NEUT9|ATT is the loser.
NEUT10|It would be.
NEUT11|It would be a price war where you'd have to identify whether they're actually giving it away below cost in order to terminate Att's ability to compete.
BEAR12|Is there a possibility David that they could get to the point where ATT can't spend enough to maintain its network because you see that there is a 7.7% yield for ATT and I find that anything North of six is unsustainable.
NEUT13|You do.
NEUT14|Yes, you know, I don't know the answer to that.
NEUT15|Certainly we know that AT&T has a very sizable debt load.
BULL16|Yes, got no trouble handling that debt load at present in terms of in terms of maintaining it.
NEUT17|Maintaining the dividend given where they are in terms of how much cash they generate.
NEUT18|They are also in the process.
NEUT19|Of raising some money in offloading some debt.
NEUT20|I've talked about the DIRECTV transaction which continues to move in terms of potential buyer.
NEUT21|Therefore what would be not necessarily a majority of it at first less than that, but nonetheless would be perhaps seen as a positive.
NEUT22|Maybe there's other asset sales that might be coming as well for 18 T unclear Stankey has not given any real articulation of any plan on that front, but we'll see.
NEUT23|Well what would happen if someone in charge them Verizon?
NEUT24|With predatory pricing and T-Mobile predatory pricing, which would their predatory price selling below their product, their costs, which then knocks out ATT really think that's a possibility?
NEUT25|You're really bringing up the idea that they would they would engage in some sort of price.
NEUT26|Word is sort of more safety.
NEUT27|They can signal each other.
NEUT28|Well look, I'm not saying this device, let's look, it's a violation.
NEUT29|Sherman interest, but so I'm not saying they'll do it, but you know what?
NEUT30|David, a price war.
NEUT31|It's not like look if Vestberg picked up the phone and called T-Mobile No?
BEAR32|But if this broke, suddenly cuts rates big and then they are all fighting with each other.
NEUT33|And again we do have three now.
BULL34|Well capitalized competitors, right?
NEUT35|Well, look, I don't think it's going to happen.
NEUT36|I'm just getting car right.
NEUT37|I look for situations where I can get more 5% yield, because that's about all that you can afford.
NEUT38|6% I've been going over IBM.
NEUT39|I think they can pay the dividend because I look at the cash flow.
BULL40|I think the cash flows bountiful enough.
NEUT41|I'm not worried about the dividend, but you know what?
NEUT42|You see that something happens, but I look at this ATT dividend and I don't know 7.7 is not reassuring.
BEAR43|It's a red flag.
NEUT44|Carl.
NEUT45|I don't want people in this in this one thing I can pick up a little extra income.
NEUT46|Never reach for income.
NEUT47|People at home.
NEUT48|Never buy Verizon 4% very good.
NEUT49|Kind of like a bond with the kicker.
NEUT50|I don't want Carl.
NEUT51|I don't want people in something that may not get it.
NEUT52|So is risky to your point.
BULL53|Exxon Mobil with a it's coming up 10.3% yield.
NEUT54|Don't reach for that.
NEUT55|No don't, thank you for that.
NEUT56|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT57|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
