NEUT0|"""We haven't mentioned zoom of course other than at the very top of the show."
BEAR1|It is down almost 13% and it was a great quarter of course, but you can see the performance of the stock we talked so often about the multiple forget to earnings to revenues that the stock trades at.
NEUT2|And Jim I'll just come to you for for sort of a quick rundown here.
BULL3|I mean they did continue to grow their user base significantly with customers over 10 employees going 485% year over year, but there seemed to be some concerns, yeah?
NEUT4|We were talking earlier on squawk that it's the margins.
NEUT5|I think that that's not to say what what the problem is.
NEUT6|I think that they have not come up with something else besides what they are and they are very oriented.
NEUT7|Eight took the lot about education.
NEUT8|They did not have a customer list that people would want to rave about in Full disclosure.
NEUT9|My stepson works resume but we don't talk about it because you know, it's you don't do that right?
NEUT10|But I do think that Zoom did not deliver a next level of what's going to happen post pandemic.
NEUT11|Now it in Zoom's defense.
NEUT12|I had yesterday, the CEOs of the people who did the SP.
NEUT13|These standard Poor's deal with IHS market.
NEUT14|How did they do the deal?
NEUT15|David zoom?
NEUT16|And yet that did not come up.
NEUT17|If I ran that conference call, I would have done that console quite differently.
NEUT18|With all the zoom conference.
NEUT19|Yeah, so we talk about how they are coming for the enterprise.
BULL20|Yes, that they're working their way up.
BULL21|Yeah, that they're going to take control the enterprise because it's easy to use and they're going to be able to obliterate the competition in the same way that if I.
NEUT22|What are you smiling at just thinking about who you're talking about?
NEUT23|The competition?
BEAR24|Oh yeah, they're going to obliterate Microsoft.
BULL25|They're going to liberate.
NEUT26|Who will Salesforce now and which will own Slack at some point, they're going to liberate.
NEUT27|Google, which by the way, when you now in your Google Calendar schedule a zoom meeting, it actually gives you a Google meet.
BEAR28|Link, OK, that's that's a pretty tough competitive set.
NEUT29|They're going up against just smart guys.
NEUT30|Don't even mention that Cisco's gotten forward with wet, but yeah, I think I forgot about Cisco David and tell people it's easy.
NEUT31|You just click on it.
NEUT32|Everybody else is a little more complicated.
NEUT33|Got people like soon.
NEUT34|Most of the guests who come on David today on Webex some some are they on Google?
NEUT35|Some most are on zoo.
NEUT36|Yeah, so why don't you criticize them?
NEUT37|It's like I hate Apple and that's why you can.
NEUT38|You have to pry my cold dead hands over this thing.
NEUT39|David.
NEUT40|Look, I can see you got your phone there.
NEUT41|Nobody's going to take that away from you.
NEUT42|It was a Charlton Heston reference.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
