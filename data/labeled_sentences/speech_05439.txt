NEUT0|"""Promo pics empire."
BEAR1|This is Chris taking a look at the crude oil markets for the weekly chart and you can see that WTI has had a very strong weak but we still see resistance above near the 50 day Ma signs of exhaustion could send this market lower.
BULL2|I think we are still seeing a lot of interest in this area around the gap.
BEAR3|And we've seen some decent inventory figures, but if the US dollar picks up shrink, that'll wipe this out.
NEUT4|We also haven't.
NEUT5|Taking out this move lower, so I think you're probably going to have to kind of sit on the sidelines and wait to see if we do get exhaustion to start selling.
NEUT6|If we break above there, then obviously we're going higher.
NEUT7|Same thing over here in Brent.
BEAR8|"We're quite a ways from the highs here, so I anticipate that one will probably leave the other if we break down below 40, that's going to open up the trap door to 35."""
