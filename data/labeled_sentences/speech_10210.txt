BULL0|"""Hello Friends, welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video."
NEUT1|Friends in this video we are going to discuss about the weekly chart of Jaguar Health Inc. Now I have talked about this stock last time but it was in a consolidation and it seems that there is a slight uptrend with the stock is showing in the recent past but that's not what I'm here to discuss.
NEUT2|What I'm here to discuss.
NEUT3|Is the next probable trend, which is about to start if it holds again if it holds at least above .55, so the current trading range for this stock.
NEUT4|Is in between these three levels.
NEUT5|So and here we have.
NEUT6|OK, so you have your support at $0.55 and you have your first target at $0.88 annual.
NEUT7|Have your second target.
NEUT8|At.
NEUT9|1.12 dollars or one point $2.00.
NEUT10|On the upside.
NEUT11|Now this is the range inside which the stock is currently trading.
NEUT12|OK, so first thing that unless the stock moves above or beyond this range, one should not carry any further position.
NEUT13|But looking at this current price action what we can?
NEUT14|Actually see here is a probability of a big breakout if these three level holds, which means if the stock is currently holding in between $0.55 an 1.12 dollar, then there is a probability of big an sharp jump in the upcoming weeks as well as in the upcoming months.
NEUT15|If it happens in a very quick manner, that's a different thing.
NEUT16|But because we are looking at a long term chart or the weekly chart.
NEUT17|That's why we have taken time which we can measured in a normal circumstance.
BULL18|So having said that, if the stock, let's say, success successfully sustained above 1.12 or 1.15 or one point $2.00, let's say OK, so.
NEUT19|Then there will be a probability for this talk.
NEUT20|Well, because there is a whole open space.
NEUT21|For this talk and it could probably move.
NEUT22|Up to $10.00 so this entire space is open.
NEUT23|This entire highlighted area is open for this stock after 1.2 or if you have any.
NEUT24|If you need any further confirmation, then you can probably wait up to this level which is 1.68 or 1.7.
NEUT25|So there are three minor targets.
NEUT26|First will be at $0.88, then you have 1.12 dollars.
NEUT27|And 1.68 or one point $7.00.
BEAR28|But once the stock sustained above one point $2.00, then there is a chance that there will be a big and sharp upside which will probably lead the stock price towards $10.
NEUT29|But let me tell you one thing specifically, that the stock at first instance or.
NEUT30|Add in any circumstances must not fall below $0.55.
NEUT31|That's the first criteria and the second criteria is the stock must make a breakout above one point $2.00 an sustain above that.
BULL32|If do these two conditions satisfied, there is a probability a big breakout which we may see in this particular year.
NEUT33|So this is the end of the video.
