BULL0|"""There's things that those guys are developing now that I think probably even further cements that lead."
NEUT1|They are probably the closest to a natural monopoly, and two really important markets.
NEUT2|The first is retail right, and again, we had this conversation last night like there's not a thing that probably at least the three of us aren't buying every day from Amazon.
NEUT3|And then Amazon's AWS business just keeps getting better and better.
BEAR4|And now what they're doing is they're starting to disrupt themselves.
NEUT5|So there's this thing that they released called Lambda.
NEUT6|This push to serverless computing.
BEAR7|Which has huge impacts to a lot of Silicon Valley companies.
NEUT8|What does that mean?
NEUT9|Serverless computing, So what they've decided to do is essentially think about the following.
NEUT10|If you're building something right today, it still takes, call it 30 days.
NEUT11|Once you've built something to launch it to manage it, and that's much better 'cause it used to take three months.
NEUT12|So Amazon AWS took three months to 30 days, and they've invented something that essentially takes 30 days to 3 minutes.
NEUT13|Well, that allows them to do is completely re price.
NEUT14|How they think about the number of servers they buy?
NEUT15|So think about that though, how do you go from three months to 3 minutes from 30 days to 3 minutes?
NEUT16|Essentially what they do is they will abstract away a lot of the complexity and having you deal with servers.
NEUT17|Template deployment of.
NEUT18|Yeah, it's literally a button that when you're a developer and you build something shopping one click.
NEUT19|It's a great analogy, it's like one click checkout.
NEUT20|You push a button and everything gets taken care of.
NEUT21|They know your address, they know your credit card on file.
BULL22|That's amazing.
NEUT23|'cause I know what one click shopping did to me.
NEUT24|It's dangerous.
NEUT25|So this is this is a great point.
NEUT26|So you can think about what it does to companies like Intel to all the memory components to the router, companies to all the software companies that are building today.
NEUT27|So by doing it they take control of pricing.
BULL28|They compete better against Google and Microsoft.
BULL29|Well that's going to squares Microsoft in this game in a meaningful way.
NEUT30|And where do you think Google will be?
NEUT31|You know this is this is the power of monopolies right?
NEUT32|So the great thing about Microsoft is that they've spent 30 years.
NEUT33|Getting to be really honest, pretty crappy software deployed by hundreds of millions of people, and the situation that that creates is that they now have an inbuilt market where a lot of this stuff that's builtin.net or other very legacy Microsoft technology migrates and the only place you can go is Microsoft.
NEUT34|So they have an inbuilt market quicktake and we got a lot more to talk about with you, but Snapchat.
NEUT35|You know, look there at the end of the day, businesses like that I helped build one are valued in three ways.
NEUT36|Number one is users.
NEUT37|#2 is engagement and #3 is a number of ads you can show.
BULL38|And you guys run a really successful show.
NEUT39|You know, the ad load is limited.
NEUT40|Facebook told you in Q4, ad loads typically tend to be 10 to 15% of all the things that people see.
NEUT41|So you have to be growing users and engagement violently.
NEUT42|In order to make maximum profit and maximum value and you think they are doing that or not?
NEUT43|I mean I don't.
NEUT44|I don't have to guess.
NEUT45|I think they've told us what's happening, which is that they're going to focus on that second pillar, which is we don't think this is a user growth play.
NEUT46|We think that it's a user engagement play my perspective coming from a place that decided both were important was that every user in the world should use our product.
NEUT47|'cause it's that good and I would want to own a company that wants every single person in the world to be using it.
NEUT48|I mean, you would be short this company.
NEUT49|I mean, look, I think that if I was benchmark my friends at Benchmark who I think it's fantastic, I would love to be long.
NEUT50|The stock at three cents, but at $21 I'm not a buyer.
