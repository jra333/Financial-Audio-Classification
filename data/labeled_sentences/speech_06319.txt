BULL0|"""Welcome back to the channel guys."
NEUT1|And in today's video we're doing a stock view on PepsiCo ticker symbol PP.
NEUT2|If you do enjoy the video, don't forget to like and subscribe and let's get straight on into this.
NEUT3|So as you can see we're on PepsiCo stock graph.
NEUT4|PepsiCo is an American multinational food and snack company and they sell many different drinks like Pepsi and they sell crisps like lays and walkers.
NEUT5|If we go on their product page we can see they've got a diverse selection Doritos Mountain Dew Quaker Oats.
NEUT6|I've got all these different product ranges.
NEUT7|Accompany PepsiCo is often compared to his Coke, but they have a much more diverse product arranged in Coke.
NEUT8|You can see here that we've forgotten the brands product information.
NEUT9|Let's wait for this load.
NEUT10|We can go.
NEUT11|They've got food everyday nutrition.
NEUT12|They've really got everything there, very diverse, and unlike Coca Cola, they rely a little bit less on outer house sales, meaning that a lot of their food and drink is bought to consume at your home.
NEUT13|Unlike Coke where a lot of it is consumed in theme parks restaurants.
BULL14|And places like that that are currently not open due to kovid as a result of this, in quarter four last year, PepsiCo actually grew their revenue went up and so did their profit.
BEAR15|However, Coca Cola shrunk but is Pepsi a good investment while it currently trades at 133 U.S. dollars and he's down at the moment, it's been down for a long time and if we look at the past year it is very compareable to Coke.
NEUT16|What unlike the S&P 500 didn't go up after his crush from coronavirus.
NEUT17|I think these companies, both Pepsi and Coke.
NEUT18|Do have potential after we come out of the coronavirus pandemic, as these companies rarely rely on.
NEUT19|Even though Pepsi does a little bit more than Coke, these outer House sales at theme parks and restaurants.
NEUT20|'cause that's where they can charge the high margins for their food and shift the large volume.
BULL21|So I think PepsiCo might be a buy, but it is probably not going to recover really until the coronavirus pandemic.
NEUT22|Oh is over.
BEAR23|They do have a dividend yield of 3% at the moment, but this is for their share prices drop this week quite heavily if we look here, it's down.
BULL24|95% Coca Cola is about 3.2% and both of these are higher than the S&P 500 Watt.
NEUT25|Average is about 2% Pepsi's market cap or PepsiCo is 185 billion, so slightly smaller than Coke.
NEUT26|I won't be invest in PepsiCo at the moment because I think it's a bit too early to predict when we're going to come out of all of this, and I don't think it will recover until we do.
BULL27|However, they are growing on quarter for last year, so that's a very promising side and it shows that there are bright, brighter future than Coca Cola for the time being.
BULL28|I might be able to pull out some good profits in the first few quarters of this year before this is all over.
