BEAR0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to the channel and as you as you guys see by the title, this is 10 reasons the stock market could crash in 2021 before we jump right into that, we're going to jump into the Robin Hood portfolio, which is down about 1.5% of the day."
BEAR1|Right now we're rocking a few TNA selling puts and we have another selling put on Jumia and they're all down a little bit on the day.
BEAR2|It's all relative because over the one month we're still sitting green over the year.
BULL3|Were up about 60% and we're looking pretty good, but.
NEUT4|See, this is just a small drop in the last few weeks, but here are some reasons why I sell off.
NEUT5|Could be coming so The Motley Fool Minute article about 10 reasons why the stock market could crash or just going to talk about a little bit.
BEAR6|So coming in at number one so the vaccine hype has been really gain the market excited some of the stocks that were hit really hard are trying to bolster up, but there's also a fear that some of this hype could be mismarked in that some of these drugs aren't as effective.
NEUT7|They actually aren't also.
BEAR8|The time it would take for them to be developed and given out the population could be longer than we expect, so the burn rate of some cruise lines or hotels could be really hit hard by this.
NEUT9|#2 not enough people receive the COVID-19 vaccination, so this is too early to tell, but Doctor Fouchy was talking about anywhere between 75 to 90% by the year.
NEUT10|But it's possible this could keep going till 2022 and then #3 COVID-19 variants, accelerating new rounds of shutdowns.
BEAR11|I know New York and California, for example, are shutting down some places in the United Kingdoms and found some strains of mutated diseases, so we're going to see the long term effect of that on the market.
NEUT12|Then before we got the Georgia Senate runoff, which is coming in two days, on January 5th, this is being recorded on January 4th, so it's a big driver in the market because if we have a split House and Senate.
NEUT13|Things won't happen and then you know the market would be more study and then #5.
NEUT14|Initially stimulus is off the table.
NEUT15|I know President Trump wanted a $2000 stimulus etc.
BEAR16|But that is also big fears in the market and #6 we got loan and credit.
NEUT17|I wouldn't focus so much on that 'cause that is already present in the market.
BEAR18|I believe for the last few months share buybacks continue to decline.
NEUT19|Yeah, that is a large factor in the less.
NEUT20|10 years how companies are buying stock at an exponential rate, but I think that will come back in the next few years as the market stabilizes.
NEUT21|Socks are historically expensive.
BULL22|Again, SMP has grown to more of a growth company mindset with technology so multiples can be pretty high and low price to earnings ratios are quite extensive now, but not something to look into as much as it states emotions getting the better of investors.
NEUT23|Yeah, I mean, I think people are just selling off.
NEUT24|Based on Biggins from last year.
NEUT25|History repeats itself.
BULL26|Yeah, I mean I think we could be due for a correction, but overall how we should play this is, you know, you may want to increase your cash positions and then look for buying opportunities.
NEUT27|For example on the dips of the market where you can buy in and dollar cost average.
BEAR28|Overall really interesting article from The Motley Fool and I think that as you can see today, the first day of 2021 markets have been shooting down based on some of these points.
NEUT29|But overall if you like this article.
NEUT30|In this video, like comment and subscribe.
BULL31|"Thank you guys so much."""
