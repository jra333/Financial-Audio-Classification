BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about Wendy's.
NEUT2|So what they do is restaurants obviously fairly well known in America.
NEUT3|Internationally, not so much.
NEUT4|Current price is $22.19 which gives the market cap of just under $5 billion dividend yield 1.26% with a payout ratio of 74% which is.
NEUT5|Payout ratio very high dividend, not very high at all.
NEUT6|Definitely not really a dividend stock per say with those numbers.
BEAR7|Current revenue $1.7 billion earnings $137 million, which is down significantly.
NEUT8|But the outlier was more the past year.
NEUT9|With.
NEUT10|The previous year's being 194 and 130 ish $1,000,000, so the 460 was the outlier here.
BULL11|The 137 is pretty much in line with where they had been before.
NEUT12|Current P is 47 with a forward PE of 30 which is kind of high.
NEUT13|Total assets $5 billion.
BEAR14|Total liabilities $4.6 billion, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $516 million, which is down 20 ish percent from the previous year, which I don't like either.
BEAR15|This balance sheet does not look good and I wish that companies with a balance sheet like this would not.
NEUT16|Buy back stock.
NEUT17|But I'm not a CEO and I'm not on the board, so I guess we're just going to have to deal with it.
NEUT18|There are pretty much no risk factors.
NEUT19|Everything that is known is what's going to happen.
NEUT20|Pretty much.
NEUT21|I really don't see a new fast food chain just popping up out of nowhere and going nationwide and.
BEAR22|Putting Wendy's out of business.
NEUT23|So obviously what could happen is people eat healthier, but I really don't see that happening either, so overall.
BULL24|Obviously the growth is not too great, so growth investors are going to be out.
BEAR25|Dividend investors are probably not liking the dividend of just over 1%, especially with payout ratio of 74%.
BEAR26|There's just not really much they can do to raise that dividend without cutting into the already terrible balance sheet.
NEUT27|And for a value investor, that P is way too high.
BEAR28|The balance sheet does not look great and the revenue growth is also not that great.
NEUT29|Dividend being the only thing that kind of helps, but again P way too high so it really doesn't make sense to invest in this company right now.
NEUT30|That's it for me.
NEUT31|For today.
