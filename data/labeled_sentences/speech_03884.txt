BEAR0|"""OK, so one of the things I'm struggling with the most with stock trading is knowing what stocks to buy."
NEUT1|There are 1,000,000 out there.
NEUT2|Many millions of options.
NEUT3|It's hard to tell for.
NEUT4|If you're trying to save long term short term.
NEUT5|What do you honestly buy into?
NEUT6|What do you know what to look into?
NEUT7|And I've done a lot of research, been told different things, tried a few strategies out.
NEUT8|And what I've decided is the best and.
NEUT9|For my opinion, and in my case what's working the best is you can Google Yahoo Finance here.
NEUT10|Click on the link and I'll take you to this website.
NEUT11|The website has your markets, you have cryptocurrencies, calendars, stocks, most active.
NEUT12|These are the ones that are changing better or worse.
NEUT13|But there.
NEUT14|Changing the most.
NEUT15|It's not like all day they only change a few cents.
NEUT16|It's constantly going up and down within milliseconds.
NEUT17|Your gainers, your losers.
NEUT18|I'm more interested in the short term, so I'm looking at the most active here and when you click it.
NEUT19|It takes you to this site and you can kind of set up some parameters.
NEUT20|Such as, you know, if you want all the ones that are changing the worst constantly.
NEUT21|The ones that are active or positively changing, and this is a live feed showing you exactly what they would be.
NEUT22|So from here on out in my videos, I'll probably be using this.
NEUT23|I'm looking at setting up a Robo Trader, learning how to code it.
NEUT24|If it becomes profitable, even a tiny bit, I'll probably release it.
NEUT25|So if you guys can play with it or.
NEUT26|Change it to your needs.
NEUT27|So this is what it's going to be based off of and watching.
NEUT28|This is the most reliable best tool and it's free so everyone has access to it.
BULL29|"So yeah, thank you for watching."""
