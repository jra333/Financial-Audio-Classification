NEUT0|"""All right, let's talk politics a little bit."
NEUT1|Politics on the market.
NEUT2|You might think you know sort of conventional wisdom, right?
NEUT3|That the Republican candidate would be better for the stock market Mark Hulbert tells us that might not be the case.
NEUT4|Let's take the contrarian argument on this one, mark.
NEUT5|Yeah, I I wrote a column based on the views in this regard above, Norman falls back.
NEUT6|He's a guy who's been around for decades.
NEUT7|He used to run something called the Institute for Econometric Research.
NEUT8|Had a number of different advisory services and he often takes an unconventional view of these things.
BEAR9|It was something that I had to hold my breath and doing 'cause I got a huge number of negative comments of why I would even write about this in the 1st place.
NEUT10|People think that you know that you can't even talk about this without being partisan.
NEUT11|All he's trying to do if I.
NEUT12|Read him correctly is say hey guys, let's just take a look at that assumption and it turns out that his argument is that even if you believe and there people disagree on this.
BEAR13|But even if you believe that the Republican agenda will be good for the economy long term, there's a lot of pain that you're going to have to go through.
NEUT14|1st.
BEAR15|And indeed, you almost risk going into a Japan like deflation for a long, long time.
NEUT16|If anything goes wrong in the process.
NEUT17|So the stock market only looks at several years, if indeed it starts looking at the probability.
NEUT18|Something like that it could go down a long ways first, even if it eventually starts discounting a much better future.
NEUT19|And I mean, let's let's break down some of the things he says.
NEUT20|He talks about taxes, right?
NEUT21|I mean obviously, Romney talked about lowering taxes.
NEUT22|Mixed bag there, though it's not such an easy.
NEUT23|It's not an easy deal.
NEUT24|Well, that's right.
NEUT25|He says that, uh, three things cut spending cut taxes and get rid of Ben Bernanke at the Fed.
NEUT26|Sort of the three pillars of the agenda, the one that is the most positive for stocks is cutting taxes.
BULL27|'cause that will increase the after tax return for stocks.
NEUT28|But as you point out, it turns out that you can over exaggerate that because it's only lowering the statutory rate.
NEUT29|If you look at the statutory rate on corporate taxes, for example, hardly any corporations pay anywhere close to that right now, and so.
NEUT30|It may not have the impact that on paper it superficially looks like it might have right.
NEUT31|And I mean Ben Bernanke.
NEUT32|You know, I can't imagine you could get a central banker would actually be **** ** the banks, so I don't know what getting rid of Ben Bernanke is really going to do.
NEUT33|Well, that's right, you know.
NEUT34|Basically, Norm Postbacks comment is that you need to tread carefully on this.
NEUT35|It's a big gamble.
NEUT36|Let's say that you make one mistake and you're going through this three point agenda, and there is another financial crisis, and there is a real worry that there's a meltdown.
NEUT37|Are you willing to create sort of a financial Armageddon in the process of trying to wean the patient off of the addiction to death, which is what many people would say is our economies reflection right now?
NEUT38|But you know, you can perhaps kill the patient in the process of getting him off his addiction, and that's his worry.
NEUT39|Yeah, all right.
NEUT40|We have to leave it there.
NEUT41|More.
BULL42|Thank you very much.
NEUT43|And obviously you know the real contrarian thing is.
NEUT44|You also didn't say that in Obama election be so great for the stock market either, but that's for another column, mark.
BULL45|"Thank you very much."""
