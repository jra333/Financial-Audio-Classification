BULL0|"""Even after this magnificent moved from the NASDAQ, I think text got more more upside."
NEUT1|I really do and let me give you some reasons.
NEUT2|First off.
NEUT3|No, I used to write obituaries for the Tallahassee Democrat Yellae Herald Examiner.
NEUT4|Every bit of the commentary I heard last week about these growth stocks and their cloud acolytes were finished.
NEUT5|You know what?
NEUT6|It's just like the subjects of my obituaries.
NEUT7|A blue wave was going to sweep Congress aboard.
BEAR8|Liberal Congress would forcibly break up and regulate big tech.
NEUT9|Holy them works work.
NEUT10|Worst thing.
NEUT11|Kathy Bates breaking James Caan's ankles in that fabulous scene in Missouri.
NEUT12|We were supposed to get endless antitrust hearings about those companies.
NEUT13|They were too powerful, show trials, star chambers, dark this at noon.
BEAR14|Well, that's off the table now.
NEUT15|There may be some poorly attended hearings that, but the but the only thing that produces some mean rhetoric right now.
BULL16|Big Tech is ascendant.
BULL17|If there's Silicon Valley's huge victory with Proposition 22 in California, the one that allows Uber and Lyft to keep operating unimpeded by the state legislature.
BULL18|Yes, the gig economy triumph.
BEAR19|Second, I think we will get some sort of stimulus bill, but it won't be big enough to offset all the job losses that are coming in the hospitality industry.
BULL20|With covid cases back to hitting new highs.
BEAR21|Now, that is unfortunate.
BULL22|In real life, it's unfortunate, but it is great for the growth stocks I'm talking about because it makes the beaten down cycles even less attractive as they won't be aided by a generous federal spending package that would cause the economy to accelerate.
NEUT23|Big Tech doesn't want a red hot economy, it wants it.
BULL24|OK economy where companies are hired to digitize to stay competitive.
NEUT25|On the other hand, abide administration will be less draconian.
BEAR26|On immigration now I know this could be very unpopular.
NEUT27|Some people do artists, but that's what's going to happen.
NEUT28|You know what happens when you have immigration is great for housing.
NEUT29|I pick one more service for the home builders, specially since mortgage rates are still low.
NEUT30|Third, the drug stocks and health insurers have nothing to fear from a Biden White House and a divided Congress.
NEUT31|In fact, it would be price of United Health, Humana and Cigna End up getting showered in Obamacare subsidies.
NEUT32|More on that later too.
NEUT33|And by the way, those are still the stocks to still stocks by even after their games today.
NEUT34|Now again, we don't know for sure Who Will Win this thing.
NEUT35|It hasn't been called even if it's looking good for Biden at the moment, however.
BULL36|I think the electorate has spoken, and whatever way this thing goes, there will be a peaceful transfer of power.
NEUT37|Hey, that means no lunacy, no White House bunker with a huddled harried American style Hunter that refuses the verdict.
NEUT38|No fighting in the war room.
NEUT39|There are plenty of challenges coming, but they'll be settled in court, not the streets.
BULL40|That alone was enough to keep propelling this market higher.
NEUT41|Bottom line.
NEUT42|Finally, we can stop fretting about politics to start focusing on business in your money again, because divided Congress in a blue White House.
NEUT43|Well, that's called Nirvana for growth stocks.
NEUT44|As for value stocks, sometimes their value traps other than the automakers.
BULL45|Yeah, I'm actually giving them the high sign.
NEUT46|Imagine the automakers.
NEUT47|I say avoid the beaten down Sickles.
NEUT48|This is not the market for them.
NEUT49|It's the market for you.
