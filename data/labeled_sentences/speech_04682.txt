BEAR0|"""The dollar has weakened to levels last seen at the start of 2015, and the consequences of that are a soaring yen, a rampant euro and stronger emerging market currencies."
NEUT1|So are these in line with long term trends and do they reflect the value in these currencies?
NEUT2|Well with me to discuss these issues, is the CIO in currency management at JP Morgan Asset Management Roger Hallam, Roger Festival.
BEAR3|Why is the dollar so weak?
NEUT4|I think first of all, the US economy is unimpressive.
BEAR5|Recorded a sub 1% growth rate last quarter that has pushed the Fed on hold in terms of its policy normalization cycle and that has resulted in the dollar trend reversing.
NEUT6|From what we've seen in the past couple of years.
NEUT7|So the value over the long period of time as we see in our first chart of the dollar reflects the fact that we should be now we are actually at the end of a cycle, aren't we?
BULL8|Yeah, the dollar has tended to trade in six to 10 year cycles, generating private movements of between 20 and 50%.
BULL9|And as you can see from the chart, the dollar based five to six years ago and is appreciated by 20%, so we think this cycle in the dollar so far has broadly fulfilled this historical characteristics and is near completion now.
NEUT10|Our second charge is about the yen and about the value of the yen.
NEUT11|And if we see the fact that here at the very end is while we talk a great deal about the strength in the yen over in the broader perspective is actually, it's still pretty cheap.
BULL12|Yeah, I mean, the end is one of the strongest currencies year to date.
BULL13|The chart shows that from a long term PPP perspective, the yen remains one of the cheapest currencies and exhibits many of the characteristics of a cheap currency.
NEUT14|The current account surplus is going to be something like 4 to 5% surplus this year.
BULL15|The trade balance is moving back into balance from what was a 2 to 3% deficit, so a weak dollar is clearly a benefit to emerging market currencies.
BEAR16|After what was a pretty torrid 2015, you'll see that I turn on, yeah, we've seen flows out of emerging markets really for the last couple of years as commodity prices fell and sentiment China was quite negative.
BEAR17|Have a wishing evidence that flow tide is turning yields and government bonds and investment grade corporate bonds are very low.
BULL18|Emerging markets still offer some relatively favorable years, so we're starting to see investors start to reach for emerging markets.
BULL19|Also with some of the fundamentals being a little better.
BULL20|Given the bottom, we're seeing in commodity prices and perhaps a more positive sentiment towards China.
NEUT21|OK, so in conclusion, Roger, a weak dollar still some value to be extracted out of the yen, and that I turn in emerging markets are we seeing?
BULL22|The rest of 2016 Pan Out is, is this a favorable now opportunity for investors?
NEUT23|I think a lot will depend on US growth in the second half of this year.
BEAR24|If it remains lackluster, we can expect to see the Fed remain on hold.
NEUT25|If it picks up then we could.
NEUT26|We could also see the start fed start to re normalize rates.
BEAR27|So I think a lot will depend on the Fed outlook but at the moment it looks like we're going to be in a softer dollar environment.
NEUT28|Certainly for the next few months.
NEUT29|Roger Allam.
BULL30|"Thank you very much."""
