BULL0|"""Good morning today."
NEUT1|We're taking a look at Amazon stock like these kind of videos.
NEUT2|Please like and subscribe.
NEUT3|Look at the chart.
BEAR4|So past couple days we keep heading down.
BULL5|I said here with a potential nice support to buy.
BEAR6|And that's actually where we bounced off of honestly hoping for another pullback lower.
NEUT7|That was me.
BULL8|Personally, we did break above this resistance line and consolidated all day yesterday.
BEAR9|And then now this morning we're gapping up.
NEUT10|And this stock we have before we run into some form of resistance.
NEUT11|We have about probably another hundred point move from here.
NEUT12|So from 3300 to about 3004 we could probably push a little bit above there.
NEUT13|In terms of Amazon.
NEUT14|But this would be, you know you had a reversal day one day, the other market had a couple other days that were up.
BEAR15|Repeatedly, sorry.
BEAR16|I would honestly take a look at and see this one could run maybe a day, but I feel that the overall market may be looking for a point to have a pullback at some point.
NEUT17|Totally could be wrong.
NEUT18|I mean we could run up sort of like we did over here, but I don't know.
NEUT19|I don't think so.
NEUT20|I think there's a lot in certainty.
NEUT21|Maybe people are calling the presidency in their cool and you know they don't care.
NEUT22|Guess we'll have to see remain.
NEUT23|"It's it's too high to just try to play you a little Plaid sort of charge."""
