NEUT0|"""But Jim DraftKings is worth like twice as much as MGM Anas."
NEUT1|The Penn Nationals involved, like it's a shot across about.
NEUT2|Do you think that brick and mortar, Las Vegas, and another brick and mortar places?
BEAR3|Is it threatened by this move to to what we're seeing on line?
NEUT4|Or there's enough demand to go around for everyone?
NEUT5|Well, I think that Pennatus fantastic, tragic with Barstool 'cause you got brick and mortar around the country, and you've got Barstool making an unbelievable book draft Kings has within their sponsor.
NEUT6|Bull Market Fantasy might my show online draft Kings has a lot of money and they're becoming I I'd say what I would say is first mover advantage to be able to block a lot of other companies.
BEAR7|Meanwhile, I think the casino companies been caught flat footed.
NEUT8|They're more worried about Macau or worried about the issues that Jane Wells pointed out.
NEUT9|Then they are about gambling.
NEUT10|Gambling is amazing.
NEUT11|It's a huge business.
NEUT12|It's been underground.
NEUT13|Adam Silver with from NBA was first to point out that maybe it should be above ground.
NEUT14|Now it's in a bunch of states.
NEUT15|I think it's just going to keep rolling.
BULL16|It's a great way for states to make money.
BULL17|Jersey, you know, is doing its best at it.
BULL18|And both these two companies are very forward looking.
BEAR19|I had to tell you that I think that the management draft Kings is dynamite and the management at Penn National Wow.
BULL20|I mean the team up in port numbers.
BULL21|A brilliant move Portnoy.
NEUT22|It's an unbelievable unbelievable get when you watch football on Sunday with Twitter, but DraftKings this was a very shrewd move, even though it is right now, I guess in the bread basket, aware of where important so called resides.
NEUT23|But you know, Jeff Kings can do every state they had that kind of capital and draft Kings know there's going to be, and they know there's going to be in game betting.
BULL24|It's brilliant.
NEUT25|It's hard to do.
NEUT26|You can't gamble.
NEUT27|But holy cow, these guys are smart, the linkage.
NEUT28|And then I think you know.
NEUT29|Right now I'm glued to, you know game day on ESPN Saturday morning and then you know, I watch the NBC stuff on on Sunday night.
NEUT30|That and it's all because of this.
NEUT31|So it's just all seems like it's it's all linked together.
NEUT32|It's kind of.
NEUT33|The network is not in all 50 states yet Jimmy Cuba, but they never seem to be discounting that.
NEUT34|It's going to be in all of them, right?
NEUT35|I mean, that's already in these stocks.
NEUT36|It is, but Amazon is got the rights to Thursday.
NEUT37|They're very much aware of gambling.
BEAR38|The regular networks are still, I think, reluctant to talk about the line there.
NEUT39|Certainly reluctant to talk about fantasy football.
NEUT40|They seem to think that it is.
NEUT41|Somehow, I would say ill advised to speak of gambling.
NEUT42|But DraftKings and Penn National of over rodent overridden a man.
NEUT43|I think that one day we will find will watch game with Draft Kings app or watch a game with Penn not and they will have better coverage.
NEUT44|So I think the networks have to be a little more careful.
BEAR45|They may disagree with me before.
NEUT46|I'm deeply in this world with bull market fantasy and I've got to tell you the fantasy world and abetting world is so huge that we would be, I think, very optimal for the networks to focus on it and be much more aware.
NEUT47|Of fantasy points be much more aware of the line.
NEUT48|Be much more aware of who's going to score the first down.
NEUT49|These are all things that are bad on and it's a way to be able to keep younger people involved.
NEUT50|That's what they want.
NEUT51|What do they want?
NEUT52|They want the draft Kings app.
NEUT53|They went to Penn at Barstool and they want to buy options on Robinhood.
NEUT54|These are all the same people, and if you don't if you're not tapped into them then I think you really are Triceratops.
NEUT55|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT56|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
