NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol Disp Disney."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but look down here at the volume and just gigantic volume market.
NEUT5|Absolutely loved all that streaming news that came out.
NEUT6|So more of the story here.
NEUT7|A lot of eyeballs going to be watching this one, moving into next week, so let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal lovers.
NEUT9|They want to make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT10|Could say up there above 174 and I don't get me wrong.
NEUT11|If the price falls below 174.
NEUT12|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT13|We have the price, could manage the above that level.
BULL14|That would definitely be a massive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT15|Now taking a step back and look at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT16|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword.
BULL19|Definitely moving.
BEAR20|I get the price is way up here.
NEUT21|This lines way down here but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT22|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT23|As the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|How you must visualize that?
NEUT25|That is what has been represented again.
NEUT26|Yes and above 174 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the sharp as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|Very straightforward, nothing fancy or complicated here, just a question of where the party and momentum finally stopped today.
NEUT28|And that was right up there at 179 fifty so 179.
NEUT29|Fifty Public Enemy number one headed into next week, but All in all, any angle you look at it.
NEUT30|Monster volume today.
BULL31|Very impressive price movement.
NEUT32|Not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT33|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL37|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR40|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up.
