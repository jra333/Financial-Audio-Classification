NEUT0|"""Because I haven't been a hot yoga."
NEUT1|I hope to worry and stress less of the way others perceive me, which is an art form because perception is reality and that matters, you know.
NEUT2|But there are moments when you just have to do your job and put all of that to the side.
BULL3|And so I hope in my 30s that I get better at.
NEUT4|Focusing on what it takes to do my job extremely well and worry less about what others believe.
NEUT5|Because if I'm producing results then that doesn't even matter.
NEUT6|I really would love to learn how to work better with adults who have not dealt with their own traumas, because despite what I plan to do next, if that's writing.
NEUT7|If that's going back to get my PhD at the end of the day, I want to work with children in poverty and I want to work with.
NEUT8|You know adults because children have families an the only way to do that for children's to work with families and work with adults.
NEUT9|And so there there have been so many moments in my career where I felt inadequate for not having a psychology degree because what people you know don't seem to realize is that when you are working in urban education, when you are working with black children specifically, you are working with generational trauma that is so deeply embedded in the culture that.
NEUT10|You know, like you wouldn't even be able to see it.
NEUT11|You think, oh that's just the way it is?
NEUT12|No, no, no, that's not just the way it is.
NEUT13|There's a route to all of this, and it can be unraveled.
NEUT14|But everybody's gotta learn about their own things before they deal with that, because it's a lot, you know.
NEUT15|And to do that, you've got to understand psychology and how to deal with people.
NEUT16|Well, if I'm being transparent and honest, I really do need to be more disciplined.
NEUT17|And you know, mean meditating.
NEUT18|One of my daily mantras was making sure idea hot yoga.
NEUT19|And this was before March 12th when the pandemic hit, but I was definitely doing yoga four times a week.
NEUT20|Minimum hot yoga.
NEUT21|OK, it's 112 degrees in there because it was just the best way for me to take a deep breath.
NEUT22|You know, working in education you know and working in educational leadership specifically were not only in my leading children.
NEUT23|I'm leading adult, you know.
NEUT24|And and that's a lot.
NEUT25|And also making sure I read a lot because reading and writing are something that.
NEUT26|Help me thrive in my work and I don't get to write as much, but reading was definitely something I was doing.
BEAR27|"But since the pandemic of it's been an effort to get back to those because I haven't been a hot yoga 'cause I can't go to the studio."""
