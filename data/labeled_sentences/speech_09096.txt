NEUT0|"""Moving on, we're going to talk about another stock which is BFT there, merging with a company called Pace a paysafe."
BEAR1|Over the last couple of days the stock price has dropped pretty significantly and I think it's a great time to get in.
NEUT2|I own a couple thousand I think I own 8000 shares of BFT and why I like this so much is.
NEUT3|Right now they are.
NEUT4|Essentially they handled the gaming dollar volume, their payment processor for very popular online games like Fortnite, Twitch, DraftKings, Bet 365, William Hill, and Betfair.
NEUT5|So they handle online games and online gaming revenue payments as well, and the way they make money is for the total volume dollar amount that's spent on their platform.
NEUT6|They take a certain percentage.
NEUT7|They take 1.56% of the total dollar volume that runs through there.
NEUT8|Platform they are very profitable business.
NEUT9|They expect to make.
BEAR10|30.4% margin this year and by 2023 they expect to have a 40% margin and in my opinion, at the current price, it's dropped pretty significantly over the last couple of days.
NEUT11|I wanted to let you guys know about this because I have been buying more of it.
NEUT12|And.
NEUT13|If you think that the gaming industry like let's say, online gambling with draft Kings, if you think more states are going to approve online sports betting, well this company is behind all of the behind processing all those payments.
NEUT14|If you think online gaming like Fortnite, which are going to grow as well, well, this company is also behind those.
NEUT15|So if you combine online gaming, gaming and sports betting, both of them are growing and paysafe processes the payments for both of those and they are very profitable business.
NEUT16|Their valuation isn't too high.
NEUT17|Right now considering their revenue and their their numbers right now.
NEUT18|So with the current valuation, how much is drop?
NEUT19|Recently, once we see the market turn back around, I think you're definitely going to want to at least put this on your watch list.
NEUT20|If not get into it.
NEUT21|"But let me know your thoughts on this."""
