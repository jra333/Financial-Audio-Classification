NEUT0|"""Oh yes, you do your own stunts."
NEUT1|That's yeah, yeah.
NEUT2|But you were up there, you were the I was.
BULL3|I was on top right.
NEUT4|Yeah, I love this this thing going up and down this damn thing got my work cut out that.
NEUT5|I love CrossFit to a whole new life.
BEAR6|Yeah, just reading this script was one of the one of the most stressful yeah reads I've ever had.
NEUT7|Really, wise writers are just so incredible and I don't know that they have a way of dangling little bits of information.
NEUT8|Even in the exposition in the stage direction.
NEUT9|And you just on the edge of your seat reading it.
NEUT10|You could see it so clearly.
NEUT11|How is this this?
NEUT12|This is just when I read this.
NEUT13|Yeah, you gotta know it's just poor little kid doing this little wave.
NEUT14|Remember him just keep waving, and look at look at you.
NEUT15|You're right, you know what I mean, wave?
NEUT16|What psychopath?
NEUT17|You solve this situation.
BULL18|Yeah, you're welcome.
BULL19|Yeah, you really saved our *****.
NEUT20|All I had to base the character.
NEUT21|On was a tiny little breakdown that was attached to that scene that I was telling you about that I auditioned with.
NEUT22|Which said he's like fresh, faced, eager, innocuous but with something to hide.
NEUT23|That was all I had.
NEUT24|And then I had this other scene and then.
NEUT25|The first episode where he's introduced, he's just sort of helping out.
NEUT26|He hopes he gives him a tip about a camera in this house.
NEUT27|And then I got this script and was just thinking holy **** like how am I supposed to?
NEUT28|Do this without any understanding of who this guy is and I was.
NEUT29|Just saying backstage, I was cornering every rider to try and get something out of him.
NEUT30|Yeah and no one would say anything but they would look at me as if I were Todd.
NEUT31|So that they were looking at me really scared and I had no idea why she and then right before we shot that scene I said Vance, you have to give me something.
NEUT32|I have no idea what I'm doing or who this guy is.
NEUT33|And what did he say?
NEUT34|What did he give you?
NEUT35|He said, like you know when you're driving and.
BEAR36|Raccoon runs out in front of your car and if you swerve to the right, you run into the ditch.
BEAR37|If you swerved to the left, you hit an oncoming cars like.
NEUT38|What do you do?
BEAR39|You run over the raccoon?
NEUT40|Yeah, that is.
NEUT41|"Until the second season, that was kind of the foundation for Todd."""
