NEUT4|15% like.
NEUT5|ID company Celsius only four or five, then sales $119,000,000 in Celsius and over $1 billion in fees.
NEUT6|Price to earning 14 price to sales.
BULL7|2 versus 730.
BEAR8|Definitely Celsius is not a good stock to buy.
NEUT9|And imagine what a regular shareholders will do with this gains.
NEUT10|Maybe they will take profit, and by national beverage it can be good idea because the national beverage it is quite the same as they also focused on healthy living and their development.

BULL18|Really nice dividends around 6% per year on Gurufocus so we can see a financial strange 8 profitability rank, 9 positive outlook and I think we can call this talk as a growing stock and some analysts.
