NEUT0|"""Let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see here on Friday that formed the small red car.
NEUT2|Notice small red candle.
BULL3|Has also within the trading range before it distracting Rainhas.
NEUT4|From the several weeks ago, actually it's.
NEUT5|If we draw a line here, we can see.
NEUT6|It has tried between this range.
NEUT7|Also long.
BEAR8|And with decrease the volume, that means actually no.
NEUT9|Selling and not buying from the institution that in my opinion, even though the.
NEUT10|Price range is narrow.
BEAR11|But it's very likely for some institution to accumulate here, because we can see the volume has decreased significantly.
NEUT12|It means there's no selling pressure.
NEUT13|So the price here is reasonable for Apple.
NEUT14|We have an option.
NEUT15|He rolled away and then we got a consolidation.
BULL16|It's a very healthy sign for them.
NEUT17|Apple stock if we change stock into a meter.
NEUT18|It's a weekly chart.
BULL19|Now we can see after this huge advance we have got a consolidation area, so this is still healthy for Apple stock also got very small trading volume.
NEUT20|Here it means there's no selling pressure and very likely somebody's accumulated.
NEUT21|So in my opinion.
BULL22|The long time the middle long term uptrend still kept intact for Apple, so here may be a good time to accumulate it.
BULL23|"Thank you."""
