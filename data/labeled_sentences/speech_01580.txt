NEUT0|"""So you were starting your own company, but what expertise did you have to start your own company in the business world?"
NEUT1|I had no expertise.
NEUT2|And there was really no reason to give me any backing.
BEAR3|Fortunately, my first foray was in Silver in 1993, and the site Geist was that Silver was going to go down to $2.00 because digital film would supplant silver halide.
NEUT4|I believe that people got the analysis wrong, and that Silver had a better chance of going back to 50, so I put my money on silver options and silver went from 3 1/2 to five and a half dollars in relatively short order, and I made enough money to decide that I didn't want to do that anymore, but I would take.
NEUT5|All that money and put that when buying an option on a silver property.
NEUT6|Let me make sure I understand where did you get the money to buy the options.
NEUT7|I started with $10,000 so I had a little bit of savings and turned that into hundreds of thousands of dollars and then put the money on a property in Idaho.
NEUT8|And I realized around that time that I really didn't have very much competition.
NEUT9|An so I took whatever money I had and I went to Peru and Bolivia and Mexico and I would put down options on these properties.
NEUT10|After a certain period of time, I found that I had is interesting.
NEUT11|A portfolio of option properties as any existing silver company, and I knew that even though I wasn't ready for prime time, even though.
BEAR12|The story was a little bit flaky and delusional.
NEUT13|A New York based financial type with no background in engineering or geology.
NEUT14|Starting a mining company.
NEUT15|I kept it low key but I was introduced to George Soros.
NEUT16|And he and his brother Paul invested in me.
NEUT17|And how old were you at this time?
NEUT18|I was.
NEUT19|3233 and you were married then?
BULL20|I was engaged gauged ended.
NEUT21|Your fiance say.
NEUT22|What do you do for a living Ono?
NEUT23|No no, she was instrumental in the entire process.
NEUT24|When I had the vision of buying silver mines.
NEUT25|It was in the middle of the night and she was at NYU.
NEUT26|You she'd left the Israeli Air Force and was studying at NYU you.
NEUT27|Apparently at 3:00 o'clock in the morning I sat up in bed and said, please write this down so I don't forget it by silver mines.
NEUT28|And so the next day definitely said to me.
NEUT29|By the way, last night you told me to write down by Silvermines.
NEUT30|So I'm reminding you.
NEUT31|But I'm also going to add this that is so ****.
NEUT32|And so I went into the silver business, wow.
NEUT33|So she has unerring side.
NEUT34|OK, so how did it workout?
NEUT35|I found that.
NEUT36|It suited my aptitudes to take that money and buy assets.
NEUT37|And hold those assets.
NEUT38|Having a historical bent allowed me to see the market through the prism of history.
NEUT39|And so when you see these cycles and you understand human psychology and fear and greed.
NEUT40|The history gives you a great perspective, and so if you own the assets and you don't go into debt.
NEUT41|"It really becomes a function of time before you become fashionable again, and we made a huge discovery in Bolivia and that's where the fortune originated."""
