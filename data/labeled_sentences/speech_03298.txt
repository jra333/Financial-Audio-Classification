BEAR0|"""We have problems out there in the world today."
NEUT1|No question about it.
NEUT2|So how are we going to make the change?
NEUT3|Philanthropy is all about the heart and what?
NEUT4|What means most to you?
NEUT5|Doing well by doing good is my philosophy.
NEUT6|That means you can create a great venture and if the venture can do good, that becomes a philanthropic venture.
NEUT7|From my perspective, it takes awhile to find out what you're really interested in and what you really want to do.
NEUT8|My family has always been very philanthropic.
NEUT9|We've always been taught to give back.
NEUT10|I grew up with a sensibility that education was far and away the most important thing one could focus on.
NEUT11|I went to Brown University, but my mom said I couldn't be an artist that starve.
NEUT12|So now I try to marry my art and my business by designing properties and stuff.
BEAR13|A lot of the greatest mistakes are always made in the first six months 'cause we want to be impulsive and emotional.
NEUT14|Two things you never want to be in business and philanthropy.
BEAR15|My philanthropy suffered a grave set back when I was.
NEUT16|Accused of.
BEAR17|A crime and my personal fortune was greatly diminished as you change your interest in your desires.
NEUT18|In philanthropy change, I think you have to be open to that change who really want to create a change and this is not about me.
NEUT19|Donna Karan.
NEUT20|This is about the we we used to have a mindset.
NEUT21|You know, once you want to give him the money, your responsibility is done and I think what we've learned is.
NEUT22|It's really kind of starting at that point.
NEUT23|I couldn't imagine dressing people without addressing the issues.
NEUT24|The best thing you can ask them is to give their time instead of asking them to give half their money.
BULL25|If they can make it flash to give 30% of their time, the world would be a better place.
NEUT26|You gotta make the right choice, but then you have to make sure it really is implemented an it produces the results you were hoping and infinite.
NEUT27|What have you learned and what are you going to do different if you're still young and active, I think that you know the money certainly can help any situation, but I think what you want to do is maintain long lasting.
NEUT28|Impact positive impact money is the best way to sort of help in philanthropy.
NEUT29|I mean, you can spend your time.
NEUT30|You can do this.
NEUT31|You can do that, but it all comes down in the in the end to how much money can be invested in A cause to make a difference we need a humility and a real appreciation of the complex adaptive nature of the problems we face.
NEUT32|If we, as philanthropists want to possibly start, you know, changing the underlying factors that are driving the systems we see.
NEUT33|The challenge is to try to make a permanent impact other than providing Band-aids with just a little money.
NEUT34|Here, my Gran father, my bar mitzvah, and there's not all that much that I remember at my bar mitzvah, but I do remember exactly where my grandfathers said.
NEUT35|When you leave, let men be glad you can, and that is his way of saying, make a difference.
NEUT36|You're here for a short period of time, so you want to leave, you know, making the world better than when you showed up in it.
BULL37|We can build businesses global business as we restructure them.
NEUT38|We.
NEUT39|We buy them and then rebuild them, and if you can go provide access to education and health care to billions of people around the world.
NEUT40|And if you happen to make a billion dollar profit, my hats off to you.
BULL41|"That's a great venture and that's what we want people to do is not two separate becoming doing well from doing good because you can do both, and that's how you create scalable sustainable change."""
