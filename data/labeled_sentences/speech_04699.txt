NEUT0|"""Low volatility funds have become a high anxiety trade of late now."
NEUT1|Here's the background for national academics have long known that investors systematically overpay for glamorous but risky moonshots stocks and the undervalue boring mature companies.
BULL2|So by simply buying more than latter, investors can overtime generate above market returns, and crucially, with less turbulence.
BULL3|And that realization has given birth to a clutch of low volatility ETF's, which have proven phenomenally popular in recent years.
BULL4|But after a strong run, their promise has started to unravel this autumn.
BEAR5|The S&P 500 Low Volatility Index has fallen 5.2% since beginning of July compared to the broader markets 2.2% gain.
BULL6|Nor have these ETF's proven as tranquil as their name implies.
NEUT7|And here's a chart showing the 30 day volatility or the supposedly lovall index and against the broader market.
BEAR8|And as you can see, the low volatility gauge is actually been choppier than the S&P 500 since around mid August.
BEAR9|Basically, these strategies just proved too popular.
NEUT10|Yields start fixing.
NEUT11|Can refugees have in recent years piled into steady dividend paying industries such as utilities and real estate, and these make up a big chunk of low Vol ETF Holdings.
BEAR12|But valuations just became so stretched, and when the momentum reversed this autumn low Vol ETF's took a beating.
BEAR13|And this set back is naturally dented their reputation.
NEUT14|Blackrock's USMV, the Lovel Industries biggest vehicle celebrate its 5th birthday this week.
BULL15|It's taken in the third biggest inflows of any U.S. equity ETF this year.
BEAR16|But its outstanding, shares a good gauge for its popularity have declined since the summer and slipped heavily in October as investors yanked money out.
NEUT17|Now this shakeout will probably continue for a little bit longer according to the latest Bank of America survey.
NEUT18|Investors think this strategy is the third most crowded trade in markets after high quality stocks and investment grade bonds.
BEAR19|But readings for both of those markets actually fell last month.
BULL20|Also, the Lovoll made its very first appearance on the crowded list.
BULL21|Low Vol ETF's will probably stay to come back once the shakeout is complete, as the academic evidence underpinning the strategy does remain strong.
BEAR22|But the woeful recent performance is an excellent example of how crowding can sabotage even the smartest trades was a markets.
NEUT23|"There simply aren't really magic money trees."""
