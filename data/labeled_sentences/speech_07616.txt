NEUT0|"""You know one of the things you talked about in the annual letter was."
NEUT1|Stock buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway, and for the first time, you told people to call Mark Millard in your office outright if they have $20 million worth of Berkshire shares, and they're ready to sell, right?
NEUT2|That's a really unusual move.
NEUT3|Why did you do that?
NEUT4|Well, we did it because it's very hard to buy blocks in the market of Berkshire.
NEUT5|We probably never see blocks, except we do see him from.
NEUT6|A states or occasionally, but if somebody is going to sell 100,000,000 shares at $100 million worth of Berkshire, and we want to buy it, we would like him to call us.
NEUT7|And if it's if it's, if we're buying at that price level, will be buying, buy it.
NEUT8|Dan Mahoney actually wrote in with a very similar question he just said, is it hard to buy back the shares?
NEUT9|That's hardly.
NEUT10|It's harder to buy back Berkshire shares and say Bank of America is buying back their shared Bank of America bought back 8 or 9% of their stock last year an they can really do it without.
NEUT11|Moving the market.
NEUT12|I mean Apple's been buying back a ton of stock.
NEUT13|They were buying stock at the same time we were buying stock, but it was easier for us to buy Apple stock even though Apple itself was buying a lot of stock than it is to buy Berkshire Berkshire's.
NEUT14|Well, it's held by people that really plan to keep it there.
NEUT15|I think the amount of speculation in Berkshire stock is relatively low compared to most stock sense, and so it's it's it's.
NEUT16|Well, we bought $5 billion worth last year, but that's only 1% of the market cap and an I would say with a great many companies you can buy for 5% of the company fairly easily a year without disturbing the market.
NEUT17|"American Express has been buying it every year."""
