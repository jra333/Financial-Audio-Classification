NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, health care analyst David Williamson, here with the always popular, ask a full segment and today's question comes from Debbie."
NEUT1|She's wondering should I buy, sell, or hold Teva Pharmaceuticals now?
NEUT2|Debbie, I don't want to Bury the lead.
NEUT3|No, you should not buy Teva now.
NEUT4|There are a number of reasons why one is patent Cliff troubles.
NEUT5|Now it's a bit ironic that the biggest growth driver drug patent expirations for a generic drug company like Teva is also its biggest short term problem, but Teva is no ordinary generic drug maker gets a fifth of its revenue, and even more of its bottom line from a brand in multiple sclerosis drug called Capax own, and the Clock is ticking on its blockbuster.
BEAR6|Its patent runs out in 2015.
BULL7|In the meantime, it's also facing new competition.
NEUT8|Biogen's TECFIDERA is an oral multiple sclerosis drug.
NEUT9|Capax own is injected.
BULL10|Antec Federal has strong efficacy and safety data.
BULL11|To go along with it, it's launch is actually going so well.
BEAR12|Biogen is having trouble having trouble keeping up with demand now.
NEUT13|TiVo was rightly concerned about it.
NEUT14|Even filed a citizen's petition with the FDA to try to delay tech federal approval.
NEUT15|So you know, Capax own has these two problems.
BEAR16|Its sales will evaporate once a generic threat comes in.
BEAR17|We traditionally see sales plummet 90%, but even before then it will come under pressure from competition.
BEAR18|Now there's also a significant tax overhang.
BEAR19|With this company as well, the Israeli government thinks Teva isn't paying its fair share and is taking a closer look at its 12% tax rate.
BEAR20|There are negotiations between the company and the government on going, but it's not like Teva's tax rate is going to get even lower, so any changes to the status quo will be incrementally negative.
NEUT21|And keep in mind roughly 20% of its earnings in 2020.
BEAR22|Eleven came from Israeli tax breaks, so we could see concerns over a significant negative impact.
NEUT23|Really weigh on shares until this is resolved.
NEUT24|You know, Warren Buffett talks about being greedy when others are fearful, but that doesn't mean just jumping into any old beaten down stock.
NEUT25|Teva needs to show me and start executing a plan to reinvigorate growth before I can get excited about it.
BEAR26|I know there's a lot of discussion using generic drugs to attempt to make new therapeutic entities, but we've seen some problems with this before, including generic threats for those entities and also pricing pushback from payers.
NEUT27|Now I'm going to say, hold.
BEAR28|Between buy, sell and hold, because the stock has been beaten down so much and you know, I think it is probably trying trading slightly lower than fair value, but I'm much closer to sell them to buy on that end of the spectrum.
NEUT29|I wouldn't say you know.
NEUT30|Go out and short the stock, but if you have better investment ideas out there, moving money out of Teva may make sense to fund those.
NEUT31|And if you're looking at generic drug companies, there may be better buys as well.
NEUT32|Something like activists, which is gone.
NEUT33|A huge run, but the Warner Chilcott deal is a huge win and you may want to wait for a pullback before jumping.
NEUT34|In there, so Debbie hopefully I answered your question on Teva.
NEUT35|I think it's a hole that is much closer to a cell into a bye.
NEUT36|Thanks for watching and stay tuned for more.
NEUT37|"Ask a full full on."""
