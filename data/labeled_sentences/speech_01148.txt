NEUT0|"""No, I don't think it's necessarily the warning."
NEUT1|I mean, I think Julie is right.
NEUT2|I think it's important important for them to point that out.
NEUT3|Obviously have others that have been talking about it.
BULL4|I think that the reason that the stock is off a bit it's had a big run into the print and you know if you look at guidance was for revenues, was about 4% better overall?
BULL5|Looks like revenues overall, or about 6% better.
BULL6|Dear user only user growth was relatively in line so I just don't think it was sort of that Monster beat that everyone was expecting, however.
NEUT7|I would point out that the the most important geography, North America was very strong.
BULL8|That was up 11% or better consensus by 11% of revenues in ARPU, roughly by 10%.
NEUT9|So that's what we really focus on.
BULL10|But as I mentioned, the overall revenues were maybe not quite as strong.
BULL11|Europe was not quite as strong as North America, but still nice.
NEUT12|Nice beat there in terms of Apple, I think it's prudent for them to point that out.
NEUT13|I know that.
NEUT14|You know to their point, we haven't really seen the impacts right yet because it hasn't been enforced, it will be enforced by the end of March.
NEUT15|So we're going to need to see just how much consent platforms are getting from their users and and that's really going to tell us, you know how it's going to affect, you, know, add returns what we saw a month to beat Mark from from Google on the advertising side, the snap immediately benefit from the same themes, or only if they keep innovating in a sort of.
BULL16|A permanent chase with their biggest rivals Facebook.
NEUT17|Yeah, great question.
NEUT18|Well I I would say snap sort of sits on its own island, just given the fact that they predominantly focus on Gen Z.
NEUT19|So they do, you know, obviously you know benefit by the same macro events that are sort of driving advertising and certainly Commerce.
NEUT20|Certainly is driving a lot more advertising to their platform as well as others and social, but I think for Snapchat what I have been focusing on is really the brands across social.
NEUT21|We tend to focus on direct response and performance.
NEUT22|Advertisers you know, for instance, that Facebook that's 80% of their revenues by our estimates at Snapchat, that's only about half.
BULL23|So half of the revenues coming from brands, and we saw a big uptick last quarter after a hiatus.
NEUT24|Really, from brands and Snapchats really catering.
NEUT25|Very well the brands and like I said, they're the only ones that really have that sort of captive ninety million user base in the US to target.
NEUT26|Mark Scott ovic.
