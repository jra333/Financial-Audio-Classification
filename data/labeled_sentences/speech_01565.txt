BEAR0|"""Today we're talking about the Warren Buffett curse in investing that has destroyed careers, killed returns and frustrated investors."
BEAR1|It's a curse that haunts new investors on the rise and throws them down back to the ground.
NEUT2|I have a list of investors who were posting impressive returns year on year that everyone thought they will be the next Warren Buffett.
NEUT3|What happens next can only be described as their worst nightmare.
NEUT4|Be sure to hit that like button to help me out with the YouTube algorithm and let's jump right into it first on the list we have.
NEUT5|Eddie Lampert, after quitting his job at Goldman Sachs.
NEUT6|He started his hedge fund at 25 years old.
BULL7|He began getting an average annual return of 29% for his clients, which included the likes of Michael Dell and David Geffen.
NEUT8|According to his clients, his secret to getting such stellar returns was investing in stuff that's not ****.
NEUT9|No one can go unnoticed with returns like these and the comparison to the greats of the investing world was inevitable.
NEUT10|The next Warren Buffett was written.
NEUT11|On Bloomberg Business Week headline in 2002, right around the time when Lampert took up a majority stake in Kmart for a little less than $1 billion.
NEUT12|Once Kmart merged with Sears later that year at an $8.6 billion valuation, the Lamb Parton buffet comparison seemed like the only news on CNBC.
NEUT13|The merged entity was flying high for years until things went dire.
NEUT14|When the 2007 downturn came.
BEAR15|Ever since then, Sears has been closing stores cutting costs.
BEAR16|And selling department's by 2016, Sears had lost more than $10 billion.
NEUT17|Second on the list we have J Michael Pearson, who was the CEO of Valeant Pharmaceuticals.
NEUT18|I've already talked about Valiant in relation to Bill Ackman and a previous video, which you can check out here.
NEUT19|It was actually built Ackman himself, who compared Pearson to Warren Buffett.
NEUT20|The comparison seemed justified, just like Berkshire Valliant was snatching off competitors left and right.
NEUT21|First emerged with Biovail in 2010.
NEUT22|Snapped up Medicis in 2012, then bought Bausch and Lomb in 2013 and Salix in 2015.
BULL23|This proved to be a quite lucrative strategy and a revolutionary one in the Pharmaceutical industry.
NEUT24|The Valiant stock grew more than 4500% in just eight years, and a person's leadership, but it was all a hoax.
NEUT25|Pearson didn't have a revolutionary business that he employed.
NEUT26|After acquiring these companies.
NEUT27|Instead, he just hiked the life saving drug prices to profit off the sick and dying people.
NEUT28|Who didn't have any alternatives to these drugs?
BULL29|Valeant raised the price on every single drug that it acquired.
BULL30|Sometimes all the way up to 525% within a span of months.
NEUT31|Once all this came out, the stock went crashing down, and with it Pearson's career Next up we have Bill Ackman himself.
NEUT32|He did put the curse on Pearson.
NEUT33|Maybe not really, I don't know.
NEUT34|But Valiant was a fraud bill.
NEUT35|Ackman himself drew a Warren Buffett comparison.
BEAR36|When his fund made over $1 billion in 2015, well since then, his fund stock lost over 2/3 of its value in the following two years.
BULL37|But he made waves again with his greatest trade ever earlier this year.
NEUT38|So maybe he will be the one to break the curse and make a comeback.
BEAR39|I sure hope so, because without Ackman this channel will most likely be added to the Warren Buffett curse list.
NEUT40|So I present the question to you guys.
NEUT41|What do you think about the Warren Buffett curse?
BEAR42|Is it unnecessary pressure on rising managers?
