NEUT0|"""Bumble makes its debut today after pricing its IPO at 43."
BULL1|That's above the already Ray raised range of 37 to 39.
BULL2|The dating service, raising more than two billion overall value of more than 7 billion.
NEUT3|We will talk to Founder and CEO Whitney Wolf Herd later this morning.
NEUT4|On Squawk Alley, the $7 billion number David doesn't really account for the option for the overallotment.
NEUT5|Yeah, it's going to be an incredibly as we say, hot IPO.
NEUT6|We're going to want to keep an eye on the open because it could be significant percentage gains that we see.
NEUT7|Raising more around 2 billion, you know the oversubscribed numbers?
NEUT8|As you might imagine, or enormous everybody fighting for their allocation.
NEUT9|But the business model Jim is what's interesting to people and here a few things shared by frankly people, of course, who are lining up to own this thing this morning so their bullish lower churn they cite then match because people, you know, there's not as much meanness, frankly, on the site, there's more empathy and kindness, which is what Meredith excuse me Whitney Wolf Herd was going going for.
NEUT10|The ladies are in charge.
NEUT11|It's by the way female run fully female run, organization, board, all those things and then her letter when you read it is interesting.
NEUT12|You know she wanted a way for women to make the first move without judgment or fear and a technology platform that would encourage good behavior.
NEUT13|Treat all genders equal and create better relationships and that is what led her to start the company.
BEAR14|A lot of people doing virtual dates these days, by the way again, which leads to lower turn.
NEUT15|It just takes a lot longer to sort of move along in the relationship you order Uber eats for your virtual date, apparently.
NEUT16|And again, I don't.
NEUT17|You know I'm learning this, you have drizzly with that.
NEUT18|Or is it too?
NEUT19|I guess so.
NEUT20|But that slow dating sort of helps.
NEUT21|Will they move into virtual goods?
NEUT22|Will they move from creating this community?
NEUT23|They have two other services that, at least is a question.
NEUT24|And certainly something that those who are positive on the stock.
NEUT25|Jim seemed to believe as a possibility and its global.
NEUT26|So you got all that this morning lining up for what seems to be a very very successful note about Kindler.
NEUT27|Gentler.
NEUT28|It makes me think about the most kind and gentle website.
NEUT29|Which is Pinterest where Pinterest by declaring himself basically wholesome, seems to have attracted interest from another company?
NEUT30|That is, it should be wholesome.
NEUT31|Yeah, that's an FT story that says Microsoft had taken a look.
NEUT32|I have no idea if that's true.
NEUT33|What were your thoughts about the possibilities?
NEUT34|We, again Bumble is going to be and there's the competitors.
NEUT35|There are plenty of them, yes, but people love the idea that they do have a lot lower churn and there an Whitney Wolf herd is like well thought of amongst at least had some hand I've been talking about, yeah.
BEAR36|Competition I'm sorry.
NEUT37|Yeah yeah, I do think that it is.
NEUT38|It's a.
NEUT39|It's a love company and you're absolutely it's going to be hot.
BULL40|Deal with talking about it all day and I think it's very successful business model.
NEUT41|But I do like this whole idea.
BULL42|Twitter got kinder and gentler and Twitter stock went up.
NEUT43|There is a reaction David to what I regard is verbal violence, right?
NEUT44|It's coming down and I think that people are really trying to figure out whether they should be noted that in my Twitter feed, yet have you seen it in yours?
NEUT45|Ray from yesterday, did you?
NEUT46|Well, I just posted my stuff about Moderna equal to certain point.
BEAR47|You know there's people who trash you for having your birthday.
NEUT48|I know wow or anything else Cambridge birthday.
