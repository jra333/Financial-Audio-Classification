NEUT3|Alright, so into the video?
BEAR4|Looking at a QB on the week, you're down 4% on the week, but we did have a nice Friday when we were up about 3%.
NEUT5|So just a quick overview of what the company does.
NEUT6|Aqua Bounty Technologies is a company that works in the field of land based aquaculture.
BULL7|And their technology works towards improving productivity and sustainability.
NEUT8|So the company has a program called the Aqua Advantage Fish program, which the company focuses on raising disease and antibiotic free salmon in their land based farms.
BULL9|The company's business plan also has a reduced carbon footprint impact and also no risk of pollution to marine ecosystems compared to the traditional see cage farming.
NEUT10|So as far as news we found out on Thursday about a share offering which would raise $110.5 million and they be selling 13 million shares at an average price of $8.50.
NEUT11|The company has said that they expect the share offering to close Monday.
NEUT12|Based on the price action that we've seen, I've a feeling the offering may have already been filled by Friday, so the companies plan for the money that they raise.
NEUT13|Does he use it towards building more farms?
NEUT14|Investing in the company's marketing?
NEUT15|So I think this dip that we've gotten do.
BULL16|The share offering has been a great buying opportunity because I think this company is some good long term potential, so I like to buy companies right after they do this share offerings.
BULL17|One thing that I really like about this company is their ability to raise salmon twice as quickly as the conventional way, and I think this is great because it's going to be a focal point of the company's growth.
NEUT18|So my overall thoughts about the company are is that it's kind of overlooked and it's definitely something you should put on your watch list.
NEUT19|If you haven't gotten into it already, because I feel like it's a great long term stock and we could see $20 within a few months.
NEUT20|But what do you guys think about the company?
