NEUT0|"""Well, I think the key is going to be that the Fed does anticipate keeping on their path in terms of the dot plot."
NEUT1|Our outlook is that we will get three Fed rate increases next year as the inflation numbers continue to rise and finally the interesting point that you were talking about just a few minutes ago when companies do get a corporate tax cut, they do get the profits.
NEUT2|And that's actually what you said earlier.
BULL3|Joe in economic terms, is the cost of capital is lowered because now they have cash.
NEUT4|But then we also discussed how they're going to use the cash, and that's really the key.
NEUT5|I think when Janet Yellen was talking about are we going to make a difference in terms of longer and economic growth?
BULL6|Is this cash going to be used to bike equipment an improved productivity?
NEUT7|So I think that was kind of interesting to hear you discussed this earlier and apply it to Janet Yellen's comments.
BULL8|You agree with that, so I think that the Fed is going to be able to continue to raise interest rates in the early part of 2018.
NEUT9|What we have right now is a synchronized global expansion.
BULL10|Most countries around the world are growing above trend.
NEUT11|You have easy monetary policy around the world, so it's a nice backdrop for risk assets.
NEUT12|Federal Reserve is going to be able to continue to normalize policy in that environment, but I would watch the 10 year.
BEAR13|I mean what you saw yesterday was equity markets up, bond markets rallying, so we still are flattening the yield curve some if we don't get a significant pickup in inflation.
NEUT14|Federal Reserve will have to back off in 2018.
NEUT15|So John, I you know a lot of people now are saying.
NEUT16|Stimulus now what?
NEUT17|What are you thinking?
NEUT18|I guess there.
NEUT19|The proxy they use for how strong economy is is probably the 4% unemployment rate.
BEAR20|Yet you know we still got these very low bond yields around the world and you've got the notion.
NEUT21|I think that a lot of these jobs that were created in the last maybe 10 years, maybe people, some of them.
NEUT22|Maybe your part time, other ones, maybe people would like better jobs, other the other notion is that maybe if you had a choice of two or three jobs, you might be able to hold out for more money.
NEUT23|Is it ever if you've had?
BULL24|Eight years of 2% growth.
NEUT25|Is it a bad thing to try and to try and stimulate the economy where we are right now?
NEUT26|Or is there's never a bad time to try and make the economy better?
NEUT27|Is there to make it better to make it more efficient?
NEUT28|Know never a bad time and I'll go back to Janet.
NEUT29|Yellen's comments.
BULL30|I think you do get a short run stimulus here, but we have only two point, 7% growth for 2018 in the US economy and that's not a big push in the economy overall.
NEUT31|And then longer term, let's go back to the same issue.
BULL32|Unless you're improving productivity.
NEUT33|And labor force participation rate.
NEUT34|There really isn't a sustained stimulus going forward.
