BULL0|"""In this video, I'm going to talk about a stock that I think is going to have a good run up in the coming weeks."
NEUT1|It's already seen a run up, but then it's kind of come down and consolidated a little bit, so I'm going to give my price target on this.
BULL2|I'm going to give a good entry point.
NEUT3|We're going to talk a little bit about the technology that this company does.
NEUT4|So own body anomaly here.

NEUT7|We talk about stocks crypto and all kinds of things related to the financial world.
NEUT8|And in this video, we're going to talk about Ocean power, technology, ticker, symbol, opty.
NEUT9|The technology that this company is putting out right now is very very interesting to me.
NEUT10|It can be used for a lot of applications to PB3.
NEUT11|Power Buoy can act as an uninterruptible power supply which constantly recharges itself by harvesting energy from the waves.
NEUT12|So very very interesting technology and it kind of just plays in with what's going on right now.
NEUT13|By then wants to do clean energy and this is just a hot sector right now so.
NEUT14|Obviously it is this.
BULL15|Everything is hot on the market right now so but I think this is going to have a really good run up so I am going to give my price targets on this and have good entry.
NEUT16|So let's just dive right into the chart.
BEAR17|It is a possibility that we get more of a short term pullback because they just recently did a merger with the Company 3 Dent Technologies.
BEAR18|So it's possible that we do see a kind of a rundown over here and it.
NEUT19|We kind of like maybe trade a little bit sideways consolidate, which would would.
NEUT20|I wouldn't mind seeing that because these areas right here of where we got rejected.
BULL21|So these resistance areas could definitely act as support.
NEUT22|Moving forward, so maybe the up like the upper the side.
NEUT23|The lower force could act as support moving head, but I would definitely be.
NEUT24|More comfortable getting into this between like $3.80 and.
NEUT25|$4.00 an.
NEUT26|You know 15 cents, $0.10.
NEUT27|So lower force, high threes with this if you can get in there, I think you're going to.
NEUT28|I think you're going to do good, but again, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT29|This is not financial advice, so it's just my opinion.
NEUT30|This is just for entertainment purposes only.
BULL31|I think if you can get in in the low force in this, I think you're going to do good.
NEUT32|I have a price target on this $8.00 so I think we're going to see $8.00 in the coming months on this.
NEUT33|So this is something that definitely have your eye on wicked interesting technology.
NEUT34|Like I didn't dive into the financials on this, I didn't really dive into anything like that.
NEUT35|I'm probably going to play this as a short term play.
NEUT36|I know it's probably a long term hold.
NEUT37|This company could be $30 a share someday, maybe more but.
NEUT38|For me it's a short term hold.
NEUT39|There's so so many stocks to invest in right now.
NEUT40|There's so many hot sectors, there's so many hot stocks right now, so.
BULL41|Like I said, if you can get into this in the Low force upper threes, I think you're going to do good.
BULL42|"I hope you guys enjoyed the video and I will see you in the next one."""
