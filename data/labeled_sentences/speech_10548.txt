NEUT0|"""Meanwhile, Jim, he did talk about stock sales."
NEUT1|I know you were commenting on that on Twitter this morning that NB 5 ones he says not amendable because of company policy, not anything externally.
NEUT2|Cut deep.
NEUT3|OK, well there's also this thing called in government, but maybe thinks that there's some sort of Commerce Clause.
NEUT4|Look, the government doesn't want you to trade, so when you get to the period when you announce their bids, the same information you cancel your plan plans can be cancelled.
NEUT5|The government doesn't want you to be out there doing anything with your stock when your situation.
NEUT6|Like modernism and you should not be able to get comfort from your counsel.
NEUT7|Now the Council can say whatever they want, but there is a view that the SEC has which is that please don't trade during these periods when you have something, some information and please cancel your plan, you get no comfort if you continue to sell.
NEUT8|If you stop, you get comfort and it's about comfort.
NEUT9|And I don't know how they feel comfort a bowl given the fact that every time I pick up the paper it's more about them selling and it is about what's going on.
NEUT10|Moderna.
NEUT11|I also don't like the idea that you can put it on.
NEUT12|Any time frame 1 October optimistic and don't talk about October.
NEUT13|Just say listen, we hope to have something by the first quarter.
NEUT14|Don't set us up because if you have that then people are going to stay in the house and in the Senate.
NEUT15|But we don't need.
NEUT16|Just do another program if we're going to get a vaccine by October.
NEUT17|Let's just let the dice roll.
NEUT18|Let's have the masks and social distancing play it out, and I think that that's not a good.
BEAR19|That's not an optimum situation.
BEAR20|So a moderna has been setting the pace of over optimism and overselling.
NEUT21|And when I I liked Moderna 20.
NEUT22|But I think that it's time to start saying nothing and saying nothing.
NEUT23|There's nothing wrong with that.
NEUT24|Just saying.
NEUT25|Let's see what happens.
NEUT26|But the people who set us up for the people who were going to most dislike come the fall.
NEUT27|David, you know you shouldn't be setting people up like this.
NEUT28|No, you've made the point that you think this company is a.
NEUT29|If I could say the words a bit more promotional Jim and you would like to see and.
NEUT30|But to be fair, I mean we have also seen Pfizer, a company that I would not lump in his promotional at all.
NEUT31|Feel like they are obligated to release patient studies that involve what 48 people for their vaccines.
NEUT32|So I mean there is such a need to know here that you are.
NEUT33|We do expect all the companies at this point to tell us anything along the way in terms of their progress towards a vaccine.
NEUT34|How about J&J?
NEUT35|Why not use the J&J Alex Cora?
NEUT36|The standard, which says hopes to have results in the first quarter even though he's enrolling 30,000 this week, 30,000, including people who are over 65.
NEUT37|So why don't we just take it from the company that I think is the gold standard now they'll be people out the audience.
BULL38|A gold standard for talc, but I do think in terms of disclosure J&J is getting some very good advice and people should.
NEUT39|Big companies should take this view.
NEUT40|Nova Vax for all their earlier promotion.
BULL41|I think it's been quiet enough to make me feel better about them.
NEUT42|I just don't want false hopes.
NEUT43|As Ken Frazier would say, there's nothing worse than false hope, Scott Ken reports on Friday where we have Caterpillar, Exxon, Chevron, and Ken that's going to be 1.
BULL44|"There's so many pivotal days this week, Carl, that I think by the end of the week, our heads are going to be spending not unlike Reagan."""
