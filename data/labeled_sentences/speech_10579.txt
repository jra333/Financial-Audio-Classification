BEAR0|"""If you were watching CNBC 10 years ago today, you might remember that somewhere in the middle of the session, the market started to act really weird."
NEUT1|Watch this.
NEUT2|What we're seeing right now?
NEUT3|I mean, maybe I believe maybe unprecedented Kenobi.
NEUT4|There that is not a real thing.
BEAR5|Socket Stupid system obviously broke down.
BEAR6|We find out that there was a glitch in the list from PNG which indicate when it rains failed and it obviously broke down.
BEAR7|It just broke out Winston about the markets didn't work, it broke down.
BEAR8|The machines broke down.
NEUT9|That's what happens.
NEUT10|Yeah, I missed you yesterday, was that yeah, but your point was that it was a big shake.
BULL11|It shook confidence in ways that lasted a lot longer than we might have thought.
NEUT12|Well, Aikido Proctor that day my friend Erin Burnett used, I always use proctors.
NEUT13|Kind of Bristol Myers.
NEUT14|And when I came out, Proctor was at 90 and I said it didn't really represent great value.
NEUT15|And then 10 minutes later was at 40.
BULL16|And I said Gino Proctor looks really good here.
NEUT17|You can't do that.
NEUT18|You can't have.
NEUT19|You can't have stocks completely divorced themselves in the fundamentals.
NEUT20|It also happened, by the way, remember when there was ill timed.
NEUT21|Comment by a guy who's really fabulous.
BEAR22|James Bullard wanted Friday on a Sirius radio show and we came in on Monday and all the stocks were down.
BEAR23|People thought they might have to tighten because of what he said and you had another phony market.
NEUT24|The phony market.
NEUT25|Every time this happens people say this mark this thing this asset class is not worthy of my of my hard earned money an I I'm always hard pressed to disagree because the the they cleaned up their act.
NEUT26|I mean Bob is an idiot.
NEUT27|Great piece the other day about how yes things didn't breakdown this time and I think that's great, but when you have your money in a one of the greatest blue chips of all time, Procter and it gets cut in half in 12 minutes.
NEUT28|Is that really you want your IR A or your 41K cut in half in 12 minutes?
NEUT29|It's just it doesn't hold up under close scrutiny so it's always a problem we've got.
NEUT30|Now we're starting to protect, but the there was just a flash crash.
NEUT31|Had a lot to do with machines over running people.
NEUT32|Which exactly what happened 87 and remember a lot of these are about greed.
NEUT33|We have a lot of machines in their exchanges.
NEUT34|Make a lot of money.
NEUT35|There's no people anymore.
NEUT36|You know what the deal is.
NEUT37|I mean this.
NEUT38|This industry used to be about the buying a piece of America and now I don't know what it is about.
NEUT39|"I am piece of what?"""
