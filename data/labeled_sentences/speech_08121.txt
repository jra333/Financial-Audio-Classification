BEAR0|"""Yeah Melissa, the good news is they expect this recession to end sometime this year."
BEAR1|The bad news is a lot of them are looking for maybe a second or a knock on or a double dip recession to follow the National Association for Business Economics out with their policy survey.
NEUT2|What they find is I'll make this chart easy for you.
NEUT3|48% those are the two middle bars there.
BEAR4|They see a 25 to 33% chance of a double dip.
NEUT5|The two bars on the right 31% see the chance of a double dip is 50% or higher, just the 15%.
NEUT6|That's here.
NEUT7|Bar on the left, see the chances 10% or less.
NEUT8|Looking at the other outlook for policy, what you see is that the the this recession ending and sometime in the second half of this year the economy will recover but won't recover.
NEUT9|The 2019 Q 4 level until the middle of two, which is a pretty long way off.
BEAR10|Finally 40% of business closures.
NEUT11|They expect to be permanent, but they're looking for a fiscal package of 1 1/2 trillion or higher.
NEUT12|Melissa.
NEUT13|I think the reasons why.
BEAR14|He is concerned about the double dip is a second wave of the virus.
BEAR15|Maybe a policy mistake in terms of not providing.
NEUT16|Oh and there's are tracking.
NEUT17|I'm sorry I forgot to get to that.
NEUT18|25.6 is the estimate for the third quarter.
BULL19|That's up five points, so we are deep strengthening in this current quarter.
NEUT20|Maybe the stocks reflecting that.
NEUT21|But getting back Melissa to the reasons for the double dip.
NEUT22|Maybe a second wave of the virus?
BEAR23|A policy mistake in terms of not providing additional stimulus, but also maybe a second wave of economic pain which could come potentially from the scoring and the businesses that we've been talking about.
NEUT24|"Are not going to reopen as even once the economy reopens."""
