NEUT0|"""Like boss here folks, staring me, talking about stock market margin debt, the New York Stock Exchange recently updated its stock market debt data, and it's showing that Mark Main Street and Wall Street are continuing to dump billions of dollars and borrowed money into the stock market."
BULL1|As you can see from this chart here, borrowed money in the stock market known as margin debt, hit an all time high of $423.7 billion in November.
BEAR2|After we adjust this data for inflation, though, this puts margin debt around 4.6% below levels seen during the housing bubble.
BEAR3|In abovehighsetduringthe.com bubble.
BULL4|So as you can see, margin debt balances are very high.
NEUT5|What is margin debt?
NEUT6|Though folks, well, margined is when someone takes out a loan borrowed money.
NEUT7|They take, they borrow money from a bank and they invest that money into the stock market.
BULL8|Right now this can be really advantageous for speculators because interest rates are so low.
NEUT9|For example, if rates are at 8% a year, an individual would need to make greater than 8% return on that borrowed money in the first year to make money.
NEUT10|Rates are currently around 1.25 to 4%.
NEUT11|And the margin debt market.
BULL12|So to make money using leverage today it's much easier than it has been in previous higher interest rate environment.
BULL13|So I personally believe margin debt probably has a ways to go in the market will probably see it tick higher due to it being stimulated by those low interest rates are seeing the market here in industrials the sector I cover for The Motley Fool, we've seen shares of Tesla Motors really benefit from this recent ball market and likely margin debt shares are up around 327% year to date compared to a 23% increase in the Dow Jones.
BEAR14|Industrial index remember Tesla Rose as model SL skyrocketed, proving the shorts wrong that we're betting against the stock causing incredible short squeeze and cells causing their shares skyrocket.
BULL15|The market is now predicting a successful launch of the Model X and Gen 3 mass market EV.
NEUT16|So investors are really want to keep an eye on those tied to key developments at Tesla Motors to take away.
NEUT17|Though folks debt shouldn't be used to time the market.
NEUT18|If you see data like this shouldn't be used to scare you to selling in your entire portfolio, but rather just something to sober up your investing psych.
BULL19|When I see the market rally in debt levels raise upwards.
NEUT20|I personally start making my wish list of stocks to buy on the market correction or sell off and making sure my investing thesis for each of my Holdings is still intact.
NEUT21|If not, it might be the time to sell some of those Holdings.
NEUT22|If the investing thesis has played out.
NEUT23|For example, I recently sold my shares in Omega Protein Corp because it was a value play in the shares had rally in the value play had come to fruition.
NEUT24|Thankfully, that's all I have on margin debt today folks.
