NEUT0|"""However, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see here.
NEUT2|Apple had go study.
NEUT3|Within this.
NEUT4|And it's obviously has been steady, and if the Apple stock can become study the whole US share market will go study and if we change the chart into weekly chart we can see it clearly.
NEUT5|Here we can see this is a.
NEUT6|Cup handle.
NEUT7|Back test and then.
NEUT8|Here.
NEUT9|It back again.
BULL10|So in my opinion, Apple still has the potential to retest the former high even breakthrough in the mid term.
NEUT11|So if we check the whole market we can see.
BULL12|Recently the US share market has go study even higher because the market or rest priced in the wind of Biden and everybody hope.
NEUT13|The.
NEUT14|Democracy will make a cooperative with the federal.
BULL15|Policy to make the liquidity enough to push the market higher.
BULL16|The reality is that liquidity's do enough to push the market.
NEUT17|So in my opinion here.
BULL18|When the Apple stock has been steady and try to retest the high so it should be a. Gamepoint should buy here so so that we can win in midterm.
BULL19|"Thank you."""
