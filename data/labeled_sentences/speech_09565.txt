NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, my name is diva Cora Bobby in my final class project I have developed a stock prediction app."
NEUT1|My goal in this project was to create an application that can showcase and highlight the enormous power.
NEUT2|An endless possibilities of neural network.
NEUT3|I choose to work with the stock market because it's challenging and something really hard to do in the first part of the project I explored and search for different features and predictors, then drag the stock price, then look for different ways to collect data.
NEUT4|Data is really hard to come by, controlled by big.
NEUT5|Players in the market.
NEUT6|Then I trained and tested my model with different features, since when I finally found a model in the second part, I developed a web application that can make real time predictions using that model.
NEUT7|I spent a lot of time searching for the right features besides price and volume.
NEUT8|There are thousands of indicators.
NEUT9|I experimented with RSI, person change log returns, market influence and sector sympathy.
NEUT10|In my model I used a listing network to build my model and training.
NEUT11|With 60 years of historical Coca Cola stock data after finalizing the model, I put it to work by developing an web application using Node, JS Express and Mongo DB.
NEUT12|At the app can fits real time stock data from different structures, websites and make our predictions.
NEUT13|And this is the EY.
NEUT14|This is what you see when you open the app on a browser.
NEUT15|You can select the stock and a time interval of your choice and ask for predictions.
NEUT16|This is the real predictions of Tesla on 12 seven before market open.
BULL17|The prediction indicates a strong upward momentum for Tesla and this is Tesla.
BULL18|Few hours later the price did go up a lot.
BULL19|The model did learn.
NEUT20|A thing or two about the market.
NEUT21|If you find this interesting, please watch my extended video.
BULL22|"Many thanks to Professor Zoran Rowlan Blogware and thank you all."""
