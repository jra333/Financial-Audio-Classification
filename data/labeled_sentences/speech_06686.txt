NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for October 27th, 2017."
NEUT1|I'm referred by John currencyanalystxm.com and today were going to looking at the euro versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|The euro hit it three months low one point 1615.
BEAR3|Earlier today it has now formed a head and shoulders and broken below the neckline, which was run one point 16116 sixty two one point 1670.
BEAR4|Region the short term bias is bearish as RSI is below the 50 neutral level, but if we look at the four hourly chart we can see RSI has fallen further, it's below 30, at oversold levels, suggesting there could possibly be an upside reversal in the very near term, but in the medium term picture we can see the Mac D. Has fallen further below 0 Ann is below its red signal line that suggests a bearish outlook in the medium term.
NEUT5|The next major support should come around one point 1540 which is 161.8% Fibonacci retracement of the outlook from one point 1669 to one point 1879 and then further down.
NEUT6|We have the one point 1330 area followed the one point 10 level.
NEUT7|Has the next possible major support levels.
NEUT8|If we do see an upside reversal though, as resistance should first come around, one point, 1661 point 1670 region followed by at one point 1750 level data 61.8% Fibo Nachi level and then after that the next major resistance is 1.18 handle which is 38.2% Fibonacci and then we have the October peak of one point 1879 as another as the next.
BEAR9|Possible resistance level break above one point 1879 could possibly signal a shift back to a bullish structure in the medium term, but in the long term we can see we still do have that bullish outlook given that 200 day moving average is still rising and then moving average is still comfortably above the 200 day one, that's it for me.
BULL10|"Thank you so much for watching and have a great day."""
