NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of American Electric Power is range between $1.16 per share and $66.02 per share."
NEUT1|How are these values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying a dollar in $0.16 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have a dollar in $0.16 in cash and cash equivalents paying $66.02 per share represents the price per share or the fractional payment that me or you would pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT4|So conservative way to value the company.
NEUT5|And it's different from their price earnings ratio.
NEUT6|So the question becomes, what is American Electric do and what are they currently trading at today?
BEAR7|Well, they're currently trading at a price of $90.26 per share, which means that they are overpriced according to our intrinsic value calculation.
NEUT8|Well, what do they do?
NEUT9|They are a major investor owned electric utility in the United States of America, and they deliver electricity.
BULL10|So as far as the PE ratio, there are three .36 points above our upper threshold, which isn't bad compared to other companies.
NEUT11|The price per share is is elevated pretty dramatically if you take into consideration the high range versus you know what it's actually trading at, so we would want to wait.
NEUT12|The reasonable thing would be to wait until this price drops beneath $66.02.
NEUT13|That way we don't risk our capital.
NEUT14|You know we maintain the safety safety principle with an ample margin of safety, but don't keep your money in the bank.
NEUT15|What's the alternative?
NEUT16|So if you were looking at an investment in American Electric Power or some alternative that is lower risk but.
NEUT17|Offers a similar return.
NEUT18|I would advise that you take a look at the Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT19|Now, the reason I like the Vanguard 500 is because Warren Buffett used it to beat out the hedge fund.
NEUT20|Folks 08 through 18.
NEUT21|Anna Beth, which he won.
NEUT22|He just dropped his money.
NEUT23|He ran, let it grow, an he beat out the supposed experts who were supposed to be good at generating return.
BEAR24|But I guess not really because they weren't able to beat out 12.98% over the last 10 years.
NEUT25|So this is where I would park my money.
BEAR26|In the meantime, well, we'll be waiting for this price to drop beneath $66.02 per share.
