BEAR0|"""So I think a gold's price action so far this year it has been quite choppy, and I think this reflects some sort of recalibration of abuse."
BULL1|The this stimulus does raise inflation concerns and are supporting gold here, but then at the same time it does also raise outlook for for growth an in a way diminishes some of gold safe haven appeal.
NEUT2|But taking a step back or view is that you know real rates are likely to remain in negative territory.
BEAR3|The dollar is likely to continue to weaken and as uncertainty remains in place, goals continues to have a place in investor portfolios as a diversifier.
BULL4|OK, so it sounds to me like it's got a place that as a diversifier, but in terms of getting a lot of upside, maybe there are more downside risks over the course of this year.
NEUT5|Where would you see the price of gold ending up in December?
BULL6|So our base case is still to see higher gold prices this year, especially in the first half of of the year.
BULL7|I think inflation as inflation concerns sort of pick up that is likely to be an upside catalyst for gold.
BEAR8|I think the downside risks are increasing, especially if we do see consistently strong growth and again as I mentioned earlier, that diminishes sort of the appeal of gold as part of a portfolio, especially if strong growth does spring forward.
BULL9|"Policy normalization expectations from the set and therefore the prospect for gold for real rates to move higher materially, and perhaps approach positive territory, I think that will be the biggest downside risk for for gold."""
