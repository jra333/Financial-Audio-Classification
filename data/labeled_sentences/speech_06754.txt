BULL0|"""Welcome SMS St traders."
BEAR1|We got a very special trade here again Anna Weekly chart and a very alarming evidence is happening here that Goldman is selling down below that 210 week and at 20 week is kind of like holding that up.
NEUT2|So basically it's always the fact that every market top Goldman starts at lead just down and then the broader market follows and we're going into an earning season at Goldman.
NEUT3|Doesn't close above happened at SMF bar there.
NEUT4|And gain value and we sell through that ten week moving average.
NEUT5|We've done every bear and bull trend before an at every market top throughout this year.
BEAR6|Goldman has let us down.
NEUT7|And basically starting the year they let us down.
BEAR8|Then there was another long term trend down and so far Goldman is given a cell signal with that weekly gap down this week right here.
NEUT9|And it has a way of.
NEUT10|Running before the broader market catches up.
NEUT11|Plus we don't think the earnings season is going to be that good and with the Dow Jones getting a nice haircut today and things were sliding the bid into the closing Bell, we've got lots of plays where they went up, but nonetheless this is Goldman Sachs and on this weekly chart.
BEAR12|That ten week goes down in value and we closed below half of this bar.
NEUT13|Well, guess what?
NEUT14|That means that the broader market can follow, and Goldman has a way of doing it.
NEUT15|"Here's another weekly reversal I want you to be involved with right there so you know what's happening and that's the Goldman Weekly chart."""
