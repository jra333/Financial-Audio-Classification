NEUT0|"""Joining us as the analyst behind the call, Michael Pachter, Michael thank you for joining us."
NEUT1|You know, the whole thing with some of these retail trading frenzies and short squeezes, which fubo has gotten caught up in and does have a significant short interest, is that it's not fundamentally driven.
NEUT2|So why, then, are you raising your price target on the stock?
NEUT3|Yeah, good question.
NEUT4|And to be fair, I mean fubo is a real company, GameStop Surreal Company.
NEUT5|AMC's a real company.
NEUT6|So it's not like any of these, except perhaps AMC, was on the verge of bankruptcy.
NEUT7|The the math behind the short squeeze actually makes sense.
NEUT8|I I read the original wallstreetbets post and it's incredibly thoughtful and well reasoned, and I think it's a warning to shorts like don't short 100% of the outstanding shares because you're setting up the squeeze.
NEUT9|Fubo is a real company.
BEAR10|There's a lot of pessimism that they can't stand out that there are tons of offerings out there that they're, you know they're not competitive.
NEUT11|In fact, they have more sports than anybody.
NEUT12|And and what makes that a huge advantage is that cord cutters are looking for sports and sports is a natural for incremental add minutes, especially foreign sports.
NEUT13|So to the extent that these guys are showing you know, Spanish League or Italian League or English Premier League football, there's at least 10 or 12 minutes per hour that they can sell, which means that their ad ARPU goes from $6 currently to probably 12.
NEUT14|The companies talking 20, you know per subscriber per month.
NEUT15|That will get them to profitability in a couple of years, and the question is how big do they grow?
NEUT16|It's hard to throw a price target out there, but I think that with thirty million cord cutters in the US and these guys having only half a million subscribers, seeing them grow to three or 4,000,000 is likely.
NEUT17|Then they have sports betting as a free option and it really might pay off.
NEUT18|So they clearly have a lot of sports.
NEUT19|As you said Michael though it's mainly by bringing together and over the top version of other people.
NEUT20|Sports rights has traditionally been delivered.
NEUT21|Via cable, what is the level of threat to them?
NEUT22|If there are more moves like that of NBC, SN recently to shift everything to Peacock their own streaming service and or the likes of Amazon, buying more of the rights themselves and taking it away from the cable providers who are looking for a route to deliver rights they already had via over the top methods to the extent that those rights are exclusive, clearly fubo loses so.
NEUT23|If we see something like NFL football, you know that is it has exclusive rights to different networks or English Premier League.
NEUT24|Oh exclusive with NBC SN then sure, food was not going to get it, but if you're a true sports fan, it's it's just like subscribing to Netflix and Hulu and Amazon Prime.
NEUT25|You're going to end up with multiple services and Amazon is not going to be the over the top solution.
BEAR26|I think that people will get skinny bundles.
NEUT27|I think they'll get fubo, but you're right.
BEAR28|I mean, I think that if enough sports migrates away from fubo there in trouble.
NEUT29|I think that's the short.
BEAR30|That competition is going to put them out of business.
BULL31|I don't see Amazon getting enough bang for its Buck on exclusive sports, and I think they're going to be very targeted.
BULL32|OK, Michael, thanks for joining us.
BULL33|Much appreciate it.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
