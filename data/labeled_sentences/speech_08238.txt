NEUT0|"""But your next guest says that Amazon may be about to take off to four or even 5000 bucks a share."
NEUT1|Let's welcome in.
BULL2|Colin Sebastian, managing director and senior analyst at Baird Column, Good to have you on the program here.
NEUT3|You'll forgive me for looking down about to read parts of your note.
BEAR4|With the market currently focused on rotation to value rates, reopenings and tough ecommerce comps, we believe investors may be missing one of the most compelling subscription and quasi subscription models within the IT sector.
NEUT5|And there's a path of 5000.
NEUT6|Break it down because you know next quarter is the quarter when they boomed.
NEUT7|I don't know how they match those numbers.
BULL8|Yeah, thanks Brian for having me.
NEUT9|So I think what's missing when investors are currently very focused on the macro environment and not fundamentals is that Amazon has some really amazing long term growth opportunities and and the stock is trading at a pandemic low and in terms of valuation that as you as you outlined and in terms of recurring revenues or quasi subscription, you have the the core e-commerce business which is driven by prime subscribers and 3rd party sellers that are locked into Amazon's ecosystem.
NEUT10|And then, of course Amazon Web Services is a essentially a cloud subscription business, so all of that it means high retention rates, low churn, low customer acquisition costs.
NEUT11|We think this is one of the best models out there and and currently does not reflect in the valuation.
NEUT12|OK. Quasi subscription, what does that mean?
NEUT13|I see it as a subscription if you're paying prime every year.
NEUT14|Auto renew on your credit card, you don't even think about it.
NEUT15|Why quasi subscription?
NEUT16|Yeah, fair question.
NEUT17|So there are subscription elements specifically to Amazon like Prime, but really I'm talking about the whole business.
NEUT18|So all of the spending that those prime members make, they generate the vast majority of sales on Amazon.
NEUT19|So they are subscribers, but.
NEUT20|A lot of retail revenues on Amazon are not specifically subscription revenues, but we think are quasi subscription because they are tide to those prime members.
NEUT21|What's the biggest risk to your four or $5000 price target column?
NEUT22|Honestly, I find it not getting it.
NEUT23|Yeah, yeah, I think largely macro.
BEAR24|I think investors are concerned that if the growth stock rollover continues that support levels are pretty far below where we are today.
NEUT25|Obviously we look at it more from a fundamental basis.
BEAR26|Shares are trading at essentially a five year, five year low pandemic.
NEUT27|Low for sure.
NEUT28|So on that basis we don't see it as a significant risk.
BULL29|We hope it gets to 4000 this year, which is our 12 month.
BULL30|Price targets we think 5000 is achievable.
NEUT31|Amazon will be generating a trillion dollars of volume within three to four years and we think that's as I said, not recognized in the in the current valuation.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
