NEUT0|"""I would say yes."
BULL1|I would say earnings are coming in better than expected as Dome was just saying whether you look at it in terms of breath we've got about a 77 and 78, you know percent of companies beating.
NEUT2|That's after you know Q4 where you know it doesn't look like such a big deal that only 68% of companies were beating.
BEAR3|But that was actually a seven year low.
NEUT4|So companies generally beat number 1 #2 the size of the beat.
NEUT5|As he mentioned, you know his re calculated as closer to six and a half percent which compares with the typical beat of sort of 3 1/2% so.
BULL6|Either way you cut it, I would say earnings are better.
NEUT7|You know then expected modestly so so Gators.
BULL8|How bullish you on US equities, you telling clients to be significantly overweight.
NEUT9|So what I would say basically is that you know very, very near term.
BULL10|I would say the market sort of playing out the typical earnings season script which is you know, out of the last 24 earning seasons in 20 of them, the markets been up by an average of about 3%.
BULL11|So that would suggest we are sitting at around 2% up.
NEUT12|Since JP Morgan reported so, you got another percent to go to hit the average and at that point I would.
NEUT13|I mean, I think we will get there so a little longer a little bit further, but I would argue after that then they may be as closely as the end of this week when earnings are mostly basically done and you know the markets are ready for a sort of typical 3 to 5% pullback, it's going to be basically a little bit over four months since we had three percent pullback, we typically get them every.
NEUT14|Two to three months that driven by positioning, and I would argue positioning.
NEUT15|You know if you look across the segments is either long or you go well.
NEUT16|In Sweden, getting there quickly.
NEUT17|Jack.
BULL18|As I mentioned, we've got an exciting week coming up a jobs report.
NEUT19|A Fed meeting, resumption of trade talks, tons of earnings.
NEUT20|What do you think is going to be most important?
NEUT21|I think earnings are really the story here.
NEUT22|You look at earnings are the mother's milk of the market and what we have been seeing over the course of these last few weeks is really surprising.
NEUT23|In fact, it is shifting the psychology of the marketplace.
NEUT24|Sarah look, you know.
NEUT25|Everyone's been asking why this is happening.
NEUT26|Why did everybody miss it?
NEUT27|Even the IMF came out and actually missed all of this and a lot of it has to do with the fact that repatriation in and of itself is not instant gratification.
NEUT28|And I had to explain this to a few customers in a few traders.
NEUT29|Remember it takes literally.
NEUT30|Anywhere from 6 to 9 months to unwind.
NEUT31|Assets that are held overseas then of course, the board has to decide what to do with them and then you implement the action.
NEUT32|What we are going through right now is actually the implementation of what we have been expecting over the course of the last 9 to 10 months and that is a lot of cap ex starting to hit the marketplace.
NEUT33|It's doing it in a very covert manner by the way and it's doing it with a lot of money on the sidelines, which is one of the reasons we continue to see these markets going at all time highs.
NEUT34|"Even without a resolution out of China yet, imagine where we would be if we had any resolution with the trade tariff situation."""
