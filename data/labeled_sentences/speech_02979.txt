NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to Joe Vester trades.
NEUT2|My name is Joseph, and in today's video I'll be showing you why you need to keep Facebook on your watch list.
NEUT3|It is setting up as a great swing trade and I'll show you guys exactly what to look for on the charts.

NEUT6|So now that we have Facebook pulled up on the chart, I'm going to show you guys why you should be keeping this on your watch list.
NEUT7|So the first thing I'm going to go over is the entry.
NEUT8|The next thing I'll cover is the stop loss and then the last thing I want to show you guys are the areas you should be taking profits.
NEUT9|So if we go over to the daily time frame on Facebook will see that it's clearly in an uptrend an we are trading in this trend now.
NEUT10|Now I like to look for areas where it's a good buying opportunity and right here we can see that this red line is the 200 SMAD an this moving average can act as support.
BULL11|Right here we see Facebook bounced off of it last week and rose up to about 285 and right now it's approaching this moving average again.
NEUT12|So if we see Facebook bouncing from this moving average on Monday or Tuesday, I would look to go long on this stock.
NEUT13|You can buy shares, or you can buy a call option.
NEUT14|However, if it doesn't hold this moving average, I'll show you guys the best spot to be buying this stock.
BULL15|And right now I see that there is a clear support level right here at about 246.
NEUT16|As you can see, it's respected this level plenty of times.
BULL17|In the past we see it bounce from this level right here.
NEUT18|It also bounce from the level right here as well, so Facebook doesn't bounce from that 200 moving average on the daily timeframe.
NEUT19|Look to go long on the stock at this level.
NEUT20|This is a easy buying opportunity.
NEUT21|Now the second thing I want to go over is the stop loss.
NEUT22|Right under this support line is where you should keep the stop loss.
BEAR23|Right around 240-2243 is where I would cut my position.
NEUT24|If you go along around support levels and then the areas where you want to take profit is first around here, I'll show you guys in a second.
NEUT25|I would take profits right around this 270 area.
NEUT26|And then the next area I would like to take profits is around 285 and if we go over to Robin Hood I'll show you guys the exact contract that would be good for this play.
NEUT27|Right here I have Facebook pulled up an I have it selected on the February 19th expiration.
NEUT28|This gives it enough time to play out and if we scroll up the strike price that I like the most is the 275.
NEUT29|We can see that it's $443.00 and if we look at the volume it has a lot of people already in this contract and the Delta and Theta aren't that bad and if we go back to the chart will see that.
BULL30|Also Facebook reported earnings last week and they actually reported good earnings but they sold off.
NEUT31|With the rest of the market on Friday, so look to go long on this stock pretty soon.
NEUT32|An if you are down on this dog, it's a stock that you shouldn't mind being down on.
NEUT33|Its Facebook.
BULL34|It always goes up in the long term as you guys can see Facebook sold off with the rest of the market on Friday and it is approaching a great level to buy at.
