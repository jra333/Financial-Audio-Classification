NEUT0|"""Alright, let's turn our attention now to stock that's under quite a bit of pressure this morning and that is beyond meat."
BEAR1|The company last night coming out with a quarter that was quite disappointing for investors across the board.
BEAR2|Their slowest revenue growth since going public back in the spring of 2019.
BEAR3|We see shares here off some 22%.
NEUT4|Brian Sozzi and I know you went through the call.
NEUT5|You went through the release from the company.
NEUT6|There's a number of troubling dynamics here for beyond, but we kind of just start with when you're a growth business, you can't come out and say we grew.
NEUT7|What 2% quarter over quarter?
NEUT8|Yeah miles this one this quarter is tough to take.
BEAR9|I think we're seeing in terms of the market action beyond meat shares have been are down by over 20%.
NEUT10|That's pretty much what you were seeing in the after market hours after the earnings last night.
BEAR11|This is a reset I think on the stocks multiple because now investors after quarter like this are reassessing the company's gross profit growth prospects for 2021 on the earnings call.
BEAR12|They did not hide the fact that their food service business restaurants under pressure.
BEAR13|A lot of these indoor dining rooms are under pressure, they're closed.
NEUT14|By the big fast food restaurants or delaying putting new items on the menu can't, we won't include Pizza Hut in there because Yum Brands Pizza Hut now linking up with Beyond Meat.
NEUT15|We learned that this morning Alisa Miles lots of focus on the growth rate for the business.
NEUT16|But also McDonald's founder Ethan Brown noted on the call their relationship.
BULL17|McDonald's is very strong.
BEAR18|That is important, especially after the stock fall yesterday on news in McDonald's coming out with a plan burger.
NEUT19|I mean he can say whatever he wants about the relationship with McDonald's or with anybody else, right?
NEUT20|But if McDonald's decides to go its own way and just make its own burger without a partnership of Beyond Meat?
NEUT21|You know, then that's what's going to happen, right?
NEUT22|I mean, if you look at the rising competition, I mean, if you go into many grocery stores now, you'll see a lot of different choices in your freezer case.
NEUT23|It's not just beyond meat, and that's really an explosion that's happened in the last 12 to 18 months, right?
NEUT24|So Nestle?
BEAR25|Of course, as you well know, Brian is making one of these things now too impossible is still there, so I think that's going to continue to be an issue going forward as well, both from the fast food chains themselves.
NEUT26|And then other Consumer Packaged Goods companies that are making these things all McDonald's Julie just has to get its hands off.
BEAR27|It's off its rear end.
NEUT28|I mean because all the bureaucracy and McDonald's is playing out with the launch of this new plant burger.
BEAR29|It's ridiculous.
NEUT30|This has been going on for about a year and a half and now beyond me did come out yesterday and they said they have developed the burger.
NEUT31|The meat for the mic plant burger.
NEUT32|It's just a matter of is it branded with beyond meat?
NEUT33|I think McDonald's will still trying to figure it out.
NEUT34|Maybe it's buried under 2700 emails at corporate headquarters?
BEAR35|Yeah, I think the market did not like that headline yesterday.
NEUT36|You know, it's crazy beyond me.
BEAR37|Had a crazy day intraday before the earnings because of those McDonald's headlines where they came out said were involved.
NEUT38|Then it's like, well, it's going to be a big plant platform which doesn't involve beyond meat branding, so far as we can tell.
BEAR39|So that stock was kind of bouncing all over the place.
NEUT40|Just want to put a number on what you mentioned with the food service.
BEAR41|US Foodservice revenues were down 11% last quarter.
BULL42|The retail business up 40%, so you know.
NEUT43|It's.
NEUT44|It's not the mix that beyond Meat wants to be more durable, right?
NEUT45|Retail is going to be smaller part of the business, but again, you know it kind of speaks to the weakness I think.
NEUT46|Also that's happening in the restaurant space models.
NEUT47|I do get a big deal.
BULL48|We will probably get a boost in this fourth quarter.
NEUT49|This launch with Pizza Hut this morning.
NEUT50|Nationwide.
NEUT51|That's a pretty big deal for them.
NEUT52|Yeah, they're going to a lot more of that, and I think also, you know they're going to hope they can keep the beyond branding on that, right?
NEUT53|It's not.
NEUT54|Pizza Hut presents other meat.
NEUT55|It needs to be beyond meat with Pizza Hut, which it is right now, but I think they need all of that that they can get going.
NEUT56|"Power."""
