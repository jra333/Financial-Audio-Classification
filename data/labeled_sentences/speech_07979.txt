NEUT0|"""So roughly, six months ago I wrote an article to Seeking Alpha titled Why You should sell Netflix and Buy Disney stock and it got rejected."
BEAR1|Which is OK because at the end of the day I got the last laugh.
NEUT2|Make sure to stick around and see why.
NEUT3|Also, make sure to smash that like button.
NEUT4|Seeking Alpha can see this.
NEUT5|This is a chart comparing Disney and Netflix is stock over the past six months.
NEUT6|Disney is the blue line.
NEUT7|Netflix is the yellow line.
BULL8|At the beginning, Netflix stock was performing better.
BEAR9|But then Disney stock blew past Netflix.
BULL10|Over the past six months, Disney is up 53% and Netflix is up 12%.
NEUT11|So here's the email, your article why you should sound Netflix and buy Disney stock has been declined.
NEUT12|In general, we encourage authors to avoid articles that discuss multiple stocks, blah blah, blah blah blah.
NEUT13|So this does not add value.
NEUT14|What do you mean this does not add value?
NEUT15|I wrote an 8 page article explaining why you should buy Disney stock, but then on the same day there's this article sell Apple and by Alphabet.
BEAR16|So then that made me feel like that was a bit hypocritical.
NEUT17|What happened to don't write about two really large companies?
NEUT18|This doesn't add value.
NEUT19|We don't like to compare big companies.
NEUT20|What happened to that?
NEUT21|Is that not the same thing?
NEUT22|And I don't know about you, but I don't really like hypocrites and again.
NEUT23|It's not like I didn't put a lot of time into this.
NEUT24|I wrote an 8 page article I wrote about the fact that Disney owns 6% of Draft Kings and the fact that Disney owns ESPN.
BULL25|So it has great synergies with draft case, but the fact that Disney produced seven of the top ten grossing films in the world last year, I told them how I thought Disney Plus was going to be a huge success.
NEUT26|They already had 60 million subscribers.
NEUT27|Now they have 100,000,000.
NEUT28|And I even ran my discounted cash flow model, which valued Disney stock at $195 per share at the time it was trading at 1:35 today when I filmed this, it was at 200, so I said I'm done with Seeking Alpha and started my YouTube channel.
NEUT29|And the thing about You Tube.
NEUT30|They didn't deny me because let's be honest, it's way too time consuming to write an article compared to shooting a video and I don't have anyone telling me what I can and cannot post.
BULL31|It's great, so I just want to say thank you Seeking Alpha for giving me the motivation to start my YouTube channel and also for me putting in $10,000 into Disney on that day.
NEUT32|"Oh, and by the way, in case you're wondering, I plan on never writing the seeking off again, and I plan on their self conceited."""
