BEAR0|"""China's central bank is in a bind and it has to do with its currency, the yuan."
NEUT1|To understand how, let's take a look at the concept of something called the Impossible Trinity, otherwise known as the trilemma.
NEUT2|This is an economic theory that says a country can't have a controlled exchange rate, free flow of capital and an independent monetary policy at the same time a country can control 2, but not all three for a long time.
BEAR3|China seem to defy this theory.
BULL4|It kept its exchange rate well in check, even in terms of turmoil.
NEUT5|For instance, during the 2008 financial crisis, it essentially pegged the yuan to the US dollar.
BULL6|At the same time, the central bank also slowly lifted controls on money flowing in and out of the country, which helped attract investors to its markets.
BULL7|It was able to do this while also keeping interest rates under control fingo three out of three.
BEAR8|But now China appears to be caught in the trilemma.
BULL9|That's because it's going all out to prevent its currency from weakening as fast as markets would like.
NEUT10|In other words, it's focusing its economic firepower on one leg of the triangle.
BULL11|A stable currency that makes it hard to prevent the other two sides from crumbling.
BULL12|The flow of capital is much more rigid, because China is so worried about the yuan weakening, it's made it much more.
BEAR13|Difficult for money to leave, but money is still leaking out and China has spent nearly $1 trillion of its foreign currency exchange reserves.
NEUT14|Buying back.
NEUT15|You want to keep the rates table?
BEAR16|What is perhaps even more worrying is that the defense of the currency's value appears to be holding monetary policy hostage.
NEUT17|Monetary policy is only independent if the central bank doesn't have other orders to follow.
NEUT18|Experts say that in China now the central bank has to 1st consider the effect on the currency before providing banks with more funds to lend.
NEUT19|In other words, it is putting all its money on the yuan, focusing on only one leg of the triangle.
NEUT20|Is it worth it?
NEUT21|"Well, that's the next trillion dollar question."""
