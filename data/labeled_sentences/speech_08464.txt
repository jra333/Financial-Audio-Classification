NEUT2|Everyone Eric to trim here for Zacks.com.
NEUT3|Coming at you with your latest earnings news and analysis.
NEUT4|Today we're taking a quick look at Disney ahead of its report on 1110 after the Bell.
BEAR5|Now, Disney is obviously one of the best known names in the media world, but there's been a lot of concerns about this company.
BEAR6|And really, the larger media space thanks to this whole cord cutting trend, and especially for Disney's ESPN Division, this is likely to weigh in the company stock.
BEAR7|And as we can see over the last couple of months here, it's really been a big factor in its decline.
BEAR8|Shares were at about $103.00 a share to start the year, but since then they've tumbled back a bit here and are now trading in this low 90 range.
BULL9|Investors should note, though, that the company does have a pretty solid track record when it comes to beating earnings estimates, and it's only missed once in the last five years.
NEUT10|However, there are some concerns if we look to the recent earnings estimates for Disney and that that's pretty evident when we look at this chart as well.
BEAR11|2016 numbers were on an upward slope here, but since they've fallen back just a tad while 2017 numbers are also sloping.
BEAR12|Downward as well.
NEUT13|Now this is part of the reason that Disney was just rank to sell.
BEAR14|It has since moved out of that an into hold territory, but given the bottom 25% rank for the media sector at large, it's not really great situation heading into the release for Disney.
NEUT15|But if investors want to know how to trade Disney and what to look for in this company's report when it comes to trading with options, make sure to tune into Dave Bartosiak Sax Live Trader on YouTube where he's going to be talking about this company and others.
NEUT16|Until then.
