BEAR0|"""So today we experienced yet another fun day filled with drama and falling stocks of the AMC time."
NEUT1|So we're going to be running through and why I believe it's not that scary, at least not yet anyway.
NEUT2|Hello, and welcome to craziness.
NEUT3|Songs with your host crazy, yeah, you know around here, welcome and if you're returning member then welcome back.
BULL4|If you're one of those new folks would be highly appreciated.
NEUT5|If you go hit that red button down below and turn on the Bell just so you can keep updated with daily stock videos.
NEUT6|Either way, let's get into the topic.
NEUT7|So AMC.
BEAR8|It's been quite an interesting day as it is all time low ever since it started getting pumped by the Wall Street bets, such antics at all time low of which is a $5.79 in mark.
NEUT9|Yeah, not a fun thing to look at.
NEUT10|Not gonna.
NEUT11|Not gonna lie about that one.
NEUT12|Hey, let's be real here.
NEUT13|In reality they just want us to free account they wanted to sell off and make that stock crash.
NEUT14|So those billionaires betting on AMC to Crash won't have to pay billions of dollars into money about the stock.
NEUT15|Not crap 'cause let's keep it $1.50 here.
NEUT16|It's not over yet.
BEAR17|There's definitely just a good old waiting period to come up next for 100% honest with myself, we already know who are trying to scare everyone to pull out now and make the stock crash even further than what it already has.
NEUT18|Lovely hedge funds and billionaires that are betting on the stocks to crash information going around the current minute is rumored to say that these guys have to match the stocks that they shorted by Tuesday, sensually.
NEUT19|Meaning if true tomorrow.
NEUT20|Maybe an extraordinary.
NEUT21|Interesting day when it comes to holding AMC, so I recommend that at this point in time you hold you hold harder than you've ever held a stock before.
NEUT22|Now again, I'm not a financial advice.
NEUT23|I have to make that clear so it's always a safe bet to check with another financial advisor or actually go through some research yourself to find out a bit more information.
NEUT24|Because I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just a guy trading with stocks.
NEUT25|So whilst watching AMC slowly fall down today, wasn't fun.
BULL26|Pretty much telling us that there are definitely people selling a lot right now and she is kind of not fun to watch happen because as I said, the stock is just going down, but if that information that I said just a moment ago ends up being the case, then to those people who held out for the entire T of this run will be rewarded with some beautiful gains tomorrow.
NEUT27|If it turns out to not be the case and nothing big happens tomorrow, then I would still recommend holding onto your stocks, specially if you selling would mean that you'd be selling in the negatives because it's honestly just an overall not the greatest move to do, especially considering.
BULL28|That is, AMC's is a very high likelihood that over the next couple of months AMC will probably start to rise again as cinema start to open back up.
NEUT29|But again, I have to make sure you understand.
NEUT30|I'm not a financial advisor, so I'd make sure run through with an actual financial advisor or do some research yourself.
NEUT31|Either way, let me know what you think about this in the comments down below.
NEUT32|Do you think tomorrow is going to be an exciting day or do you think tomorrow she's going to be another one of those average AMC days?
