NEUT0|"""It's clear in this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Quite eventful day on this one.
BULL4|Once again, higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT5|An very nice final 30 minutes of the day.
BULL6|You can see good solid green candle and you combine that with maybe not the biggest volume bar of the day, but certainly very respectable volume and then even right now in the after hours the price is still showing a little bit of strength there.
NEUT7|But pointer being updates certainly need to be made as I'm sure there's gonna be plenty of eyeballs watching this one moving forward.
NEUT8|So the 1st update that I'm going to do here is actually just some house cleaning.
NEUT9|Get rid of that level.
NEUT10|Sure, that level still pertains, just not relevant right now.
NEUT11|And from a presentation standpoint I'd want to risk losing.
NEUT12|You know confusion and clutter, colors lines are really long, so let's try to keep this as clean as possible.
NEUT13|First update, though comes about based on a foundational role in charting, which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed above you want to see them act as support, and that's what played out perfectly today.
NEUT14|So 127 is now going to be that ideal level of support.
NEUT15|Ideal meaning for asking will play won't make this chart look the best moving forward.
BULL16|Well, yeah, ideally if the price and say above 127, that would be a fantastic sign of strength.
BEAR17|And don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that area, that doesn't mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL18|That would certainly be a great sign of power.
NEUT19|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT20|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT23|Just watch up line as long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|Hiring must visualize that.
NEUT25|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT26|Yes and above 127 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100%.
NEUT27|On the sharp as far as areas of resistance, gotta squeeze down the chart here.
NEUT28|'cause as you're seeing here, it's been quite awhile since the price went up this high.
NEUT29|So next key, overarching level of resistance now to watch very closely going to be right up there at one 2865.
NEUT30|So keep a close eye on that.
NEUT31|But overall in the price, continue supporting those higher highs and higher lows, and that is by far what matters most.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird.
NEUT37|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT38|But in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
