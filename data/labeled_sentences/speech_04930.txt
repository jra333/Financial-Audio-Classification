NEUT0|"""Alright, let's get to the stocks on our radar."
NEUT1|This week will bring in our man, Steve Rado, in from the other side of the glass to hit you with the question.
NEUT2|Jason Moser.
NEUT3|You first, what are you looking at?
NEUT4|Sure, as NDP holding we have today Boston Beer Ticker S AM and I was reading this week a conference call.
NEUT5|The meeting of the malts.
NEUT6|I just love that name, but **** Yuengling, Jim Cook and Ken Grossman, the founders of Yuengling Brewery.
NEUT7|Boston Beer in Sierra Nevada were talking a lot about the saturation in the craft room market today, and I think a lot of people aren't really taking.
NEUT8|A long enough view here in that.
NEUT9|A lot of these breweries are very small.
NEUT10|They are not built to last, and in the venture capital that's investing a lot of money in those funds have finite lives at well.
NEUT11|At some point they're going to be wanting to realize returns on those investments.
BULL12|Boston Beer has a very good competitive advantage, not only the brand, but the distribution and the production facilities it has today.
NEUT13|Not to mention a very smart leader.
NEUT14|And Jim Cook, so I think this is a business we plan on holding on for a long time.
NEUT15|And NDP.
NEUT16|Steve question about Boston beer.
NEUT17|Do you have a favorite bad beer?
NEUT18|Boston Beer is a good one.
NEUT19|You have a favorite bad one, so you're talking about just your regular old kind of a mass brubeck.
NEUT20|You know, I I was in the golf business a lifetime ago, and Greenville, SC.
NEUT21|It was all about the silver bullet sneaker, James early.
NEUT22|What are you looking at?
NEUT23|I'm going with this stock called Omni Comm.
NEUT24|This is an income investor recommendation and this is a stock that I just I've tried hard to get people to love it, just it's just tough because it's sort of like steak.
NEUT25|It at a seafood restaurant.
NEUT26|It's a it's a dividend stock, but it's an advertising company.
NEUT27|It's a company that the TV show called Mad Men was based on his great margin.
NEUT28|Profits 4040 something percent return on equity.
NEUT29|I'm looking at the numbers right now.
NEUT30|2.4% yield isn't huge.
BULL31|The stock is up 10% this year.
NEUT32|I think it's an overlooked dividend stock just because it's in a weird industry and the ticker, OMC Steve.
NEUT33|If I were a layperson, how would I begin to make sense of the advertising industry?
NEUT34|And what makes a good business in that space?
NEUT35|It's cyclical.
NEUT36|Obviously, talent is what's useful, but this company has a bunch of different agencies so they can serve competing businesses.
NEUT37|So normally, if your Coke and I'm Pepsi, we wouldn't go to the same agency because of conflict of interest.
NEUT38|But if one parent company has many different sub agencies then they can do.
NEUT39|That Omnicom does, that's part of their business model run gross, what are you looking at?
NEUT40|Steve?
NEUT41|I gotta go back to Perry Ellis, which I know you know well PR why they're quietly becoming a stronger business under the radar as they execute on their strategic plan reports.
NEUT42|They report fourth quarter results next week.
NEUT43|Stocks currently trading at a PE of 10.
BEAR44|It looks very undervalued.
NEUT45|Steve.
NEUT46|How does Perry Ellis get away from being the TJ Maxx brand that we have come to love?
NEUT47|I don't know if they need to necessarily get away from it, they just need to get the right merchandise at the right.
BULL48|Price points into the stores and they think if they stick to their bread and butter than sales will grow in profits along with them.
NEUT49|What do you like, Steve?
NEUT50|I'm going with Omnicon, is that it?
NEUT51|James it is.
BULL52|Thank you so much.
BULL53|I must've sold it well yeah yeah.
BULL54|Alright guys, thanks for being here.
BULL55|"Thank you Chris."""
