BULL0|"""I also want to spotlight the action we've been talking about all week as Bitcoin inches ever closer here to those record highs that we've seen getting close to 19 K here."
NEUT1|Wanna be on Yahoo Finance's Dan Roberts with the latest in incredible Bitcoin run, we've seen Dan.
NEUT2|Yes, akiko.
NEUT3|I'll start by saying as I always say, when the when the price is running up that it's never really just one thing.
NEUT4|People like to point to one headline.
NEUT5|For example after PayPal came out and said that PayPal will soon allow buying and holding and paying with cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin.
BULL6|But a number of cryptocurrencies ever said OK. Prices rising thanks to PayPal.
NEUT7|That is certainly one thing that has contributed, but really right now there's a lot happening.
BULL8|There's a lot of momentum.
BULL9|There's been big institutional adoption over the last couple years.
NEUT10|Grayscale, for example.
NEUT11|They are frequent guest on our live shows.
NEUT12|They just came out and said that their overall crypto assets now exceed $10 billion under management.
NEUT13|Very interesting.
NEUT14|They've got a number of different funds.
NEUT15|There's PayPal there square, which of course back in 2018 Square started allowing buying and trading of Bitcoin from its cash app.
NEUT16|But also this year.
NEUT17|Square went ahead and just invested in $50 million worth of Bitcoin separate from cash app as an asset on its balance sheet.
NEUT18|Paul Tudor Jones within the last six months, a big name on Wall Street came out and said he's putting 1% of his portfolio into Bitcoin and just today, the CIO of fixed income at BlackRock came out and said that he believes Bitcoin is durable, that it's here to stay.
NEUT19|You're hearing a change in rhetoric from a lot of these people.
NEUT20|You're seeing institutions invest something in many cases, just dipping a toe in, but even that fuels the idea that.
NEUT21|Even if certain firms aren't saying boy, this is the future, we're all in there saying we believe it's going to stick around.
NEUT22|We believe it's here to stay now.
NEUT23|It's also really interesting.
NEUT24|Sort of an inside baseball media perspective.
BEAR25|This huge run we're seeing right now, I'd argue, has been almost a little quiet in sense of the media.
NEUT26|I mean, we all remember exactly three years ago, the end of 2017.
BEAR27|It was a frenzy of coverage, people freaking out and saying, Oh my God, what's happening here?
NEUT28|The running joke was that everyone was talking about it with their grandparents at the Thanksgiving table.
NEUT29|I don't think that's gonna happen this time because of covid.
NEUT30|But it's a little quieter at this time, and maybe actually, arguably, that shows that people are less surprised by it.
NEUT31|They're more aware that that Bitcoin is an asset that exists.
BULL32|Some seems digital gold, and there's increasing adoption by various companies.
NEUT33|Then yeah, I agree with you.
NEUT34|Three years ago it was impossible to trade Bitcoin when Bitcoin was hit 1819 thousand, it would take 10 minutes, 30 minutes for a transaction to clear the costs were high.
NEUT35|Now it's much more organized.
NEUT36|You got institutional involvement as we've been talking about just looking at the charts here.
BULL37|It is up 70% over the last two months and it looks like it's starting to go parabolic.
NEUT38|Doesn't mean it has to finish its move anytime soon, but I think for some perspective just look at the five year chart here.
BULL39|We consolidated for two 2 1/2 years, finally broke out and now we're getting some momentum to the upside.
NEUT40|I have some pretty high targets to the upside, but we'll have to see how this plays out.
NEUT41|Dan guys.
NEUT42|Yeah, I mean, as we've talked about the run up here is has taken a little bit more time to.
BEAR43|Perhaps that's why it maybe some media outlets have given a little bit less coverage than last time.
NEUT44|'cause it's not so sudden.
NEUT45|But we'll see where things go.
NEUT46|Team Roberts.
BULL47|"Appreciate you joining us on that."""
