BULL0|"""Hello everyone analytics."
NEUT1|So regarding the Amazon I think I published two video previously and none of my trade setups got confirmed on those videos.
NEUT2|I was considering a triangle like this and I mentioned if this level gets broken you can be the buyer so the crash happened but the fact is that the triangle idea is not still invalidated.
NEUT3|That's the problem with triangles in Elliott Wave.
NEUT4|Sometimes you are too early, but the triangle is still unfolding.
BULL5|So so far we had the wave.
NEUT6|A we had the wave B OK we are on a wave C perfectly makes sense we need a wave DNE and then go up.
NEUT7|OK so this is the scenario I'm having in mind we have to go for the Wave 5 let's see if the wave let me name them here so you can see things better.
NEUT8|So this is the wave a this is the wave BC probably a DNE let's see what will happen for Wave D. And if it's going to be the wave deal, is it going to be the start of the 5th wave?
NEUT9|I'm not still sure, but this is the.
NEUT10|Idea I have for Amazon and I still think Amazon needs one more wave up.
NEUT11|It can go even to this level 4057.
BULL12|"Thanks for watching and have a good day."""
