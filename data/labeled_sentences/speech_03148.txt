BEAR0|"""I mean look, I think particularly on with regard to the slowing of economic activity."
NEUT1|I mean, you know that that's always true, right?
BULL2|I mean, I think the defense is almost always going to be inclined to to ease rates if things slow.
NEUT3|I mean hopefully that you know, sort of an obvious point to everyone.
NEUT4|I think then that begs the sort of the natural question of, well, are things going slow.
NEUT5|We obviously no one can really get their head around coronavirus in in a very clear way.
BEAR6|I mean, I, I do think that the impact is going to probably be fairly modest overall.
NEUT7|And so I think then you know if if that conclusion is right, then I think it's really easy to conclude that the Fed is going to be on hold this year.
NEUT8|I mean, look, it's an election year and for better or for worse, you know the Fed is going to be a load to you.
NEUT9|Know, adjust policy one way or the other installation here.
NEUT10|Unless the economy absolutely demanded.
NEUT11|And again, I think that's effectively what they've been telling us.
NEUT12|So, Tom, you're basically at no rate cuts this year, right?
NEUT13|Right now no, no action from the Fed this year.
NEUT14|I mean look at, you know, the market obviously is pricing in some some policy action, right?
NEUT15|Like you know, just just the simple act of a cut, whether it's one or more cuts, you know the markets pricing in an 80% odds of that.
BEAR16|I think that is way too high.
BULL17|I think that the economic backdrop is actually going to move along in a pretty reasonable way, much as it did last year.
NEUT18|But yeah, that's where the market is right now.
NEUT19|We would disagree with that.
NEUT20|OK, Tom, thank you Tom for silly.
NEUT21|As with RBC, we turn to Kevin Cronin who's a senior portfolio manager with Washington Crossing Advisors.
NEUT22|Kevin, if Tom's right and the market has come around to the idea that there will be no more cuts this year, is that going to cause some upset?
NEUT23|No, not really, because ultimately what the what the market needs to see here is growth.
NEUT24|You had a lot of central banks coming in around the world cutting rates last year providing some stimulus, I think markets understand that that stimulus occurs with a lag.
BEAR25|And So what we would be expecting to see here is a pickup in global growth because we have had that stimulus now put in place around the world by central banks over the last 12 to 18 months.
BEAR26|We have also seen a drawdown in inventories in terms of the overall inventory stocking that occurred last year.
BEAR27|And the very weak growth last year, 3% looks to be the number for global growth.
BEAR28|That was much weaker than initial expectations by the IMF.
BULL29|We're actually hoping to see this latest improvement in activity continue into the into the year to come.
NEUT30|And if that happens, that would be the most bullish thing for stocks, because you could get some earnings growth, right?
BEAR31|So, Kevin, if that's the case, what you're describing is basically, you know, hey, we already kind of pumped in liquid ITI last year was bad for the global economy.
BULL32|We're going to start to get more traction this year.
NEUT33|Why is the 10 year at 1.5 barely over 1 1/2 percent?
NEUT34|I mean, does that make sense to you in the kind of scenario you're describing?
NEUT35|Well, no, no it doesn't.
NEUT36|In a traditional sense.
NEUT37|But keep in mind that we're in a world where you're allocating capital globally.
BEAR38|You're confronted with even lower interest rates in many parts of the world.
NEUT39|So go to Europe, go to Japan, and suddenly our rates look very competitive.
NEUT40|But on a stand alone basis, you're right.
NEUT41|The overall level of interest rates around the world is low from a historical perspective, and at some point we would expect to see rates normalized so that you have overtime you get you get.
BEAR42|"Rates here in the United States equal liberating if you will, with somewhere around nominal GDP, would land, but we're still going through this period of time post financial crisis where you've got these very low global rates, which is making it hard for our rates here in the United States to rise."""
