NEUT0|"""Welcome back, it's the 1st of October 2020, Thursday at 50 after week we're at #9 Bitcoin Azvi Weaver ticker BSV."
NEUT1|What's up crack right for BSV against BTC.
BEAR2|We are in a falling wedge here and usually falling wages break.
NEUT3|Twisty site usually more often than not.
BEAR4|It breaks towards the upside.
BULL5|Yeah, to be honest, more likely than not we should be seeing a break towards the US.
BULL6|I would love it if Bitcoin SV breaks towards the upside, if we start accumulating over here as the skinny pink line runs through right, this would be brilliant.
BULL7|Absolutely brilliant.
NEUT8|This would be the.
NEUT9|Via consolidation in palm accumulation and then we break towards the upside.
BULL10|This would be great to be honest.
NEUT11|However, however, we are not exactly sure if this is going to be what is going to happen, because if you look at Bitcoin SV against USD, things are not looking good, so let me show you the SV USD but before that please we do like.
NEUT12|Enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think we can see in the comments below for BSV against USD already forming mountain Ranges Mountain One Mountain two I think we're going to mountain #3 this is becoming a head and shoulders absolute classical hidden showed us to me.
NEUT13|Looks like that feels like that.
BULL14|I think more likely than not working, getting there so this looks like a hidden showed us right.
BULL15|I think we're getting a right shoulder over here.
NEUT16|Let's show this complete right shoulder.
NEUT17|Sorry.
BEAR18|Hit and we're going to get right shoulder.
NEUT19|Will probably keep the skinny pink line as resistance and then pump.
NEUT20|We drop lower right?
NEUT21|So looks at the field side.
BEAR22|Anything things are very weak for PS Vita.
NEUT23|Love coins are showing a lot of weaknesses and so you need to be very, very careful about going to trade too soon.
BEAR24|Things are still very uncertain for BSV, but more likely than not, I think that the direction of BSV is still down.
NEUT25|Assuming that there's still more downside to go for BSV.
BEAR26|If Bitcoin drops down to from 10 to 92827 if we drop to six or even 5K, OK, this can be so brutal or not because we because we could drop all the way down to.
NEUT27|Double digits, yeah.
BEAR28|More likely than not because he is going to drop down to double digits again, so.
BEAR29|That's just not looking good.
NEUT30|Absolutely not looking good for.
NEUT31|BSV not at this point of time, even this rally that is coming in right now.
NEUT32|You could feel that there is not much volume right.
BEAR33|There is pushing the price higher.
NEUT34|If you look over here the height of the ring volume bars are much higher than the height of the green volume bars, so you could tell that there's proper big selling coming in for Bitcoin SV.
BEAR35|An more likely than not, so the eventual direction is down.
NEUT36|So be very, very careful about going to trade too soon.
NEUT37|I still feel that things are very weak and be quiet.
BEAR38|We could still plunge lower, it's just that for BSV against BTC there is a falling wedge, and falling wages usually break towards the upside.
BEAR39|So I'm kind of conflicted in the sense.
BEAR40|On one side, BSV is bearish against USD, but against BTC it is kind of foolish I say so I'm kind of confused BSV you're confusing me.
NEUT41|Hi yeah, OK anyway yeah I guess this BSV technical analysis.
BULL42|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL43|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT44|"I shall see you in the next video."""
