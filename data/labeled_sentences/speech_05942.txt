NEUT4|How risky they are.
NEUT5|Take a GoPro for example.
NEUT6|I'm not just picking one company, I'm just giving you a good example of a company that basically is lost.
NEUT7|70% of its value never returned a dime to shareholders.
NEUT8|Or how about a company that's been around much longer?
NEUT9|Yahoo never paid a dividend.
NEUT10|It's never made money for anybody except all the CEOs that have gone through there and got whacked.
NEUT11|It's just a rotating door where management extracts capital.
NEUT12|Never returns any to shareholders and I look at that and say to myself, why don't I just avoid that altogether if it doesn't pay a dividend?
NEUT13|I know that 71% of the time all the returns come from dividends.
NEUT14|"Why should I want to talk, doesn't pay a dividend and I never will."""
