BEAR0|"""Kardashian affect shares up more than a percent and a half, but dipping slightly after Kim Kardashian West said she would freeze her Facebook and Instagram account, Kardashian posting."
NEUT1|I love that I can connect directly with you through Instagram and Facebook, but I can't sit by and stay silent while these platforms continue to allow the spreading of hate propaganda and misinformation created by groups to sow division and split America apart.
NEUT2|Again, this the statement right here by Kim Kardashian.
NEUT3|West Kardashian is a top ten personality on Instagram with 100.
NEUT4|88 million followers.
BEAR5|This decision may be a part of a 24 hour freeze being called for by a nonprofit called Stop Hate for Profit.
NEUT6|Several other big celebrities also expected to take part again.
BEAR7|Shares of Facebook up about a percent and a half, but falling slightly from the level they were before Kardashian West posted that back over to you.
NEUT8|This calling, though Frank for a one day boycott?
NEUT9|Yeah, very possible that we don't.
NEUT10|We haven't seen Kim Kardashian herself says she's taking part in the 24 hour boycott, but there is a group saying that they're going to do a 24 hour boycott.
NEUT11|"We believe she's part of that."""
