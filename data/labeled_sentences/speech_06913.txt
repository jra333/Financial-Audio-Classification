NEUT0|"""And then I think it's also important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy."
NEUT1|So the normal way that we conduct our lives as we we reason by analogy, it's we're doing this because it's like something else that was done.
NEUT2|Or it's like what other people are doing me to type ideas.
NEUT3|Yeah, it's like, yeah, slight iterations on a theme.
NEUT4|And and.
NEUT5|And it's it's kind of mentally easier to reason by analogy rather than from first principles, but by first principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world and what that really means is.
NEUT6|You kind of boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say OK, what are we sure is true or assure as possible is true?
NEUT7|And then reason up from there that takes a lot more mental energy.
NEUT8|Example that like what's one thing that you've done that on that you feel is work for you sure, so somebody could say in fact people do that.
NEUT9|Battery packs are really expensive, and that's just the way they will always be.
NEUT10|'cause that's the way they've been in the past.
NEUT11|So.
NEUT12|No, that's that's pretty dumb.
NEUT13|You know, because if if you apply that reasoning to anything new that then you wouldn't be able to ever get to that new thing, right?
NEUT14|So.
NEUT15|You know, it's like you can't say, oh, you know horses.
NEUT16|Well, nobody wants a car because horses are great and we're used to them and they can eat grass.
NEUT17|And there's lots of grass all over the place.
NEUT18|And you know, there's not like a.
NEUT19|There's no gasoline that people can buy, so people never gonna get never going to get cars right?
NEUT20|People did say that.
NEUT21|And for batteries they would say, oh, it's going to cost.
NEUT22|You know, historically it's cost.
NEUT23|Six, $600 per $600.
NEUT24|Per kWh and so.
NEUT25|It's not going to be much better than that in the future, and you say no, OK?
NEUT26|What are the batteries made of?
NEUT27|So first principles we say OK, what are the constituents of the batteries?
NEUT28|What is the spot market value of the material constituents?
NEUT29|So you can say OK, it's got cobalt, nickel, aluminum, carbon and some polymers for separation and steel can so break that down in on a material basis and say OK?
NEUT30|What if we bought that in the London Metal Exchange?
NEUT31|What would each of those things cost like?
NEUT32|Oh geez, it's like $80.00.
NEUT33|Per kWh, so clearly you just need to think of clever ways to take those materials and combine them into the shape of a battery cell.
NEUT34|"And you can have batteries that are much, much cheaper than anyone realizes."""
