BEAR0|"""Well guys today is the day where Nokia is the closest that it's being to its lowest since Wallstreetbets wallstreetbets shot it up like crazy."
NEUT1|And now we're almost at what it originally was.
BEAR2|Nokia I am very bullish on but this is terrible to see yo what is up?
NEUT3|Everyone thevan from market craze here.
NEUT4|If you're new here on the channel, welcome to the channel.
NEUT5|If you're returning member, welcome back.
NEUT6|So today we're going to be talking about Nokia.
NEUT7|Nokia is a company that has a lot of their hands.
BEAR8|In the five G area of everything going on and it really ***** that Nokia is losing a lot of its momentum that was built up by Wallstreetbets because I think that they could have benefited very highly from it.
NEUT9|But before I get into that, if you guys do enjoy stock market videos in stock market predictions uploaded daily, make sure to slap a like and subscribe and turn on post notifications.

NEUT11|Let's go ahead and jump on into this.
NEUT12|So today we're going to talk about Nokia, which honestly bro.
BEAR13|I've been very bullish on for awhile and it really stinks to see Nokia absolutely take this dip.
BEAR14|I've been losing a lot of money on Nokia because of the fact that I got in Nokia late.
NEUT15|I got in Nokia at 5:50 so F in the chat for me boys.
BEAR16|I mean, it's just absolutely been killing My Portfolio.
BEAR17|It is now down to 410 on the day and that really ***** to see it's been down 6% today.
NEUT18|An honestly, I don't even like looking at my Weible account right now.
NEUT19|It's just.
NEUT20|Absolutely making me so upset, but I think that there could be a bright side to this.
BEAR21|Obviously there's going to be a lot of sell offs right now with people that thought Nokia was the next AMC or GameStop, which obviously was not, and everyone is going to be selling off in everyone's going to be trying to make at least some of their money back and not absolutely go bankrupt.
NEUT22|But after that is over, I think we could see a very high amount of people buying back in a Nokia.
BULL23|I don't think we're going to see very positive returns within the next couple of days.
BEAR24|Actually, I think Nokia could be back down into the threes as early as Friday tomorrow, but I think Nokia could actually see a $10 price target as soon as middle of may middle of the summer, at least.
NEUT25|At least my price target.
BEAR26|If Nokia, please guys do not get greedy on Nokia and think Nokia is going to hit 15 thirty $45100 even please stop.
BEAR27|That is ridiculous thinking.
NEUT28|You have to think reasonable.
BEAR29|A $10 price target is completely reasonable, and if you bought in at $3, that is an insane return.
BEAR30|I am worried that a lot of new investors are getting greedy whenever they see a stock like GameStop and they got really lucky on GameStop.
NEUT31|They think that's going to happen all the time.
NEUT32|It's not stocks like that are very rare.
BEAR33|I do think Nokia will hit a low tomorrow.
BULL34|I think we're probably going to see a lot of red tomorrow and it's really going to **** but I think Nokia eventually will go up to $10.
