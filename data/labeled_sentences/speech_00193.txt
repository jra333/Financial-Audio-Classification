BEAR0|"""So yes guy today's a red day."
NEUT1|I would go over my mistake.
NEUT2|I couldn't.
BEAR3|It could have been a nice day, but I I being stubborn and being greedy and being a bag Holder, that's what caused me to lose.
BULL4|And so today I saw Mark was have a gap up, have good news and it's also bring out high day.
NEUT5|So I did not buy it.
NEUT6|When it Breakout High Day because I want to see if it break for two.
NEUT7|So I wait until we break for then I got in at 4:00 and I was risking off of 380 which is around here 380 and it goes my plan I was I have an order in to sell it 440.
NEUT8|But I was being greedy.
NEUT9|That would totally give me 10% within like before even the market even open.
NEUT10|But then I saw approaching my target pretty fast.
NEUT11|So I was like, oh man, what happened?
NEUT12|It's going to be like all the other play that happened this week.
NEUT13|Go up to like 100% whatever you know.
NEUT14|I don't want to miss out on that.
NEUT15|So I was being greedy and I hold it.
BEAR16|An I was I want to see where Tampa I did see that top out 4.45 which I start to enter my order at 4.50 right away but did not get field so I like **** drop so fast.
NEUT17|I came and enter my next order.
BEAR18|I should have noticed I had dropped below view app.
NEUT19|I should have got out Ray away when you drop this much below V WAP and I did not get out so I tried to put my order at 4.25 just when a rebound so I could get out but then again I saw approaching my target.
BEAR20|I cancel my 4.25 order.
BEAR21|Ice I was being so so stubborn and stupid and it dropped below my wrist and four point 80 risks and I did not cut it.
NEUT22|I was, I moved my wrist down to 4.50.
NEUT23|I like what happened this whole right here.
BEAR24|Which is really, really stupid idea.
NEUT25|I just want to get off of bounce.
NEUT26|You give me a bounce right here at 4.75.
NEUT27|I didn't take it.
NEUT28|Because I see ABCD.
NEUT29|I'm not good with using E trade chart.
NEUT30|I see an ABCD pattern type of thing you know, so I did not get out.
NEUT31|I keep holding on keep holding on and I was notice that even if you fit my ABCD pattern thing I should not even be in it in the 1st place right?
NEUT32|Because The thing is I don't play abdc under the V WAP for a reason.
BULL33|Yes it popped up to here continue downward.
NEUT34|I'm still dragging it, hold it hold.
NEUT35|Angest bag, you know I'm just being a bag Holder.
BEAR36|So yeah, it dropped below my target for 3:50 and I didn't.
NEUT37|I didn't take it I I didn't take it.
NEUT38|I didn't get out.
NEUT39|I was like OK, there's another risk right here which is 3.44 which is right here.
NEUT40|I like OK, Iris off of that and it break it too and like ****.
BULL41|OK I gotta get out so yeah I got out 3.40 that bring me from $200.10 percent gain.
BEAR42|To around like 13% loss I lost $342 today.
NEUT43|So yeah, my weekend up.
BULL44|I'm still positive for the week, but yeah, this week I couldn't make one grand turn out.
BEAR45|Oh man, it's just feel bad man.
NEUT46|Just feel bad being greedy kill, just learn from this mistake and I will make sure that I will cut my loss and take my profit and stop being greedy.
NEUT47|That's my lesson for myself today.
NEUT48|Thank you.
BULL49|"Have a good day."""
