BEAR0|"""As of two day shipping wasn't enough, Jeff Bezos today announced that they are going to be working on one day shipping, and because of that, one of the two biggest retailers such as Walmart and Target, aggressively sold off this morning, pushing down target over 8% down on the day and pushing Walmart down 4.5%."
BULL1|Since then, they have slowly recovered.
NEUT2|And why am I making this video?
NEUT3|Why am I making a video about two stocks that are selling off?
NEUT4|Why is that important?
NEUT5|Well, the question that I want to ask you is.
BEAR6|Do you think the news of Amazon offering one day shipping is detrimental and will continue to lead to a sell off to both target or Walmart?
NEUT7|And if you do that, obviously it wouldn't make sense to take part of Target or Walmart.
NEUT8|But if you think that this news is only relevant right now and after a matter of time it will become less relevant and then the price action will drive the price back up again, then why is that important?
NEUT9|Well, if you don't think the news of Amazon offering one day shift is going to last for a very long period of time.
NEUT10|Then maybe it makes sense because of this dip by opportunity that both Walmart and Target are something that maybe you should add to your watchlist and watch closely.
BULL11|As of right now based off of how they've recovered so far.
BULL12|Walmart has about a 2.5% margin for recovery while leaving target at a little bit over 5%.
NEUT13|Again, this in no way is any stock suggestion, but just like you guys know, we like to focus on getting a good deal.
BEAR14|So what better time to take advantage of an opportunity when some form of news is released that drives the price down, which increases the overall amount of panic sellers taking action.
NEUT15|Dropping the price down and after that news becomes less relevant than overall it makes sense on why the price will pick up.
NEUT16|Or does it?
NEUT17|Again, that's up to you, so I want to get your guys opinion about what you guys think about Amazon.
NEUT18|Offering one day shipping to all prime members.
NEUT19|And if you think that this is detrimental to both Walmart and Target, if you guys look at the 180 day 4 hour chart for both of these specific tickers, than you guys can have a better understanding not just on the fundamental side but also on the technical side of what can happen.
BULL20|So I hope that you guys enjoy this video.
