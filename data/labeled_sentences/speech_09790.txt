BEAR0|"""Another roller coaster day for GameStop."
BEAR1|The stock dropped a whopping 44% as small online investors ran into a roadblock in their trading war with Wall Street short sellers.
BEAR2|Basically, big investors were trying to make money by betting the stock price would drop if it rose they would take a loss.
NEUT3|KPIX 5 Wilson Walker reports new at 6:00 o'clock.
NEUT4|That's when an army of small investors assembled on social media and went.
NEUT5|Into battle if you have been following or trying to untangle this story, you know GameStop is not really driving the story.
NEUT6|It is more of an accidental passenger in a larger story, and that is individual investors taking on hedge funds and rattle ING.
NEUT7|Wall Street.
NEUT8|The people put their money in and Wall Street lost the bet and they need to pay.
BEAR9|Protesters gathered outside the offices of Robin Hood markets in Menlo Park today.
NEUT10|Robin Hood is a Commission free trading app that lets people buy and sell stocks without a broker.
BEAR11|It is also how an army of Reddit users upended the hedge funds that wanted to short sell struggling GameStop.
NEUT12|Those redditors started buying.
BEAR13|They sent the stock price soaring and that cost a couple of Wall Street hedge funds about $5 billion.
NEUT14|At that point, Robinhood put restrictions on trading.
NEUT15|GameStop specifically.
NEUT16|They're changing the rules.
NEUT17|They lost their bet.
NEUT18|They need to pay, and the people are because this is people's money.
NEUT19|It interesting isn't understand that the administration is taking a look.
NEUT20|All of this from the short squeeze to the trading restrictions has grabbed the attention of lawmakers in Washington, the New York Attorney General, and anybody who pays attention to the stock market.
NEUT21|Yeah, I covered it with my PhD students this morning.
NEUT22|It's amazing Stanford Professor Darrell Duffie teaches us that things have changed that we're in a world in which.
NEUT23|A fringe set of investors, possibly a large number of them, really like to cause havoc for hedge funds, especially those that are shorting firms.
NEUT24|But I think this will calm down after a point and and maybe a change in regulation will be called for or some investigation.
NEUT25|But the Anti Wall Street sentiment that drove this that is not going away.
NEUT26|The people that were putting stuff on Reddit, they outsmarted Robin Hood and the stock market.
NEUT27|And I think that's the bigger pictures that Robin Hood in the and Wall Street.
BEAR28|"They were very upset because they've got fooled in Menlo Park, Wilson Walker, KPIX box."""
