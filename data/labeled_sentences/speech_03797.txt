BULL0|"""Yeah, Sheryl Sandberg has an interesting post this morning guys."
NEUT1|Of course, they're meeting with organizers of the boycott and civil rights advocates today, but says that they're making these changes.
NEUT2|For example, David WhatsApp no longer responding to Hong Kong requests for user data in terms of law enforcement, along with Microsoft and Facebook, Twitter, and Google.
NEUT3|But she says we're making the changes, not for financial reasons or advertiser pressure, but because it's the right thing to do so.
BULL4|And that's going to be met with a healthy dose of skepticism, Dave.
NEUT5|As it should be, I think as it should be given we watch what Mr. Zuckerberg has done, says it will do.
NEUT6|It typically does come down to to making sure the bottom line of the company is protected.
NEUT7|Facebook, you know we talked a lot about Mike about the advertisers who are at least pausing at this point.
NEUT8|So many big names.
BEAR9|But really it hasn't done much to slow the momentum of the stock.
NEUT10|Many investors there simply come back to a multiple that they say is 20 times gap earnings.
NEUT11|Yeah, no exactly now.
NEUT12|What's interesting too is you can frame it.
NEUT13|A couple of different ways.
BEAR14|One is that the stock appears kind of bulletproof to these concerns, and obviously investors are not registering any real worry that it's going to cause the advertiser flight for any long period of time.
BEAR15|But if you look at data compared to what you might consider its peers, Google's outperformed an everything else in Phangan Fang adjacent stocks as well outperformed Google.
NEUT16|So it seems as if the market is differentiating a little bit here between AD supported and not ad supported digital platforms.
BULL17|Yeah, yeah, well right as you say I mean apples googles up or alphabets up 12% this year.
BULL18|Facebook 17% year to date.
NEUT19|Yeah year today you give you dial back a little more to about a year.
NEUT20|It's a similar story though, whereas you know Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft have just blown him away.
BULL21|Amazon is incredible, 64 percent is the increase so far this year.
BULL22|Again still above 1 1/2 trillion.
BEAR23|Though still trailing Apple and Microsoft in the old market.
BULL24|"CAP leadership wars."""
