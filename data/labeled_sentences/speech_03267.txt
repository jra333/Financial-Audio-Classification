BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This be a video chart on ticker symbol FLEX.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Quite the eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but if you look down here at the volume well above average volume on the day.
NEUT6|So let eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT7|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support very well defined.
NEUT9|I mean, I'm not going to count the number of times, but numerous occasions the price was down in there right at that round Number of $14.00.
NEUT10|And as you can see there every single time the Bulls did a fantastic job of holding strong, so 14 deafening to be.
NEUT11|I'm not going to do or die level of support, but certainly an area where yeah, preferably speaking.
NEUT12|You're going to want to see the price they above that area, so definitely be sure to watch that level very closely going forward.
NEUT13|Now, in the event that level does not hold up, then as far as the overarching level of support is concerned, that's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT14|The very famous, very well known 50.
NEUT15|Simple Moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT16|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT17|You must visualize that.
NEUT18|That is what is being represented in yes, and about 14 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT19|Initial level going to be right here at $14.50.
NEUT20|Let me make sure there yeah 1445 and then after 1445 next level up here at the $14.80 mark but All in all any angle you look at it.
BULL21|Great volume today.
BEAR22|Huge price movement.
NEUT23|Not just a question of Canada price build upon this momentum next week.
NEUT24|Let's see what happens.

NEUT26|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT27|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL28|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT29|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT30|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR31|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT32|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT33|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
