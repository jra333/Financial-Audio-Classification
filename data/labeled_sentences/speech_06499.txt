NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another episode of Bubble Trading."
NEUT1|Today.
NEUT2|I'm gonna be doing some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency H bar, so Hadera Hashgraph I'm going to look at it against tether US on binus all going to be charged on tradingview.
NEUT3|As a disclaimer, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT4|This video is not financial advice.
NEUT5|If you're going to do any investing, go speak to a certified financial advisor.
NEUT6|Or that being said, I just want to go over this really quickly 'cause I know this wasn't chart that kind of brought up yesterday.
NEUT7|So today's candle starting to look pretty weeks is about 56 minutes left.
NEUT8|You know, not very great volume, so I would have liked to have seen a lot more volume and potentially a bigger green candle.
NEUT9|I had kind of outlined that I would have wanted to see this either go sideways or start to curl up, but it's kind of pulling back a little bit more.
NEUT10|Just kind of putting in a candle that I don't necessarily like to see, so.
NEUT11|Obviously now a couple of support levels to hold and not close below on the daily chart with for starters be this trend lined so it's going to need to have a Green Day tomorrow to hold this and then another line that I drew out was kind of like that $0.35 range.
BEAR12|So a close below those on the daily would turn me a little bit bearish on this, and then I could see potentially.
NEUT13|You know 29 and a half all the way down to like $0.28 being possible, so those are just some of my risk levels I'd be watching if this one does start to breakdown.
BEAR14|I know I've been a little bit more bullish on it in the last video, but you know, obviously the different candles starting to put in or making me feel a little bit different.
NEUT15|But again, you know I can totally be wrong.
NEUT16|Just kind of what I'm seeing.
BULL17|So if you pull up the hourly timeframe now for this one, so you'll see that after I had, it's nice move up.
BEAR18|It's now putting in lower highs.
BEAR19|It's putting in a couple of higher lows, but.
NEUT20|So it's kind of forming this wedge pattern.
BEAR21|It started to break down as you can see here.
NEUT22|So now the next level of support that I really want to see hold.
NEUT23|If it even gets there, you know if things turn around at the daily chart, shapes up a lot more than the hourly and things do start to turn around.
NEUT24|Obviously we might not test these levels, but the daily chart now really chart kind of similar levels of support that I'm watching, and just that big level being like the 35 or 33 1/2.
NEUT25|So the 335 mark.
NEUT26|So those are just some of the support levels I'd be watching on this one.
NEUT27|Obviously, to turn this one bullish like I still like the shape, right?
NEUT28|It's still in this channel.
BULL29|I drew out had a big run up.
BEAR30|It's still consolidating high and tight.
BULL31|So I still like the shape just because you know, even if it was to fall a little bit through this support, it wouldn't turn me bearish on this one immediately, but I would like to see a bit of a bounce here before I can really say I'm bullish.
NEUT32|At this point, I'm looking at it relatively neutral and having no position.
NEUT33|I'm just kind of looking and seeing right?
NEUT34|I'm gonna let the candles in the chart dictate what direction this is going to go.
NEUT35|I'm not going to try to time anything, I'm just going to see how this starts to play out.
NEUT36|Obviously if you're holding.
NEUT37|You know, make your own strategy right.
NEUT38|So we all kind of know what we should be doing.
NEUT39|Everyone knows that they should have their own strategy, so just kind of kind of make your own strategy and I'm just trying to outline some potential outcomes that I could see happening so this one still needs to develop a little bit more.
NEUT40|It looks like this.
NEUT41|It still needs a little bit more time potentially, but.
NEUT42|You know it's like high 30 threes to mid to high 33 levels of pretty important level to watch on the daily chart.
BULL43|I mean it would still look really healthy even if it kind of pulled back a little bit and then started to consolidate again just because this was such a big run up.
NEUT44|As long as it can stay relatively high and not pull all the way back, like if it only pulls back a little bit, you know I wouldn't turn bearish on this one, but I would obviously in the short term we want to start to bounce before I can become bullish on it.
NEUT45|So this video helps at all or you have any different ideas as to what you're seeing on the chart.
NEUT46|Go ahead and leave a comment down below if you want to see me.
NEUT47|"Chart anything else, leave a comment down below and thank you for watching everyone."""
