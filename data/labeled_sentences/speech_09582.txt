NEUT0|"""Today we're going to talk about the spanker with your SPL K and from first few it looks really strange."
NEUT1|Really big market cap, oh, $2.2 billion in sales and income, minus $800 million.
NEUT2|Interesting, I read all of the reports and all of the presentations and there absolutely boring all they have to know it is as they have two segments.
NEUT3|It is a cloud segment and platform segment and platform segment.
NEUT4|It is just the data analysis tool for big companies.
NEUT5|And here you can see customers it is zoom, Slack, NASDAQ, Airbus.
NEUT6|Salesforce, Google, Chevron, BMW, T-Mobile, Blizzard.
BEAR7|I think everything will be OK with this talk, but if we will see another bad earnings report they can fall down a little bit more.
NEUT8|And if we will see something like 120 on another pull down it can be really interesting.
NEUT9|Point to enter into the stalker.
NEUT10|Because in 90% of our cases it is not really interesting.
NEUT11|Kurt to kilo.
NEUT12|So companies like as this one.
BEAR13|But I don't really like it because they moved from software business to cloud business and you can see how the margin fall down from 90% in 2012 to 76% in 2020.
NEUT14|Also we can see how they consistently.
BEAR15|Lose money and now it is unreal.
BEAR16|UN minus $677 million LTM and they had they lose their shares from 95 million shares to 160,000,000 shares and not really comfortable for investors.
NEUT17|For my point of view here you can see 4K areas.
NEUT18|It is DevOps, compliance and security ID operations and platform.
NEUT19|With $81 billion, but in this segment are they have unreal amount of competition like Apple, Amazon, Google, Alibaba and as a big guy.
NEUT20|So for me it is not interesting to gamble right now because they can go up or down.
NEUT21|It is not interesting create now I will wait.
NEUT22|A better price is maybe 120.
NEUT23|Please write down your thoughts about us.
BULL24|Bunker maybe I missed something and it is a super great stock.
BULL25|"Thank you for watching bye bye."""
