NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, this is Linda Hill Group and today we're going to talk about a little bit about Disney stock in Netflix stock."
BEAR1|Both stocks looking compelling at this point, but one stock is separated itself.
NEUT2|Arrests away from the other stock and we like Netflix on learn long term view hold for the next three to five years.
NEUT3|Reason why we like Netflix is that is coming out with a lot of original content.
BULL4|It is not popping up on a debt and is having more is signing up more subscribers.
BULL5|To their business model an we're seeing sales increase.
NEUT6|As a sign of more people, more and more people up during this COVID-19 virus epidemic, everybody stay at home watching TV, enjoying time with the family.
NEUT7|So the reason why I don't like Disney Disney at this point is Disney just released that is signed anywhere from 12 million to $16 billion.
NEUT8|Dead deal take out 1612 million to $16 billion worth of debt.
NEUT9|To run today day-to-day operations.
NEUT10|And uh, anytime a company is doing that.
NEUT11|I say we have to be on the lookout and be very wary about any red flags popping up.
NEUT12|So these are some of the reasons why like Netflix over over Disney does.
BEAR13|He had just as as original content, but it seems like all Netflix content is outperforming Disney's and so far a lot of the Star Wars franchise episodes have not been performed as well as as people originally thought.
NEUT14|So let's get into Netflix and.
NEUT15|Let's make some trades happened this holding onto it for like three or five years, and if anybody bought the stock, maybe like two or three days ago, there is seen like a $50 share pop.
NEUT16|So.
NEUT17|That's why I'm telling you that's why I'm telling you that Netflix has a.
NEUT18|Has a Better Business model right now and a better outlook, so we're projecting out to be like a three to five years from now and 1000 thousands of dollars per share stock.
NEUT19|So let's see if my forecast is true.
NEUT20|So this hold on to the stock and let's keep investing.
NEUT21|"This is not a Hill group signing out."""
