NEUT0|"""He explained this via video chart on ticker symbol C Civ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well the downtrend here continues, although at least the price did hold above both of these areas of support which I talked about in the previous video.
NEUT5|So it's not like it was a train wreck of a day or anything like that, but certainly some updates need to be done.
NEUT6|Go ahead and actually just get rid of outline there.
NEUT7|Do some house cleaning.
NEUT8|Yes, that level still pertains, but from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines are real, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible, but the level here that like you said it was important IK, specially when I squeezed on the chart here right at that 2575 is Mark was I mean.
NEUT9|The power of charts crazy and I promise I will not move that green line.
NEUT10|You don't believe me?
NEUT11|That's fine.
NEUT12|I'm not offended.
NEUT13|You can just go back in the archive and watch the past videos.
NEUT14|But crazy to think that the price came down there and bounced literally right off that green line.
NEUT15|But the point here being that remains a very important level of support to keep an eye on moving forward.
NEUT16|So watch that 2575 Mark.
NEUT17|That's going to be an important area, but given the price was tested here, I do want to map out where the next level would be at just in case the price does go back there and breaks down through it and then after 2575 next level after that would be down there at the $25 mark.
NEUT18|So keep an eye on those couple levels from the support side of things.
NEUT19|Now in the event the price continues to bounce back upwards 'cause there's a little miniature bounce here, but the first key level of resistance in any sort of.
NEUT20|Continued balance going to be right there at $27.50 and then after 2750 next key level after that, that Purple line up there, the 50.
NEUT21|Moving average currently valued at $28.75.
NEUT22|So keep around these technical levels moving forward, but overall you have the down trend does continue but price didn't get a little bit of sideways action here, so we'll see if this is some sort of bottom forming.
NEUT23|But early next week I think is going to be very revealing.
NEUT24|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT26|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT27|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR32|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT35|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
