BEAR0|"""OK, so we need to talk about Jimmy as well because Jimmy made some ridiculous moves that people are so upset about as well."
BULL1|Not only looking at AMC, but you can see that it opened at $197.00, which is pretty good.
BEAR2|It did go to a high above $201.00 and then ended up decreasing quite a lot.
BEAR3|You know it closed at $181.75 and then the after hours market you could see this large drop that it did have here.
BEAR4|They dropped a significant amount and seeing that a lot of people got scared it did increase up to 190.
NEUT5|Eight and a lot of people were like, oh, you know what it's going to.
NEUT6|It's going to turn.
BULL7|It's going to make some new moves up, including me.
BEAR8|I was streaming and I seen that I was going to make some moves up, but it did decrease and then flattened out and stayed at that 150 mark, which is definitely something that's concerning for a lot of people.
NEUT9|But don't get too concerned.
BULL10|I do see this as a positive move.
NEUT11|"They're going to have something that skyrockets or just shorting this just like they're doing with AMC and all the other positions."""
