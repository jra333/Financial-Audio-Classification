BULL0|"""Does just hit another all time high but."
NEUT1|Why not play the trumpet?
NEUT2|Here is Microsoft.
NEUT3|You gotta get off with the trumpets.
NEUT4|Were killing him organ music for me.
NEUT5|I sold that thing at 1:59 and thought I was a genius.
NEUT6|Paul Stuart he got out of Microsoft too early after owning it for years.
NEUT7|No, we're not going to rub it in a little bit more, but our next guest says they or it.
BULL8|Microsoft is a real winner of 2020, as bringing Beth Kindig analyst Beth Good Morning.
NEUT9|Make your case on Microsoft software has lettuce out of the sell off in March and I think any portfolio without cloud software would be remiss.
NEUT10|Or you were missed not to have cloud software in your portfolio.
NEUT11|The common denominator there?
NEUT12|Is actually cloud infrastructure, which is where Microsoft leads.
NEUT13|So when you think about all these popular software as a service names that have led us out of this sell off, they're all funneling into cloud infrastructure.
NEUT14|Which is where Microsoft Azure sitting perfectly.
NEUT15|They are indeed I want to move on, talk about Roku.
BEAR16|That stock has doubled since it's low in March.
NEUT17|Are you bullish on Roku?
BULL18|I remain bullish on Roku.
NEUT19|You know it owns operating system.
NEUT20|It owns the ad exchange.
NEUT21|It opens the platform when you have that stack.
NEUT22|It's just a very powerful place to be, and we saw that recently with pellet, and I think you'll start to see more and more apps.
NEUT23|Choose Roku.
NEUT24|It remains a free ad supported option which is above and beyond any of the other options out there right now.
NEUT25|About 30 seconds.
NEUT26|How about Netflix Pandemic Lockdown winner for sure, but it's a very competitive market.
BEAR27|You know Netflix is above and beyond the leader, so it's going to be very, very hard for Disney or Apple to catch up.
NEUT28|In fact, I'm wondering, you know, the way that I look at this.
BEAR29|Disney is very weak right now.
BULL30|They have theme parks closed or they're going to be able to put the weight in to capture all of these viewers that are coming on line with OT.
NEUT31|Right now.
NEUT32|Netflix also has the market cornered 'cause they have a lot of content.
NEUT33|They spent $15 billion on content last year.
NEUT34|They're sitting on a pile of content while Hollywood is kind of, you know, slow and a lot of.
BEAR35|Other studios are not able to produce content, so yeah, Netflix is sitting for really good right now.
NEUT36|Short and to the point just how we like it.
NEUT37|Beth kindig.
