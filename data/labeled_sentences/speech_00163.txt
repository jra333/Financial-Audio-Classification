BULL0|"""Welcome back to fast money."
NEUT1|Check out shares of Palantir popping today and reports a Kathy Woods Ark.
NEUT2|Invest bought nearly half a million shares of the stock words next Gen ETF Palantir of more than 260% since its market debut at the end of September.
NEUT3|Jeff, what do you think of this one?
NEUT4|Yeah, so I understand buying it.
BULL5|If you look at 2021 I think revenues are supposed to grow over 30% an we're in this world where investors are still looking for growth.
NEUT6|I just think they're going to be looking for it outside of your usual suspects.
NEUT7|Your usual takter usual Fang names on here you have a company with a really high quality product.
BEAR8|The switching costs are high so it is very sticky.
NEUT9|I just think the question is what price you get in.
NEUT10|If you look at the chart it's failed at that 2829 level about three times, so I would use that level again as an indication of momentum.
BEAR11|Upward or downward, at least in the near term, and I think there are some stumbling blocks, say over the next 6 to 8 months you have the six month lockup expiring.
BEAR12|There is a risk of a reprioritization of some government budgets and that could affect their contract, so for me it's a long term buy.
NEUT13|I just think you might be able to get it at a lower price quickly beaks is this one of those in your top drawer.
NEUT14|Kind of stocks.
NEUT15|Leave it alone for a long time.
NEUT16|Revisited down the road.
NEUT17|Yeah, a top shelf stock absolutely, and I think you know, knowing knowing the investing genius of Cathy Wood, I think that's exactly what she's thinking as well.
NEUT18|So you know if you're going to buy this, understand why what the time frame is.
NEUT19|It's a long term by putting your top shelf, you're going to be happy with it.
NEUT20|Shepard Smith here.
