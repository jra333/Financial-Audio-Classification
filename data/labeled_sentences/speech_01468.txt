NEUT0|"""King, thanks for watching this quick video on Warren Buffett's company that it is well known Berkshire Hathaway."
NEUT1|So this is one of the let's say bolstered company in the US stock market is BRK and this is our chosen epic to be.
NEUT2|But there is even the A by generally both of them.
NEUT3|They have the same behavior.
NEUT4|They follow the same behavior.
NEUT5|So before investing in this talk I would like to inform you that please or always read the news around this company.
NEUT6|It's easy to find news about Warren Buffet.
NEUT7|About the East company.
NEUT8|So just Google it.
NEUT9|Go on Yahoo finance.
NEUT10|Read a lot about it.
NEUT11|That's a good news, is just invested in gold etc etc.
BULL12|So all those news they need to be gathered together and help to support the technical analysis as we are right now as we can see based on my technical analysis interpretation, the blue line shows the major thing that the market the market is moving up trend upward.
NEUT13|So the idea is to go long.
NEUT14|Following the major thing that is a bullish market before going along, perhaps it's better to just wait a little bit more with the end of this price retracement.
NEUT15|That can happen around the level two or five or two.
NEUT16|Then the problem is that actually it can just start right now to go along.
NEUT17|So if you it's too risky to me, it just based on technical analysis and on the available information is too risky to go longer and now.
NEUT18|But if you mean the idea is any way to go along to follow the majority and for a longer term investment, 218 a level.
NEUT19|Comes from these bypasses this match Lehman where it worked as a resident so the next resistance possible resistance level can be in 218 U.S. dollar and then if it's if it is this if this residence will be will be broken area is that next level.
NEUT20|Target level can be 223 this one and then go ahead if this one will be broken.
NEUT21|The next one can be even the one above that is 2 almost 2:30.
NEUT22|So as we are right now that is to follow the majority in the match attendees to go longer.
NEUT23|Saying that too yeah, desperate measures and then sending it.
NEUT24|I would like to show you guys this is my technical analysis interpretation without my technology interpretation.
NEUT25|We have this exponential moving average with the 70 length.
BULL26|And it worked very well to find these support level of this bottom of this new rarely, and perhaps this one around the level of two or five towards between 25 dot and it's gonna work as support for the new rarely and again this exponential moving average as well as the trend lines at most powerful and trustworthy tools in technical analysis.
NEUT27|That's over my side.
NEUT28|"Thanks bye."""
