BEAR0|"""Are profits bad?"
NEUT1|No.
NEUT2|Without them, the economy would wither and so it funds for your retirement.
NEUT3|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead.
BULL4|Will you get the insights you need to better navigate this turbulent world?
BEAR5|Profits get a bad rap, especially this election season.
NEUT6|Presidential candidate Joe Biden and his fellow Democrats want to tax them much more.
BEAR7|Profits are portrayed as coming at the expense of better wages for workers and lower prices for consumers.
NEUT8|They supposedly benefit the rich at the expense of the poor.
BEAR9|Critics cry people before profits in a free market.
NEUT10|This is nonsense.
NEUT11|Profits fuel, the economy.
NEUT12|They provide the money to start new businesses and expand existing ones.
NEUT13|Money is also needed to replace or maintain equipment, software and other items needed to run an enterprise.
NEUT14|Profits tell us how well a company is doing.
NEUT15|That obviously affects the entity stock price, so does the prospect of future profits over 100,000,000 people have 401K's in IR A's?
NEUT16|The better stocks do, the more money they will have for retirement.
NEUT17|Profits to producers.
NEUT18|What people desire an what they don't.
NEUT19|Similarly, investors can better gauge where they might best invest their funds.
NEUT20|What detractors don't grasp is that in a dynamic economy, capitalist constantly being destroyed as old entities and products fall by the wayside in 1993, for instance, the Boston Globe newspaper was sold to the New York Times for $1.1 billion thanks to the rise of the Internet.
BULL21|The paper was sold 20 years later for a pitiful $70 million, profits replaced destroyed capital and provide the wherewithal to create the new and better profits.
NEUT22|Come only after worker suppliers and lenders are paid.
BEAR23|Joe Biden wants to boost taxes on profits by 33% that shrinks resources available to maintain and grow businesses, and it damages the creation of new enterprises.
BEAR24|All this hurts job creation and the possibility of higher wages with opportunities the smothered those with the least are hurt the most.
NEUT25|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL26|"Thank you for listening to send in your comments and suggestions and I look forward to being with you soon again."""
