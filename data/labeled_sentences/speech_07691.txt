NEUT1|Wall Street often evaluates the riskiness of a particular security by the volatility of its quarterly or annual results and, and likewise, evaluates money managers by their volatility.
NEUT2|Measures their risk by volatility I should say, and I know you guys don't agree with that approach.
NEUT3|I wonder if you could give us some detail about how you come at the concept of risk, how you measure it?
NEUT4|Just Jenn general how you approach risk.
NEUT5|Yeah, we regard volatility is a measure risk to be nuts and the reason it's used.
NEUT6|Is because the people that are teaching.
NEUT7|Want to talk about risk and the truth is they don't know how to measure it in business.
NEUT8|I mean that would be part of our our course on how to value a business would also be.
NEUT9|How risky is the business and we think about that in terms of every business we buy.
NEUT10|An risk with us.
NEUT11|Is relates to well it relates to several possibilities.
NEUT12|One is the risk of permanent capital loss and then the other risk is that just an adequate return on the kind of capital we put in.
NEUT13|It does not relate to volatility at all.
BEAR14|Our See's candy business will lose money in pens on when Easter Falls, but it will lose money and two quarters of the four quarters of the year.
BULL15|So I had this huge volatility of earnings within the year.
NEUT16|It's one of the least risky businesses I know that you can find all kinds of wonderful businesses that have great volatility and results.
NEUT17|But it does not make them bad businesses and you can find some very they can find some terrible businesses that are very smooth.
NEUT18|I mean you have a business that did nothing you know and its results would not vary from quarter to quarter right?
NEUT19|And so it just doesn't make any sense.
NEUT20|To translate.
NEUT21|Volatility into into risk.
NEUT22|Anne.
NEUT23|Charlie, you want to add anything on that or.
NEUT24|It raises an interesting question which is how can a professor EOT.
NEUT25|That is so smart.
NEUT26|Come up with such silly ideas.
NEUT27|And spread them all over the country.
NEUT28|It is a.
NEUT29|These are.
NEUT30|It's a very interesting question.
NEUT31|If if all of us felt that.
BULL32|Charlie, yeah your dilly bars arrived.
BULL33|Oh good.
NEUT34|Yeah, you've heard of getting a second wind.
NEUT35|Thank you.
NEUT36|You tip tip him.
NEUT37|I didn't think our cracks were that funny, right, right?
NEUT38|But I've been waiting for this.
NEUT39|Craziness to pass for several decades now, I do think it's getting down to some, but it's not passing.
NEUT40|If somebody starts talking to you about beta.
NEUT41|"You know, zip up your pocketbook."""
