BEAR0|"""Shortfalls in the renminbi are agitating FX and equity markets after the August shock of the renminbi."
BEAR1|Sharp drop investors have their eyes on the People's Bank of China trying to understand one of the world's most unreadable central banks.
BULL2|China wants the renminbi to become a major currency.
BULL3|It won official reserve currency status from the International Monetary Fund that should increase its rise internationally.
NEUT4|Right now, it's only involved in about 2% of trades.
NEUT5|China has two currency rates, an offshore renminbi used internationally and effectively a proxy for fears about the Chinese economy and the onshore renminbi, which trades in a band dictated by a central bank daily rate.
BULL6|The central bank has been loosening this band.
NEUT7|The result?
BEAR8|A weaker currency that was expected, but the pace of the fall is a surprise far faster than traders expected.
BEAR9|At the same time, China has struggled to contain big stock market sell offs, triggering global concern about China's economy.
BEAR10|Falls in the remnant.
NEUT11|B may look insignificant, but in relative terms they are big and volatile.
BEAR12|The onshore offshore gap has widened.
BULL13|Not something likely to please the IMF, given that the aim is to unify the two.
NEUT14|The central bank is in transition from control to flexibility in its financial system.
NEUT15|Right now, the central bank is sticking to what it knows, and that's intervention using reserves to manage currency, controlling capital outflows and even suspending some foreign banks from certain Forex trading.
BEAR16|"Expect more of the same as China's transition continues volatility, pain and a falling currency."""
