NEUT0|"""But let's talk about the three vaccines that are tide with seven votes JNJ Nova VAX in the in the Sanofi Glaxo team up, and we've had all these teams on."
BULL1|I think the Sanofi Glaxo candidate has great possibilities 'cause both companies have excellent vaccine divisions.
NEUT2|Though they are late to the party.
NEUT3|Nova Vax is ultra high risk, Ultra high reward.
NEUT4|It's a total longshot that's trading like it already won.
BULL5|Why 'cause it got a $1.6 billion commitment from the president's operation Warp Speed initiative?
BEAR6|Well, it's disconcerting that people think that they are in the pole position.
NEUT7|Which leads me to my favorite Johnson Johnson.
NEUT8|I'm hearing nothing but good things about the trial, even is only now got into phase one.
NEUT9|More importantly, aside from Covid, JJ is the best pipeline of these drug companies.
BEAR10|Their vaccine could fail in the stock name go down.
NEUT11|That's how cheap this thing is.
NEUT12|I think it's by right here.
NEUT13|My Chapel.
BULL14|Trust us a big position in it.
NEUT15|There's not much to say about the others.
BULL16|I like regenerx on for its covid treatment, but I like it even more for its non covid drugs, including surprisingly strong oncology portfolio that no one's talking about.
NEUT17|As for Inovio, the handicappers spoken, they sell.
BULL18|The bottom line we will visit this race as we get closer to the finish line, but the bottom line if you want to make an informed wager or at least invest on the vaccine stocks, I think Astra Zeneca is the most promising formulation.
BULL19|However, J&J is the best stock because it's inexpensive and it's got so much else going if it turns out to be a loser in the COVID-19 vaccine race for a cure, or at least immunity.
