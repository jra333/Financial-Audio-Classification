NEUT0|"""Quick text question in here should I sell Disney stock and repurchase or keep the shares I already have?"
NEUT1|Well, you gotta wash rule situation there in the repurchase.
NEUT2|So explain with the wash rule.
NEUT3|Situation is.
NEUT4|Well, yeah, if there's.
NEUT5|If there's a loss on the Disney shares, you've gotta wash rule situation and and it sounds like we're trying to read between the lines here so we can't quite ask with the text.
NEUT6|But if there is a Lausanne you sell those shares of Disney and take a loss, you have to wait 30 days before you can purchase it again to get the loss in order.
NEUT7|Yes, in order to keep the loss and be able to claim that on your taxes and so look, you're betting on where Disney is going to go in the near term and you know again.
NEUT8|I think if Disney was a good company.
NEUT9|And you bought it as a long term investment.
NEUT10|You know who knows with markets the way they are now very erratic and if we get some good news, we get some good news.
NEUT11|As far as a vaccination or therapeutics or whatever it is, you know.
NEUT12|Hey, the market could take off again, so I am not inclined personally to sell a stock like Disney.
NEUT13|If it was a mutual fund and you could buy into a sister fund, it still captured loss.
NEUT14|I think that makes sense, but if you're talking about individual companies, I would not be inclined to do it when the markets are as volatile as they are.
NEUT15|And while we're talking about entertainment stocks.
NEUT16|Part of the provision that Bill is is that the relief does not come to companies that are not domiciled or paying taxes.
BEAR17|the United States and this is going to impact perhaps some of the cruise lines.
NEUT18|Carnival Holland, American Norwegian Cruise Lines because they pay 0 income tax, although they employ thousands of people you know, and also all the ancillary business that goes on in this country.
NEUT19|So this was a provision that was inserted in the bill for them not to get anything.
NEUT20|Now there are major part of you know of our economy.
NEUT21|"Although they don't pay any income taxes, so we're going to have to see how that plays out."""
