NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AM ZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Quite the eventful day on Amazon today in the uptrend continues to want to get some levels of support and resistance mapped out here as we continue to make her way through the week.
NEUT4|So when the newest areas of support what I would call the ideal owners, likely won't make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward.
NEUT5|That would be if the price could say up there above 3198.
NEUT6|Now.
NEUT7|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3198.
NEUT8|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, I mean if the price could stay above there, that would give the overall trend of good.
NEUT9|You know, solid, high or low and from a trend building perspective, that's what it's all about.
NEUT10|You just want to see those higher lows being put in.
NEUT11|Place and that's what the 3190 mark or excuse me.
NEUT12|3198 markers representing, but again, it's not like if the price falls below.
NEUT13|That means you know Amazon is just totally destroyed from a charting standpoint, but the next level of support that I would definitely consider more of an important level is down there around 3170.
NEUT14|Just because I'm not saying this is what's going to happen, but from an explanation standpoint.
BEAR15|But if the price were to come down there First off, that would imply that, well, yeah, that level of support already been broken, but then to break down below that second level, that would be a second break.
NEUT16|But then you look at where that price or where the price would begin, and I was on you have the price essentially right back to where it was when it was down around these lows.
NEUT17|Then not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT18|But price movements with genuine true strength, the price is not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT19|It's going to lease.
NEUT20|It makes some sort of form of progress forward.
NEUT21|So like I said from the quote unquote progress perspective, preferably the price staying above there.
NEUT22|But if not, you know that still gives it.
BULL23|Area to show some signs of progress down at that level of support now in terms of areas of resistance, first level resistance in the near term going to be right here at the 3225 mark.
BEAR24|That's been a pretty stubborn level.
BULL25|And then if the price can push up to 3225.
NEUT26|Next, key level that would then be up there around the 20 or 3250 Mark.
NEUT27|So keep an eye on those couple levels moving forward.
NEUT28|But All in all the trend continues on Amazon, so let's see how this one continues to play out over the next couple of days.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL32|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT38|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live.
