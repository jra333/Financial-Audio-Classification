BULL0|"""Ever Tising driven company beating expectations."
BEAR1|Earnings coming in at $0.09 per share versus $0.07 per share.
BEAR2|Estimated revenues 911 million in the quarter versus the 857 million estimated.
BULL3|I just want to take a look at the user growth #265 million daily active users also beating expectations by 9 million revenue guidance for the first quarter.
NEUT4|The company is saying they see between 720 and 740,000,000.
BEAR5|Above analysts consensus, the company's guidance on the bottom line does seem to be forecast less than expected on a key profitability metric, but that does seem to be tide to the company's investment in spotlight.
NEUT6|That's it's very new program, just launched in November to pay for user generated content.
NEUT7|They are paying about $1,000,000 a day, but I don't seem to be working.
NEUT8|The company announced that they have over 100,000,000 monthly active users for Spotlight in January.
BEAR9|Just doing digging in a little bit here on why this stock is down over 5%.
BEAR10|Despite those better than expected results, we're going through CEO Evan Spiegel's prepared remarks, and he says here we experienced a period of interruption to advertising demand in the first two weeks of January, as many brand advertisers pause campaigns during the period amid events at the US Capitol, and we started the quarter slower than we would have otherwise expected.
BEAR11|But guys, that really seems to be the only point of weakness here in this quarter, but that's likely the cause of that.
BEAR12|Stock trading lower now.
NEUT13|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT14|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
