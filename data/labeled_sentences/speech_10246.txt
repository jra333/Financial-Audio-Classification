BULL0|"""Beyond meat, up 10% premarket as the company had earnings last night."
NEUT1|They looked to grab some share now that meat supply in this country is being threatened, Jim asked the McDonald's CEO about that very phenomenon during an interview last week.
NEUT2|Take a listen.
NEUT3|I certainly expect that overtime that you will see plant based on the McDonald's menu.
NEUT4|I think for us the question is really about when and our system operates best at scale.
NEUT5|We don't do hobbies really well and so when we bring plant based on the menu, we need to be confident that there is a sufficient level of demand that really will allow it to stick on the menu, and so that's going to be a country by country decision.
NEUT6|I think there going to be some countries that are further along on that than others.
NEUT7|But I do expect that that we will have plant based on the menu is just a question of when I think the pandemic is speeding up.
NEUT8|A lot of things.
NEUT9|We're going plant based.
BEAR10|I think that the Tyson performance was so abysmal that recognition that the meat packing places somehow.
NEUT11|No matter how much they follow the CDC and the rules, they can't seem to stay clean.
NEUT12|I think beyond meat.
NEUT13|I know when I was at Costco, beyond meat is just a huge seller.
BEAR14|They've been hurt by food service, but there is a.
NEUT15|There's a groundswell.
NEUT16|It's not zoom with 300,000,000.
BEAR17|But I think that there are people who are getting appalled by what's happened at the meat Packers.
NEUT18|And the more more we read about it.
NEUT19|The more we think you know what beyond meat is, the way to be able to get protein but skip that thing called the industrial cow.
NEUT20|You've got Ethan Brown on tonight.
BULL21|Jim and I guess that means you are not heartened by Tyson resuming production in Waterloo this week.
BEAR22|Mom glad that they closed it, but look, I just think that there's something obviously wrong when you have factories that you're doing everything you can to keep this disease out.
NEUT23|Let's hope that this new Waterloo works, but I think these stories make you become, not necessarily vegetarian, but to think twice about beef.
NEUT24|And then you think twice about beef.
NEUT25|And then you try beyond.
NEUT26|You kind of realize it's very, very similar there.
NEUT27|Both protein sources.
NEUT28|The new Beyond sausages are much better in terms of the kind of ingredients that we used to get the price differential could be big.
NEUT29|At last, Ethan Brown may have that price differential where he's cheaper coming under the beef complex and this is it's really important ethos, not a hobby.
NEUT30|And I love Chris.
NEUT31|I think he runs a great chain.
NEUT32|I think the franchisees they just don't want it there.
NEUT33|Who wants another line?
NEUT34|Basically a line where you have to do something that's anti your core business.
NEUT35|But Ethan is Ethan Brown is.
NEUT36|He he's a missionary for 10 years.
BEAR37|He was he proselytized and I think it's hitting home.
NEUT38|I think it's a real trend.
NEUT39|I've impossible on last week.
BEAR40|Now they're GMO, which is something that obviously is a curse word among some.
NEUT41|But wow, this movements happening and you gotta get on the bus or get left it left behind.
NEUT42|But Jim, I think it's important to put it in some perspective.
NEUT43|I mean, you're still talking about a company and beyond meat that did, what?
BEAR44|$97 million in revenues mean these are still very small numbers growing off that base.
BULL45|Obviously at a very high rate.
NEUT46|But nothing compared to some of the bigger companies look.
NEUT47|It starts like that mean Nestle's picked it up because they think it's what I had.
BULL48|Nestle CEO on said look, this is a must in Europe.
NEUT49|So I mean it starts like this.
NEUT50|I don't think it it doesn't begin with a billion dollars but well this is not a blockbuster drug.
BULL51|"But watch this Trinity is very exciting for investors."""
