NEUT0|"""How about this more players."
NEUT1|We got PerkinElmer.
NEUT2|We featured them.
NEUT3|That's a $15 billion company that I think it was a baby Thermo Fisher.
NEUT4|I don't think they like that though.
BULL5|This stocks been a huge long term winner for us an you know they they now gotten entire suite of covid tests including ones that they claimed the most sensitive on the market.
NEUT6|PerkinElmer shot the lights out, reported last month, but the stock had a new high today and maybe now you gotta wait for a pullback.
NEUT7|Next up, could Dell now this one's a smaller, lesser known diagnosis?
NEUT8|Play 2 PCR tests to rapid antigen tests of the antigen test once again.
NEUT9|Are less accurate now.
NEUT10|Could else competing directly against Abbott Labs here.
NEUT11|But seeing as we still have a shortage of testing, competition really is not much of a problem.
BULL12|However, the stocks up 275% for the year and it's been a wild trader.
BEAR13|Why not let it cool down a little, especially after a very negative article that just appeared in the New York Times that question the efficacy of one of its rapid tests.
BEAR14|I didn't like that we've got Fluidigm.
NEUT15|That's a tiny ultra speculative life Sciences play with a 6 and change dollar stock Fluidigm as an extraction free spit test for kovid.
BEAR16|And while it may be less accurate than a true PCR test.
BULL17|At least you don't have to have a Q-tip stuck up your national so far post break while stocks up 95% for the year.
BEAR18|It's still a long way from its all time highs for over the summer.
NEUT19|This thing was briefly at $12.45 in August.
NEUT20|Food I'm.
NEUT21|I don't care if it's too risky for me, but if you want something to speculate on, it's worth looking into filing.
NEUT22|Please don't forget the commercial laboratories in the two of am LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics and they process so many of these tests.
NEUT23|These companies are practically printing money right now because they're pretty much drop.
BULL24|We've had thousands of people that's actually been up serious problem in terms of coping with the pandemic.
BULL25|They've been a bottleneck, but it's also great for LabCorp and Quest shareholders.
NEUT26|They're doing the best they can.
BULL27|Both stocks remain cheap lab Corps doing a fantastic job.
BULL28|By the way, getting a name as the nation's best personal test company where you do covid tests by Mail with incredibly fast turnarounds, I use them the bottom line with covid spiking in a very good chance that Joe Biden wins the White House Austrian more test friendly administration.
NEUT29|I bet the testing stocks have a lot more room to run.
