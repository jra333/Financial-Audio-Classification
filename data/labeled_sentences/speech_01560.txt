BEAR0|"""Or we'll bring our global growth rates down by about 0.1 percentage points, so that's true, but I think there's a big question on how long this is going to last."
NEUT1|Most analysts, yeah, you included our basis forecast, is that the virus gets under control in China by the end of March.
NEUT2|But as you see now, a lot of the uncertainty is outside of China.
NEUT3|How fast is this spreading?
NEUT4|And do those governments have the right measures in place to stop that and to contain those that virus?

NEUT8|But is that unexpected to have seen such a reaction, given that markets were so resilient for so long?
NEUT9|And is it all to do with the fact that we are seeing these cases spread outside of China?
NEUT10|I think it was always a risky basis to begin with at the start of the crisis.
NEUT11|Sort of.
BEAR12|Early February, I would say most analysts in most clients of ours and companies were expecting this to be a really confined to the first quarter of growth, and you expecting or really preparing for a rebound in the in the subsequent 3/4 of the year.

NEUT14|You know it's not slowing down.
NEUT15|I think the markets are really going to have to be a bit more comfortable with the fact that this is not going to go away very quickly and that's.
BEAR16|The reaction, I think it's always been pent up, but they were optimistic it will be over in 1/4, but looks like it's not likely.
