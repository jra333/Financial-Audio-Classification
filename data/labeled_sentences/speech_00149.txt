NEUT0|"""Time for unusual activity, Doc."
NEUT1|What do you got for us?
NEUT2|Well, Scott, as Jim said, it's become a verb.
NEUT3|Zoom ZM is the symbol.
BEAR4|Of course it is come way down from 500 all the way down to that low 300 level.
NEUT5|They raised about $1.75 billion.
NEUT6|I believe Scott the middle of last month and they did it at about that three forty 360 level.
BULL7|The stock has zoomed since then Scott and is back over 400 to about 414.
BULL8|We saw them coming in again, buying upside calls.
NEUT9|These calls expire next week at the 4:30 strike, so next week, February 12430.
NEUT10|I was already in zoom calls.
BULL11|I added to it on this buying which was even bigger than what we saw in the middle of last month.
BULL12|I think this one might be a blowout quarter form Scott and I just love the way the stocks performing today.
NEUT13|I want to talk to you about a few other names as well.
BULL14|Snap and Pinterest have both hit new all time highs today.
NEUT15|You've sold calls in SNAP in forward in Pinterest, talk to me, cash in cash, and in some nice games, OK?
NEUT16|Yeah, and the they are all three great companies.
NEUT17|I'm sure Jim and Joe and Liz would probably hold on to all three, but I had short term call Scott that were going to be expiring anyway in the case of SNAP.
BEAR18|It looked like it was going to be a bad move because the stock looked weak in the after hours has turned around and of course moved higher and I said I'm going to take that gift and cash out forward.
BEAR19|We just had multiple weeks worth of upside call buying took off the short term calls in there.
NEUT20|Yeah, during the day today as it pushed towards 12.
NEUT21|And Lastly Pinterest I can't say enough nice things about Pinterest.
BULL22|The traders of the options of Pinterest have been spot on.
NEUT23|It's like they have tomorrow's newspaper today.
BULL24|"I followed him in the stock, hit a new all time high like you said and the options just let me take that profit today, Scott."""
