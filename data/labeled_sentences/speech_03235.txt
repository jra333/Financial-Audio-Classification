NEUT14|For Disney in the portfolio of business is about as diverse as it gets.
NEUT15|When most people see a company that strictly makes movies and operates theme parks, it's actually a lot more complex for that.
BULL16|And then Disney is becoming King and expanding their reach by producing video games, creating apps and TV services, selling merchandise and clothing and even producing music.
BULL17|When we look at their goals for improving efficiency in their operations, Disney is set out to improve experiences at their theme parks by by improving facilities and infrastructure.
BULL18|In 2018 alone, they spent almost $29 million on improving their parks, resorts and other properties, according to their annual report.

BULL26|However, it should be noted that Disney's return is about on par with the overall average annual return.
NEUT27|Of the S&P 500.
NEUT28|We would be hard pressed to say that Mr. Heiser and his management team were not successful in making this an international powerhouse of a company.
BULL29|Considering how far Disney has expanded its reach of business and both geographical and portfolio terms, it shouldn't be surprised how successful they become.
BULL30|"Even as Disney continues to create exceptional gains in the stock market, we have to be aware of the fact that it would not be what it is today without the guidance of Mr Eisner."""
