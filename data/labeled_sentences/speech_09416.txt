NEUT0|"""What's a day without mentioning specs?"
NEUT1|So we want to get to a couple.
NEUT2|You know, Petco.
NEUT3|We're going to have the CEO coming on their pricing.
NEUT4|Don't forget, though, Touma Brava also price the $900 million back.
BEAR5|I heard it 13 times oversubscribed.
NEUT6|Can you imagine that 13 times?
NEUT7|It's not like they got a business model.
NEUT8|They got nothing.
NEUT9|They just there's Churchill.
NEUT10|I want to get to that in a minute.
NEUT11|But you know, that's where we stand right now where people are just willing to pay up.
NEUT12|Let me just get in now.
NEUT13|In this case, those guys are.
BULL14|Fairly well thought of, and so there is an expectation that they're going to do a good deal.
NEUT15|Speaking of deals, you saw Churchill.
NEUT16|We just brought that up.
NEUT17|That was the second largest back of all time in terms of what they raise.
NEUT18|Second, only to akmens.
NEUT19|Look at the move that that is made.
NEUT20|This is on that Bloomberg story from last week.
NEUT21|That said they were reportedly in talks with Lucid.
NEUT22|Remember, lucid is that EV maker out of Saudi Arabia, really, or at least backed by the Saudis making incredibly expensive cars.
NEUT23|I went through them here.
NEUT24|Of course I can't find it, but you know up to 150,000 if not more in terms of their costs.
NEUT25|They do charge more quickly.
NEUT26|Very much unclear though at this point, whether they're going to reach a deal that's kind of what I wanted to share here.
NEUT27|It's out of stock in the market that Michael Klein.
NEUT28|Andrew Liveris involved the Saudis.
NEUT29|He advised both of them and his other role is a longtime banker.
NEUT30|So yes, no doubt the relationships there.
NEUT31|But getting to a deal here where it would be a transaction through which they would use Churchill for to go public at lucid.
NEUT32|What I'm hearing is don't necessarily jump to conclusions at this point.
NEUT33|Based on that Bloomberg story from last week.
NEUT34|I'm going to continue to follow up and we'll see where that stands.
NEUT35|Yeah, it's not no way is it a done deal.
BEAR36|Stocks up usually huge.
NEUT37|That's why I mentioned it.
BULL38|The stock is up enormously.
NEUT39|Jim and I said to buy on Lightning round last night, 'cause I thought that story was spot on and loose.
NEUT40|Well, you know again, just because you're talking doesn't mean that you're going to get a deal done.
NEUT41|By the way they do have three cars coming to market, the air Grand Touring this summer, 131 thousand, the Air Touring late 2021 eighty 7000.
NEUT42|And the air pure.
NEUT43|At 69,000 early 2022, Carl, by the way, the case he deals out coral, we can tell people 1:15 as we told them, Cisco renegotiating a transaction that had it buying it originally at 70, but they didn't get the Chinese antitrust approval in a timely manner.
NEUT44|Now cost some 115.
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
