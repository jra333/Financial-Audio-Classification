NEUT0|"""Hello guys, in this video we're going to talk about Village Farms International, which is a cannabis company and its upside potential Village Farms International is one of the more interesting Smallcap cannabis companies on the market."
NEUT1|It has a market cap.
NEUT2|When I wrote that it had only 335,000,000 market cap and makes us more profit every year.
NEUT3|Even though the PE ratio is huge 190, they don't have a deck depth like most cannabis.
BULL4|Related companies, because it's one of the most cost effective growers on the market.
NEUT5|A big reason for that has to do with pure sun farms.
BULL6|A highly efficient cultivation operation in which Village Farms owns a majority stake.
NEUT7|Total cannabis cultivation costs more than zero point, $74.00 per gram.
BULL8|For its first fiscal year, a massive improvement from the 1.04 dollars per gram in quarter one, 2019 on July 8 Village Farms expanded to the Netherlands.
BULL9|Patterning with Dutch can grow.
BULL10|Touch can grow, expects to become one of the 10 licensed cannabis growers within the country.
NEUT11|Once once the Dutch government allowed the first legal recreation cannabis market in Europe.
BULL12|Dutch regulators have allowed a limited number of companies to cultivate cannabis and supply coffee shops in the country legally on 24 Julai 2020, brokerage Raymond James boosted the price target to outperform from 11 to $14.00 now.
NEUT13|Village Farms is trading at 5.96 dollars.
NEUT14|And this happened.
BULL15|It went up till 10.69 right now, but it was also 11 point $5.
NEUT16|So if we look at another chart, when I spotted another great price to buy, it was five point, $13.00.
NEUT17|And the market cap was low.
NEUT18|Uhm?
NEUT19|Also, then Raymond James boosted the price target from $14.00 to $20 and it had a price of five point $13.00 at the time of writing.
BEAR20|And the price went a little bit down.
NEUT21|And then.
NEUT22|Went up and the last by signal that I gave you was at 5.95, from which it went parabolic.
NEUT23|As you can see and the institutional ownership of this one more than 1000 workers company grew more than 30 million USD lately.
NEUT24|So let's look also at the prediction for this.
NEUT25|"It has a price target upside of 26.65%."""
