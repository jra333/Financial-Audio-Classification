BULL0|"""Welcome back to the bubble trading community."
NEUT1|Today we're going to be talking about Humble Inc. Ticker symbol TSNPD.
NEUT2|At the end of the month waiting for this to become humble ticker symbol.
BULL3|Ultimately, this was a great day for the stock closed up 12.6% with a $3.12 valuation.
NEUT4|Ultimately, the chairs are standing around 974 million, so pretty average for an OTC stock.
NEUT5|It is pink sheets current.
NEUT6|Ultimately the market cap is about $3.7 billion.
NEUT7|The community around this has become massive there.
NEUT8|A company that helps connect consumers to the actual merchants that they're selling.
NEUT9|If you look on their marketplace.
NEUT10|They have individual people that like you, get to see who you're buying from whose product.
NEUT11|So that's interesting thing.
NEUT12|Made a different people different proxy at little more of like the story of the actual artist that you're buying from.
NEUT13|So I like that.
NEUT14|That's pretty cool.
NEUT15|A lot of the hype on Twitter about this one.
BULL16|Definitely seeing.
NEUT17|Just a crazy amount like people really like this stock.
BULL18|Right now the charts looking OK.
BULL19|I might call that like a neutral, like a doje close 'cause it's right there in the middle, but it is green, so it's foolish volume has picked up from the last few days.
BULL20|This was higher than probably the last week, but almost last two weeks.
BULL21|Really, the highest it's been.
NEUT22|We could definitely if we can break above here, break above 350 and hold above there and close and start testing if we can break and hold above 4-5.
BULL23|Ultimately Test 6 and hold above there.
BULL24|Now we can retest the highs up there in the 772 range and ultimately if we can get some good partnerships, a lot more volume and just bullish sentiment around this, we could ultimately break that 772 and head towards $10.
NEUT25|That would be difficult to do, but with the right volume and partnerships announced with the ticker symbol, I think that all of this could happen.
NEUT26|Over the next 90 days.
NEUT27|The bear scenario would just be if the ticker symbol didn't happen properly, something bad got released and the market.
BEAR28|And this became bearish and people starting to sell off, but with a team like a solid project strong community.
NEUT29|So it seems like the bearish scenario will play out here.
NEUT30|Ultimately time will tell, so we'll need to keep an eye on it.
NEUT31|We will do an update on this once it breaks and holds about $5.
NEUT32|Ultimately, everything that we say here is just our opinions, not financial advice.
NEUT33|"Any investing are going to contact a certified financial advisor."""
