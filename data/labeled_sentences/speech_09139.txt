NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, you already know she would behave."
NEUT1|We bet with another one.
NEUT2|That's going here right into it.
NEUT3|You know why there's nobody time before we do that?
NEUT4|Let's get.
NEUT5|This video comes out so I can reach more people that they would be touching.
NEUT6|Bases on Bionano Genomics that sticker somewhere be NGO will basically be covering a brief summary.
NEUT7|Quick update.
NEUT8|Let you know.
NEUT9|Is it a buy or not and also covering where some good entry points will be exit points.
NEUT10|So let's check that out and also check out our support and resistance on being Geo.
NEUT11|So let's look at it guys.
NEUT12|We all we open, we open premarket about $8.70.
NEUT13|So we open at 890.
BEAR14|The high was 902, the low as 832 to 52 halves, 1569.
BEAR15|The 52 week low was $0.25.
BULL16|So we got a nice warm support around 8:50 on Bionano.
NEUT17|Around 8:50 would be a nice solid entry point to start getting in on this, and then if you see this name pulled all the way back to around $7.70, which we might not see what you want to be prepared, I grab some more and then if you see it want to pull all way down to around $6.90 I get some more shares and from there and we probably not see those prices but you want to be prepared and from there we ride this thing all the way back up soon as this thing get the 902 break.
NEUT18|902 real good 9.
NEUT19|9:05 this link of flight at 9:30 quick and wants to get a 9:30 I we can go to 970 even faster and now 70LB I less resistance that we have to breakthrough before we can reach $10.
NEUT20|After reaching 1002 we can fly quickly to a living so I exit point for Bionano where we get out of this set.
NEUT21|I actually put in before we want to ride this thing from the seven 50s.
NEUT22|The $8.00 range always yield back to 15.
NEUT23|We can sell that $15.
NEUT24|Once we select $15.00, if you believe in a company like the company, you can buy more shares.
NEUT25|Once they do at their reach realtime, he's gonna pull back again.
NEUT26|Reach 15, pull back down to around 10.
NEUT27|Maybe a living.
NEUT28|You could accumulate more shares, or you can still have your position at 15 and let their wrist open right?
NEUT29|So you know how we do.
NEUT30|I just want to give you a quick update.
BEAR31|Let you know risk rather be in Geo was a bad night and is most definitely is a by in this evening by zone.
NEUT32|Now you want to accumulate shares as it pulls back.
NEUT33|So these are like that.
NEUT34|Yeah, this video if you like these type of updates these type predictions out there.
NEUT35|Good stuff.
NEUT36|We post this type stuff every single day.
NEUT37|Consider joining the family and we got.
BULL38|"Yeah God bless."""
