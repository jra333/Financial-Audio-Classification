NEUT0|"""Hey fools, welcome we're here with a look at the markets 100 biggest companies, the Footsie 100."
BEAR1|It's been a tough go so far in 2014 for the Footsie since January 22nd.
BEAR2|The index is actually down 5% but Nate 2013 was a great year for the Footsie.
NEUT3|So what's going on?
BEAR4|Well, after going up about 15% last year, we've hit a bit of a stock truck with trouble spot here.
BEAR5|Most people are attributing attributing it to fears about emerging market growth slowing.
BEAR6|And that's probably a pretty good explanation, because emerging market indexes are getting hit even harder than we're seeing the Footsie 100.
NEUT7|So typically when we talk about emerging markets, we actually like to see companies that have exposure there.
NEUT8|Is this something changing?
NEUT9|Is that still what we want in companies?
NEUT10|Well, I think in the long term it is still something you want to see, especially these large companies, because they are so large it's hard for them to continue to grow and markets like the UK.
NEUT11|Just aren't going to provide a whole lot of growth for companies like Unilever, so it is the emerging market consumer that we would like to see these companies getting exposure to.
NEUT12|Unfortunately, the Footsie 100 is very concentrated in a handful of very large companies.
NEUT13|The five largest make up 25% of the market cap of the Footsie 100.
NEUT14|And if you look at where those companies are doing their business commodities.
NEUT15|That's oil, gas, iron or copper pulling stuff out of the ground.
NEUT16|Essentially that makes up a quarter of the Footsie 100 market cap 2 so with the fear that China is shifting its economy, that means it will demand fewer of these natural resources because they're not going to be wasting quote unquote so much money on highways and airports that they don't need just to spur growth.
NEUT17|And if they do shift, then that means all these countries.
BEAR18|And companies producing these raw materials are going to get hit, so that's a big fear, and that's part of why the Footsie 100 is getting hit.
NEUT19|Kind of hard.
NEUT20|OK, so now for the impossible question.
BEAR21|There's talk of market crash.
NEUT22|Maybe it's just a market sell off.
NEUT23|Where do you think the Footsies headed in 2014 and beyond?
NEUT24|Yes, the impossible question.
BULL25|In 2014, I don't have a clue beyond 2014 and I'm talking years I've I'm pretty confident in saying that we'll see the market continue to climb.
NEUT26|I just I don't see this as the end of all.
BULL27|Economic growth and development, and I think the Footsie 100 has companies within it that have access and to the growing markets as well as brands and reputations that will keep them participating even as economic growth shifts from developed markets and into emerging markets.
BULL28|Alright, so nice.
BULL29|Thanks for being here.
NEUT30|So that was look at the Footsie 100 tough start to 2014.
NEUT31|We're long term investors at The Motley Fool for keeping an eye on it, and we both say stay invested.
BULL32|"Thanks for watching full on."""
