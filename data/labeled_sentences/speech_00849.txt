NEUT0|"""Hey everybody crypto Mentor 99."
NEUT1|How you doing?
NEUT2|My parents taught me to be humble and victory.
BULL3|And gracious in defeat.
NEUT4|And the this morning defeat knocked on my front door.
BEAR5|I must tell you about my horrible trading day.
NEUT6|As my father would say, it's only money kid.
NEUT7|I woke up early.
NEUT8|I looked at ticker symbol AMP.
NEUT9|I can't even pronounce the company which is a good start on why not not to invest in a company that you can't pronounce.
BULL10|It was up like 800%.
NEUT11|And I said to myself, self, he gotta get in on the action.
BULL12|Whoa, yeah, I got in on the action alright going down.
NEUT13|So I don't even know what it opened at, but I was going to buy it like $11.87.
NEUT14|I had my finger on the buy order.
BEAR15|When I just say 10 dollars $11.87 Eleven 88 and it dropped like 950 like this I'm like Oh my glad I didn't buy that.
NEUT16|Then it went up, down, up, down.
NEUT17|I will be humble in victory and gracious in defeat.
NEUT18|This morning, defeat knocked on my door so I got in a $10.
BEAR19|$10.18 $10.18 and I had a marvelous exit at $8.00.
NEUT20|$8.27 Lou.
NEUT21|This was a dog.
NEUT22|Uhm, yeah.
NEUT23|That's why I'm not a professional day trader.
NEUT24|If you can't pronounce the name of a stock, it's a good indication you probably shouldn't invest in it.
NEUT25|Uhm again wanted to get into 1187.
NEUT26|Thought it was a great price.
BEAR27|Dropped to like 9 something.
NEUT28|Got in at 10:18.
NEUT29|Made the command decision to sell it 8.
NEUT30|$8.27 that is all.
BULL31|"Thank you."""
