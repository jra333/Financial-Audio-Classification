NEUT0|"""IBM let's do IBM 'cause it's going to be a slow grower, 110 billion PE 14 checkmarks."
NEUT1|I like them.
BEAR2|Yep profit margin a little bit below where we want it.
BULL3|Although I will say this in the last 12 months it's up over 10%.
BEAR4|I'm going to check my order number 3 revenue growth baby Alright Ready 81.7 down to 77 X guys look at the revenue it's done a lot in the last 20 years in last 10 years profit growth as I'm assuming is not doing well either.
NEUT5|Let's find out.
BULL6|So profit has gone from 13.2 down to 9 point 4X as well.
NEUT7|Now remember guys Pillar #5, which is number of shares outstanding without going down.
NEUT8|Check Mark 978 so little under a billion to 887 forty billion in current assets, 38 million current liabilities.
NEUT9|So barely a check mark them still there.
BULL10|They got a lot of debt free cash flow growth.
NEUT11|Are you ready?
NEUT12|13 point 112.913.
NEUT13|Eleven point.
NEUT14|311.8 so.
NEUT15|X again the average 12.4.
BEAR16|12.4 I'm going to pay 10 times that this is a losing company.
NEUT17|Actually, probably less than that, I really want to 8.
NEUT18|I don't know about 8 times that so called $100 billion.
NEUT19|Currently, at 113 billion pretty close guys.
BEAR20|The reason I'm doing such a small amount, you gotta really make your money 'cause everything shows this company is losing revenue and profit.
NEUT21|So if you have to assume that keeps going.
NEUT22|If there's not a story that you can sit there and see how it gets better than you gotta do that.
NEUT23|Let's see there.
NEUT24|Let's see their acquisitions.
NEUT25|They spent 31 billion acquisitions.
NEUT26|Yeah, they spend a lot of money in acquisitions guys.
NEUT27|What are they buying?
NEUT28|Freaking 2009.
NEUT29|Let's see they're doing revenue.
BEAR30|The last 12 months trailing 12 months revenue, it's still down from last year.
NEUT31|Jesus Christ.
NEUT32|How about their profit?
BEAR33|Profit is down also as as tough guys, this is where it is.
BEAR34|When you see a company losing this much revenue this much profit you got to pay as little as possible.
NEUT35|I mean maybe maybe 100, maybe 113 billion is too much, maybe 100 millions too much.
NEUT36|Maybe need to be at 80 billion?
NEUT37|I don't know.
NEUT38|But the good news is if you like their free cash flow, they're free.
NEUT39|They did spend a lot of money in the free cash flow to buy dividends back.
NEUT40|You know, I actually want to avoid IBM.
NEUT41|I think.
NEUT42|Look how much debt they have.
BEAR43|They have $130 billion in debt and their revenues going down their profits going down.
NEUT44|That's not a good scenario.
NEUT45|How do you?
NEUT46|How do you?
BEAR47|Your debt with your revenue profit going down like that.
NEUT48|"I'm actually going to say avoid IBM."""
