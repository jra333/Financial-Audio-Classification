NEUT0|"""Well, this is Brian Shannon from Alpha trends."
NEUT1|Blogspot today is Sunday, June 10th, 2007.
NEUT2|We're going to go ahead and take a look at some stocks for trading on the 11th.
NEUT3|We've got a pretty volatile market right now, and because of that, what I'm going to do something different today I'm going to show you some ideas that I'm looking at, but I'm not going to give any specifics as far as where I would buy them or the stop would be, etc.
NEUT4|I think you've got to be a better trader to trade in this market and to be able to outline the day in advance where you think you're going to put your stop just doesn't make sense to me.
NEUT5|Right in these conditions, so I think you've got to keep it shorter term and just manage risk will first look at shares of Art Technology Group.
BULL6|Simple AR TG can see this stock has broken past some resistance right in here that resistance is active support.
BULL7|It looks like we've got a rising 1020 and 50 day moving average.
NEUT8|You can make a case that this is a inverse head and shoulders pattern that would measured out to the height of that.
NEUT9|I'm not going to waste my time measuring that out because I'm going to wouldn't be in this that long.
NEUT10|However, you can see the significance of the resistance that was broken in here.
BULL11|Looks to me like this stock auto continue up maybe up towards about three and a quarter or so and I would say worst case you want to put it out below that level right there.
NEUT12|Next up will take a look at shares of the SCN which is a symbol for visual Sciences.
NEUT13|Same thing here.
BULL14|We've got a stock with a recent powerful breakout on big volume.
NEUT15|We gotta couple probably news events that occur with this big volume in their first found support along that 10.
NEUT16|Now it looks like it's.
NEUT17|Trying to find support along that 10 day 20 day rather moving average.
BEAR18|Look at a weekly time frame again, another significant breakout and pullback to that prior level of resistance.
BULL19|Looks like it ought to continue higher to me.
BEAR20|The only thing I'm concerned about here is the stock pulled.
BULL21|Rather than pulled out, but had such a strong day particularly late in the day Friday, so I'd look for a pullback to at least 1570 or so.
BULL22|Then look to buy some strength where you put a stop is entirely up to you, but I do think this stock continues to look good in Ottawa continue higher from here.
NEUT23|Last one will look at is nsit and this is Insight Enterprises.
NEUT24|Another stock that looks almost identical to our G except you know, multiply the share price by about 10.
NEUT25|I guess that it, and by that I mean we've got this.
NEUT26|Well, looks like a head and shoulders inverse head and shoulders pattern.
BULL27|Big volume breakout, low volume consolidation volume looks better on this one and it did actually NRG on their weekly time frame.
NEUT28|Maybe it goes up to test these highs up near 22 and three quarters.
BULL29|23 bucks a share, but you can see that it's had a nice pull back and broke past some short term resistance in here and that looks like it was tested late Friday as support.
NEUT30|So maybe you want to buy this one strength put a stop under here.
NEUT31|I don't know.
NEUT32|It's up to you again.
NEUT33|I think it's more.
NEUT34|Skilled trading in this environment once talk to look at on the short side is this Allscripts healthcare symbol MDRX you can see it's broken down here in a weekly time frame daily time frame.
BEAR35|We do have a declining 50 day moving average and on the shorter term time frame looks like it's probably going to get down below this 2445 or so.
BEAR36|Then maybe the momentum continues lower.
NEUT37|That's the look.
NEUT38|"Trading on Monday and I'll have another video after the close."""
