NEUT0|"""Alphabet's Google unit."
BULL1|An Facebook allegedly agreed to cooperate and assist one another on any investigation into online ad cooperation.
NEUT2|That's according to an unredacted version of a lawsuit filed by 10 states against Google.
NEUT3|Last week was reviewed by the Journal.
BEAR4|The lawsuit reportedly says the two companies knew their deal could result in an antitrust investigation, but a Google spokesperson tells CNBC quote the idea that this was a secret deal is just wrong.
NEUT5|Jim, we sort of got the sense that there would be this kind of.
BULL6|Our cooperation when Texas announced the suit last week.
NEUT7|Yeah, and I know Facebook is out there saying that what they did is certainly not equal to what the attorneys general are saying.
NEUT8|But when you look at the Google, I don't know if you guys got a chance to look at the Google react, their rebuttal to the government.
NEUT9|It's almost as if they're saying to the government.
NEUT10|Are you guys kidding me and my favorite line?
NEUT11|There's absolutely we did not.
NEUT12|We did not we tonight we deny we deny it, but we did not.
NEUT13|And then you get to this page and it says this is amazing.
NEUT14|David.
NEUT15|How revelatory as they deny then and then Google admits.
NEUT16|That it sometimes sells ads.
NEUT17|Google it denies any remaining allegations.
NEUT18|Well, there you go.
NEUT19|I mean there you go right?
NEUT20|Yeah, I don't know how to read it.
NEUT21|It's funny 'cause it's you know it's originate from Texas right after they sued to try to overturn the election.
NEUT22|But it's been joined by a number of states as you said, but the DOJ's complaint which is certainly one that we will continue to focus on did not contain this.
NEUT23|No allegation, right?
NEUT24|So I think that does bear mentioning because the DOJ spent a lot of time investigating here prior to initiating.
NEUT25|Well, I've done a lot of thinking about this against Alphabet, yes, But album what they need more than anything.
NEUT26|I'm not being facetious.
NEUT27|Is they needed Bing to be better?
NEUT28|They talk about being, they say, Bing offers consumers rewards for using Bing, I mean, but if Bing were stronger than I think the government's case would be much weaker.
NEUT29|Bing and Microsoft got a lot of money, but Bing doesn't really resonate with people.
NEUT30|David and I don't know when you sometimes you get tricked into using, but yeah, I don't really go to Bing do I?
NEUT31|Nobody did very few people and I think they might think of white Christmas Carol right now.
NEUT32|I still, but I'm still using it.
NEUT33|I'm still using Ask Jeeves, Carl.
NEUT34|Remember that when asked Jesus, yeah, yeah, see play.
BULL35|That was actually I see they got another deal this morning.
NEUT36|We're spending on Vimeo.
NEUT37|I mean that was an ISC business.
BULL38|Yeah, but they've created a great deal of value.
NEUT39|I kid when I talk about ask Jeeves, which became ask.com, which I don't know what it is now.
NEUT40|But the virtual dating that they've gotten so you know, there's a lot of virtual dating IAC.
BULL41|Yeah, yeah.
NEUT42|Yeah, very, very powerful.
NEUT43|They've they've done.
NEUT44|If you look back at this is their 11th spin.
NEUT45|I see spina Vimeo.
NEUT46|Yeah, 11th.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
