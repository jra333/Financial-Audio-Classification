NEUT0|"""So if you're a Disney shareholder, you might want to listen closely to this video, 'cause there was some news that just came out that will affect the stock in the short term and possibly even the long term."
NEUT1|Alright guys, so this is just a quick video on an update so if you're not aware AT&T did put in a bid for Time Warner Cable for somewhere around $85 billion a couple of years ago and it's been kind of going back and forth in court that never really went through up until today.
NEUT2|So that bid actually did get approved and ET will officially by Time Warner for $85 billion.
NEUT3|With no conditions.
NEUT4|So now you might be thinking if you're a Disney shareholder, why does this really matter?
NEUT5|Well, a few days ago there was an article that came out that said that Comcast is considering bidding for 21st Century Fox.
NEUT6|So right now, if you're not aware Disney has two things going for it.
NEUT7|It has its streaming platform coming out sometime in 2019 to compete directly head-to-head with Netflix.
NEUT8|And they also have their ongoing bid right now for 21st century.
NEUT9|Box so up until right now the only real bitter for this was Disney, but since the merger did go through for AT&T and Time Warner, Comcast will be putting a bid in now for 21st Century Fox.
BEAR10|So this of course makes it a lot harder now for Disney because they'll have to up their bid.
NEUT11|This might get into a bidding war, and Disney might not end up with 21st Century Fox, which in my opinion will be one of the biggest hits for this company because that was one of the big things going for it.
NEUT12|A lot of investors got into the stock recently because of that.
BEAR13|And if this doesn't go through, we could see some downward movement in Disney stock.
BULL14|So as of recording this video 21st Century Fox did have their stock shoot up over 5% here after hours and Disney stock did get hit around 2% after hours as well.
BEAR15|Also, if we look at Comcast stock, this is also down around 3%, because now this creates more competition for Comcast.
NEUT16|With the AT&T merger.
BULL17|So All in all, pretty much everyone except for 18 T is going to be benefiting from this.
NEUT18|Like we said, Disney and Comcast are not going to go into a bidding war.
NEUT19|Potentially for 21st Century Fox, if Comcast does come out with 21st Century Fox, I would personally not want to hold Disney long term, so as of recording this video I do not have any position in Disney.
NEUT20|I was considering opening a position, but I did see these rumors come out for a Comcast bid, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens because of Comcast.
BULL21|Does place a higher bid than Disney currently has.
BEAR22|You can almost certainly bet that Disney stock will drop again, but either way guys let me know down below if you're a Disney stock shareholder.
NEUT23|I want to make this quick update video 'cause I know a lot of people on this channel do invest in Disney, so you should be aware of this news that's going on.
NEUT24|You should be aware of the potential that Disney might not get 21st Century Fox.
BULL25|Thank you so much for watching.
BULL26|"Hope you enjoy this video and don't forget to invest positively."""
