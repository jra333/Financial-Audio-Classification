BULL0|"""Hi traders, it's Christine."
BULL1|Welcome back.
BULL2|We have Netflix here in our screen today and Netflix is up about .34% and we're looking at the YTD on daily timeframe an my technical tools.
NEUT3|I'm just using the simple moving average, the 20 to 250 moving average.
NEUT4|It's very simple.
NEUT5|This is the line right here and I used.
NEUT6|Candle stick for the chart.
NEUT7|It's a lot easier to see the price action and of course 85% of my technical analysis.
NEUT8|I used the P vote, let's focus forest on Netflix.
BEAR9|Here the Daily Daily Outlook based on YTV that we're trading at lower highs right here and post earning Q2 results.
NEUT10|Keep trading lower.
BULL11|Try to recapture the 200 day moving average but failed and keep creating lower right here and now.
NEUT12|The resistance at 300.
BEAR13|14 and last week resistance at 311, and now it's really, really struggling to hold a $300 line for today as it opened at 301.61 today and hire 302.88.
NEUT14|But now we see hovering in the last hour at 299.7 to 300.4.
NEUT15|This at like to analyze the daily P votes here.
NEUT16|This is that why TD, and this was the uptrend began at 233.
NEUT17|The 52 weeks low and this line the uptrend channel right here and we are on this candle right here at 300 cent for Netflix and here the 299 and then next to that would be this the 288.
NEUT18|And 297 because I always believe in the reset pattern when something changes.
NEUT19|So Netflix in the pay of daily in the picture of daily.
NEUT20|It's bearish bias.
NEUT21|Now switching to any.
NEUT22|Our lead time frame.
NEUT23|It's much bearish on this as we can see here, trading the load 200 day moving average and then the 20 and 50 converge as resistance.
NEUT24|Yesterday 304 highs were sold off and today the above 300 pop right here was sold off again and this today's session right here.
NEUT25|The three candles.
BEAR26|And as we can see, we're trending at lower highs.
NEUT27|So I'm looking at the puts for Netflix and routing under 295 low to up to 288 depending on the market.
NEUT28|But focusing on the P votes, as long as stay below 302.6 for me, I will stay short, but if it recut, recapture 302.6, then I have to cover my short for loss.
BEAR29|Right now I'm leaning bearish and for me to go long on Netflix.
NEUT30|I'd like it to recapture about this line about 304.6 this technical time frame that I'm showing to you is very short term because I usually use.
NEUT31|Option for all my videos tutorial here in YouTube.
BEAR32|That's my outlook for the week and for the next coming week I'm bearish and like again just have to put on nodes on the P vote below 304.
NEUT33|I like it short about 304.8 then maybe consider long at 211 to 315 as I want to remind.
NEUT34|Always be always flexible when key votes change.
NEUT35|You have to change your strategy too.
NEUT36|I hope you learn something from my video.
