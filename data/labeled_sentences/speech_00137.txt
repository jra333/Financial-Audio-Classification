BEAR0|"""Sorry folks, but we had that reversal."
NEUT1|We made price at the bottom here.
NEUT2|We took out half of this bar over there on the upside.
BULL3|Right now we got another breakout going back up.
BEAR4|We had that breakout where we bought it over here early in the day selling out at the top half our shortcoming.
BULL5|Out prices made once again.
NEUT6|The platform just keeps doing it over and over and over, and Apple's been strong on his little terms all day, but they sure make you a lot of money.
NEUT7|And the thing about it is that's alive trade.
NEUT8|I'm above 90.
NEUT9|That's the breakout I'm above half of that bar.
NEUT10|Here's where the breakout happened, right here we had a 369-1215 on the 15 half of the bar that mathematical line became support.
NEUT11|Half of the bar closing price.
NEUT12|There's that breakout and will be selling back at the top.
NEUT13|Another huge breakout long off of that bottom in that price action using this black box down here using the system that was designed for them using their brain functions.
NEUT14|And we got good directional movements, so when you're taking those moves in both directions, that money adds up at the end of the trading day, and that's how the MMT has a big paycheck, bigger than the private sector paychecks, because we know how to do this with this system.
NEUT15|And right now I've got that bid enastron ratio that's at 83 by 84 when that thing was down here that rip current ratio, then was at 73.
BULL16|I've gone up to 83, so when that trend ratio goes in the favor, that's when.
NEUT17|Mathematical prices are all populating right in here and it tells us exactly where the roll row is at.
NEUT18|It's on and highlighted blue in there.
BEAR19|So basically let's get back over to the brain if I start to fall here below 80 in that trend ratio, this move will get weak because the trend ratio is our mathematical ratio, not the bid and ask.
NEUT20|That's what we're trading when that gets weak, the top end of this move from here to there gets week.
NEUT21|We gotta stay above half the bar.
NEUT22|Otherwise, we're going to cash in the trade.
NEUT23|And we have to stay above 90 here for this to hold.
NEUT24|This was the price action down here at two 8658 you got in.
NEUT25|You make a dollar movement almost $2.00 right here in that move.
BULL26|That's a great long position.
NEUT27|That's what the price action is willing to give.
NEUT28|And here's the bid and ask right now we're going higher at 64.
NEUT29|There are the print 6567 shares that breakout it's holding.
NEUT30|Half of that bar once again.
BULL31|What a nice $2.00 move.
NEUT32|Right off of that low and this MF market maker platform tells him how to get in when you get in.
NEUT33|All the reasons why those train ratios are moving higher right here, it's at 92, so we're above 90 and we're getting that bigger breakout as we're going to take a look at where our exit is going to be right here and right now.
NEUT34|Right now it's exactly 12:37 PM Mark.
BEAR35|It's got about 23 minutes left were print down at 53 by 56.
NEUT36|Half of that bar just so happens to be two 8745 I gotta hold above two 8745 or I start locking in my profits bid and ask.
NEUT37|"52 by 56 nice trade."""
