NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back in the video today it is.
NEUT2|Your boy will now.
NEUT3|In this video I will be talking about color Star Technology ticker symbol CSCWK.
NEUT4|I'll be just doing a quick update.
NEUT5|Of the resistance level buying level, and there's also a new resistance level that you want to watch out for for whenever it comes down to are buying level.
NEUT6|OK so miss you guys.
NEUT7|Subscribe to publications and also smash that like Button.
NEUT8|It will only take you 2 seconds and it will help out the channel grow.
BULL9|So I really appreciate it.
NEUT10|Now resistance level.
NEUT11|236 still have this one your chart.
NEUT12|It has not reached up there yet.
NEUT13|It has not hit there yet.
NEUT14|OK and just so you know, once it does come up here, you might see some selling pressure so try not to get shares in here.
NEUT15|OK again that is 236.
NEUT16|Shorter term resistance level.
NEUT17|Is.
NEUT18|$1.68 so like up here.
NEUT19|$1.68 So this is for Monday.
NEUT20|Right here.
NEUT21|OK, so this right here is the resistance level for Monday.
NEUT22|OK, so whenever Monday opens watch out for this level because you could see some selling pressure.
BULL23|OK, now what I'm hoping for is it comes up to that level Monday.
NEUT24|It might be a little above it and then I want to break down and come to our buying level.
NEUT25|OK, now are buying level is also you could check out the two Discord links.
NEUT26|The first one is free options until may limit it.
NEUT27|I think 200 people and then the second one is a Weibull challenged $100 at 10K.
NEUT28|You can follow along with that as well.
NEUT29|Are buying level is $1.50 OK Now what I'm looking forward to $0.50 first just because it come down to hit this level.
NEUT30|You don't just want to buy, you want to wait to see buying pressure.
NEUT31|1st right wait for buying pressure and then once you see that buying pressure then you can get confirmation to enter.
NEUT32|But now since this is a shorter resistance level.
NEUT33|That is about 11 percent 12%.
NEUT34|So what I'll do is I'll probably get 100% of shares right here.
NEUT35|Right and then actually let me put my alert too while I'm here.
NEUT36|When?
NEUT37|Let me just make sure that it is.
BULL38|Yep so 150.
BULL39|OK, I got my alert.
NEUT40|So like I said once it comes out here, buying pressure confirmation and then you can get in right here.
NEUT41|There is around 12% so at 10% probably exit about 40% of the position.
BEAR42|OK 'cause that is a resistance level inclusive sell off and it could even sell off and breakthrough here and go lower.
NEUT43|So I will take profit here to make the play free.
NEUT44|But I will hold the 60% left just in case it breaks up here and it starts going higher to get up here.
NEUT45|OK, so the first profit target is 10% and the second one is.
NEUT46|I'll probably exit around 3040%, right?
NEUT47|I won't wait till it gets up there, so I'll probably exit between here.
NEUT48|Wait till it gets back up here.
NEUT49|Sells off, I'll buy that sell off again and then I'll hold to see price go over $3.
NEUT50|OK so that's all the ways I'm playing this stock.
BULL51|Hope you guys like this video.
