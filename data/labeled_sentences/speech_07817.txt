NEUT0|"""Mike Massey from Indianapolis."
NEUT1|I have really enjoyed reading your annual letters and your annual report and I've gone back and read all the older ones too.
BULL2|They are terrific.
NEUT3|I have also enjoyed reading the two books by Peter Lynch.
BULL4|And I see a lot of commonality's between the two of you.
NEUT5|The way you think and your philosophy, etc.
NEUT6|I'd certainly appreciate it if you'd make a few comments.
NEUT7|And what do you think of Peter Lynch?
NEUT8|The things he says in his two books and the advice that he gives to investors?
NEUT9|Well, I know, Peter.
NEUT10|I don't know him well, but I but we played bridge together in Omaha as a matter of fact, I I like him personally and obviously has an outstanding record and he has written those.
NEUT11|Two books which have been bestsellers about his investment philosophy.
NEUT12|I don't really have anything I'm not going to bring her on his we have there is a there's there's certainly.
NEUT13|A fair amount of overlap.
NEUT14|There's some difference.
NEUT15|Peter obviously likes to diversify a lot more than that.
NEUT16|I mean, he owns more stocks than the names of companies I can remember.
NEUT17|I mean but but that's Peter an I, you know, I. I've said in investing in the past that there's more than one way to get to heaven.
NEUT18|And then there there isn't a true religion in this.
NEUT19|But there are some very useful religions.
NEUT20|And Peter's got one, and I think we've got one that's useful too.
NEUT21|And there is a lot of overlap.
NEUT22|But I would not do as well if I tried to do it the way.
NEUT23|Peter does it, and he probably wouldn't do as well if he tried to do it exactly the way I do it.
NEUT24|I like him personally, very much.
NEUT25|"He's a high grade guy."""
