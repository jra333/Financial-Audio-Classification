NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very nice past couple days on Apple.
NEUT5|Pretty wild to think that not that long ago at all the prices all the way down here.
NEUT6|Now let's battle its way all the way back up to where it is right now.
NEUT7|So good sell and move the 1st update.
NEUT8|I'm going to do is actually just get this trend line extended.
NEUT9|It's still not necessarily relevant, but again, as I've mentioned in past videos, I'm still very curious about that level.
NEUT10|And we'll see if that trend line kambing, you know can come into play sooner than later, but more of the story there that still that overarching level of resistance as far as near term area of resistances are concerned, that next key battleground to watch very closely.
NEUT11|Going to be right up there at that level and see what is the value of that one.
NEUT12|Sixteen 85.
NEUT13|So one sixteen.
BULL14|85 again that near term resistance.
NEUT15|But if the price can break above there then that next key overarching level becomes more so that red line up there.
NEUT16|But one hurdle time.
NEUT17|So before we put too much focus on that overarching trend line.
NEUT18|Again that first key hurdle that will need to be cleared from the resistance side of things right there at one sixteen 85 as far as areas of support concern still do have this level down here, but it's kind of irrelevant right now in from a presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT19|'cause there's lines are we look.
NEUT20|So let's actually I'm going to adjust this level up to an hour.
NEUT21|I would consider the more.
NEUT22|I'm not going to do or die level, but certainly 115 would be a fantastic sign of power if the price can now start to hold above that moving forward and I'm not even saying the price will go down there and test it, but.
NEUT23|I mean, if the price were to come down there, test it and then it works way back upwards.
NEUT24|I mean think about what that would be giving you that would be giving you a nice set of those there.
NEUT25|You'd have lows right here.
NEUT26|You envision those as stair steps and there you go.
NEUT27|You have stair steps.
BULL28|Overall, making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT29|That's what it truly strong was going to.
BULL30|It's going to make progress forward and again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined right there around that 115 mark.
NEUT31|But overall, nice way to you know.
NEUT32|Past couple of days, the bounds continues.
NEUT33|Not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum moving forward, let's see what happens with it.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT36|But it will be me live.
NEUT37|Revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL38|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT39|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT40|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT45|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
