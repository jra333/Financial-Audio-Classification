BEAR0|"""Well, Facebook not quite delivering on all the excitement many investors were expecting today as the Dow finishes up its worst week of the year."
NEUT1|We've got somebody who says Facebook is actually more important to the markets than Greece right now.
NEUT2|Robert Multi with Singular Research joins us.
NEUT3|Now.
NEUT4|Robert is a pretty dramatic statement of we've seen Grease Week after week.
NEUT5|Gyrate the markets in the headlines globally have tentacles to reach out and color these markets red.
NEUT6|But why is Facebook more important than Greece?
NEUT7|Well, Liz, I changes the conversation from one of debt and depression to one of growth and wealth and more to come behind that.
NEUT8|And that's that's really key of the market psychology.
NEUT9|That said, I have to tell you I was smiling a lot more earlier today when the stock was at 45.
BEAR10|I really think that that Facebook and Wall Street particularly missed an opportunity today to really improve the psychology.
NEUT11|Here's why.
NEUT12|The insiders made the money today.
NEUT13|It didn't have to be that way.
NEUT14|They could have price this thing to make the new investors at the IPO richer to make them feel better.
NEUT15|What price would that would be much better for the market psychology and you know the other thing you know this is 3 billion shares, 2 1/2 billion shares.
NEUT16|It could have been better for Facebook today long term because there are very few examples of stocks that work that are priced at $100 billion.
NEUT17|Market cap trading 100 times earnings.
BULL18|But Facebook could have done better today with its subscribers.
NEUT19|They have 900,000,000.
NEUT20|That's a lot, but they could have given some of those subscribers its participation in the offering that would have priced it better.
NEUT21|What would have Robert been the appropriate price to achieve what you just talked about?
NEUT22|Wow, where they started 2528.
NEUT23|They should have let this thing work and let everybody make a good 2030% pop.
NEUT24|Even if it's Granny in Georgia making 100 shares.
NEUT25|Making $600.
NEUT26|My gosh the goodwill that creates for the market and for Facebook users far exceeds the chunk of change Bono made today or or Zuckerberg or the VCs.
BEAR27|So disappointing.
NEUT28|Robert, let's just roll it out a little further, 'cause we're running short on time when when do you think it reaches a more natural price or price that really reflects its value long term?
NEUT29|2520 this thing may be the best short out there on the market right now.
NEUT30|Everyone knows under writer saying it is a short right.
NEUT31|Everyone knows he I think it very well could be.
NEUT32|And you know, if I was in an individual investor right now and we don't have a position in Facebook, I would look at what's most hated out there.
NEUT33|The banks they're trading at 7 times earnings discounts to book value instead of what is absolutely loved when we're Speaking of a stock that's going to work, not about investor psychology, but about a stock that's going to work, David.
NEUT34|Very interesting stuff.
NEUT35|Robert.
BULL36|Bobby thank you very much.
NEUT37|Robert.
NEUT38|Appreciate it.
BULL39|Thanks a lot.
NEUT40|"Let's get to Robert Graves outbreak."""
