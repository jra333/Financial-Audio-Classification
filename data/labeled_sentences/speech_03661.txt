BEAR0|"""Hedge funds are attracting quite a fair bit of criticism of them."
NEUT1|For one very simple reason, and that's performance.
NEUT2|Hedge funds are paid money to protect the savings.
NEUT3|The investments of their investors and to grow them through picking stocks or picking the best investment of that time and generally being smarter than the wider market.
BEAR4|What we've seen in the last six months is actually the hedge fund industry as a whole has failed quite significantly so far, and we've had very, very correlated returns among very big name hedge fund managers.
NEUT5|Because very simply, they've been generally doing the same sort of thing, and so for that reason, some of their biggest investors are now asking what are hedge funds good for?
NEUT6|In the past you had these wealthy individuals who are more risk tolerant, and we're quite happy to sort of take large upswings and downswings, whereas now you have far more conservative public pension funds who are increasingly sensitive to both large upswings and downswings and also, more importantly, they're very sensitive to paying fees and they need to justify the fees that they're paying by showing performance, which a hedge fund industry hasn't been able to do so.
BEAR7|Some in the industry will say this is just a rough Patch.
BEAR8|This is a period of bad performance, but the industry is going to come through this.
NEUT9|The industries become far more sophisticated and structured for the tastes and interests of institutional investors like pension funds.
BEAR10|"But then there are those who say this is actually a complete washout."""
