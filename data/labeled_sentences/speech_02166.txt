NEUT0|"""Everyone Michael malice key here."
NEUT1|With stock which Academy thank you for joining me here today.
NEUT2|Now before we begin please hit like please hit subscribe at the bottom and just remember I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT3|I just love stocks and more in particular I love SOS and even with the public offering that was released this morning of $125 million, I still believe in SOS.
NEUT4|This is a direct offering to maximum group.
NEUT5|This is different than your typical public offering that's available to the entire marketplace because investment organization as buying all the show.
BULL6|This is a good thing for us OS.
NEUT7|Lot of companies do direct offerings to fund growth.
NEUT8|I mean it's done all the time.
BULL9|Offerings are not bad for necessarily growth saw from the recent press releases from SOS.
NEUT10|They are building one of the largest sass based crypto miner exchanges in the world.
NEUT11|OK, they're not only going to mine Bitcoin and ether, which is the smallest piece of the pie, but they're also going to fund the insurance aspect of it.
NEUT12|People want to know where their tokens are coming from.
NEUT13|They want to have a piece of mind that this is actually the original token and with the insurance aspect of SOS business, they're going to be able to provide him with that.
NEUT14|But remember, with all businesses, crawl, walk, run.
NEUT15|The reason why I believe that SOS needs the money is because they need to fund this growth.
NEUT16|Remember, a lot of companies institutional based organizations do not want to invest into Bitcoin miners in China, even though 50% more than 50% of the crypto mining happens in China.
BULL17|So my personal opinion is SOS is going to use these funds for future growth and expansion, not only to go ahead and continue to lay the building blocks to be the largest SAS based crypto miner.
NEUT18|And Digital asset exchange system in the world.
NEUT19|But they need the stepping stones to get there.
NEUT20|Remember, sundial remember all of those offerings and convertible debt matures and and everything of that nature that happened in January in February.
NEUT21|They have no debt.
NEUT22|They didn't need the cash flow.
BULL23|They had more than enough cash flow for the entire fiscal year.
BULL24|Now they have an abundance amount of cash flow that's going to enable them to grow and expand their business and bring them out of where they are currently at.
NEUT25|And in the situation that they're at, the cannabis industry is consolidating.
NEUT26|So Sundial is going to go ahead and.
NEUT27|An acquisition or merger or some sort of partnership that's going to future growth and expansion.
NEUT28|The same thing that SOS is doing.
BEAR29|The only reason that we're looking at this so bad guys is because of all the negative press on SOS.
NEUT30|If Culper if Hindenburg was not involved into any of this, we would not be in this scenario from an emotional intelligence standpoint.
NEUT31|My personal take on this is that they need this money to feud the future growth.
NEUT32|It's as simple as that, so that's my take on it now.
BULL33|I hope you like this video.
