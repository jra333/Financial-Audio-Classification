NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for March 9th, 2018 and Christina Bethany, investment analysts at exam.com and today will be looking at the British pound versus they use dollar or the daily chart."
BEAR1|Soap on Dollar made the step downwards yesterday, giving up most of the gains made since the beginning of the month.
BULL2|But as you can see the pullback wasn't strong enough to break.
NEUT3|These options.
BULL4|Line started more obviously in the beginning of November and now seems to be a reasonable support for the market.
BEAR5|Neither short term has the outlook is neutral to bearish because if you look at their site, other indexes marginally below its neutral threshold of 15 is flat acting has also deviated below its trigger line.
BEAR6|Ann is marginally below 0.
BEAR7|Why the fluke at the market price is those are not far below the 20 day moving average, so we see prices falling violating this upward pattern that people, not retracement levels from.
NEUT8|The applicant of one point 3038, one point 4344.
BULL9|I could provide some support.
BEAR10|The 50% female nochi of one point 3692 could be the first on the way and any drop below from here could trigger further downside pressures towards the 61.8% people natural.
NEUT11|One point 3538.
NEUT12|Which as you can see I was frequently congested in the past.
BEAR13|Uh, then lower than that in the worst scenario, the market could tumble to the 78.6% fibo Nachi of one point, 3321, which was also tested several times in the past.
BULL14|Both US support and resistance and instead pound all our managers to bounce up.
BEAR15|Resistance could come from the area between the 38.2% Fibonacci of one point 3847 and the 1.39 key level, where the 20 day and the 50 day moving average lines are currently located.
NEUT16|Then further above the market, if the market manages to close above this area, prices could be free to go towards the 23.6% people natural one point 4038 before they target the previous high of one point 4143 by opening the way towards the 1 1/2 year high of one point, 4344 turning now to the medium term picture of the outlook is neutral to bearish as well, 'cause prices are under the 50 day moving average, but.
BULL17|The distance is not significant, however, as long as long as the 50 day moving average holds above the 200 day moving average, there's still chances for the market to resume bullish sentiment.
NEUT18|So that's all from me.
BULL19|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
