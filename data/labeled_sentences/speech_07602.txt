BEAR0|"""One of the things that people wrote in a lot of people had questions about the banks about what's happening with the banks."
NEUT1|But you've changed with some of your investments over time.
NEUT2|Jason Goldberg writes in, he says, please ask more about his views on the bank stocks in general and on Wells Fargo in particular over the last two quarters.
NEUT3|He sold almost a quarter of his longstanding Wells Fargo stake, also in the fourth quarter.
BEAR4|He dumped a third of his Goldman stock, Goldman Sachs shares, although he still owns over $75 billion in bank equities.
NEUT5|So what do you think about banks?
NEUT6|Not necessarily the sell off today because you don't look at day by day.
NEUT7|Well, banking is a good business if you don't do dumb things on the asset side.
NEUT8|I mean basically.
NEUT9|It's a business that.
NEUT10|The banks we own earn between.
NEUT11|The commercial banks earn between 12%.
BULL12|And 16% or so.
NEUT13|Tangent net tangible assets.
NEUT14|That's a good business.
BULL15|It's a fantastic business against the long term bond.
NEUT16|You know, at 2% if you have a choice between a 2% instrument, the 12% instrument which was going to win over time.
NEUT17|So so if you ask me whether I think.
BEAR18|Banks are going to go down when they only earn 3 or 4% intangible assets.
NEUT19|I don't think that will happen.
NEUT20|Question is really whether they do something massively dumb.
NEUT21|I mean, which periodically a number of banks have done and I feel very good about the banks we own, are there.
BULL22|They're very attractive compared to most other securities.
NEUT23|I see an ad.
BULL24|Most of them are buying Bank of America is buying in a lot of stock every year, so our ownership of the Bank of America this year probably will go up 7 or 8% without spending a dime.
BULL25|I'd like to win any business, any good business where my ownership fixes up 7 or 8% every year without me spending any money and on top of that I get to do it and so it they're very.
BULL26|They're very attractive both against interest rates and against.
NEUT27|"Or against bonds and against other stocks in my view."""
