NEUT0|"""Well, there's a lot a lot of questions there."
BEAR1|I think that they are we having a spreading recession globally, I think it's already started in the UK, in Germany, in Hong Kong, China is cooled off dramatically, and although the US is largely a closed economy, it's not totally closed and it's not an island of prosperity to its own.
BEAR2|So there's going to be lagged effects here from the rest of the world on exports.
NEUT3|And you're seeing a manufacturing?
BEAR4|I mean industrial manufacturing, production in the United States is down at a 2% annual rate so far this year.
BEAR5|We saw the negative CapEx print on the second quarter and housing is really soft.
NEUT6|The new home sales today, even with lower interest rates housing is not going anywhere.
NEUT7|What's keeping the glue together?
NEUT8|You know, as you said, is the US consumer.
NEUT9|There's no doubt about it.
BEAR10|the US consumer is shown up but will continue to show up because the one statistic that has me a little unnerved is what's happening with real average weekly earnings over the payroll report year over year.
BEAR11|It's down.
BEAR12|2 + 0.8% were almost at stagnation on Unreal work based incomes and the question will be.
BEAR13|Well, the consumer adjust to that at a time when all these other components are already starting to a contract, so you know nothing here in the past couple of weeks or past couple of months has changed my view that we are either on track towards a classic NBR define recession or something very close to that.
BEAR14|That's going to widen the output gap cause deflationary pressures to come into the system.
BEAR15|And either way, no matter whether the Fed does 25 or 50 in the next meeting, the path is going to be toward zero over the next 12 months.
NEUT16|As far as I'm concerned.
NEUT17|And then on the earnings side Nancy, you mentioned this is all you know margin.
BEAR18|If it could compress margins hurt corporate confidence.
BEAR19|If you look at where the pain is today, it's pretty widespread.
BEAR20|But technology down 3% hardest hit group energy, consumer discretionary.
BEAR21|I mean which groups get downgraded the most in terms of earnings expectations as the trade war just gets worse and more prolonged.
BULL22|Yeah, so I mean, David brings up a good point about the consumer, but I actually think they're in great shape.
NEUT23|So the consumer discretionary stocks may actually be one of the places where you can hide.
NEUT24|Though you have to be selective.
BEAR25|"In this environment, I worry bout the chip stocks, the transportation stocks, and overall industrials, because if the slowdown gets worse and impacts the US more than those are the companies that are going to be most exposed to turn a classic China trade playbook mean it is."""
