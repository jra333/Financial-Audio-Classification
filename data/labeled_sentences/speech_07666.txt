BULL0|"""I'm Mark wreath here with Ron Gross in our stock of the day is Apple shares are only up half a percent today."
NEUT1|But the big news is that the company is put its iPhone 5S and 5C on sale.
NEUT2|They did.
NEUT3|I know, right?
NEUT4|Who knew her to think about it?
NEUT5|You haven't tell us what you have heard.
NEUT6|What are things looking like sales wise?
NEUT7|Well, I mean it's kind of a global circus out there, isn't it?
NEUT8|I mean, everybody's talking about it, including us.
BULL9|Yeah, all indications are that cells are very strong, especially for that gold Phone.
NEUT10|Seems to be all the rage they seem to have sold out already.
BULL11|Actually in stores, so all indications are things are strong.
NEUT12|I saw one analyst predicts 6,000,000 sells for this weekend alone.
BULL13|Wow, that's pretty high number, so we know that the iPhone is an important product for Apple.
NEUT14|How important is it that they get these new versions, right?
NEUT15|Well, it's of course important and you certainly don't want to have a release that doesn't meet expectations.
NEUT16|However, what I think is more important with these phones in particular, or what's inside the phone, specifically the technology.
NEUT17|Things like the 64 bit chip or the motion chip which will set up better technology down the road, whether it's phones or iPads or what have you.
BULL18|It's a very innovative company.
NEUT19|For a while there I think people thought maybe they were no longer innovative.
BULL20|I hope these phones bring that innovation tag back to Apple and I think will continue to see that in the future next year.
NEUT21|Two years.
NEUT22|Five years down the road.
NEUT23|I think this is the first step, right?
NEUT24|So as I'm buying my Golden iPhone today, should I also be buying shares of Apple?
NEUT25|We think you should.
NEUT26|We think conservatively the stock is worth at least $600.
BULL27|A share, which is about 25% upside from here.
NEUT28|That valuation doesn't require kind of lofty growth rates.
BULL29|It's easily attainable as long as you know there's no major flubs and we don't see those coming down the Pike.
NEUT30|China will help today is really the first day that Apple sells have gone on in China the same day as the US.
BULL31|That's exciting for company.
BULL32|We see good things down the road, 25% upside at least alright.
NEUT33|Well, for Ron Gross in The Motley Fool.
NEUT34|I'm Mark wreath, that's our stock of the day.
NEUT35|"Will see on Monday."""
