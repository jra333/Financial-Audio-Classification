NEUT0|"""OK, well welcome back to the YouTube channel."
NEUT1|Today we're talking about Neo.
NEUT2|I recently did just make a video about XP V as well, so I thought I might as well talk about Neo as well.
NEUT3|I'm going to clear the chart here and we can just see from just looking at the chart we can see this massive obvious line of support, so it's been touched now 123456 times.
BULL4|Five account the support has been touched about five times here and we can see that you know, that's obviously.
BULL5|A very strong, very strong indication of over support.
NEUT6|Sort of a support line.
BULL7|We can see that the price is coming near to this support line once again and we can see that the price is coming near to this level of support again.
NEUT8|So what we want to see is we want to see we want to see this.
NEUT9|This level being retested and bounced.
NEUT10|So you want to see this this price action to be bounced off, but you know if it breaks through not the end of the world.
BEAR11|But yeah, that could be a very very big signal of a bearish trend starting to form.
BULL12|Also, the emhs, the 200 day MA breaking through the 200 day MA once again.
NEUT13|Not is a Barry signal, so yeah, we will have to see what happens for the next few days.
NEUT14|If it does bounce off this 55.77 level then that you know that's that's a good thing.
NEUT15|That's a very good thing that it's not a bearish signal, but it is bullish.
BEAR16|But if it does continue to go down, it does look like a sort of bear trend here.
BEAR17|If it does continue to go down, breaking the EMA 280 may also breaking the 55.77 support.
NEUT18|Then yeah, we would.
BULL19|We would be able to.
BULL20|Be that we would be able to identify that as a bearish trend.
BULL21|Hope you guys enjoyed that very short video.
NEUT22|"If you did, please leave a like consider describing it is so you guys are."""
