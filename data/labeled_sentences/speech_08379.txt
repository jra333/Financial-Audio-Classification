BEAR0|"""Well, the economy in the US is still struggling to gain traction here with me."
NEUT1|Now is Phil Izzo from the Journal talk about the latest economic survey we have out today.
NEUT2|Filled with the survey finds.
NEUT3|Well, basically what the economists expect is sort of slow, steady growth, not really anything great.
BEAR4|About below 3% for the rest of this year, enough to bring down the unemployment rate.
NEUT5|Really, really, slowly makes how much we talk about bring down the employment rate they expect, we're.
BEAR6|At about 8.1% right now, but by the end of the year, they only expected to be down by about 2 about 7.9, so not really much.
NEUT7|I mean, apart of that too, is people coming back into the labor they expect people to start coming back into the labor force which will subdue the drop in the unemployment rate, but they do expect about little more than two million jobs we added over the next while you're speaking.
NEUT8|Let's get some of the major points from the survey up on screen here.
NEUT9|If we can.
NEUT10|Let's say there we go.
BEAR11|So GDP 2.2 to three percent 185 thousand jobs added per month.
BEAR12|16% chance of another recession 2012.
NEUT13|Not a pretty picture.
NEUT14|Let's bring in Jon Hilsenrath in Washington DC.
NEUT15|John good morning.
BULL16|Hey guys, good morning to you.
NEUT17|You know the piece of the survey that I think is most interesting is when we ask economists where they think 10 year Treasury yields are going to be those expectations for 10 year Treasury yields keep falling and falling and falling.
NEUT18|You know.
BULL19|A few months ago they thought they were going to be in excess of 4% within a couple of years.
NEUT20|Now they're well under.
BEAR21|Well under 4% and we're seeing 10 year Treasury yields fall as we speak back to where they were back in September.
NEUT22|You know, it's another example of very subdued inflation expectations and capital flooding into the US is all these worries about Europe and the rest of the world.
NEUT23|Just Mount John.
NEUT24|That's what he's going to say.
NEUT25|I mean, how much of this is really sort of worries about the US economy versus just worries about Europe?
NEUT26|I mean, we've seen the German 10 year yield.
BEAR27|Go down even further, the Swedish yield filled.
NEUT28|This morning I saw was at something like 1.48%.
NEUT29|How do you divide those two things up?
NEUT30|You know?
NEUT31|I think it's it's two factors.
NEUT32|One is just general risk aversion.
NEUT33|Investors are getting out of risky.
BEAR34|It's the risk off trade again and people flood into 10 year Treasurys when that happens, but the other is, you know there were worries a year ago earlier this year about commodity prices going way up and about of US inflation.
NEUT35|And it isn't showing up and people are pricing that risk out of the market again that you know they're just.
NEUT36|Are not inflation worries building in the United States all right?
BULL37|John, thank you, Phil.
NEUT38|Last word to you.
NEUT39|So what is this survey and things like the falling 10 year mean for the average guy or girl out there?
NEUT40|Well, the big concern is that there's a shock out there and then what the economists are telling us is that you know right now, the biggest risks are to the downside.
BEAR41|And there's a lot of potential pitfalls out there.
BEAR42|And if we see a lot more political and if we see continued political inaction, if we see a big shock from Europe, that type of thing that's going to have ripple effects for everyone.
NEUT43|So it's sort of it's talking about the fragility in the system and how easy we could go from 2% growth to something a lot worse when you anytime you're below 3% or below.
BEAR44|"Essentially trend growth, you're in a risky position because when you get hit with something at that level, there's a lot further to fall."""
