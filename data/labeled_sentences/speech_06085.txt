NEUT0|"""Hageland this via video chart on ticker symbol SAVE."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let it eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level, which they claim one make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up here above $18.70.
NEUT8|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 1870.
BULL9|I'm not saying the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage to stay above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power.
NEUT10|Moving forward as far as areas of support and concern for more so the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT11|That's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT12|The 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT14|So when it comes just gauging the health of the overall move, that right there is hard to find in quote unquote.
NEUT15|The overall move.
NEUT16|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls run full control.
NEUT17|Everything must visualize that.
NEUT18|That is what is being represented again.
BULL19|Yes and above 1870 would be great.
NEUT20|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bull is 100% owned.
NEUT21|The sharp as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT22|Next, key area to watch, which I think the price is currently knocking on the door of.
NEUT23|Yeah, right up here at 1950 you can see 1950 presented a problem several days ago, but once again knocking on that door if 1950 can then be broken.
NEUT24|Which is an old annotation.
NEUT25|Let's get that out of the way after 1950.
NEUT26|Next key level would be right up there on $20.25, but on all any angle you look at things Monster volume, fantastic price, movement, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT27|Let's see what happens.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT30|But it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL32|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT37|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
