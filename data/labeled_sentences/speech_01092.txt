NEUT0|"""Interview time."
NEUT1|So are you going to ask me questions or what?
NEUT2|SpaceX will launch into space, the most powerful rocket, the world's ever seen virtual reality headsets, will launch in great abundance and will quickly be relegated to the world of video games.
NEUT3|I think Volkswagen is going to ditch its diesels and go for electric engines.
NEUT4|Apple will not come out with the car in 2016, that's for sure.
NEUT5|2016 will be either the first or second hottest year on record.
NEUT6|2016 will be a longer than 2015.
NEUT7|Because it's a leap year.
NEUT8|Yoga pants are going to take over the world.
NEUT9|Peak yoga pant has not been reached yet.
NEUT10|Men will be wearing pink.
NEUT11|Men will be made fun of for wearing shorts in the office in the summer when it's 100 degrees out.
NEUT12|My prediction is that people will stop making predictions because they'll realize they don't usually actually come true.
NEUT13|How am I going to 2016?
NEUT14|I can't even predict one of having for lunch today.
NEUT15|It's a terrible question, totally pointless fool's game, but my prediction is right.
NEUT16|Tell me freeze over fat ladies made burst into song all the way around the world but the euro crisis will not be solved.
BULL17|I think the Fed will definitely be raising rates.
NEUT18|the Fed will raise rates.
NEUT19|I don't think that the Fed will raise interest rates substantially.
NEUT20|In 2016, Starbucks will introduce a new twist on their Pumpkin Spice Latte that will drown out all talk about rates or inflation.
NEUT21|Donald Trump will not be elected President Trump.
NEUT22|I don't think that Donald Trump will lose.
NEUT23|I don't think Donald Trump Donald Trump definitely will not.
NEUT24|Donald Trump will actually admit that it is a toupee.
NEUT25|Al Gore will not be elected president.
NEUT26|I think.
NEUT27|I think Hillary Clinton will be elected.
NEUT28|Hillary Clinton will be elected president.
NEUT29|Well, one thing is that we keep predicting that Hillary Clinton will be president, and then she keeps not becoming president.
NEUT30|But I'm not going to go so far out is to say that Hillary Clinton will not be present because only a fool at this point would say that Hillary Clinton is not going to be president.
BEAR31|So I'm generally pessimistic person.
BULL32|I'm guessing 2016 is going to look a little bit better than 2015.
BULL33|I feel very optimistic about next year.
NEUT34|How can you not be optimistic, right?
BEAR35|So deeply pessimistic.
NEUT36|I'd say neutral.
BULL37|I'd like to think that it's going to be a good year.
BULL38|Radiohead is going to put out a new album and it's going to be terrific.
BULL39|I'm sure everything will just work out just fine.
NEUT40|Should have done this research before.
NEUT41|This is going to tell us so much.
NEUT42|Ah.
NEUT43|The year of the monkey.
NEUT44|That's going to be a little volatile, but it's friendly.
NEUT45|"Yes, yes."""
