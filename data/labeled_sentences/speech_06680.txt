NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for October 26, 2017."
BEAR1|I'm referred by John Currency analyst at xm.com, and today we're gonna be looking at the Australian dollar versus the US dollar on the daily chart of the dollar is looking rather bearish at the moment we can see the stochastic oscillator has slipped deep into bearish territory territory below 50, but it is at over sold.
BULL2|Levels we can see potential bullish crossover of the percentage K line over the slow moving percentage D line.
NEUT3|If you have a quick look at the four hourly chart we can see.
BULL4|The recovery is already in place with stochastic oscillators, so there is some upside momentum at the moment, but.
NEUT5|It does.
BULL6|It's not very strong at the moment, although prices have recovered about their intraday low.
NEUT7|We can see the dollar just about 0.77 level at the moment and just about that one day moving average.
BULL8|If we do see further downside in the near term, support should come from the 61.8% fewer Nachi retracement of the leg from zero point.
NEUT9|7328 Two Zero point 8124.
BEAR10|From early September below that we have the 78.6% for one Archie which is just below the 0.75 level, a drop below 61.8% Fibonacci would significantly increase the downside momentum.
BULL11|But if the current intraday upside momentum does gather further pace, we could potentially see upside resistance coming at the 50% fib on Archie at around 0.7 Seven 25.
NEUT12|Above that we have the 28 point.
NEUT13|38.2% Fibonacci at Zero Point, 7820, followed by the 23.6% will not be at zero point.
BEAR14|7935 looking at the medium term picture, we can see the Mac the is trending downwards below 0 and is below the red signal line.
BULL15|So that's definitely strong.
NEUT16|Bearish signal.
BEAR17|Their prices are also well below the 50 day moving average, so although there may potentially be some upside in today momentum.
BEAR18|The medium medium term picture is still bearish, although looking at the much more longer term picture we can see that the 50 day moving average is still above the 200 day one and 200 day one is still rising.
NEUT19|That's it for me.
BULL20|"Thank you very much for watching and have a great day."""
