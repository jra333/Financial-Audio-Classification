NEUT0|"""Age playing this via video chart on ticker symbol MVIS."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a very eventful day on this one and a disappointing day because this thing was exploding on Wednesday and then today.
NEUT5|Not a whole lot of follow through, but it also makes it tricky from a presentation standpoint.
NEUT6|'cause there is a lot of perspective that goes into it.
BEAR7|Meaning if you were some sort of daytrader, flipper, scalp or whatever or self and you were buying up around there and your plan was to buy himself in 25 minutes will then from that angle the chart looks terrible.
BULL8|Now if you care bout things from the bigger picture point, if you understand from these highs there has been a larger pullback, but from the grand scheme of it all the price does still have the opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT9|How long term uptrends are constructed?
NEUT10|Just higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time and that's going to the viewpoint that I talk about things from.
NEUT11|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had more of a charter type mentality going into all this, and I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation.
NEUT12|Say let's say the price pulls back here a bit more.
NEUT13|And comes down to the $14.25 so price comes down here to 1425 behaves in that manner and then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT14|Now emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT15|What would you have?
NEUT16|Well, you have a set of those there.
NEUT17|You'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT18|You'd have Lowe's down there and if you envision each one of those stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT19|Well, from the big picture you would still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT20|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT21|That's what it truly strong was going to do.
BULL22|It's going to make progress.
NEUT23|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 1425.
NEUT24|Again, I understand.
NEUT25|If you're a day trader and you bought right there or you bought right there, then yeah, you don't really care about these stair steps.
NEUT26|But that's why I try to offer up a warning that I would be commenting on things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT27|So yet today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today, as in one day looking at multiple days as we're doing here.
BULL28|Or you can see the price does still have plenty of opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT29|So let's see if the price can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
