NEUT0|"""Discuss that preparate cut by the RBI."
NEUT1|Further.
NEUT2|I'm now joined by CIA President and Naushad Forbes.
NEUT3|Thank you Mr Forbes or taking out the time to join us on the show.
NEUT4|Your reaction to the 25 basis point cut rate cut.
NEUT5|So it's the 25 basis point is very welcome.
NEUT6|Indeed, you know the way in which inflation expectations workout the rate.
NEUT7|The actual rate cut is almost less important than the expectations of whether or not there's going to be a rate cut.
NEUT8|So my own way of handling it is to not expect a rate cut, and then if there is a rate cut as we had today, that's very welcome.
BULL9|And I think is a nice trigger for the economy going forward.
BULL10|I think it sustains the rate cuts that we've seen over the last year and a half.
BULL11|We now have almost a 2% rate cut over the last over the last 18 months, 20 months or so, and I think it will only enhance the performance of the economy going forward, right?
NEUT12|And we're about the cost of money.
BEAR13|Are you hopeful that going forward that will drop a significant bit, or even just by a margin?
NEUT14|It should.
NEUT15|I think the you know it will all depend on how well we perform on the inflation front.
NEUT16|We at present as as you know the government has set a target of 4% + -- 2% for inflation.
BULL17|We're currently tracking it around 5% and if this sustains over the next few months too, I think that will form the basis for a further modest rate cut.
NEUT18|But again I come back to my earlier point.
BEAR19|That I think the best way of dealing with this is to not expect a rate cut, because if you expect a rate cut and then don't get one, you know that causes problems for the economy.
NEUT20|If you don't expect a rate cut and then you do get one that only adds to the effectiveness and progress of the economy going forward.
NEUT21|So my suggestion is don't expect a rate cut and be happy when we get one.
NEUT22|Right, so now we've recently done a poll with 50 top CEOs to a question as to whether the high cost of money is impeding growth and around 34% of those polled, it said that it's not an issue.
NEUT23|Or what's your response in this finding?
NEUT24|And what does it tell us?
BEAR25|So you know the key issue that the economy has been facing over the last few years, I would say has been demand and I think in the last six months or so we've seen a significant pickup in demand as this demand is not affected so much.
NEUT26|Except for a few sectors like some of the larger big ticket consumer durables, so demand is not affected so much by the cost of money.
NEUT27|As such, we can see dim and pick up in a significant demand pick up in a sustained demand, pick up indeed without, without much change in the cost of money.
NEUT28|What needs to change though is the investment cycle going forward.
BEAR29|What's been really depressed over the last three or four years has been investment, especially private corporate investment.
BULL30|That for that to pick up going forward, we need first a significant sustained pickup in demand.
BULL31|We've got the beginnings of that now, and if that sustains for the next six months too, then we will start seeing, I think a robust pickup in investment as investment picks up then the cost of money becomes critical because a lower cost of finance then only enables so much more investment in capacity creation to happen in the economy, right?
NEUT32|Mr Forbes are going to leave it at that.
BULL33|Thank you so much for joining us on the show today.
BULL34|"It's always a pleasure speaking with you."""
