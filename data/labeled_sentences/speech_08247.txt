BULL0|"""We do, we think there's at least 20% upside in the stock driven by of course, films."
BULL1|While this film Toy Story 4 May have underperformed initial expectations, it's still the best debut of all of the four franchise of the four films in the franchise.
NEUT2|You know, not the sort of this tells you anything about Disney fundamentally, but anytime I see people so positive, I don't mean just the analyst community, but the general public so positive on a company.
NEUT3|You just wonder what are we all missing?
BEAR4|The same way everyone was so negative on Disney for the last four years now?
NEUT5|Everybody agrees it's it's the place to be.
NEUT6|I mean, what do you think are some possible stumbling blocks here?
NEUT7|What has to go right for them to justify that kind of price that you're talking about?
NEUT8|It?
BULL9|Totally agree.
BULL10|Totally agree.
NEUT11|It is a little disconcerting that everybody loves it, but there really is a lot to like at the moment.
NEUT12|They have the theme parks are on fire.
NEUT13|Given the two lands, the one that just opened in California, the Star Wars related lands and then in Florida, opening in late August.
NEUT14|And this is a really big deal.
BULL15|I mean pricing has gone up a lot there they're doing.
BULL16|They're trying to control attendance through pricing, so they've had a lot of pricing power in the parks, and there's been incredible Visitation.
BULL17|And of course there will be a new hotel and then their IP, meaning their movies have been phenomenal.
NEUT18|And really, the big event that everybody is waiting for is the launch of Disney Plus in November, and I think there's a lot of optimism given their content given the push that they're putting behind it.
NEUT19|And I mean, even like, let's take Toy Story Four, there will be character offshoots in original content on Disney Plus.
NEUT20|So there's just a lot going on.
NEUT21|What, what, if anything, Jessica is.
NEUT22|Is the worry spot for Disney Disney is it?
NEUT23|Is it Bob Iger's eventual departure.
NEUT24|I mean, I can't think of anything else, can you?
NEUT25|Yeah, yes, there are two things you hit the nail on the head with.
NEUT26|The first.
NEUT27|Who is the successor.
BULL28|This is an amazing company with incredible management, incredible qualities, incredible brands and assets.
NEUT29|Who's going to take over?
NEUT30|Will Bob leave Bob Eiger legally stay for another term?
NEUT31|Will see we just don't know and that of course is a concern longer term.
NEUT32|And then what happens with China?
NEUT33|Are there any ramifications at all given the ownership of the Chinese in the Disney?
NEUT34|Park it's it's hard to see a negative impact with Chinese.
NEUT35|Consumer, of course, is important, but the Chinese on the bulk of that park, and so they should be in decent condition.
NEUT36|But yes, there are some concerns, of course.
NEUT37|The economy is always a concern.
BULL38|We seem to be fairly healthy right now, and I can say that the advertising market, the up front market is wrapping up and it was extremely robust.
BULL39|"So that's another positive sign."""
