NEUT0|"""Hey guys, welcome to tips on trading and today I'm going to go over a trade we took just a few days ago on our live stream."
BULL1|It is for Disney DIS and as you can see right now it's already up 25% today on call.
NEUT2|And we bought it at 183 or 1.83 cost bases.
BEAR3|And so our returns in total have been closed about 28% to 30% with this $51.00 profit.
NEUT4|And that's more than enough because I usually go for 2025% minimum return per position that we have.
NEUT5|So this makes me really happy or content that not just me, but all our subscribers made this money and it was again based on our strategy that has been backtested literally 20 years and thousands of charts.
NEUT6|With the right risk management so.
BULL7|Pretty good return.
BULL8|Really happy with it.
NEUT9|So that's it, and that's what I wanted to kind of discuss with you.
