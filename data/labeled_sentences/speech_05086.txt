NEUT0|"""Netflix, I've been kind of tempted to get into this thing today."
BULL1|It's doing well.
BULL2|It's up two and a half percent.
BULL3|It's rallied three days.
NEUT4|I can't remember the last time we saw a three day rally.
NEUT5|I guess back in July.
NEUT6|So it's been a couple of months.
BEAR7|This thing is just continued to go down.
NEUT8|It's broken out of this bearish wedge, so that's something to get get interested in the stop loss.
NEUT9|The risk reward on the trade.
BULL10|Still pretty favorable.
BEAR11|I think if it goes back below 286, you should probably get out of it.
NEUT12|I didn't buy it.
NEUT13|I opted for square instead.
NEUT14|I wanted to play the bouncing that instead.
BULL15|So far so good.
BULL16|But yeah, I mean it's starting to look a little bit more positive that's breaking above the 20 day moving average.
NEUT17|Bigger, bigger picture here you can see the bullish Wedge there did break out of it.
NEUT18|It has a long term trendline that you go way back to like 2016.
BULL19|It did break it so there could be some resistance there at around like the 310 area.
NEUT20|If it continues to move higher.
BULL21|Thanks for watching.
