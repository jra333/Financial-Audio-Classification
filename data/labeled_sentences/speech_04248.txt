NEUT0|"""A flat tax is simple and cuts taxes for everyone."
NEUT1|Why can't we just do it?
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to help navigate these turbulent times.
NEUT3|Taxes were a big issue in the first presidential debate, but neither candidate even mentioned an idea that would radically simplify the current system and give everyone a tax cut as well.
NEUT4|It's called the flat tax it operates in over 30 countries in Hong Kong with considerable success.
NEUT5|The idea is simple, throw out the entire federal income tax code and replace it with a single rate of only 17%, with generous exemptions for individuals and dependants.
NEUT6|That's right, the whole federal income tax code, which combined with all the attendant rules and regulations, comes to more than 10 million words.
NEUT7|The whole thing would be junked.
NEUT8|As a result, a family of four, for example, would pay no federal income tax on their first $52,800 of salary and only $0.17 in the dollar.
NEUT9|Above that level, there'd be no tax on their savings.
BEAR10|Everyone's tax bill would come down.
NEUT11|You could literally do your income tax on a sheet of paper or with a few keystrokes on your computer.
NEUT12|The current code is a cesspool of complexity and corruption.
NEUT13|A huge amount of the lobbying in the swamp of Washington revolves around taxes.
BEAR14|We have the ugly spectacle of special interests vying for special breaks that are buried in the code and shrouded with incomprehensible language coping with this code involves immense amounts of time and money.
NEUT15|The IRS estimates we spend 6 billion hours a year filling out tax forms.
NEUT16|Experts tell us the American people spend over $300 billion a year complying with this monstrosity.
NEUT17|This is why the flat tax is a moral issue.
NEUT18|Add up what we've expended in time and money over the last 20 years.
NEUT19|Over 100 billion hours and literally trillions of dollars.
NEUT20|And imagine if those enormous resources have been applied to creating new products and services and new medical devices, new cures for diseases.
NEUT21|How much better life would be for all of us today?
NEUT22|The tax code we have today is beyond redemption and magazine.
NEUT23|Once conducted an experiment at as 46 expert tax prepares.
NEUT24|People consider the best in the field to prepare the tax return for a hypothetical family an you can guess what happened No2.
NEUT25|Tax preparers could agree on what the family owed Uncle Sam remember this from people who make their living preparing returns.
BULL26|The flat tax would be especially helpful in enabling us to get a faster recovery from the economic damage done to us by the Corona virus.
NEUT27|The sooner the better.
