NEUT0|"""In this video, I'll be doing a price update on refinance or simply known as brief as well as my price prediction moving forward."
NEUT1|If it's your first time here, welcome post new videos every single day except when I have an off day which doesn't happen too often.
NEUT2|I'm currently on a 7 day streak.
NEUT3|I make videos on stocks and other cryptocurrencies, so make sure hit the subscribe button for that to my regular viewers.
BULL4|Welcome back.
BULL5|Thanks for being here.
NEUT6|With that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT7|Let's talk money.
NEUT8|As always, not a financial advisor.
NEUT9|You should always do your own due diligence, but in my opinion, reef is the great price right now.
BEAR10|At the time of recording its training around 3.5, four cents, which is a significant dip from its all time high of $0.05 that are reached on February 13, 2021.
NEUT11|Famous quote that I like to be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.
NEUT12|In other words, be cautious when everyone is loading up on shares.
BEAR13|Think of the price will rise all the way to Infinity and be aggressive enough to buy the dip when everyone else is selling off thinking the price will go down all the way to 0, many will see Reef as a depreciating asset.
NEUT14|But I see as a 30% discount sell the fundamentals of reef.
NEUT15|Haven't changed at all, it's just a regular market cycle.
NEUT16|I'm expecting to come back from Reef.
NEUT17|If you don't already follow their Twitter account, he should.
NEUT18|I'll link it in the description.
NEUT19|Just a few days ago on March 8th, according to one other tweets, refinance as the second most search coin on Coinmarketcap.
NEUT20|This is what I really love about reef according to Coinmarketcap.
NEUT21|Reef has a market cap who bought $406 million and only ranks number 111th in terms of market cap, but is already one of the most search coins.
NEUT22|This one has a ton of room to run.
BULL23|Invested in a more established crypto coin like Bitcoin is a safer investment, no doubt.
NEUT24|Bitcoin is practically the face of cryptocurrencies, and so pretty much a for sure thing that will keep appreciating over the long run, but its growth is limited.
BULL25|One of these outcomes, like reef hits it will easily outperform bacon by miles.
NEUT26|So being second on the search bar means there's definitely a lot of prospective investors paying attention to reef, though most likely jump in later when Reef is at 10 cents $0.20.
NEUT27|Basically, after they get FOMO.
BEAR28|I'm sure they're also concerned with the recent dip.
NEUT29|I'll share with you a strategy that I like.
NEUT30|If you're not super confident but have a feeling that a project has a ton of potential.
NEUT31|What I personally like to do is post small amount that won't even make a difference in my life.
NEUT32|Put a hundred 200 whatever you feel comfortable with just starting position.
BULL33|You might feel more comfortable putting more money later and increasing your position.
NEUT34|That's totally fine.
NEUT35|Like anything else, the hardest part is just starting.
NEUT36|Binary right now is a much lower risk than it was last month.
BULL37|History has always shown us that it's possible for wreath reach 5 cents.
NEUT38|Think it's likely that will happen again in the next month or two just right.
NEUT39|There.
BULL40|That's already in almost 50% increase from today's prize will take you a cool for years for you to get that kind of return.
NEUT41|Investing in a traditional S&P 500 index fund.
NEUT42|My prediction's being really conservative if re takes off, you can easily hit $0.30 sometime in 2021.
NEUT43|"Fifty cents is also definitely not other question."""
