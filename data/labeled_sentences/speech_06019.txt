NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris."
NEUT1|Take a look at the Silver Weekly chart.
BULL2|You can see that we have formed a bit of a neutral candle stick here.
NEUT3|The hammer if you will, and it to me it looks like a market that truly wants to go higher.
BEAR4|But there's a lot of indecision out there and rightfully so.
BEAR5|I mean, this is a scenario where you have to wonder whether there's industrial demand or will just simple U.S. dollar weakness push this market higher.
BULL6|You should keep in mind though, that central banks around the world are loosening monetary policy anyway, so server is probably going to rally based upon the hard asset demand.
NEUT7|30 I think it's.
BEAR8|Chase again eventually 28 obvious resistance.
BEAR9|"If we break down below 25, you have to kind of question things for awhile, but ultimately I do think that this is a scenario where the market goes looking higher."""
