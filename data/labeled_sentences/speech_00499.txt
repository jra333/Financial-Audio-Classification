NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Excel on is range between $1.66 per share and $46.59 per share."
NEUT1|How are those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying a dollar in $0.66 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $1.66 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Fair enough, but what about this high end paying 4659 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings.
NEUT5|So price of 4659 per share represents the fractional payment we pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT6|Now this is a conservative way to value the company is different from calculating its price to earnings ratio.

NEUT17|I want to look at the products that they sell.
NEUT18|If they sell any utilities, do they sell those?
NEUT19|What are their prices?
NEUT20|Who's a CEO?
