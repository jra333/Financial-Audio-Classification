BULL0|"""Hi guys and welcome back for my daily technical analysis."
NEUT1|Do they have chosen Amazon.com?
NEUT2|And as you can see here, if chosen net weekly chart so every candle is everything one.
NEUT3|So in the upper section of the chart we see the naked price with the horizontal support and oblique support and resistances.
BULL4|While beneath I've brought this yes to advance.
NEUT5|Now what's happening in April 2020 is that we've experienced the long white candle breaking above the X horizontal resistance which is now horizontal support.
NEUT6|Now in terms of.
NEUT7|Price projection we have a 2700 points which comes from the difference between the horizontal resistance and this point of law.
NEUT8|Now we are far away from children under the point since the Amazon.com hit the 3400 points as a maximum for now.
NEUT9|Now if we analyze this yesterday bands and with zoom in and is as reached the upper hand OK, so from here we should be experiences as strong retrace Hilderbrand.
NEUT10|At least, which is passing right now at 2200 points.
NEUT11|So my idea considering also this engulfing bearish is that the Amazon.com is going to retrace at least as a first at this area, so 2500 points.
NEUT12|From here we should be experienced as more rebound and then we should be retesting 2000 points.
BULL13|"Thank you guys."""
