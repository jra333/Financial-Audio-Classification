NEUT0|"""Tom White from DA Davidson and Angelo Zeno from CFR a Tom."
NEUT1|I come to you first.
NEUT2|Did they prove the type of resilience that you were looking for?
NEUT3|Yeah, I think I think you have to say that they have looked at the two things that stood out to me at looking at the numbers here.
BEAR4|One just the revenue outperformance, so revenues declined about 22% year over year.
BEAR5|Excluding the impact of FX St was, I think expecting kind of a down 35% number.
BULL6|So yes, certainly resilient.
BEAR7|And if you compare their revenue performance to some of the other online travel assets that everybody gets compared to like booking Holdings and Expedia, both of those companies saw their revenues down.
BEAR8|You know North of 60% year over year, so Air BNB down 22%.
NEUT9|The other thing that stood out is you know there's been a lot of discussion about how this recovery in travel globally has really not been particularly linear, which is something investors would like to see is sort of a steady trajectory of improvement in the underlying trends, and for a lot of the companies it hasn't been linear, but Air B&B in the letter talked about the first quarter revenue growth forecast does show you know, moderating pace of further moderation in the revenue decline.
NEUT10|So there does seem to be a little bit more maybe.
NEUT11|Linearity and Air BNB upgrades, and some of the other companies must.
NEUT12|Basically your take Angela.
NEUT13|I would I would echo all those comments.
NEUT14|I mean when you kind of look at the results here.
BULL15|I mean, it definitely shows a lot of resiliency relative to the the broader travel space.
BEAR16|I mean, you're looking at sales down only 22% relatively to where we were originally looking at about down 34%.
BULL17|Looking at the gross bookings value also significantly better than where we had anticipated, you know, we would have liked to have seen a 2021 outlook, but you know definitely didn't anticipate one managing costs extremely well.
NEUT18|Kind of amid the pandemic.
BULL19|And you know, I think they're very well positioned.
NEUT20|Kind of going here into 2021 as we kind of start seeing that recovery into the second half of the year.
BULL21|So how how Tom did they prove more resilient than the rest of the travel sector?
NEUT22|What sort of pivots did Airbnb make, and how does that set them up for post pandemic?
NEUT23|Yeah, so look, I don't think that they.
NEUT24|I wouldn't say that they made any hits.
NEUT25|If anything, the pivot was just focusing on the core, and that's really focusing on hosts first and foremost.
NEUT26|Also, you know this idea of just sort of local experiences and and really kind of sticking to that coordinating of what?
NEUT27|Air B and Air BNB started with, you know, I think the way I like to think about it is over the course of the pandemic.
NEUT28|You know Air BNB went from being a true alternative in the eyes of a lot of people who are looking to book lodging to now being really kind of a standard or typical way that people are going to look to travel.
BULL29|So we think their position pretty well post pandemic.
BULL30|As I said, great new customer acquisition opportunity.
NEUT31|The pandemic is clearly been for Air B&B and the pandemics also opened up some new use cases, we think.
NEUT32|For this business, things like work from home, work from rather work, from anywhere that I think could provide solid tailwinds for business.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
