NEUT0|"""Today we're going to do analysis on Amazon."
NEUT1|Amazon has very interesting trend options here.
NEUT2|You can see that.
BULL3|This support here, which I'm labeling old support.
BULL4|Was a pretty solid support.
NEUT5|We had one.
BULL6|2-3 solid touches and then it breached and it breached that support.
NEUT7|Substantially several days in a row and on stronger than average volume so this support line here is no longer that's over.
BULL8|Amazon has not had the crazy rocket ship rise that some other companies like Tesla have had, but now I see a new support possibly forming and I'm seeing this not just with Amazon with other stocks, and also the broad general market with the indexes are also doing this, creating this possible new support where we have a touch.
NEUT9|Here we have a touch here.
BULL10|An we might hit this support now if we do hit support here then.
BULL11|If it bounces and we have two or three days of confirmation on good solid volume of it bouncing off this, it's definitely a buy point.
NEUT12|On the other hand, it's possible that it might bounce and then breakthrough if that happens.
NEUT13|I don't see a support insight we just had.
BEAR14|Really unsustainable rise way back in March.
NEUT15|Like a lot of stocks did like the general market did.
BEAR16|And of course that was due to the pandemic.
NEUT17|Now we're in back to.
NEUT18|Approaching normalcy in the market and that's why you're seeing a lot of stocks starting to move sideways, and the major indexes starting to move sideways, but doesn't mean they're not going to continue uptrend.
NEUT19|And it doesn't mean it's not a good time to invest.
BULL20|It just means that we're probably going to start seeing more reasonable action in the stock market.
NEUT21|Unless we have a crash.
NEUT22|I don't see that happening, but hey, I'm not a fortune teller.
NEUT23|I'm just reading the chart and right now the chart is telling me that this area of support is the next area that I'm going to be watching, like a Hawk, and I think a lot of people are going to be watching this area right in here to see exactly what's going to happen.
NEUT24|If it bounces and we have two or three days of confirmation, I'm definitely going to put money in it.
NEUT25|If it bounces through, I'm not going to do anything.
NEUT26|All right.
NEUT27|"Let's watch and see what happens over the next few days."""
