NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 8th of December 2020, Tuesday, the 2nd day of the week.
BULL2|We're at #29 a few particular Eve so far, Eva gains BDC.
NEUT3|We're not exactly sure what's happening.
BEAR4|I think in a small timeframes this could be a double bearish.
BEAR5|Divergent sanave could be dropping lower, right?
NEUT6|We don't really see any clear bullishness right for a week and still go higher, but I don't think we'll be going higher.
NEUT7|Much will go higher, but not much.
NEUT8|Not in my opinion.
BULL9|I hope you're going to that high.
NEUT10|I think more likely than not there should be.
NEUT11|A correction coming on for eventually.
BEAR12|There should be a correction because for eight we've been rising so high, so crazily and usually when you touch the skinny pink line.
NEUT13|More likely than not, you should be going under for a extended period of time here for a period of time not extendable for a period of time.
NEUT14|We should be dropping lower for a for games BTC and we should be spending some time under this skinny pink line as it starts curving down right?
BEAR15|This could be the beginning of a bear trend.
BEAR16|This could be a sign that a bad trend could be about to begin for a for against.
NEUT17|ET C again when it comes to trade ability, I don't see any tradeable chop it down for a for games PC at this point of time, right?
BEAR18|The volume has been disappearing for a for games PC and so it could be very careful about going to a trade too.
BEAR19|So I'm not saying we can't go up and we could still form a continuation pattern over here and then we could still rise higher, But yeah, this is quite weak.
NEUT20|Looks quite weak to me so be very careful about going to attract too soon, right?
NEUT21|Let's move on to a if against USD T before that please video like you.
NEUT22|Ready to subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about anything.
NEUT23|Documents be forever against USD T you know this is a higher high.
BEAR24|And you can see that we have lower highs on the RSI lower highs under Magni D must make me D. And so if you see me like potentially, there could be a reversal coming on for a forgives USD however, however, things are still looking pretty bullish.
BULL25|We could still go higher.
BEAR26|We could still break $100 first before dropping lower.
NEUT27|All I know is that there's nothing tradeable on Eva gives USD at this point of time and so against.
NEUT28|I wouldn't be putting on any trips for eight, not at this point of time.
NEUT29|I mean, I would love to take trips for eight, but I just don't see anything on the charts at this point of time.
NEUT30|Can we go higher?
NEUT31|Sure how we going to start reversing from here.
NEUT32|I can't say for sure.
NEUT33|I don't see any clear reversal bearish reversals, yet there are bearish divergences, but just because you see a double bearish divergance doesn't mean things are going to start reversing right.
NEUT34|So be very careful about going to a trade too soon, right?
NEUT35|I guess I see from my Eve technical analysis.
BULL36|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL37|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT38|"I shall see you in the next video."""
