NEUT0|"""How do you adapt and adjust to Q2?"
NEUT1|Yeah well thanks time yeah I think that the Q2 is going to be the actual reopening right?
NEUT2|So the dream of reopening the dream of restarting the economy is always bullish into.
NEUT3|You know, there's no proof.
BULL4|Prove it moment now as we actually reopen economy, we're going to do it, and execution risk goes up.
NEUT5|So that's not the end of the Bull market center disaster, but at the stock level.
BEAR6|You know we're expecting disappointment.
BEAR7|I mean, we think it's going to be difficult for a lot of companies to manage this.
NEUT8|And oh, by the way, some companies are going to take advantage of it.
NEUT9|Take Sharon will operate quite well, so one of our recent calls is, you know, we did downgrade smallcaps, it said a heck of a run and it's kind of a lower quality area and we're basically recommending that people do upgrade the portfolio bit on the quality side as we go through this reopening.
NEUT10|In Q2 and Q3.
NEUT11|Is it fair to say you think this is a sound?
NEUT12|The news event Mike?
NEUT13|Well, I don't think it's a sell.
NEUT14|The news and in terms of you know, equities over bonds.
NEUT15|In that regard, I think it's more of a let's just get the low quality part of the trade is really worked.
NEUT16|As you know John.
BEAR17|I mean, we've been bullish from the lows on the idea.
NEUT18|That's what always happens and low quality does really well coming off a recession.
NEUT19|We looked at that data recently, and the relative outperformance of low quality over higher quality and some other things we can talk about has been extraordinary small caps over large for example.
NEUT20|And we just want to capture that because this is the time of the recovery.
BULL21|"Any cycle where you revert back a little consolidation and quality actually becomes more in favor again, at least temporarily."""
