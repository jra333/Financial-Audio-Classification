NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and today's video."
NEUT1|I just want to go over Netflix.
BEAR2|Which technically speaking is starting to show us a lot of weakness.
BULL3|It's now back at the uptrend line for the 4th time here and we saw a nice bounce Friday.
BEAR4|But again, today it is testing the line so we're having a lot of selling pressure, especially with the sector rotation that we're starting to witness as we see a lot of tech stocks going down and those shares and the.
NEUT5|That money is going towards recovery stocks instead.
NEUT6|So.
NEUT7|Of course, doesn't mean that Netflix is a, it's it's done.
NEUT8|It's going to go to 0, but.
BULL9|We could expect to see something like a good correction here, as people are going more towards recovery stocks.
BEAR10|So technically speaking, it's really about this uptrend line and if it breaks we could see a cascade of stop losses.
NEUT11|And really after that the next like the next key levels to monitor.
NEUT12|I really like the 5th personally because they do fit with a critical support and resistances and the chart.
NEUT13|So I break out of this uptrend line I think could lead us to well for sure this is the first step will be to 38.2 but you know a lot of stop losses are there so.
BULL14|It looks like Netflix could start to break and really reach the 50% fib, which is from the covid rally, but that would be the first really key level here at $442 and if this level doesn't hold, then at 61.8 becomes very interesting because we have a clear support here on the chart.
BULL15|So again, if we start to have a cascade of stop losses and we really start to see a correction, we could monitor to have perhaps better prices around at this price.
NEUT16|"For this price here."""
