NEUT0|"""What is up you guys?"
NEUT1|Peter Carlo here traders helping traders and in this video we're going to be going over Apple stock.
BEAR2|Not going to spend too much time on this video because I have a lot more to put out, but overall Apple has been taking a bit of a beating.
NEUT3|I do have a position right now.
BEAR4|I'm down $481.00.
BEAR5|I have about 70 shares and I will probably add to this position by close in the next 20-30 minutes, but overall we have taken a bit of a hit.
BEAR6|You can see that we're falling down to major support right now at $130 an.
NEUT7|Every single day that this has been down this week, big money has been buying the living crap out of it.
BULL8|The flow has been extremely well, extremely consistent, tons of money pouring into Apple calls and into Apple in general.
NEUT9|Through, you know, dark pools and whatnot were holding here at 1:30.
BULL10|We're taking a really nice balance, and if we zoom in a little closer at this 30 minute, you can see that we have a really good reverse head and shoulders forming and we also have a really good bullish divergences for me here.
BULL11|I think we're going to hold at 1:30 that they were going to take a good push up to 135.
NEUT12|Probably find some sort of resistance, and I think that within the next month, probably by March.
NEUT13|Second or third week of March will be back at $145.00 guys.
BULL14|Overall, this is a really good position.
NEUT15|I really like the way this is setting up.
NEUT16|I have some shares right now.
NEUT17|If it wasn't shares I'd be looking at maybe some March 19th 1:30 calls or like some April 16th 131 thirty five calls.
BEAR18|Overall guys let me know what you think market has been getting beaten up pretty badly in the past couple of days, but I think Apple is going to be fine.
NEUT19|The next thing to take a look at that just really quick before we hop off is the amount of dark pool activity that we've had on Apple in the past day, right?
NEUT20|We have almost 123, four $500 million worth of dark pools moving in on Apple's.
BULL21|Overall we are claiming this support.
NEUT22|We're making this line in the sand.
NEUT23|Big monies buying.
NEUT24|I think this entire week was just a huge shake out and I am buying Apple stock and.
