NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this."
NEUT1|Be a video chart on ticker symbol EYES.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, overall pretty quiet day and then the afternoon showed up and that's where things got very, very interesting for next week.
NEUT6|So much so that a big technical event occur.
NEUT7|Dan, a big update needs to be done in.
NEUT8|This update is based on just a foundational role in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken, which was here you want to see them act as support.
NEUT9|So got the pattern breakout late day today.
NEUT10|So 1350 was that area of resistance which you can actually see acted as resistance once again earlier on in the day price got up there once again got rejected.
NEUT11|But not that time late day surge, right?
NEUT12|There broke above that level.
NEUT13|So now moving forward 1350 is now what would be what I would call the ideal level of support device.
NEUT14|A cleaner won't make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
BULL15|Well yeah, ideally if the price can say above 1350, that would be a fantastic sign of power.
NEUT16|But let me actually just get rid of that line now.
NEUT17|It served its purpose but now moving forward from more of an overarching standpoint.
NEUT18|Keep it on that purple line right there.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Moving average 'cause the longer the price stays above that level, that area is going to start to curl back upwards and when it starts to get upwards angle to it.
NEUT21|At that point, you know that the trend is back in the bull's favor, and at that point you just want to see the price stay above that line.
BULL22|So as the line itself moves higher and higher, as long as the price can stay above it, that is definitely a step in a symbol that the Bulls are in full health still and that the Bulls still have full.
NEUT23|You know, ownership of the current, you know breakout that's occurred today because once again that's what happened.
BULL24|It was a late day break out of that area resistance.
NEUT25|So how do you gauge the health of the breakout?
NEUT26|Watch that purple line and as long as the price is above it, then that implies that it's still a quote, unquote healthy breakout in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT27|Next level to watch now moving forward going to be right up there at $16.00 and 15 or $16.50 and then after 1650 next key level after that.
NEUT28|Going to be right up there at $18.85, so keep around those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
BULL29|But All in all, great way to end the week.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you.
NEUT40|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live.
NEUT42|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT43|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
