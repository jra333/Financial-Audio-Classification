BEAR0|"""Carroll high unemployment is taking its toll on consumer spending, which in turn is taking a toll on the bottom line."
NEUT1|For more on the earnings front, let's bring in Robin Griffiths too.
NEUT2|Technical analyst at Cazenove Capital Management.
NEUT3|He joins us from London.
NEUT4|Mr. Griffiths.
NEUT5|Welcome to Bloomberg News and tell us about that bottom line.
NEUT6|What's it looking like?
NEUT7|Well, I think the secret is certain companies will be able to keep their costs very well under control, and unfortunately the variable factor that lets them do that is the labor cost.
BEAR8|Obviously, compared to China and India, the Western world and Europe in particular hike expensive labor market and by laying people off or putting them on part time, they can keep that cost under control.
BULL9|So it may well be that corporate profits do rather better than personal budgets going forward.
NEUT10|From here, I think that will be.
BEAR11|The secret, I mean in the result season results, which are less bad than had been expected, are quite likely an and the missing in green will be.
BULL12|They've been able to keep costs under control.
BULL13|Robin, let me just ask you about some of the trade we're seeing today over in Europe we had a lot of takeover activity M&A activity in a bunch of different sectors, good sign assigned to you though, that maybe things are slowly getting back on track here.
BEAR14|I'm afraid I come down on the gloomy side answering that the overall technical chart pattern for European markets, particularly Germany in France, is that they're very they're in a bear market.
BEAR15|They're making the indices are making a pattern of falling highs and lows below, falling moving averages, and that the rally from the March low quite clearly ended about six weeks ago on both the cat and the decks.
NEUT16|There is a very small head and shoulders top.
NEUT17|Satin not dissimilar to the one on the S&P and the so-called neckline of that was broken a few days ago.
NEUT18|The good news is the prediction from that head and shoulders does not take you back down as low as the March low, but it almost certainly gives you 1/2 to 2/3 retracement of the of the rally before we get our next buying opportunity and running.
NEUT19|So timing.
BEAR20|Yeah, Robin, I'm sorry.
NEUT21|I'm just wondering what's the aim between now and October?
NEUT22|What is the aim?
NEUT23|Yeah, is it to presume to know absolutely preserve capital?
BULL24|Possibly even park, if you like in the short term, in a government bond which is already actually going up in price modestly?
BULL25|Or just make sure you've got the cash because the purchasing power of your cash will be increasing even though you get no actual return on it.
BULL26|And if you've got the money to buy the late October dip, which I'm pretty sure you are going to get, you will pick up some genuinely cheap stocks and as long as the low is above the March low.
NEUT27|That gives will then give a proper an more optimistic buying signal.
NEUT28|Robin Griffiths, chief technical analyst at Cazenove Capital Management, joining us from London.
BULL29|"Robin, thanks, Carol."""
