NEUT0|"""OK, so here's the deal."
NEUT1|Here's my prediction.
NEUT2|Today is what January 25.
NEUT3|Yes, January 25, 2021 according to Billy.
BEAR4|Facebook's gonna miss their numbers, missed their estimates on Wednesday when they report they're going to miss their numbers.
BEAR5|And their stock is going to drop.
BEAR6|You wake up on Thursday morning and Facebook stocks going to be down 10%.
NEUT7|Or more now, hope so.
NEUT8|We're going to play this on Friday.
NEUT9|In either, we're going to say Billy was right or Billy look at Facebook stock is higher.
NEUT10|You were wrong.
NEUT11|What's your prediction?
NEUT12|Smith?
NEUT13|You think I'm right, man.
NEUT14|I I have a hard time not getting emotional with this one just because I.
NEUT15|Right here on Facebook Live right now.
NEUT16|I wouldn't say that last thing you want is taken down I. I hope that it goes.
BULL17|I hope that they go down with the actions that they've been taking.
BEAR18|I would hate to see that they've done all the things they have recently and it just continues shooting up like a rocket that is just.
NEUT19|So so I understand you don't want him to be rewarded for doing bad things exactly.
NEUT20|Course I agree with that, but here's here is.
NEUT21|Here's some good information.
NEUT22|Don't hurt yourself, but cause.
NEUT23|You want somebody else to be punished.
NEUT24|I'd love to see him be punished as well, but I'll tell you two things.
BEAR25|Yes, I'm in a short position in my stocks on Facebook, 'cause I'm expecting them to go down.
NEUT26|But here's the rest of my prediction.
NEUT27|I think they're going.
BEAR28|I think they're going to go down 20%.
BEAR29|Because they're going to miss that down over a lot of revenue they lossed in in December, however.
BEAR30|In January, I know for a fact that revenue has picked back up, so their first quarter will be better if it drops.
BEAR31|If it drops 20%.
NEUT32|I'm buying big time and I'm going to ride that way back to the top like they're going to make money.
NEUT33|I want to make money off of him.
NEUT34|I don't want.
BEAR35|"I don't want to sit back and say, man, I wish they weren't making money."""
