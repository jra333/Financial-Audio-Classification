NEUT0|"""Hey fools, Brian Henman, here analyst with Motley Fool Pro in Motley Fool options."
NEUT1|I'm here to take part in our ask a full series right now.
NEUT2|Patrick is asking a question on Facebook.
NEUT3|Patrick asks what is the easiest way to start investing with options?
NEUT4|Some of the more advanced methods like that well, I'm happy to answer your question, Patrick.
NEUT5|First of all, investing in stocks and investing in options.
NEUT6|Are very similar.
NEUT7|To make money investing in stocks, you buy a stock, right?
BULL8|It increases in value.
NEUT9|You make money.
NEUT10|If you buy a call option and that underlying stock increases in price.
BULL11|Your call option also increases in value.
NEUT12|So less than one is that they're very similar.
NEUT13|But there are some key differences between buying stocks and buying options.
NEUT14|So let's walk through a few of those.
NEUT15|First.
NEUT16|Difference is that buying options is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying stocks.
NEUT17|But why is that one option is just a contract reference to that underlying stock.
NEUT18|It has it.
NEUT19|Find life, it's just really a contract between two parties.
NEUT20|But if you buy a stock, you're buying a piece of a business.
NEUT21|You get to vote at the annual meeting.
NEUT22|You get a small piece of the company's cash flows for the rest of its life.
BEAR23|The second difference is that if you buy an option and your thesis doesn't work out for you, you could lose your entire investment.
BEAR24|But if you buy a stock and it doesn't workout, chances are the stock just declines in value.
NEUT25|You don't lose all the money you put in, so that's a pretty big difference.
NEUT26|Let's look at a quick example.
NEUT27|Say you wanted to buy either 100 shares of Apple stock, or buy one call option on Apple.
NEUT28|Well, at $500 a share, buying 100 shares would cost you about $50,000.
NEUT29|If you wanted to buy just one contract on Apple shares, it would cost you about $800.
NEUT30|But remember, it's all about tradeoffs here.
BEAR31|If Apple's stock doesn't increase in value over the next two years, you'll lose that entire $800.
NEUT32|If, if you own the stock, however, and apples price doesn't increase in value, you'll still own the shares of very good business.
NEUT33|So there are clear differences between buying stock and buying options, but they're also very similar.
NEUT34|Great question, Patrick.
