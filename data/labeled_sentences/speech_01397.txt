NEUT0|"""It's time for Barron's Buzz or we take a sneak peek at the new issue of Barron's Magazine."
NEUT1|Joining me now is senior editor Jack how Jack?
BULL2|Thanks for being here.
NEUT3|All right, let's start.
NEUT4|Beware of hidden risks in high yields.
NEUT5|What are you looking at?
NEUT6|You actually have a pair of stories on the high yield market this week.
BEAR7|One talks about how money managers, some of them have been exiting.
BEAR8|Another warns of the risk for people who hold mutual funds that focus on short term high yield bonds.
NEUT9|Lot of folks out there thinking I want some extra yield, but I don't want to take that risk and longer bonds so I'll stay short and that will keep me safe and our writer points out.
BEAR10|You have to be careful because as interest rates rise in bond yields rise, some of these bonds may become a held for longer than originally anticipated.
NEUT11|They may miss some call opportunity, so you could have more duration in your short term bond fund than you think, and be more subject to some price risk there.
NEUT12|And you guys are also taking a look at high PE stocks in this issue.
NEUT13|What are you watching there?
BEAR14|I've really gotten clobbered all of these darling stocks that we talk about.
NEUT15|Many of them were down by double digit percentages over the past month, so it's an opportunity to take a look at, say, under what circumstances are elevated PE ratios worth paying?
BULL16|We do just that, certainly not all of these stocks are bargains here, but we do manage to find one or two.
NEUT17|Last step, you call the workplace a jungle.
NEUT18|This story makes me sad.
NEUT19|The over achievers at work.
BEAR20|It makes me sad too.
NEUT21|There's there's a survey here by Midwestern offices of a financial company and they look at out performers at work and they find that they can be subject to.
BEAR22|To basically bullying the silent treatment, undue blame, and even sabotaged by their coworkers and the bigger of an outperformer, they are the worst.
BEAR23|The bullying can sometimes be.
NEUT24|Maybe This is why I've been getting wedgies at barons all the time.
NEUT25|I'm starting to wonder all right?
BULL26|"Well, we have to make sure that that comes to it and Jack Howeth thanks very much for joining us."""
