NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris."
BULL1|Take a look at the S&P 500 and you can see the S&P 500 has rallied quite nicely during the trading session.
BEAR2|After a 14.7% unemployment figure out of the United States.
BEAR3|Not as bad as anticipated.
BEAR4|That being said though, there's a lot of noise above between the 200 day MA, the 61.8 the 3000 level.
BEAR5|All of this is likely to cause problems because of this.
NEUT6|It will be very interesting to see how this behaves over the next day or two.
BEAR7|This could be a major inflection point.
NEUT8|If we clear 3000, then find you can't argue with it anymore.
NEUT9|"However, if we roll over from here, that could be the first move towards the 50 day Ma and then possibly down here to about 2640 or so."""
