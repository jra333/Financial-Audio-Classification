NEUT0|"""Miles has the numbers right now coming out from alphabet of Miles."
NEUT1|Yeah, so let's just go through the headline here.
NEUT2|Just earnings per share $9.87.
NEUT3|That's light relative to the street.
NEUT4|Was looking for 1397 on an adjusted basis.
NEUT5|Ex tax revenues 33.7 billion.
BULL6|That's beating the street estimate for $32.6 billion.
NEUT7|Just kind of going through the line items here that we get from the alphabet release in terms of revenues for the current quarter.
NEUT8|We saw You Tube ads about $4.1 billion.
BULL9|That was up from $3.1 billion the same quarter last year.
BULL10|So 2033% rather increased there and what we're seeing on the YouTube side, you know, Google search 24 1/2 billion against 22 1/2 last year.
BULL11|I think in this environment it is notable and you know, alphabet, like so many other tech companies looking at their head count 123 thousand employees at the end of the first quarter up from 100 and 4103 and a half thousand at the same point last year.
NEUT12|And as we move into this environment where?
NEUT13|I think people I think a lot of companies are going to look at right sizing various operations.
NEUT14|You know that's a big number to go from 1000 give or take 100 and 5200 and 25,000 give or take in just one year.
NEUT15|So what we'll see if we get any news there.
NEUT16|The other Bets segment operating income or the operating loss rather for other bets, $1.12 billion in the most recent quarter.
BEAR17|That's up from $868 million in the same quarter last year, so still losing money out of the other bets.
NEUT18|I think there's some expectation that there's going to be a change.
NEUT19|In how the alphabet Google structure is run going forward, we'll see if we get any more color on that, but I think overall again the company missing on the bottom line, beating on the top line going to be all about what they say, longer term, and at least in the press release here.
NEUT20|Not a ton of color on on where Alphabet leadership thinks the company is headed, and it's pretty tight here with poor at the CFO of Alphabet and Google.
BEAR21|Just saying that performance was strong during the first two months of the quarter, but then in March we experienced a significant slowdown in AD revenues.
NEUT22|Are Ichneumon we heard Miles talking about sort of the labor picture at Alphabet and it strikes me that today and this isn't what's in there, but this of course is what people are thinking about.
BEAR23|We've had trip adviser 900 layoffs, the information reporting just now that Uber is looking at layoffs of some 20%.
NEUT24|So first of all, this seemed like a blue collar issue for labor.
BEAR25|It's bleeding very heavily.
NEUT26|It seems into tech.
NEUT27|It's the physical presence problem.
BEAR28|So I I think we're going to see so many more high profile layoffs because it's just inevitable.
BEAR29|I mean, it's not just the businesses where you can't operate if you can't stand close to each other, can't be in close proximity, but it's the demand that's drying up all over the place.
BEAR30|So I think the most interesting thing we've heard from Google is what you just mentioned Jen significant slowdown in AD revenue.
NEUT31|That's you know all kinds of companies advertise on Google.
NEUT32|This is just not just the tech.
NEUT33|Economy, it's the whole economy, especially consumer product.
BEAR34|So those companies are having no revenue or very little cash flow right out.
BEAR35|Of course, they're going to shut down, you know, call back their ad spending.
NEUT36|So I think we're going to see this.
NEUT37|I think this is, you know.
BEAR38|Remember, this is just a sliver of the first quarter, and it's going to get really ugly in the second.
