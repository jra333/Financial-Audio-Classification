NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and thank you for joining this technical analysis video here at xm.com."
NEUT1|It's Wednesday, November 4th, a day after the US election and today will be looking at how Dollar Yen is reacting as the counting of votes continues.
NEUT2|So zooming into the daily chart, we can see that other base between hundred 404 twenty.
BULL3|I remained strongly in place last weekend for the 4th month, helping the price to bounce back towards its 2050 day moving average is interesting Lee since the price is refusing to reach the bottom of the channel that.
BULL4|Makes upside corrections towards the upper bound of the channel more possible, and looking at the RSI, although the indicator is still below 50 neutral market seems that it has already found a bottom within the bearish area, giving another encouraging signal for the market on.
BULL5|Nevertheless, we first need to enter the 105 area and then close above the 20 or 50 day amaze, breaking the 23.6% Fibo Nachi of the 100 to 9 point, 84103.99.
NEUT6|Sound like at the same time at 105.37 before we stretched towards the tours.
NEUT7|The channels upper surface still had the short term.
BULL8|Outlook wouldn't change to positive in this case unless the pair rallies above the channel and the 30 point 2% Fibonacci of 106.22 and more importantly sustains US strength above the 50% of 106.90.
NEUT9|Now in the negative scenario where the 104.104 base.
BULL10|Collapses are the pair could aggressively stretch its downtrend tours.
BEAR11|The 103 level was slightly deeper.
BULL12|The 102 point 2626 level, which was a key barrier on March 9th and 10th should be closely watched for support as well, so that's all for Dollar Yen today.
BULL13|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
