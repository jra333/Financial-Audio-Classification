NEUT0|"""Germany isn't it, Linda?"
NEUT1|Yes, it is.
BEAR2|8.7 is where we're at at the moment, but we get nearly 11% at one point this morning.
NEUT3|And again, it's all down to folks wagon.
NEUT4|What is going on here is unbelievable.
BULL5|The share it nearly doubled this morning.
BULL6|It reached a level of â‚¬1005.00 and already yesterday the carmaker rose 147%, causing the tax sustained positive territory when the rest of Europe was declining.
NEUT7|What is really going on here is very hard to say.
NEUT8|It must be the worst case scenario.
NEUT9|Short squeeze.
NEUT10|One can in fact imagine an it's it's all about Pasha saying over the weekend that they hold 42.6% in folks wagon currently and another 31.5% via option.
NEUT11|So indirectly partial holds nearly 75%.
NEUT12|The federal state of Lower Saxony they hold another 20 point 2%.
NEUT13|So just over 20%.
NEUT14|So effectively there's only a tiny free float left of just under 6%, five point 7%.
BEAR15|And if everybody is short in a share with such tiny free float.
NEUT16|If those two things come together, then that can cause these severe disruptions that we're seeing again today or is 1 Alice.
NEUT17|He put it each an every short seller.
BEAR18|In the world is trying to close up their positions, and there's no way they can do it except for trying to buy like mad, so so it's panic among investors.
BEAR19|Many had bet on VW share price to fall, so the shares recent move.
BEAR20|It's all down to covering of short positions rather than any fundamentals 'cause they don't look as good as you might suggest when looking at the share price, and that is having also severe effect on the other members of the ducks such as the India index heavyweights Aliansi Menzie on because.
NEUT21|Index tracking funds they're selling.
BEAR22|There's selling the 29 other companies listed index to catch up with Volkswagen, and it's a big embarrassment.
NEUT23|In fact, for the German market, Yep, they need to get it done.
NEUT24|They need to get it sorted.
NEUT25|They need to figure out a way of doing this that everybody can understand.
BULL26|"Linda, thank you very much in do, indeed."""
