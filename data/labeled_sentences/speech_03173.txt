BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to another video because we're having a fantastic day before I can start with this one guys."
BEAR1|I'm going to mention that I've linked to my discord in the scription.
NEUT2|We have over 250 members now.
NEUT3|You do day trading calls for trading options every single morning, so that's something interesting.
NEUT4|Feel free to check it out, but other than that let's get right into this video.
NEUT5|So as you can see here today I'm going over FedEx ticker symbol.
NEUT6|FDX currently trading at $254.70 there up.
NEUT7|$18.03 which is 7.71% in after hours that is following their release of their Quarter 2 earnings.
BEAR8|And as you can see, for most of the day they were red at 10:45.
NEUT9|There were $232.17 at that time.
BEAR10|That was a negative 1.76% move to the downside, which was also $4.72.
BULL11|If we take a look at the weekly chart for them, guys can't see that they are up 12% in the past week, the monthly up 22%, the three month 84 and then the yearly they are up 47% so they have had some.
BULL12|Freestyle it steady growth.
BULL13|Obviously this earnings report was a huge couch for them guys, and if we take a look at the numbers for this, you can see that the earnings are expected to decline 16.7% to $2.54 per share in the actual results of that were $4.87 per share, which is up 60% and revenue is expected to increase to 17.46 billion in revenue is actually 19.3 billion.
BULL14|So that's great news there guys.
NEUT15|I mean this one.
BEAR16|I'd expect to be just due to the coronavirus causing a lot of people.
NEUT17|Shop on line having deliveries and things like that.
BULL18|And congratulations to all you guys who were holding call options on them.
BULL19|$16.00 and after hours will be huge gains tomorrow morning.
NEUT20|Another thing to note guys is that their rival UPS is also up in after hours and if you take a look at their chart you can see that on the day they were up Dollar thirty nine and they're open additional 3.32% which is $5.37 and after hours we take a look at FedEx once again.
NEUT21|Guys if you were going to trade options on them I do think that this could be a decent day trade tomorrow.
NEUT22|I did call them out on my.
NEUT23|Nightly watch this last night, as you can see right about there.
NEUT24|And if we take a look at this one guys for their option chain, these options will be pretty expensive.
NEUT25|I don't think you should chase this play 'cause there could be some profit taking tomorrow on a FedEx, but as you can see these prices aren't accurate.
NEUT26|This isn't factoring in the after hours movement.
NEUT27|I would do something that expires.
NEUT28|Probably the end of this week just for a quick day trade.
NEUT29|Do something up here like the 260 call I think.
BULL30|Could be good play.
NEUT31|I won't be surprised if FedEx does reach 260 in premarket or after hours today, so this one could be a potential play if it isn't there yet.
NEUT32|And in that case that is about it for this video.
NEUT33|Be very interesting to see if FedEx can hold these levels that they have created in after hours.
BULL34|Other than that guys, thank you so much for watching.
NEUT35|As always.
BULL36|I really do appreciate the support.
NEUT37|As I mentioned I have linked to my discord in description as well as my Robin Hood referral link.
BULL38|But then that guys thank you so much for watching.
NEUT39|"I will see you guys all in the next video."""
