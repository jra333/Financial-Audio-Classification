BEAR0|"""And we don't know a notable argument breaking out on Twitter last night surrounding a drive by workers at an Alabama Amazon warehouse to unionize, Deidre Bosa has the back and forth on that good morning, Deidre."
NEUT1|Hey Becky, so this was rare, but not totally unusual.
BEAR2|Public move from Amazon.
NEUT3|A top executive, Dave Clark.
BEAR4|He is S VP of Worldwide Operations clapping back at a tweet in a tweet at Bernie Sanders, who has supported the unionization drive at that Amazon Warehouse.
NEUT5|And he'll actually be visiting workers tomorrow, Clark said.
BULL6|Quote I welcome Senator Sanders to Birmingham and appreciate his push for a progressive workplace.
NEUT7|I often say that we are the Bernie Sanders of employers, but that's not quite right because we.
BULL8|Actually deliver a progressive workplace for our constituents.
NEUT9|He goes on to outline Amazon's $15 minimum wage and benefits that they offer no small amount of sarcasm there.
BEAR10|But then Democratic Representative Mark Pocan he hit back with this tweet, paying workers $15.00 an hour doesn't make you a progressive workplace when you union bust and make workers urinate in bottles.
NEUT11|Amazon's official Twitter handle then shot back with you don't really believe peeing in a bottle.
NEUT12|Is peeing in bottles is a thing?
NEUT13|Do you if that was true, nobody would work for us?
NEUT14|Now guys there is more but I will leave it there with the back and forth.
BEAR15|The point here is that this unionization drive at Amazon's Alabama warehouse is heating up.
BULL16|Vote counting begins shortly, May 30th were very unlikely to get a clear decision for some time because of expected appeals, but this could really and it's shaping up to be a critical inflection point for Amazon and the US labor movement guys.
NEUT17|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT18|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
