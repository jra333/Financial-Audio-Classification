BEAR0|"""This is basically a Wall Street Unicorn."
NEUT1|What is it worth?
NEUT2|25 billion walking through, so there's something that's happening on Wall Street where people are taking big stakes in private equity firms.
BULL3|An now that private equity firms have become so hotly valued.
NEUT4|People are moving to direct lending firms, and so these are the this private credit rush.
NEUT5|Owl Rock is something that was created by former executives of BlackRock KKR.
NEUT6|Goldman Sachs, only four years old now were $2.5 billion.
NEUT7|Did they did this whole stake sale thing?
NEUT8|Sold the stake to Neuberger Berman's dial capital?
NEUT9|The biggest stake sale business which just recently raised $9 billion in the largest ever fund to take stakes in firms.
NEUT10|Just like this interesting and just like this you mean direct lending firms direct lending firms.
NEUT11|They've done private equity firms.
NEUT12|They've done a hedge fund firms where the initial strategy started.
BEAR13|But as we know, the hedge fund industry has a lot of problems in it these days.
BEAR14|A lot of pressure.
BULL15|But direct lending is still hot, and firms like Owl Rock compete directly with the banks.
NEUT16|They're doing bigger deals.
BULL17|They just recently signed on to $1.6 billion deal.
NEUT18|One of the largest ever of its kind to refinance the debt tide to a Kelso backed company.
NEUT19|And so the private equity firms are all working together in these private debt markets.
BULL20|And that's the opportunity here.
NEUT21|Interesting in the same way that we talk about private equity for the building up.
NEUT22|Like their capital markets arms sort of thing like this.
BULL23|Emerging is a real competitor to banks in that way as well.
NEUT24|There seriously working altogether in that deal you had KKR.
NEUT25|You had Goldman in this Kelso deal.
NEUT26|You had a lot of other direct lenders as well.
NEUT27|Worries about direct lending like where are the issues with it?
NEUT28|Moment size companies, right?
NEUT29|The whole point is you go there 'cause you might not get a loan somewhere else.
NEUT30|Like remember this is this is that shadow banking market that remember Christian Meissner just last week was telling us about your Bloomberg that people are really worried about the shadow market because do they have enough capital to withhold the risk that they're taking on?
NEUT31|Remember, they're not a bank, this is not deposit or money.
NEUT32|"This is LP money that's coming in, but that doesn't mean that they aren't necessarily edging into riskier parts of the capital structure that others are not willing to go into."""
