NEUT0|"""Yo when Christine, what's going on today is December 11th, 2020."
NEUT1|And the market is officially closed, so let's go ahead and take a look at what has happened over the week.
NEUT2|So last week when we were on here, we were looking at the SNP an we had put a new level on there for it to get to around 3800.
BEAR3|So the market took a little bit of a dip.
BULL4|From the beginning of the week and it is now hovering near its twenty day moving average, so it should try to bounce off of there and continue its momentum higher.
NEUT5|So I'm looking actually for next week to push back towards the highs that they had created this week around that 3700 area and take it out.
NEUT6|So that is my prediction for next week.
NEUT7|So let's take a look at how IWM perform for this week as well.
NEUT8|So I WM.
BULL9|It made highs as well.
NEUT10|Ann is tracking along just fine, so you see the 20 day moving average is coming up to it and it closed around 190.
NEUT11|So I'm looking for that.
NEUT12|Also continue next week to take out the highest rated air created one 9281 is the current high.
BULL13|I'm expecting this to continue to move higher to get to at least 200 before it starts to try to back down again.
BULL14|We have the Christmas rally more than likely generated to continue an.
