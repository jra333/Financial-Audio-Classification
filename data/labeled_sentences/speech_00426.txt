BEAR0|"""Investors have been pouring into that."
NEUT1|As you know, along with gold.
NEUT2|The question is where does it go?
NEUT3|From here?
NEUT4|Let's bring in Scott Nations of Nations indexes Bill Baruch of Blue line futures.
NEUT5|Scott nations fundamentals.
NEUT6|Are they on silverside?
NEUT7|They absolutely are.
NEUT8|This is the perfect environment for all the precious metals.
NEUT9|You can't say that very often with negative real interest rates, and so even I got long precious metals recently.
NEUT10|And Scott, you really can't say that.
NEUT11|Very often.
NEUT12|We've talked about that on the show, but the fundamental picture is going to change now because we know what the interest rate situation is and the rest of the fundamentals have to help silver along because the rest of the world is reopening again.
NEUT13|We know what the interest rate picture is going to be going forward.
BULL14|So, absent some substantially better fundamental news, I think Silver will continue higher, but it's going to be a grind higher and it will be solely because of the interest rate situation and the technicals.
NEUT15|From your perspective, Bill.
NEUT16|We love silver and gold at Blue line futures, but here's what you gotta know is you cannot chase yourself around in this stuff.
NEUT17|You got to pick your spots seasonally, silver and gold.
NEUT18|Cool off as we head into September and into the first half of December.
NEUT19|And then when this market moved and ripped higher, a lot of enthusiasm behind it.
BULL20|But as you can see in the chart, it hit a big 50% retracement psychological resistance at 30 bucks.
NEUT21|What I need to see right now is I need to see a pullback.
BULL22|$23.00 is where I want to be a buyer and if it stays above 21, I think that's constructive.
BULL23|"Lays groundwork to see a breakout above $30 in the first half or the first quarter of next year."""
