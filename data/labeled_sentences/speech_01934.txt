NEUT0|"""Guys, there were some pretty interesting comments yesterday from Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger."
BEAR1|He sounded the alarm on the spec craze at yesterday's Virtual Annual meeting for the Daily Journal, which is his other company.
NEUT2|He was answering shareholder questions via Yahoo Finance Live Stream and in it the 97 year old Monger made clear that he is not a fan of all this pack speculation.
NEUT3|I don't participate at all, and I think the world would be better off without them.
NEUT4|I think this kind of crazy speculation in enterprise is not even found or picked out yet is a sign of.
NEUT5|Of.
NEUT6|Irritating bubble, it's just that the investment banking profession will sell as long as it's going to be sold.
NEUT7|The things we beeped out that was the investment bank will.
NEUT8|So another word for it or Joe the word you use a **** Sue.
NEUT9|They'll be selling Shih Tzu as long as Shih Tzu will be sold will be bought.
NEUT10|Munger also took issue with Commission free trading on the platform.
BEAR11|Robin Hood saying that the momentum driven trading frenzy is in his words, regrettable.
NEUT12|Robin Hood trades are not free.
NEUT13|When you pay for order flow, you're probably charging your customers more and pretending to be free.
NEUT14|It's a very dishonorable, low grade, way to talk and.
NEUT15|And nobody should believe that Robin Hood's trades are free.
NEUT16|Munger also equated Commission free trading with what he called disgusting lies.
NEUT17|What else did he take issue with?
NEUT18|Well, Bitcoin?
NEUT19|As you might imagine, Charlie Munger is not a crypto buyer.
NEUT20|I do think that a properly run bank is a great contributor to civilization and the central banks of the work were like controlling their own.
NEUT21|Banking system and their own money supplies.
NEUT22|So I don't think Bitcoin is going to end up.
NEUT23|The medium of exchange for the world it's too volatile to serve well as as a medium of exchange and.
NEUT24|It's really kind of an artificial substitute for gold, and since I never buy any gold, I never buy any Bitcoin and I recommend that other people follow my practice.
NEUT25|In fact, regarding Bitcoin, he quoted Oscar Wilde on foxhunting.
NEUT26|He said it's the pursuit of the uneatable by the unspeakable, and in terms of what the Daily Journal will be doing.
NEUT27|He said that they will not be following Tesla into Bitcoin.
NEUT28|Probably not a surprise.
NEUT29|Munger has said that he really would have gotten into this for a long time.
NEUT30|I think he called it rat poison a couple of years ago.
NEUT31|He is 97, but his comments guys just on what he sees on Wall Street.
NEUT32|What he talked about with the specs, what he thinks in terms of.
NEUT33|What's being sold by investment bankers right now?
NEUT34|Pretty clear spoken as he always is.
NEUT35|Charlie says what he thinks and has no problem getting out there.
NEUT36|You know, he was really on fire yesterday.
NEUT37|Watched this for two hours, him taking questions and he's quick.
NEUT38|He was speaking exactly how he thinks about things and he was pretty colorful along the way.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
