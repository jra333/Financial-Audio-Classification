NEUT0|"""Hey everybody crypto Mentor 99."
NEUT1|How you doing?
NEUT2|So this is going to be just a quick video.
NEUT3|I haven't posted one of these in awhile, but the past week or two.
NEUT4|Well, last week in this week.
NEUT5|I've been doing a little trading.
NEUT6|And when I.
NEUT7|Normally this week when I would do a trade and last week I would do the video the same day and say this is what I did today.
NEUT8|This is the percentage that I made so.
NEUT9|I didn't do any videos.
NEUT10|I didn't trade Monday.
NEUT11|And Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I did.
NEUT12|Today I'm in a trade that I'll get out Monday or Tuesday, but there's a trade that I was in and I've been talking about the airline stocks.
NEUT13|In the video or the description box below.
NEUT14|Video number one is going to be airline stocks.
NEUT15|Take a look at that.
NEUT16|That video is more long term, but I did a little day trade.
NEUT17|That I wanted to share with everybody.
NEUT18|Wednesday March to 25th.
BEAR19|As you know, the airlines are getting pounded.
BULL20|But for me that's good.
BULL21|'cause that creates opportunities.
NEUT22|And I didn't know what the stimulus package.
NEUT23|Again.
NEUT24|I'm not a professional investor, I'm at home.
NEUT25|I'm trying to make good use of my time and make a couple of bucks, so I wasn't sure.
NEUT26|Well Wednesday.
NEUT27|The stimulus package was supposed to be signed Thursday, and then Thursday it was finally signed on Friday the 27th, so I didn't know how that would affect if the stock would go up if they were tank again.
NEUT28|I'm not a professional investor, but I wanted to tell you about a trade.
NEUT29|That I was in and out of in a couple of hours so March 25th Wednesday.
NEUT30|I bought some American Airlines at $16.11.
NEUT31|I think that was in the morning as I remember maybe around 10:00 o'clock.
NEUT32|You could double check me on that for those that want to Fact Check me, but I was in at 1611.
NEUT33|And I think I had to go somewhere Wednesday afternoon, so I didn't want to have the trade go overnight.
NEUT34|So I sold at 1634.
NEUT35|In it's $16.11.
NEUT36|Got out at $16.34.
BULL37|Not a huge profit, about 1 1/2%, but I was happy with it.
NEUT38|Anyhow, I've been talking about the airline stocks and I just wanted to let you know that I'm actually doing.
NEUT39|And putting into practice what I'm doing videos about.
NEUT40|Anyhow.
NEUT41|Crypto Mentor 99.
BULL42|"Thanks for being part of my crypto family and yeah, you know I love you see you later bye bye."""
