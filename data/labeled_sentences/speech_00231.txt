NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up you guys?"
NEUT1|I want to update on Plug Power stock.
NEUT2|Currently it is sitting at 3660.
BEAR3|The day before yesterday it did sell off pretty hard, but it did bounce off of the support level.
NEUT4|I was watching 33 dollar level.
NEUT5|This acted as a support.
BEAR6|We also try to get above this 37 resistance and it did close and today it was holding up nicely but one overall market dump dumped this stock took a hit as well and it came down.
NEUT7|But volume there wasn't too much of a panic.
BEAR8|Selling volume was pretty low, so people are chilling anything until Mark Ideal Company gets back with the legit news.
NEUT9|What's going on with their accounting?
NEUT10|I think this stock is going to move sideways for now.
BULL11|And also if we zoom out the daily chart we can see we're sitting well above trend line.
NEUT12|Which is this green line.
BULL13|And also we are we are above this support line as well as 33 I was watching.
NEUT14|34 extreme sell off, but these are the two support levels.
NEUT15|Still I'm watching and also to the upside, if this stock tries to go higher, I would expect this gap to get filled between 42 and also 30 pretty much 40 to 42 in this gap right here that was created.
NEUT16|These gaps that were created to the upside.
NEUT17|These get filled, but to the downside I think this gap may get filled.
NEUT18|This is the only thing I'm watching today.
BULL19|Upside maybe possible push towards 4250 in the next for the rest of March.
BULL20|Maybe if company gets back with news that they haven't made significant mistakes with their accounting.
NEUT21|I definitely seethis.com back up to testes 4747 fifty levels OK so and also look at this look at this volume.
NEUT22|Look at this huge volume after selling off same day next day.
NEUT23|Look at this huge volume so it could be a lot of shorts who covered their short positions and also some dip buyers who came in to buy this stock.
NEUT24|So that's what's going on with the chart and let's have a look at the options.
NEUT25|If we take a look at the option stats for Thursday, it's only for one day, I couldn't.
NEUT26|And watched yesterday what happened with option market, but today so far 86,000 call volume 50,000.
NEUT27|Put volume an let's have a look at some long dated what's going on with some long dated contracts, March 19th.
NEUT28|These are short term speculative plays.
NEUT29|Now there's one big call for June 18th.
NEUT30|$60.00 call 500 contracts.
NEUT31|So this is standing out around like over a little over $100,000.
NEUT32|But, and there's another one right here, same date, same strike Price 60.
NEUT33|Call an also.
NEUT34|What else out there?
NEUT35|I'm seeing another 60 call right here for June 18th.
NEUT36|There's there's decent short medium term, medium term.
NEUT37|Pretty much bets to the upside, so not much overly bearish bets.
NEUT38|I would say there's one that is standing out right here for next year.
NEUT39|$20 put, but it's only 150 contracts so this is around like $50,000 bet.
NEUT40|But I'm not seeing too much of a bearish activity for this stock so we can chop around until as they set.
NEUT41|Company comes back with some legit news and then we'll see which way the stock is going to move.
