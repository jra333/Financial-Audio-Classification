BULL0|"""Well, good morning, Steve, Jeff and Karen."
BULL1|Thanks for having me on today.
NEUT2|That's the question, isn't inflation, and I think that Steve is a perfect test tube for the experiment.
NEUT3|As to how this is going to play out in both the economy and in people's minds, because perceptions are more important than reality.
BEAR4|So if Steve goes to the petrol station and it cost him more to fuel up his car and more to heat up his home, then he thinks he's experiencing inflation.
NEUT5|And if he does that, he might ask CNBC for a higher wage.
NEUT6|If he does that, he might accelerate a purchase of a big ticket item to beat higher prices in the future, and he might behave as though there's inflation and that's what I think is the big concern right now.
NEUT7|The UN anchoring of inflation expectations and I think Jeff you had an important point there an important element in inflation are wages and people getting higher wages during the time of still very high unemployment and still a lot of slack in the economy.
NEUT8|That would be a sign that inflation process has begun.
NEUT9|But we see no indication of that whatsoever.
NEUT10|What we see is that reception of inflation being fueled by energy prices.
BEAR11|Brent crude Brent has gone from 30% lower than a year ago, as recently as N29 percent higher than a year ago.
NEUT12|Right now, that's what Steve's feeling at the pump.
BULL13|And that's going to be 100 and 2% higher than a year ago.
NEUT14|By the time that we get to March in 140% higher than a year ago, by the time we get to April.
BEAR15|So people like Steve, we're going to continue to complain.
BEAR16|About the prices of things at the pump, they're going to say we're experiencing inflation.
BULL17|We're going to see maybe as much as two and three quarter percentage points added to headline increases in CPI.
NEUT18|Headline inflation rates in the eyes of people, but all increases in the CPI are not inflation and this is not inflation.
BULL19|And this basis effect an increase will work out of the numbers by the time we get to the end of the year, we're getting back to normal from a depressed base.
NEUT20|We're not in a room anywhere close.
NEUT21|"To where inflation true inflation is insight."""
