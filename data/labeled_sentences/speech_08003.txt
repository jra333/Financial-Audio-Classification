NEUT0|"""So Dan and I were on deck for some very big tech, our names and if I'm still alive and you can still hear me, what are you paying attention to?"
BULL1|Yeah, I we have a slew of earnings.
NEUT2|It's basically the apocalypse for someone like me who covers tech.
NEUT3|It's Apple, Amazon, Google, and Facebook.
NEUT4|They're all going to be reporting today when I'm looking at specifically is Apple.
NEUT5|How many iPhones it sold in the quarter as far as the prior generation?
NEUT6|We're not going to get a lot of.
NEUT7|Info on the current generation the twelves were gonna get mostly from the elevens and whether or not people were still buying whether or not there is a boost for sales.
NEUT8|For things like Mac and iPad as a result of pandemic spending and then you know how it overall did in services with subscriptions for things like Apple Music, Apple TV and then for Google and Facebook.
NEUT9|Obviously the big question is going to be how big was advertising impact and from the look at it for how Pinterest and Snap have done as far as advertising people are expecting.
BEAR10|Bank blowout performances from both of these firms for that.
BULL11|So there's high expectations on both sides for there.
NEUT12|And then Amazon.
BEAR13|Obviously, the impact from people still continuing to spend through the pandemic as well as Prime Day spending.
NEUT14|I think those are really going to be the big stories for the day, and I just want it to be over.
BULL15|"Damn Ali, thank you."""
