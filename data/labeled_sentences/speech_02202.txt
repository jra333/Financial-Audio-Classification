NEUT0|"""OK, people want us to look into Cody, thought some coding COTI."
NEUT1|Our bill, could you pull that up?
NEUT2|And 1st as well if you like.
NEUT3|So I mean, Cody is a decent project.
BULL4|Actually, winners of are quick to roll to event in Tel Aviv, and they've come a long way.
NEUT5|We actually had the the founder on for an interview last year as well.
NEUT6|When they launched their VIX index in crypto.
NEUT7|Definitely worth looking into another project.
NEUT8|I'm personally invested in and I don't have any plans to invest in per say, but what they're doing is definitely something I think of value.
NEUT9|OK, so very interesting.
NEUT10|I can tell way back when the last time we charted this that I notice this stop start feature.
NEUT11|Stop Start Stop, Start Stop start is usually a prelude to a moon shot.
NEUT12|It actually did do a moon shot up to $0.58.
NEUT13|If you look more gradually at it, the question is do you want to buy the dip?
NEUT14|I think you might want to buy the dip if it gets back to $0.29.
NEUT15|That was the area where it kind of took off from.
NEUT16|In the meantime, it looks like you have profit takers active.
NEUT17|So here's how I operate with these things.
NEUT18|Have already mooned.
NEUT19|Profit takers come in.
NEUT20|They take their money.
NEUT21|And the question is, does that crush price?
NEUT22|So when you see these type of candles where it rushes up and then comes back down.
NEUT23|OK, like.
NEUT24|It's happening right now as we speak.
NEUT25|It means that you know sellers are out there.
NEUT26|So let the sellers get done what they're doing and take it down to support at $0.29, and then if you get that final washout then it can go back up.
NEUT27|So, and even if it's, it's still.
NEUT28|If sellers are taking their money and can't push it lower, it means there are buyers out there.
NEUT29|So this is 1 case where the answer is kind of, it depends.
NEUT30|Right, I think if you like this coin, buying it on a dip to thirty cents makes more sense.
NEUT31|Alright, thank you Bill.
