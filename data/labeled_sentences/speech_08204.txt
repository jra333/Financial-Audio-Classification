BEAR0|"""Is there reason to believe that this addition could cause even more worries about this dreaded fiscal Cliff and headwinds for stocks?"
NEUT1|Louis Alexander is chief US economist at Nomura.
NEUT2|He joins us right now.
BULL3|Lewis is great to have you with us.
NEUT4|Will we actually see this?
NEUT5|Do you think that this impact is enough to actually see this translated in any way in terms of the economic data or in terms of the stock market?
BEAR6|Look, I think going forward, what you're going to see highlighted is the differences between the two parties over fiscal policy, and I think inevitably that's going to raise investors concerns about how the fiscal Cliff is going to be dealt with.
NEUT7|It's going to depend on how it plays out on the campaign, but I think that that is going to bring forward the markets concern about what we're going to see after the election.
BEAR8|So marginally negative for the stock market.
NEUT9|For equities, is what you're saying, I think.
BEAR10|So I agree with one of your earlier comments as well that I think it means the ultimate outcome may be a more fiscally conservative one, and I think that does mean slower growth in 2013.
NEUT11|Hey Louis, it's Brian Kelly.
NEUT12|I'm liking you already, 'cause I'm the one who said that comment.
NEUT13|So I was.
NEUT14|I was going to ask you about it for you then.
NEUT15|Louis, my question for you.
NEUT16|Luis is how much does this change the calculus on the Obama side?
NEUT17|Do you think they actually do maybe portray themselves as being a little more fiscally conservative to try to pull in some of the middle vote?
NEUT18|Look, I think they're going to have to stress those themes.
NEUT19|Anyway.
NEUT20|Look, my view is is that?
NEUT21|I think they've always been fiscally conservative in the long run.
NEUT22|I think they are committed to that, and I think they're going to have to stress that more, and I think ultimately the outcome we're going to get next year is going to reflect that.
NEUT23|But getting back Louis to the core, either of the Ryan plan or what you expect, I think what Brian is talking about.
NEUT24|I think what you've mentioned is this sounds a lot more like EU austerity than it does a world where actually, you know we're going to find a way and Republicans find their way to actually.
NEUT25|Stimulate and you know, this is a little bit confusing for folks.
NEUT26|Yeah no, no look.
NEUT27|I think that's exactly the right point.
BULL28|I think the argument that we could use some more investment in key areas like infrastructure.
NEUT29|I think that's going to get lost in this debate, and I think the.
BEAR30|Net effect of this when we come to making decisions about spending in 2013 is probably going to be more negative than would be optimal for the economy.
NEUT31|We do need to deal with the long run issues, but that doesn't necessarily translate into what we do right up front and what I'm concerned about is, you know this debate with.
NEUT32|If you look at the Ryan budget, it's much more conservative in the early years.
NEUT33|That's where we're going.
BEAR34|"We're going to move in that direction ultimately, and I think that's negative for 2013."""
