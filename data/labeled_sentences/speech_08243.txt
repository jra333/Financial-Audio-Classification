NEUT0|"""Lead tech analyst at Jefferies Brent welcome."
NEUT1|We have seen Facebook shrug off assaults from a variety of things over the years.
NEUT2|This time feels a bit different.
NEUT3|It doesn't sound like you believe it is.
NEUT4|Why can Facebook prosper even in what could be a much more highly regulated environment for these companies?
BULL5|Yeah, thanks for having me.
NEUT6|Facebook today has 200,000,000 small businesses on the platform.
NEUT7|10 million advertisers on the platform.
NEUT8|So there's just simply a huge divergent in terms of those that are using it for free and they can pay.
NEUT9|And when you look at what's happening with Facebook shops to let small businesses get found, it is a material opportunity to let these communities thrive while we're all working from home.
NEUT10|So while there's a lot of negativity, focus on these platforms, we think there's a lot of good that's happening, right?
BULL11|Out of this whole ability to shift to Commerce, we're also seeing, uh, we believe $15.00 of earnings power a couple years out.
NEUT12|If you put a 20 to 25 multiple on that, you're getting to 300 to $375 share price per share an with the stock where it's at.
NEUT13|We still think that there's upside.
NEUT14|I think last year no one expected Cove at Amazon was our topic last year.
NEUT15|We think it's good to switch it up.
NEUT16|We like the Facebook position.
NEUT17|We like the negativity that typically works and regular regulatory does not scare us away.
NEUT18|Having covered Microsoft for 20 years at.
NEUT19|$30 we told investors to ignore what was happening with the EU investigation that regulates regulatory overhang.
NEUT20|Obviously didn't really mean anything in the stock.
NEUT21|Had a huge move.
NEUT22|But your job Brent is to analyze risk an you know that I don't want to get in the weeds about this section 230.
NEUT23|Basically there's been some talk that they want to Congress would like to make it so these companies are indeed publishers held to the same standards as newspapers for the country.
NEUT24|Say no, it's not us, even though it's on their platform.
NEUT25|If Congress were to classify a Facebook, Twitter and others as.
NEUT26|Publishers, what would happen to their valuations and their prices?
NEUT27|I think right now there's a lot of trust being given back to social media as they're blocking a lot of this.
BULL28|My trust level of going to Twitter now and going to other platforms improves, so I think ultimately what happens is the regulators are trying to help all of us as consumers.
NEUT29|The companies want to provide an innovative technology.
NEUT30|There's a middle ground.
NEUT31|I'm a bully.
BULL32|I'm a believer that we will find a middle ground that will appease to both sides.
BULL33|These companies are growing up and again through all the regulatory pain.
BULL34|We've seen new highs across all of tech.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
