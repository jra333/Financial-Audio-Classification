NEUT0|"""I'm Jon Najarian from Market Rebellion and I've got Peter Lynch, Anne Netflix."
NEUT1|How do these two cross?
NEUT2|I'll tell you about it.
NEUT3|I thought we'd talk a little bit about the Peter Lynch theory now.
NEUT4|If you don't know him, he's of course the legendary money manager for Fidelity, and Peter Lynch always said invest in what you know.
NEUT5|In other words, if it was a mom and she was going to the supermarket and she was buying a lot of General Mills products, maybe she wanted to buy some General Mills stock.
NEUT6|The same applies during this COVID-19 shutter in place order that we are all living through right now.
NEUT7|What are we all doing?
NEUT8|We're spending a lot more time on line and we're spending a lot more time watching streaming media.
BULL9|The big winner here has been Netflix NFLX wise that well number one.
NEUT10|They already had a huge base.
NEUT11|100,000,000 people already had Netflix before this got started and they are growing at 100% in just a two week.
NEUT12|Can you imagine that if you go from 100,000,000 to 200,000,000?
NEUT13|Unique users hitting your site.
NEUT14|That's what Netflix did folks.
BULL15|That's why the stock jumped from $350.00 to $450 in four trading days.
NEUT16|So Peter Lynch theory if you're watching a lot of Netflix, maybe you want to own some of that stock.
NEUT17|"And I am John Najarian from marketrebellion.com."""
