BULL0|"""Meantime, the economy, as you probably know by now, the jobs number in July, nearly 1.8 million new jobs added above expectations will talk about that, with Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius, who's number Jan was pretty much in line, certainly given some of the alternative data, and ADP and the ISMA employment component, which gave some pause."
NEUT1|Why were you not dissuaded by those?
BEAR2|Well, we thought it was going to be weaker than the.
NEUT3|You know then then what we printed gob.
BEAR4|Basically because of these these weaker alternative numbers, the high frequency indicators, the claims numbers really until yesterday had been pretty disappointing, so that was was pointing to a slowdown.
BULL5|You know, I think today's number is encouraging.
NEUT6|Overall, you know relative to the to the expectations, but of course we also have to see.
NEUT7|This is a somewhat dated number, and we'll, we'll we'll see in the Aug report.
BULL8|How well job growth is holding up in the face of the renewed restrictions on on activity.
BULL9|If you look at the share of states that are opening versus restricting activity, there's obviously been up in a sizable shift, and that's probably going to be visible in the August number as well.
BEAR10|Alright, is it too simplistic to argue that the the seeds of re employment, meaning the places that people could potentially have a job to go back to are still intact, and that that's the most encouraging takeaway from a number like today's?
BEAR11|"Yeah, I think that is the most encouraging way to look at it, and I'd point out that the share of unemployed workers that are on temporary layoff is still close to 60%."""
