NEUT0|"""OK, now we're going to take a look at what makes a stock price change."
NEUT1|Obviously things that happen overtime cause psych prices tend to rise.
NEUT2|As we saw, we looked at our 10 year difference when we looked at Whole Foods Market.
NEUT3|We're going to look at now is we're gonna look at Land's End, which is a clothing manufacturer so you can see currently is trading at $44.02.
NEUT4|But what I want to look at and what I notice when I looked at their graph, is that I notice that there's a big change from one day to the next in the stock price.
NEUT5|And I can actually see how much that that stock price change if I put my little cursor on the bottom, I can see that at the end of trading on September 9th, Linzan stock was trading for $33.34 and then the next day it opened ads.
NEUT6|Or does it look like?
BULL7|It's looking like $37.32, so we're looking at a $4 jump in the price of the stack.
NEUT8|So when I'm trying to figure out what could possibly have happened to take a look at that, I see all these letters over here, which correspond to different stories that you can see on the right that have to do with Land's End stock.
NEUT9|So what I'm going to do is take a look at some of these stories and you can see that I have a number of them right at the same time, which is usually a good indicator that something happened.
BULL10|So if I look at story E. It tells me lands and shares up sharply after strong quarter assez Land's End posts.
NEUT11|Quarterly results story.
NEUT12|Jay tells me.
NEUT13|That's.
BULL14|Land's End post profit of $11.8 million in the second quarter, which is probably better than what they were anticipating.
BULL15|And it also says, in Story G, lands and profit rises 4.9% on stronger sales.
NEUT16|Now the way that financial analysts work, they're always making estimates and about what they expect companies to do.
NEUT17|It's kind of like if you went into class and you were expecting AB.
NEUT18|If you gotta be, then it really isn't a big deal.
NEUT19|'cause that's what you were expecting.
NEUT20|But it's a big deal if you come in at an A or if you come in at a C and that's really what happens to prices of stacks when companies come in different from what the analysts are expecting.
BULL21|Since land at Land's End had more sales and were stronger than expected, their stock price jumped $4 from one day to the next.
BEAR22|Now on the other hand, if you have a company that has poor sales and their expectations are worse than what the analysts were expecting, then you would tend to see a big drop off in the stacks.
NEUT23|Race now, in addition to things about earnings and profits, other things that can cause prices to jump are releases of new products or maybe bad news about a product or a lawsuit or something like that.
NEUT24|So when you're looking for a stack, make sure that you kind of look at the chart and you see if you can see any sort of big jumps.
NEUT25|I would probably not go back further than a month because your stories aren't going to go back that far, so hopefully you can find 1.
NEUT26|Maybe you may want to take a look at a sack like say, Macy's, 'cause that one I think has a little bit of a drop it somewhere in there.
NEUT27|And also you may want to take a look at Apple 'cause Apple just had a an announcement about a new product, so we'll see if that had any sort of impact on their stock.
BULL28|"Good luck."""
