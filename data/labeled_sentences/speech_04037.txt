NEUT0|"""Let's quickly just look based on Q&A."
NEUT1|There's some interest in whether or not Netflix is breaking out is certainly formed.
NEUT2|The right side of this base very well, and you can see pattern.
NEUT3|Rick identifies a nice little handle buy point here.
NEUT4|Test peoples metal as it broke out here, but then came back strong and noticing this.
BULL5|This pullback is still above the 50 day, but looks like we're.
NEUT6|Very close to the left side, high over here.
NEUT7|He's got to it.
NEUT8|We got to it actually.
BULL9|Yeah, just a little bit.
NEUT10|So 3 three 8632 yes indeed.
BEAR11|So if you take $0.10 above the left side high three 8609, you're nominally above that volume.
BULL12|Seems to be strong so far.
NEUT13|It's only 20 minutes into the session.
NEUT14|Scott, your thoughts?
NEUT15|There's just so much merchandise out there, right?
NEUT16|I don't hate Netflix, but you know, my Cup is runneth.
NEUT17|Over is.
NEUT18|You know you can't have a mall, and so it's just not on my screen.
NEUT19|I think there's you know better merchandise right or wrong, but it's yeah, there's just a lot of options out there.
BEAR20|You know, I I. I was hoping the market would get slammed today.
NEUT21|That some of these stocks would you know, set up even more.
BEAR22|It's kind of a, you know, ulterior of thinking.
NEUT23|But if you're, you know if you're if you really want to get into some of this stuff, you really want some type of consolidation.
BULL24|So yeah, Netflix is a great company.
NEUT25|Great product, but I I'm.
NEUT26|I'm on the other fish.
BULL27|Very good, it seems like they really are making a comeback after the Disney Plus threat here.
NEUT28|Look at these numbers.
NEUT29|It's hard to complain and one thing to know if you're a bull and Netflix, you gotta be happy with the fact that their their international non US growth is really going gangbusters.
BULL30|"That's that's what's really contributing to a resurgence in the fundamentals."""
