NEUT0|"""I want to get your thoughts on that ISN manufacturing number today and where you fall in this debate that might just highlighted, well, it's a very important fact that this really started falling with the trade war began to escalate in the middle of last year."
BEAR1|So the big question is, has so much damage is already been done by the trade war that this is going to continue to go down.
NEUT2|Is this driven more by if there is a change in the sentiment in the trade wall?
BEAR3|Unfortunately this point when we below 50 years might just mention that is recession for the manufacturing sector, so we're watching very, very carefully for any signs that this is spilling over to the services sector.
NEUT4|Manufacturing is just.
NEUT5|About 10% of GDP, 10% of employment.
BEAR6|So broadly speaking, it's not good news and the trend is not our friend in this data.
NEUT7|When you talk about watching the signs, what are the signs that you're watching most closely?
NEUT8|And what would I guess change from it?
NEUT9|Being just purely a manufacturing recession to one that's more broad based, yeah, so it's absolutely employment, so we'll see ADP tomorrow.
NEUT10|We'll see in on payrolls on Friday.
NEUT11|That becomes very critical for any signs that this is indeed spreading out to not only being an issue in terms of manufacturing, but we also already seeing in the data today the new export orders.
BEAR12|Has been coming down and that is a very leading important leading indicator.
BEAR13|Also for I said where the coming months, so that's also pointing to more slowdown.
NEUT14|Unfortunately, in the manufacturing sector, so to what extent is monetary policy the cure?
NEUT15|So the problem is that if you ask her how do we deal with trade policy, interest rates is not the most obvious answer.
NEUT16|So in that sense, even lowering interest rates a little bit here a few times there are a lot of question marks about what can that do to stem the slowdown we're seeing.
BEAR17|So in some sense it really is 2 very different forces that are set in motion here, so we're getting more and more worried about the downside risks and also the risk that if it may have to cut more than just a few insurance cuts, we could talk about exports here.
BEAR18|But compared to some of the other economies that have been showing.
BEAR19|Signs of weakening and slowing, not as export driven of an economy as, say, Germany or China.
NEUT20|So I guess how much can US growth continue?
NEUT21|I'll be at a slower pace even if you see those markets slow.
NEUT22|Even more markedly that's right.
BEAR23|I mean, Germany is already at the brink of recession.
BEAR24|Japan has had a very sharp slowdown.
BEAR25|China obviously has also been slowing.
NEUT26|So the question is, with the rest of the world slowing so much, can the US released and its own exactly as you say?
NEUT27|I mean, exports are relatively small.
NEUT28|Share of GDP.
BULL29|So so far US being a closed economy is helpful.
BEAR30|But broadly speaking, we are worried also in the labor market data and the employment report would be watching on Friday for any fears that the service sector is also beginning to slow.
BEAR31|And we're seeing some signs of that which makes us somewhat worried about the broader economic picture.
BULL32|Is there a sense that, let's say, a rollback of the tariffs, and let's say some gestures between the US and China of trying to work toward a deal that it could quickly turn business sentiment enough that these things could reverse?
NEUT33|Or no, it may help in markets here, but I think the problem is that they, I mean, sentiment.
NEUT34|Among businesses is really the most important issue here in terms of do they believe that this is at the end of the trade war, or they worried that maybe this will actually come back?
NEUT35|Is this just versus China?
NEUT36|What about the trade war with Europe and Japan?
NEUT37|There's just a lot of issues around that specific question that maybe markets would like it in the short term, but we're a little bit worried that this is not something you just can brush aside very quickly from a business sentiment perspective, it's awesome.
BULL38|Thanks for joining us.
BULL39|Great to see you.
BULL40|"Thanks for having me."""
