NEUT0|"""JPMorgan, pulling in the risk trading activity triangle safe in the wake of the London Whale trading to tell us about it."
NEUT1|David Benoit Deal Journal Blogger.
NEUT2|So I guess we kind of knew this was coming, but my guess my real question is OK, so JP Morgan, they're going to sort of pull in the risk activities that this Chief Investment Office takes.
NEUT3|Yeah, exactly especially big deal.
NEUT4|Is this incrementally, it's important.
NEUT5|It shows their responding.
NEUT6|I think.
NEUT7|I think it's there.
NEUT8|You know they're both going to increase the risk management and kind of say hey, you guys shouldn't be trading some of these things.
NEUT9|Essentially what it is is they're not going to trade in very kind of light traded derivatives, and they're going to avoid private equity.
NEUT10|Really trying to not be a whale in the market, you know, that was part of the problem with this trade.
NEUT11|They went really big on something that no one else was really in.
BEAR12|It left them kind of exposed yes.
BEAR13|And then when the losses started piling up, they couldn't get out of it.
NEUT14|What I thought was most interesting in the story.
NEUT15|Is this whole thing about how the risks that they were taking within this unit are?
NEUT16|And again, they said this was a hedging unit, right?
NEUT17|This was just some extra money.
NEUT18|They used it kind of Springer, hedge their risks.
NEUT19|The bets at this unit were taking were bets that none of the other big banks were doing?
NEUT20|Yeah, that that's very interesting, right?
NEUT21|So essentially, I mean when this first happened came out in April, Jamie Dimon kind of said, along with calling a Tempest in a teapot, is something everyone does.
NEUT22|This is how banks work.
NEUT23|And it turns out really, the other banks that have all these deposits that they need to figure out what to do with don't invest it in the same way that JP Morgan about it, and that's certainly kind of adding to the clamor around this.
NEUT24|I mean, it makes you wonder what exactly was that unit doing?
NEUT25|What was its purpose within the company?
NEUT26|You can see the six month chart their JPMorgan stock, you know they've had.
NEUT27|It's quite a chart that downturn is on the loss came out.
NEUT28|Yeah, downturn right?
BEAR29|You can see that downturn in April when the loss came out they've suffered.
NEUT30|I think it was 17 billion in market cap.
BEAR31|They've lost on this, but losses on that radar 2 billion and counting, right?
NEUT32|We don't.
NEUT33|We think about five is about what we don't know yet.
NEUT34|No no.
NEUT35|But I mean, what was this units purpose within the company?
NEUT36|What were they really do?
NEUT37|Yeah, I know Diamond was at the congressional testimony last week and he kind of, you know, got a lot of kid glove questions anyhow.
NEUT38|But I mean what?
NEUT39|The the What is the proper role for a unit like this within a bank like JP Morgan that is government subsidized.
BULL40|It does get a taxpayer support.
NEUT41|What is the role of this unit?
NEUT42|Why is that unit doing it when none of the other big banks are doing right?
NEUT43|Well, here's JP Morgan's argument is essentially that.
NEUT44|We have a lot of deposits.
BULL45|Our Chief Investment Office has been very successful at doing what it's doing.
NEUT46|I think there definitely is room for debate about whether it's a hedge or whether it's propagating or what's going on, but.
NEUT47|The unit has been pretty successful until this one trait, and that's kind of JPMorgan one $2 billion loss trade, you know.
NEUT48|And again, we just met with them when they lost the money there was.
NEUT49|There was nothing really going on.
NEUT50|This is what you have to keep in mind.
NEUT51|There was nothing really going on in Europe.
BULL52|Things had calmed down.
BEAR53|They lost $2 billion in a relatively benign environment.
NEUT54|What's going to happen if Europe eats up?
NEUT55|"That's the question we have to leave it there though."""
