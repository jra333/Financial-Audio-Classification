NEUT0|"""Everyone and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So we're going to talk about AMC Entertainment.
NEUT2|Obviously this is a stock that a lot of people are interested in.
BULL3|We definitely want to invest, especially Windows short squeeze, because right now it just continues to drop its tanking very fast.
NEUT4|We've seen this before.
BEAR5|If we look at this for the past month, yes and see how you know it's been going up and it's crazy because after a huge spike that literally happened like in a few like in one week, we saw go up to like $2021 and then it just dropped.
NEUT6|And obviously this happened because Robin Hood was restricting us from being able to buy anymore shares, and you were only allowed to sell.
NEUT7|So that kind of ***** right?
BEAR8|So you know it started dropping and then it started to go back up slowly this time, but it did reach like around $15.
BEAR9|Now it's dropping back down and there's a couple of museums need to understand why it's dropping.
NEUT10|Is it still time to invest or not?

BEAR18|The link will be down below so AMC OK. One thing I need to understand is is it's tanking very fast.
NEUT19|OK and we're looking for that short squeezes and you can see at the moment you know we really haven't seen any like huge squeezes right now, but it's going to happen very soon.
NEUT20|OK, but the reason why it's dropping this one thing?
NEUT21|OK, AMC first of all they finally they're going to reopen.
NEUT22|I believe.
NEUT23|It's March 26 all around the US.
NEUT24|Some names he's already open here in California where I live.
NEUT25|An you know I love AMC man the theater short of amazing you know the screen is you know it's a big size.
NEUT26|The seats are very comfortable.
NEUT27|I love AMC right but they were supposed to go bankrupt back in January.
NEUT28|There was supposed to announce it because imagine a whole year and you know the they needed help right?
NEUT29|So they were going to go bankrupt but you know the whole meme stock happened where AMC started going up.
NEUT30|We were all investing on ready everything like that radius or you know that that's what started going up and now slowly going back down but now going up and then once again dropping now.
BEAR31|And there's two reasons why you hear the first one is because it dropped 50% yesterday and today continues to drop.
NEUT32|Disney announced that there's going to be 2 movies that are going to be released, but the only problem is they decided that it was like, hey, you know what?
NEUT33|I think we're also going to stream it.
NEUT34|You know, in our site as well, even though it's going to in a way be out in movie theaters and that doesn't make sense, right?
NEUT35|Like we want to watch in the movie theaters.
NEUT36|You know, we can.
NEUT37|But like why streaming?
NEUT38|You know it's like they want that extra money in Disney, right?
NEUT39|So they said over here doesn't see the first ones going to be Black Widow, which is something that's going to come out I believe on July 9, which is summer and then the second one was going to be Cruella, which is, you know, basically the villain.
NEUT40|They go back to the Joker, you know we're finally going to see the point of view of the villain for 101 automations, which is really cool.
NEUT41|I'm excited about that and then you guys can see that now, AMC, you know they're trying their best.
BEAR42|It's that's not good for the company that was already struggling, so you know with this whole thing going on and then they're not doing so well performing.
BULL43|We're definitely going to see a short squeeze very soon.
NEUT44|If it continues to drop this fast, so let me know what do you guys think about this?
BULL45|Hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT46|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys on my next video."""
