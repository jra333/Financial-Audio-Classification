NEUT0|"""It's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol P LTR."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the the obvious but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but very impressive move on this one when you think about the fact that the stock gapped down went down a little bit lower to right there and now has managed to fight all the way back up to where it has very impressive move.
NEUT5|But that doesn't have the valid question of but is there any sort of true power behind this president?
NEUT6|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT7|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT8|And I have no idea.
NEUT9|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward in my mind or falls on a single area, and that area is down here at 2175.
NEUT10|Why is 2175 important?
NEUT11|I'm not saying all this.
NEUT12|What's going to actually happen, but if the price were to come down in 2175, behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would that be doing at the price?
NEUT13|That would quite literally be put in the price.
NEUT14|Right back inside of that area, where it just wasn't, I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power to strength or anything like that.
NEUT15|But to be fair, no price can just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here.
NEUT16|Behave in that manner and then start to work the way back upwards.
NEUT17|Now all of a sudden what you have?
NEUT18|Well, you'd have a set of Lowe's.
NEUT19|Right there you have these loads down there, and if you envision each one of those stairs steps well, hey, there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's an in the game.
BULL20|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT21|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 2175 in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT22|Main battleground to watch can be right there.
NEUT23|That purple line there, the 50.
NEUT24|Moving average current value of that as well.
NEUT25|Just call it at the $23.00 mark.
NEUT26|But All in all, any angle you look at it.
BULL27|Very nice movement today.
NEUT28|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
NEUT40|Totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT43|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT44|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
