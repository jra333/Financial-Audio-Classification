NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, microinvest are here so I want to take a second."
NEUT1|I want to talk about.
NEUT2|Disney in.
NEUT3|And the purchase of 21st Century Fox.
BULL4|Now this deal is huge and this is a big deal for Disney.
NEUT5|It was originally tried to get in trying to acquire this for about for a little over 50 billion, and now they're looking at spending over 70 billion.
NEUT6|And that's because Comcast is trying to bid on too, but Disney has a lot more to lose if they don't get this.
NEUT7|Because what this gives them is.
NEUT8|Is as we know, Disney did acquire Marvel Studios a while back ago, but Marvel had.
NEUT9|Add salt, turmeric, Seaford.
NEUT10|Disney purchased Marvel and so Fox had dead Pool, X-Men Fantastic Four.
NEUT11|So.
NEUT12|Disney will get those rights back, or you know, they'll get their ownership of those to make those movies.
NEUT13|And that will allow them to enter those universal Marvel.
NEUT14|But it also gives them the distribution rights to the first six Star Wars movies.
NEUT15|He purchased Lucasfilms but 21st Century Fox owns it.
NEUT16|It should be distribution rights to those six Star Wars films.
NEUT17|And there's a lot more than just Disney and Marvel.
NEUT18|Fox has Avatar, they have Simpsons, Family Guy and all bunch of a bunch of shows and.
NEUT19|Disney is already, you know, put in Avatar into their theme park so.
NEUT20|The I mean that's that would make that better for them.
NEUT21|Yeah, I'm not sure if anybody has talked about it, but Disney and Fox.
NEUT22|Odd do you own a majority stake in?
NEUT23|And to Hulu, so that would give Disney 60% of Hulu, which means they have majority of the power there.
NEUT24|They will also have 40% of the box office.
NEUT25|And a large part of the content.
NEUT26|That is on Netflix.
NEUT27|Now I think in General Disney stock is a good stock to buy no matter what, but if this deal goes through.
BULL28|I think that the value of Disney will go up a lot more.
NEUT29|Disney is a genius with marketing and branding and they can do a lot more with the properties.
NEUT30|At 21st Century Fox owns if they have it in their hands.
NEUT31|And I know Disney has is wanting to offer their own streaming service.
NEUT32|And I know they're going to do a lot more with Hulu if they're going to.
NEUT33|The majority share of it, so I think there's a lot going on with Disney, and it's definitely a stock worth getting to now, and it's definitely going to be.
NEUT34|It's definitely going to be on sale right now.
NEUT35|If they do end up acquiring 21st Century Fox.
NEUT36|So just to keep this video short.
NEUT37|That is, that's in this video.
NEUT38|Please subscribe.
BULL39|"Thank you for watching."""
