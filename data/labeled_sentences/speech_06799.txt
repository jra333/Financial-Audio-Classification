NEUT0|"""What's up traders?"
NEUT1|Just wanted to give you guys a quick warning about the levels we closed at yesterday.
NEUT2|The 1st of April.
BULL3|We pretty strongly rejected on this resistance line.
NEUT4|That was made on the.
NEUT5|What was it worth?
NEUT6|March 10th and.
NEUT7|March 15th it pretty much perfectly bounced off of that.
NEUT8|And then came back down to the exponential exponential moving average.
NEUT9|I can't even speak.
NEUT10|The.
NEUT11|Yeah, the email I I have that 15 in it it didn't even hit it but it was pretty close.
NEUT12|If it bounces off that, that's going to be really bullish sentiment, but.
NEUT13|We don't always want to just hope for the best.
NEUT14|We want to look for the.
BEAR15|The negatives too.
BEAR16|So it could possibly break below this and stay below this if it holds below this point.
NEUT17|Here they were most likely going to be going back to this support line that I drew on the.
NEUT18|March 5th and March 30th.
BULL19|Those connecting for a support line and it's still pretty close to the overall yearly support I have here.
NEUT20|And it's it's really following that.
BULL21|Well, just above this yearly support and yearly resistance.
BEAR22|So yeah, if it breaks below this point, it's going to come back down somewhere along this line.
NEUT23|Most likely, and that's going to be a very good buying point and then.
BEAR24|But if it does bounce off of the emmalina, it's most likely going to break above this resistance and then.
BULL25|Hopefully breaking above that resistance would break above the 700 that we've been having a lot of trouble getting back over.
NEUT26|So yeah, that's it for me.
NEUT27|Just a quick warning update.
NEUT28|"On, just be prepared for both directions."""
