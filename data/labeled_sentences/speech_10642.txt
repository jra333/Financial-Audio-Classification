NEUT0|"""Let's start with Pool Corp, America's leading wholesale purveyor, pool, parts, supplies and maintenance equipment."
BEAR1|This was a double whammy.
NEUT2|1st Pool cops Corp. That's an obvious code, beneficiarii.
NEUT3|I mean, you really want to take a chance at a public swimming pool.
NEUT4|In this environment, millions of Americans are stuck at home, and if you got the space, there's never been a better time to get your own pool.
NEUT5|Second, even though yes and I'm conscious, it takes costs a lot of money.
NEUT6|That's not the point of the piece though.
NEUT7|Second, even though the economy is in rough shape, we've got ultra low interest rates, and that's part of booming home building.
NEUT8|You better believe some of those new houses will have swimming pools.
BULL9|We know poops doing well because they gave us a break Bush business update at the end of May with a big demand for maintenance supplies in Pool construction components.
NEUT10|My own concern here.
BULL11|Stocks already had a massive right now it's at 40% for you and it just broke through $300, making another new all time high today.
NEUT12|And that's an issue because poop reports this Thursday.

NEUT17|Some exotics event by more.
NEUT18|Next up one of my absolute favorite is Tractor supply TSC.

NEUT20|You might not know these guys if you live in the city, but this is the Premier farm and ranch retailer that's especially essential for gardeners like I am.
NEUT21|And I say that I am a part time gentleman Farmer right now.
NEUT22|Gardeners are thriving because it's yet another covid safe hobby.
NEUT23|Lately, tractor supplies become one of the best stories of retail.
BULL24|Like Poolcorp, it's got a big boost from a very positive business update at the end of May, the tractor supplies update was a lot more specific and a lot more bullish.
NEUT25|Imagine told us they turned 245 and 265 per share in the second quarter and we're looking for $1.77.
NEUT26|That is used when that thing was wallowing around 60.
BEAR27|6070 also like poolcorp, these guys report on Thursday morning, stocks had a monster run surgeon from 111 nearly 1:45 next couple of months and let's keep raising the price targets.
BULL28|We got two more boots this morning from Stevens and bared my view trying to gain this quarters of mugs.
