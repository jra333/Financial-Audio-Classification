NEUT0|"""My name is Sam Barnett."
NEUT1|I'm 22 years old and I just graduated from Caltech after my sophomore year.
NEUT2|I founded a company called SBB Research Group to apply and develop mathematical strategies to invest in the stock market.
NEUT3|I studied applied math at school, but I've been interested in numbers since I was just a little kid.
NEUT4|I also always enjoyed playing games and competing.
NEUT5|I've competed in tennis and karate for most of my life and my competitive spirit combined with my interest in numbers made finance my perfect playgrounds.
BULL6|The best part of Caltech was working with incredible teachers and brilliant students.
NEUT7|Not only were my friends gifted in their own fields, but also curious about other disciplines.
NEUT8|This enthusiasm for learning and open mindedness really inspired me to take a different approach to study patterns of finance.
BULL9|In particular my roommate Riley encouraged me to take class in his area of expertise.
NEUT10|Computer science.
NEUT11|Without Riley's insight, it would not have developed the skills they need to transition my ideas in mathematical finance.
NEUT12|Into a computerized system for predicting the stock market.
NEUT13|After experimenting with and refining my algorithm, I decided to launch a hedge fund with money from investors.
BULL14|After a year, these investments gained over 18%, a lot better than the S&P 500 return of only 1% during the same.
NEUT15|Also, I believe in protecting my investors from losses, and I'm proud to have achieved these returns with about half the volatility recipe 500 even more so, I'm proud of the team that is, join me over the last two years with backgrounds in math, computer science, chemistry, physics and engineering as well as finance.
BULL16|"I feel like we have the kind of interdisciplinary collaboration that I valued so much at Caltech."""
