BEAR0|"""Crowdstrike yesterday."
BULL1|This now Maureen has done so well its market cap basically rivals that of Symantec which is decades older.
NEUT2|Crowd Strike has 5% of the revenue that Symantec has.
NEUT3|Does this start to feel frosting to you?
NEUT4|These reactions.
NEUT5|It's tricky and I've talked to a lot of investors and bankers about this and they say someone, I mean the growth is ahead of them.
BEAR6|They're selling so little of the company.
NEUT7|That's another another issue.
NEUT8|I mean, it's for tech companies they're selling about as little as they have on record historically.
NEUT9|Yeah, so.
NEUT10|Scarcity value exactly.
NEUT11|I've set up as well, but it is.
BEAR12|I mean, it could potentially start looking overheated, but again, investors are discriminating.
NEUT13|We're not seeing this in Uber.
NEUT14|We're not seeing this and lift true and Leslie at the same time.
NEUT15|I mean, this is what Jim Cramer was talking about this morning as well.
NEUT16|It's not like cyber security, which is crowd strike had been that hot of a place.
NEUT17|I mean, we all remember when Hack was the ETF of the year and that was like five years ago.
NEUT18|Alot of these publicly traded names hadn't even done that well.
NEUT19|So why do you think you know?
NEUT20|Again, same question before we go.
NEUT21|Why is it that these IPO's?
BULL22|Are attracting so much interest in doing so well at least early on.
NEUT23|I think a lot of it is investor psychology and the fact that they're seeing a lot of these deals work.
BULL24|We've had 13 deals this year that are up more than 50% on their first day 5 zero, 50% on their first day of trading, so investors see that and they say you know what?
NEUT25|I may not really know what something like this does, and the fact that there can parables are also down in the market, but this is worked for me in the past, so I'm going to keep doing this until it stops working because it's clearly generating Alpha as you mentioned.
NEUT26|"With the Renaissance ETF."""
