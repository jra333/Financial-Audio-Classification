NEUT12|All right Next up we have Pod Insulin Corporation.
NEUT13|This is video number 10 of 19 of the upgraded stock series.
NEUT14|To watch from the beginning, click on the link in the description down below.
NEUT15|Right?
NEUT16|Let's get into it.
NEUT17|Pod PODD is the stock symbol.
NEUT18|Insolent Corporation ascentia Lee.
NEUT19|They develop, manufacture, and sell insulin delivery systems for people with insulin dependent diabetes.
NEUT20|If you're not aware.
NEUT21|There are millions of people across the globe with insulin dependent diabetes, so.
NEUT22|Unselect Corporate Corporation was in 41 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020.
NEUT23|You all time high for that statistic is 44, so that's huge.
BULL24|Pod has seen an increase in support from the world's most elite money managers.
NEUT25|There were 38 hedge funds in the database with pot Holdings and at the end of September.
BULL26|We pay attention to hedge fund sentiments because research has shown that select group of hedge funds holding outperforms even the S&P 500 by 124% points since March 2017.
NEUT27|Russell able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund Holdings that significantly underperform the market and stay away from those so.
NEUT28|This stock in itself.
NEUT29|Awesome catalyst is far as the insulin insulin delivery systems that they develop.
BULL30|Financially they are making money earnings per share $0.10 a share PE 2648 which is very high.
BULL31|Technically, we've got a beautiful upward trend here.
NEUT32|Taking a look a little bit closer.
NEUT33|It's very like.
NEUT34|Gappy stock likes to gap up likes to gap down a lot, so I would put it more on the risky side of things.
NEUT35|I'm going to say a buy target of 240 to 260, so anywhere between.
BEAR36|Here at this base where there's a nice support here at 2:40 all the way up to 260 current price target 265 would be looking for a bit of a pullback with a price target sell on this at 320, which is about 60 to 80 points, which is very nice.
NEUT37|But I like this one.
NEUT38|I like this talk a lot.
BULL39|"I think it's a good upgrade we'll see on the next one."""
