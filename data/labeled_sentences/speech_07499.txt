BULL0|"""Welcome back to low cap gems."
NEUT1|Today, we're talking about an OTC stock ticker symbol.
NEUT2|TSX F Tech X Technologies, Inc. Light Link Technologies will go through their website and talk a little bit about them.
BULL3|Basically, they're up about 30% today at $1.70 per share.
NEUT4|Their market cap now will be around.
NEUT5|Yeah, be about $75 million after today and their shares outstanding are about 71.3 million, so pretty low shares outstanding and their float doesn't give you the float, but so pretty low shares outstanding.
BEAR6|An interesting stock and it's up 30% on a day when a lot of things are either down a little bit or down a lot because the market is having trouble finding direction which is annoying for everyone that's involved.
NEUT7|Hopefully we go bullish, but even if it went bearish, we just find a direction that be nicer for everyone to know how to play their positions.
NEUT8|For this one specifically.
NEUT9|Yes, basically a technology company that works in the crypto blockchain, AI and Internet of Things space.
NEUT10|So crypto related technology related, it shows their team has a pretty clean website, has a couple of companies in their portfolio, you can contact them if you need.
NEUT11|It's secure, has 2021 on there so those are things you look for on the website as far as the team.
NEUT12|Yes, always look for stuff that has like under 100,000,000 shares in OTC is pretty solid and I always look for market caps that are under 100,000,000 and I love to find him when they're still under like 25 million.
NEUT13|Those are some of the best ones I've played.
BULL14|Like if you look back at rocket Fuel that we called about 10 days ago that ones up over like 300% since we called it.
NEUT15|That's the interesting company.
NEUT16|Rocket fuel blockchain.
NEUT17|Look into that one as well.
NEUT18|Yeah, the team for this one is Peter Green Zara, Michael LM&J and they all have different companies like J.
NEUT19|He was part of cattle exchange which generates over 300,000,000 USD.
NEUT20|Peter, the CEO, he's helped like different companies go public and just a lot of money.
NEUT21|She is are as good at like accounting so you'd like to see that they're fully transparent.
BULL22|This is better than most of the OTC stocks.
NEUT23|It's out there.
NEUT24|An ultimately, let's type of things you're looking for, at least like a website that shows their team.
NEUT25|What they do really clearly has under 100,000,000 shares outstanding in a market cap.
NEUT26|This, under 100,000,000 in the right sector with a clean chart, and that has the possibility to actually give you a return.
