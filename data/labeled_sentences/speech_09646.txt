BULL0|"""Well, Elon Musk is now the richest person on the planet, surpassing Jeff Bezos with a net worth of 180 point 588.5 excuse me billion dollars."
NEUT1|Bloomberg Wealth Reporter Devin Pendleton is here now with more Devin, how did this happen so quickly?
NEUT2|Well, is it really all due to Tesla?
BULL3|Tesla have had this absolutely incredible 2020.
BULL4|The stock was up 743% last year.
BULL5|Musk is of course the biggest Holder task of Tesla, so that has really just pushed him up and up and up the wealth rankings.
NEUT6|He had an interesting response to this today.
NEUT7|He tweeted how strange and well back to work.
NEUT8|What is Elon Musk's relationship with personal wealth?
NEUT9|Yeah, he hasn't really unique relationship.
NEUT10|I would say unlike a lot of billionaires on our wealth ranking, so of course might have a big equity stake in a company.
NEUT11|But they also have a significant amount of cash.
NEUT12|Must really has most of his wealth tide up just an equity of his company.
BEAR13|In fact, he's even complained in the past that he's cash poor, which is kind of a crazy thought that thinks that this man who is now the richest person in the world, actually doesn't claims to have had at times not enough cash to fulfill his basic needs.
NEUT14|But he's got a lot of interest in possessions and belongings of last year.
NEUT15|He said he was actually giving away all of his physical possessions, including some of the mansions he has.
NEUT16|And he really said that most of the capital he's accumulating he wants to just plow into this endeavour to colonize outer space essentially.
NEUT17|Yeah, so how much?
NEUT18|How much?
NEUT19|How much does this help SpaceX?
NEUT20|Significantly, I imagine, although he of course doesn't have a lot of cash from this stock ascent of Tesla right now, so it's not clear exactly how he would use his appreciated pencil stuff to fund SpaceX, but presumably it would be positive.
