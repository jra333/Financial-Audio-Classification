NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments where I post daily videos analyzing various stock price movements and important price levels."
NEUT1|Watch out for.
NEUT2|In this video I'm going to be talking about New Inc ticker symbol in IO.
NEUT3|So let's get started.
BEAR4|Currently Neo is trading at $44.29, which is 1.34% drop from yesterday's price.
NEUT5|The market is still open.
BULL6|We're now in power hour, so it was an interesting day for new.
NEUT7|If we look at the technical indicators, you could see in the magazine they two moving averages are converging and we're almost at the crossover.
NEUT8|But we're not there yet.
NEUT9|And keep in mind this could change.
NEUT10|So as we can see what happened back in February 19th where the Magdi was looking like it's about to reverse and the crossover almost happened.
NEUT11|But as you can see it never crossed and will continue to.
NEUT12|On the down trend, it doesn't mean it will happen this time, but it's always something to watch out for.
NEUT13|So one important thing to watch here, and I've been watching for the past few days for us to become bullish on Neo.
NEUT14|We needed to cross above the 20 email line over here, the red line and.
BEAR15|Over the past few videos, I said if that doesn't cross, we're going to be running flat, and as you can see here, we're still trading sideways.
NEUT16|Yesterday we had the test of that price around the 4650.
NEUT17|An it got rejected and it retraced back down.
NEUT18|So as long as we stay below 4650.
BEAR19|We're going to be trading sideways at the least, if not slightly to the downside, and if I enable some lines in the last video was talking about this downward trend line, and it's also aligned with the 4650, so we need to break in order to breakthrough this trendline.
NEUT20|And have a bullish movement.
NEUT21|We need to crossover this trendline and we need to cross over 4650.
BULL22|If that doesn't happen, then we're probably going to be trading sideways and possibly get the $40.60 requested, which is a support line shown by the pink line over here.
BULL23|If that holds, then will bounce off that and get 4650 retested again.
NEUT24|However, if they $40.66, fails.
NEUT25|Then we're going to see it trace down to the 38 level where we have another support level.
BULL26|So if I just draw it over here, Sir, on the $38.00 we have another support level.
NEUT27|So on the upside, keep an eye on 4650 on the lower side, keep an eye on $40.66.
BEAR28|If that doesn't hold, we're going to trace down to $38.00.
NEUT29|I'll post an updated video later this week.
BULL30|I hope you found this video helpful, as usual.
BULL31|"Thank you all for watching and see you in the next video."""
