BULL0|"""Hi, it's Sandy Bush economist and moving by clients from cast of confidence to make better decisions for their businesses."
NEUT1|And I'm out walking around in the snow and just outside of Chicago.
BEAR2|It's a little cold today, about 27 degrees, but I've been thinking about what a crazy year 2019 was for the economy.
NEUT3|If you think about it, we started 2019 with the US government shutdown.
BEAR4|We had a full blown trade war going on between the US and China and we had the US stock market down nearly 20% from its peak.
NEUT5|Today the US government is open and a budget agreement has been made to ensure it stays open until 2021.
BULL6|We have the US, China, US in China likely to sign a trade agreement next week and trade tariffs are being reduced and will likely also have the USMC a passed by the Senate in January after the impeachment trial of President Trump and the US stock market has been setting all time highs.
BEAR7|Now that is a huge shift if you think about it, the S&P 500 had a 40% swing from September 2018 just to March of 2019.
BEAR8|And really it hasn't looked back since, and we're ending the year almost the exact opposite of last year.
BULL9|Think about it, we have totally reduced down uncertainty of a recession.
BULL10|We've reduced down uncertainty of a trade war, an impeachment unemployment.
BEAR11|It's very low, and wages are rising to lowest income earners.
BULL12|And that's faster than the higher income earners.
BULL13|And that's really good news.
BULL14|The S&P 500 is on track to be up 28% for the year.
BULL15|Really its best year since 2013.
BULL16|And that's great news for everyone.
BEAR17|With a 401K or an IRA or any kind of stock Holdings from work or personal investing, interest rates have been cut three times in 2019 and their their lowest levels in years, which definitely helps anyone borrowing a home, a car, or anything else look 2019 started out as a bear, but boy did it end up as Obolon.
NEUT18|Wow, do we have challenges for 2020 economic, political and technological challenges are all facing us.
NEUT19|An laughing at us right now, but these will have to wait until tomorrow as I want everyone to enjoy tonight.
NEUT20|But not too much.
NEUT21|"Tomorrow we'll talk about the problems I'm anti Bush economists wishing everyone a safe and happy New Years."""
