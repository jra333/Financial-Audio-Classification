NEUT1|February 22nd.
NEUT2|In today's BN Geo stock analysis and predictions, not too late to buy.
NEUT3|Be NGO.
NEUT4|Alright, let's get started.
NEUT5|Bionano genomics.
BULL6|NASDAQ, be NGO has certainly created a buzz in 2021.
NEUT7|It's one of the top 100 most popular stocks on Robin Hood.
BEAR8|Bionano's shares have skyrocketed more than 340% so far this year.
NEUT9|With such a massive gain in such a short period, it's natural for investors to wonder if perhaps they've missed the boat.
NEUT10|Is it too late to buy Bionano genomics stock?
NEUT11|The primary argument that it's not too late to buy Bionano stock focuses on the long term prospects and those prospects could be outstanding.
BULL12|The company's technology is impressive.
NEUT13|It's sapphire genetic sequencing system can detect large structural variations that others can't.
NEUT14|Sapphire looks at variations in up to millions of DNA base pairs, a capability that is crucial in researching some diseases.
BULL15|The company is pretty much in a League of its own in its niche market of digital cytogenetics.
NEUT16|The detection of genetic disorders by analyzing the differences in chromosomes.
NEUT17|Bionano estimates that its market opportunity is between $2.6 billion and $3.8 billion annually.
BULL18|Let's assume that Bionano manage is to attain the lower end of that range.
NEUT19|The average PS ratio for the biotechnology industry is around 8:00.
NEUT20|Based on that multiple, it's possible that Bionano could be worth more than $20 billion.
BULL21|If it can capture a big chunk of its addressable market, that's a lot of room to run.
BULL22|I've mentioned in the past that I really like bionano's technology, and I think there's another reason the stock could move higher over the short term.
BULL23|The short interest in Bio Nano has increased any good news from the company could fuel a nice short squeeze, but it's concerning to me that Bionano's current valuation represents more than 90% of what the company estimates is the upper bounds of its addressable opportunity.
NEUT24|Sure, the average PS ratio for the biotechnology industry is 8, but that multiple is so high because the stocks have tremendous room to grow.
BULL25|Bionano's share price already has much of its potential growth baked in.
BULL26|I'd like to see Bionano demonstrate that it can generate strong revenue growth.
BULL27|It would also be great if the company expanded its total addressable market through innovations and acquisitions.
NEUT28|My view is that it might actually be too early to buy Bio Nano stock.
