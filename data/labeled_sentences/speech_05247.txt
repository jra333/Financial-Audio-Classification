NEUT0|"""Hello friends, that's the conclusion of the week."
BULL1|I hope you had a good one and here's to a better weekend.
NEUT2|This is Netflix and I am charting Mandan of the chairguys.com look down in the scription of this video.
NEUT3|You will see a link to our website.
NEUT4|We are offering a 10 day free trial.
NEUT5|We're rolling out our new feature of the live webcam.
NEUT6|We have pre market analysis everyday at 9:15 and we periodically check in to capture live action as it unfolds.
NEUT7|We also are hanging out in the chat room looking to answer any technical analysis questions and making videos to help guide you on your path to becoming a more profitable trader or investor.
NEUT8|This is Netflix on the daily timeframe.
BEAR9|We had a pullback that we were expecting.
BULL10|Netflix was number 2 on our.
BEAR11|Pullback Watchlist we had three days in a row now of lower highs and lower lows.
BEAR12|That's a sure sign of a little bit of a downtrend.
BEAR13|Resistance was on the Upper Bollinger band One 2693 and the low of the day was bought up a bit off of 122 fifty support.
NEUT14|So from here we have the 10 day moving average support at 1:15 thirty seven.
BULL15|It is likely we see a little bit more consolidation.
NEUT16|In my opinion.
BEAR17|We do have decreasing volume so this could be a little bit of a.
NEUT18|Bull flag forming.
NEUT19|Just a break.
NEUT20|A little pullback and then continue higher.
NEUT21|Netflix is one of those stocks as everybody knows it is on everybody's minds and everyone's talking about it so we'll see just how much hype can do for this.
NEUT22|Stuck in the bulls.
NEUT23|Looking at Netflix on the weekly time frame.
BEAR24|We closed just below the Upper Bollinger bands.
NEUT25|That level is resistance at 123 sixty.
BULL26|You can see the little upper Wick here, showing the profit taking and the Bulls perhaps stepping in still a beautiful uptrend.
NEUT27|RSI is not going to stay above 70 forever.
NEUT28|There will be consolidation where this ten week moving average support is tested that support is 102.
NEUT29|Fifty one is just a matter of time so I would air on the side of caution with Netflix as it stands looking at the weekly chart and the daily chart.
BEAR30|Not much more room on the weekly chart without breaking above the Upper Bollinger Band, which would take a significant amount of bullish volume and seeing a little bit of consolidation.
NEUT31|So that's what we're looking at for Netflix.
