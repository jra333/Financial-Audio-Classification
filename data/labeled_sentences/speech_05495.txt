NEUT1|More upside for Palantir?
NEUT2|Alright, let's get started Palantir.
NEUT3|PLT ER is a big data company with two established verticals, government and commercial.
BULL4|Palantir was in a great space of deep value returns a few weeks ago.
BULL5|The company is very attractively priced at 36 X it's 2021 revenues indeed.
BULL6|Not only is Palantir expected to grow at approximately 35% wife wide growth rates in 2021?
BULL7|It has very high profit margins.
NEUT8|Also, Palantir has minimal need for cap ex requirements that just one percent of revenues.
BULL9|Meanwhile, compared with a close pier Splunk, SPL K Palantir outperforms its peers in every metric despite both trading with somewhat similar market cap, Palantir reported its first report as a public company, having invested in newly listed companies.
NEUT10|I know that the first quarter is critical, as it's very telling about a company's medium term prospects with the accounts dressed up for its listing.
NEUT11|What bad news comes out during these first results?
BULL12|Moving on my bullish thesis here is squarely focused on the combination that Palantir has very long term contracts, implying huge visibility ahead with steady growth.
NEUT13|As you can see above, on average Palantir's average duration is 3.6 years.
BULL14|That implies very little in the way of negative surprises for Palantir.
BULL15|It will be just ticking along, growing at close to 35% overtime.
BULL16|If you are able to buy into the company at a reasonable multiple, as it presently trades at more on this later, you can expect a rewarding return eyeing up strong cash flows from operations.
NEUT17|Another aspect that positively attracts me to this stock is that it has minimal needs for cap, ex.
BULL18|Capitalization of intangibles to grow its revenues in the above 2 graphics you can see the Palantir's investment in Cap.
NEUT19|Ex is roughly mid teen millions despite tying up more than $1 billion in revenues.
BULL20|In other words, its CapEx requirements are roughly 1% of its revenues, undoubtedly impressive.
BEAR21|Palantir's outstanding stock will end up at roughly 2.2 billion compared with 900,000,000 outstanding at this moment.
NEUT22|Thus, investors should think of its market cap is roughly $50 billion and should not put too much consideration on the fact that it's bottom line was very negative.
NEUT23|Due mostly to stock based compensation being charged to its income statement, indeed palanti is non GAA.
BULL24|P gross profit margins for Q3 2020 will up 1100 basis points.
NEUT25|Wife why 281%?
NEUT26|Furthermore investors should I up.
BULL27|It's $133 million of adjusted operating income for 2020, putting its operating income margin at close to 13% for 2020.
BULL28|Once again an improvement from its trailing nine months of just 11%.
NEUT29|However, one appraises this investment.
BULL30|We can see that Palantir is steadily improving its profitability profile towards 13% margin.
BEAR31|Once we get past it's nonrecurring stock based compensation associated with its direct listing.
