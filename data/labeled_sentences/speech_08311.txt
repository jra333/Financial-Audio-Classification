NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Glenn this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well a very impressive day today.
NEUT4|Now the Fed meeting of course played a role in that buy from the technical point of view.
NEUT5|I mean good stuff here.
NEUT6|Pulled back and I mean you could throw this right into a textbook.
NEUT7|Look right where the price found support right at that pink line, which I know I've talked about before the 200.
NEUT8|Moving average.
NEUT9|And that's why it's a very famous area within the world of technical analysis.
NEUT10|When sideways right there and then.
BULL11|Of course, with the meeting made a nice move up from that area.
NEUT12|So really, in my mind now there are two main levels that really stand out.
NEUT13|The first level just talked about it at 200.
NEUT14|Moving average, which you know is going to be considered at main and very important level of support.
NEUT15|Current value of that pink line right over there you can see.
NEUT16|Now let's just call it one 2250.
NEUT17|So from the support side of things one 2250 remains that very important level of support that you're going to watch moving forward.
NEUT18|And then as far as the resistant side of things really.
NEUT19|2 main level stand out.
NEUT20|The first level is going to be that initial hurdle that will need to be cleared.
NEUT21|And that's it's right here at essentially $126.
NEUT22|If you go through the history of the chart, you can see again, generally speaking, not to the exact penny, but generally speaking presented a problem.
BEAR23|Try to bounce up there, presented a problem, big move here presented a problem.
NEUT24|So 126 is going to be the first key battleground.
NEUT25|And then if the price can push up through that 126 mark, the next level would be 127.
NEUT26|And if the price can actually get up to 127, that would be put in the chart right back on this trajectory that it was on an you know could very well.
NEUT27|You know, percent it back up into the potentially one 30s.
NEUT28|Depending on just how strong and how you know higher volume.
BULL29|Those areas are when they're broken, but overall pointer being very impressive, bounce off that level of support, not just a question of is this balance can be strong enough to start to push it up through these near term levels of resistance.
NEUT30|Let's see how the next couple of days play out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT43|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT44|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT45|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
