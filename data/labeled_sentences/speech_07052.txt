NEUT0|"""Sarah, you don't see everybody finally saying you know what, not even taking my phone."
NEUT1|I'm going out I'm going outside.
NEUT2|I'm not going to be on any type of electronic device for the next three days.
NEUT3|That's not when we reopen.
NEUT4|That's still not going to happen.
NEUT5|No, I think people are going to lean into their phones just as much into richest point.
NEUT6|The apps and the companies that rely on people being out and about are going to soar.
NEUT7|You'll recall about a year ago, this time, all these big travel companies like Expedia and Trip adviser.
BEAR8|They yanked their ads, spend off of Google and Google's advertising outlook plummeted because it.
BULL9|I actually think Google is going to benefit enormously because you're going to see people start to travel.
BULL10|People start to use these apps that advertise on Google, so they're going to do very well.
BULL11|There's also a new report out this morning about Amazon doing really well.
NEUT12|You know analysts think they had about $15 billion in AD spend last year.
BULL13|They're going to continue to riches point to bring in all of those e-commerce advertising poles, so they're going to continue to do really well.
NEUT14|I think people will still lean into their phones.
NEUT15|I think the question to your point, though, is, are people going to sit at home in their living rooms and watch a lot of streaming TV look?
BEAR16|I don't think streaming is going away, but I don't think people are going to binge this same level that they have been, and so that might impact the stock like Netflix just a little bit.
NEUT17|That's a point rich.
NEUT18|I don't know.
NEUT19|I might go out for a week then I'm going back in and watching something.
NEUT20|I think I look.
NEUT21|I think the big change has been Joe.
NEUT22|If you look at kind of what consumers have done over the course of the last couple of years is they've been moving further and further away from linear TV.
NEUT23|And I think there's no more.
NEUT24|You know if you're looking for what is sort of the the big event that we've all been waiting for, right?
NEUT25|The NFL, which you know, made a big decision a few weeks ago that they're going to move Thursday Night Football over to Amazon.
NEUT26|And you look at all of the companies.
NEUT27|I mean, Peacocks, going to be simulcasting.
NEUT28|Sunday Night Football.
NEUT29|Paramount Plus is going to be simulcasting Sunday afternoon football.
NEUT30|I think the reality is streaming is here to stay and it's replacing linear TV and I think that shift now that even sports is getting into it.
BULL31|The traditional bundle and cord cutting we're going to hit record levels of cord cutting in 21 and 22 and it's going to benefit all of these streaming companies as they really lean into more and more content.
NEUT32|And Netflix is going to spend 17 and a half billion on content.
NEUT33|This that's what I mean.
NEUT34|See Sarah.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
