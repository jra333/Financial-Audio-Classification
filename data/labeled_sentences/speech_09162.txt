NEUT0|"""Tesla buying 1 1/2 billion dollars worth of Bitcoin."
BULL1|Sending the price of Bitcoin to a new record above 44,000 for the first time we want to bring back in Dan Roberts.
NEUT2|For more on this and and we were talking last week.
NEUT3|A lot of that though was more focused on Doge coin.
NEUT4|When it came to Elon Musk and there was lots of questions about how serious he was when he came to the crypto market.
NEUT5|But this of course is a massive move not only for Tesla but it's huge for the crypto industry as well.
BULL6|That's right, Sean, and probably bigger for Bitcoin than it is for Tesla.
NEUT7|You mentioned last week when we were talking about Elon Musk tweeting about doge coin.
NEUT8|The mean based cryptocurrency, he cautioned in a live chat on clubhouse that his tweets about doge coin are jokes, but this is no joke.
NEUT9|I mean, this is really must getting serious about crypto.
NEUT10|This is the biggest single by of Bitcoin from a public company ever.
NEUT11|Of course, MicroStrategy, which is also publicly traded, holds more Bitcoin than Tesla, but has done it in recurring buys over the course of time.
NEUT12|Tesla doing this 1.5 billion worth in one swoop.
NEUT13|It's just so interesting.
NEUT14|It also amounts to 10% of Tesla's cash reserves.
NEUT15|And just to put that in perspective, you guys remember when we discussed back in October how notable it was when Square by $50 million worth of Bitcoin, that was just one percent of Square's cash reserves.
NEUT16|So Tesla really going in here and I would add the fact that the SEC disclosure says that Tesla hopes to eventually accept Bitcoin as payment for its products.
NEUT17|That could be the bigger news here.
NEUT18|Now, of course.
BULL19|That being said, as bitcoins price rises.
NEUT20|I don't think people want to spend it, so you know, we talk about PayPal, which is also about to allow people to purchase in crypto.
NEUT21|As the price goes up, no one actually wants to spend their Bitcoin.
NEUT22|They want to buy it and hold it as an investment, but very interesting move.
NEUT23|"And I interpret this as really must getting serious going from joking tweets to putting his money where his mouth is."""
