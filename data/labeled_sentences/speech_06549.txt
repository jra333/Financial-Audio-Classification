NEUT0|"""Welcome back everyone to accept channel into these technical analysis video for Monday, January 11th."
NEUT1|I'm Christina Bertha need investment analysts taking look at gold in the daily chart.
BULL2|Well, we had a great start to the year last week with the price rising above the five month old descending channel.
BEAR3|But the 61.8% Fibo Nachi and November is peak at 19165.
BEAR4|Proved to be tough to overcome all the way up keeping the downward pattern from the 2079 her record time place or Friday we had another negative development.
BEAR5|The market came under a stronger selling pressure or breaking the ascending trendline and falling back into the channel and also the price registered and you six week low to 18117.
BEAR6|Earlier today we can see that the 200 day moving average is trying to keep downside movements under control for now, will technically the risk is still skewed to the downside given the size and make these bears location, the stochastics are also sloping downwards and the written consent line is set to cross below the Blue Kingdom.
BULL7|In line so negative momentum may hold in the short term, though, whether we can reach the 1700, nineteen 17164 supportive area that may depend on the 200 day MA where the 23.6% one out of 837 is also placed.
BEAR8|If the 200 day Ma gives way in the price closes below 17164, then the downtrend may register first low somewhere between 745 at seventy 115th and near the bottom of the channel.
BEAR9|It's also worthy to note at this point that the distance between the 50 and 200 day moving averages continues to narrow.
NEUT10|Keeping the case of a trend deterioration open.
BULL11|Knowing the positive scenario, an upside reversal may push for a close above the channel and towards the 50% Fibonacci of 19120, her breaking the 2050 day moving averages as well as the 38.2% Fibonacci of 883 on their way up.
NEUT12|Nevertheless, such an upturn wouldn't be very exciting to the market.
BULL13|Unless the metal print prints a higher high above November's peak of 965.
NEUT14|So that's all for gold today.
BULL15|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
