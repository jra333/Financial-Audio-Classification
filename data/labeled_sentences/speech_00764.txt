NEUT0|"""Hi, it's Adam Hughes and I'm coming to you from market clubs digital down in the stock were looking and analyzing right now is Apple Computer."
BULL1|As you can see we've had a wonderful run up starting in January all the way up to close to 192 and almost a $200 a share.
NEUT2|That would be what we want to do today is analyze why the market fell and how far it fell and how you can tell how far markets going to fall or rally.
NEUT3|That's a very cool lesson so stay tuned.
NEUT4|We'll take this off the screen.
NEUT5|This little drawing and I'm going to put a fib annachi number in here.
NEUT6|You click up here on Market Club.
NEUT7|And it creates a little X you click on the very high, which is right around here and you click on the low point right here.
NEUT8|Now you see how this draws this one 5220 level, which is pretty much where the market turned around and had this nice impressive $25 rally from that point.
NEUT9|Why did it stop here?
NEUT10|Well, this is a very important Fibonacci number, and if you're not familiar with Fibbonaci's.
NEUT11|Retracements, you really should get to know we have a special lesson for you in just a few seconds, so stay tuned now.
BULL12|The markets rallied.
NEUT13|So what's going to happen now?
NEUT14|So I'm going to scope this in just a little bit further so we can get a much clearer picture.
NEUT15|We're using Japanese Candlestick charts.
BULL16|As you can see, the market got very close to getting a bottom here and then the market rallied very nicely over to the 177 level.
NEUT17|So let's just take this off the screen.
NEUT18|Take our fibbonaci number off.
BULL19|And we're going to put another fibbonaci line in again, going from very high.
NEUT20|To the very low point, and as you can see, I'll scope this in even further, so you can very clear you can see that the retracement.
BULL21|From the break, which is from here down to here, back up to here was exactly 62%, which is pretty much where the market is going to have resistance, and it's obviously pulling back today one 7258 and we expect to see this market in a trading range.
NEUT22|And retesting these lows so it's possible.
NEUT23|When that happens, we'll see this market begin to build a base to go high, but right now it's a trading range.
BEAR24|This market damaged itself quite badly when it fell from the 193 level down to the 154 level, so stay tuned.
NEUT25|"I have a sign exciting message for you for Google and Rim."""
