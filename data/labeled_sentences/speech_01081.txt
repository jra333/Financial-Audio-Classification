NEUT0|"""Trying to get to some news in the crypto world today."
NEUT1|Coinbase, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US of filing its S1 with the SEC to go public.
NEUT2|Dan Roberts, of course, is all over this story for us and in this filing comes as Bitcoin continues to surge.
BEAR3|We're seeing a little bit of a pullback today, but still above 22,000.
NEUT4|What do you make the timing of the timing?
NEUT5|I guess of this as we're seeing Quimby's file to go public and then this surge also with Bitcoin.
BULL6|Well, the timing is impeccable.
NEUT7|Shawna.
NEUT8|I mean it kind of feels like everything is happening at once in terms of the Bitcoin space.
BULL9|As you mentioned, hovering around 23,000 right now 24 hours ago, Bitcoin had never had 20,000, so it has seen a huge surge in 2020.
BULL10|That kind of dramatically accelerated in the last few days.
BULL11|Coinbase has been a huge recipient of that surge in July.
BULL12|The company shared it has 35 million users globally, and by the way it's actually profitable.
NEUT13|How rare is that when we talk about hot tech unicorns that are going public, the company is profitable and it has an $8 billion valuation.
NEUT14|Now obviously this IPO isn't going to happen until 2021.
BULL15|I think it's possible forget just crypto IPOs, although will be a milestone for the crypto industry, but it could end up one of the hottest overall tech IPO's of 2021.
NEUT16|I think this would be a lot of interest here of course Coinbase you know within the crypto world a lot of critics, a lot of people say they have high fees, but I would argue it's really the only crypto exchanges become a household name if you're a regular person and you decide me, I'd like to buy a little bit of Bitcoin.
NEUT17|That's probably the one website you've actually heard of, and it's probably the one you use.
BULL18|"Yeah, certainly is it going to be interesting IPO to watch as we look ahead to next year."""
