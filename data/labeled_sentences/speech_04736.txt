BULL0|"""I think we're going to get Chicago PMI here."
NEUT1|Let's get to Rick Santelli.
NEUT2|Hey Rick.
NEUT3|Yes, you know very similar.
BULL4|Yesterday's consumer confidence.
NEUT5|Anybody with our condition ought to sit down now a big jump in Chicago.
BULL6|PMI expecting a number barely over 6066 point 366.3 that is a good number.
NEUT7|As a matter of fact, you'd have to go pretty much all the way back to July of 2018, where at 67.1, so that is a biggie.
NEUT8|And house market react to that well watch heels.
NEUT9|They are ticking up a little bit here as I speak.
NEUT10|Look at a week to date of 10 year note yields.
NEUT11|What you'll notice is that we extended and we held.
NEUT12|Now you could argue that were kind of flat today, but were flat over 170.
NEUT13|Actually, that is a very good thing considering 172 and changes the high close going back to January of 2020.
NEUT14|And let's take a Longview, shall we?
NEUT15|Here's a 10 year of 10 years.
NEUT16|Why is this important?
NEUT17|Because look at that chart.
NEUT18|What jumps out at you?
NEUT19|What jumps out to choose them in one 30s?
BULL20|Up to 2% looks like the zone we're going to spend time in, and I think that is a fairly safe bet.
BEAR21|Remember the mid to upper one 30s represented the lowest deal closes in history and 2012 and 2016 of July, and both those years until of course Kovid hit and push that number down a half one percent .50.
NEUT22|Now if we consider the momentum that we've seen of late on the long dated and realized today's the last day of March, and why is that important?
BEAR23|Because whether you're looking at Canada, New Zealand, Japan or India, this is the end of their fiscal year.
NEUT24|And it's important in a lot of mutual funds and other large institutional players also have their fiscal year calendar ending at the end of March.
NEUT25|So there's going to be some rejiggering going on.
NEUT26|We understand that.
NEUT27|Now finally, let's look at what's going on with the NOB notes over bonds.
NEUT28|30 year yields minus 10 year yields.
NEUT29|This is a really fascinating chart.
NEUT30|Chicago pit traders used to love this spread.
NEUT31|Why?
NEUT32|Gives you a good indication of the amount of horsepower, momentum on long.
NEUT33|Dated, now that it's contracting, actually it's the most narrow.
BULL34|It's been in eight months that would tell me be a little cautious that this one and three quarters area that we've bucked up against intense might end up holding for some consolidation.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
