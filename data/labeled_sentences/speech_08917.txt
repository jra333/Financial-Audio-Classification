NEUT4|Yes.
NEUT5|Do I look like Einstein absolutely and my half as smart as him by no means.
NEUT6|If you ask anyone around this room and you know me at all, I get really excited about things that are upbeat and downbeat.
BEAR7|I get upset about things.
NEUT8|I'm emotional guy.
NEUT9|For me, it's super fun.
NEUT10|I mean I love seeing my picture everywhere.

BEAR17|You have to realize this job is really stressful.
NEUT18|You're dealing with real money.
NEUT19|Alot of people who I came up with are not here anymore on any given day, we're sort of fighting for our lives in a lot of ways to represent our customers, right?
NEUT20|And do the right thing.
NEUT21|So the emotions that you see are real.
NEUT22|Well, the press used to not be down here.
NEUT23|It was not till 2007 that photographers were really allowed on a regular basis to come down to the floor.

NEUT27|This room, the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
NEUT28|Even though we don't do the volume we once did is the most significant place that impacts markets all over the world.
NEUT29|It was really very few outlets to get yourself onto the floor.
NEUT30|You knew a friend and you came down and you start at the bottom and went to the top.
NEUT31|So my family has no background in finance.
NEUT32|I just happened to be lucky that my path ended up that way.
BULL33|I got a job as a Tele typist and I really enjoyed it.
NEUT34|I loved it.
NEUT35|I love the energy here on the floor.
NEUT36|You have to realize it was a bustling.
NEUT37|It was like Grand Central station back then.

NEUT39|Everything was done with a pad and paper.
NEUT40|The floors were full of paper by 9:30 ten o'clock in the morning there were different rungs to go off to get to where you really wanted to go, which was to have a seat.
NEUT41|That was your goal was an exclusive club.
BULL42|It was a real honor to become a member of the Stock Exchange.

BEAR46|I've been here through the financial crisis of 0809, so every day here is stressful.
NEUT47|Every day is super exciting to still be a broker on the floor.
NEUT48|It's taking a lot of reinventing of myself over the years because the business has changed.
NEUT49|I really honor the fact that I've had to rebrand myself and make myself like famous.
BULL50|"And the most notice broker in the world, and for me, that's the greatest thing in the world."""
