NEUT0|"""Whom the hicap just we talk about projects that could 5X10X by the top of the bull run."
NEUT1|Ultimately this one right now has a market cap of around $450 million.
NEUT2|The ticker or the coin is metal MTL.
BEAR3|Right now each point is about $6.88 stuff about 22% today.
BULL4|The market and the volume is actually pretty nice.
NEUT5|It is about 606.65 so it means it's 665% of what the market cap is or 6.65 times.
NEUT6|So you want to see that kind of volume?
NEUT7|If you're looking at a project that's going to try to break out of the hundreds of millions and get into the billions of dollars of market cap.
NEUT8|So if they could do that, this could definitely 5X from here that be about 2.25 billion, which would be high.
NEUT9|Would have to be that some competitors to do that and build the community you'd want to see about 50,200 thousand people having it on their watch list.
NEUT10|By that point there in a competitive space, but they're claiming to be the easiest way to buy, sell, and trade crypto.
NEUT11|And they are also they have the apps already on the App Store and on Google Play, so that's good to see working product.
NEUT12|Basically they pay you every time they'll give you some of their coin every time you spend money in the store, they just make it really easy for.
NEUT13|Yeah, no fees for spending money sending an yeah just really clean system for buying and selling goods with crypto currencies and down here.
NEUT14|It actually says you can find out different trends that are going on.
NEUT15|Yes you can learn about trends are going on in crypto, seeing what people are actually spending and what they're spending it on.
NEUT16|So Wall Street and different investors are going to want to get their hands on this type of data.
BULL17|So that opens up an entire another Ave for this company.
NEUT18|And companies like it, so that'll be interesting to see.
NEUT19|Ultimately at 685.
BEAR20|But the higher today was $8.80 and $0.68, so it's down from that.
NEUT21|That was also.
BULL22|So today was the year high.
NEUT23|We would need to break back above 7, build a base there.
BULL24|Let's get these legs back up to ultimately break above that 868 and consolidate there so we can ultimately break above 10.
NEUT25|It's definitely got some work to do here.
BULL26|Communities gotta grow stronger.
NEUT27|They gotta be educating people on why it is beneficial to them to actually be using this product.
BULL28|And once that starts to happen, this can definitely get a run to maybe above a billion dollars.
NEUT29|They do have a lot of competitors, so it's laid to be seen what will happen.
NEUT30|But definitely something interesting to keep on if you like that whole.
NEUT31|Using your crypto to buy things type of atmosphere, there's other coins that are in that same one.
NEUT32|So like swipe in different projects like that.
NEUT33|So if you want to look into those type of projects, this is something you're into.
NEUT34|There's a few for you.
NEUT35|Ultimately, who knows what the winners will be here, but a lot of this stuff depends on what Bitcoin does and if they can break out to an all time high and continue the bullish momentum and allow all points to thrive in the environment of that.
NEUT36|I think it has a high probability of happening, so we need to watch out.
NEUT37|Over the next few days and the next few months, see what happens.
NEUT38|Ultimately though, if you don't like market captured this high and you want the low cap gems, look at some of her other videos, the thumbnails and the titles will say Hello, Capgemini.
NEUT39|Those are going to be ones that are under $100 million in market cap and a lot of them we try to focus on things that are under $25 million in market cap with a strong team as a market value and has clear.
NEUT40|Availability of everyone transparency with the potential to get anywhere from 1-10 X 2000 X depending on the different projects and the market problem they solve.
