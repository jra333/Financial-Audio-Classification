BULL0|"""Hey, it's Clayton."
NEUT1|This will be a video chart on ticker symbol GE.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT3|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT4|In case maybe new charts instead of using these candle sticks here, representing one days worth of price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT5|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT6|So all this error may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT7|It's actually today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT8|I'll let you this time frame is a good job of telling the quote unquote story of the price and then makes mapping out where levels of support and resistance a bit easier to see.
NEUT9|I've done this analysis several times in the past, so that's where the green and red line annotations are coming from.
NEUT10|But you gotta give credit where credits do.
NEUT11|GE has once again made another nice move today, so certainly some updates here need to be made from the technical perspective, the 1st update is based on a foundational rule in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken.
NEUT12|An closed above you want to see them act as support.
NEUT13|So going into today right up here around 788 was that area of resistance.
NEUT14|But now that the price is up above it, that would be what I'd call the ideal level of support mean.
BULL15|If they won't make this chart look the strongest going forward.
BULL16|Definitely staying up above 788.
NEUT17|With that being said.
BEAR18|If the price falls below 788, I'm not saying that implies the entire charge broken or ruined or anything like that, but at the price can manage to stay up above it.
BULL19|That would certainly be a huge sign of power going forward.
NEUT20|Taking a step back and looking at things for more so the big picture point of view.
NEUT21|That is where the purple line comes into play, which on my chart denotes the 50.
NEUT22|Simple moving average keyword being moving as time goes by, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, so very basic yet highly effective way to judge the health of the move.
NEUT23|This right here I'm defining as the move.
NEUT24|Just watch the purple line.
NEUT25|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls by definition are in an uptrend.
NEUT26|In up, trends are again what truly strong moves do.
NEUT27|So that's why I love charts.
BEAR28|When you look at him certain ways they really do kind of insult your intelligence.
NEUT29|So moral, the story.
NEUT30|A very straightforward way to judge the health of the overall movement.
NEUT31|Just stay above that purple line and as long as that's the case, that implies that the price isn't in and of itself uptrending as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT32|Nothing too complicated behind this other than the fact of the party stop today, right up around $8.00, an $0.18 so 818 will be the key level to watch going forward.
BULL33|However, as I've said in past videos in and will continue to say as long as the price continues to chip away and build higher bases.
NEUT34|Everything else will continue to take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
BULL35|So focus on healthy consolidations.
NEUT36|Focus on building higher lows and sit back and let the trend do its thing.
NEUT37|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT38|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT39|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT40|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT41|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT42|It's completely free.
NEUT43|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT44|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
