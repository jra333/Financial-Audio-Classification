NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol EENF."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|We're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, overall, uh progress has been has been made, but that's all also a matter of perspective.
NEUT5|What do I mean well?
NEUT6|Let me bring that in 'cause I get it.
NEUT7|It's hard to see right now, so I'm going to move that over here and there we go.
NEUT8|You can see that make it a little bit easier.
NEUT9|So like said progress in the sense of the price is now generally speaking around this area of the chart, right?
NEUT10|And previously today, well, it had been actually all the way down there, so there is still an overall upward slope, right?
NEUT11|There's an upwards trend of things today from an overall standpoint, but if all you care about is just today, and if you're some sort of flipper for example, then you bought right there, or you bought right there and your plan was to buy in South in 20 minutes.
NEUT12|Well, then from that angle things the chart looks.
BEAR13|Not very good at all, because obviously from those areas the price just continue to drop and drop and drop.
NEUT14|So as far as I know is this a bullish or bearish chart?
NEUT15|I don't know what was your strategy.
NEUT16|What was your game plan going in?
BEAR17|If you care about things from the overall standpoint, then yeah, even with the pullback today, as annoying as in, it's frustrating as that can be the trend.
NEUT18|Like I said, is still in the upward direction 'cause the price.
NEUT19|Now when I say trend I mean.
BEAR20|Over the past couple of days, obviously with a big gap down that shifted things, so I'm talking about just the past couple of days in the trend and the fact that like I said, when you look and consider the areas of Lowe's, these lows are progressing in the upward direction, so the turn around is still totally underway.
NEUT21|Now, of course this drift just continues and continues and continues that all changes.
BULL22|But in this situation, as of now the price is still up above that level.
BULL23|So I mean you got to still give the boys a little bit of credit there as far as levels of resistance.
NEUT24|If there is any sort of attempted moving back upwards right there at the .024.
NEUT25|Area still remains that area that red line which I talked about in previous videos.
BEAR26|To be fair, the price actually did break above it problems.
NEUT27|Couldn't quite stay above it, so continue to watch that.
NEUT28|And then as far as levels of support, I'm going to go ahead and adjust this area up here to the .0165 mark, which would, ideally speaking, be the level that you want to see the price continue to hold above.
BULL29|So yeah, today bit of a disappointment, but looking at the past couple of days, progress is being made.
NEUT30|There is a higher base, so let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT33|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT34|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR39|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
