BULL0|"""Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel."
BULL1|Hope you guys are is excited and fired up as I am today.
BULL2|BitTorrent just hit its all time high.
BULL3|We crossed over the 004 cents and we made it to 0042 this morning in the wee hours.
NEUT4|I mean it's since retraced and sold off since then but mean if you scroll back here.
BEAR5|Our previous high was 0041 so we are into uncharted territories here.
BULL6|This morning we got our highest sale ever go through.
BEAR7|Look at the volume guys this morning when that ran up just.
NEUT8|Just crazy guys.
NEUT9|I think if this this partner speak for itself, if you guys aren't holding some BTT.
BEAR10|I mean I feel bad for you at this point, like there's been a crazy ride.
NEUT11|It's just percent wise right?
NEUT12|Like man what a stock water run so it's not a stock coin, but anyway, it's ridiculous.
BULL13|It's been a fun run.
BULL14|Looking forward to seeing more from this outfit there, this BitTorrent and it's been gaining a lot of traction in India.
BULL15|It's been gaining a lot of traffic in Africa.
NEUT16|Globally, even in France, Andorra, lots of search search is trending on Google Trends.
BULL17|This one I think it's going to be going to be a little bit mainstay, and you know we got OK.
NEUT18|There's a trillion coins or a trillion tokens for this one.
NEUT19|So everybody's saying a dollar is unheard of, but.
NEUT20|What happens when we start burning these tokens like isn't that the point of this thing existing like you spend them for higher transaction fees, right?
NEUT21|So or higher transaction speed, peer to peer download speed.
NEUT22|So I think they should be burnt once they're spent.
NEUT23|I'm not sure.
BULL24|I'll obviously look into that from now on, but if we are burning supply and the supply gets burnt up to like 30 forty, 50% like obviously we can see higher numbers so I'm excited.
BULL25|I hope you guys are excited.
NEUT26|I'm sticking around for this one.
NEUT27|I'm going to be holding long term and seeing what happens if it blows up in my face.
NEUT28|Blows up in my face whatever.
NEUT29|Anyways guys quick little bird.
BULL30|I hope you stuck around to the end.
NEUT31|It's only two minutes long here this morning guys.
NEUT32|So anyways, that's the price update for BT today.
NEUT33|"Let's let's take this one to the moon."""
