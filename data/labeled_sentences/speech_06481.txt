NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, I think for joining this technical analysis video here the exam.com."
NEUT1|It's Friday, July 3rd time Christina Bertha Neal, investment analyst.
NEUT2|Taking a look at the US versus the Canadian dollar in the daily chart before we head for the weekend.
BEAR3|So looking at the chart, we can see that the descending trendline is stretched for one point.
BEAR4|4667 managed to stop upside corrections once again at the end of June, pushing the price back to the one point 35 area.
NEUT5|The basic scenario for the short term remains negative because if we look.
BEAR6|At the other side, this continues to weaken below its 50 neutral mark, while the sarcastic's keep sloping downwards.
NEUT7|However, looking at the short term picture how the higher highs and higher lows from the three month low of one point 3314 remains in place and unless we remove the support area between the 20 and 200 day, moving average is currently around the one point 35 level, then we may see another retest of the descending trendline.
BULL8|A break of which, and more importantly, a close above one point 3685, could drives us up to one point 3830, where the 38.2% hibachi of the download from one point 4667 to one point 3314 is located breaking that border as well.
BEAR9|Then the rally may continue up to the 50% people nature of one point 3990 now in the negative scenario, if we close decisively below the 200 day moving average and V 1.35 level.
BEAR10|More losses could follow probably to 1.34 before we before we head for the three month low one point 3314 breaking that low we the pair would resume its downward pattern, likely pushing support towards the one point 32 round level.
NEUT11|So that's all from me.
BULL12|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
