BULL0|"""Will your portfolio go better with Coke?"
NEUT1|Will take a look.
NEUT2|Here's one company I don't need to tell you much about.
BULL3|Its Coca Cola, the global leader in soft drinks.
NEUT4|It used to be called pop, but that was a long time ago.
NEUT5|It's a soda.
NEUT6|What is it?
NEUT7|It's sugar in water.
NEUT8|It's kept very, very cold and you pay two $3 to buy a bottle at your local supermarket drugstore convenience store, whatever it is.
NEUT9|And it's a global brand.
NEUT10|Is it a good investment?
BULL11|It's been a great investment.
NEUT12|Maybe not in the last five years, but it's been for the last 150 years.
NEUT13|But let's take a look at the chart here.
NEUT14|You can see it trades for about $46 a share.
NEUT15|This charts about five years.
BULL16|I would say it's doubled in the last five years, which is great by any normal benchmark of stock market performance.
NEUT17|Maybe not when you compare it to Google and Amazon.
NEUT18|Is it a global brand?
NEUT19|Yes, of course.
NEUT20|It's a global brand.
BULL21|Is it a good investment for your portfolio?
NEUT22|I like Coca Cola not maybe not as much as Warren Buffett.
NEUT23|He's on the board.
NEUT24|He owns 10% of the stock, he said famously, I'd never sell a share of Coca Cola.
NEUT25|And why should he if he's owned it for 20 thirty 40 years, maybe even longer.
NEUT26|He seen his money go up and up and up and up.
NEUT27|It never has done anything but go up in his lifetime.
NEUT28|So why wouldn't Warren Buffett think it's one of the great investments of all time for you getting in at $46 a share?
BEAR29|It's a little harder you're paying 44 times earnings that's off the charts in a bad way.
NEUT30|You're giving them $44.
NEUT31|They're giving you a dollar of earnings.
NEUT32|Not such a great deal.
NEUT33|But is Coca Cola ahold forever stock?
NEUT34|It has been?
NEUT35|Will it be in the millennial generation?
NEUT36|Less so maybe some of you are millennials out.
NEUT37|There was the last time you bought a Coca Cola.
NEUT38|You might drink water.
NEUT39|You might drink fruit chews.
NEUT40|You might drink tea.
NEUT41|Coca Cola is probably not a go to drink.
NEUT42|I suspect the demographics.
NEUT43|Are somewhat older and the people that drink it, but I don't know that for sure.
NEUT44|What's the good part about Coca Cola?
BULL45|Return on equity is great.
BULL46|The return on assets is great.
NEUT47|8-9 percent.
BULL48|Return on invested capital's excellent.
NEUT49|They do a very good job at managing the distribution globally of Coca Cola, but you're paying you're paying Rolls Royce prices for a $0.10 drink, which is what I used to pay as a child when I was buying Coca Cola.
NEUT50|Maybe it was a quarter, but it was not.
NEUT51|It wasn't $2.39 which you might pay at LaGuardia Airport.
NEUT52|That's all the time we have this week on the investment adviser.
NEUT53|I'm your host Matthew Stevenson, in partnership with Dukascopy TV.
NEUT54|Remember, money can take care of you.
NEUT55|"It cannot take care of itself."""
