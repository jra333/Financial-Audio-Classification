NEUT0|"""Well, tech billionaire Jack Ma is changing his tune."
NEUT1|The founder of Alibaba sat down with Tesla CEO Elon Musk at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference and said quote, I think people should work three days a week, 4 hours a day.
NEUT2|I think because of artificial intelligence people will have more time and guys.
NEUT3|It's a far cry from the 12 hours a day, six days a week, work culture.
NEUT4|He previously endorsed of course is looking at the future in the way that AI might impact the work schedule, but still pretty optimistic Jack Ma when he looks at.
NEUT5|How our lives will be in the future.
NEUT6|I think he's just pointing to the fact that we're going to be more efficient going forward, because with the help of AI, right?
NEUT7|He's not saying that we should just work less overall, he's just saying that it's going to make us more efficient and thus people won't have to actually work as many hours physically.
NEUT8|But he and Elon Musk actually didn't quite agree on just how smart computers.
NEUT9|Yeah, are though, right?
NEUT10|Because Elon Musk was saying that computers are so smart and Jack was like, well, we created computers.
NEUT11|Computers didn't necessarily create us so.
NEUT12|They're they're cool, but not all that.
BEAR13|Famously, Elon Musk has warned about AI's AI kind of being a threat to humanity overall as well.
NEUT14|Absolutely, I mean, the future is now, and hopefully we make the right decisions so we don't have a Terminator 2 future.
NEUT15|Sure, yes.
NEUT16|When it comes to AI intact, there are a lot of positive things self driving cars for example.
BEAR17|I understand automation is going to kick truck drivers out of their jobs and I think that's absolutely devastating.
NEUT18|But when it comes to everyday safety behind the wheel, it is showing that you know AI cars learn when one makes a mistake.
NEUT19|They all make a mistake and they all learn from it.
BULL20|So I think that can be a benefit.
NEUT21|But what we have here then is people who will be working less.
NEUT22|Do we have to put in what Andrew Yang is calling for?
NEUT23|Universal Universal basic income and if that is the case and that has been the case in some other Western countries, yeah, if that is the case, what do we tax AI as?
NEUT24|What do we tax machines as Germany gave companies that automated almost they gave their automation almost human head status or they tax them the same as if they were real employees to offset the fact that many of those people have lost their jobs.
NEUT25|So these are conversations that are going to become much more mainstream and you know you go back to like a universal basic income.
NEUT26|Just I mean, even in 2012 that would have been considered completely insane.
NEUT27|Yeah, and now you know now it's a big part of it.
NEUT28|Up on 2020 and now it is a big plat of big part of a platform of a candidate who is going to be in the top ten when it comes to the Democratic debate.
NEUT29|Yeah, it can't be ignored.
NEUT30|I mean, it's something that I think we got.
NEUT31|People had ignored it for awhile.
NEUT32|Then we also have this situation and you know this is a little bit more abstract, but as we're seeing with the immense amount of violence coming out, so many of these children, kids, whatever.
NEUT33|You know, committing massive acts of violence.
NEUT34|I am a little bit concerned with where people find self worth where people find human dignity.
NEUT35|Oftentimes the former was you tide it to your job like my father was a truck driver who was very proud of being a truck driver.
NEUT36|A lot of people found all of their self worth and who they were with their position.
NEUT37|So what's going to happen when they just kind of the heart of the 996 program to its Jack Maas belief that like going to work was an honor, right?
NEUT38|And working as an honor.
NEUT39|So that's something that you should pull away from.
NEUT40|But you're right as you shift away from that.
NEUT41|If you're just getting paid to sit there, there's a lot of mental health aspects that should be attached to that.
NEUT42|If you're just not doing anything, because that's where a lot of people do derive their worth to be sitting in this chair.
NEUT43|I get a lot out of it.
NEUT44|Get a lot out of it.
NEUT45|I'm a small business owner.
NEUT46|I podcast every day.
NEUT47|Yeah, I mean, that's that's how it identifies.
NEUT48|You won't be very happy guy.
NEUT49|Or maybe you would have a robot.
NEUT50|Can't do what I do.
NEUT51|Nobody, not not going to say that I've seen those AI news Reporter.
BULL52|"Yeah, so they're coming for us, yeah, great dark, very dark prospects."""
