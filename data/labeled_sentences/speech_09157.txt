NEUT0|"""Time now for futures in focus and Guy and I are taking a look at Bitcoin futures, so I should point out by the Bitcoin futures are really small percentage of what actually makes up from Bitcoin trading."
NEUT1|But what we're seeing in it is quite interesting guy.
NEUT2|We have a chart that shows open interest and the price.
NEUT3|Now typically if you have the price and open interest moving together, that tends to mean something like organic demand.
BULL4|New longs coming in.
NEUT5|If you see open interest go down in the market goes up.
BULL6|Well, that's just some straight up short covering, so maybe we're able to break out more.
NEUT7|On the other hand, we has pierced.
NEUT8|$13,000 mark.
BEAR9|So you could be in overbought territory.
NEUT10|Technically, I'm told we are in overbought territory, but this is Bitcoin so who knows, but the logic in some ways is certainly there.
BULL11|Alex as we see debt levels, government debt levels around the world going up and going up at a rapid race you would have thought the devaluation or debasement certainly become more and more likely.
NEUT12|Therefore, in theory and you could make the argument for gold, but that doesn't seem to be holding up that well.
NEUT13|You could make the argument that maybe you want to be buying into Bitcoin and you want to be buying into other such products.
NEUT14|I wonder whether that's what is driving things at the moment, or whether we're back to speculative fervor.
NEUT15|But it's interesting that the potentially at this moment there would seem to be a little bit more logic to what is happening, and it also raises the question of what is a good inflation trade like?
NEUT16|As you point out, if you have a lot of money printing all around the world, what is the best inflation trade like it used to be gold, but also overall commodities?
NEUT17|Oil for example, and I have to factor in Bitcoin Bitcoin specifically, not necessarily Ethereum or Ripple for example.
NEUT18|Well, it's interesting that that we saw the GS call yesterday on commodities.
NEUT19|Part of that, as you pointed out, was inflation doesn't have to be.
NEUT20|Oil.
NEUT21|Can be copper can be all the other metals as well.
NEUT22|"But that's a real store of value in some ways."""
