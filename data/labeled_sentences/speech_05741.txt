NEUT0|"""I'm Michael Bomba and I'm a 20 year old Forex trader."
NEUT1|I wake up every day at 5:00 AM.
NEUT2|I like to start my day off with a glass of water and then grab a coffee and have breakfast is super key for me to eat.
NEUT3|Hopefully I want to keep my energy levels up throughout the day and think clearly before jumping the charts.

NEUT5|It's usually Andy Brazil or Gary Vee.
NEUT6|It's 6:00 AM now and I'm on the charts and like to spend a good 30 to 45 minutes going through my daily watchlist, forecasting and planning for trades.
NEUT7|After a pump today, I'll then schedule three to four hours of one hour time slots.
NEUT8|I put my phone on airplane mode and leave it in my draw until around 12:00 PM and uses time each day to get some focus working without any distractions within the period of focus on continuous learning and things are going to help me reach for new Heights.
NEUT9|This could be anything from watching, trade recaps, backtesting, or making requirements to my trading.
NEUT10|It's around 1:00 PM now and I'm off the coffee shop I'm going to meet a fellow traders to get some chart working and get some content for social media.
NEUT11|I like to get to meet up with the little traders at least once per month is so valuable.
NEUT12|Having a community of like minded traders.
NEUT13|Going through the same highs and lows within the journeys year, we always tend to share ideas, discuss goals and keep each other accountable to maximize growth.
NEUT14|I usually write up my daily goals in the morning, but today I've saved it for me, took a lot to wrap up my daily goals each day in the line with my longer term goals and values.
NEUT15|My focus for this year, both trade and social media study or achieve my goals are based around these.
NEUT16|A quick check of the charts now before I head off to check and manage any running trades.
NEUT17|Currently just been taken out of Town, Dollar short for 2.4% profit, but I didn't capitalize on this move fully with the scaling opportunity missed, so it's time for me to take screenshots and making notes and learn from it while it's fresh in my mind.
NEUT18|3:00 PM now and I must go to the office for a couple of hours.
NEUT19|Whilst driving, attempt to listen to audiobooks and maximize time and learn whilst on the go.
NEUT20|I usually listen at 1/2 times speed and get through about 2 bucks per month.
NEUT21|It's 6:00 PM and I'm ready for dinner.
NEUT22|This is a good point to spend time with family chat about the day before heading back upstairs.
