NEUT0|"""Skinny, you know."
NEUT1|We talked 50.
NEUT2|Welcome back is the 1st of April 2021 Thursday to 50 of the week.
BULL3|We're #8 units optimistic are unique, so 4 units up against BDC.
NEUT4|It's not really looking that good in my opinion.
BEAR5|Double bearish divergance higher, higher on the price, lower high on the Mac, D lower high on the RSI.
BULL6|So which means that potentially there could be a new trend change coming on for use up against BTC.
NEUT7|The danger is there and the danger is real so you need to be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT8|Yes we could still go.
NEUT9|Yes, you could pop higher, but I see a double barrel agents so more likely than not so they should be moved towards.
NEUT10|The downside, to be honest I would prefer it because this means that like one could be forming a symmetrical triangle and it could be popping much higher.
NEUT11|If that happens would be great, but.
NEUT12|Yeah, I don't really see it yet, so be careful.
NEUT13|Be very careful about going to attract too soon.
NEUT14|Alright?
NEUT15|Let's move onto units up against USD T, but before that please give this video like eventually it subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think.
NEUT16|What you need in the comments below.
BULL17|4 units up against USD T. Same thing double bearish divergance.
BEAR18|I think it's a triple bearish divergance if I am not wrong.
BULL19|Tree higher highs.
NEUT20|I see OK, no, it's not so.
NEUT21|Yeah, this would just be considered as a double bearish divergance.
BEAR22|Marginally, I don't like marginally higher high, so this means that potentially there could be a new trend change coming on.
NEUT23|For Unisoft, we're not exactly sure.
NEUT24|We don't really see any big sell off yet, but you could really see that the highest candle stick over here is a shooting star.
BULL25|And shooting stars are signs of a reversal.
NEUT26|If the last candle at the top is a shooting stuff, potentially we could be reversing.
NEUT27|Sure, we could go a little bit higher, but things are just not really looking that good for you.
BULL28|At this point, I'm sure we could go higher.
NEUT29|We can go like $250, maybe, but I feel like the end is not too far away and there could be a deep retracement coming on for you.
NEUT30|Need stop.
NEUT31|So be very careful about going into a trade too soon.
NEUT32|Alright, I guess it from my unisoft technical analysis.
BULL33|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL34|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT35|"I shall see you in the next video."""
