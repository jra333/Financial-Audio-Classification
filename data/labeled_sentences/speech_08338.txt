NEUT0|"""Jason Calacanis Tech investor, An inside.com founder."
NEUT1|I am eager to hear your thoughts on this.
NEUT2|Let's start with Amazon.
NEUT3|What do you make of this labor movement?
NEUT4|What do you make of Amazon?
NEUT5|Sort of aggressive response to lawmakers to union organizers?
BEAR6|Are they alienating workers at this critical inflection point for them?
NEUT7|Yeah, thanks for having me on and it's a complex issue and democracy is messy and we are in a battle for ideas and philosophies here in the United States and it's working.
NEUT8|We have labor saying we want to get a higher rate per hour and Amazon has led the way they give a $15 minimum wage.
NEUT9|So you can give a win to labor and you can also give a win to Amazon now who pays well and people want to work for them and maybe they don't want to work at McDonald's, which has been, you know amongst companies.
NEUT10|One that has fought?
NEUT11|Keep the minimum wage down and so democracy can be messy, but I love Amazon, saying hey listen Bernie Elizabeth who are incredibly hysterical and ridiculous in their approach to dunking on entrepreneurs dunking on capitalism, which is not what Americans want.
NEUT12|Americans love capitalism.
BULL13|They love the competition to provide products and services they want to see labor do better.
NEUT14|Of course we all do, but they don't want.
NEUT15|I don't think they want to live in a socialist.
NEUT16|Country and of course it's not, then uh, these issues are simple, but there's a reason why Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders don't have cabinet positions, and there are reasons why they got.
BEAR17|They didn't get the nomination because their ideas are bad.
NEUT18|According to the American voting public complicated than that.
NEUT19|Not to the American public who votes labor movement well, this labor movement is has been building an it may be, according to Amazon workers that create that efficiency that's made it one of the most powerful players in Tekken e-commerce.
NEUT20|You mentioned $15 minimum wage.
NEUT21|This isn't just about pay.
BEAR22|Yes, Amazon gives $15 minimum wage, but over the last year, their warehouse workers have become essential.
BEAR23|Employees worked through a pandemic and their amazing.
BEAR24|Some would argue missteps.
NEUT25|Along the way, Amazon wasn't all that transparent in terms of their covid numbers.
NEUT26|There's also the whole issue about working conditions.
NEUT27|I mean, we now have.
NEUT28|You know, documents that reporters have uncovered, showing that Amazon is in fact aware of drivers peeing in bottles just so that they can see you know their shifts and fulfill these demands.
BEAR29|Obviously that is unacceptable if it's in fact true, or to the extent it's true, it's totally unacceptable.
BEAR30|We all agree on that, so again, we're in a competition for ideas here.
NEUT31|People are debating this issue out in the public in America, the way it's supposed to be done.
NEUT32|And I like the fact.
NEUT33|That Amazon is saying to Elizabeth Warren on Twitter in front of us the voting public.
NEUT34|Hey, we paid our taxes.
NEUT35|Hey, we gave you the $15 minimum wage.
NEUT36|What are you doing to change the tax code?
NEUT37|Why don't you set the federal you know minimum wage at $15.00.
NEUT38|So this is a vibrant competition of ideas occurring on Twitter in front of our eyes between the top person at Amazon, responsible for it and the top, you know, not the top politicians.
NEUT39|The politicians who were kind of voted.
NEUT40|Not to be that important, let's be totally honest.
NEUT41|Most Americans do not believe in socialism and do not believe in their view of America.
NEUT42|They want competition and they want labor.
NEUT43|These things do not have to be so adversary.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
