NEUT0|"""Force the stock market soared in 2013, and even though we've had sort of a rocky start so far this year, just starting to see signs that the stock markets bull market could continue to run higher now what's propelling the stock market?"
NEUT1|Lately?
NEUT2|It's been dividends.
NEUT3|My name is Dan Caplinger.
NEUT4|I'm the Motley Fool's director of investment planning, and today I want to talk.
NEUT5|I'll take a look at why dividends are helping to send stocks soaring.
BULL6|A basically what we've seen lately is that companies have been incredibly profitable and they've been returning those profits.
NEUT7|In the form of dividends during 2013, according to figures from S&P Dow Indices, we saw 2895 different stocks.
NEUT8|Almost 2900.
BULL9|Stocks raised their dividends from previous year levels.
BULL10|On the other hand, only about 300 made dividend cuts, and so you can see that the real trend has been toward increased dividends when you add up the total dollar volume of those increases in dividends you saw, companies payout an additional.
BULL11|$54.6 billion in 2013, that money really helped the stock market move higher.
NEUT12|In addition, we're seeing trying to see companies that haven't paid dividends in years come out and start making those payments.
NEUT13|For instance, just the other day General Motors came out with its first dividend since it declared bankruptcy is paying $0.30 a share on a quarterly basis?
NEUT14|And that doesn't sound like much, but it equates to a 3% yield that's really big for a company that just started.
NEUT15|To pay a dividend.
BULL16|In addition, you have existing dividend payers making big increases to the amounts that they've been paying.
BULL17|So you got Boeing for instance, it upped its dividend by 50%.
BULL18|Three M made a 35% increase very recently, and so when you put all those things together is making investors excited about being shareholders.
NEUT19|You're getting more income from their Holdings.
BULL20|They're more willing to pay up for a higher stock price in order to own those shares, and that's boosting the stock market returns now.
