BULL0|"""Happy birthday Warren."
NEUT1|Thank you.
NEUT2|Thank you.
NEUT3|Never thought 88.
NEUT4|Never thought about lying about your age.
NEUT5|No, that never occurred to me, actually.
NEUT6|I might say hi, I'm older.
NEUT7|Actually I can get all these.
NEUT8|I mean people do things for you alright with imagine yeah, well and they have low expectations to this glide luncheon is 19 years old.
NEUT9|The first one went for $2500 now worth 3.3 million.
NEUT10|What happened?
NEUT11|the Fed says there's no inflation that's to run away.
NEUT12|But what happened between then and now?
BEAR13|I hope we're not at the CPI.
NEUT14|It'll just start things now.
NEUT15|Well, what happened?
NEUT16|One important thing happened was was eBay.
NEUT17|You know our audience was limited to a.
NEUT18|A group or getting together in San Francisco for a dinner to start with and then in effect eBay made that dinner table worldwide so that that was dramatic.
NEUT19|Isn't it amazing that eBay now that I think of it, the access and the reach that it's given people for things like this to sell things absolutely?
NEUT20|The world has changed so much you want they say productivity is only going up a little bit or I am so much more productive now than 20 years ago?
NEUT21|Not like not doing it in the internal factors, but the facts I can learn.
NEUT22|In seconds, that took me hours to dig around in the library.
NEUT23|Or, you know, just in writing my and reported it saves me hours and hours and hours and hours which you have ever thought, thinking that eBay has done so well for this charity to buy eBay stock, I probably should have.
NEUT24|I've missed a lot of us I, by being anchored in the 20th century, did not help nurture.
NEUT25|Well, I'll tell you so.
NEUT26|As we look at this, the money the 3.3 million will go to homeless services through the Glide Foundation.
BULL27|The economy is done so well.
BULL28|People say it is strong, it's getting stronger.
BEAR29|So by that logic we would expect to see a lesser demand for homeless services.
NEUT30|Are you seeing that at all?
NEUT31|No no and glide.
NEUT32|Takes the people of the world's forgotten about and and given up on.
NEUT33|Maybe they've given up on themselves and Cecil Williams for more than 50 years and running Glide has never given up on anyone.
BEAR34|There are millions of jobs out there though.
NEUT35|However, you could also argue, and that's terrific, but you could argue that the quality of the jobs isn't necessarily incredible.
BEAR36|Well paying and some don't come with benefits, and the wage growth is stagnant WHI.
NEUT37|Is that right now?
NEUT38|But Liz.
NEUT39|You're right about what you say the problem is.
NEUT40|Not the 25 year old history trainable.
NEUT41|If something happens to their job but take carpet installation.
NEUT42|Nobody thinks about, everybody will tell you if I talked to our carpet people everywhere in the country.
NEUT43|They need carpet installers.
NEUT44|They need truck drivers and and they need people in jobs that pay 60 or $70,000 a year where we're paying.
NEUT45|We've got to school in Denver that our home builder contributes to.
NEUT46|Just teach.
NEUT47|Construction skills so matching everybody up, but some people.
NEUT48|"Do not get the lucky straws in life and and we live in this incredibly prosperous society an like any rich family we should take care of everybody."""
