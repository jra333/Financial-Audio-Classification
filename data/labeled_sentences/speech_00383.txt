NEUT0|"""Hello, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
BEAR1|We can see Apple had a negative day during the most of the time and then it managed to bounce back to the positive area.
BEAR2|Till the closing the market so it's a struggle sign for Apple stock.
NEUT3|If we change chart into daily chart.
NEUT4|I can see here we got another small red candle.
NEUT5|This red candle means there's still a lot of buying power to support the price, but it's not.
BULL6|Strong enough because we got a very small low light here.
NEUT7|But as long as we keep the above.
NEUT8|The top of this condo.
NEUT9|The prices.
BULL10|121.99 as long as we keep above this level, we are still in uptrend.
NEUT11|We can see here already got 3 candles.
NEUT12|Above this level, so it's still a construct centimeter.
NEUT13|So let's wait to see what will happen because the volume is too shy.
NEUT14|I don't think the advance will be powerful, it will be mild.
BULL15|"Thank you."""
