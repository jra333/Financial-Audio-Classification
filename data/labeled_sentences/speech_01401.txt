NEUT0|"""Hey folks, and welcome to another edition of two stocks making the news."
NEUT1|I'm joined as ever by Michael just came up a Chris.
NEUT2|So two pretty big ticket.
NEUT3|So we're going to be talking about today.
NEUT4|First up is Barkley, so right?
NEUT5|What's been going on two big pieces of news at Barclays over the weekend.
BEAR6|First off, it completely shocked the market on the morning, the day before their results were due.
NEUT7|10:00 AM come out and released their profits early, yeah?
NEUT8|Pretty yet surprising that they would choose to do it.
NEUT9|That's right, confirming a report that was in the FT that just happened to have the right numbers, and so they came out and said, actually, that's correct.
NEUT10|Our profits are going to be this a day early, but overshadowing that piece of news over the weekend, the news that 25,000 customer details are whistleblowers, command said they were on offer on the black market that's been handed in to a Reporter there.
NEUT11|Another big customer related.
NEUT12|Scandal out.
NEUT13|It's a Buckley subsidy.
BEAR14|More bad payoff.
BEAR15|Barclays is if they need anymore, it's just another big blow to to reputation there that they just can't catch a break at the moment to Barclays in terms of its reputation, its relationship with its customers, this another one in the financial planning Department since 2008.
NEUT16|For the whole piece of news outlets and is there any sort of hint on the possible ramifications that could be thrown on them?
BEAR17|With that there could be a fine, I think, just purely a loss of reputation as a result of this, it's it's all piling up and compounding for those guys.
NEUT18|So yeah, not good news for shareholders unfortunately not really OK, so next we have Centrica right news from today.
BEAR19|Yeah, actually shares have been under pressure on the morning that Ed Davey.
NEUT20|The energy sector is come out and.
NEUT21|Pandeia letter to energy regulators to say.
BEAR22|We think that the British Gas is under has maybe a bit too much power in the gas market, may be earning a bit too much money for the energy secretaries.
NEUT23|Liking pointed out that they have 41% market share in the gas sector in the UK.
NEUT24|Yeah, they're making triple profit margins that electricity companies are making pointing out there that they weigh more than the supermarkets would on the items that they sell and that kind of thing.
NEUT25|Saying it's it's too much money they're making.
NEUT26|And possibly they should be forced to split up and become more competitive for.
NEUT27|I was going to say voters there, but that's kind of the same thing.
NEUT28|Almost go both ways, right exactly?
NEUT29|I think this is something where you're an investor or you know anyone who's taking an interest in in what's going on there.
NEUT30|It's.
NEUT31|It's so plain that that.
NEUT32|This is a very strong political element to what's going on.
NEUT33|We got an election coming up in 2015 and there's nothing there are few things as popular as bashing on the rising gas prices so well.
NEUT34|There you go.
NEUT35|So some things tomorrow over so I never thought I would have seen it myself.
NEUT36|Mike was just commenting on investing and politics, so a double whammy today.
NEUT37|So thank you very much, Mark, and we'll see you again next time.
BULL38|"Thank you."""
