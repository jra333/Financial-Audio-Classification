NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of DocuSign is range between $3.71 per share and negative $18.36 per share."
NEUT1|How are these values calculated?
NEUT2|So paying $3.71 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding they have 371 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT3|Fair enough, how do I calculate this negative 1836?
NEUT4|Well, unfortunately for Doc, you sign this means that the company would have to pay you $18.36 for a transaction of stock to occur.
BEAR5|This negative price is simply a function of the fact that they haven't posted net profits.
BEAR6|In fact, it's only been net losses and net losses in the amount of negative $163 million.
NEUT7|This is their meet their median, the statistical center of all these losses here.
NEUT8|So quite sad for DocuSign we would stop here guys, you would want to have or invest in a company that is posted at least 10 years straight of net.
NEUT9|Profits not net losses.
NEUT10|However, what's the company trading at today?
NEUT11|So I can't believe people are buying this company $197.60.
NEUT12|Why it's not justified?
NEUT13|There's no justification for this price.
BEAR14|Look at their absent PE ratio, which is indicative of the fact that they are in fact still posting net losses.
NEUT15|Don't invest in DocuSign guys save you money.
NEUT16|It's not worth it.
NEUT17|Too much risk.
NEUT18|You're the principle is not going to be safe there, so there's not going to be any margin of safety if you're defensive investor like myself, just put your money into Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT19|Now this is only assuming we're either considering an investment in Company A, which is Doc.
NEUT20|You sign in this case, or some alternative.
NEUT21|This is that some alternative.
NEUT22|I understand that there's thousands of companies that you can invest in, but for every analysis I always look at it from this binary perspective.
NEUT23|It just helps simplify things a bit.
NEUT24|So we would want to invest in the Vanguard 500 because Warren Buffett loves him.
NEUT25|10 year return trailing is 12.98%.
NEUT26|Low variance, low beta here.
NEUT27|But you know we would wait.
NEUT28|We wait until.
NEUT29|I mean if you really want to wait for DocuSign to start posting some positive profits, we would wait until this number turns positive.
NEUT30|Until then guys subscribe to my channel so you can continue to gain insight on how to analyze business performance.
