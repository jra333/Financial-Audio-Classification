NEUT0|"""I'm Mark Referes Brendan T-bone Matthews and our stock of the day is Berkshire Hathaway."
NEUT1|The company reported about a week ago now, so it's a good time to look back and take a quick review.
NEUT2|What do you think of Berkshire Hathaway Brown?
BULL3|So another another great year.
BULL4|So operating the operating businesses reported pretax earnings growth of 14% and the investment portfolio advanced 13%.
BULL5|So great great collection of businesses put together by Warren Buffett continuing to grow, I think.
BULL6|It's great now.
NEUT7|Berkshire Hathaway has always been one of the more expensive stock, at least the A shares, yeah right its share price wise.
NEUT8|What do you think about its valuation right now?
NEUT9|I think I think it's very attractively valued so the stock is at 1.4 times book value.
NEUT10|Now if you compare that to the SMP which is at 2.7 times book value, I think.
NEUT11|I think Berkshire is pretty cheap actually.
NEUT12|OK, so if it's cheap and what do you think is a good valuation for it, right?
NEUT13|So when I value Berkshire, I basically do two things.
NEUT14|I apply multiple to its pre tax earnings.
NEUT15|And then I add investments for sure.
NEUT16|So in 2013 they earned $6.08 pre tax earnings.
NEUT17|I apply a 10 multiple that that gives me $61.00 per B share and then they have $8086 in investments.
BULL18|Proby, SHHH, add those together and I get $147 per share which is about a 20% premium to the stock trading price now which is 124.
BULL19|So I think it's definitely attractively valued.
NEUT20|I think it's probably worth 147.
NEUT21|Maybe even more wow alright, for T-bone Matthews I'm Mark wreath that's our stock of the day.
NEUT22|"Will see you next week."""
