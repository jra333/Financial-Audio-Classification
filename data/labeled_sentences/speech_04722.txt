NEUT1|This is a quick stock analysis of Chipotle.
NEUT2|Ticker symbol CMG.
NEUT3|Now, these drawings are here from our previous post about Chipola, where we talked about how the bottom was was in.
NEUT4|At least we thought for the short term and our price objective.
BULL5|We saw price get up here and we are approaching that.
BEAR6|Rav 441 right now we're getting towards the lower end of our range.
BULL7|In that post we talked about the indicators pointing towards bullish momentum coming in RSI, having a nice uptrend on it, I get the drawing tool.
BULL8|RSI was try trailing out very nicely.
BULL9|Stochastics, which we used as short term indicator that was pointing very nicely.
NEUT10|Anne.
BULL11|Now we are hopefully approaching at least to the midline of this consolidation channel and hopefully maybe get up to that upper end.
BULL12|That will take another earnings report to push it there in our opinion, but we are definitely heading in the right track.
BULL13|We're up five and a half percent today.
NEUT14|This is July 22nd.
NEUT15|Excuse me.
NEUT16|Anne.

BULL18|Like we said, we are in this consolidation period.
BULL19|We broke out here, nurtured sideways, and now we're coming back up again.
NEUT20|If we expand the chart to the weekly.
BEAR21|You can see this more as consolidation, much better, and this price level where we bounced off like heavy volume and now the past few weeks it's been very, very sidelined.
NEUT22|Small trading an.
BULL23|You know that this line has held up before earnings, so obviously traders thought that was a fair value for the stock, and now we're trading higher.
BEAR24|We like Chipotle short term, you are going to run into some resistance around here.
NEUT25|You know you look left.
NEUT26|Previous resistance we bring, we drag it all the way across, and that's at the.
NEUT27|Around the four 7475 level.
