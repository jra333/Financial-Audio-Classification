NEUT0|"""Ocugen oh CGN stock."
NEUT1|So what am I gonna do with this?
NEUT2|I feel like shorting this or buying puts on this.
BEAR3|I just feel the evaluation on this is overly done.
NEUT4|It's overly hyped, it would just was sitting here in this sort of moving, moving and all of a sudden gotten used for clarification on the code vaccine in India and the next thing that just popped off.
NEUT5|Uh, sorry, popping off and then consulted and just popped up more has 81% pass rate on it.
BEAR6|I just still don't trust it.
BEAR7|Honestly, I don't think it's going to really play with all the major players and it's kind of it's going to be a rude awakening for a lot of folks.
NEUT8|My pop off more once I get some more approvals might go up to 1520 with all the hype and how things are going, but in reality I don't really see this as something as a good long term.
NEUT9|If you're going to make the money, make it now, but in the end, once the tops off it's going to come down hard.
NEUT10|Because honestly, this is I company and all the sudden they started doing covid vaccines and partnering with the other people.
NEUT11|Just it doesn't make sense to me and just the way things are going.
NEUT12|And try talking to StockTwits on this.
NEUT13|They got 100 people you say 1 back, peoples come bashing that you like like bears and stuff so.
NEUT14|Just doesn't make sense to me.
NEUT15|I was looking outputs today when they stopped off around 1415.
NEUT16|I was looking at the 10710.5 but there's so little pricey so I was waiting it out a little more.
NEUT17|I'm looking at July, if not even looking at October puts so I see where the price movements going to go so I'm not overpaying for if the higher it goes the more I can buy these lower ones for better price.
NEUT18|But we'll see how things go, but I'm going to buy puts I'm looking at either July or October.
NEUT19|I look for $10 or 7.5 which would make more sense overall.
BEAR20|Short interest for this has been slowly gaining in January, popped up in general tonight but kind of came down the February with all the news and stuff so kind of died down.
NEUT21|So I think people are just sitting on the sidelines for now and all the bulls are buying this but in the end I think this will fish reality sooner later.
NEUT22|'cause even by market is moving good just doesn't make sense fundamentally.
NEUT23|If you look at everything else with Yahoo Finance is you're.
NEUT24|Bunch of information.
NEUT25|Just saying how like the major players are the major thing and I don't think this will really survive with other ones that might do good for awhile, but I don't really see this in the future so I think they should just focus on the right company, but it didn't seem like there I drugs or anything we're doing good.
NEUT26|Prove me wrong, like Scribe giving all these thumbs down.
NEUT27|I really don't care.
NEUT28|I just want to see what you guys thoughts are on this.
NEUT29|I know that a lot of people just bubble and everything we can just be bullish on everything.
NEUT30|If that's the case and everything would be good but sometimes you gotta be bearish on some things, right?
NEUT31|You guys are really common, like scribe.
NEUT32|Look down on the link below and join your discord.
NEUT33|Overall, let me know what you guys think giving those thumbs down.
NEUT34|"Let's go."""
