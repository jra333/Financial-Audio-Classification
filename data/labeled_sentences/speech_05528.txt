NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol PTON."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume and good respectable volume on the day above average.
NEUT5|So more of the story that I was going to be watching this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that would be the price can now stay up here above the 131 mark.
NEUT8|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 131.
NEUT9|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined, ruined or anything like that, but you have the price.
NEUT10|Could stay above that level.
BULL11|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when you take a step back and just want to measure the health of the overall move, that right there would be defined as the overall move.
NEUT17|Use that purple line to measure the health meaning.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that Purple line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|Best visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yes, staying above 131 would be best case scenario, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned, they just don't matter right now.
NEUT21|What do I mean by that?
NEUT22|What matters the most is what the price.
NEUT23|Has already been doing and that's this right here.
BEAR24|Just chipping away and building those higher lows.
NEUT25|Or if you want to vision those stairs steps.
NEUT26|So in other words, as long as there are steps continue to be constructed in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
BULL27|So focus on healthy consolidations.
NEUT28|Focus on chipping away and building those higher bases and sit back and let the overall trend do its thing.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR35|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
