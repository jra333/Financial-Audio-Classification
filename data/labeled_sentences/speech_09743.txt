NEUT0|"""For joining us is Dan Ives, Wedbush managing director of equity research."
NEUT1|Dan obviously, these earnings don't matter right?
NEUT2|We don't have revenues on either of these companies, So what are investors teeing off of?
NEUT3|What should we be looking for in these results?
NEUT4|Yeah, it's all building the framework for what's going to be the next few years for both of them.
NEUT5|I mean, if you look nicolett about the partnerships from a hydrogen perspective and building out the factory in Arizona, and I think that continues to be steps in the right direction and you look at a.
NEUT6|A Fisker you know did.
NEUT7|This fundamentally comes down to Foxconn.
NEUT8|Some of the partnerships, and I think these are laying the groundwork take a step back.
BULL9|It's a Golden age E. These investors are looking for signs who are going to be the next players, and no doubt Fisker, especially where they stand there going to be one that's going to benefit from this green tidal wave and Nicola, despite the headwinds they've gone through, seems like they're emerging on the other side with some positives.
BEAR10|How significant down was the the fiscal Foxconn?
NEUT11|Announcement the game changer for them because that was the biggest concern from a production perspective and they jumped into the deep end of pool.
NEUT12|Foxconn, which now tangentially with Apple on the EV hunt in terms of going through the EV dating game.
NEUT13|You know that there's a thesis now that Fisker could potentially be involved on the Apple TV initiatives, and when you look at Foxconn, that that's sort of the gold standard, so it's a huge positive for Fisker in in the EV set.
NEUT14|So just talk a stand for the valuations on both of these names when you're looking so far into the future and building on these this momentum that you're getting from announcements like a deal with Foxconn.
NEUT15|Yeah, it's really going to the next 5 to 10 years an looking with deliveries could be what the market looks like.
NEUT16|We believe it's a $5 trillion market over the next decade and with the green tidal wave in the US you will get Fisker.
NEUT17|You know what this could ultimately do?
NEUT18|I mean they they could start to get 345 percent of the share of the EV market and that sort of was looking at.
NEUT19|And then when you look at a nickel it's about hydrogen and there bout to semi truck market and that globally they continue to be a pureplay there.
BULL20|And despite all the headaches we've seen.
BULL21|Investors are betting that they're going to have a big market share, which is going to be a significant market.
NEUT22|That's really the key towards driving these stocks.
BULL23|And potentially your positive ITI as well.
NEUT24|Talking out both names.
NEUT25|Fisker now 6% after hours.
BULL26|Dan thank you Dan Ives, thank you coming.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
