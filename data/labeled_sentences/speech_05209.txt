NEUT0|"""With New York becoming the 17th state to regulate cannabis, it's time to look at some trends in the Big Apple all coming up."
NEUT1|Welcome back to the talking hedge.
NEUT2|I'm Josh Kincaid, capital markets analyst and host of your Cannabis Business podcast.
NEUT3|Look at some projections from headset on New York adult.
NEUT4|Use cannabis sales potentially, or projected to be $1.1 billion.
NEUT5|New York's announcement comes pretty quick on the heels of New Jersey as well as Vermont all happening right after the election where five states were voted.
NEUT6|So this is a pretty quick pace.
NEUT7|To become 34% of all states now have some form of regulated cannabis.
NEUT8|So New Jersey kind of creating that FOMO help in New York make that decision to get out of some debt.
BEAR9|Estimates are going to be maybe 15% lower than previously reported to around 740,000,000 New York.
NEUT10|Obviously going to be generating some cash, assuming that people kind of go back to New York at some point, there's somewhat of a mass exodus, as people were going to Florida and Texas and other places, but some estimates for New York tax revenue estimated around 350,000,000 a year, with the planned 313% tax rate, so that's nine at the state level.
NEUT11|Or at the local level, so that means that there would be a $3 billion a year market once that's fully implemented.
NEUT12|So if we also estimate using Massachusetts as an example, since they both kind of had this same markets both function with medical and then moving into the rec market, we might see New York numbers being similar.
NEUT13|So if we look at the end of Massachusetts, first year of sales, there was 33 operational cannabis retailers.
NEUT14|So New York currently has.
NEUT15|10 operational marijuana medical marijuana licenses, which operate in a total of 38 dispensaries and two more coming soon.
BULL16|So these numbers could be conservative as well because New York, with their population is going to bring in more than New Jersey more than Massachusetts.
NEUT17|But this?
NEUT18|These numbers don't actually include tourism, which I kind of find interesting because it's very conservative, so SMS don't don't include tourism.
NEUT19|Which will likely take some time to resume in full force.
NEUT20|So if they apply those numbers conservative numbers, then the top line sales forecast is over 1.1 billion for the first complete total year of sales.
BULL21|I expect some big numbers from the Big Apple.
NEUT22|Maybe some Apple wrapped terpene infused pre rolls or something.
BULL23|Washington State also has a lot of apples so maybe we can collaborate.
