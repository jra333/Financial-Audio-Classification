NEUT0|"""Yo, we increased what's going on."
NEUT1|It is the end of the year.
NEUT2|2020 is coming to a close.
BULL3|Market is close and we had a very successful 2020.
BULL4|So congratulations to everybody on the team.
NEUT5|It's been a wonderful year, so let's hop straight into it.
NEUT6|The market closed today at 30, seven 5607.
BULL7|Last week we were looking at this and I was looking to see the market approach 3800 and we got pretty close again and we close near the highs once again.
BULL8|So I'm looking forward to starting the year to do a continuation.
NEUT9|Makes perfect sense whenever you close near the highs.
BULL10|Chances are it will continue to move higher so that is the SMP.
NEUT11|Let's go ahead and check out the RI mean the Russell IWM.
NEUT12|So let's check that out high.
NEUT13|M. Anne.
NEUT14|We have the same thing.
BULL15|Last week we're looking at this going towards 200.
BULL16|We had a high of 201 eighteen.
BEAR17|The market started to back down a little bit, so I'm actually looking to be a little bit cautious.
BULL18|As far as this one is concerned because I want to see this continue to move up from the 20 day moving average.
NEUT19|That's going to be the full fledged test to see if the market wants to continue to push, and I think it will.
NEUT20|We have no reason for it not to an we got everybody with stimulus checks come in.
NEUT21|We got a new president.
NEUT22|There's a lot of good things moving in motion, so Mark is going to continue is what I see.
NEUT23|So that's it for this week.
NEUT24|Happy New Year's Eve to everybody.
BULL25|Everyone have a safe New Years and will catch up with you next year.
