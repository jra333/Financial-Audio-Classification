NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Tuesday, March 28th.
NEUT2|I'm Celina Nicholas technical analyst that exam.com today will look at Dollar Yen on the daily chart.
BEAR3|So we can see USD, JPY was relatively flat so far today after hitting a four month low during yesterday's trading.
BEAR4|The short term bias is clearly bearish.
BEAR5|The RSI indicator is below 15 bearish territory.
BEAR6|It's also now approaching 30, which indicates oversold territory below this level below 30 they are assigned.
BULL7|Ticket is still holding close to 30, hasn't fallen yet below it, so it's suggesting some consolidation in the near term for USD JPY so.
BEAR8|Despite the overall negative undertone right now, Dolly and failed to break below 110, so that was a very critical level, critical and important support level and prices managed to hold above it.
NEUT9|A close a daily close, of course.
BEAR10|Below this 110 level would indicate that Dolly and has moved into bearish phase.
NEUT11|And should this support level failed to hold at 1:10?
BEAR12|We see further declines towards the moving average 108.36 and this is expected to act as additional support.
BULL13|So unless we see prices bounce back higher and clear resistance at 112, then.
NEUT14|Only then could the bearish bias turned back to neutral.
NEUT15|So if we move back above 112, we'd enter this neutral phase that took place from January until about last week when prices were trading in range.
NEUT16|Basically between 1:12 and 1:15.
NEUT17|And of course a break above the top of the range of 115 would shift out of the neutral bias to more bullish one.
BULL18|We have a strong bullish run from the 100.
BULL19|Young level area in September all the way up to 118.66 in December and since that bullish run we saw prices consolidate to neutral outlook.
BEAR20|The medium term remains neutral, but in the short term we've turned a bit more bearish, specially after falling towards 110 yesterday.
BULL21|Thank you so much for watching.
BULL22|"Have a great day."""
