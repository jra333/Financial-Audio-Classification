NEUT0|"""What is going on?"
NEUT1|I want to welcome to the stock trans Channel so in this video we're talking bout Pfizer stock ticker symbol PFE.
NEUT2|Now this stock has been in the news a lot lately as this is the company that has come out with the first covid vaccine.
NEUT3|So we want to be doing here today is we want to be talking about Pfizer stock talking about some recent developments and then of course looking at the charts.
NEUT4|So with that said if you would not mind jumping down subscribing to the channel higney thumbs up button we really appreciate that and we're using Weebles platform.
NEUT5|There's a link to get 4 free stocks with Weibel when you sign up and deposit $100.
NEUT6|Take advantage of that while it is still around, 'cause it won't be around for too much longer.
NEUT7|So the first piece of news that we have here is the UK is now becoming the first country to authorize the vaccine from Pfizer for emergency use.
NEUT8|Now the US.
NEUT9|We have gotten the emergency use authorization filed, but it has to still be approved by the FDA, so we're waiting from that and that should be coming within the next week or two here.
NEUT10|And so that's what we're really waiting for.
NEUT11|With Pfizer and a lot of people are starting to play the run up into that potential announcement now.
NEUT12|The announcement is going to come.
NEUT13|The question is going to be.
NEUT14|Yes or no, so we just want you to understand that there is a risk.
NEUT15|Of course, when taking this trade analysis, zoom out and actually look at some of the charts and some technical.
NEUT16|So what we have here is we have pretty much this bottom line here.
BULL17|This trend that we have drawn in that is another night we were developing and it was looking pretty good.
BEAR18|So a couple days back this is actually a pretty decent by here right off the 200 estimate ords.
NEUT19|$36 now we're extending to the upside now when they had the initial news of the vaccine, that's when he popped up here to $42.
NEUT20|Now the question is going to be can we break back above that?
NEUT21|42 and if we do?
NEUT22|Then where do we look to then?
NEUT23|We can probably look into 44 and then 45 based on some of these highs that we had towards the top end of this kind of downtrend breakout that we're looking at here with Pfizer.
NEUT24|Just understand for those who are playing options for those who are playing this stock, you're buying something that is actually a little bit overextended here on the daily chart.
NEUT25|Does that mean anything?
NEUT26|No, 'cause we could certainly see the stock going.
BULL27|Further, there's a lot of anticipation for this vaccine, and with other countries now approving it, that makes it more and more likely in many people's eyes.
NEUT28|For the US to do the same, so will it be a very big surprise if it's approved, no, but if it's not approved, just understand that a lot of people on a lot of traders and investors have now factored this in and so the price that we're seeing right now has somewhat been factored in.
NEUT29|So if we do see the FDA saying, hey, we actually can approve this for emergency use right now.
NEUT30|Oh, you know what we gotta do this?
NEUT31|You gotta do this.
NEUT32|You gotta fix this or blah blah.
BEAR33|Here's why this could bring the stock price down pretty quickly and pretty fast.
NEUT34|So just.
NEUT35|Understand if you're playing options, this news may come out in premarket hours or after hours and you can't act on that.
NEUT36|If you're playing shares or if you're already up on some shares, it would not be a terrible idea to scale out some and then leave some for the potential news.
BEAR37|If that happens, the stock could certainly go to $50.
NEUT38|Plus, we're seeing Moderna making a pretty big run right now as well, so that is an update for you here on a PFE Pfizer.
NEUT39|Right now we are getting up there but now we're looking to target these levels right here or 44.
NEUT40|And then around 45 and 4575, ultimately, before a potential run towards 50.
NEUT41|If that does happen, and the catalyst here of course is the vaccine, I would imagine that we don't get it run towards 50 until we get the approval with the vaccine.
BULL42|If that even happens because upon initial news this stock only spiked a couple dollars when we had the initial news of their vaccine results, so hopefully that makes sense.
BULL43|Hope that was helpful.
