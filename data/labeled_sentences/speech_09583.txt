NEUT0|"""First, before we get to this new thing, which I absolutely love."
BULL1|The housing market is witnessed once again today by the housing stocks would bring out the strongest.
BULL2|The market remains amazing.
NEUT3|An are there still people who are doing it by hand?
NEUT4|Or is the conversion almost?
NEUT5|What percentage is Doc you sign now?
NEUT6|Well, it's pretty significant.
BEAR7|There's still a few out there still.
BULL8|A few Realtors are having come on board.
NEUT9|Remember, that's really the industry that built DocuSign early on, it was the Realtors.
NEUT10|It realized their customers needed to have that kind of a transaction experience.
NEUT11|That could be so much smoother and easier for them.
NEUT12|And they've built this.
NEUT13|But today, even though it's still an important segment, it's a small percentage were not concentrated.
BULL14|Anyone vertical, so it's a small concentration for us, but we're excited and we're, we think it's going to be a robust housing market, and that's going to be good for Doctor Now you talked about.
NEUT15|At Deutsche Bank conference that when you get back in the office, you don't go.
NEUT16|Yes, I'd love to get back to that thing where I type, write a letter and Mail it out.
NEUT17|People cannot possibly go back once.
NEUT18|I mean, I signed a DocuSign today and I can only imagine the nightmare of what it would have been like had it been typewritten.
NEUT19|I had to send it back by him.
NEUT20|I mean, do you see anyone going back to the way it was?
NEUT21|We really don't.
NEUT22|Once people had the benefit of that digital transformation that you talked about Jim and they say it's so much less expensive.
BULL23|It's so much better for their employees and for their end customers.
NEUT24|That experience and everything works so much faster, really.
NEUT25|The speed of business.
NEUT26|We don't think anyone's going to be going back.
NEUT27|It's also very clear, as you say, in a Jeffrey Software virtual conference that we're not going to have 100% of the people we used to have full time in the office.
NEUT28|It's just can't be right and that I'm not talking about covid, I'm just saying it works better at home and a lot of times.
NEUT29|We've seen that for ourselves right now we took all 5000 DocuSign employees and went into a work from home environment.
BULL30|And even though has been challenging, it's changed our perspective on some jobs.
NEUT31|We realize now don't need to be in the office every day, so I think the new normal if that's the right way to think about it, will be somewhere between where we were before covid and where we are right now.
NEUT32|With so few people can get back into the office.
