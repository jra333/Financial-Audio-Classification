NEUT2|It's not about the money flow, and it's about the demand for the loans.
NEUT3|This sounded classics walk economics that the demand for loans really isn't there.

NEUT5|It is and you clearly see you know this was the Fed.
NEUT6|Try not to make any major news, although he did make some news.
