BEAR0|"""The number of companies listed on U.S. stock markets is shrinking."
NEUT1|I'm going to explain what's going on and why it might spell trouble.
NEUT2|So this line shows the number of publicly listed companies in the United States.
NEUT3|The data comes from the World Bank.
NEUT4|It goes all the way back to 1980.
BEAR5|Now, as you can see in 1996, this number peaked around 8000, but since then has fallen to around 4400.
BEAR6|So that's a decline of about 45% in just over 20 years.
NEUT7|So what's happening here?
NEUT8|Well, one thing has to do with private equity.
NEUT9|Now investors are putting a lot of money into private equity firms lately, and that's because they think that it will get them more returns than other markets.
NEUT10|Will private equity firms.
NEUT11|They take that money, and they turn around and buy companies.
NEUT12|So this happened recently with Barnes and Noble the bookseller, which was a public company.
NEUT13|But it was bought by a firm called Elliott Management.
NEUT14|Elliot is actually a hedge fund, but the fact that it's playing around in the private equity space should tell you how much money is going into that space right now.
NEUT15|A second thing that's happening is that companies that could newly list themselves in IPO's don't necessarily have as much incentive to do that.
NEUT16|Firstly, because they can still raise that money.
NEUT17|Like I said in private markets.
NEUT18|Maybe it's a late stage venture capital round or again private equity, but also they don't really have incentive because they are under a lot more scrutiny when their public companies an as a public company.
NEUT19|You have to disclose more information so if they can avoid the hassle and still get the money.
NEUT20|Wireless themselves.
NEUT21|A third reason has to do with mergers and acquisitions, which have been quite high lately and that's pretty self explanatory.
NEUT22|When one company acquires another two, companies have become one and therefore you have fewer public companies.
NEUT23|Now, why is this a problem?
NEUT24|Well, I like to think of the stock market like a pond.
NEUT25|And the companies that are listed like fish.
NEUT26|And the money going into the stock market is like food to feed the fish.
NEUT27|But then one day, let's say you take half the fish out of the pond.
NEUT28|If the same amount of food is going into the pond that these fish are going to eat it, and they're going to get really big.
NEUT29|'cause there's less competition, so this is the same thing that potentially is going on with the stock market, which is that you have fewer companies.
NEUT30|They have less competition.
BEAR31|There's less companies available for the public to put their money into, so the prices of those companies tend to potentially become inflated.
NEUT32|Now.
BEAR33|This is causing a little bit of concern.
NEUT34|Even regulators have talked about it a bit, but frankly the trend isn't going to reverse itself until the public markets become a popular pond for companies to swim in again.
NEUT35|"Until then, they may just get bigger and bigger until they finally pop."""
