BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome to another in GI investing tutorial."
NEUT1|This is parenting technical analysis of ticker symbol USO.
NEUT2|Let's jump right into it.
BULL3|OK guys, today we saw USO up around 1/10 of a percent, closing the day at $25.03.
NEUT4|Now in after hours sitting about $25.11.
BEAR5|We can see that USO has been extremely bullish after reaching those lows.
BEAR6|We saw at the end of April with crude future prices going negative for the first time in history.
BEAR7|So for those of us not as familiar with USO, it can be quite dangerous for retail investors to actually pick the stock up, especially for a longer term hold.
BULL8|And now for the reason I say this is because USO purchases the two front month contracts for oil, and in the coming months those contracts are already inferring that oil will rebound.
NEUT9|So basically USO will be in this continual cycle of buying high and selling low for those contracts.
NEUT10|On the note of if you should buy or sell USO, I'm continuing my hold rating until we have a confirmation in One Direction or the other.
NEUT11|Offer this $25 level.
BULL12|"Thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you in the next video."""
