NEUT0|"""We're going to calculate the stock price for Rogers Communications."
NEUT1|And the first thing we need is the market cap.
NEUT2|Which is 29.3 billion.
BEAR3|And stock price 57 spot 70.
NEUT4|So to figure out the shares outstanding, you just take the market cap divided by the stock price and that gives you 508 million shares outstanding.
NEUT5|Next is free cash flow and the best way to calculate the value of a company is to estimate future free cash flow and discount that back to today's dollars.
NEUT6|That's exactly what we're doing in the video.
NEUT7|OK, and next we need net net income, which is the profit and loss for a given year.
NEUT8|And we use four years of financial data.
NEUT9|And revenue is last.
NEUT10|And now that we have all the inputs, we need to figure out the capital structure of this company so we know what to discount cash flows by.
NEUT11|So let's get the interest expense.
NEUT12|That's the interest on the debt, that's 800,000,000.
NEUT13|And to figure out how much debt they have, let's go to the balance sheet.
NEUT14|In the liability section, we need the current debt.
NEUT15|And the noncurrent that.
NEUT16|So the current debt is 2.2 billion.
NEUT17|And the long term debt is 16 billion.
NEUT18|So they pay 4.39% on their debt, but that is tax deductible, so the interest payments are so we need to figure out the effective tax rate.
NEUT19|So the income before tax is 2.8 billion.
NEUT20|And the income tax is 700,000,000.
NEUT21|So the effective tax rate is 26%.
NEUT22|So when we discount the interest payment, the cost of debt is 3.25%.
NEUT23|Now we need the cost of equity and.
NEUT24|We just can pull the beta.
BEAR25|It's a really low beta .28.
BEAR26|That's one of the lowest I've seen, so the equity is 4.47.
NEUT27|We use the CAPM model to figure that out and across the debt is 3.25%, and when you blend those together, you get 4% and that's a weighted average cost of capital.
NEUT28|That's what we're going to discount the future cash flows by.
NEUT29|So we calculate the future cash flows for years and we did a terminal value which is all the years after year four and when we discount that back to today's dollars, we get a value of the company at $58 billion.
NEUT30|And when you divide that by 508 million shares, you get a stock price of $115.00.
NEUT31|Even though it's trading at $58.
NEUT32|So this is considered by is trading at half of intrinsic value.
NEUT33|So it is harder to value smaller companies or in companies that don't have consistent earnings.
NEUT34|So you do have to make some assumptions and.
NEUT35|And you'll see some analysts saying that.
NEUT36|The stock is by other analysts say the stock sell, but each analyst used their own model in their own assumptions, but you never see them model.
BULL37|"This is my model in my opinion, so thanks for watching."""
