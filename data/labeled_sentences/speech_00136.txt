NEUT0|"""May 4th 2014."
NEUT1|Going to go ahead and hit refresh here so that you can see that this loads and is a normal webpage.
NEUT2|Sunday May 4th.
NEUT3|Going to go to our pick tonight for members.
NEUT4|The pic is integrated cannabis solutions.
NEUT5|The symbol IGP K and let me just refresh this page as well so you can see the date up here at the top.
NEUT6|Also shows it's Sunday night May 4th so this is integrated cannabis solutions trading at $0.17 which was the last trade on Friday.
NEUT7|What we're going to do here is today is Sunday night.
NEUT8|So we're going to come back possibly Monday night, maybe even Tuesday midday and we'll see what happened with this pic.
NEUT9|Hey guys, James Conley back here with the second half of the proof video.
NEUT10|So here we go.
NEUT11|We're at the New York Times webpage.
NEUT12|Today is Monday, May 5th, 2014.
NEUT13|So let me just refresh this so you can see the date and see that this is not faked in anyway.
NEUT14|This is the New York Times Web page with the exact date.
NEUT15|Here we go, Monday, May 5th and we actually came back to this one about one hour into the trading day on Monday.
NEUT16|And you're not going to believe what happened to this pic, so let me go to Yahoo Finance.
BULL17|Going to hit refresh here again and OK.
NEUT18|Integrated cannabis solutions as you remember from the video last night, this stock was trading at $0.17.
BULL19|Now in all fairness, it did open at $0.20, so it did open with a little bit of a gap up, but then it absolutely soared here.
NEUT20|This is actually the day's high so far 300% well, let's just say 250% right here.
BULL21|That's 250% gains in less than an hour.
NEUT22|So obviously this was a huge home run for us here.
NEUT23|We've already taken our position and booked a nice profit, so you know if you look at this, let's just say 250%.
NEUT24|I don't know if anyone got out at 300%.
NEUT25|If they did, Congrats, but we can see it's pretty easy to get out at 2:50 here.
NEUT26|You're looking at $1000 investment turning into $2500.
NEUT27|You know you put 5 grand into this.
NEUT28|That's $12,500 profit off of five grand, you know.
NEUT29|So obviously you can see what the ridiculous potential is here with.
