NEUT0|"""In today's video, we're going to take a look at Disney."
NEUT1|Now.
NEUT2|I've been watching this one for a few weeks because I saw something on the weekly chart that was very interesting to me and that was that.
BEAR3|A couple of these prior declines were very similar to the most recent decline into the low on October 4th.
NEUT4|At one 2754.
NEUT5|OK, if you look at this prior swing, this was $19.90.
NEUT6|This was 1985.
NEUT7|This one was 1961, which is just a little bit short of that, but it doesn't have to be a perfect hit.
NEUT8|We know that the definition of risk on any Langs was initially right underneath this.
NEUT9|127 looks like 30 area.
NEUT10|OK, now if you're not already in Disney, you may be late to the party, but the party is not necessarily over, because if the old pattern is going to continue OK, and that's pretty much just, you know, higher highs and higher lows you get a pullback and you get an extension.
NEUT11|You gotta pull back and get an extension.
BULL12|So if it's going to play out, the upside potential is really healthy.
NEUT13|And even if you just get a deeper upside correction, you know there's still some money in the trade.
BEAR14|Potentially IAM dead wrong if it breaks underneath this support, but if we continue to hold above here, I am going to look for higher prices.
BULL15|Meaningful resistance probably starts coming in around the 136 area anyway, so that's what I'm looking at.
NEUT16|"If you want, you can always look at pullbacks and you don't have to risk all the way to underneath that lastlog."""
