BULL1|The electric vehicle industry has been on fire in 2020 and companies across the globe that are specializing in coming out with F&F related technology have seen their stocks fly higher.
BULL2|One of the biggest winners of the year in the space has been China's NIO, with its share price having soared 970% so far this year.
NEUT3|As of December 4th.
BULL4|However, Nyos year to date gains have been much higher recently.
BULL5|In fact, just last week Nios stock closed with a gain of 1240%.
BEAR6|In just five trading sessions, a drop of more than 20% has cost longtime shareholders in Neo a significant portion of their profits.
BEAR7|Many investors wonder if Niles drop this week is a momentary blip in the F stocks inexorable March higher, or a fit mark?
BULL8|So true reversal in thinking about the company.
NEUT9|Below, we'll look at what prompted this week's move lower and what the future might bring.
NEUT10|Long term investors shouldn't worry, but short term traders should.
BULL11|Ultimately Neo needs to see its business succeed in order to justify the massive rise in its share price.
BULL12|So far the company has done well on Nios three key strategic elements for growth at identified back in July.
BULL13|1st vehicle delivery counts have been on the rise.
BULL14|Back in June, Niall delivered about 3700 vehicles and in just five months, the automaker has managed to boost its delivery pace by more than 40%, regularly hitting new record levels along the way.
BULL15|Second, the new EC Six has gotten a good reception.
BULL16|Deliveries have risen steadily, with 16 in the tiny part of September in which they were available climbing to 883 in October.
BULL17|Novembers X6 deliveries were up between 70% and 75% from October levels and outpaced numbers for the larger S 8 S QV model.
BULL18|Finally, Neo has managed to stay prudent with its capital.
BULL19|In mid November, Nio's third quarter financial report indicated that the company had built up its cash reserves to more than $2.8 billion.
BULL20|That compares to just $1 billion in debt, and that gives Nile the chance to invest in efforts to boost production and meet rising demand for its vehicles.
NEUT21|All that said, those focused on the short run need to be prepared for share price volatility.
BULL22|Niles gains have been justified given its growth, but they've also been big enough that pullbacks are inevitable.
NEUT23|Look down the road.
BULL24|Neo has captured the imagination of many investors in the auto industry, and early investors have been rewarded.
BEAR25|Even a big 20% drop in a week isn't something long term.
NEUT26|Investors should fear.
BULL27|Shareholders should expect bumps in the road, but it still looks likely that Neo will reach its destination and become a powerful force in China's F industry for years to come.
BULL28|Thanks for watching.
