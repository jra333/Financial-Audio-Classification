NEUT0|"""Watercolor shut up."
NEUT1|The investor would put money in the market exactly five years ago.
BEAR2|Got really lucky on Monday, March 9th, 2009, the Dow bottomed out, closing at 6547, fifty 4% below its pre financial crisis high.
NEUT3|So what if you got your money in at the very bottom of the market?
NEUT4|If you'd invested 10,000 bucks in a broad stock market index fund five years ago and left it there untouched to take you to have more than tripled your money?
NEUT5|To around $31,000 if you'd use that same $10,000 on that same day to buy gold, your investment would be a lot less glittery.
NEUT6|Worth around half as much as the stock investment, around $14,000.
NEUT7|If you instead went for bonds, purchasing $10,000 in shares of Pimco's flagship Bond Mutual Fund today, you'd be around the same as you'd be with gold $14,000.
NEUT8|And if you really played it safe, parking at $10,000 in a money market account.
NEUT9|Five years later, you have made a grand total of wait for it.
BULL10|"$26, Congrats."""
