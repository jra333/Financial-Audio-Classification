NEUT0|"""Southwest is wanted to watch in the pre market."
BEAR1|They put out an AK talking about cash burn gym which they brought down to $17 million a day in July.
NEUT2|The previously expectation was for about 18 million twenty million for the quarter.
BULL3|So far on what they're calling modest improvements in revenue trends.
NEUT4|That stock is should be up, not down, because they're talking about declining the government loan.
NEUT5|Gary Kelly.
NEUT6|There we go.
NEUT7|Gary Kelly is extraordinary.
NEUT8|And remember what he said to us, which is that there's really no place to go.
NEUT9|We're getting more, more and more places to go.
NEUT10|And I think anyone who watches sports knows that there are some pockets of the economy that make it so that you want to get on a plane.
NEUT11|A Gary, of course, always been at the Vanguard are saying listen airplane traffic is is safe, but let's wear mass.
NEUT12|I booked an airplane airplane yesterday and I said it's jeez, I find it's a safer place because people wear masks in the air circulates.
NEUT13|He's been at the Vanguard of that.
BULL14|These numbers are very good.
NEUT15|This stock is ready to run.
NEUT16|Huh, so we are.
BULL17|We're betting on an improved I guess traffic season going into the fall.
NEUT18|I think the trajectory is getting very interesting.
NEUT19|I do think part of the problem, but Gary doesn't face it is we can't go to places Italy won't take us.
NEUT20|They'll send us right back.
NEUT21|They know that first hand Spain won't take us unless you have a visa, which is very hard to be able to get.
NEUT22|You have many countries that are saying off limits to us, but that doesn't matter so much for Southwest 'cause it's largely domestic so.
NEUT23|I would not extrapolate this, although of course people will because people just say oh, if Southwest is good, it's kind of great for American.
NEUT24|I say if Southwest is good, is great for Southwest, Gary should: I know you watch this show and he's a true gentleman.
NEUT25|Right, so you think the the domestic travel narrative is intact, right?
NEUT26|Because we know that corporate an international is going to take longer to heal, I would have flown up to see the Phillies.
NEUT27|Just trash Boston last night.
NEUT28|"But then again, everyone else is trash in Boston, so it's not a special."""
