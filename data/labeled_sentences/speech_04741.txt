NEUT0|"""Hey everyone Steven here with canon.com and we just wanted to chime in about current issues and how that impacts."
NEUT1|Our analysis on stocks.
BEAR2|Yes, there is a lot of fear about the flu right now.
NEUT3|The Corona virus.
BEAR4|Yes, there is massive oil overproduction with Saudi Arabia and Russia in a production battle and prices tanking on oil.
BEAR5|All of those things, yes, contribute to downward pressure on stocks, and we've seen massive giveaways in all the markets.
NEUT6|Something that we didn't plan on for 2020, you know we we.
NEUT7|Had it outlook of 2020 being pretty rosy for cannabis and hemp stocks and and it started that way January.
BULL8|We had a lot of gains gaining a little bit of what 2019 took away from us.
BEAR9|But these fears and these over productions have have driven markets down, down, down, and now we're back back where we were at the end of 2019.
NEUT10|So I just want to share our thinking at Canon and what we're looking at in this plot is 45 years of the NASDAQ and all the Gray areas are the recessions.
BEAR11|You can see big big losses for all of these points.
BEAR12|You know that's that's almost 50% loss during these recessions, most recently.
NEUT13|But what is the point that we look at in the technical analysis again and again?
NEUT14|The trend is your friend.
NEUT15|And look at the trend.
NEUT16|There's no mistaking the NASDAQ trend is.
BULL17|Up over 45 years inclusive of six different recessions.
NEUT18|So what are we?
NEUT19|What can we take from this plot we can take that the NASDAQ is going to go up.
BULL20|If you believe that this isn't the end of times, then we can be fairly confident that the NASDAQ will get through this fear.
BULL21|Get through this overproduction and continue to go up and power through this recession.
NEUT22|And so where we left at as investors were left at.
NEUT23|Cannabis and hemp stocks.
BULL24|With higher valuations than there actually selling meaning.
NEUT25|There are 20% discount coupons available.
NEUT26|30% discount coupons available for those smart shoppers.
NEUT27|Wouldn't you rather buy a stock at a 20 to 30% discount than it's true worth now is the time to invest in some of these stocks when there's when they're cheap when everyone else is dumping him when everyone else is selling, we're going to buy these cheap.
NEUT28|We're going to follow the NASDAQ.
BULL29|We're going to power through this, and our investment is going to be rosier at the end of 2020.
NEUT30|So smart people buy when everyone else is scared.
NEUT31|I think there's a saying by Mr Buffett about that.
NEUT32|Be greedy when there's fear out in the market.
NEUT33|And that's what we plan on doing here at canon.com, but continue to read our fundamentals to continue to look at the technicals, and you're going to see those turn around once.
NEUT34|Once the markets get through this.
BEAR35|This cycles of fear that we're caught in right now.
BULL36|"Thank you very much and stay optimistic everybody."""
