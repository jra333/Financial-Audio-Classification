BULL0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to another video from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I'm going panel ACH I'm here to reveal today dividend champions we say veers to come a stock that you will want to own for income in your old age.
NEUT2|That share is Lloyds Banking Group.
BEAR3|I know a shocking thing to say given that this bank has not paid a dividend since the financial crisis broke way back in 2008.
NEUT4|It's paid 0 a year.
NEUT5|Why on Earth would I think that that would be a dividend champion of tomorrow?
NEUT6|Well partly it's because I'm.
NEUT7|Getting old and I remember that before the financial crisis, Lloyd was a great dividend payer used to regular payout over yields of over 5%.
NEUT8|That was because it was a very conservatively run bank.
NEUT9|Didn't really do anything particularly exciting, just borrowed money and that money and paid out a lot of its earnings to shareholders.
NEUT10|That's why people bought it.
NEUT11|They bought for the dividend and for its perceived safety.
NEUT12|Now you might say look where that got them as unpaid dividend for five years it was bailed out by the government.
NEUT13|I think the financial crisis was a particularly strange time, and I also think that Lloyds.
BEAR14|So we've had to cut its dividend, but I think it would have been back into health sooner if it hadn't merged with each person has a lot of what IFS and halves in could've been there.
NEUT15|I fully understand that, but anything we're likely to see another merger of that kind in years ahead.
NEUT16|And if we do, I don't think it's going to be a basket case.
BEAR17|H Plus was much worse than anyone could have imagined, so that's what how old Lloyds put a hole in the in the hole and sunk the ship almost.
NEUT18|But it's Bob back to the surface is not a lot of capital is now returned to profit.
BULL19|Tiny profit, but it's it's returned to profit.
NEUT20|That means it can go soon to the Bank of England and request permission to start paying out dividends.
BULL21|And that is good news for this bank, because that's going to be why people buy in the future.
BULL22|Now this year, it's expected to be given that permission by analysts, and they expect to pad about 1.5 Pence a share.
NEUT23|That is going to be a yield of about 2%, which is not very exciting, I admit.
NEUT24|But next year, that's forecast to rise to about 3 1/2 P. Now there were getting into on the current share price about 4% yield.
BULL25|That's already much nicer and higher than the Footsie, but really, it could go even further becauses Lloyds will be earning about 8 Pence next year and analysts reckon that should the business sort of tick up about 4% loan growth here, the bank will probably end up paying about 70% of its earnings as a dividend to shareholders.
NEUT26|So on 8 Pence next year, that could be about five to six P. That's got five and a half P. It's a yield of over 7%.
NEUT27|And that's not in 10 years time.
NEUT28|That is next year.
NEUT29|So we have to wait a long time for that.
BULL30|"And that you should grow with inflation as loan growth continues to tick up, so you're not going to get a massive payout this year, but I think all the signs are that this is going to be a high yielding bank that income investors are going to want to own."""
