NEUT0|"""Hey it is June 6th Thursday."
NEUT1|Stan Charles was simpletrades.net Weed stock pro and I'm looking at the stock 80 SK.
NEUT2|My market analyzer triggered gave me reasons to click on it.
NEUT3|And then from there.
NEUT4|I can quickly.
NEUT5|Figure out that this would be a good.
NEUT6|Stock for tomorrow.
NEUT7|Or the next day I might not get the signal to enter tomorrow.
NEUT8|But it could be Monday so.
NEUT9|I'm going to check in and see in the next couple of days see how this goes.
BULL10|But just everything is telling me this is going to go higher, so I'm going to see if I can get in.
NEUT11|Make some money and get out.
NEUT12|Alright, let's see how that goes.
NEUT13|Please subscribe to the channel.
NEUT14|And have a great day.
NEUT15|Alright, it's Monday, June 10th and I'm looking at.
NEUT16|ADSK this is a stock I picked, obviously here.
NEUT17|And I said it was bullish.
BULL18|I said it was going to go up.
NEUT19|So I got in on the 7th.
BEAR20|And thing is, is my overextended indicator popped down here?
NEUT21|And I could just tell that.
NEUT22|On some of these rebound trades, I know they're only going to be a one, maybe a two day.
NEUT23|Trade because it.
BEAR24|I know it's going to become overextended and it's going to need to pull back because now I'm looking at the stock and I can tell once it gapped up the distance from here to the moving average is getting farther and farther and you really gotta exit.
NEUT25|So.
BULL26|Yeah, this was a good a good trade.
BEAR27|And but now I think this is going to drop, but overall I still think.
NEUT28|It's going to be more bullish, but anyways doesn't matter.
NEUT29|I got in.
NEUT30|I got out.
BULL31|"And uh, yeah, great trade."""
