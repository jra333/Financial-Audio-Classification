NEUT0|"""Hey Spike and I wanna talk about Berkshire Hathaway."
NEUT1|Because Berkshire Hathaway probably have one of the biggest days of the year for them.
BULL2|I'm just looking at the Class B shares are up over 5%.
BEAR3|As you know, Berkshire Hathaway stock has not been the best performing stock.
NEUT4|However, over you know a long term period.
BEAR5|Berkshire Hathaway stock tends to outperform the S&P when you look at rolling five year periods.
NEUT6|It may not have been the case for the last five years, but just like almost every five year.
BEAR7|Berkshire Hathaway tends to outperform the S&P 500 / 5 year.
NEUT8|And the big day that it had on Monday was really due to the buybacks that Berkshire Hathaway had been doing.
NEUT9|They did $9 billion worth of buybacks during the third quarter.
NEUT10|And what's unusual is that Warren Buffett has usually shunned buybacks.
NEUT11|Hasn't really done any buybacks in the past 40 years, and all of a sudden out.
NEUT12|He did 5.1 million in the second quarter, 9 billion in the third quarter.
BULL13|Who knows if it's going to continue in the fourth quarter, but it's really helping the stock and they even said that they're going to buy repurchase shares at 100 percent.
NEUT14|110% of their book value.
NEUT15|So does this mean that maybe Warren Buffett sees something that there's now a big opportunity in value stocks?
NEUT16|I think there's a possibility.
NEUT17|I mean, you saw yesterday, I just did a video on the Ark Innovation ETF.
BEAR18|That was down 4 1/2% while traditional, more traditional value stocks like Coca-Cola, Exxon.
NEUT19|They're all up, and there's even more value.
BULL20|Stocks that are up, so maybe we're seeing a rotation here.
NEUT21|Who knows?
BEAR22|I I personally do not think like your your basic like your Amazon, your apples and Teslas have become overvalued.
BEAR23|Maybe they just need to pull back a little bit 'cause they've gotten overheated, especially with the big run up we've had in the past five days.
BULL24|However, I will say if you want like a conservative investment, Berkshire Hathaway is a great company.
NEUT25|You're not going to get big performance.
NEUT26|I mean, you look at the year to date.
NEUT27|Let's see it started out at a 43.
NEUT28|It's at 45.
BULL29|I mean, that's a 5% return.
NEUT30|The S&P 500.
NEUT31|For the year, I think if they've returned 5%, let's take a look with it.
NEUT32|It's at three.
BULL33|24350 has returned about 10%, so you gain out performance of the S&P 500.
NEUT34|However, if you if you if you need to sleep at night, you know the Berkshire Class B's or whatever.
NEUT35|You could definitely want to consider using those.
NEUT36|And the great thing is, even though the stock here says 4500, you can buy the fractional shares if you're on Robin Hood or we bowl so you don't have to worry about the big share price.
BULL37|However, it is interesting I I. I wonder if Berkshire will be able to continue to do long term outperformance of the S&P 500 will wait and see, but right now pretty interesting time to look at Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL38|Maybe they'll be able to make a comeback next year since it looks like the SNP is going to beat him this year.
BULL39|Maybe next year they'll do better.
