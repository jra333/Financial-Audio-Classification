NEUT0|"""Yes, Sir, you are reading notes would be hazy back with another."
NEUT1|Let's get right into, you know one another waste nobody time before we do that.
NEUT2|Let's get this video.
NEUT3|Thumbs up so I can reach more people that they will be touching base on Saint signings this ticker symbol Sens we do in the brief summary quick update.
NEUT4|We talked about this talk few times on the channel so we can go too much in details.
NEUT5|We just giving out some reassurance letting you know what to expect short term and long term week since signing stock.
BEAR6|So since Onyx we open today at 3:05 to Hwy 317, the low was 296 that 52 hours, 550 sixty feet to eat lower $0.34.
BULL7|So if we look on the day the intraday chart we got a nice support around 297.
BULL8|We got a nice support around high two 90s but if we breakthrough that 297 and go retested or more.
NEUT9|We could possibly follow.
BEAR10|Who could possibly fall to the low to around low two 60s to 70s before we see a nice pressure if we don't hold the two 6270 we gonna fall straight down towards the 2:30 in the 240 range and the lowest I see this thing going around 2:30 after we hit 2:30.
BULL11|If we get there for this thing could bounce up pretty quickly.
NEUT12|So you want to start accumulating shares the same signage saying sign is most definitely got this unique.
BULL13|Got a unique advantage over.
NEUT14|Their competitors, we do a glucose monitoring system, so we want to keep a close eye on signs.
BULL15|It could most definitely be a big runner and go and retest that high or $5 plus.
NEUT16|So let's look at the what we got in the way before we get there.
BULL17|So we had a high today of what was I had today.
NEUT18|I had a date with $3.17, so that's right around why resistance at we gotta resistance at three 17318 once we bust through at 3:17 is going straight to 328 and 328.
NEUT19|That'll be that's another resistant points around three.
NEUT20|28332 Once we've listed at 3:32, this thing can fly high and go quickly to four to the forest.
NEUT21|424 thirty range and once we reach the force we could easily get back to where he was on a 3 month chart.
NEUT22|Favorite 16 at half $5.27 we could go and retest that and once was in the fires like we would then before we had that market correction.
NEUT23|That's when the big boys would start getting in the large institutions.
NEUT24|They'll start getting in on this, and this thing could easily go from 5 to $10, five to $8.00.
NEUT25|So you want to start loading up in the accumulating shares now?
NEUT26|Because right now in the low and the low tools.
NEUT27|By the time this thing get to five, we don't made a home run and we can sell.
NEUT28|50 percent 75% opposition and ride on signing shares for free letterist on rifle free, so that's all I really got for this video.
NEUT29|Like I said, I just want to give you a quick update that China was going on.
BULL30|Since Psyonix let you know we still bullish on that.
NEUT31|Players will start accumulating as much as you can.
NEUT32|Remember, never go out then.
NEUT33|Don't put in nothing you ain't willing to lose.
NEUT34|This war behaves if you like this type of content.
NEUT35|We post this stuff every single day.
NEUT36|Consider joining the family and we all.
BULL37|God bless you.
NEUT38|"Love yeah."""
