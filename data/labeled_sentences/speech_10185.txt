NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up everybody?"
BULL1|Welcome back to brand new video.
NEUT2|In today's video, we're going to have a look at the VIX stock market and see how the VIX is doing.
NEUT3|And I'm just going to share some of the tips and how they actually managed to goal or have some higher ups in the stock market.
NEUT4|So as you guys can see, I put it in the ears place so.
NEUT5|If you look at 2010, that's when they start going down and look at the exact time in 2019 or 20.
NEUT6|Let's say 2020, and that's when they started going up.
BULL7|And this is good 2009 eight.
BULL8|The suggestion age at 12th of 2008 they had a high jump there.
NEUT9|And.
NEUT10|If we go to the daily ones.
NEUT11|So I'm going to show you guys the daily once and how they're doing actually in dailies so you guys can see daily they're going down and I'm not telling you 100% to buy this stock right now because you don't know what's going to happen after this talk.
NEUT12|After you buy this stock, I'm just sharing this information to show you guys that the stock is going low and if you guys by then if it goes high again you guys can make big profits.
NEUT13|But the people who bought it already, now they can't.
NEUT14|If they sell it, they're going to make.
BEAR15|No profit.
NEUT16|So here I put it in the hours mark and as you guys can see in the last hour, it's at 35.83 and it had a high market around 12:00 o'clock.
NEUT17|Or 11:00 o'clock.
NEUT18|And how high marks?
NEUT19|But it's still not that bad.
NEUT20|And as you guys can see it is at 35.83.
NEUT21|And if people put it back then they can sell right now because they're going to make less profit.
NEUT22|Now we're going to have a look at the summary so summary.
NEUT23|And their previous close was 41.38.
BEAR24|There open was 41.91, their volume was zero and their Danger Ranger still 5.60 to 48.08.
NEUT25|Their 52 week range is 11.42 to 85.47.
NEUT26|That average volume is of course 0 because the other one was there as well.
NEUT27|So now let's go back into the chart and.
NEUT28|What we're going to do is we're gonna go look at the Max and their maximum results and see their Max.
NEUT29|The part where they went really high.
NEUT30|So let's just wait for it to load.
NEUT31|So right there as you guys can see Max.
NEUT32|So that was from 2011.
NEUT33|So if it's still under ears level, just going to wait for this to load.
NEUT34|And if you guys need this much like one and subscribe again.
NEUT35|So it's gonna look there some.
NEUT36|As you guys can see Max, why is it not working all right there said their Max once they went as high as like around 8070.330 and they've been higher than that.
NEUT37|Of course in the previous years, but we're looking at that year's level so.
NEUT38|Ask ask and see that their maximum so 2009, that's when they went high until they made that they were bit low and 2010.
NEUT39|So what we're going to do is look at every year and go scroll to the other side and look at the other ears as well.
NEUT40|Like 2017 eighteen 19.
NEUT41|Jan 23rd, you guys can see this in 20 the third of fifth age went to high at 65.54, so if anyone sell sell their stock then they would make big profit.
NEUT42|"That was it for that difficult but any value out of this much like button subscribe and also in tomorrow's video peace."""
