NEUT0|"""Do you want to look at Scotts Miracle-gro?"
NEUT1|With with his with?
NEUT2|Go on sounds to me, but it's a brand name that we all know, so let's figure it out.
NEUT3|Let's go look at it, Paul.
NEUT4|What is the market cap for Scotts Miracle-gro?
NEUT5|Call it 10 billion.
NEUT6|Just keep it easy.
NEUT7|9.8 will call it $10 billion.
NEUT8|First pillar PE less than 20.
BEAR9|It's an exit 26 right now.
NEUT10|That's fine.
NEUT11|We'll see.
NEUT12|Maybe there's a growth story to it, but it is a little expensive.
NEUT13|It's an X.
NEUT14|How about a pillar #2 is profit margin.
NEUT15|We want that greater than 10%.
BEAR16|So here the last quarter was bad.
NEUT17|So we're going to last full year 9% a little over 9%.
NEUT18|So it's technically gross margin of 24%.
NEUT19|Not that great, but they sell the big stores that they had.
NEUT20|They can't give as much as they can have as much margin to sell the Home Depot, Lowe's, etc.
NEUT21|So that's that's so.
NEUT22|2X is so far.
NEUT23|Let's go to PO #3 revenue growth 2.52 point 62.73, point 14.1, so trailing 12 months.
BULL24|Very consistent growth here.
BULL25|So they've had a lot of growth as my guest in the cannabis section.
NEUT26|This is a definite check mark.
NEUT27|Well, let's go to Pillar #4 is profit growth over the past five years, 315 to 1864 or 6387?
NEUT28|Not very consistent depth still a check mark from 3:15 to 37.
BULL29|The first five years of the decade was very consistent.
NEUT30|Mid one hundreds and then it jumped up.
BULL31|So that's a good sign.
BULL32|We see some revenue and profit growth.
BEAR33|Their number of shares outstanding 61 million down to 56 million.
NEUT34|Check Mark against we have to check more clear on the financial statement.
NEUT35|Killer #6 is current assets grave and current liabilities Paul.
NEUT36|Let's look at current assets 1.2 billion.
NEUT37|It's currently cash on hand roughly and then 9:50 so they have enough by $250 million.
BULL38|We're good there.
BULL39|Yes, that's good.
NEUT40|How about pillar?
BULL41|#7 is free cash flow growth free cash flow growth 185 to 92.
NEUT42|8185 Hundred 1435 is a total divided by 5, so free cash flow averages 287 * 25,740.
NEUT43|So 5.7 billion yeah, market cap is 10 billion.
BEAR44|Yep, so we need to drop now.
BULL45|There is a growth story here.
NEUT46|This is a big growth industry.
NEUT47|If I were going to bet on a cannabis business, it would not be one that's just brand new IT would be something like this that already has a great brand that Scotts Miracle-gro everybody knows.
NEUT48|Scotts Miracle-gro everybody does.
NEUT49|So I like the fact that the leading manufacturer of equipment I like this.
NEUT50|Am I saying bite at 10.
NEUT51|No am I saying bye wait for five point whatever.
NEUT52|No, we need to research this company more and then look at puts for future dates at 125 or so.
BULL53|See we can sell some puts in that range and be able to buy this company a lot.
BULL54|Lower price but great suggestion.
NEUT55|Love the idea behind this.
NEUT56|Still a lot of work to do but I love the growth and the and the fact they're going into a very very big industry.
NEUT57|Well, do you wanna look at the Mendham on Scotts Miracle-gro?
NEUT58|I'm really drawn to this company.
NEUT59|They crossed the Tour de Crossett Funeral Day back in July of $1900.
BEAR60|If you bought back then it would be killing it right now.
BULL61|"So again, the idea behind the momentum is we backtested going back 20 years on 75 companies that have been around for decades and that your day goes well the future day you buy when it goes below you sell and it beat the market by about 1.2% before all taxes and fees."""
