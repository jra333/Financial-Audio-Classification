BULL0|"""Hello buddy, I thanks for watching this quick video on Apple stock market."
NEUT1|So first of all as we can see in front of us is 1 hour candle stick chart showing the price movement and the process being bullish since the end of March or the beginning of April.
NEUT2|Something even more important is that Apple is already overtaken or past the price, the price per share that it was before.
NEUT3|It's before the coronavirus came in so.
BULL4|As soon as school numbers came in, this Apple stock window and now they're down there up again, actually even higher than the share price that it was before the virus.
BULL5|So it's good news.
NEUT6|There's a lot of positive ITI in and these stock right now, and that is to go along even be 'cause based on technical analysis, the prices would be moving inside this uptrend channel, so it's a bullish market, so that is always to invest in them in that direction.
NEUT7|So it's up to and following the merger 10 and then it seems that they are at the bottom of this challenge, so that is that.
NEUT8|Those prices to go up again and based on this technical analysis, there is even the fundamental alesys that backs up this idea suggested by the technical analysis because our police releasing the new Apple card that allows a lot of customers to buy over monthly installments through using this Apple card.
NEUT9|It's like a credit card.
NEUT10|To buy all the Apple products like iPads, Macs and iPods and iPhones?
BULL11|Perhaps, but this is good news that our policy aiming to increase its the selling of those products.
NEUT12|So the idea is that based on this technical and fundamental analysis, the those prices those share prices should go up.
NEUT13|That's all from my side.
NEUT14|"Thanks bye."""
