NEUT0|"""Everybody, thanks for watching this quick video on the Bank of America stock front of us."
NEUT1|There is one hour candle stick showing the price movement of this talk and since beginning of April actually made of.
NEUT2|Ratcheting yes, let me check yes, Middlemarch.
NEUT3|This stock has been moving in sideways condition in a trendless condition, so when the prices are moving in a trendless situation, it's not good to invest because generally we would like.
NEUT4|Actually we are.
NEUT5|We feel safer if we can invest in the trend direction.
NEUT6|In this case there is not render anything direction, it's more it's think it's risky any any type of investment might be too risky.
NEUT7|For us, but let's see what we can say.
NEUT8|Generally, when the prices are moving inside the channel, as in this case, but the first channel was between $2521 and in almost $25.00.
NEUT9|So the idea was went up Jenna when the prices are closer to the bottom flat trendline.
NEUT10|That is too long and by service, so when the prices are close to these top flat line residents line or 25.5 S dollar idea.
NEUT11|Is to go short in this case, I think the best option right now is just all the little bit, even if the idea might be can be to go along, but it's really, really too risky right now because we are in the middle of this channel.
NEUT12|Between 21 you have stolen death, 30 U.S. dollar and as we are right now, the idea is just to hold, but if you are why I give those two options because there is this one is 50.
NEUT13|55% then this one is 45% because the resistance has been broken couple of times because this president has been broken tablet couple times in work as proper assistance as proper resistance level.
NEUT14|So perhaps the idea is this is done.
NEUT15|The reason why I think the prices might go up to 30 U.S. dollar, but it's not.
NEUT16|Again, it's too risky.
NEUT17|Now vote water based on taking analysis.
NEUT18|We cannot say hello today is just world.
NEUT19|For now, and let's see if there will be more signal to go along.
NEUT20|The idea is to go longer is because that sooner or later this stock should start going up, but we don't know when because the coronavirus is still with us and the people get infected.
BEAR21|Keep getting infected, especially in the US, and there are a lot of uncertainity in the in the US Mark special, especially in the US market.
NEUT22|So again in conclusion price moving sideways, we're in the middle of this channel.
NEUT23|The idea is.
NEUT24|Based because the residents levels been broken many times, so that is to go long if you want to risk by from based on our technology, there are not a lot of signals to say that the best option right now is to hold.
NEUT25|Actually the best option right now is just sort of the best option right now is just too old and not to go long.
NEUT26|That's over my side.
NEUT27|"Thanks bye."""
