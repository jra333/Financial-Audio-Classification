BULL0|"""Snowflake is up in the pre market."
NEUT1|A number of firms initiating coverage of the cloud data platform today, Goldman's out with the Buy 268 Target, Deutsche Mizuho, initiating by JP Morgan, is a neutral at 247.
NEUT2|Goldman and JPM were among the lead book running managers for the IPO.
NEUT3|Just last month.
BULL4|Jim Cloud migration and secure data sharing or strong secular tailwinds, says Goldman.
NEUT5|I thought that Goldman's piece was very, very good and now look at that.
NEUT6|I was with some people this weekend, you said, how can you defend that?
NEUT7|How can you defend 100 times sales?
NEUT8|I mean it's ridiculous.
NEUT9|Why can't someone build a better mousetrap now?
NEUT10|The answer for that is that this thing is built for the cloud, but if you look at these Deutsche Bank too, if you look at these reports, it's about how.
BULL11|Really amazing how Amazon's service.
NEUT12|Microsoft Service and Google Services are second rate and they literally do not talk to each other.
NEUT13|And if you want a product that can make it so that you can get instant analysis, instant analysis of your data rather than a day, that's on premise or why then be able to just do.
NEUT14|Some in a couple hours you have to use Snowflake, so you need this to be able to handle your data and the pieces all say the same thing.
NEUT15|Indispensable coral.
NEUT16|This company Frank Simmons company is indispensable out of nowhere.
NEUT17|We don't even know why, but we do know this.
NEUT18|If you if you have to have data instantly, you have to hire Snowflake and everyone wants to say we give somebody a real life example of how this helps a business.
NEUT19|Jim.
NEUT20|I mean I know I'm just throwing that at.
NEUT21|You know that's right, you have a lot of you have a lot of data.
NEUT22|Is stored in Amazon Web Services OK?
BEAR23|Amazon Web Services these analysts say does not have a great system to be able to look at the data.
NEUT24|So what you have to do is you have to look at the data via in the warehouse, so to speak via snow flag and then with Tableau which is Penny Office to find out what the data really means and no wonder that Benioff got so much stock that Salesforce got so much stock.
NEUT25|You know these things if you read through JP Morgan's peace and their mutual on it, you could still see why they like the darn thing.
NEUT26|It is just a better mousetrap and couldn't.
NEUT27|Here's the worry why you wouldn't want to buy it that Amazon wakes up that Andy Jassy says, OK, that's it.
BEAR28|I'm putting these guys out of business.
NEUT29|I'm going to take my my data sale Silo business.
BULL30|I can beat them.
NEUT31|Amazons is 8 years old.
NEUT32|And that's not enough.
NEUT33|You need to be able to run everything simultaneously in all these guys in order to be able to find out what's going on.
NEUT34|And nobody seems to be able to compare to Snowflake in terms of being able to figure out your day to think about your data.
NEUT35|David may mean taking share from everybody.
NEUT36|Alright, alright, so you're in real time.
NEUT37|Your understanding changes that may be taking place that you can then quickly make changes to meet.
NEUT38|Yes, in English customer demand in whatever it might be, and we supposed to even waiting a day which.
NEUT39|But you don't get to be in repair scientists to do it.
NEUT40|That's the other thing that's Lupin has.
NEUT41|You don't need to be.
NEUT42|I mean like you don't need that.
NEUT43|The outlook.
NEUT44|I like altrix.
NEUT45|It's great company which is also easy to use, but what they're doing is they're creating a group of systems now that make it so that regular regular people, not computer scientists, can look through their data and there's still a lot of business that hasn't moved out to Oracle and IBM.
NEUT46|We listen IBM last week and that Snowflake is the winner, so.
BEAR47|They're disrupting a $60 billion data management business, and I think I'm going to put my neck out again.
NEUT48|I think it makes sense.
NEUT49|I think.
NEUT50|I think you can buy it.
NEUT51|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT52|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
