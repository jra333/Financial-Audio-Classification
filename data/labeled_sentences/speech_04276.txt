NEUT6|Does you guys can see it's going up because you know how they took over zoom?
NEUT7|So this stuff is going up at 190.10.
NEUT8|That's great because if people invested in a bit lower spots like around Dallas, still a bit up, but even a bit lower spots that they could make big big profit guys because they don't know how much profit you gonna make until you try it.
