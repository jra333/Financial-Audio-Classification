BULL0|"""You got the L prospect potentially, but we don't see that."
NEUT1|'cause I think you know the amount of monetary and fiscal stimulus is being thrown at.
NEUT2|This problem suggests that you know that won't be the case.
BULL3|I completely agree that you know we've gone too far too fast to be looking at a V shaped recovery between now and the end of the year.
NEUT4|You know, even if we do start sort of edge towards sort of vaccine treatment and you know the global macro picture looks a little bit more optimistic, I think it would be very hesitant about jumping in with both feet.
NEUT5|So I agree it's going to be sort of an elongated youth.
BULL6|I'm not quite sure what alphabet that would have to come from, but you know we will see should have an improving sentiment.
NEUT7|I think over the next couple of quarters you know Q3Q4, but you know, not only is he going to take many months to get ** ES, you know businesses, consumers, you know back feeling confident it's going to take a huge amount.
BEAR8|As we've seen already into $2 trillion from the Fed is going to take a huge amount of debt which will be paying off for generations.
NEUT9|The UK?
NEUT10|That's only just finished off paying its debt from the Second World War.
NEUT11|That was a fraction that was 26 billion.
NEUT12|Pounds or Â£12 million.
NEUT13|Rather a fraction of what we're talking about today.
NEUT14|So so so we might be paying off debt for generations, but in terms of economic recovery, look sort of how it feels in terms of people getting back to work in terms of economic growth.
NEUT15|Getting back to what you can call a normal level, how many months, or maybe even years, do you think the effects are going to be felt?
NEUT16|You know, I think we're going to.
BULL17|We're going to feel improving, so the global growth sentiment coming through in the latter half of this year, I think we will see a rebounding growth.
NEUT18|But pop singer, as I say, not the shape in 2021.
NEUT19|You know the IMF numbers that came out earlier this week.
BEAR20|We're talking about a 3% global recession this year and a 5.8% rebate you at 8.8% rebound to a + 5.8% global growth next year.
NEUT21|I think that might be a little bit optimistic.
NEUT22|I think you know, but given once we've removed the coronavirus, which is a medical into transit rates.
NEUT23|Constraint on market sentiment.
NEUT24|Once you remove that in the context of zero rates, use fiscal policy.
BULL25|You know you're going to be in a much stronger position for risk assets to perform very nicely over the over the course of 2020 one 2022.
