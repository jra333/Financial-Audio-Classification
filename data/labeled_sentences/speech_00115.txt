NEUT0|"""I'm just grabbing Stacy here."
NEUT1|Of course the head of the New York Stock Exchange, Stacy Cunningham joining US and Stacey, we've had a halt here for 15 minutes.
NEUT2|You want to explain what the market is doing right now?
NEUT3|What the traders are doing?
NEUT4|Yeah, the market right?
NEUT5|Circuit Breakers are designed to slow trading down for a few minutes to get investors the ability to understand what's happening in the market, consume the information and make decisions based on market conditions.
NEUT6|It's a plan that's put in place for situations like this.
BULL7|It's been tested.
NEUT8|We tested every quarter, so this is operating as it supposed to, and the important thing is that.
NEUT9|This is not meant to change any of the fundamental facts that we're dealing with this virus.
NEUT10|At the purposes, soup allow the trading community to seek liquidity.
NEUT11|Yes, and and to give investors a time to absorb information and respond, and so that's really what it's designed to do an it's operating as as planned and it's really, you know, a precautionary measure that we put in place so that the market can slow down for a minute.
BEAR12|We like to say earlier that these these trading halts.
NEUT13|The circuit Breakers have a very long history.
NEUT14|They go back in the late 80s with the.
BEAR15|The big crash in October 1987, when it dropped 22% but it's changed over the years.
NEUT16|It used to be, of course, a point system.
NEUT17|Now it's gonna percentage system used to be the down.
NEUT18|Now it's the S&P.
NEUT19|So the most recent update was 2013.
NEUT20|These are continuously updated, correct as markets evolve it gives us the opportunity to take a step back and see how things changed and how does the industry want to come together to provide even more resiliency during times of stress.
NEUT21|So after August 24th, 2015 we made a number of changes designed just for conditions like this.
NEUT22|And the important thing here is the.
BEAR23|Marco, Halt down 7%.
NEUT24|It's going to reopen very shortly in a couple of minutes.
NEUT25|There are other trading limits.
NEUT26|Halts at 13%, so the next level it wouldn't stop.
NEUT27|At 7% it would go all the way out in their building up the whole 13.
NEUT28|Another pause, another moment to catch your breath and then reevaluate.
NEUT29|That would be in place until 3:25 and after that there's no halt and less you drop 20% or more, correct, correct?
NEUT30|Yeah and of course these these systems changed over the years.
NEUT31|The important thing is we'll wait here will be here on the floor.
NEUT32|Stacy will be here and she's been walking around talking to the traders.
NEUT33|Will be opening in just a few moments here in Stacy.
NEUT34|I know you're going to be Bob.
NEUT35|Over the years.
NEUT36|We've seen you know, way back when we've triggered these before and the markets continue to operate.
NEUT37|It's a long term to long term market for investors.
BULL38|OK, Stacy, thanks very much.
NEUT39|"I know you'll be around guys will be down here on the floor monitoring the action."""
