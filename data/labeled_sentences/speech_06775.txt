NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video traders."
NEUT1|And if you're new to the channel, welcome to charting trends for Tesla.
NEUT2|I'm TJ, we got a great video for you today, but before we get into that, make sure you like this video and subscribe to the channel.
NEUT3|Hi, let's take a look at the chart.
NEUT4|Here's the chart for Tesla.
NEUT5|We're on a 10 day 10 minute chart here.
BEAR6|Today we fell about 20 points and the indexes were very flat.
BEAR7|Well they ended very flat.
BEAR8|There are a little bit up and down and I think people are just a little bit nervous because the SNP is so high right now.
BEAR9|So at the open we just had some weakness.
BEAR10|We fell through the top of the growth trend channel, eventually working our way all the way down to bounce off of the support at 669.
NEUT11|And we're holding around 671 now and after hours, and we're going to look at SPY.
NEUT12|Just really quick.
NEUT13|This would be a short video.
BULL14|'cause it's not a whole lot change from yesterday.
NEUT15|My TOS is moving a little bit slow right now.
NEUT16|Alright?
NEUT17|Here's the chart for spy.
BEAR18|And as you can see that pass two days or so have been very flat.
BEAR19|You know a couple Upson Downs, but we're pretty much closing right around where we open where a .12% today and you know we're right around this all time high 407 from yesterday.
BEAR20|So I think people are just a little bit nervous expecting a bit of a pullback.
BEAR21|Especially since you know there's there's quite a gap to fill from this move that happened Monday.
NEUT22|We just kind of went straight up from 400 to 405 and.
NEUT23|You know, so we closed here after honestly ending the day right around 400 here and then.
NEUT24|This was all after hours movement straight up at the open.
BEAR25|So there's quite a gap here and that makes me a little nervous being around the all time high just makes you feel like a pullback is imminent.
NEUT26|So I think people are just kind of waiting to see what happens.
BULL27|And of course Tesla, we really need to strengthen both indexes to move up when the S&P isn't moving in the right direction.
NEUT28|Tesla starts to fade and you know, so here was the move the other day with the market and then since then we've flattened out and started to fall back into supports today.
BULL29|So I would say we're still kind of seeing that consolidation that I've talked about earlier this week should be around the 695 level, which means maybe we'll get a little bit of a bounce tomorrow or Friday.
NEUT30|As long as the markets keep doing what they're doing, if they start to pull back, that's another story.
BULL31|If they start to push up, Tesla should be pushed along with them, but As for now, with the markets not moving, I expect to see consolidation around the 695 level.
BULL32|Probably go up and hopefully test this top of their growth channel again tomorrow, and I think we're going to see a little bit of consolidation around this level.
NEUT33|Like we said before, we eventually pull back and theoretically eventually pull back all the way into the bottom of this growth channel at some point.
NEUT34|But the market is really going to determine the timing on that, so we just gotta keep watching the chart and wait and see if we can get some upward move it on the S&P and the NASDAQ to pull Tesla along with it.
