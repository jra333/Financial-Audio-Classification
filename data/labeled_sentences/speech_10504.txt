NEUT0|"""Yeah, I really think that we have to go back just a couple of months."
NEUT1|An recognize that even if we had any hope that there would be a successful vaccine, why don't maybe 7080%?
BEAR2|I'm 50 to 60 for the flu is something that we've learned I was critical of Moderna, the insider selling was bad.
BEAR3|Well, it turns out the insider selling was bad, meaning that they sold badly.
NEUT4|I do think that what what's happened here.
NEUT5|So we have kind of vaccine Monday, David, where we have merger money vaccine Monday, and I think that next is going to be on.
NEUT6|Not RNA is going to be Astra Zeneca David.
NEUT7|You continually, I think wait for what we really need is the bridge is not just miss the bridges therapeutics and that's something we haven't been good at now and it looks at this point as though Jim the vaccines are going to be out before we get real therapeutics.
NEUT8|Now, Eli Lilly's monoclonal antibody has been already approved for emergency use, but there's not a lot of it available right when you're talking about 100 and 5000 and 60. Who knows, 200,000 cases we may have pretty soon a day.
NEUT9|That's just not feasible, because that's supposed to be infused early to avoid any real complications.
NEUT10|Jim, so the hopes for antivirals preceding an being that bridge to a vaccine.
NEUT11|I don't know.
NEUT12|They'll still be out there though, when a lot of people are not vaccinated and therefore still be available in that same time.
NEUT13|When we're starting to vaccinate people, but other people are getting sick.
BULL14|Hopefully the antivirals will be available then, so that really weak and a lot of people can feel a lot more comfortable in terms of leading.
NEUT15|A normal life again, right?
NEUT16|Mean coral.
NEUT17|I think that when we see numbers like today, what happens is the airline stocks immediately go up and the hotel stocks in the retail stocks.
NEUT18|And then what happens?
NEUT19|Well, Norwegian cruise.
BEAR20|The numbers are cut because there won't be any sailing till March, not January American drop some very key and lucrative routes.
NEUT21|So the younger buyers and I do think that the younger buyers who can't wait and have to buy it 4:00 AM five AM 6:00 AM are they just are so enthused and then the facts come?
NEUT22|And the facts just don't fit the story.
NEUT23|They do make you feel like it will eventually be good call, but I just don't get the sense that we're going to go on a cruise in the next four months.
NEUT24|I just don't think so, yeah.
BEAR25|Although you know Fidelity did some charts last night looking at the Goldman Baskets, the reopening basket, the stay at home basket and the stay at home is hitting lower highs and the reopening all the way behind is trying to catch up.
NEUT26|Well look.
NEUT27|I think there are a lot of companies that are going to adjust you see a stay at home company.
NEUT28|They can.
NEUT29|They can do different things and not just sitting there and saying OK listen I want to take a beating now.
NEUT30|Palatine doesn't have much of a chance.
NEUT31|I think Netflix does if they do the right product.
NEUT32|I have teledoc ones.
NEUT33|Later this week, I don't think Teledoc is something that comes and goes.
NEUT34|You may say it's inflated DocuSign with a great deal with Zoom.
NEUT35|I don't know.
NEUT36|I think there are.
NEUT37|These are things that are here to stay.
BULL38|David, I do not hear anybody saying you know what we're going to return to the heyday of when we put people on planes and spend a lot of money because the gross margins have been terrific for a lot of companies that can do things by zoom.
BULL39|There's no doubt that a lot of companies have had been able to save a great deal of money on Tenian on travel on so many of those things.
NEUT40|As you say, for some companies it you know it barely moves the needles, for others it is a major savings.
NEUT41|Jim Ann.
NEUT42|As we've said many times, listen, we can all sit here and still talk about what things will be like when the coronavirus hopefully and thankfully is gone or at least neutered.
NEUT43|But you know, we don't know, but I think we can assume fairly that travel will not be business.
NEUT44|Travel will not be back to the levels it was in 2019.
NEUT45|Perhaps not ever or certainly not for a long period of time.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
