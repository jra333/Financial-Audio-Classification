BEAR0|"""Falling commodity prices have been treated as one of the clearest indications available that China's resource hungry economy is slowing."
BEAR1|Yet the latest data on metals consumption paints a more nuanced picture, showing that demand is not as bad as perhaps prices suggest.
BULL2|HSBC, for instance, estimates that Chinese copper demand rose by 1.8% last year.
BEAR3|Not great, but not horrible either.
NEUT4|In absolute tons, China is still consuming a large proportion of the Earth's raw materials, especially metals.
NEUT5|For instance, China consumes over 40% of the world's copper.
BEAR6|No other country comes close, but it is a slowdown in the rate of growth that is alarming.
NEUT7|Some market participants part of that is due to the incredible surge in growth and commodity demand that took place in China over the past decade.
NEUT8|Are eight probably unprecedented in human history?
BULL9|That rate of growth was especially stunning for the world because during that.
NEUT10|Demand for commodities such as metals in the western world barely grew at all.
NEUT11|So nearly almost all of the growth in global demand came from China.
BEAR12|That led to many fears at the time that the world would even run out of resources or the China would grab them all.
BULL13|Partly in response, miners invested billions of dollars in new supply.
NEUT14|But a lot of that supply was based on projections that the double digit growth rates in China will continue as the country continues to urbanize.
BEAR15|"But that's not happened and say prices, which are of course driven by supply as well as demand have collapsed."""
