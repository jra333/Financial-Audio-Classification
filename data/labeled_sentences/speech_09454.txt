NEUT0|"""CNBC is out with a new Fed survey taking a look at expectations for growth this year."
NEUT1|Steve Liesman back at HQ with the results I see.
BULL2|Hey, good morning, Sharon.
NEUT3|Let's take a look before we look at the growth numbers.
NEUT4|Look at the stock numbers.
BULL5|Good news is they think these gains continue our 43 respondents, fund managers, strategists and economists.
BEAR6|Bad news is gain some here are seen as modest and there is some concern about overvaluation in the market.
NEUT7|We took yesterday's 3250 the outlook for 2020, thirty 365.
NEUT8|When it comes to the S&P 500.
NEUT9|And 3414 for 2021.
BEAR10|All of this comes with a relatively low bond yield, 2% for the 10 year in 2020.
NEUT11|Forecast going up to two and a quarter by 2021.
NEUT12|So are these high numbers.
NEUT13|Extremely high numbers?
NEUT14|Take a look we asked relative to your outlook for earnings and your outlook for growth.
NEUT15|Where is the market right now?
NEUT16|15% stays extremely high, 51% say it's somewhat high, 32% say just right and not a lot of people say it's somewhat or extremely low, so you can see where the perception is that the risk is in the forecast right here.
NEUT17|The outlook for stocks.
NEUT18|Take a look at the outlook for the Federal Reserve.
NEUT19|Here.
NEUT20|100% say rate hold in January, 49% expected rate cut in November, 49% expected rate cut and the average is November 2020.
NEUT21|When that would happen.
NEUT22|32% say the next move is a hike.
NEUT23|And the average is March 2021.
NEUT24|Bottom line is they think they're going to be on hold for about a year.
NEUT25|Jim Bianco, president, Bianca.
BULL26|Research, writing in response to our survey stocks have run ahead of an expected rebound in earnings that is needed to sustain the rally and art.
NEUT27|Hogan writes in quote.
BULL28|We think that the market is under appreciating the amount of uncertainty that is dissipated with the US China trade issues.
BEAR29|We could see a closing of the gap between corporate and consumer confidence that should manifest in a pickup in cap ex.
BULL30|And the potential for better than consensus economic growth.
NEUT31|In 2020, so Speaking of growth, the survey says 2% pretty much 2% this year and 2% next year with a 2% funds rate and just under 2% you get in the picture there Sarah 2% two percent 3%.
NEUT32|But I think that 2%, as you noted, raises a question about whether the next move is a cut or a hike.
BEAR33|An feels like your respondents are pretty split.
NEUT34|So like I said, yeah exactly, and I will tell you that when we look at.
NEUT35|The median of when the Fed will next act.
BULL36|It is gone up from six months into the future.
NEUT37|In the December survey to 12 months into the future in this survey.
NEUT38|"So they really think that the Fed is on extended hold here Sarah, which means, you know, put your feet up, get out your popcorn and your Gatorade and have some fun."""
