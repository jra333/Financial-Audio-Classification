NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint, I do own Amazon in my retirement accounts from the long side, so just keep that in mind as they go through the analysis.
BEAR5|Well, a nasty nasty move today.
BEAR6|Now granted, it was a nasty move for the markets as a whole, so it's not like the markets were booming and then Amazon was having this sort of day, but you know, overall markets or not, it was a rough day and updates definitely need to be made.
NEUT7|So I'm going to go ahead and just adjust this green line down here.
NEUT8|Yeah, this line up here.
NEUT9|It still pertains to the chart.
NEUT10|It's just not relevant right now.
NEUT11|And from our presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion.
NEUT12|'cause there's lines are very luck, but this area now I'm going to move down here to this gap closed location is that's really the main area of support.
NEUT13|Now to watch going forward right there at 2960.
NEUT14|Now do gaps have to close?
NEUT15|No, nothing has to happen in the market.
NEUT16|I mean, think about that.
NEUT17|If a gap had to close loud, imply that there is a such thing as guarantees in the market, and I assure you there is no such thing as a guarantee in the market other than the market wants to punch you in the face.
NEUT18|But besides that guarantee nothing but the pointer being 2960 is going to be that main area of support because it is a gap closed location.
NEUT19|So yeah, gaps do close a lot, but do they have to?
NEUT20|Absolutely not.
NEUT21|So keep an eye on that and then in the very very near term, the level that I'm curious about is that purple line there, which on my chart here denotes the very well known, the very famous.
NEUT22|50.
NEUT23|Moving average and you can see you know, surprise, surprise after the price fell and fell and fell off center to go sideways right at that level, so we'll see what happens with it and see if the price can say above there.
NEUT24|But if it does and at that point you know 2960 would be the next key area of support to watch closely.
NEUT25|Now in the event the prices sides at once all of a sudden snap back around and work its way back higher.
NEUT26|First key area of resistance to watch any sort of attempted movement back is going to be right there at 3050 and then also next.
NEUT27|I'm just going to leave at 3050.
NEUT28|Actually, now that I talk about it out loud, 'cause in my opinion right now top priority right now is not necessarily breaking levels of resistance, more so about trying to stabilize out and you know, then bounce upwards.
NEUT29|Then you can focus more.
NEUT30|So on those areas of resistance.
BEAR31|But yeah, overall a rough day.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird.
NEUT37|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT38|But in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
