NEUT0|"""Now, once you check out this daily chart of the dollar index on its own right, now it's trading right above a major for support at 93."
NEUT1|Meanwhile, the relative strength index RSI and the Williams percentage R oscillator, and those are both key important momentum indicators.
BEAR2|Both show that the dollar is oversold.
NEUT3|OK, so you get the dollar oversold really oversold, meaning it's come down too far too fast, so you could argue it's due for a bounce is typically what happens, but garner points out that 93 is still pretty high on an historical basis.
BULL4|If the dollar index holds above 93, she says golds finished.
BEAR5|If it breaks down below that level, she thinks the next stop could be 2018.
BULL6|Lows of 88 gold can have another leg higher, maybe a big one.
NEUT7|I know that's problematic thing 'cause it says it could be big either way, but so let's keep delving into this.
NEUT8|I want to zoom out and look at the monthly chart of gold.
BEAR9|The last time the precious metal exploded higher like this in July of 2011, the rally went nearly parabolic.
BEAR10|Democrat that blow off top in August as the debt ceiling crisis was resolved.
NEUT11|That pattern holds.
BULL12|Garner says the gold markets likely in the process of setting up a reversal, although again, gold won't peak until the dollar bottoms.
NEUT13|That's the takeaway of this.
BEAR14|Still is pretty overbought relative strength index in the monthly charges approaching 83, which is very high.
BEAR15|The Williams percentage R oscillators almost maxed out at 99 and that's just way too high.
NEUT16|Card points out that these levels are totally unsustainable over the long run.
NEUT17|Just totally.
NEUT18|But in the short run they can convert even the most bearish bears.
NEUT19|For example, if you sold gold and they are so I went above 80 in 2011 and you can see this right here.
NEUT20|We are, so I went above 80.
NEUT21|Well you missed a $300 gain before the peak, alright, and that's you know you wanted to make that.
NEUT22|Get that money and it's not just 2011 garners notice that the precious metal tends to rally $340 right before prices implode.
NEUT23|Wow, problem is, she's not wear sure exactly where we are in the pattern.
BULL24|If it looks like the peak in 2008, then gold could rally to 1980.
NEUT25|Right here, OK or 2000 before it runs out of steam up just one or two percent from here.
NEUT26|Not worth being involved, but if this isn't 2011 situation, Garner could see gold soaring through 2250 or even 2300 before it peaks.
BULL27|That's fabulous.
NEUT28|15% to 18% move at the moment she thinks the former situation is more likely, but if we get one more massive run you need to understand that will likely be a quick probe hire that doesn't last very long when a gold boom goes bust.
BEAR29|It gets really ugly once the meltdown stars garner things.
BEAR30|We could trade down in 1525 or 1450.
NEUT31|I mean you may not mind that because if you like gold like I do, you may just say OK, that's the price of entry.
BEAR32|Maybe down to 1300 if we go all the way down to the uptrend support 1300 be obviously painful but I believe the 10% of your assets should be angled.
BEAR33|One more thing the August cold options expire today and speculators we've forced out the August gold futures by the end of week.
NEUT34|Carter points out that these expirations can brew some wild action, often a major extension of the previous trend will followed by a big reversal.
NEUT35|And this thing about, well, right men, went to minus 37.
BEAR36|Now be a rapid rally and then a sharp decline.
BEAR37|So I need you to watch out and I've been really bullish on gold so I even myself tempering tempering my feeling.
