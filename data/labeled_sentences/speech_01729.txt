NEUT0|"""One of my."
NEUT1|Favorite of companies to talk about?
NEUT2|I'm sure it's out of favor right now, so the person talking about Berkshire.
NEUT3|Is probably someone who's looking for value guys, here's the deal.
NEUT4|People said Buffett was done duringthe.com bubble in 2000.
NEUT5|They said he's done he's he didn't he?
NEUT6|He doesn't know how to invest today.
NEUT7|That's what they were saying.
NEUT8|He doesn't understand what the market is today.
NEUT9|He's he's not.
NEUT10|He's not equipped for it.
NEUT11|He's old, you know.
NEUT12|He was old 20 years ago too.
NEUT13|He was 70 years old.
NEUT14|And guess what?
NEUT15|The.com bubble burst and Berkshire in that time, right?
NEUT16|So people that were holding.com stocks they got they got.
NEUT17|This OK if you were.
NEUT18|If they were holding like thebubble.com stock.
NEUT19|So what I would say today Nicola.
NEUT20|What's the other one that I just SPAC just a bunch of these?
NEUT21|These real bubble ones, right?
NEUT22|So they went to this right by today, so if you invest 20 years ago in the.com bubble, you probably got like I don't know, 10% of your money back, maybe 30.
NEUT23|Let's say 100% of your money all your money back, right?
NEUT24|You invested $10,000 into the.com bubble, right?
NEUT25|At the peak or near the peak you got in, let's say today you have 100% of the money back.
NEUT26|'cause maybe some of it was in Amazon.
NEUT27|OK, 'cause Amazon was a popular stock back then.
NEUT28|It was one of the popular Internet stocks.
NEUT29|OK, so let's say you got you got all your money back but the rest of it was lost.
NEUT30|So you got all the money back.
NEUT31|But what happened to Berkshire right?
NEUT32|People were saying, Berkshire, you know, buffets done Berkshires not doesn't know how to invest in the Internet that he talks about it.
NEUT33|He doesn't listen tech.
NEUT34|Here's the thing.
NEUT35|In 1999 the A shares of Berkshire BRK.
NEUT36|A sold for in September of 19 that, let's say March of 2000, right?
NEUT37|Right when the bubble started to burst $58,600.
NEUT38|That's what if you bought it.
NEUT39|Few help Berkshire then that's where you got it right?
NEUT40|And then today that's worth $280,000 this year.
NEUT41|So if you put that $10,000 into Berkshire, that $10,000 would have turned into $50,000 today, wherein if you invested in the bubble during the bubble, you would have gotten maybe your money back by today.
NEUT42|Which is 20 years later.
NEUT43|So understand that.
NEUT44|So my view on Berkshire's buffet is the best investor of our time.
NEUT45|So is Charlie Munger?
NEUT46|They're both amazing, right?
BULL47|They are setting this company up for success.
BULL48|They've been setting this company up for success.
NEUT49|OK, they talk about it.
BULL50|They talk, they say that Berkshire is going to beat the market, but not by much.
NEUT51|So there's like one or two percent they think it will be the market.
NEUT52|These are the smartest investors of our time.
NEUT53|These are the guys that you know these are.
NEUT54|These are the goals these are.
NEUT55|This is Michael Jordan.
NEUT56|This is LeBron James.
NEUT57|This is Kobe.
NEUT58|This is.
NEUT59|Babe Ruth this is the Babe Ruth of emotion OK?
NEUT60|He bats very well and let me tell you something.
NEUT61|I wouldn't bet against him.
NEUT62|I don't even understand how to how to how to value Berkshire.
NEUT63|It's I can't look at understand insurance.
NEUT64|Understand banking.
NEUT65|I don't understand a lot of its Holdings.
NEUT66|I just don't.
NEUT67|But I understand that Warren Buffett is the best, the most of our time.
NEUT68|"That's what I understand."""
