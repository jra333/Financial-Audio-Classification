NEUT0|"""Point you say talking about the applications that will start to see built on these things."
NEUT1|Where is the killer dapp?
BULL2|Because at the moment I'm still hearing Oh well, crypto kitties was really successful.
BEAR3|I'm sorry that was a 2017 story, Anne.
NEUT4|How much we're going to start to see these Ethereum and the likes of the blockchains being built upon with interesting applications.
NEUT5|I mean the initial use case is still money, right?
NEUT6|If Bitcoin or whatever the winning cryptocurrency is, captures just a quarter of offshore banking and emerging market Fiat currency.
NEUT7|Reserves then it's a $10 trillion asset just by itself.
BULL8|So in some respects that's a big enough opportunity for the near term.
NEUT9|And if you look at something like Ethereum, it's much, much younger.
NEUT10|The public blockchain is only been around since 2015, that's three years versus 10.
NEUT11|There's that much less infrastructure build that's had a chance to happen just just based on sheer time.
NEUT12|Well, let's just focus on the Ethereum slash smart contracts part of the world is.
NEUT13|Any of it working or even close to working or getting anywhere close to meaningful adoption.
NEUT14|Yes and no.
NEUT15|I'd say I'd say today very, very few, but what we did see in 2017 in the run up was Ethereum.
NEUT16|Ether itself became a reserve currency almost for a distributed investment bank.
NEUT17|So if you think of Bitcoin as a reserve currency for distributed central Bank, the run up that we saw last year was largely fueled by these Ico's and the billions of dollars that were invested without permission from the SEC or any other international equivalents.
NEUT18|Now you can argue about the merits of those assets that raised money.
BULL19|But ether itself proved its value.
NEUT20|Ethereum proved that it could be this censorship resistant form of capital allocation.
NEUT21|The only other one currently which I already mentioned is probably maker, which is it fully collateralized stable coin that's built entirely on the Ethereum blockchain.
NEUT22|But we're still light years away from any anything even remotely resembling mainstream adoption.
NEUT23|For those, even for something like Bitcoin, well, how do you define light years?
NEUT24|You mentioned the idea of a 25% of offshore reserve assets.
NEUT25|The Chinese Yuan has been now.
NEUT26|Reserve currency for about three years and it's got about 3% and it is used by people in the in the actual economy so.
NEUT27|I think I think we look at the long tail of currencies in national currencies, right?
NEUT28|So Argentina, Venezuela, African countries, right?
NEUT29|If you if you aggregate the bottom 150 or so currencies, you have to imagine that many of them are to use the dollar or something pegged to the dollar were pegged to gold's.
NEUT30|If you have that emerge overtime to an mpesa like international reserve currency, that could look something like Bitcoin or a derivative of it, right?
NEUT31|Like let's get back.
NEUT32|So I think this is really important to understand because cryptocurrency will not be profitable and a lot of this is speculation until this adoption will come.
NEUT33|So if you are going to invest in cryptocurrency or when you should invest in cryptocurrencies when you see this actually occur, and like they've stated it's light years away.
NEUT34|"And to figure out when it's closer than lightly years away, I would highly recommend just educating yourself, reading, researching the news and subscribe to this channel and I'll try to keep you guys up to date, but let me know your thoughts on this and I will talk to you soon."""
