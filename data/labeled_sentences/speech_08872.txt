BEAR0|"""Guys I was not planning on Mickey View today but the breaking AMC news that just came out is just too good to miss."
NEUT1|So if you guys are just as excited as I am, please do not forget to leave a like tell me subscribe and let me know down below how many shares you have in AMC, whether you even have a stake at all.
NEUT2|If you have those diamond hands and if you are ready for this amazing squeezed as incoming.
NEUT3|So guys the breaking news that just came out on Fintel and I borrow desk that AMC now has an Immaculate 10.3%.
NEUT4|Short interest borrow rate.
NEUT5|We literally saw only 1% a couple weeks ago and now we're at 10.3%.
NEUT6|These hedge funds have to pay for every short decide to purchase.
NEUT7|Like guys, this is insane.
NEUT8|If you guys didn't know the short interest, borrow rate is the amount of interest that use hedge funds or anyone designed to short the stock has to pay.
NEUT9|So whenever you see the short interest bar rate increase, you can see how the market makers are seeing how a certain stock has a lower chance of actually going down, indicating and hinting out to these hedge funds that it probably is not a good idea to continue shorting the stock.
NEUT10|As they sort of view and predict that AMC or any other stock that is currently in this situation is bound to go up and go to the moon.
BULL11|And so guys, the fact that the short interest bar rate is at such a high number at the moment kind of shows us that we're going to see something soon, something that's probably really good and in our favor.
NEUT12|And I also want to mention to the sort of technical analysis behind AMC how we are currently in that stage of a Cup and handle formation where you can have.
NEUT13|A Cup and then you have a handle that indicates a sort of bullish territory and at the moment we're in that stage of trying to fill that handle and from there, if you're able to fill that gap, we are bound to go to the moon.
NEUT14|Guys.
NEUT15|In my opinion, I feel that everything is lining up.
NEUT16|All we need to do is continue staying patient, having those diamond hands continue buying the dips and holding on until we see that squeeze, but I just want to say disclaimer, my information could be 110% wrong.
NEUT17|You guys should take.
NEUT18|I think from what I say with a grain of salt, you should ultimately make your own financial decisions, your financial choices, and understand that this stock could either go up or just go down as fast and you guys need to understand that you should always just put money into the stock that you're going to lose, as this is a completely risky play, but you guys that is just a quick update on AMC.
NEUT19|I am super excited to see how this plays out.
NEUT20|If it continues consolidating, I will continue buying those dips and holding.
NEUT21|On until we see this moon and squeeze that we've all hoped for.
NEUT22|So yeah, if you guys enjoyed this quick and short update, please do not forget to leave a like subscribe and let me know in the comments below.
NEUT23|What she has thoughts on AMC.
NEUT24|Whether you're still holding and having those diamond hands and hoping that we all go to the moon together and obviously send prayers for everyone, I continued to hold the stock.
BULL25|We are out here trying to beat these hedge funds and actually make those gains.
