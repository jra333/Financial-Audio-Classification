NEUT3|There's danger like a few smell sense.
NEUT4|The danger there should be a double.
BEAR5|Bearish divergance higher high on the price, lower high on the maybe lower high on the RSI if we still pop higher.
BEAR6|Ladies and gentlemen this will be a triple Berry style is this is not going to turn out well for FTT more likely than not FT should be popping lower.
NEUT7|This could be like a double top kind of ending and then we start a deep correction right?
NEUT8|Absolutely possible excuse me but then we're still very bullish above the snipping excuse me.
NEUT9|So which means that are potentially.
BULL10|Things should continue higher 4FT Bovary, overbought, double Berry diversions.
BULL11|We could still popular.
BEAR12|The danger is there but we remain bias bullish and so things are very uncertain at this point of time.
NEUT13|For FTT, I don't think there is a trick for FTT not at this point of time so not invited you and I can do except to be patient and to wait for the FT wheels to give us a sign shows the way but he feel like things could be popping lower anytime so be careful.
