BEAR0|"""Erin Kennedy here today is Taylor Muckerman are stuck the days Kinder Morgan Energy Partners stock is taken it on the chin this morning after over the weekend Barons released a somewhat bearish report."
NEUT1|Weather report say basically just rehashing a report from last September.
BEAR2|They called into question its relationship with Kinder Morgan, the general partner and incentive distribution rights that they're charging.
BEAR3|Also some of the maintenance cap ex citing that they are inflating their distributable cash flow.
NEUT4|So it's basically just reiterating and report.
NEUT5|From several months ago, so I didn't see much new here.
BEAR6|I don't know why the stock is tanking.
NEUT7|Maybe it's just bringing things back to light that the company has already come out publicly and kind of addressed.
NEUT8|Do you agree with Barons argument or do you see holes in it?
NEUT9|I definitely don't agree with the entire thing you look at this company and we're getting a lot of help from Kinder Morgan.
NEUT10|They're not just paying them the distributions when they talk about acquisitions, there's a lot of drop down assets and when they purchased Coca know last year, capital energy, Kinder Morgan didn't take the distribution, right?
BULL11|So it allowed them a little bit more flexibility.
NEUT12|So I like the oversight here.
NEUT13|I didn't really agree with barons.
NEUT14|Excuse me, their argument can work, is very well run company and its industry.
BEAR15|There's a lot of tailwinds and the largest company there so I can maybe see this as being opportunity well so the stock is widely underperformed.
NEUT16|The broader market in the past year.
NEUT17|Why do you think it's buying opportunity?
NEUT18|You like this talk?
NEUT19|I do.
NEUT20|I like the asset based a lot there spread out all across North America.
NEUT21|They have oil production.
NEUT22|They have CO2 production and there are huge natural gas transporter.
NEUT23|They have the assets down in the Gulf of Mexico on lock and then they also have some Canadian pipelines.
BULL24|That they're looking to build out even further so the asset base is Great North America is going to continue to be a natural gas producer, and after meeting with this company last September, spoke with Steve Cain, their CEO, and just had a lot of great things to say, and he even addressed some of this stuff.
NEUT25|Speaking with him before the report came out in September.
BEAR26|So I'm a believer in this company and down 4 or 5% today.
NEUT27|It might be a nice place to look.
NEUT28|"That's our stock today and we'll see you next time."""
