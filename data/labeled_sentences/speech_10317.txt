NEUT0|"""No doubt you've heard a lot about Tesla's price action on Monday."
BULL1|A $323.00 swing intraday.
NEUT2|Today Piper goes to 2322.
NEUT3|Jim Elon Musk on Twitter replied wow and the firm's point is that if solar and storage really does rival automotive one day in their words, investors will eventually need to pay attention.
NEUT4|Well look, there was a great discussion on squawk about with Bob.
NEUT5|Lots about how great Tesla really is.
NEUT6|The Piper piece is trying to find a justification, comes up on software.
NEUT7|And basically saying that this is a they're using that isn't a car, it's a technology vehicle that moves people around.
NEUT8|But I keep coming back to September 22nd.
NEUT9|I know Melissa was talking about the battery, that's battery day.
NEUT10|It maybe goes 1,000,000 miles.
NEUT11|I look, I think the issue is exactly what Honeywell told me, a Darius Adamczyk, the CEO.
NEUT12|You can build a possible battery that can last 8-9 hours.
NEUT13|That is a game changer because in 8-9 hour battery takes you very far across the country.
NEUT14|Or North South.
NEUT15|So if he has that then I think people say you know what I see, why people paid it wasn't just day traders, not does.
NEUT16|And he went with him.
NEUT17|I see why people pay these prices because that battery is then going to be able to be a gating issue to whether they can make 2,000,000 cars or three million cars will suddenly realize this is not a small company.
NEUT18|It's a giant company and they can't produce them fast enough and they have the best battery.
BULL19|And it's entirely possible that this might be the only car company that is able to come through this.
NEUT20|'cause we are all going easy.
NEUT21|We are and so I think it's the battery.
NEUT22|That's what we have to watch.
NEUT23|David, you battery believer?
NEUT24|Sure yes sure yeah why not?
BEAR25|I'm a battery believe she was in my car again.
NEUT26|Sure.
NEUT27|So you have to say what he would die hard.
NEUT28|We have already talked about like a major issue here.
NEUT29|I'm aware of the major issue I'm aware of it.
BULL30|Yes, even with oil prices where they are though Jim even with gasoline priced it fairly low levels.
NEUT31|You think they're still going to continue to be the rapid adoption I told you.
NEUT32|I said fossil fuels.
NEUT33|Or did you just won't listen to me?
NEUT34|I do listen to you and I'm well aware of that.
NEUT35|It's funny 'cause you know, we don't discuss CSG nearly as much as we.
NEUT36|Once did prior to the pandemic and how important it is, but I would assume that leads you to still say that fossil fuel stocks are off limits for you.
NEUT37|Only Chevron investable, less.
NEUT38|Only Chevron and Parsley PE $10 stock.
NEUT39|Yeah, so go go Robin Hood yourself.
NEUT40|And yes, Chevron for 6% yield Carl this group the $40 oil seems to be some sort of wall an I think those stocks have to be sold.
NEUT41|Interesting, yeah 40s.
BEAR42|Been sticky Jim.
NEUT43|I mean to your point about combustible engines.
BEAR44|I mean Ford Bronco Ford said there was a Stampede of reservations last night.
NEUT45|They had to bring the system down and apologize to people on Twitter if it only mattered if it only matters what they make the F-150 unbelievable kick the tires for another last weekend.
NEUT46|Here's the problem.
NEUT47|Balance sheet.
BEAR48|Balance sheet is terrible and they need cash.
NEUT49|They're not an airline.
NEUT50|And then when I listen to very, very serious Filipinos, this group so well.
NEUT51|I'm actually trying to figure out how many millions is Delta losing a day when it's something like, you know, high 20s, but Ford needs to has all these areas.
NEUT52|I thought that was going to do was just invest and then sell the products that people really want and not try to be forward to all people in all things all over the globe.
NEUT53|But they haven't put that strategy in place and you still find, well, you know what?
BEAR54|"It does matter with the 150 years of the Bronco, they're losing so much money in places you never even thought they were."""
