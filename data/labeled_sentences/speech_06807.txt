BEAR0|"""Tesla trades at a huge premium to the rest of the automotive industry and now its growth rate when you look at third quarter analyst estimates revenue is actually expected to fall year over year."
BEAR1|We have a declining top line in a tough business and the story is getting worse and worse and the balance sheet continues to be very rickety.
BEAR2|I see big trouble ahead.
BEAR3|What do you think is the main reason why the stock is down so much today?
BEAR4|I think that record deliveries did not produce profit.
NEUT5|It's really that simple.
NEUT6|Tesla reported 95,000 cars delivered in the second quarter.
NEUT7|Take that.
NEUT8|Tesla bears well, guess what?
BEAR9|Revenue was 10% below the record set in the third quarter last year when they delivered way fewer cars.
BEAR10|That is a textbook sign of a demand problem.
NEUT11|Tesla is cutting prices to move metal, and that's great that you could do that for a little while.
NEUT12|Not a sustainable business tactic, not a reason for a premium equity value.
NEUT13|Charlie, we talked to Tim Higgins your colleague yesterday about his reporting on some of the substitution that's been happen.
NEUT14|In where the Model 3 pricing?
NEUT15|You know it's the newer car in a way it was about the same price as the Model S, and maybe there was some cannibalization there is that reflected in these results?
NEUT16|Or do you think that some of those margin pressures are coming from the fact that Tesla is trying to differentiate that product?
BEAR17|Say it is the lower end product, you know from the model S&X fewer SNX sales are absolutely a huge problem.
BEAR18|Elon Musk said on the conference call last night that it's insignificant in terms of total delivery volume.
NEUT19|And yeah I guess that's true but it's.
NEUT20|Completely irrelevant, that's how Tesla has made what little money they have over there now.
NEUT21|Long history.
NEUT22|It's really not a startup.
NEUT23|It's been 15 years.
BULL24|They've made money in four discrete quarters.
BEAR25|"And you know, it's been here and there and it's been on the back of the S and the X, so you can dismiss that going away all you want, the margin pressure and mix issues that hamper Tesla are only going to get worse."""
