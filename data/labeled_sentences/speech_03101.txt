BEAR7|Fastly stock is down today in the mid day of this writing because fastly just released its fourth quarter financials yesterday after the market closed.
NEUT8|This is what fast Lee said themselves.
BULL9|Strong enterprise customer growth and continued execution of land and expand strategy.

NEUT22|What does this mean?
BULL23|AI Robot thinks that the company's losses wider even though its revenue has increased more than 40%.
BEAR24|In addition, the customer is remains about the same.
NEUT25|It only gains about a total of 37 new customers in last quarter.
BEAR26|Which is understandable because of the pandemic.
BEAR27|Most companies still don't want to spend more money on upgrades.
NEUT28|This is what I think about the stock price.
BEAR29|The short pressure is at three month low of $81.00.
BEAR30|If it is going down more in the next couple of days it will test the six month support which is set at $52 which was set back in November last year.
BULL31|AI Robot thinks that fastly is still a good and healthy company.
NEUT32|The stock project does not change yet at this time.
NEUT33|Please go to the stock review updates section for the newest stock report updates.
NEUT34|I believe that I had revised the stock price a couple of weeks ago because the stock price surpassed my yearly project.
NEUT35|"So I am just keep everything the same at this time because we have a long way to go."""
