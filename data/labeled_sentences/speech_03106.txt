NEUT5|It's a great opportunity and we'd love to have you join us, so let's take a look at this Facebook chart here.
NEUT6|Couple things that I'm seeing.
NEUT7|We've got this channel that Facebook has been in.
NEUT8|For since late 2000?
BEAR9|Oh sorry.
NEUT10|No since early 2016.
NEUT11|OK, so for about two months now it's been in this channel right here, OK?
NEUT12|And we closed right at it for two days in a row.
BULL13|Two days in a row.
NEUT14|This was Monday's session.
NEUT15|We closed right at it and then Tuesday's session to this resistance up here.
NEUT16|This is a big level for me, about 107, fifty about 108, and we've also got the beginnings of what could be a downtrend line.
NEUT17|We've only got 1.
NEUT18|Really just two touches, one touch here, one touch here so I'm just kind of drawing it.
NEUT19|Really like to see three separate touches in order for a trendline to really be.
NEUT20|You know, really meaningful, but I'm drawing it just in case because I do, you know we are coming up to it with this channel line.
NEUT21|So I do like to draw it just in case it ends up being valid.
BULL22|I like the angle of it and I do think it could potentially work out OK, so bulls want a break above this downtrend line and a break over 108.
NEUT23|Bears wanted to break out of this.
NEUT24|Channel right here on a closing basis.
NEUT25|Next support I'm seeing is 102.
NEUT26|Fifty next support I'm seeing after that is in about the 9596 range.
NEUT27|As you can see from this large volume by price Bar, which means that's where the most volume has traded for Facebook.
BULL28|OK, thanks for watching guys.
