NEUT11|I'm sure you don't, neither do I is free, but do you know this company makes a lot of money?
NEUT12|Yes, Facebook, one of the largest social media platform in the world, is founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 20 oh four, not just Facebook.
NEUT13|Facebook also owns Instagram and WhatsApp.

NEUT15|Basically they just just advertising see on businesses who advertise on their platform.
NEUT16|Which are the ads that you and I see where we browsing through our Facebook and Instagram feeds, right?
NEUT17|As revenue takes about 90% of Facebook revenue right?
NEUT18|One of the reasons why Facebook is so strong and profitable is because.
NEUT19|He has a very strong network effect.
NEUT20|Economy mode is social media and messaging platforms have a huge network of users that allow Facebook to monetize for the last nine years, Facebook has a very good track records on their finances.
BULL21|The revenue has grown and multiplied many times in this years.

NEUT28|Do you write if you had brought 100 shares of Facebook when the IPO in 2012 and average price about $40, that's about $4000 or investment.
BULL29|And if we hold 100 shares and do nothing till today in 2019, Facebook shares went up from 40 dollars 290, that means you're $4000 investment had grown to 19,000, just about 15,000 profit or about 4.7 times on your investments, right?
