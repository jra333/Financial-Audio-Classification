BULL0|"""Asynchronous different regions of the world are recovering from the pandemic of 2020 at different speeds, largely due to how well they contain the spread of the virus."
NEUT1|In 2020.
NEUT2|In 2021, the narrative will transition to how well countries managed the vaccination process.
BULL3|China was one of the very few large countries to record positive year over year economic growth in 2020.
BULL4|Unlike Europe and North America, China made solid progress in the second quarter of 2020 in containing the virus and that allow for a very robust economic recovery.
NEUT5|In the second half of 2020.
NEUT6|Interestingly, the wave of the virus is spread over North America and Europe in the second half of 2020.
BEAR7|Had the consequences of stimulating Chinese exports consumers that had kept their jobs were still spending money in North America and Europe, spending shifted away from services such as restaurants, hotels, airlines, etc and the available discretionary income was spent on goods especially.
NEUT8|For home improvement.
BULL9|The shift to more spending on goods benefited Chinese exports because they have a large goods manufacturing base.
BULL10|This goods versus services pattern will reverse as North America and Europe makes progress on vaccine distribution and accelerate the full reopening of their economies in the second half of 2021.
BULL11|The pent up demand for dining out travel may make for an especially robust economic recovery in the second half of 2021 for North America and Europe.
BULL12|This means that for 2021 the US may get a nice boost in real GDP relative to 2020, accompanied by a healthy job market gain as the economy more fully reopened.
BULL13|The same thing may occur up in Europe as well, but just more modestly given the challenges they have faced in the early stages of vaccine distribution.
NEUT14|South American growth patterns are less clear.
BEAR15|Baccin progress has been slow.
BEAR16|And there is a strong La Nina adding to drought worries in Brazil and Argentina.
NEUT17|For 2021, economic growth rates around the world or anything but synchronized.
NEUT18|The buzzword is asynchronous.
