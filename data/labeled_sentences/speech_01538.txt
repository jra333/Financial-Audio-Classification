NEUT0|"""Yeah, so up until today we had three rate hikes next year, but we kind of really thought that we looked at our CPI and forecasts and because of the price of oil we brought that down and it just seems like you know the Fed is at a point right now where it can really kind of feel its way along."
NEUT1|It doesn't have to be on this preset path of hiking rates and so you will think you will see slower rate hikes next year and we think by the middle of next year they will pretty much be done at that point.
NEUT2|So just to be clear, you're thinking only two though for 2019 for 2019, right?
NEUT3|I think the you know the one next week is pretty much a done deal at this point, and then it's you know we're looking for two.
NEUT4|What's the chance?
NEUT5|It's less.
NEUT6|Well, I think you know it depends on it really is going to depend on the growth outlook.
BULL7|Here you know if growth comes in as we expect and so for overall 2019 we're still looking like a 2 1/2% in real terms.
BEAR8|But if it actually slows down more than that, I mean you could potentially see you know one and you know potentially 0 but I think it really is going to end on one or zero a bullish sign.
NEUT9|Or is one or 00A bearish sign?
NEUT10|Because if they're not raising it means that they have the same anxieties and worries that.
NEUT11|The rest of the economy and market does.
BEAR12|Yeah, I would say one or zero is probably as a barrier sign is showing that the economy is slowing more than what people had expected, and that's obviously going to weigh on growth and corporate profits up.
NEUT13|If it's, if it's that sort of slow.
NEUT14|So for equity owners and investors, your expectation in terms of where the S&P and Dow will end 2019.
NEUT15|Well, so we don't.
BEAR16|We ourselves don't have a forecast that we do believe that profit growth is going to slow.
NEUT17|So I mean if you look at it before tax.
BULL18|Profits and this would be all economic profits in the entire economy is going to grow about 8% this year, and we're looking for about 5% growth next year.
NEUT19|Now whether or not that's factored into the market or not, I'm not going to opine on that.
BEAR20|'cause I'm not a stock market strategist, but we are certainly looking for slower growth in profits in 2019 and then set about flat growth in profits in 2020.
NEUT21|Is there any particular area or sector you think actually will outperform in a meaningful way?
BEAR22|Well, I think you know the capital spending has the potential to outperform as we go forward.
BULL23|One of the things that we haven't seen at this point is a real acceleration in capital spending.
NEUT24|Because the tax reform that potentially could happen as you go forward.
BEAR25|And when you look at consumer spending that was supercharged earlier this year, be cause in fact of the tax cuts, and that's probably going to slow as well.
NEUT26|So if there's something that's going to really outperformance go forward, I think it would probably be in the capital spending.
NEUT27|So if there's one area that you're particularly nervous about, there's one area and particularly nervous about it.
NEUT28|And nervous is a strong word, so I don't know if I would necessarily use that word but one.
BEAR29|Area of what will be watching is so the labor market as we all know is really tight right now.
NEUT30|And So what happens if wages really start to accelerate as we go through 2019?
NEUT31|And that really starts to put some upward pressure on prices instead of talking only two rate hikes next year?
NEUT32|I mean, just talk about what happens if they actually start to go for because inflation really starts to pick up.
NEUT33|So I think when I look at the economy right now, if I'm looking at a balance when access, if you will in the economy, I think it's the tightness of the labor market.
NEUT34|"Potentially what that could mean for Wade's acceleration going forward."""
