NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol CIDM."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT8|We play one make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
BULL9|Could say up here above $1.43.
NEUT10|Now.
NEUT11|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below Dollar 43.
BULL12|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage the above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving so it's time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yeah, staying above that level would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line.
NEUT21|The ball is 100% owned.
NEUT22|The chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|First level just simply where the party stopped several times today and that was up there, give or take right around that dollars 58 mark.
NEUT24|So keep a close eye on that and then let me squeeze down the chart here.
NEUT25|'cause as we're seeing it's been quite awhile since the price went down this low, but after that Dollar 58 ish area next key level up there going to be.
NEUT26|Right around that dollars 70 marks will keep running.
NEUT27|Those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT28|But on all any angle you look at it, great movement today, great volume and not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum.
NEUT29|Moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT32|But it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL34|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
NEUT40|Sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
