NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very nice day on this one.
NEUT5|Very impressive moving to the upside and it wasn't one of those situations where the price gapped up and then the price just crashed back down.
NEUT6|The gains were maintained so more of the story.
NEUT7|A lot of eyeballs will be watching Apple here moving forward, so let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT8|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
BULL9|We say Clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be if the price could say up here above 113.
NEUT10|Fifty.
BEAR11|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that level, that does not mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL12|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT14|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT17|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT18|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT19|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control over most.
NEUT20|Visualize that that is what has been represented.
NEUT21|Again.
BULL22|Yes and above that level would be great.
NEUT23|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bull is 100% owned.
NEUT24|The chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT25|First key battleground is going to be the pink line right there.
NEUT26|It's on my chart, denotes the very well known, very famous 200.
NEUT27|Moving average, and this is exactly why it's very famous, very well known.
NEUT28|Check it out and how the prices just struggled right up around that area.
NEUT29|But if the price can push up through that level for the next key area of resistance would then be right up there at the 117 mark.
BULL30|But All in all, very nice movement today, not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward?
NEUT31|Let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
