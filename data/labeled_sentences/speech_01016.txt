NEUT8|It's complicated, it could be I'm trying to do that with make a wish, we just keep sending money waiting down to its core elements.
NEUT9|The other thing about Warren Buffett is loyalty.
NEUT10|He was loyal to a fault because we earned it, but he was loyal and he knew why he liked the bank.
NEUT11|He did his homework, he interviewed me for things not like financial powers, but character and ethics and long term commitments.
NEUT12|And a guy like Warren Buffett embodies everything that make a wish.
NEUT13|Does giving back and doing it for a lifetime with intent.
NEUT14|And so I learned a lot of things from him, but both in the for profit world I can translate all those to the nonprofit world, because loyalty matters, and so does long term views of things, because you do smarter decisions when you think about the Longview.
