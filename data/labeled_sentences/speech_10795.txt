BULL0|"""And here we've got another bid or I should say yet another higher deal to acquire, as Jim just told you, coherent momentum, once again coming back to compete with two six."
NEUT1|Remember, they had also been MKS.
NEUT2|They've been in there, but it was a 3 way bidding war for awhile now we're 275, or roughly.
NEUT3|You can take a look at where we are.
NEUT4|It's 220 in cash and .61 shares.
NEUT5|I mean, this thing started out with a lot more stock than cash.
NEUT6|It was 100 I think in cash.
NEUT7|Originally it was worth somewhere in the low two hundreds.
NEUT8|At least based on that first day where Lumentum stock price opened up, you do have to wonder sometimes what aboard was thinking when there was that much more money on the table, potentially in that many more bidders.
NEUT9|That said, I'll cut him some slack because sometimes it does take actually signing a deal to get everybody's attention.
NEUT10|We saw it with CoreLogic too, but in this one, wow, it just keeps going on.
NEUT11|They've taken a billion dollars now at Lumentum from Silver Lake in a preferred.
NEUT12|That's got a conversion price in 9242.
NEUT13|So a bit from here, but they've taken in a billion dollars an then Bane actually contributed as much as $2 billion to 26 to help finance its deal and or perhaps it's next offer if they keep going here.
NEUT14|So this has been an interesting one to watch with coherence.
BULL15|Stock price continued to move up, although it is a significant spread, it's going to be in any trust view, no matter what Jim but photonics.
NEUT16|Which one of these is Occidental?
NEUT17|Which one of these is Chevron?
NEUT18|I don't know.
BEAR19|Now we're taking on too much debt too much.
NEUT20|Well, I will say Lumentum's current market cap is roughly equal to what they want to pay for coherent at this.
NEUT21|Well, they do.
NEUT22|Six is a bit above it there.
NEUT23|None of them are giant companies, but it's reminding me a little bit.
NEUT24|Remember 3 parts remember those days?
NEUT25|Remember Dell and HP going back and forth.
NEUT26|Three part that was a great one, but here you've got.
NEUT27|We'll see what 26 does, but again, you do sometimes wonder.
NEUT28|To the board not do enough early on?
NEUT29|Could they not get everybody's attention until they actually signed a deal?
NEUT30|Who knows?
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
