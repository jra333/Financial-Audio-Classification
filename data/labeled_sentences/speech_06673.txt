NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for February 26, 2016."
NEUT1|I'm seeing a necklace technical analyst at except.com.
NEUT2|Today we will look at the dollar versus yen on the daily chart.
BULL3|USD JPY is testing the 113 yen levels today.
BEAR4|There was an attempt to break above it briefly this morning, but the Paris mostly traded below this 113 level all week now.
BEAR5|However, prices appear to have bottomed out and steadied since dropping to 16 month lows of 110.96, and this was on February 11th.
BULL6|So since then we have a bit of stabilization.
BEAR7|Also, the leveling off of the RSI.
BEAR8|Around oversold levels at 30 suggests that downward pressure in prices has eased for now in the market will likely consolidate in the short term.
BEAR9|But the overall outlook remains bearish based on some of the technical indicators, we can see the moving averages there negatively aligned.
NEUT10|We have the shorter term 50 day moving average below the other two below the 100 and 200 day moving averages.
BEAR11|Meanwhile, Mcdee is also below 0 and this supports bearish bias as well.
BULL12|So the 112 yen level is a key support level for now, which if broken, we'll see a resumption of the downtrend that started on January 29th when prices fell from 121.68.
BULL13|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
