NEUT0|"""Hi everybody, it's David Keno with Basecamp trading."
NEUT1|So I'm looking at Amazon today.
NEUT2|Now I've been holding several big fish webinars focused on stocks.
NEUT3|Can make big substantial.
NEUT4|Moves in the market.
BEAR5|An one I've been kind of pounding the table on in the past couple of sessions has been Amazon now.
NEUT6|The first time I mentioned Amazon, I said you could get into Amazon with a break of a previous days.
BEAR7|Hi, this is the high from Friday so you could have entered that trade up on the break of the high at 1383.
NEUT8|OK, the crazy thing is today we are above 1440.
NEUT9|So what you're looking at is a $57 move right now in Amazon.
NEUT10|Now there's still some capacity in this move.
NEUT11|We're looking for a move back up to 1461 and eventually 1500.
BEAR12|Now again, the markets are pushing this to the upside today, but you can even see days that we've pulled back.
NEUT13|Like yesterday.
BULL14|Amazon still has a fairly bullish day, so again, I would continue to ride this.
NEUT15|I take some profits at 1460.
NEUT16|But let a portion of your winner run all the way to 1500, again $20 + 40 dollars is a nice additional $60.00 move.
NEUT17|Now, if you took the trade from the break of 1383, congratulations, right now you have a $57 move with an additional.
NEUT18|$60.00 more that you can take and that, my friends, is a potential $7000 trade per contract.
NEUT19|So Congrats, if you're in the big fish trade, if you want to learn more about this methodology and how you can leverage positions into 100% gains thousands per contract and do it in the course of three to four days, two to four days, take part in our upcoming Big Fish trading workshop.
NEUT20|Coming about here on February 27th.
BULL21|"Thank you."""
