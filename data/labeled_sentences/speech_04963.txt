NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Carl Palmer, Filipino American living here in New York City on the resident caretaker of New York Buddhist Church, and I also run a food business on the side."
NEUT1|The coolest thing about running this business is that I get to cook in front of customers and I can't do that right now with because of covid.
NEUT2|So you going from 60 to 80 events a year at this peak at this complete high.
BEAR3|From that to nothing nothing it got worse and worse.
BEAR4|My wife was stuck in China and my parents were stuck in the Philippines when Covid hit your watching everybody dying.
NEUT5|You know on these ventilators.
NEUT6|I hear the sirens.
NEUT7|I start hearing the gunshots, the protesting when you start hearing the rhetoric, this kung flu virus, this China virus.
NEUT8|I knew that we were going to targeted.
NEUT9|Maybe it started in China but you can't blame your fellow American for something that happened overseas.
NEUT10|It wasn't making any money.
NEUT11|More is about checking up on the people that I knew we didn't have a good health and see how I could help them.
NEUT12|We started getting these free Bento boxes project Bento so I'm delivering to the retirement community.
NEUT13|You know, these old folks are by themselves.
BEAR14|They're so isolated.
NEUT15|I hope they could see the smile.
NEUT16|You know behind my mask.
NEUT17|All this anti Asian crime started happening.
BEAR18|One of my associates got robbed and then my staff member got spit on.
BEAR19|The news is getting worse.
NEUT20|I was thinking about the safety of the church.
NEUT21|People come and visit us from different congregations from different temples.
NEUT22|And then I wanted to make sure that those guys were safe.
NEUT23|So I called up this company to order some stuff.
NEUT24|This little unit flashlight and it has a pepper spray here and it has a Taser as well.
NEUT25|I pray I pray I never have to use this damn thing.
NEUT26|Now I'm delivering self defense weapons too.
NEUT27|Those who don't feel safe if we get cut, we bleed bread the same color, and if only these people attacking our elders in our community realize that there's a little bit of you in that person and you.
BEAR28|Creating that harm to that person, you're in reality, you're hurting yourself.
BEAR29|You are hurting yourself.
NEUT30|Carl says he hopes to promote Asian culture and healing by handing out those free Bento boxes showcasing Asian food.
BULL31|"Wherever there's been a crime in New York City, and he hopes to expand those Bento boxes to include other cultures as well."""
