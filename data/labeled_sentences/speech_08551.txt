BULL3|What an exciting day we are having.
BULL4|I hope everybody is doing great.
NEUT5|Just remember I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT6|This is not financial advice.
NEUT7|Let's get right into it now.
NEUT8|Today we have had an unbelievable morning Elon Musk just to do a quick recap.
NEUT9|He tweeted out about doge coin.
BULL10|We had an incredible spike all the way up to 7 cents.
BEAR11|You know about a week or two ago we were in that ascending triangle broke to the downside.
BEAR12|Real real real bad when all the way down to 4.9 cents, right down here.
NEUT13|By the way, this is the Webel platform.
BULL14|Awesome awesome trading platform right now.
NEUT15|Get two free stocks valued up to $1600 when you sign up and deposit $100 link in the description below.
NEUT16|This is what I'm hoping.
BULL17|I hope we stabilize in the six cent area and then we consolidate for a period of time and then have our next move up.
NEUT18|So let's take a look at this article.
NEUT19|Very very interesting article here.
NEUT20|Your Doge coin investment could pay for a snazzy Jersey so this article talks about a few different things and I'm not going to go through every word in it, but I will go through the important parts now this person is has a really, really good point at the beginning of this article and they go on to say, I advocate for creating an exchange traded fund that holds all major an not so major cryptocurrencies.
NEUT21|That way conservative types such as myself who never consider buying doge coin or any other cryptocurrency.
NEUT22|For that matter, could do so with less trepidation, and I totally agree with this, but they do go on to say that so far there's a lot of pending applications in the US, and there's a couple options in Canada, but that's really it, and most of them are all zeroed in on Bitcoin and not so much as a collective of cryptocurrencies.
BULL23|And I totally agree with them.
NEUT24|That will open it up to more people investing in crypto's you know altogether, so that will be very, very interesting.
NEUT25|This person is basically saying that the only crypto currencies that are going to be around 5 to 10 years from now are the ones with utility.
NEUT26|Those are the ones that people, companies places are going to accept as payment.
NEUT27|So just like we have, you know, the Dallas Mavericks accepting Doge coin as a pavement.
NEUT28|'cause of Mark Cuban setting all that up.
NEUT29|So stuff like that.
NEUT30|That is utility.
BULL31|It adds utility to doge coin, so this is a really, really good article.
NEUT32|I will link this down in the description so you guys could take a look at it.
BULL33|"As always, I appreciate everybody watching an I will see you in the next one."""
