NEUT0|"""A lot of chit chat over the weekend on the future of Robin Hood."
NEUT1|Doug Kass of Seabreeze, among many others, talking about how Robin Hood would consolidate into stronger hands, is that just a given?
NEUT2|I don't know bout consult, I think it has aims to be an independent kind of owned company and I think it's going down the path of an IPO at some point.
NEUT3|I don't think it's going to be part of someone else is kind of wider portfolio as much as it can help it.
BULL4|It certainly had a cash squeeze because of everything that happened last week, but I think you know it was able to raise the money in pretty short order.
NEUT5|Tell me the thinking of the people that gave them a reported, I believe, just under $1 billion.
NEUT6|They pony up.
NEUT7|Is it to protect their interest?
NEUT8|Is it to take a greater equity interest where it's opportunistic for them?
NEUT9|What's that emotion?
NEUT10|I mean, it was their financial backers to begin with.
NEUT11|Sequoia Capital is one of am.
NEUT12|I think these are these are funders who want to see it become have.
BULL13|Robin had become a large valuable entity in and of itself.
BEAR14|It had a cash squeeze just because of, you know, exchange listing rules where you have to put up collateral and so it needed the money in very short order.
NEUT15|The fact that it was able to do that, you know, literally within 24 hours is a sign that people have a lot of faith that this can become its own big company.
NEUT16|Who's saying what will Robin Hood become in three years?
NEUT17|I think it wants to be the the the kind of big brokerage for for the millennial population, so I think it you know it has its eyes on being the next generation Fidelity for the up and coming investors.
NEUT18|I mean, are there any mistakes this week that that could actually give way to another platform?
NEUT19|Or do they have first mover advantage that would just won't go away?
BEAR20|No, I think that first mover advantage, but you know the disappointing thing about Robin had over the last week is their their communication strategy was, I think, very lackluster when everything was happening.
NEUT21|They didn't really control the narrative in a single bit.
BEAR22|There were lots of these accusations as to what was actually going on.
NEUT23|There was a thread on Reddit, you know, saying that you know there are people kind of behind the scenes and manipulating Robin Hood, and they're kind of going against, you know, going against everything you know.
BEAR24|I think the CEO did a pretty bad job in terms of owning the message as an independent leader, but.
NEUT25|You know most of this stuff was, quite frankly out of Robin Hood's hands because, you know, people are buying.
NEUT26|People are buying long dated kind of call options on things and you know they had to.
NEUT27|They had to go off and feel kind of collateral requirements.
NEUT28|Well, let's pick up on these delicate statements that you make the observation that the gentleman from the hood did a pretty bad job of messaging are his principles.
NEUT29|Setting Robin Hood up for a management change to go IPO or are they setting it up for a management change?
NEUT30|To find the greatest bidder to be the millennials broker.
BULL31|It's a, it's a good.
NEUT32|It's a good question.
NEUT33|I don't think there's going that.
NEUT34|You implied in the question is is there going to be a management change?
NEUT35|I don't think there's going to be a management change, but I think you're seeing once again the image auriti of a young tech company and the leadership in the Young tech company kind of own, you know, be able to take responsibility and be able to own its own narrative.
NEUT36|You see this time and time again with Facebook is kind of the poster child and you know.
BULL37|Yet again, you're finding a company that's kind of thrust into the limelight.
NEUT38|That's more powerful than it ever probably intended to be.
BULL39|"And it's on the back foot you would imagine these companies, should be able to grow up a lot faster."""
