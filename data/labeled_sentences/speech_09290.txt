BULL0|"""This time full smart charts with Abigail Doolittle, where we look at the timely topics through the charts with the streets top technicians Abigail well Caroline, we are lucky enough to have policy Anna of Bank of America Merrill Lynch there."
BULL1|Fick technical strategist there could not be a better day considering that we briefly had that US 210 inversion earlier today and you know you really stand out because you've had great calls on race and a lot of our other guests and folks on the streets were talking about yields bouncing back higher, backing up something that possible to uni in the charts as well.
BEAR2|You were talking about a continued drop.
NEUT3|You've had that.
BEAR4|Yeah, look the bond market rally has been nothing but a Raging Bull market, right?
NEUT5|And we're still seeing that.
NEUT6|And today's inversion in the spread between two year Treasury yields on 10 year Treasury yield certainly exhibits what's been happening in the bond market.
BEAR7|So here we have a chart going back the last couple of years and just this morning that spread dip below 0.
NEUT8|Now this is a very important break because it confirms the Mac D signal that we received about two weeks ago.
NEUT9|My team at the right.
BEAR10|We got a signal where the white line crossed below the red line, suggesting that the time series would move lower.
BULL11|An indeed it has.
NEUT12|So now the question is.
NEUT13|One, what does an inversion of the twos 10s truly mean to the bond market in the global market and two, how much further can the curve truly inverts?
NEUT14|OK, so let's start with the second question first.
NEUT15|How much further do you want those per history?
BEAR16|So when we go back over the last 20 or so years, there are levels down here around 13 to 16 where the curve once bottomed out.
NEUT17|It was another base at about minus 20 and then way back it was around minus 50 to 56 so that until I believe so, yeah, so realistically we're only at 0, right?
NEUT18|There is potential that.
BEAR19|Two stands could invert as deep as 50 basis points.
NEUT20|Yeah, and I think that will be a function of how slow or not slow the Fed actually reacts to.
NEUT21|Some of the things going on.
NEUT22|OK, so now let's talk about why what it means for the bond market.
NEUT23|Also, do you think that if we are going to continue to invert like that, is it going to come more from the two year going higher?
BEAR24|The 10 year going lower and even mix?
NEUT25|I suspect it'll probably be from the 10 year.
BULL26|There's a lot more opportunity to make money.
NEUT27|Essentially in 10 year duration, so I think the markets chasing that and what does it really mean, right?
NEUT28|I think there's three key takeaways.
NEUT29|Today's in version one.
NEUT30|It says that the S&P 500 is likely on borrowed time.
NEUT31|What usually happens?
BEAR32|There's about a 5 to 10% correction.
NEUT33|There is sometimes a last get exactly.
NEUT34|I mean all the headlines.
NEUT35|They were not right, right?
NEUT36|There's then a potential last gasp for the Bulls, which sometimes even leads to a new high in the market.
NEUT37|That's questionable at this point, but there's that kind of rally and then the recession numbers kick in, so that would be.
NEUT38|Second takeaway.
NEUT39|Seven of the last seven.
NEUT40|Yes inversions, yes.
BULL41|Recessions follow OK. Good good statistic.
NEUT42|Let's very quickly in 60 seconds.
NEUT43|Now take a look at both your currency chart and golds or very quick dollar CNH.
BULL44|One month forward the famed pattern by I believe William O'Neill Cup and handle pattern broke out above resistance.
NEUT45|Above this trendline.
NEUT46|123 and actually that was before the China devalues breakout ikerd.
NEUT47|We had the rally up to around seven.
NEUT48|10715 we're having the dip by the dip.
NEUT49|We're going to 725 big rally.
BULL50|OK now turning to gold talk about another rally and you're right on point here with long long term chart of gold going back to the.
BULL51|1870s I think we're in five wave structure wave one wave, two wave, three Wave, 4 nice rounded base breakout above the five year highs.
NEUT52|I think this could go as high as $2300 an ounce.
BULL53|"You heard it first here new nominal high ahead for gold."""
