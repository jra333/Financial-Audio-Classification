NEUT0|"""Look at the portfolio you have over at Newton investment and you ever portfolio."
NEUT1|That's exposure of 11.3% to precious metals.
BEAR2|Do you see any precious metals being vulnerable to what we saw this week with Silver?
NEUT3|Well, I mean the the metal space, the commodity space it is, you know, undeniably unstable at times its pricing is unstable, but we hold it very much for a reason and precious metals exposure that we do have is actually to the physical gold through an ETC.
NEUT4|And the reason for that is that in the bigger picture, in terms of the macro backdrop within, there really is quite a big regime shift going on in financial markets and the economy.
NEUT5|And that is 1, which is much more driven by reflation.
NEUT6|Because obviously we've got a policy response which is both monetary and fiscal in the form of MMT, and posed to make us a pretty keen to run the economies on hotter with embracing a little bit more inflation.
BULL7|So real assets such as gold, I think, will continue to do well in this environment, and it was one of the best performing asset classes last year, but the sizing of any position in a security within the context of the token portfolio is very important.
BEAR8|We have scaled back our gold position.
NEUT9|Quite recently, but when you think about risk offsetting positions to return seeking assets, and we don't actually believe their bonds are going to do very much for you in this in this environment and gold.
BULL10|"Plus other diversifies are some effective hedges against volatility that we're seeing in markets."""
