NEUT0|"""Hello puppy trades."
NEUT1|This is my first video.
BEAR2|I got a bunch of requests on Apple today which is a little concerning because we just had a flat day.
BEAR3|So that means that a lot of you guys are trading with very short time horizons or you know what's even worse, you have no conviction behind your trades and that's a problem.
NEUT4|But I'm going to, you know, maybe get you guys some convict conviction right here.
NEUT5|So you guys what I am seeing what I'm looking for.
NEUT6|You know why I'm bullish Apple?
NEUT7|So the first thing that happens, Apple goes on a run right here.
NEUT8|And this is this is a five week run right?
NEUT9|So when I do my time target from this low.
NEUT10|It's five weeks because you go 5 weeks.
NEUT11|This was five weeks you go 5 weeks right here, right?
NEUT12|This is this, is this is equal legs.
NEUT13|This is some X symmetry.
NEUT14|You know, market symmetry right here.
NEUT15|So what's more than equal legs is that we go on this run and then it consolidates into ABC correction.
NEUT16|Now we know it's consolidation because during the pullback.
BEAR17|We have declining volume right?
BEAR18|So when we have declining volume, that is the signal for bullish consolidation.
NEUT19|So we go ABC and then once we have, you know this reaction off the low.
BEAR20|It looks like we have a major pivot low, a major pivot high.
NEUT21|I connect the high with the low for the Andrews Pitchfork and I use this little toggle right here to see where is price.
NEUT22|Best being contained by the Andrews Pitchfork right.
NEUT23|And so if I if I said it right here, you know, connect the high in the low.
NEUT24|We have one to look at that beautiful reaction right here.
NEUT25|3456789, Ten eleven you know.
NEUT26|Even right here I got so many questions like oh is Apple like you know still bullish today?
NEUT27|Like should I sell?
NEUT28|You know is is the world ending.
NEUT29|No like we're still on this Pitchfork medium like this is another great day.
NEUT30|You know if in less you're trading the.
NEUT31|You know the five minutes are?
NEUT32|You shouldn't be worried right now at all about Apple.
BULL33|In fact, you got a lot of confirmation that Apple is going to hire today because we continue to validate this pitsford.
NEUT34|This picture will continue to act as resistance.
NEUT35|So what happens when you have a valid Pitchfork with all these beautiful reactions?
NEUT36|You have statistically an 80% chance that without without any of this without any of the declining volume without any of the you know wave principles, just the fact that you have a valid Pitchfork.
NEUT37|You have an 80% chance that the median will be reached.
NEUT38|OK, this is going to act as a magnet.
NEUT39|This will also act as a resistance.
NEUT40|You know, level, right?
NEUT41|Like the same thing with draft Kings, right?
NEUT42|We, you know, connect the high with the low.
NEUT43|And then get gas where you know resistance is met.
NEUT44|Boom, you know.
NEUT45|So that's the same thing going on with Apple right now we've got about Pitsford were on the lower bound of it right now, and we're about to head to the medium.
NEUT46|So if you don't know, you know this meeting exists or you don't know where this Pitchfork is, I'm sure you are, you know, very worried, like, oh like is this.
NEUT47|You know what?
NEUT48|If it's you know what?
NEUT49|If it's a you know BC like should I sign up for a new subscription service?
NEUT50|Know like that's just ridiculous?
NEUT51|You know all these people saying this is 3 peaks in a Dome house?
NEUT52|You know, I can assure you they're not trading the market because if they were, they blow up their account by now.
NEUT53|They're trying to sell you stuff.
NEUT54|They're trying to say hey, like the markets about the crash.
BEAR55|No, we had a ABC correction.
BEAR56|We had declining volume and we have valid Pitchfork.
NEUT57|We're heading to the medium.
NEUT58|Which is 150.
NEUT59|In five weeks.
NEUT60|"So we've already been two or three weeks, so that means that by the end of October, you know, by 11/5 at the latest, we're still expecting 151 'cause this is equal legs placed at the low by about Halloween or November 5th."""
