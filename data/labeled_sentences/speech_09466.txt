NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol apre."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT2|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT3|In case maybe new charts instead of each one of these candle sticks here representing one days worth of price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT4|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT5|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT6|It's actually today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT7|I'll let you this time frame.
NEUT8|Thing is a good job of telling the quote, unquote story of the price, and in this situation makes mapping out a very logical question quite straightforward.
NEUT9|That question revolves around the fact that today the price made a really nice movement.
NEUT10|When you consider the price was.
NEUT11|Over the past couple of days and now you look at where the price is now I get it.
NEUT12|Yeah, the price did pull back, but still compared to where it was and then you look at where it is right now.
NEUT13|Any rational person.
NEUT14|So yeah, the price made a nice move today, but this does lead to the valid question of.
NEUT15|But is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT16|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT17|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT18|I have no idea, but like I said by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single level and a better illustrate this, I want to scrunch up a chart here just to give a little bit more context and.
NEUT19|Perspective, but the key level here that really stands out to me.
NEUT20|Is down here at let's see what is that .013 wise .13 so important.
NEUT21|Well hopefully we can agree on the logic that price movement with genuine strength with true power the price is going to progress for the price is not going to go back to where it was.
BULL22|I'm assuming you're saying thanks Captain obvious.
NEUT23|Of course if your price movement is truly powerful, it's not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT24|That would be a total contradiction exactly.
NEUT25|So.
NEUT26|With that in mind, think about .013.
NEUT27|Any sort of closes blow there or were set up.
NEUT28|The price separates of the downside.
NEUT29|What would that be doing with the price that would literally be put in the price?
BULL30|Right back inside of this big old range that it just broke out from again going back.
NEUT31|Not a sign of true power words.
NEUT32|Let's say the price pulls back here.
NEUT33|Behave in this manner and then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT34|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT35|Well, you'd have a set of Lowe's right here.
NEUT36|You would have this set of Lowe's down here if you picture each one of these as stair steps will.
NEUT37|Hey now you have stair steps progressing in the upward direction and again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT38|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
NEUT39|Overtime, it's going to make progress forward and in this situation I'm just defining and quantifying the phrase make progress as .013 as far as levels of resistance are concerned, I'm going to touch on those because in my opinion, top priority right now, especially with the pullback.
NEUT40|It's just making sure that the pullback stays healthy and doesn't spin out of control.
NEUT41|What do I mean by spinning out of control?
BEAR42|Well again going down below .13 and which would therefore classified is going back inside of that range.
NEUT43|I would define that as also spinning out of control.
NEUT44|So let's just make sure it goes through a healthy consolidation and once more healthy being staying up above .13.
NEUT45|So let's see if the Bulls can get that job done or not.
NEUT46|One of the biggest questions, I get is likely how do you find the stocks that you trade So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talked about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential so if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader then click on the image that is up on the screen.
NEUT47|Right now and I will email you.
NEUT48|The guide the guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT49|It's completely free.
NEUT50|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT51|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
