NEUT0|"""It's time now for Barones Buzz, where we take a sneak peek into the latest issue of Barron's Magazine, joining me now, as ever, is senior editor."
NEUT1|Jack how hijack happy Friday.
NEUT2|Thank you.
NEUT3|So what have you got for us today?
NEUT4|3D printing.
NEUT5|I love that cover stories on 3D printing.
NEUT6|This of course is the sort of layered manufacturing process where you can create 3 dimensional objects and it's all the rage right now in the technology world.
NEUT7|Number of stocks that are involved in this as pureplay companies investors are familiar with the names, 3D systems, Strata, Sys X1.
BULL8|Project and these shares are up anywhere from 150% to almost 400% over the past couple of years.
NEUT9|We take a hard look at this business.
NEUT10|These aren't the only players.
NEUT11|There are big big stalwarts like General Electric that are involved here and some other private companies.
NEUT12|We basically look at the the economics here who really stands to win.
NEUT13|Whether some of these shares are worth their valuations and some cheaper ways investors can get exposure to the space if they're looking for it.
NEUT14|I think readers will be surprised by some of the numbers on this, yes, but it does sound like some very.
NEUT15|Big gains next one passive aggressive investing who's guilty of that and what does it mean?
NEUT16|Well, we've seen these pass through investments, REITs Master Limited, partnerships, business development companies.
NEUT17|These are things where you know you have a business where they make profits.
NEUT18|They send almost all of it onto investors as dividends or distributions.
NEUT19|They become very popular for investors looking for yield.
NEUT20|The most popular ones right now are the ones with the steadiest cashflows.
NEUT21|Investors want that safety and income, however, that makes them the most expensive.
NEUT22|There are some out there that are much, much cheaper than the group that have a little bit more cyclical exposure.
NEUT23|We argue that that might be what you want right now.
NEUT24|In an economic recovery that seems to be pretty strong at the passive aggressive, but not so much passive aggressive, it's actually getting a way of getting to getting aggressive on passthrough invited.
NEUT25|Same negative meeting between paying maybe 20 or 25 times earnings and paying maybe six or seven times running, so it's a big difference in price.
NEUT26|Yeah, it sounds like I sent some to pay attention to, and of course happy birthday to the NASDAQ 40th 40th anniversary coming up.
NEUT27|14 for 14 starts talking about the the 5th anniversary of the lows for the S&P 500, but we're also passing the 14th anniversary of the highs for the NASDAQ.
NEUT28|Yeah, now we still need a bit of a push to get back to the high we need about 15 or 16% gain to get back to the 5000 level from here and the high was just over the 5000 level, but we basically take a fresh look at the NASDAQ now versus then.
NEUT29|We don't see the pets.com type of companies now, but there are certainly some haves and haves not have nots in a technology world.
NEUT30|Some some U.S. companies out there with pretty ambitious building here.
NEUT31|A lot of this comparison right now in terms of some of the buzz in the tech sector to that.
NEUT32|But it's still very different from what we saw.
NEUT33|Alright, very different in terms of the profits in terms of the balance sheets.
NEUT34|However, there is some evidence out there.
NEUT35|I mean, there's certainly some names you can point to and say wait a second valuations starting look pretty pretty frothy for something to Internet names and so forth.
BULL36|All right, Jack, thank you very much.
BULL37|Thank you as always.
NEUT38|So we have time for now.
BULL39|"Thanks for joining us."""
