NEUT0|"""If I had one question for you, what it would be and and and, that's just the notion that global growth seems to be more difficult to come by than we remember."
NEUT1|And in I mean you've had a long life.
NEUT2|I've had a long life and you know, we've heard it's different this time again, and again and again, and I'm starting to hear things like that that it's the demography and that people are, you know, there's not enough people being born and there's too many old people around the world that are going with not enough young people ready to take care of their retirement and.
BEAR3|I'm just wondering whether it's still a hangover from 2008.
NEUT4|Or whether there's something different about the entire world that that to get above 1 1/2 or 2% seems so difficult for us right now.
NEUT5|What do you tie it to?
NEUT6|Just a hangover from the financial crisis or more?
BULL7|Well, it it made me more good, easily be more, but it's certainly I think.
NEUT8|Still, ties to what happened in 2008 or 9 that that was a.
BEAR9|Financial earthquake felt around the world and.
NEUT10|I would say that the banks.
NEUT11|In Europe.
BEAR12|Uh were in worse shape than the American banks.
NEUT13|So it it was not, it was a.
NEUT14|Financial shock, which we hadn't experienced or the world hadn't experienced since the 1930s and the 1930s took a long time to come out of it.
NEUT15|So I I think that's partly the fact, but I would mention again that that.
NEUT16|A world of 2%.
NEUT17|Real per capita growth.
BULL18|Is a fantastic world in that in our own country.
NEUT19|In one generation you would add $19,000 of GDP per person.
NEUT20|That means a family of 476 thousand in one generation, 25 years from 2% physical growth, so you know it, it might not be what we had for awhile and we have 3% but 2% would do wonders for the world.
NEUT21|I mean you would have a.
BULL22|So much more prosperous world, 25 years from now.
BULL23|If we could have 2% growth throughout the world and in in real terms.
NEUT24|But I, I think if you ask me what it's the biggest factor is, I think it's I think it's the hangover from.
NEUT25|2008 and 2009 the world deleveraged in a very major way, and leveraging up those wonderful things.
NEUT26|And while it's going on and leveraging down is not as much fun.
