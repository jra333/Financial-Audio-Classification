NEUT0|"""OK look, take a look at this daily chart of the Dow Jones industrial average to market."
NEUT1|His team take a proactive approach to time in the market rather than a reactive one which doesn't do us any good at all.
BEAR2|And later August you can see he warned us that the market would could soon peak and we did have a short term peak followed by a big breakdown, but it didn't stick.
NEUT3|Why not?
NEUT4|Here's the thing many years ago to mark him up to Mark came up with a series of timing models that couldn't be ridiculously reliable.
NEUT5|He's always looking for moments.
NEUT6|True, just moments.
NEUT7|Snapshots where trend is about to exhaust itself.
NEUT8|You get more detail on this method at something called symbolic, spell FUSY MB olik.com his cloud based analytics platform.
NEUT9|These models allowed to market his team to spot key price levels in key moments where a stock or an index or even a cryptocurrency is likely to change its trajectory when the Dow peaked in September 2nd.
NEUT10|You can see where we are.
NEUT11|It coincided perfectly with the marks timing model, but not his priced model.
NEUT12|He figured we run all the way to 29,400 or even 29,500 before repeat.
BEAR13|In other words, even though he pretty much colder so off his methodology suggested there was something off about the decline when the Dow bottomed on September 24th.
BULL14|To Mark Short term timing indicator turned positive.
BULL15|Which convinced him that his old upside targets were back in play.
BEAR16|He sees the Dow running to anywhere from 24409 to 29, five, five, one before it runs out of steam up about 2 1/2 to 3% from which currently trading.
NEUT17|So we want to grab that gate right?
NEUT18|We want to grab.
NEUT19|We don't want to.
NEUT20|We don't want to be greedy.
NEUT21|So in terms of timing, the Dallas Now 10 sessions into what could be another 13 session sequential pattern.
NEUT22|That's the same pattern that told the mark.
NEUT23|The market would roll over in early September if we get three more sessions, right?
NEUT24|Where the Dow finishes above the clothes from two days before above the closed for two days before then, the pattern says we're looking at a top.
NEUT25|So let's take a look at what could happen here.
NEUT26|Damarques another timing model.
NEUT27|It puts us, puts us 11 sessions into a 13 session countdown, meaning two more up days.
NEUT28|Take us to the peak.
NEUT29|If the Dow also hits the Mark's price target in that.
BEAR30|Well, then things could get ugly, assumes pattern holds up.
BULL31|He thinks we've got one last leg higher.
NEUT32|OK, so you have to get out today, but you have one last leg higher before this rally runs out of Steam.
NEUT33|It's possibly the nu E. That's not what I want to hear, but it would make sense.
NEUT34|We've had a monster run going into earnings season, so let's say this pattern unfolds, is predicted to get one last hurrah through the end of the week.
NEUT35|We learned about three more big weeks of earnings after this.
NEUT36|Then the market rolls over.
NEUT37|What happens next?
NEUT38|Well, then, of course we have to contend with the election, assuming the Dow Peaks in a few days, and then we get that sharp decline, and he's talking about the Marxist, there should be just enough time for his indicators to turn positive and identify a bottom right before the election.
