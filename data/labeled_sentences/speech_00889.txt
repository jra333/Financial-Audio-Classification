NEUT27|If you really want to learn from this video guys pay very close attention to what Mac just said.
NEUT28|It was a swing trade.
NEUT29|How long did he stay in the trade?
NEUT30|It was three days.
NEUT31|Let me ask you a simple question.
NEUT32|How long did you stay in your last trade for most of average traders, your answer is going to be like 3 ******* minutes because the moment the ship went against you, you got out.
NEUT33|Guys it takes.
NEUT34|Patience it takes understanding of your calculations and the moves to stay in the trade for three damn days, three days and look it's not.
BEAR35|It looks on this chart like a straight shot down, but you know that's not the case.
NEUT36|Look at all these tails sticking out so at some point the stock was bouncing, dropping, bouncing, dropping and so it takes psychological toughness and understanding the calculations to actually stay through the balance is not get out, wait for third drop.
NEUT37|Understand that bounces or just counter clockwise movements in the overall movement lower.
NEUT38|So if maybe you got into this trade but you're like, oh, forget it, I'm happy with making $500.
