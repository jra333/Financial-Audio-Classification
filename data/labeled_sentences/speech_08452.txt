NEUT0|"""Yahoo and Alibaba ended their rather acrimonious, not totally ended, but kind of ended this acrimonious back and forth they've had over several years Yahoo with a nice chunk of change, but what are they going to do with it?"
NEUT1|Share Tipton is here with the details on this one, so tell us what actually happened this morning, yeah, so yeah yeah Yahoo and Alibaba finally reached a deal.
NEUT2|You know, I think they've been working on this for years.
NEUT3|Basically trying to figure out what to do with the stake.
BULL4|Alibaba's been pretty vocal about wanting.
NEUT5|Chinese Internet, yeah exactly.
BULL6|It's going very well.
NEUT7|Yeah yeah yeah.
NEUT8|Lot of Yahoo's value.
NEUT9|You know people believe is the Alibaba stake and then their stake in Yahoo Japan.
NEUT10|So they finally agreed to kind of come up.
NEUT11|Come up with the structure for Alibaba to buy out Yahoo.
NEUT12|And initially they'll be buying half of Yahoo's 40% stake which in itself is a $7 billion deal.
NEUT13|Yeah, at least $7 billion.
NEUT14|You know they were.
NEUT15|They had a conference call, then get a bigger pop from the $7 billion.
NEUT16|Yeah, I mean they were up.
NEUT17|You know quite a bit pre market and then when they open they open down actually so it was.
NEUT18|Yeah this stock isn't doing too much right now but but you know that's based on the seven point.
NEUT19|1 billion is based on a $35 billion valuation, but they have some incentives in place for Alibaba so they have some incentives in place for them to seek a higher valuation.
NEUT20|So Yahoo could actually get more than that.
NEUT21|Now.
NEUT22|I mean for Alibaba, obviously it seems like Yahoo was almost kind of weight on their shoulders and said they couldn't really do what they wanted to do it.
NEUT23|Now they kind of lesson.
NEUT24|I want it anyway because that was part of the question really.
NEUT25|Is Yahoo what do they do with?
NEUT26|That's a lot of money seven?
NEUT27|Yeah, that's what do they do?
NEUT28|If there's a company that just goes through CEOs like their water, they have a lot of questions.
NEUT29|What do they do with that money?
NEUT30|Yeah, I mean, well, they said today they're planning to return.
NEUT31|They said substantially all you know.
NEUT32|So I mean, we can expect returns.
NEUT33|She return it to shareholders.
NEUT34|So I think they said they'll have $4.2 billion in cash after after taxes.
BULL35|You know this isn't the most tax efficient deal, but it was a way to get it done quickly.
NEUT36|You know, get a lot of money right away and they you know they already boosted their buyback.
NEUT37|They said that they're not sure yet the timing or the form of returning the rest of this to shareholders, but you know that they will talk about that later.
NEUT38|You know they don't want to put any, they have a new board, they have new management.
BEAR39|Who knows, there was obviously a lot of pressure on them to do something with this state.
NEUT40|This has been talked about for a long time now.
NEUT41|They're doing it.
NEUT42|Do you think that this is going to satisfy shareholders for an?
NEUT43|For how long?
NEUT44|I think it's going to be at least a short term fix because there's.
NEUT45|Cash, you know I, I don't think that they're going to be investing that cash in the business at all.
NEUT46|It's going to be going back to the shareholders, but there's still a lot of questions for the company.
NEUT47|You know what they're doing with their future.
BEAR48|They don't have a permanent CEO, you know their CEO is just ousted, you know.
NEUT49|So even resolving this part of the company, which was a major concern for people for investors, you know this is just kind of part of their turn around.
NEUT50|"They're a lot of things that they have to do still."""
