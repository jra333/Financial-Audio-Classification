NEUT0|"""Which brings me to the second thing."
NEUT1|You go wrong.
NEUT2|Ever since the press called the election over the weekend, President Trump has doubled down the idea that he's not going anywhere.
NEUT3|Him like him.
NEUT4|That's what it seems like, right?
NEUT5|I mean planning, people say, don't worry, he can't do anything.
NEUT6|Will be a peaceful transfer of power.
NEUT7|I don't know, I'm not sure about that.
NEUT8|I think there are a lot of things the White House can do 12 monkey wrench into the proceedings may be attorney general.
BULL9|Bill Barr finds a sympathetic judge who allows him to seize election materials and disputed states.
BEAR10|Maybe that causes the Electoral College to miss its December 14th deadline.
NEUT11|Baby just causes chaos and uncertainty.
NEUT12|Or if you like Trump, maybe it causes pleasure and fun.
NEUT13|You could argue.
NEUT14|I mean, hey, like I said I've pro Constitution.
NEUT15|But I'm giving you the other side of things.
NEUT16|You could argue that all this stuff is for show Biden's got a comfortable electoral vote margin with bigger swing state margins than Trump had in 2016.
NEUT17|I don't think the car ministration were really trying to orchestrate a coup.
NEUT18|I mean, there's a good chance that just one excuse for losing, but by denying legitimacy of the election and trying to fight it in any way they can.
NEUT19|Well, this shouldn't destabilizing situation, I don't think.
BEAR20|Through the state laws from the stock market perspective, that's a problem, especially as I don't know enough people who are taking the president's tweets very seriously.
NEUT21|Mistake many make during the last four years.
NEUT22|Will this go anywhere?
NEUT23|I don't know.
BEAR24|I just wish more money managers were worried about the fact that we could be careening toward a constitutional crisis.
NEUT25|Some Republican state legislators started floating the idea of overriding the voters, pointing their own competing slate of electors to the Electoral College.
NEUT26|If any of this stuff happens, I'd expect the Democrats to start pushing back any way they can.
NEUT27|But they may not even belong on their side, or at least may not have a judge willing to interpret that way.
NEUT28|I bet you Bill Barr does.
BEAR29|This is not encouraging.
BEAR30|When the president tweets regular about how the election was rigged and then fires his Defense Secretary, it sure doesn't seem like he will be willingly willing to vacate the premises on January 20th.
NEUT31|There's no like, no Marshall, there's no eviction process that I know of him.
NEUT32|Again, likely no real risk.
NEUT33|Maybe not.
NEUT34|Be prepared for it, yes.
