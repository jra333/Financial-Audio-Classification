NEUT0|"""Welcome traders to freetradingvideos.com every once in awhile you wish you could get a trade back."
NEUT1|This is exactly what happened in MHP.
NEUT2|This stock has been consolidating in an area that kind of interesting to see this break out of.
NEUT3|The 100 may run up into a great area of resistance which I'll show you in a minute and then pull back to support at the 100.
NEUT4|This is the crux of a nice pullback by scenario and I was looking to get into that stock.
NEUT5|If you could take out the higher the previous day which again would be.
NEUT6|Right through here next day that happens, then I could just put a protective stop below $38.00.
NEUT7|Never right at the round Number and let me scratch the subject a bit so you can see this great resistance area and we're trading into.
BULL8|So $39.00 you can see that'll fill gap back in this area.
BULL9|Right through here a good bit of resistance up through here, and especially at the high.
NEUT10|So that's what I was seeing before I took the trade.
NEUT11|And then go back to that and tab through it the next day I've filled on that trade.
BULL12|Alright, very good.
NEUT13|We're in the stock and I stop limit order protected as well with my automatic protective stop and the stock goes beautifully.
NEUT14|Right up into.
NEUT15|Our area of resistance.
NEUT16|Alright, so very nice.
NEUT17|I'm sitting here watching.
BULL18|Very good.
BULL19|The stock is going nicely in my favor and I didn't actually exit this trade.
NEUT20|Until all the way out in October.
NEUT21|Alright, so on the 7th.
NEUT22|I'll just go ahead and go over there.
NEUT23|On that day right there, I exited half of my trade.
BULL24|Alright, so not bad.
BEAR25|I even took out a lot of overhead resistance.
NEUT26|Remember all that back there is running up into this area, that's why I exited that trade.
NEUT27|Right on at least half of that position.
BULL28|Right, I kind of stay out in this level and this stock consolidated beautifully.
NEUT29|Actually right below that level.
NEUT30|All the way until I exit the trade.
NEUT31|On that day right there.
BULL32|So this talk is doing a great job, actually.
NEUT33|If consolidating on its high, it's not really selling off.
NEUT34|There's no reason for me to exit that trade, but I did get out of that trade right there.
BEAR35|The entire position is out.
NEUT36|Very nice run, right?
BULL37|So it's a pretty good move.
NEUT38|Took a big chunk out of that until I saw what happened the next day.
NEUT39|Again, if you can't laugh at yourself, who can you laugh at?
NEUT40|The biggest green bar on the chart.
NEUT41|Alright, I'm out of the trade already in this talk never looked back.
NEUT42|This talk took off like you can't believe it never really even pulled back significantly.
NEUT43|I wouldn't have been stopped out of this trade.
NEUT44|On the other half of my trade, until as a pretty big bar coming up here pretty soon, you'll see it as well.
NEUT45|There's also several other entries is beginning of a nice high base break out and then.
NEUT46|Stock actually.
BEAR47|Put in too deep of a correction coming up here, but this is a huge amount of money to leave on the table.
BEAR48|Now I'm just doing a little bit there so almost anybody would have been stopped out of that trade at this point.
NEUT49|But look what I left on the table.
NEUT50|In this scenario, here's the breakout of the curd.
NEUT51|The day after I exit the entire trade back in here.
NEUT52|And this is where I left on the table.
NEUT53|Alright, so I write that up in a Journal, take notes on that, try not to make the same mistake twice and will be better traders from here on out.
