BULL1|With technology advancing, making savings and even investing, your finances has gotten easier.
BULL2|Today we have Gretchen wining Beetle from the Connor Group to discuss the benefits you could have when you work with a financial advisor.
BULL3|Hello Gretchen, thank you for being here.
NEUT4|It's my pleasure.
NEUT5|Tell us why should people work with financial advisors when they are investing apps like Robin Hood, an M1 finance.
NEUT6|Well, the advent of mutual funds, index funds and online investing have been wonderful options for people who don't start out with a quarter of $1,000,000 to invest.
NEUT7|You can get a diversified portfolio starting with this little as $50 a month.
NEUT8|But for all the benefits of index investing, it's still really hard to do it on your own.
BEAR9|The New York Times recently published an article that noted most individual investors underperform the stock market by 3 1/2 to 6% in every time frame studied over the last 25 years.
NEUT10|That's because advanced financial advisors offer more advice than just what investments to by now you've probably heard Vanguard.
NEUT11|They pretty much invented low cost index investing.
NEUT12|They are the go to firm for do-it-yourself investors.
NEUT13|Vanguard's own internal study named the advisors.
BULL14|Alpha found that working with an advisor provided as much as a 3% annualized return than doing it on your own.
NEUT15|That's because advisors help in several ways.
NEUT16|Most people don't even realize.
NEUT17|So an advisor is more than a financial coach.
NEUT18|What correct so that while they might help with financial selection, that's a very small part of what a competent financial advisor is going to do for you.
NEUT19|Mostly there, prompting you do the things you know you need to do.
NEUT20|Just like a coach is doing with top athletes trying to get the best performance out of what people are doing.
NEUT21|Advisors help you develop long term strategies that are customized, minimize risk, and create tax diversification.
NEUT22|But more importantly, they ensure you implement the plan.
NEUT23|That has been built for you, and what should those at home look for when selecting a financial advisor?
NEUT24|Well, one of the biggest things is looking for a fiduciary advisor.
NEUT25|They are obligated to work in your best interest, not what may compensate them the most, and make sure that your advisor is takes a comprehensive approach to planning, looking into your cash flow and income tax analysis your goals, insurance needs, and a state planning that requires a team approach.
NEUT26|Working with Cpas, estate attorneys, and other professionals and an advisor should be very transparent and clear.
NEUT27|About their fees and guiding principles using language that is clear and easy for you to understand.
BULL28|Thank you Gretchen.
