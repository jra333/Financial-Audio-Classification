NEUT3|If you knew were just a baby channel just getting started.
BULL4|So for all of us holding AMC, it's been a pretty awesome day.
NEUT5|We're in the green quickly go over the day we opened up at we close at 782 and we opened up.
BULL6|Started off pretty well, went up to 858 thirty five throughout the day.
NEUT7|We kind of stayed at $8.00 and then we saw some real volume.
NEUT8|We went.
NEUT9|All the way up to 950 and then about an hour later, 45 minutes later, we broke that all the way up to 972 was the high for the day.
BULL10|It tampered off a little bit a little bit of pull back, and then we rounded out the day at 887, were up 13% on the day.
NEUT11|This is good news for AMC, so I'm going to go over the news that has been released in the last few days.
BULL12|BlackRock Inc discloses owning 6.2 million shares of AMC, raising their original position by 59%.
NEUT13|That is a massive purchase.
BULL14|That's great news for AMC.
NEUT15|Robinhood increases buying limit for AMC to 12:50.
BULL16|I'm happy about that.
BULL17|But we still need them to completely open up so people can start buying more shares of AMC and drive that price up.
BULL18|Tuesday short volume was 28%, so it's still quite high.
BEAR19|We had 418,000,000 shares of total volume and 120.2 million of those shares were short, so it's still looking good.
NEUT20|They still need to cover those shorts and we have that that high short volume ratio.
BULL21|So I think things are looking good.
NEUT22|We are in the green.
NEUT23|My prediction for tomorrow is hopefully in between 10:11 dollars.
BULL24|I think Friday is really going to be the big day that we might see that climb.
NEUT25|Hopefully, maybe not.
NEUT26|This is quite the risk, so hopefully you don't have too much money in there.
NEUT27|Just some fun money.
NEUT28|I have 70 shares that I'm holding at around $9.
NEUT29|If it tanks and it's no big deal, I'm OK with them, mostly in it just to join the movement.
NEUT30|The last thing that I wanted to say is if things don't workout if we don't go to the moon AMC, I don't think they're going to go bankrupt.
NEUT31|They're not really talking about it.
NEUT32|The vaccine is being massively distributed.
NEUT33|People want to get outside.
NEUT34|People want to do fun things and something that I love to do and many.
NEUT35|People love to do is go to the movies and I think business will start picking up.
BULL36|And if AMC gets back to where they were pre covid the stock price and the share price will go up $20 to $30.00.
NEUT37|So we can just hold for the long term.
NEUT38|However I would like to see us go to the moon so let's stay strong.
