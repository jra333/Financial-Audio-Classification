NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, in this video we are going to tell you how to use the my scans which is there in the my socket section."
NEUT1|Now there are more than 300 scans and it is not possible for you to track all the scans.
NEUT2|So we introduced my scans where you can stomach the scan that you are tracking and track those from my scan section.
NEUT3|You can mark these as my scans in two ways.
NEUT4|First is click on the scan step from the analytic section.
NEUT5|Once you click on it, you will see various scans on price, technical fundamental volume and delivery etc.
NEUT6|Under each of the broad seven categories that you see, you will get various different scans.
NEUT7|Now you can add the scans by clicking on the start icon at the right end of the scan name.
NEUT8|As you can see on the screen.
NEUT9|The added scans will then get reflected in the my scan section.
NEUT10|Alternatively, you can add the scans in my scans by searching for the particular scans from my scan section by clicking the ADD scans button as well as making it as stop.
NEUT11|So why should we use this feature?
NEUT12|Once this Canada added in my scan section, you can click on the specific scans from it to see the list of stocks, which will praise the particular criteria.
NEUT13|Do you have an option to filter the output you get from these scans?
BULL14|For example, you have improved return on equity as a scan in your my scans.
NEUT15|Once you click on it, it will show the list of stocks which fulfills the criteria.
NEUT16|Now you can filter it by clicking on the filter icon.
NEUT17|So let's say you want to see only NSE stocks with a market cap of 102 thousand code which fulfills this criteria.
NEUT18|So then you need to click on buy importance and then go to select Tennessee stocks.
NEUT19|Similarly, click on the buy market cap and then go to 100,000 crore option.
NEUT20|So what are you waiting for?
