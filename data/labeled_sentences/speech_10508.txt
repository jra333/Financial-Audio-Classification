NEUT0|"""I all these are there, just you want to know how to value them?"
NEUT1|How do you value the winner in a market where they may be the only one that is growing?
NEUT2|Incredibly Scott, how do you do it?
NEUT3|There's no room but don't know how you know.
NEUT4|Rulebook, no group.
NEUT5|You'd think I'd like, but this is not the format is.
NEUT6|You could definitely see that credit Steve Weiss.
NEUT7|Go ahead and then Joe Steve and then Joe go ahead, Steve.
NEUT8|Speech isn't that exactly the point that you can't figure out the value of it.
BEAR9|That's not a positive thing, Jim, that's a bad thing, and that's why when it bursts it's going to come down hard.
NEUT10|Doctor Science ridiculous, of course, it's a covid play, just as Palatine is just to zoom is now.
NEUT11|If they pulled forward demand, that's going to stay with them, yes, but in what sane universe should DocuSign be valued five times?
NEUT12|What Adobe is valued at?
NEUT13|No?
NEUT14|I look, I don't like to pay anything North of 10 times sales I think.
NEUT15|My Chapel trust just doesn't want to.
BEAR16|OK, we just won't run 10 times sales, which leaves like 50 companies that we want on because I fear coming in one day and seeing those companies go down at a day when General Motors goes to 50 and I'm thinking what was I doing not buying something that's 6 * 6 times earnings instead of something that's 60 times sales.
NEUT17|But I have to understand the growth investors mine and that's where you guys are right?
NEUT18|Remember the growth investors some?
NEUT19|I'm still around.
NEUT20|They come on an whatever is the fastest growing.
NEUT21|There's no limit to what they pay.
BULL22|And that's the problem with these talks, you signed a great company.
NEUT23|I wanted to come down, but it won't.
NEUT24|"'cause it's the only game in town."""
