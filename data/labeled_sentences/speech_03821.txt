NEUT0|"""Bank of England today has delivered on monetary easing."
BEAR1|We've got a rate cut from half percent in the base rate down to 1/4 of a percent.
BULL2|We've also got an increase in quantitative easing.
NEUT3|The Bank of England will now by 60 billion of gilts, government bonds over the next six months, and also look to buy up to 10 billion of corporate debt.
NEUT4|These are measures designed to stimulate the economy by lowering interest rates and encouraging investors to essentially come out and buy risky assets, and in particular, we look at the market reaction.
BULL5|The Bank of English should be happy here.
BULL6|You've got a weaker currency, but you've got higher stock prices and higher bond prices as investors react to this monetary easy.
BULL7|If we look at the Footsie 100, it's up 1.4% as we speak, and more importantly, banks are in positive territory.
BEAR8|One of the dangers of cutting interest rates so close to 0 is the fact, as we've seen in Japan and the Europe this year, banks don't like this.
BEAR9|Shareholders have been selling out of the banks as a sector in general because low rates and in particular negative rates, hurt the net interest margin for banks.
BEAR10|Now Bank of England has signaled that is cut down to just a quarter point, but expectations are that it should probably stay here.
NEUT11|Do let Q we do a lot more of the heavy lifting.
NEUT12|And of course we're going to be looking forward to what the Chancellor says in his autumn statement.
BULL13|Expectation here is that now that the Bank of England has moved, we're going to see some kind of fiscal response from the UK government.
BULL14|So if we look at interest rates here across the markets, we're seeing a nice rally in gilt prices.
BEAR15|We've seen gilt yields dropped more than 10 basis points and the 10 year sector we had, and you record all time low for the 10 year gilt around.
BEAR16|0.66% we've also got the two year Gilt yield back below 10 basis points and heading towards 0.
BEAR17|The question that some investors will probably be asking as QE gets going in the coming weeks is whether or not we're going to actually see some negative yielding gilt securities, particularly in the short end in terms of the currency.
NEUT18|Well, that's the big mover.
BEAR19|Pound has taken another drop down today.
BEAR20|It's down more than 1% against the dollar is nearly down 1% against the euro, and this really is the safety valve for the UK economy and this is really what.
NEUT21|The Bank of England, I think, wants to see it doesn't want to see a disorderly decline in the pound, but it does want to see downward pressure.
BULL22|"That helps alleviate some of the post Brexit vote slowdown that we are expecting for the economy."""
