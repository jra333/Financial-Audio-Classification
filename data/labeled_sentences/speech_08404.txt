BEAR0|"""That's right, the most recent economic data has been truly devastating as we just saw again with the housing starts number."
NEUT1|But Greg Abbott has been writing in the Wall Street Journal.
NEUT2|He says that there are signs that things may have bottomed out, at least for now, and joining us to talk more about this is Greg.
NEUT3|Yep, he's the chief economics commentator for the Wall Street Journal, Greg.
NEUT4|I read with great interest your piece over the weekend talking about some different statistics that certainly aren't all encompassing, but maybe some points in time that capture where we are.
BULL5|And it does sound like things are picking up.
NEUT6|How did you come across some of these numbers?
NEUT7|Well, you gotta remember that right now.
NEUT8|This is a very fast moving series of events.
BEAR9|We basically went from a strong economy in February to utter collapse in April as we saw with the housing starts data, retail sales, industrial production, employment in April all showed record declines.
NEUT10|But since then you know some states have started to open up and so at times like this you can't rely on the monthly data which is outdated.
BEAR11|You gotta look at things like daily and weekly data and we have a lot of that from private places like Apple Maps mobility data which showed that the worst point was early April and that we've now seen a significant uptick in mobility.
NEUT12|Can you translate that to things like visits to retailers that are compiled by a company called Unacast?
BEAR13|Same story down 50% in April.
BEAR14|Now maybe down only 30%.
NEUT15|You listen to some of the commentary from companies like Uber or Wendy's.
BULL16|They're saying that the worst is behind them and that the year over year declines are now diminishing, which tells us that on a sequential basis, things are looking up.
BEAR17|When Becky, we may look back and conclude that April was the bottom.
BULL18|You know, Greg the it's great news and it certainly shows that people are having some returns to confident confidence.
NEUT19|I really like the Apple Maps number, 'cause I realized I hadn't used ways in months and I used to use it constantly.
NEUT20|But it gets you back to that point.
BEAR21|That down 30% is still a huge drop off, maybe, maybe not down 50%, but we're not talking about a V shaped recovery in any stretch.
NEUT22|Not yet, but I'm one of those who wants to be a little bit more patient with data.
NEUT23|Before I write off the possibility that will have a decent rebound, let's really.
NEUT24|Let's keep things in context.
BEAR25|Like I said, it was only three months ago that we were at record low unemployment.
NEUT26|That's just three months ago.
BEAR27|You know, recessions typically last on the shortest recession on record before.
NEUT28|This was six months, the longest was 18 months.
NEUT29|It may turn out that this one was only two or three month long.
BULL30|We need to give this one a little bit time to sort of develop some confidence, and as stores reopen as confidence returns to consumers and business.
BULL31|Then you could actually see a self sustaining recovery.
NEUT32|All of that of course contingent on the virus not coming back and there not being a significant second wave of infection.
BEAR33|Yeah, I think the big question so many people have is how many of the furloughed employees become permanent layoffs and how do you kind of go about trying to figure that out.
BEAR34|Well, we know that of about the 20 million people who lost their jobs in April, about 80 or 90% of them said they were on temporary layoff.
NEUT35|What that means is 2 things.
NEUT36|First of all, it suggests that a lot of them are going to come back as soon as stores and companies are allowed to reopen.
BEAR37|But it also means that about couple million at least possibly as many as four or five million people have permanently lost their jobs.
BEAR38|And that suggests that the unemployment rate is not coming back down at three and a half percent anytime soon.
NEUT39|Mostly even that optimistic people you talk to don't see it coming much.
BEAR40|You know below 7 or 8% for the rest of the year, so of course it's kind of, you know Becky is like been down so long it looks like up to me.
BEAR41|I guess what I'm trying to say here is that it is, but it was awful in April.
BULL42|"It'll be a little a lot better in May, probably a lot better in the summertime, but that's nothing at all like saying that will be fully recovered."""
