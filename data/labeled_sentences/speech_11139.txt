NEUT14|What did nobles think Neo Bulls are basing their positive outlook on the fact that China is looking to go electric within the next five years.
NEUT15|This is as a result of abundant carbon emissions throughout the country.
BULL16|China's government has been forthright on the country's adoption of electric vehicles.
BULL17|China's government supports EV adoption so much so that they are willing to give consumers subsidies and tax breaks.
