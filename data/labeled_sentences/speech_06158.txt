NEUT1|July 6 2017.
NEUT2|I'm going to do a little bit of market analysis and starting off with the Excel K. Which is the technology ETF?
NEUT3|The reason I thought this was interesting is because it looks like it is oversold or in this pattern of.
BEAR4|Consolidating lap down.
BEAR5|You can see down here on the Mac D that it's showing that it's oversold.
BEAR6|What I find interesting here too, is that while the price is lower here than it was here, the Mac D is actually not as low, so that tells me there's a divergent with price versus the Mac D. That in combination with it being down.
BEAR7|Getting this divergent and oversold.
NEUT8|Makes me start to get interested.
NEUT9|So what kind of stocks are in the X?
NEUT10|OK, let's take a look.
NEUT11|We look at.
NEUT12|I just did a quick Google search for.
NEUT13|Stocks in the Excel K. And I came up with this list.
NEUT14|And I sort of looked through a few of them.
NEUT15|There's some ones that are interesting, but I'm going to focus on these Verizon.
NEUT16|Everyone's heard of Verizon in my opinion, that sort of tells you a lot.
NEUT17|It's it's.
NEUT18|Everyone can probably say it's not a company that's going to go out of business.
NEUT19|We know their products.
BEAR20|They might go up and down, but it's a solid company, so buying it at the right price is probably not a bad idea.
NEUT21|OK, so I'm going to switch back over here to stock charts and let's actually pull up.
NEUT22|Right?
BEAR23|Verizon its prices are down.
NEUT24|Possibly a double bottom, not sure.
BEAR25|Mcdee says it's oversold.
NEUT26|And if we go and look at it.
NEUT27|Let's see if looking at no point figure chart tells us anything now.
NEUT28|This tells me it would be better to buy it at 41.
NEUT29|Then it would be to buy it at 43.89 or somewhere close to that worth trading today.
NEUT30|So I think this is a stock to watch and try to find a price somewhere between here and 41 to buy it at.
NEUT31|When it gets closer to when you actually get closer to actually making your by decision, it's important to consider things like where is your stop going to be, how you know how much, how many shares to buy, and so on.
BULL32|All right, thanks for watching.
NEUT33|That's all for now.
NEUT34|Keep an eye on this stock and consider it by then the prices.
