NEUT0|"""It's claimed this be a video chart on ticker symbol B MB L. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well IPO day here for Bumble and I mean I'll be honest.
NEUT4|I thought it would would have gone the exact opposite direction.
NEUT5|I thought this thing, I mean, it seemed like it had a good amount of media and hype behind it.
NEUT6|But I mean, it was just pretty much a train wreck.
NEUT7|I mean, you gotta think that there are poor souls that were buying.
NEUT8|All up around here there are poor souls that were buying right there and just to see how far down the price went from there.
NEUT9|We'll see if it can get turned around or not, but you know, just not exactly.
NEUT10|You know the IPO Vermont for me, maybe maybe you thought that this would happen and it just happened and you know what?
BULL11|Good for you?
NEUT12|You got it right?
NEUT13|I got it wrong.
BEAR14|But yeah, what a train wreck.
NEUT15|So as of right now, it's really more so a question of where these levels of resistance that because as far as supports are concerned, because it was an IPO you can't look back in the history and try to kind of figure out where things might be, but as far as well.
NEUT16|Whoops, wrong one.
NEUT17|There we go.
NEUT18|Let's try some, will do some Fibonacci extensions here just because.
NEUT19|I said that's really our only chance right now, so squeezing this down next potential area of support down there at $68.70 and then after 6870 if that level doesn't quite hold off next level.
NEUT20|Not until down there around 65 now if 6870 fails, does that mean that for sure guaranteed it's going down to 65?
NEUT21|I'm not saying that I'm just saying that according to the Fibonacci extensions and how they work then you know it could get a whole lot nastier if there's anything close to repeat.
NEUT22|You know of today that happens on Friday, so keep an eye on those couple areas.
NEUT23|From the support side of things.
BULL24|As far as areas of resistance are concerned, the price does try to bounce back upwards in the very near term.
NEUT25|That first key level of resistance is going to be.
NEUT26|Right there at the $72 mark and then after 72 next key level up there.
NEUT27|Right at the 75 mark, so keep it on those areas moving forward.
BEAR28|As of right now, things are looking pretty rough.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you.
NEUT39|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is again totally live.
NEUT41|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
