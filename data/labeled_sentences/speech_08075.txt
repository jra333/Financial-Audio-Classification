NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to trade time.
NEUT2|In this video, we're going to be talking about Facebook stock ticker, symbol FB and why.
BULL3|I think that it could go up massively in the near future before we get into it.
NEUT4|I do need to disclose that I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT5|This is not financial advice everywhere to stand up here in this videos.
NEUT6|In my opinion all videos on the channel for entertainment purposes only and any information that is shared in any of my videos may be inaccurate.
NEUT7|So here I have Facebook stock loaded up on another charting platform and what I see here is that this red line is resistance.
NEUT8|As far as I can tell, and this line has been holding for the last six months or so.
NEUT9|And now what we've seen in the past few days is that we have broken out of that line, and a lot of times when stocks break out of resistance lines and trend lines like this, they tend to shoot up higher and higher, and I think that could happen in the near future for Facebook.
BULL10|Thanks for watching.
