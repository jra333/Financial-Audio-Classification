NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Won't even say the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but very very impressive.
NEUT4|Move on this one today when you think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here and then it was able to battle back up to where it has.
NEUT5|Any rational person would say, yeah, that's definitely a very impressive move, but that does bring about the valid question of.
NEUT6|But is there any sort of true power behind this pricing?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT8|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT9|And I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves around this area right here at 122.
NEUT11|And why is 122 important and helpful?
NEUT12|And I'm not saying that this was going to happen, but if the price were to come down to 122.
NEUT13|Behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT14|What would that be doing with the price?
NEUT15|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where it just was and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT16|But price movements like go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT17|Now to be fair, no pricing, just go straight up either, so maybe the price does come down here behaves in that manner and then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT18|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here you have this set of those down there.
NEUT19|If you envision each one of those stair steps, well, there you go.
NEUT20|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT21|And that's the name the game.
NEUT22|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL23|It's going to make progress forward and again in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined as 122 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|Key levels to watch initially going to be right up here at the one 2385 Mark and then if the price can push up through there really not looking at anything until up around 1:25, but any angle you look at it.
BULL25|Very impressive bounce today.
NEUT26|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT27|Let's see what happens.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT30|But it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL32|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT37|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
