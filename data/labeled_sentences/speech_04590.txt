NEUT0|"""Well, Walmart is going to get to same day delivery so as Amazon, so they're just making the steps down."
NEUT1|But I think I would have come out with that tweet because they can say will give it to you.
BEAR2|Maybe same day an no membership fee and they've been *** for tat for with Amazon right along.
BULL3|So yeah, I think that Walmart with its 4500 stores that are many distribution centers can keep up with Amazon on delivery.
NEUT4|Can anybody else, maybe not, but those two certainly can.
NEUT5|So I sort of have a three prong question.
NEUT6|I thought if I spend a lot of my day yesterday thinking about this.
NEUT7|Can Walmart do one day?
NEUT8|Should they do it and at what cost?
NEUT9|They can do it and they should do it.
NEUT10|And the real question is just what you said.
NEUT11|What's the cost of them to do this?
NEUT12|What's the cost to Amazon?
NEUT13|They've already told us hundreds of millions of dollars, but what's the cost to everyone else?
NEUT14|Because market shares what it costs everyone else.
NEUT15|Walmart's got to do this.
NEUT16|If Amazon does they can give Amazon market share just because their delivery is not as fast.
NEUT17|But can anyone else keep up and pay the price it takes to be able to do it?
NEUT18|It's really hard to imagine other people can.
NEUT19|Amazon and Walmart both can.
NEUT20|Amazon told us that they're going to spend $800 million in the second quarter alone.
BULL21|They didn't detail it out, so I would imagine that it only ramps up, especially if you get into the fourth quarter where volume is much higher, right?
NEUT22|Well, there's no that's a lot of money, so if you're a Walmart investor, do you want Walmart to spend 4-5?
NEUT23|I'm just guessing billion dollars to get up to that point.
NEUT24|Is that worth it to you to get that market share that you're talking about?
NEUT25|If you're the investor, I'm sure you're going.
NEUT26|I don't want this to happen if you're Walmart, you're saying, I don't really have a choice.
NEUT27|If Amazon does this, I have to be competitive.
BEAR28|Amazon caused Walmart or Walmart's competitive nature caused it to spend a fortune.
BULL29|As we know over these last five years to be competitive with Amazon.
BULL30|And when Doug came out and talked about it, as you recall, the stock went down a lot, but now it's all come back and it's all paid off and Walmart's winning the game versus all of other retailers.
NEUT31|They've got to continue to do that.
NEUT32|I've been watching Walmart as you know, since 1968 they would only came into existence in 62.
NEUT33|They've done the same thing to the rest of retail, right?
NEUT34|They kept making a new step every time and the rest of retail had to follow and they won the game.
NEUT35|They got all the market share.
NEUT36|They can't let Amazon out.
BULL37|Walmart, Walmart, Walmart will fight this battle to the bitter end.
NEUT38|The question is, do you still want to own the stock?
NEUT39|My answer is yes you do.
NEUT40|Like you still want on Amazon stock, these two win the game.
NEUT41|OK, so they're not the only two players than we do have an analyst call that actually just crossing on target Barclays.
BULL42|Upgrading the stock to overweight the firm says that target appears to have the most competitive advantages in apparel and home furnishings, and the stock is up about 2% on this upgrade.
NEUT43|What do you think about this call on Target from Barclays?
NEUT44|I'm not pushing target.
NEUT45|I think target is the third man out in this three horse race.
BULL46|Target has done a great job.
BULL47|They are much better retailer than they were three or four years ago.
BULL48|They were the best retailer in the country in 06.
NEUT49|But now we've reached the point where it is sort of a 3 horse race and I just don't see how they continue to win the game.
BULL50|I understand the call they are doing a much better job in apparel and they've done in years and they're in more in stock than they've been in years.
NEUT51|But they've still got to fight this battle on things like same day delivery with Walmart and Amazon.
NEUT52|"I don't see how they win."""
