BULL0|"""I think it's still going to be kind of in that high teens growth."
NEUT1|We've seen that over the past few years.
NEUT2|You're right.
NEUT3|Is that the base?
NEUT4|If you look at the active basis by bout 1.5 billion last update they gave was in the summer at 1.4 billion devices.
NEUT5|And also I think that's important.
NEUT6|Just want to emphasize something that you mentioned.
BULL7|Is that the iPhone versus the App Store growth over the last two years.
NEUT8|The unit growth we can still back in iPhone units even though they don't disclose them.
BEAR9|There's about almost a 30% gap between those growth numbers, so there's been a consistent.
NEUT10|Separation between new iPhone sales and the App Store, and I think that it is consistent with the overall device usage.
NEUT11|I do quickly.
NEUT12|John want to jump back to something that Josh said in the set up because it caught my attention when he mentioned this is regarding Apple.
NEUT13|Kind of in the bigger picture and how it's driven the market is that the average sell side price target is 11% below the current stock price.
NEUT14|How was sell side analyst for a long time?
NEUT15|I respect the profession greatly but also the reason why that jumped out to me and we think about Apple moving forward here.
NEUT16|Sell side analysts don't get paid.
NEUT17|Typically don't get paid to be right.
NEUT18|They get paid to be relevant.
NEUT19|They get paid for their insights to the buy side, and I think what we are seeing is a some reluctance from the sell side really to get this stock right and I want to try to quickly define what right the right case would be.
BULL20|Microsoft, Google, and Facebook traded a 31 to 35 times multiple Apple has developing a consistency around their business.
NEUT21|That is compareable to those.
NEUT22|If you put a 31 multiple on Apple, that's $465.
NEUT23|That's about 50% upside and so I would just.
BULL24|"Highlight that even though we don't see those price targets moving up on Apple, I think that there is a bigger trend here towards equality in multiples."""
