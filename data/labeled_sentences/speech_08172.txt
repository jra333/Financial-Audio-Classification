BULL0|"""It is a big week for the industrial names which I know you like as well or have liked historically as well."
NEUT1|What are you watching for?
BULL2|Yeah, no, it's a great.
NEUT3|It's a great question.
NEUT4|There's so many data points that are going to, we're going to learn this this week and it's 25% of the SNP companies that are reporting to your point.
NEUT5|So the first thing I'm looking at is I know everybody is watching Apple and Tesla and Facebook and Lam Research.
NEUT6|I am too.
NEUT7|And by the way, I do think the Apple report is probably the most important.
NEUT8|It is a 700 basis point waiting in my benchmark, right?
NEUT9|And so I'm anxious to hear about the 80% of the products and services that.
BULL10|I have refreshed over the last 12 months and what kind of momentum that's going to take us in the next 12 months.
NEUT11|The next couple of years, so it's going to be an important one.
NEUT12|But back to your question on the industrials we're going to, we're going to hear from.
BEAR13|I was gonna start scooting.
NEUT14|The questions started question Freeport Mac Moran for sure is an important one tomorrow because we will hear and it trades like China.
NEUT15|We want to hear about the global recovery Caterpillar.
NEUT16|The same deal.
NEUT17|Dow Chemical.
BULL18|They've done a great job at cost cutting.
NEUT19|Are they getting pricing power?
NEUT20|So all of these industrial companies are important.
NEUT21|But of course, you know my largest position is Boeing, and that one is also going to be extremely important.
BULL22|An GE will tie into that right in terms of the Aviation division, and both stocks have had a really nice recovery off the Lausanne into the beginning parts of this year, so it will be interested.
BEAR23|Interesting to see the reactions and then the other thing I'm looking at is really the consumer globally American Express and MasterCard report this week, and we know that the consumer spend has been kind of disappointing for card spend anyway, especially for American Express in recovery mode, these are reopen names.
NEUT24|So I want to hear what they have to say about the global consumer.
NEUT25|So those are the two segments this week that are going to be very, very important to watch and certainly on my radar screen.
BEAR26|You know we started this hour talking about valuations, and I wonder how you see it, given the fact that we are really getting underway with this earnings season right now, and one of the things we've seen the last several quarters is that the estimates were so much lower than the numbers that actually came in.
NEUT27|Look, I mean there are pockets of this market that are very very rich right and and mainly in the technology segment.
NEUT28|Quite frankly, that's what happens when you have an enormous amount of liquidity and low, low low interest rates, right?
NEUT29|That's fuel for the risk on trade, which means equities, right?
NEUT30|So so I think you have to look at it like some of the technology companies have done so well because their growth and markets are so bold.
NEUT31|Right, I mean you look at AI and you look at cloud a trillion dollar total addressable market by the end of the decade.
NEUT32|Food delivery is going to be a $400 billion market total addressable market by 2025.
NEUT33|Precision farming right up your alley is a $70 billion total addressable market, so I understand why technology has done so well because the growth is there, the free cash flow is there.
BULL34|The market share numbers are there, so you definitely want to have some exposure, especially 'cause we as consumers we understand these businesses.
NEUT35|It's like the Peter Lynch way of investing.
NEUT36|At the flip side that the parts of the market that are not expensive are, the sickles are the industrials right there.
NEUT37|The economically sensitive companies and I want to own them, mainly because I think the economy is in the recovery mode.
NEUT38|The Atlanta Fed, by the way, has a GDP number for the fourth quarter at seven and a half percent annualized.
NEUT39|That's a huge number, and I think that will surprise people, and I think as you go through the year, you're going to have all this liquidity that funnels into the system at low rates, even if they end up higher, that's still.
BULL40|Very very positive for GDP growth, earnings growth and operating leverage, especially for the economically sensitive companies.
NEUT41|So pick your spots.
NEUT42|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT43|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
