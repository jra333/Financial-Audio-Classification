BULL0|"""Thanks for watching this quick video."
NEUT1|An update on track type or Q or the three queues or the cubes as they are generally called or known.
NEUT2|This one is just a trust that follows the NASDAQ 100 Index and NASDAQ 100 index is the major 100 companies traded me mainly in the US, so so as we can see we have found an amazing.
NEUT3|On the line, this dotted red line is showing in one hour.
NEUT4|Candle stick chart issues that the president would be moving upward and the 150 length of exponential moving average.
NEUT5|He worked almost perfectly.
NEUT6|We'd distant line, I mean just he worked as support for those throat sore.
NEUT7|Bottom of this uptrend movement.
NEUT8|So the idea is we are now even becauses stochastic.
NEUT9|Is in overbought, this well wait at the end of this price retracement before going along and before buying, always check the performance of the major company in this tribal QoS trust so the ice I was telling you is Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple.
NEUT10|Are they almost 50% based on this pie chart of the?
NEUT11|A spot them so value and importance of in these NASDAQ 100 day and consequently of these tribal Q trust that follows or tracks the index.
NEUT12|NASDAQ 100.
NEUT13|So.
BULL14|In conclusion, if those companies are performing well.
NEUT15|Sequentially, these trust is perform well as well, so just wait a little bit, adding potential price retracement before going wrong.
NEUT16|And by keep banks.
NEUT17|Oh wait, that this dotted line?
NEUT18|Or perhaps this this exponential moving average will be tested again by the prices before going along.
NEUT19|"Thanks, bye."""
