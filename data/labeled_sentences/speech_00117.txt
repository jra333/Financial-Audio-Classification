NEUT0|"""Let's talk more about the outlook for the economy for markets and everything."
NEUT1|Really.
NEUT2|Oak Tree Capital's co-founder and Co chairman Howard Marks joins us now in a first on CNBC interview.
BULL3|How great to see you.
BULL4|Thanks for joining us.
BULL5|Nice to see you well for it.
NEUT6|I wanted to start on that topic of the economy.
NEUT7|Economic outlook.
BULL8|Having read your most recent note because I guess you're very positive that the economic recovery will be strong.
NEUT9|But not just this year that we are in fact at the start of a new economic cycle as opposed to the tail end of the last one.
NEUT10|Well, I would take issue with your word positive.
NEUT11|I'm never positive about anything.
NEUT12|But but you know, I believe that.
BEAR13|You know, we expect that there will be a recession once in awhile.
NEUT14|I believe last year's recession was that recession for that cycle and that we have commenced anew up cycle.
NEUT15|It's not 100% sure that, but I believe so.
BULL16|And I think things look positive that trends in income are very good.
NEUT17|People are going back to work and.
BULL18|And I believe that you'll see a strong spending this year, but you know, say things have been a very high rate and I think they that the savings and rising income will would bully us in the certainly the few years to come.
NEUT19|And of course, the question that follows is whether markets are already pricing in that economic positivity and you're kind of torn on that overall.
BULL20|Well, I think they are pricing in the economic positive.
NEUT21|It's very unusual to have the market at a high level.
NEUT22|And certainly you couldn't say that this isn't high level at the same time that data recovery is getting going.
NEUT23|Usually high levels on stocks coincide with high levels on the economy.
NEUT24|So Howard, it's Sarah, what sector, if any, what part of the market to operate offers the most opportunity right now?
NEUT25|I think that the the most opportunity is found is always found in the things that other people are ignoring, and I think that.
NEUT26|What they call what they call value.
NEUT27|Although I I differ a little with the terminology, but you know out of favor.
BEAR28|Lower valuations.
NEUT29|You know the sectors that were hurt by the pandemic and where the stocks reflected the pain from the pandemic.
BEAR30|Sometimes to access if you can find it, you can find companies that have been penalized for their difficulties in the pandemic, and the penalty was overdone and the and the difficulties are temporary.
NEUT31|I think that that's that's a good sector right now, although you know, after being trounced thoroughly by tech.
BULL32|Last year, so called value has encyclicals have had something of a rebound already this year?
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
