BEAR0|"""Rick hit on something pretty important."
NEUT1|If you try to figure out what 1.9 trillion means, I'll say it this way.
BEAR2|It means that the collapse between potential and real GDP is upon us.
NEUT3|And once you get to that point because of this massive stimulus, you're going to get inflation.
BEAR4|You're going to get shortages.
BULL5|You already have commodity prices to decade highs, and you're going to see Treasury yields back up if the market were not arbitrating this in the form of long term rates going higher, I would have genuine concerns.
NEUT6|But right now, as we really forecast because of.
NEUT7|The out of phase nature between Fed policy and fiscal policy.
BEAR8|We're going to overcook.
NEUT9|James McDonald, do we have to look at the market differently?
NEUT10|Because as I said earlier, it's not up.
NEUT11|Sort of a run of the mill recession, right?
NEUT12|It's not a great financial crisis.
BEAR13|It's financial devastation for 2010 or 20 million families that work in industries that have been decimated.
BULL14|The rest of the economy seems to be doing fairly well.
NEUT15|Do we need to look at this very differently, and if so, how do we tweak our thinking?
NEUT16|These are extraordinary times, and when the paradox of the greatest threat to humanity in our light time perhaps came in triggers, the greatest financial comeback and in terms of stock prices, greatest rallies on record, the paradox is unreal.
BULL17|We saw an alignment in correlation of deaths, an rates of infection lock step up with the S&P 500 and the Dow, the NASDAQ.
NEUT18|We saw the.
NEUT19|Risk growing in the markets growing and there's a disconnect and there's never been a greater disconnect to Rick's earlier point between Main Street and Wall Street.
NEUT20|They're going to be consequences for this stimulus, but we had to do it.
BULL21|We had to come in and save the economy from going off the Cliff with us not being able to operate as normal.
NEUT22|And so we have to look at the market differently.
NEUT23|Both monetary policy valuations and portfolio asset construction as well.
NEUT24|Everything is different now, well.
NEUT25|And I agree with the James McDonald.
NEUT26|Stay with you.
NEUT27|I mean.
NEUT28|And I've actually said we should have given $20,000 checks to restaurant, hotel, travel and small businesses that were absolutely decimated rather than sort of sprinkle it equally.
NEUT29|But that's a whole different argument and spilt milk under the bridge as they say.
NEUT30|So James McDonald.
NEUT31|How do we look at it then?
NEUT32|Do we look at this?
NEUT33|This unprecedented intervention as just a reason to own stocks long and strong all day long?
NEUT34|Right, So what it's done is it's catalyzed herd mentality, and in behavioral finance we see patterns of of people crowding into a sentiment, and it could be a bullish sentiment or a bearish sentiment.
BEAR35|And to the earlier analysis the things and all big tech have started to come down.
NEUT36|They just took the bull market somewhere else.
NEUT37|The Dow is broken out, the S&P is broken out, and what we find now is a mentality that there's money to be made going long and it's finding a home.
NEUT38|And I think that.
BEAR39|We see pressure here on the Russell.
BEAR40|Finally in the last couple days, but the Dow broke out.
NEUT41|People are finding areas to make money and pushing stocks or pushing areas higher.
NEUT42|Dow transports or breaking out.
NEUT43|It's a bull market in that bull market is going to persist to find pockets of strength.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
