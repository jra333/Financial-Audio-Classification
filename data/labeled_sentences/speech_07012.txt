NEUT0|"""Do you believe Bob Eiger and why he is stepping down?"
NEUT1|What was very curious timing for the announcement?
NEUT2|Things I guess contract run out next year and so he's leaving on time, but there's bringing it forward in the way that he has and the way that they've announced it is quite abrupt.
NEUT3|Way with Bob Shapack, who I think was always in the running to succeed him, but not the favorite by any stretch.
NEUT4|So there were some eyebrows raised yesterday.
NEUT5|Yesterday.
NEUT6|I think Disney shares took a bit of a knock as well, so the timing was quite quite interesting and quite curious.
NEUT7|But again, I guess the point here is weather.
NEUT8|What happens what happens next with Disney with streaming with this big push they've made into streaming?
BULL9|Whether the new management team with Tiger there until the end of next year can continue this kind of incredible success that they've had for 15 years.
NEUT10|Alright, so that's a big distinction.
NEUT11|Matthew, and I'm glad you brought that up because it's not like Bob Eiger is completely out of the picture.
NEUT12|Quite the contrary, he is still the executive chairman of this company.
NEUT13|You know what I mean?
NEUT14|He's just not the CEO anymore.
NEUT15|So how?
NEUT16|How much should investors really, really worry about this, given the fact that Tiger will be on?
NEUT17|Until the end of next year.
NEUT18|I think they'll they'll.
NEUT19|They'll settle down a little bit when they digest this properly.
NEUT20|He's going to continue running the creative side of the company, and he said that pretty clearly yesterday.
NEUT21|I guess that means the exciting in the fun stuff, right?
NEUT22|There's the boring stuff.
NEUT23|The spreadsheets, the operations, all of that will be done by Bob JPEG, but I remember came from that side of the business.
NEUT24|He's not was never originally the kind of creative heart of the company, but it is the most stimulating, most interesting side with the franchises they've got with the big acquisitions that they've made and the.
NEUT25|The kind of creative powerhouse at the business has become.
NEUT26|That all happened under him and he keeps that and I guess JPEG still will defer to him at least until next year.
NEUT27|So the next 18 months, I guess 20 months or so, really a chance for JPEG to kind of look under the hood and see what kind of company is going to be running while I go kind of seamlessly transitions out.
NEUT28|At least that's it in plan.
NEUT29|But as we all know that sometimes things don't always go according to plan.
NEUT30|Alright, so in your mind then Shapwick is he is either long term guy for Disney.
NEUT31|Is he the next Bob Eiger?
NEUT32|Will we see him at the helm for a decade and a half?
BULL33|It's well known that we will, because it's quite an extraordinary run.
NEUT34|I mean, it was 15 years.
NEUT35|Don't forget, I mean he pulled off kind of major acquisitions.
NEUT36|You bought Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel, which is the big transformative one.
NEUT37|These deals, which really transformed Disney into this kind of monster of a company with.
NEUT38|The dominant preeminent dominant owner of IP and have franchises in entertainment and in movies and in television, Kevin Mayer was vying for the job.
NEUT39|He's running the streaming side of the business and their big push into streaming, so he'll be disappointed not to.
NEUT40|Not to get the big job, but you know he may be one for the future.
NEUT41|For here and now, in this sort of business at Disney is with its parks and with his other franchises.
NEUT42|Check is a safe pair of hands.
NEUT43|Tigers run really was pretty pretty extraordinary long.
NEUT44|"We won't see that again anytime soon."""
