NEUT0|"""Hey, what's up here taking Twitter and today I bring you a quick video about Siren."
NEUT1|Siren is a company that focus on cyber security.
NEUT2|And use cloud intelligence to provide the fastest protection available.
NEUT3|I'm their website right now, an.
NEUT4|They say that more than 1.3 billion's users around the world rely on science, so.
NEUT5|That's a lot of people.
NEUT6|They have some products you can check it out on their website.
NEUT7|I will put the link in description so you can do your own due diligence.
NEUT8|That is something really important.
BULL9|An yeah, as you can see they have.
NEUT10|And inbox security.
NEUT11|That secure mailboxes for organizations.
NEUT12|And yeah.
NEUT13|They are cyber security, so they may try to provide solutions for any threat.
NEUT14|And now they're trading about.
NEUT15|$0.82 so it's relatively cheap in my opinion.
NEUT16|An as you can see they have a good resistance about 1:50.
NEUT17|Anne.
NEUT18|In my opinion, they.
BULL19|In the short term, they could retest.
NEUT20|That resistance.
NEUT21|So maybe when the market.
NEUT22|Turn screen again, they will bounce.
BULL23|And with some news, I think that it's really possible to get 100% return.
NEUT24|And it's in a double bottom, so.
BULL25|In my opinion, it's a good ending point.
NEUT26|But do your own due diligence.
NEUT27|I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT28|I'm only sharing my opinions and my thoughts about this awesome company.
BULL29|It have a lot of room to grow.
NEUT30|"In the near future, Socio heaven I have nice trades and peace."""
