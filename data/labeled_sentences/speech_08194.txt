NEUT0|"""Here you know I love a bold call and you're rarely short on those $155."
BEAR1|That's a call that Apple is going to drop 29% from where it is right now.
BEAR2|And I wonder, given that iPhone unit sales have already been slowing, what convinces you that it has that far to fall when they've shifted investors attention to services?
NEUT3|It's very, very good question Jonah question.
NEUT4|I get a lot from from investors.
NEUT5|I think the math works well for investors.
BULL6|As long as they get some comfort that iPhone sales are stabilizing.
BEAR7|And so last year I had a similar coli funsize came down by 15%.
BEAR8|The stock reacted more than 29% at that time.
BEAR9|On that kind of development and then the stock recover because investors got that feeling that now this was like behind us and iPhone sales will stabilize the call I'm making today is that we're heading into a second step down for iPhone shipments and that's based really on looking at this.
NEUT10|The combination of 170 million.
NEUT11|IPhone 10 so the next last latest generation iPhones already being in the wild.
NEUT12|Combined with the fact that people now replace their phone more after three years and after two years.
NEUT13|So that means the better third of the first hand install base is very new.
BEAR14|Latest generation iPhones and that's going to be a hangover demand for this year.
BEAR15|And I see shipments dropping by another about 15%.
NEUT16|I mean is that your worst case scenario too?
NEUT17|And even if it plays out that way, do you think the stock gets to 155?
NEUT18|So yes, definitely just want a mistake on that.
BEAR19|Yeah, you're down 15% after a difficult 2018 seems unlikely to us right now.
BEAR20|If worst case, we think it's down 7 to 10% kind of range.
NEUT21|I would say this.
NEUT22|I think the argument in the discussion Apple has to be much, much more rather than what iPhone units do.
NEUT23|It ought to be more on what the iPhone installed base is doing, which by the way, is growing consistently.
BULL24|And importantly, I get that people will extend the replacement cycles, i.e.
NEUT25|Don't buy a new phone every month, every couple of years I should say, but you're buying more Apple products, be that the airports.
NEUT26|Apple Watch or Apple services.
NEUT27|So I do think the discussion ought to be more broader on what's happening to install base and how much are you monetizing the iOS install base versus just looking at units over here?
NEUT28|Care how would you respond to that?
NEUT29|But I think I like the argument about the quality of apples.
BEAR30|Install base, the quality of its ecosystems away, people, even if they don't feel like they want to replace their phones out of turns, it still feels very much stuck in it in the in the ecosystem.
NEUT31|And that's something that Apple can monetize now.
NEUT32|It's a very difficult equation.
BEAR33|Apple has already increased very significantly the costs of their phones and what have we seen?
BEAR34|People stick to their for longer, so it's kind of a 0 sum game and it's painful today.
NEUT35|It was very exciting two years ago and now it's painful.
NEUT36|Similarly as Apple gets into offering, you knew, knew services and continues to grow revenues from existing services and even as you see Apple, for instance, increasing revenues for other devices like the airports, the watch, all that you see that Apple is playing also with a finite amount of money, and so the upside from this new services and new opportunities are real.
BULL37|I completely agree with them.
NEUT38|It's that there will be valued today.
BULL39|We have confidence iPhone direct revenues and direct profits will reach a real stable.
NEUT40|"In sustainable flow, which we are not there yet."""
