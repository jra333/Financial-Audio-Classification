NEUT0|"""What about crypto?"
NEUT1|Does that ever become a an actual means of transacting?
NEUT2|Yeah, it does still.
NEUT3|Crypto my allowed to say crypto.
NEUT4|I hope I can allowed to say crypto.
NEUT5|Can I bring it up?
NEUT6|I would really like Bloomberg to take this article that I wrote for them in two 2013 out of their paywall, but basically you know my view at the time, which I've held since today I've been changed is that everybody should probably have 1% of their assets.
NEUT7|In Bitcoin specific cryptic, I still believe that today and I think it is just a fantastic hedge.
NEUT8|So if you go back to the conversation this morning when you see the amount of leverage, the financial industry is running an you think about all these dislocations and all these exogenous things that are happening that you can't predict.
BEAR9|There's a lot of risk to the downside.
NEUT10|And it will be great that an average individual citizen of any country in the world has a non correlated hedge.
NEUT11|And I've said this repeatedly at nauseam on this show.
NEUT12|Every financial instrument is correlated, but Buffett accept it.
NEUT13|But tomorrow and uncorrelated hedge it.
NEUT14|That Warren Buffett says, has zero value 0 in here I unless someone pays more, I think he's an exceptional.
BEAR15|Person I've learned an enormous amount built from afar in the few interactions I've had with him, he is completely wrong and outdated on.
BEAR16|Shouldn't the prices have gone up during this current situation?
NEUT17|Haven went down like gold.
NEUT18|If it was really digital goal, I think that you have to look more at volumes.
NEUT19|These are not necessarily event driven strategies, meaning you don't.
NEUT20|You don't want all the digital goals, you know.
NEUT21|He did say that.
NEUT22|No, he didn't.
NEUT23|That's the that's the people say.
NEUT24|I don't think you buy.
NEUT25|I don't think when you know you wake up and you see a coronavirus.
NEUT26|Care in the Dow down 2000.
NEUT27|You should not be going in and buying Bitcoin.
BEAR28|That is an idiotic strategy.
NEUT29|I think a reasonable strategy is to say 1% of my networth should be in something that is completely uncorrelated to the world and how the world works you quietly and quickly over some numbers of time, accumulated position and then you just never look at it again and hope that that insurance under the mattress never has to come do.
NEUT30|But if it does.
NEUT31|"It will protect you because then that thing will be hundreds of thousands or $1,000,000 a coin."""
