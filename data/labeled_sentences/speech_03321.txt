NEUT0|"""It's twofold."
NEUT1|Firstly we had to because of South African Reserve Bank requirements and the way we structured the original acquisition of Slider Call, we had to commit to an inward listing.
BULL2|And Secondly we feel it's a great opportunity to take advantage of, you know, getting exposure to the domestic investor base our cash position right now is about $25 million.
NEUT3|We are in a position where we generate cash good free cash on a monthly basis.
BULL4|So it is steadily increasing.
NEUT5|Yeah, and then we've got expansion plans as well at the moment.

NEUT7|We've got two months.
NEUT8|One of the bituminous man called Magdalena.

NEUT13|We've got a very good strong domestic market both in the industrial side, the pulp and paper cementing chemical industry, and then also of course we sell anthracite into the ferroalloy industry.
BULL14|The situation is really good.
NEUT15|There's a different tightness in the market.
BULL16|We still see strong imports coming out of India and Asia.
BULL17|And then of course as the metallurgical sector in improves, we'll see very strong demand for emphasize.
NEUT18|It's no other challenges than any mining region.
NEUT19|You know you've got your energy costs.
NEUT20|You've got labor.
NEUT21|Of course infrastructure is a big thing, but they still.
BULL22|"Serving opportunities here, I think the important thing for South Africa is to make sure they keep on developing their infrastructure in order to keep up with the pace of you know the way the rest of the commodities are are being developed."""
