NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Wednesday, May 3rd.
NEUT2|I'm Celina necklace technical analyst at xm.com.
NEUT3|Today will look at gold on the daily chart so we can see.
BEAR4|Gold is hovering near 3 week lows.
BULL5|Hit this low yesterday and Wednesday three week low and prices managed to find support at the 200 day moving average.
NEUT6|That comes in around 12:52 an ounce.
BEAR7|The short term bias concedes looking bearish, an RSI has fallen below 50 into bearish territory, so there could be some further downside momentum and this would see gold fall below its 200 day moving average towards the 50 day moving average.
BEAR8|That would be important support as well around 12:49, but breaking below this support at the 50 day moving average.
NEUT9|We see further support at 1229.35 and then further below.
NEUT10|We have 1209.
NEUT11|These support levels are identified respectively as a 38.2% for bonacci and and then the 50% through natural placement levels of the outlet.
BULL12|From mid December all the way up to the April High 5 1/2 month high.
NEUT13|So these.
NEUT14|2 fever Nachi levels will be important.
BEAR15|Support and then below this we could revisit the March low of 1194 but below list we would be looking at a very bearish picture for gold.
BULL16|Alternatively, if we see prices bounce higher from current levels to clear resistance at 1260, break above this could lead to gain towards 1218 other important level.
BULL17|But we need to clear at least the level at 1285 in order to bring back the prior bullish bias that we saw from December to April.
BEAR18|But the medium term outlook is looking neutral since the 200 day moving average.
NEUT19|Is horizontal and not really showing any direction?
BULL20|"Thanks so much for watching and have a great day."""
