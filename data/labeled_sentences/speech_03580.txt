BULL0|"""Good morning in this very tutorial."
NEUT1|I'm going to show you an example.
NEUT2|Of how to do the analysis?
NEUT3|In Google Slides.
NEUT4|So in this project you have to create a slide for each company with the following information, you're going to need the company, the name and the logo, your initial investment, which is the price per share.
NEUT5|I love that date.
NEUT6|If you're in my personal finance class.
NEUT7|You started February 28.
NEUT8|If you're in my admin tech class, the project started March 16.
NEUT9|You can put the number of shares you bought that date and your total investment, which is your price per share times the shares that you bought.
NEUT10|Then you're going to analyze with today's current date.
NEUT11|May 19, 2020.
NEUT12|The price per share of today.
NEUT13|The total price of investment of today's our investment an if you have a profit or your loss a percentage.
NEUT14|So I'm going to show you an example.
NEUT15|I'm actually going to use the students.
NEUT16|Example so.
NEUT17|So the example is Electronic Arts.
NEUT18|Initial investment right?
NEUT19|He bought in February 28 at 111 per share.
NEUT20|He bought 9 shares.
NEUT21|So that means 111 * 9 is.
NEUT22|999 That's his total investment.
NEUT23|For February 28, then he analyzed it to today's date.
BULL24|519 The stock went up $7.00.
NEUT25|His total investment is now 1062 and his profit percentage is 6.31%.
NEUT26|He added the logo, he added the.
NEUT27|The type the companies name you could also.
NEUT28|Insert other photos.
NEUT29|You can format the borders.
NEUT30|Right the colors.
NEUT31|Add bullets.
NEUT32|You can also change the background if you go into slides.
NEUT33|You will need.
NEUT34|Your.
NEUT35|Project initial investment.
NEUT36|228 or at 374 shares.
NEUT37|Well, he changed it.
NEUT38|Right he should have 4 here.
BEAR39|Not sorry, that was overtime.
NEUT40|Electronic Arts right here you go for shares.
NEUT41|Nine shares under 11 and he went all the way up to today.
NEUT42|Today's I want 18.
NEUT43|And got all the information from the project.
NEUT44|I hope this is helpful and if you have any questions just let me know.
NEUT45|Be creative, change your font, change the background.
NEUT46|Format the borders, make it look appealing to the eye.
