NEUT0|"""It's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol Anio."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link will mean that the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but very impressive move on this one.
NEUT4|I mean something about the fact that the price actually gapped down was at that location and then as battled back up to where it has very nice move.
NEUT5|But that does lead to the valid question of.
NEUT6|But is there any sort of true power behind this price point?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT8|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT9|And I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area and that area sits down here at $36.50 fifty cents.
NEUT11|Now why is 3650 so important?
NEUT12|Not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation, saying if the prices would come down to 3650, behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT13|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where it just was.
NEUT14|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly Santa true power to strength or anything like that.
NEUT15|Whereas on the flip side, 'cause it be fair, no pricing, just go straight up.
NEUT16|Maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner and then starts to work the way back upwards.
NEUT17|Now all of a sudden, what do you have?
NEUT18|Well, you have a set of those right there.
NEUT19|You have Lowe's right there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps, well, hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT20|And that's an in the game.
BULL21|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT22|And in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined as $36.50 as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT23|Key Level Watch is all about that Purple line, right there.
NEUT24|The 50.
NEUT25|Moving average.
NEUT26|Currently valid at, let's just call it the $40 mark.
NEUT27|So $40 will be that main area of resistance moving forward, but All in all, any angle you look at it.
BULL28|Very nice movement today.
BULL29|Very nice balance.
NEUT30|Not just a question of can the price build upon this bonds moving forward.
NEUT31|Let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT34|But it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL36|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
