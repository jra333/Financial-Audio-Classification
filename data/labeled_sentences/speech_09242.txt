NEUT0|"""Alright, let's dive deeper into the action with our Marcus reporters, Abigail."
NEUT1|What are you watching?
NEUT2|You know, Joe, it's been a few days since we've taken a look at the S&P 500, an it's technical.
NEUT3|It's stuck in a range between the 50 day moving average in the 200 day moving average.
NEUT4|You would think it would change, but not so much in that range.
NEUT5|Let's take a look at this year and a half chart.
NEUT6|You're gonna have long chart that we've looked at before and the history is telling for what's happening now.
NEUT7|Last year, when the volatility started in the winter and this spring, we see something similar stuck in a range between the 50 day in the 200 day moving average, a real battle between the Bulls.
BULL8|And the Bears neither side having more information, but the Bulls did win for new all time high in September.
BEAR9|But then clearly the Bears taking it in the fourth quarter, going below both of those moving averages in May, back below that 200 day moving average.
NEUT10|All of this suggests were needed that we could see this range that we have right now, at least, testing back down on to that 200 day moving average.
NEUT11|It could make for an interesting and volatile September ranita Abigail, I'm closing it out, taking a look at the Bloomberg Dollar Index, which is rising to its highest since December.
BULL12|All one positive comments about the US China Trade War, which is helping boost risk appetite.
NEUT13|Now, President Trump said talks between America and China were scheduled for Thursday.
NEUT14|Still no specific word on when that happened.
BEAR15|However, China also earlier in the day said it would not immediately retaliate against the United States.
NEUT16|For the latest round of tariffs, the tariff increases rather.
BEAR17|The greenback is higher than most of its G10 peers today, and the Bloomberg Dollar Index has had a few dips during this year.
NEUT18|But marching higher year to date, investors will be keeping a close eye.
NEUT19|"However, on the dollar, as this US China trade talk continues."""
