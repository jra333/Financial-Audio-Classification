NEUT0|"""Just have to get your reaction first of all on on this headline of of the day 2 two factors for it."
NEUT1|One does it continue to build momentum in Bitcoin and test I guess or does it?
NEUT2|Does it potentially mark the top?
NEUT3|And should a company be be doing this?
NEUT4|If it is indeed speculation as an investment as opposed to preparing for transactional purposes?
NEUT5|Thank you, the first question is easier.
BULL6|Yes, it will continue to build momentum.
NEUT7|What did Tesla tell you?
NEUT8|Two things.
NEUT9|One is that this is.
NEUT10|It will be a form of payment and two is that this is an investment vehicle.
NEUT11|So those are two powerful endorsement for the notion.
NEUT12|I want to stress the notion that bitcoins are a currency or money because after all money is a store of value.
NEUT13|Money is a form of payments.
BULL14|So yes, that will build further momentum as to the reaction.
BEAR15|It's going to be all over the place.
NEUT16|Some will see it as visionary, others will say wait a minute if I want to invest in Bitcoins, I'll do it directly.
NEUT17|I don't need Tesla to do it for me.
NEUT18|And by the way, shouldn't Tesla be in cash management?
NEUT19|Bitcoins are way too volatile for cash management, so you can see a whole range of reactions.
BULL20|But for Bitcoin holders, today is good news with him.
NEUT21|I guess Mohammed one common thread behind all of this is debasement of traditional currencies.
BULL22|Does just the further endorsement of their alternative increase momentum behind the downside argument for things like the dollar?
NEUT23|Maybe at the margin, but I don't think it's a consequential effect, but what is consequential is that the argument for bitcoins is evolving.
NEUT24|It used to be in negative argument.
NEUT25|You don't trust the system invest in bitcoins.
NEUT26|You're afraid about inflation, about the basement.
NEUT27|Investing in Bitcoin yields are too low on Treasurys put Bitcoin in your.
NEUT28|Risk mitigation bucket.
NEUT29|Now suddenly we have those reasons and Tesla says there are positive reasons.
NEUT30|Form of payment investment vehicles.
NEUT31|So that is the pivot Wolford and that's why you're seeing Bitcoin prices at 44,000.
NEUT32|What's your take Mohammed on the very quick bounce we had to new highs after that sort of 4% peak to trough pull back and whether it puts us back into overstretch overbought type type levels.
NEUT33|You know, I've said repeatedly for last many, many months the path of least resistance for this money is up.
NEUT34|Don't get in the way of massive liquid and the only thing that will stop it is either a market accident and we came close to 1.
BEAR35|Or Alternatively, the Fed losing control of yields on longer dated bond.
NEUT36|So keep these two things there.
NEUT37|This is a rational bubble.
NEUT38|It is a bubble.
NEUT39|Prices are completely disconnected from fundamentals, but it is rational because there's so much liquidity being pumped in.
NEUT40|And Mohammed just finally in terms of valuations and opportunities.
BEAR41|Do you see the US as as less attractive than certain international markets?
NEUT42|I do not.
BEAR43|I think fading the US too early is a big mistake.
NEUT44|Europe is going to have a lot more problems in terms of of vaccinations and in terms of the economy and the emerging world is still quite precarious in economic and payments terms, so you have to be very selective.
NEUT45|But if you are buying an index, I wouldn't.
NEUT46|I certainly wouldn't fade the US in favor of the other jurisdictions right now.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
