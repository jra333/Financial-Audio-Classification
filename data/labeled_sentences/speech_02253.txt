NEUT0|"""Yeah, absolutely."
NEUT1|So pretty number one.
NEUT2|Can we get this chart on the screen?
NEUT3|This chart is insane.
NEUT4|Yeah, curiosity stream?
NEUT5|Reason number one.
NEUT6|I really like them is just their founder.
NEUT7|He was the founder of the Discovery Channel which owns channels like the Science Channel Animal Planet.
NEUT8|All of those sorts of channels in the best way to describe Curiosity stream.
NEUT9|We've seen the shift from channel driven to menu driven on demand content and curiosity stream is the only streaming service that is 100% solely focused.
NEUT10|On the factual film, along with these sorts of documentaries now I'm sure lots you out there a little sceptical.
NEUT11|Why can't Netflix?
NEUT12|Why can't Disney plus do this?
NEUT13|They can, but the difference is, you know they might have their three to 400 factual films on their service, but those three to 400 factual films are also lost in a vast variety of content on their service.
NEUT14|Between scripted dramas, things like that and currently curiositystream already has like 3100 titles and they have plans to build that to 12,000 titles.
NEUT15|Within the next five years, so all 12,000 titles are going to be factual films and documentaries, so they're really trying to become that household name for factual films.
NEUT16|Whereas you know Netflix and Disney, plus you have a lot of other genres and different types of content in that library, so it's going to be more difficult to find reason #2 I like this company again, it meets my criteria.
BULL17|The last three years, they've doubled their revenues each the last three years, and they have projections to do 80% revenue growth minimum going into 2021.
NEUT18|Two, I think around $71 million in revenue.
NEUT19|That means my first criteria I look for and then number three.
NEUT20|I would just say they don't have a whole lot of debts that meets that criteria as well.
BULL21|And the movement from that Channel driven to menu driven on demand content is just going to help this company, you know, continue to prosper.
NEUT22|"Can I add I I?"""
