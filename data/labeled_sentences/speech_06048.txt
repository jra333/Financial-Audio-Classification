NEUT0|"""But but I want to do one more liquidity related story before moving on because there's so much liquidity."
NEUT1|Who would have thought that liquidity mattered?
NEUT2|You know it's all about outputs, not inputs and an equity.
NEUT3|We never get to talk about outputs.
NEUT4|And now all of a sudden it's all coming up.
NEUT5|But Chamath, who is someone we don't get to talk nearly enough about on this show.
NEUT6|I think we talked about him just enough.
NEUT7|Actually the the the man formerly known as the Spec King who finished you know who had a spec three years ago, now has a whole another model he's going outside to talk to you.
NEUT8|Talk to Chamath last week what happened?
NEUT9|Yeah, so quick catch up for people who don't tune into him.
NEUT10|He's the founder of social capital and I'm being serious.
NEUT11|OK, because maybe the maybe the other jensi founders don't know his whole context, but he's trying to be the next Berkshire Hathaway with social capital.
NEUT12|Which kind of pivoted from a venture capital firm to a technology Holdings firm.
NEUT13|I'll let him have it.
NEUT14|He has two strategies to do this.
NEUT15|Spec is the more one.
NEUT16|He's infamous slash famous for and the.
NEUT17|The next one, and the one that I talked about is acquiring majority stakes in companies or fully acquiring companies.
NEUT18|So most recently he acquired Hustle, which we covered a lot.
NEUT19|Actually he was the first check in.
NEUT20|It's a company that does peer to peer text messaging with a large base of its clientele being nonprofits, government agencies and honestly they don't sell to Republicans and that's their biggest differentiator.
NEUT21|The controversial miss made sense that Chamath invested in it, but no.
NEUT22|I thought it was interesting.
NEUT23|He's really interested as he told me in these companies that show non obvious data links we trying to like fully scoop up startups that can give you give him a lot of data on consumers.
NEUT24|Why I think there's a huge opportunity for hustle which doesn't sell to Republicans to get spanked by Paul Ryan and presumably his back design and make everything whole again.
NEUT25|I have a point.
NEUT26|I want to go back to the idea that she is going to build the next Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT27|One thing that Warren Buffett has famously, in my view, having read stuff about him for a long time.
NEUT28|And I think even a couple biographies 'cause I was really cool as a teenager.
NEUT29|There's a lot of patience, and one thing that Tak folks in general just people intact tend to not have lots of his patients, and so I'm going to be very curious to see how to moth approaches that and how well it goes.
NEUT30|Because if you can pull the patients often by the right companies, hold on to them and build social capital into something super cool has a you know, more power to him, but it's very different than the diverse set of things he's approached in the past.
NEUT31|I mean, to me he's a guy who's always doing something new, you know, kind of rapid fire ish.
NEUT32|Which is great for us 'cause let's talk about you know no beef at all, but like it's not the Berkshire model.
NEUT33|When I think about it, which is buying to hold long term investments and cash generation from companies, I get that and I think one stat that I saw that really surprised me was in 2019 social capital made 1.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT34|And that was through Slack with its direct listing an Virgin Galactic which went public.
NEUT35|There is back.
BULL36|And so for chamade, that's great news.
BULL37|Because that proves his thesis that his way of doing it, he's doing better as a.
NEUT38|He's not a solo capitalist.
NEUT39|He's a chamath, but he's he's happy.
NEUT40|He's happy Alex goes, he's his own genius.
NEUT41|Two data points, 2 does not, in my view, validate the model.
NEUT42|I respectfully disagree.
NEUT43|I think there are two things that make it look very smart in the short term and should be clear.
NEUT44|"I'm sure he's lovely, I don't know, but like I would, I would want more data points before I chart that chart out now."""
