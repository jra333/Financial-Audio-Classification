NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol C Civ."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well, I mean the the obvious, but I will anyways just to build some context here, but very impressive movement on this one today.
NEUT4|When you think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here, but managed to close all the way back up there, any rational person?
NEUT5|So yeah, that was definitely very nice move and that does lead to valid question of.
NEUT6|But is there any sort of true power behind this woman?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT8|Dead cap on Skype move and I have no idea.
NEUT9|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area in that area is down here at 2250.
NEUT10|Now why is 2250 important?
NEUT11|I'm not saying all this was going to happen but just for explanation sake.
NEUT12|If the price were to come down here, behave in that manner and then continue on down.
NEUT13|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT14|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range of the chart where it just wasn't.
NEUT15|I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sign into power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT16|Now to be fair, no pricing, just go straight up either.
NEUT17|So maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner and then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT18|Now what you have while you have a set of those there, you'd have lows there, and if you envision each one of those steps, what do you have?
NEUT19|Well, in this situation you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction again.
NEUT20|That's what it truly strong was going to do.
BULL21|It's going to show and make signs of progress.
NEUT22|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined as 2250 in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT23|First, the level that stands out going to the Purple Line right there.
NEUT24|The 50.
NEUT25|Moving average currently valued at 2535, so keep a close eye on that, and if 2535, when we broke in next key area after that would be up there right around the 2475 ish mark.
NEUT26|So overall though, very nice bonds today, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward, so we'll see what happens.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT29|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR33|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT36|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT37|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT38|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT40|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.

NEUT42|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
