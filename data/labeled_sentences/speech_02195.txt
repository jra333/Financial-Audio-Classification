NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, welcome to my channel."
NEUT1|Let's take a look today to stock Corsair Gaming.
NEUT2|This stalker experience a very important bullish impulse since it started trading at the auction journey that took the prize today.
NEUT3|Two of them here in November in $5152 area.
BULL4|Since then the price corrected to the 50%.
NEUT5|If you wanna see level from there.
NEUT6|It has been trading sideways of the moving a little bit upwards and it's doing that movement.
BULL7|Right now we have seen that it touched again.
BULL8|The 50% level right here and it worked very well.
NEUT9|We can see this is daily candle right here.
NEUT10|That was very important that the price reacted that way and let the scandal.
NEUT11|But of course we cannot.
NEUT12|We cannot trust only one counter.
NEUT13|OK, this is only one signal.
BULL14|We need more signals to to confirm our reversal.
NEUT15|OK, so, and that's exactly what happened.
BEAR16|This candle was not enough because we are seeing the price still moving below moving down.
BULL17|Uncle could probably meet again this and try to to find support again here in the 50% Fibonacci level.
NEUT18|So as it is right now, this is the most important level to watch.
BULL19|If it loses this level, we should definitely look for another supporting system.
NEUT20|One point if you wanna cheat level, this level is very important, not only because it's a 61 point if you will not see level but also because it worked as well as the resistance right here and support after that.
NEUT21|I need to is an important area where the price shoot find a support.
NEUT22|So let's see what it does in the most trick short term, the level to watch is definitely 50%.
NEUT23|If not, she level 32 dollars point 8 two cents and from there next $120.00 point $0.42.
BULL24|This is a bullish talk, although it's been trading sideways for a couple of months already.
BULL25|So if we see the price reacting upwards from this level or even for under 61.81 should ever they should be seen as a interesting opportunity to buy.
NEUT26|OK if we go now to the to the.
NEUT27|Are we charged?
NEUT28|We can see.
NEUT29|But the price is being.
NEUT30|Has been trading in this in this town world channel OK. We can see how the prices be moving this in this direction, so if we see the price, at least recovering the 200 moving average, this purple line right here.
NEUT31|If we see the price breaking about this channel and recovering these 200 moving average, the only one in the hourly chart, this should be seeing as well as an important reversal signal.
BULL32|OK, and all is well.
BULL33|See in the 200 moving average turned up OK if we see the 200 moving average there is.
NEUT34|And the parents are beginning like it did right here, so we can see before this example moment.
BULL35|This could be as well a bullish signal for the stock.
NEUT36|But yet again, as I said, loves to watch 50% financial level, $32 point, $0.86 and below that the 61.8 even at level $28.42.
