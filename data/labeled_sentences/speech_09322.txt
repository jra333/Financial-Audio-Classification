BEAR0|"""Alright, what is going on?"
NEUT1|Guys are so I thought I'd do a little recap or what you guys can expect of Apple.
NEUT2|I mean for these blue chip type of stocks these Fang stocks, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, you.
NEUT3|I mean just just buy a bra is going to go up all right.
NEUT4|But The thing is, there's a point in where it goes down.
NEUT5|You know over here and then it goes up a lot and it's going down right now and essentially people want to know what points you know.
NEUT6|Like these points that you want to buy it and we're going to be seeing what those points are.
NEUT7|Another thing is to start off.
NEUT8|We're going to be looking at the weekly chart.
NEUT9|Now, the one thing that I want you guys to look at is the RSI over here.
BULL10|Now, as you can see these mountains there like a lot less, not as drastic as compared to those big drop over here, which is a support building up now.
NEUT11|As you can see, once support builds up, it's a rocket ship.
NEUT12|Alright, so now The thing is, what does this mean for right now?
BULL13|I mean, obviously we're expected to have great sales as always.
BEAR14|I mean, I don't know why people are buying the new iPhone 12, but again, great sales as always, but it's still dropping right now, but that's 'cause they haven't announced it.
NEUT15|And the Holidays haven't come around.
NEUT16|And that's when it starts.
NEUT17|And this one is going to start blooming, especially 'cause elections.
BEAR18|I mean, elections has a big play in this, but the most thing is that during this time just people I end up selling like this happen less time in December and usually when you see this big would drop, it's going to go down a lot more if you look at the four hour chart.
NEUT19|If you look at the Mac D, the cell signal disc conversion line, the Orange One, it's gone down, meaning it's a cell signal to our so meaning that just this time to sell.
NEUT20|But The thing is, where is it going to drop at?
NEUT21|So that's what we gotta figure out.
NEUT22|So let me just give me a second.
NEUT23|Alright so I got this things up over here.
NEUT24|I'll explain what this is in the second right, but if you look at the clouds over here and again like watch a video on this I'm not going to keep on explaining this, but if you do look at the red line which is your maximum move or it's their maximum and minimum moving average, and once it's above this is a general buying signal, the them crossing on this green line crossing this pink line is a better one.
NEUT25|But The thing is we clearly know it's not if we look at the Mac D over here.
NEUT26|It's a cell signal reinitiating.
NEUT27|If you look at the RSI this pattern over here, it's like a home down home down hump down and it's going to back up a little again like there's always going to be these green candles but we're going to have a lot of yellow counters are a lot of red weeks following and then once winter starts coming around the Holidays.
NEUT28|So like in the next three weeks that's when we can start to see Green maybe, but the expectations are for right now is that?
NEUT29|It's gotta have first round 104.
BULL30|After that it might hit 100 and then we're expecting to go back up alright.
NEUT31|There's just this like little gap over here.
NEUT32|Maybe that's trying to get filled, and then we also have this like really like big green candle over here.
NEUT33|So the fact that I mean, I know it doesn't look like a gap, but if you go on the daily chart it's a little bit more obvious where is that?
NEUT34|Yeah, this thing over here this gap and you had these supports like all of these candles, they're all big.
NEUT35|They're all green.
BULL36|They aren't like these counters over here, so that shows a lot of support.
NEUT37|And basically that's about it.
NEUT38|You know, like don't expect it to hit $100.
NEUT39|They might, but by around.
NEUT40|I mean I'm already buying, that one awaits.
NEUT41|"Once it hits 104 next week I'ma by then and after that its body rocket ship San yeah, you know just keep on by an Apple and I'll see you guys next time."""
