NEUT0|"""I do believe semiconductors Ann as well as equipment names will be beneficiaries of, particularly if if Apple does, you know, go forward with this agreement."
BULL1|With Hyundai Kia I I do believe semiconductor content will grow exponentially given the potential demands that are out there for the Apple car.
NEUT2|And Patrick, you're even willing to name some names.
NEUT3|Which companies are you looking at and why?
NEUT4|And how are you choosing them?
NEUT5|Yeah, I think it's you.
NEUT6|Look down the food chain from semiconductors to the equipment side of things.
BULL7|I really think the equipment industry will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of 'cause of new capacity expansion that is needed.
NEUT8|So names that I do like that will benefit from this.
NEUT9|Include Applied Materials, KLA core and lamb research stuff.
NEUT10|Do you like this?
NEUT11|Potential announcement for Apple.
NEUT12|I do.
NEUT13|I think it's going to take a very long time to kind of see how it all plays out.
NEUT14|We don't.
NEUT15|We don't even have a timeline.
BULL16|We don't even have an announcement right, but it's been great reporting by Phil for sure.
NEUT17|I do like the semi cap equipment companies I happen to own Lam Research.
NEUT18|I think that the autonomous vehicle market total addressable market goes from 56 billion last year to 556 billion by 2026.
NEUT19|That's a 39% kegger.
BEAR20|And clearly the wafer fab equipment number numbers are going to have to go up.
NEUT21|As well, and that's a benefit for someone like a Lam research great quarter beat and raise.
NEUT22|Still a cheap stock.
BULL23|So I like the call.
NEUT24|Morgan Stanley, analyst Katy Huberty wrote very bullishly about the size of the potential market here, getting into mobility and saying it's a $10 trillion market.
NEUT25|Smartphones are a $500 billion market.
NEUT26|Patrick and Apple only only needs a 2% share of this market to be the size of their iPhone business.
NEUT27|How do you think about the size and scope of what Apple could do here and what that might mean for your group?
BULL28|I I I tend to agree, at least with the magnitude of the numbers we're talking about.
NEUT29|Remember Apple great innovation.
NEUT30|They transform the smartphone market, basically created it when they introduced the iPhone.
BULL31|I'm not saying that Apple will do that for the car or the electric vehicle market, but given their track record of innovation and their investment capabilities, this is a much larger opportunity.
BULL32|That yes, if they only get a small percentage of that marketplace, it's still going to be a significant revenue and earnings generated for the company, and I think that's a positive trickle down effect.
NEUT33|Again, for the entire semiconductor food chain.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
