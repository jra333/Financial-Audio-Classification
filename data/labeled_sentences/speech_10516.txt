NEUT0|"""As for modern about Jim, these briefing docs are interesting."
NEUT1|Once again, some of the charts looking at efficacy, placebo versus the drug itself suggests that you start to see efficacy well, as in Pfizer after the first dose.
BULL2|Yeah, this is fabulous.
NEUT3|I think people have to start recognizing that there's going to be a lot of vaccine.
NEUT4|There's going to be Moderna.
NEUT5|I think it's gonna be J&J abatis news just now bout testing but there is a possibility that these companies will produce on mass.
NEUT6|A huge number of vaccines.
NEUT7|Don't underestimate these companies.
NEUT8|They were all understanding that this could happen and they have a lot of firepower to be able to do a lot of things that a lot of money J&J is the one I'm really hoping for that comes in a lot of the ones we thought for Europe that Glaxo is behind Astra Zeneca behind, but David the possibility that we get therapeutics Merck were generally the possibility that we get vaccines.
NEUT9|Moderna Pfizer J&J the possibility that we get.
NEUT10|A bridge from Congress and suddenly you're in a position that you were in last year at this time.
NEUT11|It could be very good, David, don't you think the market is already taking account of that?
BEAR12|You know, I'm really wrestling with that because I think that there are a lot of stocks that are so high because people feel like what I just said is going to happen.
NEUT13|But there are also a lot.
NEUT14|A lot of companies that I think are really struggling that won't struggle.
NEUT15|And here I'm thinking about the airlines.
NEUT16|I'm thinking bout hospitality.
NEUT17|I'm thinking about the the non zoom economy we keep talking about the zoom economy but I do think that there will be people of pent up demand.
BULL18|David I think could be extraordinary.
NEUT19|I I think you're right, you know, certainly you would expect that there was going to be a lot of people who want to do a lot of things that they have not been able to do over what could be a full year at the point we actually get back to that right?
NEUT20|What are we talking?
NEUT21|The great Exodus took place on March 14th in this part of the country is what I refer to it as, and it's unlikely we get back to anything like normal until at least then though Jim, so we're talking what first, probably second quarter.
NEUT22|Hopefully the summer when you really are sort of a full return.
NEUT23|Obviously certain parts of the country sooner than others, although when you look at it right now it's not good anywhere.
NEUT24|Weather in California or Texas or a lot of other states in terms of at least new cases.
NEUT25|At this point, yesterday was a day that was the market changes every day.
NEUT26|Yesterday was a day that we're bout lockdown and I always look at Palatine.
NEUT27|By the way, if people want to look at this, look at Palatine that is the tale of the tape that goes up 345 points, one more lock down day, it goes down the same when were want to open day Quil, the thing I'm watching most is what's happening in New York.
BEAR28|The shutdown of restaurants 1314 million people involved in restaurants.
NEUT29|There are a lot of people back and forth on Twitter.
NEUT30|I don't want anything shut down, but if they have to shut it down for health purposes, then we need some sort of compromise.
NEUT31|We need some compromise about unemployment benefits.
BEAR32|I think that people don't realize that we're so close.
NEUT33|Carly were so close, how can the government not agree to fund until we get vaccine, say, even if it's davidsville, which I think is going to be a little later than I think, then what can happen?
BULL34|We are so close to getting this economy back on track, but these places that close Carl.
NEUT35|They can't focus which and open.
NEUT36|Again, that's just way of life.
NEUT37|You can't do it.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
