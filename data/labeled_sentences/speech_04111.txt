NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol Ba ba."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, quite eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|Big volume, big price movement all over the place.
NEUT6|And definitely, you know quite a few eyeballs can be watching this moving forward.
NEUT7|But just to summarize, today's price movement.
NEUT8|In trading jargon, this was, you know what would be known as a gap in trap.
NEUT9|What do I mean by that?
NEUT10|If maybe you're new to the markets?
BEAR11|Well, on Wednesday the price closed down there and then this morning the price opened up there.
NEUT12|Hence what is known as a gap in this situation.
BULL13|Very respectable, very nice looking gap up.
NEUT14|And then that's where things got savaged 'cause the opening Bell Rang.
BEAR15|There was a bunch of poor souls that were buying all around this area and you can see from there basically all selling.
BEAR16|Price for the rest of the day as a lot of downwards momentum showed up.
NEUT17|So yeah, that's the gap in trap that's taking place, which now brings about a couple of very, you know, interesting dynamics.
NEUT18|The first one being is this level going to hold down there at 222.
NEUT19|Now to be fair, maybe 222 doesn't even get tested, but like I said, I'm I'm sending a pretty obvious thing when I say, yeah, there's very clearly a lot of downward pressure that is shown up.
NEUT20|So for me to think that the price, could, you know, make just a little bit further downwards to 222?
NEUT21|Not a guarantee.
NEUT22|Absolutely not, but is it at least reasonable?
NEUT23|Is it at least a rational?
NEUT24|Thoughts have?
NEUT25|Yeah, absolutely is.
BULL26|And there's gonna be a lot of people watching 222 'cause when you look back here through the history of the chart, you can see that generally speaking, that has been a very important level of support.
NEUT27|So like I said, if the price does get down there going to be a lot of curious people.
NEUT28|If the price does not hold above it.
NEUT29|The next level of support would then be down there right around 2:20 fifty.
NEUT30|But to be fair, maybe the single sentence starts to turn itself around.
NEUT31|So in that event where these main levels of resistance app and the first key level of resistance can be right there at two 2650, so keep a very close eye on that.
NEUT32|If like I said, the price does try to turn itself around, but as right now very apparent, a lot of downward pressure has shown up, but we'll see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT33|Moving forward.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT36|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR40|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.

NEUT46|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
