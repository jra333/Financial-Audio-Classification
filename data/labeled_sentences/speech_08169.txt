BULL0|"""Hey, what's going on again everybody, thanks for joining another video today."
NEUT1|I'm going to show you why you should not be purchasing any stocks right now and why you should wait it out.
NEUT2|So in front of us we have the NASDAQ futures/ enqu.
NEUT3|The NASDAQ is showing us what the overall market is doing right now.
BEAR4|So if you look closely here, you'll notice that the NASDAQ has been very bullish.
BEAR5|It was three big bullish green candles, each one of them is losing volume, indicating that the trend is getting weaker and weaker at every push up.
NEUT6|Usually after I push up the stock needs a pullback.
NEUT7|Take a break before can continue making higher highs.
NEUT8|That's the first indicator.
NEUT9|The second indicator is the NASDAQ is currently forming a evening star.
NEUT10|If you look at this candle right here, it's a big green candle followed by a red doji candle, and the red doji candle has a lot more volume.
NEUT11|This is on the daily charts.
NEUT12|Alright, so when we look at the evening star, it's a big red.
NEUT13|Sorry, a big green candle followed by the Red doji candle and a big red afterwards.
BULL14|If this big red forms tomorrow, we can expect another sell off to potentially this support level down here OK, and then depending on the news, we might be able to see another push up.
NEUT15|That's the first indication of why you should not buy a stock, because you know all the big tech stocks especially will be following the NASDAQ.
NEUT16|Second point is the US economic calendar.
NEUT17|So this calendar essentially is going to show you what's happening in the world and what news and numbers are being released.
NEUT18|The market tends to follow one specific thing all the time through my experience, and that is the feds talking.
NEUT19|So tomorrow, Wednesday, April the 7th we have the Dallas Fed president, the Richmond Fed president, talking.
NEUT20|At 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM, so we can expect some choppiness on Wednesday.
NEUT21|On Thursday, not only do we have the initial jobless claims, which the market also likes to follow, but we have the same Louise Fed president talking at 11:00 o'clock and the biggest one of them all is the Fed Chairman, Jerome Powell on the global economy at noon.
NEUT22|The whole market is going to be waiting just for this guy specifically, so you know whatever he says is going to drive the market up or down, whether it's good or bad.
NEUT23|It's our job just to wait it out and see what happens.
NEUT24|Alright, so that is everything for today guys.
NEUT25|I guess one last thing is if you look at the RSI it's also reaching the overextended side.
BEAR26|The Mac D lagging indicator is starting to show signs that the trend could potentially reverse so you know everything is just pointing into the direction where the market should be taking a pull back if not a sell off, and then maybe a pull back down to the support before the potential continuation up.
NEUT27|You guys like the video.
NEUT28|Please feel free to give me a thumbs up.
NEUT29|I'll be trying to post videos a couple times a week, updating everybody with the current market conditions as well as which stocks to buy and sell.
NEUT30|"Peace."""
