BEAR0|"""US consumers are spending less, but the stock market keeps hitting new record highs."
NEUT1|It's time to ask.
NEUT2|Have equities broken up with the real economy?
BEAR3|Credit card transaction data suggests that American consumers spent about 4% less in September 2020 then they had in the same month the year before.
BULL4|At the same time, certain U.S. equity indices hit record highs in August and early September.
BEAR5|But when we take a closer look at the equity market in real time, consumer spending data, the idea that stocks have done well while the economy continues to suffer is at best.
BULL6|Half true, there's no question that the NASDAQ dominated by big name tech stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon Alphabet, and Facebook have defied the slack in consumer spending.
NEUT7|But the NASDAQ has left everything else into Dust 2, including more broadly based equity indices like the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000.
NEUT8|These two indices have tracked consumer spending closely, especially the Russell 2000, an index of smaller companies with a relatively low waiting to technology stocks.
BULL9|Many of these smaller firms were hard hit during the April and early May lockdowns and once those lockdowns were lifted they recovered in line with consumer spending.
NEUT10|So how does an economist look at consumer behavior during the pandemic?
BEAR11|Consumers are still spending, but their needs and options have changed, and that's having an impact on the economy.
NEUT12|Take groceries for example.
BULL13|People aren't eating out as often, so grocery stores sales have been running consistently at about 10 to 12%.
BEAR14|Above normal other sectors are not doing so well.
BEAR15|Apparel in general merchandise are down about 7 1/2 percent consumer health care spending not covered by insurance is down by about 12 1/2% and restaurants.
BEAR16|They're down 27%.
NEUT17|So clearly we can see that changes in consumer behavior do not impact all economic sectors equally.
NEUT18|Here's the real story.
BEAR19|According to an economist, have equities truly broken up with the real economy?
NEUT20|The answer is that it depends on the equity.
BULL21|"Some equities have, particularly among large cap technology, telecommunications, and consumer discretionary names, but most other sectors and most smaller companies remain firmly tethered to the reality on the ground."""
