NEUT0|"""Hey guys, so today when I talk to you about one stop Cinedigm CIDM is a ticker."
NEUT1|OK my name is Nicholas from Hawaii.
NEUT2|I've identified this stock Cinedigm as a fantastic ****.
NEUT3|They're going to want to have in your portfolio in my own personal opinion.
NEUT4|OK, I think this is gonna get about $10.
NEUT5|OK, and here's why.
NEUT6|Let me tell you why, right?
NEUT7|Number one.
BEAR8|It's up low, low, medium public float stock, which means that it has very few shares available in the market.
NEUT9|OK #2, this stock is in the digital space.
BULL10|It's a media player and is doing extremely well.
NEUT11|It has actual revenue and let me tell you the next the next point.
NEUT12|OK, there's a lot of good investors that are involved in this stock.
NEUT13|OK and so forth.
NEUT14|OK, now.
NEUT15|Right now is it raining season right in November to February?
BEAR16|Right now the stock is that I've had about another $0.38 out of the court recording of this video and I recommend you buy as many shares as you can below $1.50 because the stock is just not going OK.
NEUT17|Please expect this stuff to get to be actually to be at 4 to $5 very very, very soon.
NEUT18|OK, now with that said, I'm going to show you my account for TD Ameritrade.
NEUT19|I want to chart of see IDM Cinedigm.
NEUT20|And before I do that, I want to tell you something.
NEUT21|OK, there's an amazing author.
NEUT22|He's from Las Vegas.
NEUT23|His name is Sean Christopher.
NEUT24|He's written three books.
NEUT25|I recommend you start with reading one of his books, but limited his books.
NEUT26|Book number One, Trader Raider book.
NEUT27|#2 trader, trader #2.
NEUT28|And #3 the billionaire mind would be OK.
NEUT29|He's been speaking about Cinedigm different investments, including real estate, will definitely.
NEUT30|Synonym is 1.
BULL31|He's invested in heavily invested in, by the way, so Cinedigm is a great stock in my opinion.
NEUT32|They should get involved in now.
NEUT33|With that said, let me show you the account, the charts Cinedigm for the past 90 days so I can give you perspective on on what can happen when you invest in stocks like this.
NEUT34|OK, so if you can see this chart here.
NEUT35|You can see the stock is.
NEUT36|It was mostly kind of floating right around 60 to 70 to $0.80, right for quite awhile then it spiked as you can see it got to a dollar.
NEUT37|Thirty eight cents most recently right.
NEUT38|So if you would have logged in your position about a week ago at $0.69, you would have doubled your money by now.
BULL39|That's a 200% increase in about a week, OK?
NEUT40|Now, resources are not typical.
NEUT41|This is just my opinion and my own personal experience, but I want to share this with you OK, Now imagine.
NEUT42|You have $2500 for say $5000, right?
BEAR43|So if you have 5000 year eight doubles away from getting to $1.2 million.
NEUT44|OK, so let's break that down.
NEUT45|You have 5005 to 10 is first double 10 to 2020 to 4040 to 8080 to 161 sixty three 2320 to 640,642 one million 280,000 right?
NEUT46|So that's a double date with guys, so I hope you get that perspective.
NEUT47|I learned from himself so I just hope you get involved.
NEUT48|You know I want to do this video to share my experience.
BULL49|Share stole my growth that I've had in the stock and I just hope you blocked.
NEUT50|Dollar 50 and just ride the upset guys.
NEUT51|Enjoy it.
BULL52|OK, thanks for watching.
NEUT53|"Take it."""
