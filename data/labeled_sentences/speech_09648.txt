NEUT0|"""Alright, well let's go beyond the ticker."
NEUT1|We have Elon Musk tweeting that his boring company will have its Las Vegas commercial tunnel, hopefully fully operational in 2020.
NEUT2|When asked about an update on projects in the Bay Area, Muscat, we did.
NEUT3|Boring Company is completing its first commercial tunnel, invegas going from the Convention Center to the strip.
NEUT4|Then we'll work on other projects.
NEUT5|Julia, it's interesting.
NEUT6|The timing of this.
NEUT7|Do you buy it?
NEUT8|No, I think this is a goofball project.
NEUT9|We we keep talking about these boring company tunnels, whether it's in the LA area Veigas Let me tell you something about Las Vegas because I frequent that city for work only you go from the airport to your hotel.
NEUT10|Oh big, what do I need to get there faster?
NEUT11|And they're always like oh the traffic so bad it's not that then actually kind of want to look at the strip when you're there and then guess what you're in your hotel casino.
NEUT12|You're not going anywhere.
NEUT13|You're walking around less.
NEUT14|He wants to put a boring tunnel in my casino hotels I can get back to my room faster and they have to.
NEUT15|I don't know.
NEUT16|It's just a lot of walking in Vegas.
NEUT17|You don't ever see the sunlight.
NEUT18|So basically your taxi ride your Uber ride from the airport is the last chance to even see sunlight.
NEUT19|See the outside and you're saying, well, you're there.
NEUT20|Elon go focus on the Tesla deliveries.
NEUT21|Focus on solar City work on those solar panels.
NEUT22|Who needs the boring company?
NEUT23|Actually unless you come here to the New York City and fix the subway.
NEUT24|Well, Dan, I know that you're going to be out there for CES.
NEUT25|You might not want to be traveling around the city, but you're going to force to be going all of these different locations.
NEUT26|What do you think about this?
NEUT27|Yeah, I mean, God, I wish it was going to be opening for CES because there really is.
BEAR28|I mean, the city is inundated.
NEUT29|It's the largest convention that they have.
NEUT30|So getting around is virtually impossible for talking about cab lines that are upwards.
BEAR31|Of an hour long traffic that will have you sitting there for 40 minutes just to go through one light so it really does get bad.
NEUT32|I do think that this is an interesting idea whether or not will eventually see something like this on a grand scale, perhaps on the East Coast and the West Coast.
NEUT33|I think that remains to be seen.
NEUT34|This is really seems to be the main test of whether or not it will come to fruition.
NEUT35|Alright.
