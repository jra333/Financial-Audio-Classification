BULL0|"""Skinny in a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 31st of March 2021.
NEUT2|When is state, it's a day of the week we are at #23 Tron Vertical TRX for Tron against Busy.
NEUT3|Yeah, we are kind of.
BEAR4|OK, OK for trying against BTC here.
BEAR5|We're still down in the trenches.
BEAR6|This is a falling.
NEUT7|Which that Ron has been in ever since coming on.
NEUT8|Yeah, since January 2018201920202021 so he's been 910 eleven year for the better part of three years.
BEAR9|Tron has been losing value Satoshis against BTC so things have not been looking perky for right.
BULL10|For clients are perky, he will see them doing very well against BTC, but that's not happening for Trump yet.
BULL11|Maybe we could see some bullishness coming.
NEUT12|Tron has many times.
NEUT13|Attempted to break the skinny pink line in to establish a bullish trend, but every time we break this keeping link, we breakdown.
NEUT14|We break it.
NEUT15|We prevailed on what's going to happen.
NEUT16|Potentially we could break it and potentially we could break down.
NEUT17|However, this time it could be different, as in like we could break it and we could continue higher, right?
BEAR18|However, I don't see any clear signs of bullishness yet from Trump.
NEUT19|No clear.
NEUT20|In Polish patterns here, maybe this could be an ascending triangle coming on for Trump, right?
NEUT21|Very one fairly two very tree poem, but we're not entirely sure, because because to pop lower right?
NEUT22|There's just no clear.
BULL23|Bullish reversal shop Athens for Trump.
NEUT24|At this point of time, maybe next week, next month, next year we might see something more clear, but not at this time.
NEUT25|Alright, be careful about going to trade too soon for thrown against BTC.
NEUT26|Yes, we want to turn against USD T, But before that please give this video like you enjoyed it.
NEUT27|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about thrown in the comments below for trying against USD.
NEUT28|TI think we're in the midst of a wave tree, right?
NEUT29|So normally when things move impulsively towards the upside, removing five ways.
NEUT30|12345 right?
NEUT31|1/2 we're in the midst of a tree.
BEAR32|We have a target over here at 7.7 cents for Tron against USD T, and we still expect 7.7 cents to be hit.
BULL33|Boom hit 7.7 cents.
NEUT34|Maybe completing a tree, and after that we get a fallen palm.
NEUT35|We go back out for a 5 to $0.20.
NEUT36|Maybe.
BULL37|Yeah, we have a potential move towards the 4.236 of D. Train based feet extension.
NEUT38|So potentially we could hit $0.20.
NEUT39|However it is still too early to tell and we're still very early early stages in anyway.
NEUT40|Anyway there are.
BEAR41|There's already a very clear double bearish divergance lower high on the mic, D lower high under RSI butter higher high on the price, so this means that potentially there could be a reversal coming on full Tron.
BULL42|Yes Sir, double bearish divergance.
NEUT43|You know it's a sign that things could be reversing right?
BEAR44|There could be a deep correction coming.
NEUT45|We can say for sure, so we're not going to be rushing into anything for Trump at this point of time, so.
NEUT46|You know, clear trade with patterns over here.
NEUT47|There are some signs of a potential reversal, but nothing much at this point.
NEUT48|So be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT49|Alright, I guess I see for my Tron technical analysis.
BULL50|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL51|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT52|"I'll see you in the next video."""
