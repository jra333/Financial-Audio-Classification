NEUT0|"""Take a look at the Dow this morning as we are looking for 30 K we need 408 points actually."
BULL1|408.73 tantalisingly close here John and I think I think we just did it.
BULL2|Another historic milestone for the Dow at 30 K for the first time ever.
NEUT3|Yeah an energy and materials process.
NEUT4|Industries finance leading the way.
BULL5|Boeing having a strong day today along with Chevron.
NEUT6|JP Morgan, IBM.
NEUT7|I mean, it's really something to behold called the year that we've had the tragedy.
BULL8|The market gyrations to be hitting 30 K here in the week as we're heading up to Black Friday.
NEUT9|Who knows what the rest of the year has to hold, but the markets certainly going through quite a bit.
NEUT10|Let's bring in Mike Santoli, our senior markets commentator, who talked a bit about this this morning on squawk, and what's happened?
NEUT11|What's what's passed under the under the bridge Mike since the first time we hit 20?
NEUT12|K yeah, but there was a time this summer where you know the thinking was maybe maybe.
NEUT13|Growth gets us there all by itself and then we saw this broadening out as the vaccine came in to interview for sure.
NEUT14|In fact, the tone of the market in the last several weeks anyway has been much more about Dow type stocks, not not small ones, 'cause of course they're big in the Dow, but cyclical.
NEUT15|Global industrials energy as well, and they've all been more or less prioritized here by investors as everybody is fixated on 2021 as a rebound year for profits for the economy.
NEUT16|For consumer behavior.
NEUT17|For public health, everything is is lining up right here, and I really think the main question is how do the kind of momentum favoring seasonal forces where you do have this upside bias?
NEUT18|You do tend to finish strong when you've had a strong year.
NEUT19|How does that play against?
NEUT20|The fact that I think a lot of folks have already rushed into that position of trying to capitalize on that, and you do have some some things flashing yellow lights about sentiment about investor positioning, and about how much we've already baked in in terms of rebound potential.
NEUT21|So all that stuff, I think Dow 30,000 gives you an occasion to try to assess that tradeoff.
NEUT22|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT23|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
