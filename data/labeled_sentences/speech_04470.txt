NEUT0|"""And then today we're watching this initiation of Disneya Goldman with a buy and a 137 target."
BULL1|They say that parks will recover.
NEUT2|Yeah, look, I think that one of the problems we have with parks over and over again is social distancing.
NEUT3|You simply can't put as many people in a place.
NEUT4|I when I read the comments and people are saying listen, it's so great, there's no line.
BEAR5|I would cringe if Iran, Disney, 'cause the the whole anamesa profit.
NEUT6|There is the line this.
NEUT7|Goldman piece is brilliant 'cause it uses a term that we first thought about.
NEUT8|Netflix was a $50 billion company out of $240 billion.
NEUT9|Company content is King David.
NEUT10|This is about court cutting.
NEUT11|It's not about the wonderful world of color.
NEUT12|Cord cutting is continuing at a rapid pace and that does figure into a lot of the the analysis that we're seeing from from various people who follow these companies.
BEAR13|Jim the the numbers are staggering.
NEUT14|As you might expect, it's interesting because.
NEUT15|If you cut the cord these days, I mean YouTube TV, right was 4999.
NEUT16|Now they get 6499 or will soon be 6499.
NEUT17|You're not seeing people then go to those over the top services that basically create the cable universe for you in a different way.
NEUT18|You're just seeing them leave and not come back.
NEUT19|They're not going to pay for ESPN anymore on a different platform.
NEUT20|They're only going with what is available to them in terms of the SV ODS and things of that nature, so you know we'll have to wait and see how it all shakes out.
NEUT21|But it's interesting 'cause the price comparison, which was a beneficial one for some time, may not really be there as much for some of the other.
NEUT22|Those players such as You Tube TV, ANAN, many of the others that were aware of that have created these universes over the last whatever five years.
NEUT23|Yeah Carla, I feel I don't want this recommendation from Goldman thin gruel.
NEUT24|My Chapel trust is on Disney since my childhood started, but I do think that like David this stuff so expensive they need sports like so many other companies.
NEUT25|They need sports esports.
NEUT26|Come back, it's a win but yeah, I mean ESPN is very interesting because if you go to their website it's all ultimate.
NEUT27|It's all Fight Club Fight Club, Flight Fight Club and then they'll be something that remembers Ted Williams.
NEUT28|I don't know.
NEUT29|I mean there is.
NEUT30|Throwback the whole site reads like a throwback and then that was a throwback.
NEUT31|I don't know.
NEUT32|I want to go forward.
NEUT33|"I don't want to throw back."""
