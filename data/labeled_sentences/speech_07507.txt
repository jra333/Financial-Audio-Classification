NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video today we're going to take a look at the cryptocurrency vet, which is Vechain against tether US based off of finance prices."
NEUT1|So I'm just doing an update video from my last technical analysis video about two days ago, right after this red candle here, I'd kind of outlined that we were kind of starting to form this wedge here, and you could have played around with you know where you had this trend line based on the wake for the bodies of the candle, but ultimately this one was kind of staying up high and tight.
NEUT2|Finally broke out of that about 95 cent level.
NEUT3|That we had outlines and then once it had cracked out, like or not, the $0.95 of the 9.5 cent level that we had outlined.
NEUT4|And once they got above that it cracked.
NEUT5|You know.
BULL6|Ultimately $0.10 kind of like we had thought was possible in gave about another 7 to 8% from there.
NEUT7|So I mean this one offered almost 20% just from that last video.
BULL8|2 days ago lot of volume came in had a beautiful candle today over the $0.10 mark closed above it.
NEUT9|So at this point what I want to see moving forward.
BULL10|Is I want to see some more consolidation around like the 9.8 to 10 cent kind of level.
NEUT11|I think that's kind of the level I want to see held on the daily chart.
NEUT12|We lose that, probably like that.
NEUT13|9.59 point 6 Cent level is a logical spot, but you know, those are some of the levels to watch.
NEUT14|The last level of support would be the bottom of this trendline, but that's about, you know, 15.
BEAR15|Not quite 15, but like 10 to 12% off, so it's a little bit lower for sure.
NEUT16|So that would kind of be like the third level of support, so I want to take that 9798 cent or 9.7 sorry 9.8 cent range hold below that.
NEUT17|We're going to look at like that 9.4 cent level and then below that you know the bottom of this trend line.
NEUT18|Those are my 3 support levels I wanna see hold to turn this one bullish.
NEUT19|I mean honestly this still has a really bullish look to it.
NEUT20|If the crypto market stays hot, but I think a break about that 10.2.
NEUT21|So the .102 level just realistically just the high of day today and where it just closed about 45 minutes ago.
BULL22|A break it out on volume probably sends this one back up to highs and then a break of that could realistically send this one up to like 11 to 12, maybe even $0.13 in the very short term.
NEUT23|So that would kind of be what I'd be looking at for both directions.
NEUT24|Right now it's a little bit hard to say 'cause they just started.
NEUT25|It's kind of hanging around in between.
NEUT26|You know that support level and right below the resistance level from the clothes, so I think those would be some of the levels I would be watching for so.
NEUT27|A break to the upside could send this one you know, pretty high, but you also gotta look at the support levels you want to see those holds in the short term.
NEUT28|You just want to see more higher lows so you have one low here, higher, low, high or low.
NEUT29|If this does pull back, you just want to see another higher low set up for another leg up or we want to see volume come in and send this one directly out for a break out.
