NEUT0|"""Mark Sebastian of Option Pit mentoring joins us now for the final trade of the day."
NEUT1|You have a plate in Disney ahead of earnings.
NEUT2|What are you seeing here?
NEUT3|Yeah, they so they have earnings, but more importantly they have The Avengers.
NEUT4|Avengers comes out at the end of April.
BEAR5|I'm expecting something to break all kinds of box office records.
NEUT6|You add that into the fact that they have another Star Wars and Frozen 2.
NEUT7|I know I'll be taking my wife to go see Frozen 2 and on top of that Disney.
NEUT8|Plus I think as Disney Plus starts to get closer and closer announcement you have this kind of swell of excitement.
BEAR9|And it's going to cause the stock to explode.
NEUT10|I can tell you, for instance, two days ago my son calls us to be complaining that one of the Star Wars cartoons he liked is no longer on Netflix, and I said, well, there's another reason for excitement around Disney.
NEUT11|The Disney Plus streaming service.
BULL12|Anna reason why I think Disney could easily break an all time high in the coming months.
NEUT13|Analysts love the stack, but as a trader and I tend to pay more attention to what the traders have to say, what would be the price target?
NEUT14|Or what would be of trade here?
BULL15|Alright, so the all time highs a little over 122 and it's just made a really good move up from about 108 up to about 1:17.
NEUT16|I like to basically kind of do the same thing.
NEUT17|Make a run at 125, maybe as high as 130 in.
NEUT18|Probably only a few weeks and then probably start spinning its wheels once it does that.
NEUT19|Major companies that are North of 200,000,000 billion market cap tend to move in fits and spurts.
BEAR20|I think it's going to spurt and I think it could.
BULL21|Easily pick up 15 to 20 billion market cap in a very short period of time.
NEUT22|Alright, so a trade would be like the stock as a buy.
NEUT23|Oh, or if I was interested in options, which as you know I'm an option Trader this option, but I like the July 120 calls.
NEUT24|They cost about $3.50 when Disney gets that 130 price point my calls will be up 4-5 X real nice ROI.
NEUT25|You hope I hope.
BULL26|Thanks for coming on the show.
BULL27|Thanks for having me.
NEUT28|Will stay tuned for that one.
