NEUT0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel in this video will be taking a look at Gevo."
NEUT1|I'll be going with daily price action that we saw today and just giving a daily update on the stock.
NEUT2|So stick around.
NEUT3|But before I get into the video, make sure to subscribe button.
NEUT4|Keep up the daily videos and check out the links in description to join the Patreon and Discord looking at the stock on the day the stock was about 18% on the day to close at $10.01.
BEAR5|The low on the day was $8.25 and currently as the recording this gebos at $9.90 in the after hours down about 1% overall.
BULL6|Today, the stock rose steadily throughout the day and then right before close we had a pretty big jump.
NEUT7|The brain is over $10 and this pretty big jump right at the end was likely due to the options expiring today.
NEUT8|As we know in a lot of talk for the last few days about the whole quadruple Witching Day, which if you're new to investing in, aren't familiar with this term pretty much summed up.
NEUT9|This happens four times a year and just simply putting it.
NEUT10|It's a day when there's a lot of volatility.
BEAR11|In the market, because there's a lot of options expiring, so overall if you look at the previous four days of this happened, there wasn't a clear positive or negative effect on the market which a lot of people seem to be worried about today.
NEUT12|Really, it's just a lot of extra volatility, so you'll see stocks move up and down pretty quickly.
BULL13|Overall it was good to see a good amount of green returned to the market, and the week I have high hopes for next week to see some more consistent green days.
NEUT14|Now I do get some questions about price predictions for the stock going forward, so here's how I see it.
BULL15|I think we'll be seeing more consistent green days in the coming weeks, and I'd look for Gmail to follow the overall market recovery.
BULL16|However, I do expect you would possibly recover just a little bit slower than the rest of the market, and this is just because we do have a while before any big things start happening for the company.
BEAR17|However, we could get some new contracts that could pump the stock up in the short term, but overall I do see this as a long term play from here and this isn't a bad thing at all because I think long term this is a really good play in my opinion, but will have to be patient, wait for the engineering work to be completed so we get the construction down at 0.1.
BULL18|Even get some actual production and cash flow coming in.
NEUT19|So personally I am holding quite a few shares and I'm holding these long term, but recently I have bought some just a few shares on these recent dips, but mainly on the recent dips in the past week I've been buying some longer term option calls.
NEUT20|Now I'm assuming most of us that are in jail or holding for the long term and the short term price movements are kind of irrelevant since we're holding long term.
NEUT21|However, I do still like to give short term price predictions for those who swing, trade it or just curious overall.
BULL22|So next week I think we'll see the tech sector start to gain some more momentum in its recovery.
NEUT23|Because we know Tech isn't going anywhere and it's here to stay.
BEAR24|And some of these companies are just dirt cheap right now.
NEUT25|As far as Gevo for next week.
BULL26|I do think there's a good chance that we could see Gevo closed next Friday at $11.50, if not a little bit higher than that.
BULL27|Now, I definitely think patience is going to be needed for a while with this stock, but I think the way we're really pay off as the year progresses and we get updates on the engineering work and the plant construction along with new contracts that we get throughout the year.
NEUT28|So as far as my long term price target, I did update just a little bit after the recent financials, and the Fireside Chat.
NEUT29|And I changed it from $50 to $40.
BULL30|So as I said, the previous price target was $50.00 for me and I still do believe we could be well over $50 by the end of the year.
NEUT31|But the engineering work in the construction that zero plants is going to take a little little bit like slightly longer than I was expecting, so I did change the target from 50 to 40 for me, but this isn't a bad thing.
BULL32|However, 'cause there's still huge gains to be made going forward in a few years.
NEUT33|There's no doubt in my mind that will be at least $100 or a couple $100 by that point, but I guess time will tell on that one, but what do you guys think about Jibo as far as price predictions?
NEUT34|"Let me know your price predictions for next week as well As for the end of the year down below in the comments and as always, just remember this video isn't financial advice, it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
