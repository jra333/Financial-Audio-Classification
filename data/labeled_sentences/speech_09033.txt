NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|We're not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, not the greatest week on this one.
BEAR5|I mean, it was just lower high after lower high.
BEAR6|I mean, every single time the price bounced, the highs just kept getting lower and lower.
NEUT7|Now that doesn't mean that the entire chart as a whole is totally destroyed.
BEAR8|An Apple is going bankrupt.
NEUT9|I'm not saying that at all.
NEUT10|I'm just saying that from a technical standpoint, in the near term, just a rough overall week and this trend line here that red dotted line up there.
NEUT11|I'm talking about that in past several videos and it's still 100% pertains to the chart.
NEUT12|It's not really close at all in terms of you know being threatened, but that still and I'm going to leave that in place, just more so out of curiosity sake will say we'll see how that red line plays out overtime.
NEUT13|But really, even before you focus on the overall trend line, the level Now that's presented a big problem which isn't shocking at all, is that purple line there, which is on my chart denoting the very well known.
NEUT14|The very famous 50.
NEUT15|Moving average.
NEUT16|You can see that the price.
NEUT17|Struggle to get above it right there, then try to bounce up.
NEUT18|Failed to break above it right there and then from there.
NEUT19|That's where the bigger plunge came and then right there bounce upward I guess kinda got close.
NEUT20|Not really at that point, but what I'm trying to get across there is yes this overall trend line here.
NEUT21|Resistance is definitely a key area of resistance, but before you even put any sort of focus or attention on it, the price first needs to prove itself by just getting up above and staying above that purple line.
NEUT22|Initially.
NEUT23|As far as levels of support of concern going to go ahead and get rid of that line there, because we'll just go and keep this very straightforward and clean.
NEUT24|In terms of not having much aligns and clutter everywhere, the main level of support now moving forward is that pink line right there, which on my chart denotes the very well known very famous 200.
NEUT25|Moving average, and that's currently about it will just call it the 117 mark.
NEUT26|So keep a close eye on 117.
NEUT27|That will definitely be a very important level to watch moving into next week, but yeah, rough week for Apple and especially the back half of the week, it was just lower high after lower high, but we'll see if the price and try to get things turned around or not next week.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.

NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT34|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
