BULL0|"""The excitement about Miami leads me to believe that it's the number one brand in the world right now."
NEUT1|Since I arrived 12 years ago to Miami to Miami of today.
NEUT2|You know, it's night and day.
NEUT3|You know, if I ask everybody here in the room to raise their hand and tell me how many have a grand father here that was born in Miami, I'm going not going to see one hand.
NEUT4|So we are all and you knew breed of people that are forming the city.
NEUT5|Miami can compete with any city and offering much more that only beautiful beaches and everything.
NEUT6|There is a movement.
NEUT7|I know there's some people have compared Miami to the next New York Miami World Center.
NEUT8|It's probably the largest mixed use project in the United States.
NEUT9|That's going in Miami, and that's going to be kind of like Times Square for New York.
NEUT10|You can say that here.
NEUT11|Maybe every culture in every country that you want.
NEUT12|What I feel happening is that this international market is really.
NEUT13|More of a local market and so everybody in South America is at least been to Miami once or twice, so at some point my knee makes him feel at home.
NEUT14|I will say 80% of the buyer are from South America and I'm very happy that South America existing because otherwise we don't have any sales in Miami.
NEUT15|I would say that there is not a more diverse place on Earth than what we have right here in Miami.
NEUT16|We really believe that you know world class City needs to have world class institutions and the Business School.
NEUT17|For example right now is.
BULL18|25% international students across the board, which is which is an insane number for US school.
NEUT19|There's no other US research University that's anywhere close to that.
NEUT20|One of the largest transitions of wealth in this country is moving from cities like New York and Los Angeles into South Florida.
NEUT21|Because not only do we have the best weather in the world, arguably, I think we do, but we also now have all of the other elements of a successful home, whether it be the incredible educational institutions, the medical institutions, the theater, the culture, the arts, the people.
NEUT22|You know I was mayor in Orlando an when I travel and try to sell Orlando.
NEUT23|I would always be asked is that part of Miami?
NEUT24|Is that in Miami and so that kind of tells you the picture of what it's like really is that.
NEUT25|"But but what that tells you is that Miami is one of the great global cities."""
