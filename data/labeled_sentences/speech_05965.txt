NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel today.
NEUT2|I want to talk about Netflix stock and whether or not I think it's a good buy so.
BULL3|Right off the bat you can see that Netflix has increased 294% in the last five years and part of that growth is because they transition from.
NEUT4|Kind of publishing other people's movies and videos on their platform to producing their own original series.
NEUT5|That was the turning point for Netflix.
NEUT6|That's when we saw Netflix kind of take off.
NEUT7|So Netflix is part of the thing.
NEUT8|And as you guys know, if you look at my other videos, I own all the fans but Netflix and let me tell you the reason why.
NEUT9|So.
NEUT10|I think about all the times that I use the other stocks that I own, so Microsoft I use Microsoft product everyday.
NEUT11|Google everyday Facebook everyday, Amazon occasionally, maybe four times a month to buy it something on their website.
NEUT12|I use square every day.
NEUT13|I don't own a Tesla, but Tesla is the future and I will own it in the future.
NEUT14|But when we look at Netflix, the problem that we see here is.
NEUT15|In terms of me, I don't really use Netflix that often.
NEUT16|I had it when I was in college.
NEUT17|You know, I don't think that it was worth the money.
NEUT18|It's getting more expensive.
NEUT19|I like to buy stocks that I use and and I'm very familiar with but Netflix I feel as old that there may be very limited growth if I perhaps five years ago.
NEUT20|You know I'll be more interested in buying it, but I'm not interested in buying it because there's more better options out there.
BULL21|I think that it has already had a good run and I'm trying to figure out ways that Netflix can also get two one $1 trillion market cap.
NEUT22|And it's very hard to think of something, but again, they came out with their original series and that's what caused the stock to boom.
NEUT23|So you know, I may change my mind in the future, but again, when you look at something that's very innovative, like Tesla, you know you're literally sitting in a computer.
NEUT24|You know, I just urge people to go, you know, to a dealership and actually sit in the car and they will see how innovative that is.
NEUT25|I just don't see that with Netflix.
NEUT26|As of right now.
NEUT27|And if that changes, then I'll probably make another video that explains why I am going to buy Netflix.
BULL28|"But as of now, in my opinion, I don't think Netflix is a good buy at this price, so I hope you guys like and subscribe and see you in the next video."""
