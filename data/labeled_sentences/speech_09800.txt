NEUT0|"""Guys, I really think that this is it for GameStop."
BULL1|I am still optimistic about it and I think that there still could be a short squeeze similar to Volkswagen.
NEUT2|But man, it just does not look good for GameStop guys.
BEAR3|It's down 40% today.
BEAR4|That is tough yo.
NEUT5|What is up guys Steven from market craze here?
NEUT6|If you're new here on the channel, welcome to the channel.
NEUT7|If you're returning member, welcome back.
NEUT8|So today we are going to be talking about GameStop and GameStop.
BEAR9|Is really crashing and burning at the moment.
NEUT10|I'm still optimistic about the stock but as of right now it's sitting at $50.
NEUT11|I can't imagine how that deep value guys feeling being up thirty million one day and now probably only being at 4/5 million.
NEUT12|That's kind of insane to me guys.
NEUT13|So GameStop is one of the stocks that was pretty much manipulated by Wall Street.
NEUT14|They pretty much made the stocks crash because they said it was market manipulation even though Wall Street does market manipulation on a daily basis.
NEUT15|I'm not really sure how a bunch of people on Reddit talking about a stock is market manipulation, but you know, whatever beats me, I guess that's the thing about Wall Street guys.
NEUT16|Everyone wants to put logic into this and say well, eventually they're going to have to sell.
NEUT17|They can make up their own rules.
NEUT18|OK, they don't have to do anything.
NEUT19|That's what really ***** to see.
BEAR20|Is this stock probably would have gone to 1000 if they just let the hype keep going, but obviously they didn't want to do that because that would have been messing with their pockets.
NEUT21|I'm going to be honest whenever I say this.
NEUT22|I think that GameStop is going to hit $28.00 tomorrow.
NEUT23|I seriously do.
NEUT24|I see GameStop doing in after hours, probably around 48, five, two, maybe, maybe 50, but right now we're actually sitting on it.
BEAR25|We're actually sitting on $453, so it honestly could hit 40.
NEUT26|I'm not sure it could just sit at 40 and after hours in an absolutely destroy the market tomorrow, an hit 20s.
BEAR27|I'm really hoping not, but I can honestly see that I was really hopeful with GameStop is as much as other people were as well, but GameStop is just a terrible investment to have in the long term.
NEUT28|Unlike a lot of these other ones that you know, read it pumped up.
BEAR29|GameStop was being shorted for a reason because it was going into bankruptcy in these big time.
NEUT30|Stockbrokers and hedge funds and big time billionaires and knew that they knew that they were going to go into bankruptcy and they took advantage of it.
NEUT31|And right now, they're about to win, but I would like to see what you guys think about GameStop in the comment section below.
NEUT32|Do you guys think that GameStop has a chance?
NEUT33|Do you think GameStop could actually come back and explode?
NEUT34|I would love to be proven wrong anyway.
BULL35|Hope you guys did smash that subscribe Smash.
NEUT36|That like maybe even turn on post notifications if you want to stay updated with every single stock video that I uploaded an I upload these daily.
BULL37|"Anyway guys hope you guys have a great rest of your day peace."""
