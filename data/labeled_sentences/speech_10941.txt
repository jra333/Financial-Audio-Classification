NEUT0|"""Joining me now is Robbie Salagram, a President and CEO of Newell Brands, which owns some of the biggest consumer names including Coleman Rubbermaid Sharpie, Paper Mate, Elmers Glue, a lot of brands."
BULL1|Robbie, thanks for being with me.
NEUT2|First of all, how has the?
NEUT3|I don't know if you want to call it a lack of back to school season, or just a shift in and how it's operated?
NEUT4|How is that affected you?
BULL5|Hi John, pleasure to be back on CNBC.
NEUT6|And yeah, definitely writing or writing business is very important business for us.
BEAR7|And this time the back to school season has got elongated and so we didn't see the surge that you normally would in July, August.
BULL8|But we yeah we've seen actually consumption started picking up in September and even through October and there are pockets of that business that are doing well are pen business.
BULL9|We just launched a great innovation.
BULL10|In fact, right here, my sharpies gel in pens market shares up 900 points in the gel segment, and up in Pence as a whole our dymo business, which is labeling and a lot of small businesses, are using dymo, and that is surging rather well.
NEUT11|So I think while there has been some softness but look, the important thing is that the newer portfolio, the diversity of the portfolio.
BULL12|Help us weather this and we actually delivered 727 point 2% core sales growth.
BULL13|Think of that's organic sales growth versus prior year and what's important John, is that the seven point 2% first time since 2017.
NEUT14|Pretty incredible, but that is pretty incredible and my big question for you has to do with the direct relationship with the consumer because I can't think of any stronger brands that in today's economy that don't.
NEUT15|Have, to my knowledge, much of a direct relationship.
NEUT16|You've worked very well with partners over the years, but a lot of strong brands these days are trying to go direct.
NEUT17|I can imagine subscriptions to Rubber Maid to Sunbeam.
NEUT18|Things like that.
NEUT19|Is that something that you've thought about, or are you sticking with your partners to maintain that relationship?
BULL20|So John, great question and lock our whole thing is about being Omni channel and so clearly we enjoy a fantastic partnership with our retail partners are mass business and our e-commerce business up dramatically.
BULL21|I think I said on our earnings call our E Commerce business yet today Dan in third quarter up about 40%.
BULL22|But what's more that our penetration of net sales reached 21% John?
BULL23|21% double that of 2018, so online becoming very important.
NEUT24|We're translating that more directly to your question.
NEUT25|We do have pockets where we go direct.
NEUT26|We have a director consumer business which is Yankee Candle, so great business on Yankee Candle.
BEAR27|And in fact, having that business helped us in the second quarter when all our retail stores were closed for Yankee Candle and that business made up half of the decline.
NEUT28|Off the retail business.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
