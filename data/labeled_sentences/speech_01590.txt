NEUT4|I make one new video every day to help you become a better investor by the 4th floor just by a tech company in the world of the Amgen, Gilead, and Celgene, it is focused on the neuroscience.
NEUT5|The company was founded in 1978 by a group of scientists to, or which Philip Allen Shop and Walter Gilbert won the Nobel Prize.
NEUT6|Right now, they're focusing on making drugs for patients with multiple sclerosis.
BEAR7|Parkinson's disease, as I move and 33% of their revenues come from TECFIDERA and 18% come from in different, so the company lost 30% of its market value on any day because one of his drugs that it has been developing cold and you can Bob Fair clinical trials.
NEUT8|So actually 99% of all the Eisenberg drugs they failed clinical trials.
NEUT9|So it's not something that should worry us in the long term.
NEUT10|But in the short term, yes, this can worry us because there.
BEAR11|Their patents on the existing drugs, of course, are going to expire in the coming years and they will have to find new drugs, and competitors are already gaining the market share, so that's why most horribly the news was taken so badly by the market.
NEUT12|Now let's have a look at the fundamentals.
NEUT13|the PE ratio is 10.87, The PROSPER book 3.55 then returns on asset is 16.28% very turns on equity 34.91%.
BULL14|The profit margin 32.9.
BEAR15|Super sad that we actually did.
NEUT16|It shows the report 4-5 and their current ratio is a 2.32.
BULL17|The fundamentals look great for the company and if you look at the company how it has been going over the last years, the revenue the net income, the operating income, the free cash flow operation Castro everything has been increasing to the company is doing great.
BEAR18|But of course this is bad.
BEAR19|News has led to the market overreacting on it.
NEUT20|I made by calculations Freaky Friday agreement about 20% per year.
BULL21|Over the last four years, let's actually worst case scenario, the free cash flow grows by only 5% per year event, then other correct price seems to be a good investment.
NEUT22|So most probably I'm going to invest in this company in the coming months.
NEUT23|Of course I need to do a little extra research to do a little extra research, not only on the main competitors, but also on the smaller competitors to know if realistic and after the market share should be considered.
NEUT24|Only the Big Four by a tech companies, Amgen, Celgene.
BULL25|Yeah, then Biogen Biogen is the best investment.
NEUT26|Other connect price and you should also consider the future because more and more people now will get their Parkinson disease as as heimer and other related diseases.
NEUT27|Because people are living longer and longer.
