NEUT0|"""To nest."
NEUT1|Or not to nest?
NEUT2|Is that really the question?
BEAR3|This is a tricky moment.
BULL4|The stock market had an enormous run from the bottom without any another 4 and 76 points ASAP.
BULL5|Jumping 1.39%.
BULL6|NASDAQ climbing 1.56%.
BEAR7|The vaccine situation is still fluid and we don't know when we'll be able to safely reopen.
NEUT8|Why does this matter?
NEUT9|Because the nesting stocks.
BEAR10|That's what we call them are starting to falter.
NEUT11|World itching to get out once safe to travel again, that the whole segment of the economy is going to catch fire the same way the roaring 20s followed the Spanish flu pandemic.
NEUT12|So suddenly people want to invest in the reopening stocks.
NEUT13|An yes they want to also.
NEUT14|The stocks that are involved with nesting at home.
NEUT15|I think that may be a mistake to simple at the end of day companies are not static piece that includes both the nesting place and to be open place.
NEUT16|They're not sitting there saying, oh, let's make some hay when the sun shines, but then we're going to be big losers.
BULL17|Their CEO's are taking action to ensure they come out of this crisis in better shape than they came in.
NEUT18|Which means their stocks aren't necessarily sales.
NEUT19|So let me give you some examples of both the reopening plays in the nasty names.
NEUT20|No, I'm talking bout anyone who's watching should have been recommending Disney in bowling for months.
NEUT21|Why?
NEUT22|Because their household names that will make a killing once we beat Covid going to Disney World.
NEUT23|Is it all merican vacation is practically a writer set up.
NEUT24|I almost said Richard massage like I'm some fancy French guy rite of passage I've been over at doesn't cause I've been to Disney World in.
NEUT25|Always going by playing it.
BEAR26|Usually at Boeing both companies have been hard hit by the pandemic.
NEUT27|This he makes movies where people are calling movies.
NEUT28|They have cruises.
NEUT29|People are crazy.
BEAR30|They have sports channel sports were canceled.
NEUT31|They have theme parks.
NEUT32|They can't make money without big crowds at a time when crowds are super spreader events.
NEUT33|As for Boeing, I mean, who the heck wants to buy airplanes when nobody's flying?
NEUT34|So did they just sit there and take a beating?
NEUT35|No, the opposite.
BULL36|Both companies adapted Disney double down on their new streaming service Disney Plus, to reach viewers stuck at home.
BULL37|Wow, what a home run.
NEUT38|It basically became the ultimate nesting stock, but you never forget what could become once the country reopens.
BULL39|Meanwhile, management cut costs aggressively and that that's going to mean that the margins are going to explode higher when things go back to normal.
NEUT40|That's what those big hotshot Wall Street guys really love now that that's why Disney stock is up huge today, sooner or later we know the world will reopen and Disney will be ready to Nestor naughtiness.
NEUT41|It's barely the question.
