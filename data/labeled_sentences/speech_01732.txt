NEUT1|This is Harold with World TV on demand.com.
NEUT2|Check out my website.
NEUT3|Hey Warren Buffett just bought back a billion dollars in buybacks of his own stock.
NEUT4|Because everything keeps getting sold off.
NEUT5|So I'm not telling you to buy, sell, or trade any stock, but you need to be talking to your stock broker.
BEAR6|'cause today the stock market is down again right now is down 321 while making this video.
BEAR7|But it was down.
NEUT8|Four 500 points earlier today.
NEUT9|And that means.
NEUT10|From the last couple of weeks.
BEAR11|The Dow Jones has lost like 2000 points, it might have gained and went up and down just a little bit, but as you can see from the chart, it's almost 26,000 and now we're 24,000 and it's been lower than what it is right now.
NEUT12|So all these buybacks is not helping the stock market, and you need to be paying attention.
NEUT13|I don't know if this is true or not, but look at the stock market for Netflix.
NEUT14|I mean, they've been buying back 175,000,000 a 108, million, 149 million buyback, 57 million, fifty one million.
NEUT15|I mean, they've been hundreds of millions of dollars by back in their own stock to prop up their stock.
NEUT16|And people keep selling it and they keep buying it back.
NEUT17|So I mean you gotta be careful with all this going on.
NEUT18|This is a fake market.
NEUT19|And Warren Buffett is right up there with the top dogs.
NEUT20|If he's not the top dog, I don't know who he is.
NEUT21|But when your stock goes down in the Dow Jones goes down, and a billionaire like Warren Buffett buys a billion dollars buyback of billion dollars.
BEAR22|People you gotta be paying attention because something's wrong with the stock market.
NEUT23|It cannot stay where it's at.
BULL24|So this is Harold with World TV on demand.com bringing a great video.
NEUT25|Make sure you call your broker check on your stock.
NEUT26|Make sure that you have a stop on your stock so you don't lose it all.
NEUT27|So give me a thumbs up.
NEUT28|Subscribe to the video and I have another one for you soon.
BULL29|"You guys have a great day."""
