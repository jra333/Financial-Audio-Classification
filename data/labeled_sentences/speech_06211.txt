NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, quite the eventful day here on Amazon.
BEAR5|Things were not looking so good.
BEAR6|I mean, don't get me wrong, it was still a rough day.
BEAR7|I mean, there was actually a gap up to think that some poor souls were buying up here and then had the price just completely collapse down below there.
NEUT8|But it makes this interesting.
BULL9|Is that the price has now started to work its way upwards.
NEUT10|The question becomes oh, and what I just drew here so between.
NEUT11|The circle is what is known as a bear flag.
NEUT12|Now, just because there is a bearish pattern does not mean that for sure guaranteed the price is going downwards.
NEUT13|No such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT14|All I'm saying is I get it.
NEUT15|There's been some nice upward movement right here, but I'd be a little bit skeptical of it until the price can really prove that it's actually strong, which brings about the next question, which is more than valid clay.
NEUT16|Well, how are you defining?
NEUT17|Prove like how can the price prove itself and that is where this red line here comes into play, which I've talked about previously, right up here.
BULL18|Around the 3050 mark mean can the price not only get up to 3050 but then start to show some signs of wear.
NEUT19|The price stays up above it now, even if that occurs, does not mean that for sure.
NEUT20|Guaranteed this thing is going to reverse itself around, but at that point it gives a little bit more sustainability.
NEUT21|That, OK, yeah, maybe this bear flag wasn't actually a bearish pattern 'cause that bear Flag is, you know, completely been destroyed right now, and you know that's where the 3050 mark comes into play.
NEUT22|So yes, right now it is bouncing, but it has formed that bear Flag, so it's really just a question of can that bear flag be destroyed?
NEUT23|And again.
BULL24|Quote Unquote, The destroying part being up above 3050.
NEUT25|I'm going to go ahead and adjust this level of support downwards here of 2950.
NEUT26|Mean if the price rolls back over and breaks through 2950 at that point that would be confirmation that not only has the bearish pattern played out, but now they would have to be.
NEUT27|You know, you know, that much more focused on OK, well, how much more of continuation is this thing going to get?
NEUT28|So that's going to be very important level right there also.
NEUT29|But as of right now, interesting setup moving forward.
NEUT30|So let's say it continues to play out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT32|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT37|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT41|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT44|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT45|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
