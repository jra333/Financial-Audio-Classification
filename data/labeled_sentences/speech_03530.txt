BULL1|You can see that we rallied here to reach towards the 50 day Ma and we clearly have seen this area act as a little bit of a barrier to me.
NEUT2|I think we're probably going to roll over, but I'm not selling gold.
NEUT3|I'm looking to pay attention to 1850 and most certainly 1800 hours potential buying opportunities.
NEUT4|There was a lot of noise and nonsense involving the Brexit during the day, so that caused the US dollar to jump around, so I would not read too much into the candle.
BEAR5|"Other than the fact that we are at the $1900 level, an area that seems to be a bit of a fulcrum for price."""
