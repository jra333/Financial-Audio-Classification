NEUT0|"""I don't know if I'm going to get answers to this one, but the second question is your asset allocation."
NEUT1|What are you in?
NEUT2|If you won't give us percentages anyway, that's the question.
NEUT3|I have a global index fund it all in expenses or 8 basis points.
NEUT4|8 basis points, all in expense.
NEUT5|That's a very small amount for a total expense, and to get a world portfolio.
NEUT6|And so I have that I have tips.
NEUT7|As you know, I've got one hedge fund until eight months ago I had commercial real estate.
NEUT8|I might as well disclose that it was TA real estate fund, which I went into for reasons and I just got very nervous because the real estate fund was kind of going up every day.
NEUT9|Like a bank account?
NEUT10|I mean it was except with a very nice interest rate.
NEUT11|An I think that's valued on the basis of appraisals, so I just got nervous that maybe.
NEUT12|Mark to market.
NEUT13|Might be a good thing to be aware of in times when you're not sure, so that's why I got out of commercial real estate.
NEUT14|I had some initial bonds.
NEUT15|Oh yeah, that was another one I said.
NEUT16|Well, I've got Massachusetts municipal bonds, and I know Massachusetts not going to go broke.
BEAR17|Well, any case as we know the Miss Palletes are great deal of trouble.
NEUT18|I don't know what bankruptcy law is for municipalities, but I worry that.
NEUT19|They're going to see the only way out is what the airlines took.
NEUT20|And aside, the only way to get out of the labor contracts is to go bankrupt.
NEUT21|Bob you're asking the wrong question of of me, but I have never paid any attention.
NEUT22|If you ask me what whatever assets I have, what the allocation is now, I only honest answer I could give you as I haven't the vaguest idea.
NEUT23|And if you had asked me that question at anytime in the past 60 years, I could have given you exactly the same answer except at the.
NEUT24|There must have been a point in time when I had zero assets and then I knew perfectly well.
NEUT25|But then of course it didn't matter.
NEUT26|Your asset allocation, no comment.
NEUT27|Your suggested asset allocation is still fifty 2525.
NEUT28|Well, I'll tell you the most important question that vexes the minds.
NEUT29|Of people like me on the Finance Committee of the National Academy of Sciences is the following.
NEUT30|The evidence is overwhelming.
NEUT31|That 1000 timers try to buy.
NEUT32|When stocks are low and sell when they're high.
BEAR33|Is a damnably awful record.
NEUT34|And it isn't so hard to sell, but you don't know when to get back in and typically things move very very fast in normal cycles when they when they go back.
NEUT35|What should you think?
NEUT36|When somebody as wise as Alan Greenspan.
NEUT37|Says this is a once in a.
NEUT38|Century.
NEUT39|Event.
NEUT40|Should you still in that case?
NEUT41|Taking no sale at all.
NEUT42|And that's a very hard.
NEUT43|"Decision."""
