NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's November 18th, 2016.
NEUT2|I'm Celina, Nicholas technical analyst at xm.com.
NEUT3|Today we'll look at the euro versus the British pound.
NEUT4|We're looking at the daily chart.
BEAR5|Euro GBP continues to weaken after the drop below the 200 day moving average on November 11th and we saw prices consolidating below this level now, which is acting as resistance.
NEUT6|We look at momentum indicators, RSI, mcdi there.
BEAR7|Hi there, negative and basically highlighting the bearish market structure in the short term.
BULL8|But with our site now close at oversold levels, this suggests that market could consolidate at current levels and find support around point 8530 and the new term.
BULL9|We could say this is important support.
NEUT10|It's actually a fibbonaci level.
BULL11|It's a 78.6 foot Minacci retracement level of the September to October rise from point 8332.
BULL12|Up two point 9261.
BEAR13|Sustained trading below the key level of 0.87 will likely maintain a bearish bias.
NEUT14|Immediate support is at 8420 if price is support does not hold it point 8530.
BEAR15|Now this point 8420 level has been tested several times back in September, so it's considered to be a strong support level, but a further decline from here would target the low of Point Lady 332 that was reached back in September on September 6.
NEUT16|And from current levels, if there's a bounce higher immediate resistance, like I said would be the 200 day moving average at point 8633.
BEAR17|Above this, the key psychological level will zero.
BULL18|Point 8700 is next resistance, but the market would need to rise back above point 8880 to shift the bias back to more bullish one.
BULL19|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL20|"Have a great day."""
