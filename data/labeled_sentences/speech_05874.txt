BULL0|"""Well, those laser eyes have quite a target today 8000 on the S&P 500."
NEUT1|By the end of the decade, that's an alliance.
NEUT2|Bernstein is coming out with that.
NEUT3|First of all, that's quite a long term forecast that they're that they're looking at.
NEUT4|Says he break it down for us.
NEUT5|Yeah, I think I'll be almost 50 at that time, Julie.
NEUT6|But yes, a very interesting note out this morning here from the team and Allianz Bernstein of Indigo, Fraser, Jenkins and Alla Harmsworth really have to shout them out here looking at for looking at S&P 508 thousand over the next 8 1/2 years.
NEUT7|That's their new target out this morning and they're making that target because their current target of 4000 is about to be hit by the S&P 500 right now is hovering around there.
NEUT8|They point to two things in this extensive 16 page note for that potential.
NEUT9|Target of 8000 being 1 prospect for low yields.
NEUT10|I know a lot of focus right now is on rising yields.
NEUT11|This team says it's likely we could see low yield for the next 8 1/2 years, which could be a market tailwind that helps propel the S&P 500 to 8000 and the next, which is interesting too and we haven't talked much about it.
NEUT12|The lack of other appealing assets, you know, the Allianz Bernstein team calls this Tina, and we've heard this before, but they called.
NEUT13|They highlight Tina.
NEUT14|There is no other alternative, and just the fact that is.
BULL15|That stock could continue to be attractive investment for investors you know, because of more earnings power, low yields, potentially a long term runway for low or sustained low inflation.
BULL16|Here after the recovery, those could be key determinants in pushing the S&P 508 thousand from about 4000.
NEUT17|Now Julie and it may not be as far fetched as one might think.
NEUT18|You know I went back to.
NEUT19|I went on Yahoo Finance plus and I went back to where the market was on this day.
NEUT20|10 years ago.
NEUT21|SMP five hundred 1321 so it's possible.
NEUT22|It's possible, I mean, sure it's possible an if Miles ugland were here.
NEUT23|He would say docs tend to go up over time.
NEUT24|I just don't know what the upside is for a strategy team in putting that specific of a number on it.
NEUT25|But sure, if you're going to hold stocks over the long term.
NEUT26|They're probably going to go up collectively, but I do wonder, like what does that do for clients to say 8 thousands of number?
NEUT27|I think putting a target out like this and I go back to when I was an analyst.
NEUT28|You always try to tell folks my price target is for the next 12 to 24 months and this might be just the function of them trying to refocus investors get out of the short term mindset of the market.
BEAR29|All this daily volatility, especially now if you see a family office, get completely blown up here and Bill Wong.
NEUT30|Focus more on the longer term.
BULL31|Because if these models would say stocks tend to go up over the long term and over the next 8 1/2 years, the earnings power of corporate America is such.
NEUT32|You could very much see SMP 508 thousand.
NEUT33|Alright, I wonder if Miles is cheeks are burning right now.
NEUT34|"If he if he senses that were that we're quoting him frequently, hope hopefully he's a please not actually watching as he's off today."""
