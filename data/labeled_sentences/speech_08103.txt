NEUT0|"""What's up guys feeding information here."
NEUT1|So I did already make a video on Aurora.
NEUT2|Cannabis is earnings, but I just want to talk about something.
BULL3|I just want to get into a little bit of more detail, so they basically had a revenue increase year over year of 222%.
NEUT4|However, that's not really **** because they only got 19 million.
BEAR5|From the earnings did have them skyrocketing all the way up to about 10% up today.
BEAR6|Now they're falling down to 4%.
NEUT7|Product is more and more people are realizing, hey there, that overvalued.
BULL8|Even if Coca Cola is helping them out.
NEUT9|However, I want to talk about how we definitely almost certainly can know that they Coca Cola is after them.
NEUT10|Not a different Canadian pot company because they're not so much focused on marijuana.
NEUT11|So let's go ahead and read this real quick.
NEUT12|Scroll down a little bit.
NEUT13|OK, hold on.
NEUT14|Hemp and CBD, so CBD is different from him.
NEUT15|We're going to talk about what CBD is right here.
NEUT16|Coca Cola is interested in CBD, which is an ingredient that has been applied in medicine and Wellness.
NEUT17|It's in Epidiolex, a product by GW Pharma.
NEUT18|The cannabinoid can potentially be used to produce infused drinks that help muscle recovery, an relieve pain and soreness so.
NEUT19|Honestly, I would almost see that as something that would be a better version of a Gatorade or Powerade if it's Coca Cola then it would have to be Powerade, because Pepsi owns Gatorade, but athletes could use that instead of the regular drinks that are already out there.
NEUT20|They could have the CBD infused one, and the supplier could be Aurora cannabis, and that's basically where he's getting at, so Coca Cola could dominantly just get this product out there if it was approved and allowed to go out there.
NEUT21|And in this case, where it's not marijuana, it's not exactly any kind of supplement that comes from marijuana comes from just hemp.
BULL22|I do see it very likely to be passed, and I see it growing faster than consolation and cannabiz way if possible, because here in the US the consumer base just buys buys buys more than it does anywhere else in the world.
NEUT23|The other place, perhaps like China or something where it could be like crazy popular and those are actually two of Coca-cola's most dominant countries in terms of revenue.
NEUT24|So it's very likely that was just something I want to talk about.
BULL25|Those so definitely still hyped on Aurora.
NEUT26|However, I would need to see more out of it.
NEUT27|I need to see what Coca Cola's plans are, but that was just another update on my favorite marijuana stock Aurora Cannabis.
BULL28|"Thank you so much for watching feeding information out."""
