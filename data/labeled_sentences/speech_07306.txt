BEAR0|"""First quarter GDP came in as a little bit of a disappointment."
NEUT1|Kathleen Madigan is here to tell us about it.
NEUT2|What happened in the first quarter in the United States of America?
NEUT3|Kathleen Madigan, the entire nation 300,000,000 people.
BEAR4|Business spending really kind of hit the brakes.
BEAR5|It was very disappointing.
NEUT6|Consumers did their part.
BULL7|It was up.
BULL8|You know, spending up almost 3%.
BEAR9|Inventories added what was expected and that, to me, is a little worrisome because the danger is that stockpiling is getting ahead of demand now.
NEUT10|I mean, do those two things go together?
NEUT11|Stop growing inventories and rising consumer spending?
NEUT12|They can?
NEUT13|I mean, if businesses think that spending is going to continue to grow at that pace, then of course you want to have inventories in so that somebody walks through the door.
NEUT14|You have exactly what they want.
BEAR15|The danger is if you think that demand is going to keep going.
NEUT16|It doesn't go then all the sudden you've got all these goods on hand.
NEUT17|You stop ordering production lines, slow down.
NEUT18|And that's the word.
BEAR19|Layoffs layoffs.
NEUT20|Where are consumers getting the money?
NEUT21|That's what I'm more interested in.
NEUT22|You know we don't hear anything good about wage growth necessarily, right?
NEUT23|And because we got the employment cost index today at the same times, GDP, wages or one half one point 7%, and that's below inflation, you know there are other sources of income and savings, no, no investment.
BULL24|Dividend income is doing very well investment income, not so much.
BULL25|Thank you fed rental income.
BULL26|People who own rental properties because rents are going up, we're doing pretty well in farm.
BULL27|Income is doing well, but you're right.
BEAR28|Did we see a drawdown in savings?
NEUT29|Now?
BEAR30|We saw slower savings.
BULL31|Lower savings because you know, it's a.
NEUT32|It's a nuanced thing, but people are still saving.
BULL33|They're not really drawing down and, well, you know the stock market did well.
NEUT34|So people who hold a lot in stocks felt comfortable about cashing some of them in and spending that.
NEUT35|So put all that together.
NEUT36|You got first quarter GDP at 2.2%.
NEUT37|What does that mean for the second quarter?
NEUT38|We're looking at now?
NEUT39|Yeah, that's I.
NEUT40|You know this.
BEAR41|I've long said that this is an economy capable of only growing about 2 1/2% because of the drags that have happened from the past.
BULL42|If weather cooperates, maybe we'll get 2 1/2, but I think you know realistically another 2.2% because one of the big problems, even though seeing the enterprise landing and everyone's like, oh it, is very cool.
NEUT43|Very cool.
BEAR44|You know government spending is a drag on the economy, both state and local level, and depends spending really dropped in the first quarter and the audio.
NEUT45|The auto industry was a big contributor to the first quarter GDP.
NEUT46|What if that you know the demand that the pent up demand that's been there?
NEUT47|It doesn't.
NEUT48|Follow through, yeah, exactly yeah you're right.
NEUT49|It contributed almost half of the growth.
NEUT50|A lot of it was people actually did buy cars.
NEUT51|How much of that is now translating into inventories were going to get that weather effect.
NEUT52|It was good weather, so people went about cars.
NEUT53|Might wait until the spring, right?
NEUT54|Yeah, that's true.
NEUT55|Yeah, so we're going to see all that Add all that together.
NEUT56|What does it do for the stock market?
NEUT57|Not a lot.
BULL58|The Dow is up about 16 points.
NEUT59|SMPS basically flat, not.
NEUT60|You know Liz and they're not down, right?
BULL61|I mean, the market expected would be stronger.
BEAR62|GDP report, so you wouldn't be surprised the market was down, right?
BULL63|They go up 17.
NEUT64|Yeah, I mean you know this is a 2 1/2 economy is not going to give you a lot of profit growth.
NEUT65|Yeah right?
BEAR66|Alright jobs or add jobs right now, that's really.
NEUT67|That's what the bottom line is about all this.
BEAR68|So again, we're just kind of in this mire.
NEUT69|We can't get out of it.
NEUT70|That's it was somewhere between somewhere between stall speed and escape velocity, yet, so we can't not getting back to the whole flight again.
NEUT71|Getting back to the whole flight thing right there.
BEAR72|Sorry Kathleen Madigan.
BULL73|Thank you very much.
BULL74|"You're welcome."""
