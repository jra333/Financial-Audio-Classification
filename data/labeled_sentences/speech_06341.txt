BULL0|"""Here we come down the home stretch our final stock for this five stock sampler is the single best performer over the long term."
NEUT1|Among all of these companies, it's probably the most obscur as well.
NEUT2|The ticker symbol is TREX and sure enough, that's also the name of the company.
NEUT3|This is the outdoor decking company tracks and Rex just looking at recent history since that's our focus in this five stock sampler tracks.
BEAR4|Was at $89.00 a share on September 10th and today it's at 61 so tracks is down.
NEUT5|31% an yet I first recommended it in July of 2012.
NEUT6|So about six years ago at $6.77.
BEAR7|So you just heard me say it's dropped from 89 to 61, well from $6.77 to 61 has been outstanding.
BULL8|It's up over 830% since that pick and I guess it's worth mentioning here.
NEUT9|It's kind of fun to think about it.
NEUT10|Of all of these companies, many of which are very technology driven and are really creating platforms like the trade desk or you think about Teledoc and its technology.
NEUT11|Or two you bringing technology into classrooms or video games.
BULL12|One of the best technologies of our time.
BULL13|And yet the best performer among these is a composite outdoor decking company which is a reminder that great companies are all around us.
NEUT14|It's not always about the latest whizbang gadget, although I will say within its field tracks is the innovator.
BULL15|So this composite outdoor decking much superior to would I see this kind of decking in professional settings around Washington DC area?
NEUT16|This is like.
NEUT17|The stuff that doesn't get badly damaged by water and we've had more rain in Washington DC than any year I can remember.
NEUT18|Maybe in my lifetime is a lifetime DC resident so you gotta love Trex outdoor decking.
BULL19|It looks like wood but functions better and that's why you see that kind of outperformance A9 bagger over the last six years.
NEUT20|Usually there is going to be a great product or product experience at the heart of a winning stock like that.
NEUT21|In this case it has really nothing to do with the Internet, which is where so much.
NEUT22|Of our great performance often is in our kinds of companies, so I love how well checks is done and my two things that I love about tracks.
NEUT23|Well, one is that and this is consistent with some of the others.
NEUT24|But number one I re recommended it five years later.
NEUT25|So yes, I did mention our cost basis to earlier and how it's a 9 bagger, but in February of 2017 I was casting about for what stock to re recommend in Motley Fool Rule Breakers and I picked Rex again so back then it was at 33.
BULL26|So it's gone up 91%.
NEUT27|So what I love about this company is it's one of those companies.
NEUT28|It's still small.
NEUT29|It's got a $4 billion market cap.
BULL30|It's a leader in its field.
NEUT31|I only see more and more outdoor decking in the world's future.
NEUT32|As our population grows and people rebuild or build new, and so I really liked Rex is positioning.
NEUT33|Also, like its relative obscurity.
NEUT34|That's #2.
NEUT35|Many people have never heard of checks and would be shocked to think that you could find a stock like that.
BULL36|They would do that well in the service called Motley Fool Rule Breakers.
NEUT37|So sometimes you gotta love the more obscure companies Peter Lynch did a great job highlighting these kinds of companies in his classic One up.
NEUT38|"On Wall Street, companies that don't sound **** to Wall Street and don't make for exciting elevator pitches and yet look at that performance."""
