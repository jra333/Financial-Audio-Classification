NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this technical analysis video here."
NEUT1|Dixon.com it's Tuesday, September 3rd and today will be looking at pound dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|So having a look at the chart we can see that sellers returned to the market following a failing attempt to bridge the upper surface of these descending channel.
BEAR3|The price is currently around 2:00 and U 31 month lows is slightly below the key.
BEAR4|One point 1986 a barrier and it seems that the market is likely to keep negative momentum in the short term as the Mac D. History has strengthened back to the downside, crossing under its red signal line as well.
BEAR5|While the RSI is also in bearish mood, sloping downwards and towards is 30 oversold mark, so the decline continues.
NEUT6|The one point 19 psychological market keep traders busy before all attention turns to the bottom line of this descending triangle.
BEAR7|Currently seen around one point 18 the one point 17 level could also attract attention if the downfall gets deeper.
NEUT8|So what we should care about.
BEAR9|Significant violation of this channel because if the price drops under the lower border we may probably see more losses in the market.
BEAR10|Looking to the upside now there was a lot of noise between one point 21 and 1.22 recently and therefore the area will remain in focus if the price reverses higher.
BULL11|What would be more challenging, however, is a strong rally above the channel.
BULL12|In more importantly above, the 50 day moving average as such a move would likely strengthen buying.
BEAR13|Interest sending resistance up to 1.25 and one point 2578 Eve the one point 2380 obstacle is breached as well.
BEAR14|It's also worth mentioning that one point 2578 is currently viewed as a threshold for an outlook reversal in the medium term.
BEAR15|If the market improves above that level, the current bearish picture would shift back to neutral.
NEUT16|So that's all from me.
NEUT17|Thank you for watching.
BULL18|"Have a great day."""
