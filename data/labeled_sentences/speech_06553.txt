NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Thursday, May 11th.
NEUT2|I'm Celina necklace technical analyst.
NEUT3|Xm.com today will look at the New Zealand dollar versus U.S. dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR4|So the Kiwi dollar is bearish in the near term as downside pressure.
BULL5|Is clearly on the downside with scope to target 0.68 as a next support level, but downside momentum is not that strong.
BULL6|Based on we look at the Daily RSI there, so there is a possibility for the market to make a recovery or to consolidate at current levels.
BEAR7|Immediate resistance will be seen at the 50 day moving average at point 6967.
BULL8|That's close to the May 3rd high.
NEUT9|Above this, the key level at 0.70 will act as a strong barrier to upside moves and from here prices would target the 200 day moving average.
NEUT10|Currently at point 7120.
BEAR11|But for now the bearish stance would remain if the pair is unable to break resistance at point 6967 in the near term break below .68.
BEAR12|That's a key support level falling below.
BEAR13|This would accelerate it decline.
BEAR14|Towards the May 2016 low of point 6670.
BEAR15|But if we look at the medium term outlook, it's also looking bearish as indicated by the technicals maqdis below.
BEAR16|0 and our sites in bearish territory below 50 and the market is trading below the 50 day and the 200 day moving average, and we could see the market could be falling in a down.
BULL17|Downside channel thanks so much for watching.
BULL18|"Have a great day."""
