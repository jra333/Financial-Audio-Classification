BULL0|"""Hi and welcome to another podcast from The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|I'm Owen Banner lack from the Championship Pro service and I have here may know Peyton from The Motley Fool.
NEUT2|Easy Editor of Motley Fool website and something you may not know about.
NEUT3|Maynard is he is smarter than Warren Buffett.
NEUT4|May not ask the man who believes that Tesco shares are not cheap.
NEUT5|Most of us think they are Maynard.
NEUT6|What's what's your problem?
NEUT7|Tesco?
BEAR8|I think it could be dead money.
NEUT9|I've been looking at the supermarket sector.
BULL10|Recently a lot of people, as you say saying Tesco looks cheap P of 10 yield of 5%.
NEUT11|But I think in the sector itself right there isn't.
NEUT12|There's a cases from history where you look back and you think the shares look cheap but the the the supermarket just don't go anywhere and I think a bit of a value trap.
NEUT13|OK so could you give us a couple of examples.
BEAR14|So one example is across the channel in France Carrefour which has had a lot of problems recently.
NEUT15|Carrefour is the Tesco equivalent of France, similar soft size, similar sort of revenues.
BEAR16|Similar market position Neverless issued a profit warning in 2008.
NEUT17|Issued several warnings.
BEAR18|Since then, profits are foreign heavily since then and current forecasts are for the current year.
BEAR19|Carryforward profits going to be 50% down from what they were five years ago, and so as a dividend as well.
BEAR20|OK, that's that's grim.
NEUT21|Maynard, yeah, but their French who trust the French were gonna answer close to.
NEUT22|Well one answer is Sainsbury's and you must have heard of these.
NEUT23|You know these were the test goes of the H is.
BEAR24|Fantastic growth record in the 80s or sort of fell apart in the early 90s when the Sainsbury's family stepped back from running the company.
NEUT25|Anna Sainsbury's in 1993 actually made a £900 million operating profit and it's never since made a greater profit than that nearly 20 years.
BULL26|So last year it made £700 million profit it still to reach its 93 peak.
NEUT27|I mean certainly true that if you were getting 5% from Tesco for 20 years but the share price didn't go anywhere that wouldn't be the greatest investment would it?
NEUT28|No, no, I know you're a patient investor, Owen.
NEUT29|But 20 years of no growth stays with shares of trade between 3:15 four pounds for the last 1520 years.
NEUT30|Barring the orbit of speculative speculation, I mean the difference.
NEUT31|I would, I would argue with you without going to that into the weeds.
NEUT32|As our American cousin say about Tesco is Tesco is still the market leader where it Sainsbury's was on back foot.
NEUT33|Let's well says was the market leader in the 80s and it just lost its way with the test code is still the market is still still the market leader.
NEUT34|Things can change you got.
NEUT35|You got Sainsbury's Morrisons Asda, Walmart or powerful competitors and you know the history or at least Carrefour and Sainsbury's is, you know could be.
NEUT36|Tesco takes a long time to turn around.
NEUT37|I see supermarket super tankers OK with that sort of in the Atlantic.
NEUT38|Those sort of large turning circles could take a long time.
NEUT39|Years I think it could take turn around So what what does Warren Buffett see that you don't see?
NEUT40|Or is he wrong?
NEUT41|I think you might be wrong.
NEUT42|Tesco Tesco.
NEUT43|He bought Tesco in 2006.
NEUT44|£3.00 I reckon about £3.33 and always have since is dividends which is fine but you know six years without capital gain.
BEAR45|People celebrate his boss and more, but I think he's sitting on a loss since then.
NEUT46|And remember, it's only a fraction of his common stock portfolio.
NEUT47|Maybe one percent 2% of what he owns in Tesco, so it's a bit of a opponent to search.
NEUT48|So Aaron see players really want some money out.
NEUT49|Yeah, maybe, but the fact is he lives in Nebraska is a little nowhere and you think he knows a lot about Tesco stores in the UK.
NEUT50|I'm not so sure.
NEUT51|Probably not OK. Well, there you have a Tesco shares.
NEUT52|Possibly not a bargain.
NEUT53|According to Maynard Arboga.
NEUT54|"According to Warren Buffett will see."""
