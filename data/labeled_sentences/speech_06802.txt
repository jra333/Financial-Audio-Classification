NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol TSLA Tesla."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, quite the eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|Big price movement, big volume.
NEUT6|Although I will say that from the presentation standpoint, a very tricky chart to talk about.
NEUT7|'cause there's a lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT8|What do I mean by that?
NEUT9|Well, if you're some sort of daytrader, flipper, scalp or whatever, want to call yourself and you were buying up here in your plan was to buy in South in 25 minutes.
BEAR10|Well, then from that perspective the chart looks really really bad.
NEUT11|Now if you care about things from the bigger picture point of view.
BULL12|Then yeah, I understand the price did pull back.
NEUT13|However, again from the grand scheme of it all, the price does still have plenty of up to chip away and build a higher base, and that's how long term uptrends are constructed is higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time, and that's going to be the viewpoint that I talked about things from.
NEUT14|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had more of a charter type mentality going into this, and I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake, let's say the price pulls back some more.
NEUT15|And comes down there to 6:55.
NEUT16|So price comes down here to 6:55 and then you know behave like that in search of curl itself.
NEUT17|Back upwards now.
NEUT18|Emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT19|What would you have while you have a set of those there you have Lowe's there.
NEUT20|You'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT21|You'd have Lowe's down there and if you envision each one of those is there steps, what do you have?
NEUT22|Well, from the big picture, you would still very clearly have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT23|And again, that's the name of the game.
BULL24|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT25|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined.
NEUT26|At 6:55 again I fully understand if you are a day trader and you bought right there, you don't care about these stair steps.
NEUT27|That's why I try to offer a warning that I would be coming on things from the bigger picture point of view.
BULL28|So yet today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today as in one day looking at multiple days as we're doing here, you can see the price does still have plenty of opportunity to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT29|So let's see if the price can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT40|That is, again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
