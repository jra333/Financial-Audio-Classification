NEUT0|"""Alex, I do slightly wonder whether the Doge coin."
NEUT1|From must point of view, is a bit of a joke.
NEUT2|He's kind of alluded to the fact that it is and has really said is coming to collective group that's backing it.
NEUT3|My real question this morning is the penultimate story there.
NEUT4|Which was Tesla?
NEUT5|Yeah, the use case obviously is really important because you can get a use case for Bitcoin, but I do slightly wonder.
BULL6|I Elon Musk has been a key driver for Bitcoin to excuse the part over the last few days and weeks.
NEUT7|Now it's investing, I'd like to know what what their entry point was here.
NEUT8|Well, sure, but you know that's serious finance.
NEUT9|I want to know if you knew how to say Doge coin before the 25 year olds on our staff told us and tutored us in the middle of the break, did you?
NEUT10|I did not.
NEUT11|No idea, no idea to your point though, and if you know what when they got into Bitcoin, etc.
NEUT12|I'm also interested in paying for a car with Bitcoin.
NEUT13|Anecdotally, I have a God daughter who's 27 and she wanted to buy an apartment with Bitcoin as down payment and the broker looked at her like she was insane.
NEUT14|I think that conversation is going to happen really quickly, and Tesla and buying that is just a part of it.
BULL15|Yeah, I, I think this will only further spur central banks into digital currencies.
NEUT16|I it's already a conversation that starting the more this gains traction and then there's a use case then it really gives it traction as well.
NEUT17|They're gonna have to.
NEUT18|"They're going to have to have everyone else is."""
