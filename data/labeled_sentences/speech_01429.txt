NEUT0|"""Hey, good morning Bob trade genius here the 4th of October."
NEUT1|Just want to show you one chart.
NEUT2|Partially to charge, but it's the same thing.
NEUT3|And.
NEUT4|I cleaned up all my indicators just to show you the.
NEUT5|The price action.
NEUT6|And this is the NASDAQ.
NEUT7|And this is the febrile trace Minton from.
BULL8|It's recent high too.
NEUT9|This little double bottom here it put in.
NEUT10|And the thing of note here is on Friday.
NEUT11|Just when the news on Trump came out.
BEAR12|Hit 50% retracement and rolled over and that's that's bearish.
NEUT13|And so now the expectation is is.
BEAR14|We have a. Retrace potentially down to 9580 area here.
NEUT15|OK, one 9492 to be exact.
NEUT16|It said something to keep an eye on, you know, on the bullish side though, which I'm not really sure yet.
NEUT17|It's in the shoulder.
NEUT18|Here's ahead.
NEUT19|Is it going to format other shoulder?
NEUT20|I don't know.
NEUT21|But just something to keep an eye on.
NEUT22|But I wouldn't be bullish on.
NEUT23|The NASDAQ listed breaks back over.
NEUT24|This 50% area and then make a race for the.
BULL25|The highs again, so right now it's an approved me.
NEUT26|Situation and then let me show you from the Q standpoint.
NEUT27|You don't have the overnight action, so here's a bigger picture here.
NEUT28|Of.
BEAR29|The NASDAQ from the March lows.
NEUT30|All the way to.
BULL31|The high here in September.
NEUT32|And then now we have.
NEUT33|This retrace going on right here.
NEUT34|And then now it's.
BEAR35|It's also broke the 50% line too, so it's just something to.
NEUT36|To keep an eye on here and.
BEAR37|It breaks down further than we're looking at.
NEUT38|250 area for actually not right?
NEUT39|That's not right right here.
NEUT40|246 area on the.
NEUT41|On the flip extension.
NEUT42|So there's definitely some.
NEUT43|Some weakness there to keep an eye on.
NEUT44|But right now this is a really, really important line, so if they bounce it off of here, they may be trying to run it up again.
BEAR45|My view is that we're rotating out in the NASDAQ stocks anyway.
NEUT46|And after this election, I think if Trump wins, I think he'll go after these social media companies pretty hard.
NEUT47|And it Biden wins.
NEUT48|Social media will die anyway 'cause?
NEUT49|The whole.
NEUT50|Trump.
NEUT51|You know, attack Trump attack for Trump, all that.
BEAR52|Velocity of activities is going to crash.
NEUT53|And so in there.
BEAR54|Plus, they're just extremely overvalued.
BEAR55|So I think that is actually trouble anyway.
NEUT56|But just something to keep an eye on.
NEUT57|So tomorrow is going to be a pretty interesting day in the market.
BULL58|And if the NASDAQ keeps falling, then we're looking for pretty decent correction.
NEUT59|So bear that in mind.
BULL60|"Anyway, you guys have a good one and I'll catch up with you later bye."""
