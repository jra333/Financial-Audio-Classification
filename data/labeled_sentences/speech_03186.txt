BULL0|"""Equity market rally has been impressive but also justified given this extremely robust economic backdrop."
BULL1|Combined with the abundance of monetary and fiscal support.
BULL2|So we think that above average valuations are warranted and we think this equity market rally does have further room to run.
NEUT3|So if above average valuations are warranted, why is it that interest rates are such a huge focus right now?
BEAR4|The conventional wisdom is that as interest rates go higher, those valuations and what people will pay for stocks tends to go lower.
NEUT5|Why the record highs in the market right now?
NEUT6|Given the backdrop and rates?
NEUT7|Yeah, well we have to think about the context as to why interest rates are rising.
NEUT8|It is not because central banks are stepping in and tightening monetary policy.
BULL9|Instead it is because of that stronger global growth backdrop that will inevitably feed into stronger corporate profits.
BULL10|And of course higher stock prices.
BULL11|But of course within the equity market space, there are some notable pockets of opportunity where rising interest rates will benefit, particularly in those value oriented sectors of the market that benefit from the reflationary trade, notably.
NEUT12|Resource is financials.
NEUT13|These are the pockets of the market that actually do well in an environment of rising interest rates have those sectors outrun their coverage, so to speak?
NEUT14|Candace, I mean, you look at the energy sector, the single best performing one in the SMP.
BULL15|So far this year for your resource resources trade, the financials are the second best performing sector by a wide margin.
BEAR16|How much is already priced into the marketplace right now given the fact that these stocks have been on a tear ever since the pandemic.
NEUT17|Close over a year ago.
BEAR18|Oh absolutely the performance gap has narrowed quite substantially since November.
NEUT19|But remember that that performance gap or that valuation gap between growth and so called value.
BEAR20|Stocks remains quite sizable in general after a long extended period of value related underperformance.
NEUT21|So we do think this has more room to run here as the global economy continues to gain ground throughout 2021, OK, so if that's the case are there specific?
NEUT22|Areas within those natural resources type companies financial type companies that you find interesting.
NEUT23|Is it the smaller mid sized banks is?
NEUT24|Is it the money center banks?
NEUT25|Is it oil and gas is at other parts of the mining complex.
NEUT26|What exactly is the value oriented trade right now?
NEUT27|Yeah right now the value oriented trade is those sectors of the market that are closely tide to the fortunes of the global economy and the reopening trade.
BEAR28|Of course the sectors that lagged.
NEUT29|Through the pandemic in 2020, so within the resourcespace.
BULL30|Obviously oil and gas on the prospect for a resumption, an energy consumption this summer as the economy continues to reopen financials, we think still have a lot of room to run.
BULL31|Given the prospect for higher interest rates, particularly at the long end of the curve.
NEUT32|So taken together, this value oriented trade based on the reflationary narrative that we've been talking about a stronger growth.
BULL33|Ample liquidity, you know, should carry these still underappreciated sectors higher throughout the year.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
