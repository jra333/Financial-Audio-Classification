NEUT0|"""Hello guys, in this video we're going to talk about Reno which is a car manufacturer in France."
BULL1|So I spotted the upside potential here at $22.22 euros.
BULL2|I'm sorry and the upside potential for 40% gains till 29 euro because both JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs put a target price for Reno at $29.00.
NEUT3|What happened was that.
NEUT4|Today Reno is 35.77 euro, so this is in my opinion an accumulation area right now.
NEUT5|And.
NEUT6|It is a hold for the moment if we look at the consensus target price of the analysts, we can see that 29 Euro 28 euro is the consensus price.
BULL7|But also JP Morgan Chase updated the target price to â‚¬40.
NEUT8|While other brokerages put it around 2530 or 22, I don't know if it will go to 40.
NEUT9|This is an estimate one year from now, but I think that 35 area is is doable.
NEUT10|Is it's a nice accumulation area in my opinion.
NEUT11|If they have enough sales.
