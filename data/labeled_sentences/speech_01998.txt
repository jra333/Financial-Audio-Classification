BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to a brand new video today.
NEUT2|We're going to talk about one of the most hyped up shoe of 2020, the chunky dunky's Nike SBS.
NEUT3|That's the weirdest name of a shoe.
NEUT4|Just so weird to say we don't care bout that.
NEUT5|We care if they're going to go up or down.
NEUT6|If you want to click out of this video, they're going to go down.
NEUT7|If you want to understand why.
NEUT8|If you guys have watched me for all my prediction videos, you guys know that shoes that typically start off really high don't keep going up even higher.
NEUT9|To give you an example that Travis Scott Six is those started off at like 1200, they went down to like 600 the off White 5.
NEUT10|Those also I'm pretty sure started off at like 1000 bills went down to like 6-7 hundred but for these it's a Nike SB.
NEUT11|Not very many people wear Nike S bees.
NEUT12|They're starting at $2000.
NEUT13|Just think about that.
NEUT14|$2000 for a shoe they just released today.
NEUT15|I don't really know any shoe that started at that price initially.
NEUT16|Like resell and kept going up.
NEUT17|So as always, it's pretty clear to me that.
NEUT18|After a couple of months, this shoe is going to go down to 1000.
NEUT19|In my personal opinion, it's just not a shoe that's going to keep going up.
NEUT20|That's too much for one single shoe, and it's just not a shoe to invest in.
NEUT21|Either way, like 95% of you guys probably aren't even thinking of investing into it, but I just kind of want to educate you guys as to why they just won't go up, and that was the first reason.
NEUT22|The second reason is I just don't think this shoe is as wearable as typical shoes that go up, such as the North Carolina Chicago Ones video I made.
NEUT23|I'm already seeing some sizes go up to.
NEUT24|$270 I posted that video week and a half ago and if you remember I said give it one month and they'll be at 2:50.
NEUT25|So not all sizes are at 2:50, but some of them already surpassed it.
NEUT26|So basically what I'm trying to say is invest in the shoes that are very wearable that are low risk.
NEUT27|Those started at like retail pretty much you can get a lot of pairs and you can make more profit off something like that.
NEUT28|So yeah, like I was saying, they're not the most wearable shoes, and they're also just not very good looking like appealing.
NEUT29|So if you scored them $400.
NEUT30|Retail just take that like $2000 profit and get rid of them.
NEUT31|You can spend your money elsewhere if you guys made money off the North Carolina to Chicago ones, please let me know in the comments below.
BULL32|I mean they went up so I guess potential profit.
NEUT33|If you were to sell them let me know in the comments below.
NEUT34|They give away for the North Carolina in Chicago ones will be posted in my next investment video.
NEUT35|So if we get this video to 2000 likes, I'm going to have another investment video.
NEUT36|It's going to be semi big issue honestly.
BULL37|Will have similar returns for the North Carolina Chicago ones.
BULL38|I just think these are going to go faster, so let's get this video to 2000 likes and you guys will be able to get another investment video and make more money with me and we can all grow together as a team.
NEUT39|I don't know, it's just this is so fun for me because it's just.
NEUT40|It's just so it's so awesome for me to see all you guys make money with me because for a long time it was basically just me doing this on my own and I didn't really tell anybody my investments.
NEUT41|But now I'm telling you guys what I do.
NEUT42|Like 50,000 people sometimes see it or more and you guys make money with me as well.
NEUT43|So that just means so much to me it's it's really fun for me.
NEUT44|So like I said, new investment video.
NEUT45|"We get this video 2000 likes and see you guys for the next one piece."""
