NEUT0|"""PRA Subramanian is here now with those details."
NEUT1|So what gives process?
NEUT2|Why is this happening?
NEUT3|Well, you know, a lot of investors were kind of bending an even bigger a bigger deal for elusive in its reverse merger, SPAC merger with the Triple Capital for group level Michael Klein.
NEUT4|But you know, it actually remains to be seen whether that deal actually could actually make a lot of money for these people, because you know, all offer the company you know, loosen, made about $4.4 billion in additional capital that they can use to fund their their operations.
NEUT5|And, you know, we spoke to CEO Peter Rawlinson today about that.
NEUT6|And you know, he said that the Mercedes-Benz S class is really is kind of his target.
NEUT7|It's really a technology race with Tesla.
NEUT8|That's really the big kind of war that he's waging.
NEUT9|Let's take a listen.
NEUT10|Well, I think that were virtually targeting Mercedes-Benz as a as a competitor as a cars of product, but I think it's a legitimate comparison in terms of technology.
BULL11|You know, I very much applaud what Tesla is done.
NEUT12|Tesla's valuation today is based upon its provenance as a tech company.
NEUT13|Why are the other car companies not worth as much as Tesla 'cause they simply don't have the technology?
NEUT14|And I don't think they get it.
NEUT15|I think Tesla gets it.
NEUT16|It recognizes this is a technology race.
NEUT17|Mix all the technology, Motors, inverters, transmissions, battery pack, all that Fusion with software.
NEUT18|The all important software in house and you know the other company that does that is lucid, so I think it's a legitimate comparison.
NEUT19|But you know in entering this technology race to make the most efficient, most effective electric cars, it's the customer wins, but ultimately it's everyone because we all the air.
NEUT20|And this is what the planet needs.
BULL21|Now a rapid transition to sustainable mobility and that can only come through healthy competition.
NEUT22|I've not seen the traditional car companies rise to the challenge right now.
NEUT23|Tesla doesn't have any competition.
NEUT24|You know, part of that competing with Tesla is actually what's happening with their factory listed as a factory in Casa Grande, AZ.
NEUT25|We got an update on that.
NEUT26|Basically the factories can complete, it is operational.
NEUT27|They're building a pre production run of lucid lucid air, and actually Peter said he actually had Alan Mulally, former Boeing and Ford CEO there, and Mullally gave one of the new cars a test drive and said he loved it.
NEUT28|So there you go.
NEUT29|Alright, you know.
BEAR30|Also, I know that the CEO said that you know part of the decline in the share price was because of the expected valuation, right?
NEUT31|It was supposed to be between, uh, this deal between like 12 and 15 billion.
BEAR32|He said that that that there was a misunderstanding on the part of investors.
NEUT33|What do you say to that?
NEUT34|Well, you know they had about a pro forma value around 24 billion, but equity value on 16 and a little bit less than that, so you know it's just coming.
NEUT35|I my understanding is that investors expected it to be an even more bigger value, but in the sense Lucid got what they wanted, they got the money they needed.
NEUT36|They got the payoff they needed for their shareholders.
BULL37|You got another pipe investment from the Saudis.
BEAR38|So in my opinion the company got away OK, it's just retail investors that may have been a bit kind of frothy with what they thought.
BULL39|"They would get out of this deal."""
