BULL0|"""U.S. stocks rising Friday following a softer than expected August Jobs report."
BEAR1|Nonfarm payrolls increasing by a seasonally adjusted 151 thousand and the unemployment rate remaining unchanged from July at 4.9%, joining us now to discuss this, WSJ chief economics commentator Gregory IP in Washington.
BULL2|Hi Greg, great to see you.
NEUT3|So a conference for having me absolutely so economists had projected the report would indicate an additional 100 and.
BEAR4|80,000 jobs and the unemployment rate would be lowered to 4.8%.
BEAR5|So is this software report considered disappointing?
NEUT6|It's a disappointing, but only against that very sort of like strict standard that economists set for themselves.
BULL7|150,000 is actually pretty good.
BEAR8|I mean, if you think about the fact that trend job growth is about 100,000 per month, the fact that we're still doing 150,000 an even better on an average basis for the last three or four months suggested the economy continues to make up ground lost during the Great Recession.
BEAR9|And isn't August traditionally a soft month for job addition anyway.
NEUT10|Well, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which put these numbers together, tries to like adjust the numbers for predictable seasonal fluctuations, but they can't always fully get a right.
NEUT11|And there's always funny things that go on.
BEAR12|For example, with when school teachers go back to school that throw the numbers off.
BEAR13|So for example, people were disappointed by the fact that hourly earnings only grew zero point 1% this month, and wage growth has been the kind of the missing link in the current recovery.
BEAR14|But August is a funny month for wage growth.
NEUT15|We had more work days than normal, and we also took the survey on this data.
BULL16|Before some people got their paychecks and maybe their wages are doing a little bit better than we think.
BEAR17|Just because of those seasonal fluctuations, well, this jobs report certainly seems to be OK with the markets, the Dow, NASDAQ, and the S&P are up on the news.
NEUT18|How did the bond market respond, Greg?
BEAR19|Well, initially the bond market, the stock market both saw the lower than consensus expectation as meaning the Fed was less likely to raise interest rates in September and possibly December, but it seems that the bond market has a rethink and so yields which were down initially are now actually higher on the day.
BEAR20|In my view, the Fed is not going to see this report as either strengthening or weakening the case for a rate increase if job growth had been a lot weaker, I think you definitely take September off the table and maybe even December fed a lot stronger.
BULL21|That would have really strengthened the case for moving September.
BULL22|I think this basically meets Janet Yellen's criteria that we need to have solid labor force growth and progress towards their 2% inflation goal, and so I think September is in play.
NEUT23|It's not my best case, but I think it's still in place.
NEUT24|It's in play OK 'cause that was gonna be my next question is as we know the August Jobs report is the last broad reading of the labor market before the Federal Reserve's September meeting.
NEUT25|What else, then, will the Fed have to look into?
NEUT26|Do you think before making their decision?
NEUT27|Well, we'll get a collection of other sort of secondary indicators.
NEUT28|Everything related to housing and factory activity and so forth.
NEUT29|The most important additional data point that they will get will be the inflation data for August will get just before their next meeting, and I think the big factor holding them back from a faster pace of rate normalization has been inflation.
NEUT30|It hasn't been jobs data which even including today's been pretty good.
NEUT31|The underlying inflation rate that they look at is only around 1.6%.
BEAR32|It's been stuck there for several months.
NEUT33|They're trying to get it to 2% and I think the more dovish members of the Fed.
BULL34|Are going to be pressuring Janet Yellen not to pull the trigger so soon given unless they get some sign out of that inflation data that we see in the next few weeks that they are making more progress towards 2%.
NEUT35|Alright, Greg IP in Washington.
NEUT36|Thank you so much for your read on that, thanks.
BULL37|"Alright thanks."""
