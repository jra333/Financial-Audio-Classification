NEUT12|Microsoft develops and implement software services, devices, and solutions.
NEUT13|As of this recording, Microsoft has a market capitalization of $885 billion and a price per share of around $115.00.
NEUT14|To buy or not to buy?
NEUT15|That is the question.
NEUT16|Here are some reasons you might want to consider buying Microsoft.
BULL17|Microsoft is a hybrid growth and dividend stock, which means the company has a bright future ahead of them while also having the capability to pay out a consistently increasing dividend in terms of growth potential.
NEUT18|Microsoft can be classified as a high growth stock due to its.
BULL19|Earnings potential of over 20% under the leadership of Satya Nadella.
BULL20|The company has become more nimble and customer centric.
BULL21|Transitioning out of the PC era and increasing revenue from diversified business segments.
BULL22|However, its most notable revenue generator is it's intelligent Cloud or Microsoft Azure, which grew 89% this fiscal year.
NEUT23|Microsoft Azure owns more market share in the cloud computing space than Amazon, Oracle, IBM and Salesforce.
BULL24|This past fiscal year, Microsoft returned $5.3 billion to shareholders, which is up 16% year over year.
BULL25|All this and the dividend coverage ratio is still 1.3 and as mentioned earlier, earnings are expected to continue to increase.
NEUT26|But here are some reasons to not on Microsoft Calculator.
NEUT27|Microsoft's intrinsic value by discounting future cash flows, suggestive.
BULL28|The stock already has quite a bit of future growth already priced in, and it has a PE multiple of 53, well above the industry average.
BEAR29|These metrics suggest that if the stock market were to crash, just like Alibaba, and many of these other large growth companies today, shareholders shouldn't be surprised if Microsoft falls faster than the rest of the market.
BEAR30|In addition, Microsoft is competing with some of the toughest companies in the tech industry right now, and most notably the Fang Stocks Microsoft cannot afford to make mistakes.
NEUT31|So what do you say?
NEUT32|Bye or no?
BULL33|Does Microsoft's future growth potential and steady dividend justify its relatively high valuation?
BULL34|Can you keep up with this fierce competition?
