BULL0|"""The happiest place on earth."
NEUT1|Not exactly the happiest.
NEUT2|Little quiet right now.
BEAR3|Disney Parks around the world still shut.
BEAR4|We're going on several months now due to the coronavirus the parks.
NEUT5|This is why it matters.
NEUT6|Make up 37% of the revenue.
NEUT7|Last year that Walt Disney Company made.
NEUT8|So as they prepare to announce their earnings in just a few minutes from now, we bring in a guy who bought his first share of Disney when he was 13 years old.
NEUT9|Gerber Kawasaki CEO Ross Gerber joining us now what?
NEUT10|10-15 years later, right?
BULL11|For us, thanks for joining us.
BEAR12|Tell us about, you know why we should take a chance on Disney when we know that a the theme parks are not close to opening in Tirolian be the stock is at $101.00 it's well off its highs but it's also off its lows.
NEUT13|Well, that's why you got to buy it.
NEUT14|I mean, what worse could happen to Disney?
NEUT15|You know other than shutting every park in theater, so that's baked into the stock and it's only down you know 30% or something.
NEUT16|And so when you think about what I get when things get back to what we will call the new normal.
BULL17|What an opportunity.
NEUT18|Because this has been a gift to Disney because even though they've had to shut down to very important parts of the company, those will open again.
BULL19|But they've been able to capitalize on.
BULL20|Direct to consumer streaming, which is the future of Disney, and because of the pandemic they've been able to just ramp subscriber growth of not just Disney plus, but Hulu as well.
NEUT21|And we're going to see blowout numbers from them on the corner, so while everybody is salivating over Netflix at, you know 10 times revenue and several 100 times earnings, you know Disney's got 3 streaming services and eventually trust me, all the parts will be open again, OK?
NEUT22|OK, I get that an I'm an optimist and I'm big on buying low.
NEUT23|Certainly but.
NEUT24|We gotta look at one of their biggest networks, the network of ESPN.
NEUT25|There are no live sports all be it except for Korean baseball.
NEUT26|They did bring back live Korean baseball this morning.
NEUT27|My son wasn't too excited.
NEUT28|He kind of wants to see the Yankees, but now I see the Indians.
NEUT29|But this this we don't know how this is going to end.
NEUT30|There isn't any hockey right now.
NEUT31|There's no football, at least for the moment.
NEUT32|And it's just no tennis.
NEUT33|I mean, is there even going to Wimbledon?
NEUT34|That's ESPN carries that.
NEUT35|If we are not going to just be this OK, our lives aren't going to be just, you know, automatically.
NEUT36|So it's gonna take till next year.
NEUT37|Think about live sports, pent up demand for live sports.
BEAR38|I mean, look at this success they've had with the last dance with the Michael Jordan story, it's been off the charts, ratings.
NEUT39|People want the content.
NEUT40|So when you're talking about parks or you're talking about sports, when comes back, the demand is going to be twice what it used to be.
NEUT41|So there's no asset.
NEUT42|I would rather.
NEUT43|Moment yes, yeah, and sports comes back and that's why you gotta buy low when things look really bad like now and then.
NEUT44|In a year when we're watching baseball again and going to theme parks again, trust me, will be you'll be like wow, what an opportunity to have bought Disney and that's now.
BEAR45|Alright, well year to date is down about 29% an I'm just looking 52 week range.
NEUT46|The high 153 yet you're still buying it at a discount everybody 101 thirty Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki.
NEUT47|Hey listen, we're seeing green across the board here everything from silver to the Dow to the NASDAQ.
BULL48|Moving higher.
NEUT49|I'll see it tonight.
