NEUT0|"""Hello everyone I am Arun Yadav Internet the Sparc foundation."
NEUT1|This is my tasks created Decision tree classifier and visualize a graphical performance task.
NEUT2|First we have to import required library Surface panda number matplotlib.
NEUT3|Then maybe read the data set for this time we are using it is.
NEUT4|It'll said this is most payment data set for in machine learning machine learning.
NEUT5|Then here to check the shape of the data.
NEUT6|Describe the data.
NEUT7|Then we check it.
NEUT8|Formation of the data we check.
NEUT9|There is no value are present in not.
NEUT10|We use malware.
NEUT11|Null well function.
NEUT12|Then we declare feature vector and target variable.
NEUT13|Then we split the data.
NEUT14|Unique value are present in data.
NEUT15|Then we dissect this isn't a classifier with winning index.
NEUT16|We initialize the decision tree model that we predict the value with Jimmy index.
BEAR17|The model increases score, which quickly critics and gain index that is worse.
NEUT18|Then we take a crisis core training set.
NEUT19|Accuracy is food that is 0.9524.
NEUT20|Then we check the train.
NEUT21|Train and test at receipt.
NEUT22|Then we utilize the tree graphically.
NEUT23|This is a tree that visual traffic early, then we.
NEUT24|Check compare the train set and taste accuracy.
NEUT25|Then we paint the score in training test.
NEUT26|Then we plot 3.
NEUT27|This is it really?
NEUT28|This isn't a driver present in visualization, then we.
NEUT29|K conclusion metric in classification it so an exact value of the data set in which is result and conclusion.
NEUT30|"So before you waste a crazy using this data set, thank you."""
