NEUT0|"""Tiffany, I think you are firmly in the bull market camp."
NEUT1|Would you be adding positions here to start off the new quarter?
BEAR2|Potentially on some that have underperformed last quarter like in technology?
NEUT3|Absolutely.
NEUT4|I definitely think it's a good time to buy, and I think that we really need to pay attention to the fact that we are in a bull market.
BEAR5|We started in the new bull market in 2020 and we're still in it, but things have slowed down, right?
BEAR6|So we understand that we're kind of coming out of this really crazy and weird situation of this event driven recession.
NEUT7|And, you know, we're anticipating volatility.
NEUT8|We're already seeing that, so we can even look to, you know.
NEUT9|A week or two ago when technology where we had days where you know we were just closing our eyes and watching some of these technology numbers.
NEUT10|But then you know today is a different story.
NEUT11|So these conversations about growth versus value in tech versus you know other industries are going to continue to happen and so yes, we are using opportunities.
NEUT12|For for you know dips to buy the things that we like.
NEUT13|So in tech there are a number of things that we like.
NEUT14|We're really paying attention to two companies that we think are going to weather storms and examples.
BULL15|Air BNB that we love it's, you know, really has been able to kind of pivot.
NEUT16|Do this really quick pivot during during a pandemic right?
BULL17|And we really think that it really has a huge runway for growth.
NEUT18|So when you look at look at their market share, they've got about 25.
NEUT19|Maybe 20% of the of the current market share of vacation rentals.
NEUT20|However, there's this new thing now, right?
NEUT21|This new kind of category called work from Anywhere, which is a real thing.
NEUT22|And looking at Airbnbs competition, if you really combined the top five hotel chains in the world, Airbnb is bigger than all of them combined.
NEUT23|Oppurtunity in terms of buying things on the dip, Tiffany?
NEUT24|What about bonds?
NEUT25|Clearly Q1 was not the quarter to own them.
NEUT26|Are you tempted to buy them now?
NEUT27|Yes, so you know we're investing portfolios.
NEUT28|Entire portfolios for clients were not just buying stocks, and we're not just buying bonds.
NEUT29|So while bonds are have not been super duper popular there, I've always been in our portfolio and we think they're important going forward.
NEUT30|So for the investor that was really excited about individual stocks and kind of catching that that tech wave throughout 2020 where we would suggest that it might be a good time to buy bonds if you don't already have bonds because we do see bonds is a good diversifier.
BULL31|And definitely an opportunity to kind of soften those blow.
NEUT32|So we've always had them an for investors that don't have them.
NEUT33|It might be a good time to buy them.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
