NEUT0|"""Here's our stock in focus."
NEUT1|We're looking at Netflix here.
NEUT2|This is one that's done.
BULL3|You have had a very nice run.
BULL4|Went through a pretty good correction action here.
BEAR5|Big gap down.
BULL6|We see the recovery here, but what's important is we're seeing this retracement from the main swing to the first high an that's a 50% retracement.
NEUT7|You see it hold and you're seeing prices.
NEUT8|Really try to make another attempt higher but not able to just break it here so you're really looking for this breakthrough.
NEUT9|These lows?
NEUT10|You see that break and then you'll see a nether gas blower.
BEAR11|And it'll probably accelerate if it cannot break over the 400 range.
NEUT12|I've even put it as 4408409.
NEUT13|That's our stop here.
BEAR14|On our system, you know, I would think that it's it's going to have a very, very tough time trying to sustain this.
BEAR15|I do think you'll see this probably break even further to downside.
NEUT16|"That's our stock and focus."""
