BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about Spotify.
NEUT2|Now, what they do is music streaming.
NEUT3|That one should be commonly known.
BULL4|Current surprise $252.59, which gives the market cap of $48 billion revenue $7.9 billion, which is up 15 ISH percent which not really great for a company.
BEAR5|This young earnings negative $600 million which also not great.
NEUT6|I would expect them to be like.
BULL7|Getting close to break even now.
NEUT8|Necessarily making a profit, obviously, but.
NEUT9|Not not liking this much.
BEAR10|Money lost.
BEAR11|Current P negative 83 forward P unlisted, which means they probably won't make a profit next year either dividend is zero.
NEUT12|I don't expect that to change ever really.
BULL13|I can't see them making enough of a profit anytime soon anyway, total assets, $6.3 billion total liabilities $3.5 billion, which gives them total stockholders equity of $2.8 billion, which is higher than the previous year, which is confusing 'cause they lost money.
BULL14|But good on them.
NEUT15|I guess you know it helps.
NEUT16|It helps alot risk factors.
NEUT17|Apple Music, Amazon Prime Music, YouTube Music.
NEUT18|There's many others.
BULL19|Overall, I think that them being the first obviously has some sort of brand recognition.
NEUT20|Also, they're different and probably better so.
NEUT21|They have some things going for them, but they are also facing the three biggest companies in the world I think.
NEUT22|Not quite, no.
NEUT23|I don't know.
NEUT24|Yeah, Microsoft should be in there anyway, so.
NEUT25|Obviously they're competing with the biggest companies that have a lot of money that could probably either just buy him out or just be better, and so I don't really know how viable Spotify is long term.
NEUT26|And so I definitely don't think that I'll invest in this, but.
NEUT27|Then I mean for a growth investor, the growth I don't think justifies the valuation.
NEUT28|They have a market cap of $48 billion, which is 8 times the six times the revenue.
BULL29|And to even get a reasonable valuation, they would have to probably double that like 5-6 times, and then make a really nice profit margin on top of that.
NEUT30|And I don't really see that happening, especially when the current growth is 15%.
NEUT31|So I don't think the valuation is really justified.
NEUT32|Obviously dividend investors are out and for a value investor, I mean the balance sheet is nice, but that's about it.
NEUT33|So overall, probably.
NEUT34|Don't buy this.
NEUT35|I definitely won't.
NEUT36|That's it for me.
NEUT37|For today.
