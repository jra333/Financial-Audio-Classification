NEUT0|"""Today we are going through NEO stock analysis and price prediction."
NEUT1|November 6th.
BEAR2|Electric carmaker NIO has been on a tear in the past month.
BULL3|In fact, NEO stock is up 69% over that span, and more than 1000% the past six months.
NEUT4|This is incredible, but whether this continues depends on how well the company performs and its outlook.
NEUT5|Neo, a Chinese company that does not have to follow SEC quarterly reporting rules, will report its earnings on November 17th.
NEUT6|However, the company recently provided an update on its October delivery performance.
BULL7|Delivery forecasts Nile reported on November 2nd that it delivered 5055 electric vehicles FS, which was up 100.1% over the amount last year and year.
BULL8|To date, it has delivered thirty 1400 and 30th is up 111.4%.
BULL9|Additionally, NIO reported on October 2nd that it's September deliveries rose by 133.2% over last year with 4708.
BULL10|FS Moreover, its third quarter deliveries rose by 154.3% over last year with 12,206 deliveries.
BULL11|This also represents significant monthly progress.
NEUT12|For example, in August it delivered 3965 FS and in July there were 3533 deliveries.
BULL13|So the October deliveries were up 7.4% over September and up 27.5% over August.
BULL14|So think about that in two months its monthly deliveries are up by 27.5%.
BULL15|Therefore, let's assume it's average monthly increase is 13.75%.
BULL16|At this pace, NIO could deliver 5750 in November and 6540 in December that results in 17,345 estimated deliveries in Q4, or 42.1% more than the 12,206 in Q3 and 67.9% more than the 10,331 delivered in Q1.
NEUT17|In turn, we can use this to estimate some numbers for NIO stocks value.
NEUT18|What is means fornaio?
NEUT19|Let's try to put some dollar numbers on these forecasts.
NEUT20|I will try to make this fairly simple so that we can estimate what NEO stock is worth.
NEUT21|Now we know two things from the Q2 earnings report.
NEUT22|First, Nile delivered 10,331 electric vehicles.
NEUT23|Second, they had revenue of $493.4 million.
NEUT24|Now, provided the conversion into dollars therefore.
NEUT25|We can calculate the average selling price ASP of the Q2FS if we divide $493.40 by 10,331 vehicles, the ASP is $47,759.
BULL26|Using this information and assuming that asks increase by 1% per quarter, I estimate that the company will produce forty 3720 US in 2020 with a total revenue of $2.1 billion.
BULL27|However, my forecast for 2021 shows that revenue is set to explode by increased slightly.
BULL28|The monthly average delivery growth to 15% per month.
BULL29|This works out to 52% growth quarter over quarter.
BULL30|In addition, I kept the 1% quarterly asked increase.
BULL31|Thanks for watching.
