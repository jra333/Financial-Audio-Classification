NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol NAK."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do.
NEUT4|What offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR5|Well, the pull back on this one continues an yet today was rough.
BULL6|Just because things started off nicely with the gap up, made a move upwards.
NEUT7|Got all the way to that area and then from there just you know the price completely rolled back over and back down.
NEUT8|It went.
NEUT9|So really depends on what your angle was.
NEUT10|What was your game plan going in?
NEUT11|Again, if you're a day trader and you bought right there and you wanted to buy and sell within 15 minutes, well then from that angle.
BEAR12|Yeah, the chart looks really bad, but assuming you care about the bigger picture, yes it was annoying day, but that doesn't mean that the entire charts destroyed or anything like that.
NEUT13|But the level here that does still remain very important moving forward.
NEUT14|And the good news is, it wasn't even really tested today, but down there right around that 75 cent mark and $0.75 is important because if the price were to go down to that area and then breakdown through it and keep on moving, I mean what would the price be doing at that point?
NEUT15|That would be putting the price right back to where it was before the big move that occurred on Friday with that big gap up.
NEUT16|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements go back to where they were, not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that, but at least as if the price just stays above that area as it's been doing well, what does that give you that still gives you a set of those here and when you compare that to that set of those right there?
NEUT17|If you envision those steps, well, least you still have stair steps making progress in the upward direction, and that's what it's all about.
NEUT18|It's all about making and showing those signs of progress, and that's what, again, that 75 cent Mark is representing as far as areas of resistance are concern.
BEAR19|There definitely does seem to be some selling pressure up there, right around that 85 cent mark, so $0.85 will be Public Enemy number one headed into not necessarily just Tuesday, but over the next couple of days here.
NEUT20|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT21|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT22|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT23|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT24|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT25|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL26|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT27|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT28|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR29|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT30|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT31|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT32|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT33|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
