BEAR0|"""I understand the coronavirus is a serious issue, so many people have lost their loved ones and they've got to unfathomable suffering and quarantine in China."
NEUT1|Who we know is not the best.
NEUT2|Basically everyone suffering right now, but the point of this video is to show you a new perspective from the investment side of things and how this can be a great opportunity for people looking to get into the stock market.
NEUT3|If Warren Buffett, the greatest and best of all time is saying it is Gary have a quote.
NEUT4|This shouldn't affect the way you do your stocks and quote if someone like that who is achieved an immense investment portfolio.
NEUT5|Saying this, I think we should follow his example, my ETF and if you notice your ETS, I'll give you a quick rundown.
NEUT6|Otherwise, I've already made a detailed video about it and I'll leave the link up here.
NEUT7|Otherwise, ETF stands for Exchange traded funds.
NEUT8|So basically what that is is you give your money to a company and what they do is they pull your money alongside other investors money and they invest it into the stock market.
NEUT9|So for example, what ETF's are known for is they diversify, so they invest in multiple multiple stocks, not like 1 stock.
NEUT10|This keep diversifying, diversifying, for example, one of the ETF I got is the top 200 Australian companies in the Australian Stock Exchange, so that's 200 companies on the SX, so a small percentage of my money is going through all those 200 companies.
NEUT11|That's why TSR that same ETF of Aussie top 200 companies on the SX had a unit price of $30.
BEAR12|Now it's dropped to $26.
NEUT13|You will say or $4 and don't see much, but if your investor and you bought for example 10 units, you'd save $40.
NEUT14|It's insane what's happening in the market right now, and that's why I'm trying to show you and give you a grasp on and some of you may be wondering what if the ETF crashes?
NEUT15|Festival in ATF is not an individual stock like I just said.
NEUT16|Let's say this girl example we had for the top 200 companies.
NEUT17|Let's say if it's twenty of them somehow went bankrupt in this coronavirus time period, it just 20 used to have 180 more companies with their money in it.
NEUT18|Like 180 more and if you consider this risky, I honestly do not know what to say.
NEUT19|If you're still not convinced, let's go to the greatest source of all time and that's history.
NEUT20|As many of you know, history repeats itself and let's see what's happened in the past when there's been other epidemics or pandemics.
NEUT21|And what happened to the stock market?
NEUT22|So let's get right into that.
NEUT23|I'll give you the list of pandemics which month it was.
NEUT24|Then six month change in SMP.
NEUT25|512 month change.
NEUT26|Also in SMP 500 then I'll give you six months for the mssi.
NEUT27|How'd responded worldwide, OK?
BEAR28|So HIV it's read across the board six months later, point 312 months later, is negative.
BEAR29|16, Five and Worldwide's affected by it as well.
NEUT30|Then the rest of it, pneumonic plague.
BEAR31|It was affected by the Mssi, but not SMP SARS.
NEUT32|All positive avian flu.
NEUT33|All positive Dong fever, all positive swine flu, all positive colera all positive Merce all positive Ebola.
BULL34|All positive measles is pretty much even.
NEUT35|It didn't really go up or down.
BULL36|It affect a little bit on 12 months, but the MSC I went up.
BULL37|Zika, all positive, worldwide.
NEUT38|It wasn't positive again.
BULL39|Measles in 2019 all positive.
NEUT40|You don't have 12 months because it was just in June of 2019.
