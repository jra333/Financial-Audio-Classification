NEUT0|"""Yeah, we woke up this morning and the first thing we talked about is is like wow, it's official."
NEUT1|The Olympic Games are postponed.
NEUT2|What does that mean?
NEUT3|What are we gonna do?
NEUT4|Also, the more you said in Eugene, and that's not just union, look at it, goodnight technique and to stay cool today.
NEUT5|Each test Mr. OK. Hello mate, how's it going?
NEUT6|Is it OK?
NEUT7|I mean, it's absolutely the right decision to focus.
NEUT8|Wasn't there that obviously the training facilities weren't there and everything.
NEUT9|Everything screeched to a halt and you're, you know it was time for us to focus on family.
NEUT10|But you're asking athletes to prepare themselves for the most important competition you know of their lives that the best choice is to do it.
NEUT11|As I said before, the sooner they can, but the safer they can.
NEUT12|We started also to think of.
NEUT13|If this Olympic Games will be really fair, if they are still in July and August for many reasons, like everyone cannot trend the same way, to be honest, is there's a little part.
NEUT14|I mean, it's like oh thank God, you know at least we know at least now we know.
BULL15|I know it's the right decision.
BEAR16|This is something that's affecting everybody.
NEUT17|Would put a lot of people's health and see health and safety at risk if it moved forward as planned.
NEUT18|How's it made me feel?
NEUT19|I mean, to be honest, I don't think it's fully sunk in, you know, it's it's hard to take a little bit.
NEUT20|This was going to be my last Olympics.
NEUT21|I started sport when I was nine years old with the goal of eventually going to the Olympics someday and then last year I punched my ticket and.
NEUT22|I had I feel like I had so much to look forward to going into 2020.
NEUT23|Goes on camp in Europe, away from my husband for three months.
NEUT24|Just kind of in the mode where you put your nose down like it's the final Sprint towards something that you've been working towards your whole life and.
NEUT25|We were worried they were going to cancel and if they cancel it for us, it's like someone just being like, oh, you know what you go back to the bottom then you start at the bottom of the mountain.
BEAR26|My personal frustration after be put apart for something much more big.
NEUT27|Training in the in the living room.
NEUT28|It's not so easy to fence in the house in the garage, in a very confined spaces is quite difficult, and in our fencing trainer is not with us here.
BULL29|All our good.
NEUT30|Kit that we were hoping to use for the Olympics is now in Japan.
NEUT31|I don't own a treadmill on the 2nd floor so I don't think the downstairs neighbors would appreciate if I got a treadmill.
NEUT32|We will over the next few weeks and months.
NEUT33|Be planning on how how we approach the next year, the extra year.
NEUT34|If you like, we're young.
BULL35|We're lucky.
BULL36|We're both healthy and we were kind of both stepped back and said OK, if it doesn't happen now we have more time to prepare.
NEUT37|I'm looking forward to spending some time with my husband.
BULL38|"There's not really any way I can isolate away from him, so he will be spending the next 14 days on self isolation with me, so it'll be nice to have some quality time together."""
