NEUT3|The values presented in this report or own and have no bearing or responsibility.
NEUT4|If they are wrong or misrepresent Facebook Inc will do the fundamental analysis ratio analysis and valuation analysis of Facebook stock and as per our analysis, our pitch is to buy.
NEUT5|We expected and we recommend investors to buy Facebook at current market price for a target of 191.86 dollars.
NEUT6|This is a Facebook basic information about Facebook Inc. Like its ticker symbol, year of incorporation and the President employs.
NEUT7|Next, to me a fundamental analysis.
NEUT8|Radiant.
NEUT9|So why not the latest?
NEUT10|The next analyst, Richard on Facebook, is supported by posting analysis.
NEUT11|Now this analysis gives us the threat of new entrant as model for Facebook, while the competition of industry and customer bargaining power is high, the supplier bargaining power is very low.
NEUT12|The SWOT analysis gives us the positives for Facebook like the strength and the opportunities for Facebook in the near future as well as it also tells us the weakness and threads regarding Facebook.
NEUT13|Next weekend and the issue analysis on Facebook using radius ratios that we are gathered from number of financial websites.
NEUT14|Facebook's financial statement for the past three years, which was provided by mental research tools, which includes mainly the PBE ratio and for margin.
NEUT15|Switch it up for this year, 2014, fifteen and 16 current ratio ratio.
NEUT16|As you can see, being too high implies it's inefficient use of assets.
NEUT17|Rest of their issues are very positive.
NEUT18|Next we show up.
NEUT19|Same industry social media.
NEUT20|So as you can see from the highlighted cells in the present market scenario.
BEAR21|Removing the financial ratios indicates the company with a strong fundamentals and effective leadership with focus on increasing profits and revenues.
BULL22|As you can see, the high beam indicator investors confidence in future growth and prospects.
NEUT23|Dependency on the advertising for the revenue.
NEUT24|Facebook should really concentrate on developing alternative sources of revenues in the near future.
BULL25|We estimate Facebook to load an animal CHTR or 54% over the next few years.
BULL26|We also expect a healthy growth in the profit over the years due to the dominant position in the market.
NEUT27|As a result, Facebook will go on a major portion of the advertising dollars.
BULL28|We expected tax burden to reduce over the coming years due to Trump's tax reform.
NEUT29|However, we haven't considered it in our estimation due to the uncertainties in the administration's policies.
NEUT30|The target price over the next year is 191.86 dollars at a target price to earnings multiple of 38.36.
NEUT31|The average yield for 10 year Treasury bonds is 2.26%.
NEUT32|The market rate is 10.09%.
BULL33|The market seems slightly overvalued at this point of time, though.
NEUT34|They will leave.
NEUT35|Facebook is currently in a bull market, but a combination of valuation methodologies and qualitative analysis indicate that we are not at the peak of a bull market.
NEUT36|Hence we recommend investors to buy the stock at current market price.
BULL37|But an expected it done of Levain .5% in the next year.
BULL38|"Thank you."""
