NEUT2|Well, no company can guarantee truly guarantee its dividend these days.
NEUT3|At least the Wolfe of companies I trust Mike to protect chevrons payout, which currently yields almost 7%.
BULL4|That is better than a sharp stick in the eye worth.
BEAR5|Also new to drop out of the bidding war for Anadarko Pete when Occidental paid in astounding 55 billion for it.

NEUT8|Leviathan second, if you want a fast growing producer, I want you to go with parsley energy, and this one's at 10 bucks.
NEUT9|I bet you buy this one tomorrow.
NEUT10|It's got great management and bizarrely for American oil Company they actually care about the environment.
NEUT11|Sure, they're still in the fossil fuel business.
