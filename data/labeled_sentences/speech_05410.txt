BULL0|"""Hello guys, welcome back to my channel."
NEUT1|So in this video I'm going to be talking about oh CGN.
BEAR2|And today it seemed to have given up some of those gains from yesterday, and it has kind of fallen back here, so it has.
NEUT3|Landed back at $12.69 so it is kind of the pattern.
NEUT4|Here is basically a harami which basically is an indication of reversal indicator, so it should kind of continue on a downtrend here because when you basically have the harami at the top.
NEUT5|It basically indicates that it is going to reverse and travels down, so let's see if this kind of plays out in that direction.
NEUT6|So that's all I had for the stock in terms of supports.
NEUT7|Let's see.
BEAR8|There seems to be a support around $8.73, and then the bottom of this week, which is around 908, is also probably a support.
NEUT9|And after that there's a big gap to fill, which is 595.
BEAR10|So if that doesn't happen, then we're probably might fall off to the 595 levels.
NEUT11|So keep an eye out on that.
NEUT12|"Yeah, that's about it for oh CGN."""
