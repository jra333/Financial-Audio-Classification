BULL0|"""You do have this call that you believe the SNP can reach 1500 and we are on a day where the markets are starting to."
BULL1|You know, balance back from those lows in March.
NEUT2|React positively to any bright signs that we have.
BEAR3|How much are you sticking to the idea that we're going to reach new lows here and how bad can it get?
NEUT4|We come out in two directions.
NEUT5|I think one is from an investment thesis.
NEUT6|The market at this level, based upon where earnings are, doesn't represent any kind of intrinsic value that's worth pursuing.
NEUT7|It is being entirely propped up by liquidity.
NEUT8|My technical work from a week or two ago suggested that your term we could get to 2850 and then we would probably head lower again.
NEUT9|If you look at the period following the stock market crash of 29 or you look at the bear market that started in in 2007 that that went into 2008.
BEAR10|Both of those initial declines were followed by rather large retracements.
NEUT11|In some cases more than 50.
NEUT12|So I I retracement after a really hard decline is exactly what we should be expecting here.
NEUT13|So it doesn't fundamentally change my perspective Sonali that that that it's in P will be meaningfully lower if you know it could be 15116 hundred 1200.
NEUT14|But there are various ways to calculate the target, but you know, I think that.
NEUT15|Is that you know, investors who are sitting out there right now?
NEUT16|He rebalanced a few weeks ago and moved from fixed income to equity.
NEUT17|Should probably be thinking about Re balancing again because the equity left the equity increase.
BULL18|"I don't think ultimately will be sustainable."""
