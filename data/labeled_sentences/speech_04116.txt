NEUT0|"""Continue this conversation right now talking about what this unionization vote could mean for Amazon Henry Blodgett."
NEUT1|Here he is.
NEUT2|Of course, the CEO and co-founder inside a rank.
NEUT3|Henry is also going to weigh in on this huge selling and media stocks related to this archegos Capital Management margin call that took place late last week.
NEUT4|But let's start with Amazon and the way you see it, Henry in terms of what's at stake now and what's its take longer term for Amazon.
BULL5|Well, I I think it's interesting that Amazon is the company that's being targeted because they have been more proactive about raising at least salaries for employees, but incredibly higher profile.
NEUT6|Obviously a lot of people work there now, so it's not surprising.
NEUT7|I think stepping back from it, the really important larger story here is just the increasing bifurcation in the economy between shareholders and everybody who works for a living.
NEUT8|And I think that there have to be ways for companies to share more of the value that they create.
NEUT9|With the people who created their employees, and I think that that's the at the heart of this, I think I think for Amazon I, I think they will work through this.
NEUT10|I I don't think it's a devastating if the Union is created, as Deirdre does said you many years of negotiation and it's one place and maybe in other places there won't be unions.
NEUT11|But I do think this is a story about the US economy and I think we will continue to see more of this.
NEUT12|But Henry, I think going to this issue of even just how Amazon is dealing on social media with the likes of Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, do you think that the strategy of pushing back on them on pushing back on unions is the right one?
NEUT13|They, you know, Amazon is considered one of those popular companies in the country, if not the most popular, and so maybe they.
NEUT14|Maybe they have an authentic claim on being able to push back.
NEUT15|Or do you think that that is a losing strategy longer term?
BEAR16|But I don't think the execution over the weekend at the end of last week helped them particularly.
BULL17|I think they do have a strong case to make.
BULL18|Which is they lead their industry in raising wages to $15.00 an hour.
NEUT19|They have health care.
NEUT20|This is something that other companies like Walmart and Target all the fast food companies have not yet done.
BEAR21|They've been fighting it.
NEUT22|They will move toward it overtime.
NEUT23|So I think Amazon does have good arguments there, and I do think that people actually do generally like Amazon.
NEUT24|So there is Henry probably.
NEUT25|Why do you think that Amazon think their their Twitter war with smart?
NEUT26|If you think Amazon's on the right side of things relative to the Walmarts and targets of the world, why do you think they get the I don't think it's disproportionate or not, but they get a lot of attention.
NEUT27|As you know from the left from Elizabeth Warren from a Bernie Sanders.
NEUT28|Appropriate not appropriate.
NEUT29|Well, they they get what Walmart in its heyday got, which is.
BEAR30|You're destroying small businesses.
NEUT31|You're funneling all the money now to the richest person in the world.
NEUT32|It's just an easy company to attack that way and they're huge.
NEUT33|They employ almost a million people, so so there's a lot to gain from that.
BULL34|That stock has done so well it's so high profile so very easy target.
BULL35|But I do think they again they are headed in the right direction.
NEUT36|I think everybody else needs to follow them.
NEUT37|And I think as a society and economy, we need to think more about, you, know big rich companies can afford to make sure that their full time employees aren't poor.
NEUT38|And that's the case with a lot of our big rich companies.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
