NEUT0|"""Zabini John Miller, John."
NEUT1|Any thoughts for Dito?
NEUT2|I bought it at a very low price and gaining significant amount down since I don't need the money for now and still holding it, is it OK to hold it for the long term number one you have to ask yourself if Depot.
NEUT3|Is good for long term investing.
NEUT4|Hey so let me show you again.
NEUT5|Yeah, so John, if you're going to be a stock investor.
NEUT6|You have to buy companies that meet the GEMS criteria so you have to ask yourself.
NEUT7|Young Dito BA, is it in a growing industry?
NEUT8|Does it have earnings visibility?
NEUT9|This is does it have management credibility?
NEUT10|Cinnabon, decapitate Bunian, Kilamba marimba salon management credibility?
NEUT11|Do they have superior products?
NEUT12|And do they have a strong balance sheet?
NEUT13|So if the gems if the to the company meets the GEMS criteria, then.
NEUT14|I would say it is OK to hold for the long term, but if not then it would.
NEUT15|It might be better to send it already and take profit 'cause it's probably a stock trader company.
NEUT16|Istructe stock trading company so it is heavily traded.
NEUT17|High volume volatility damages miss about it so it is a very positive, very high volume.
NEUT18|So it's just for trading so again.
NEUT19|I'm not telling you what to do or say you have to decide for yourself.
NEUT20|Alright can say number one, if I will be also honest, I am not familiar with this criteria when it comes to details.
NEUT21|So in the columns in the path of balloon known company I don't know their balance sheet etc etc.
NEUT22|So I cannot answer your question if it is.
NEUT23|If it is good to hold for the long term so you have to do the research yourself.
BULL24|Alright, so I hope I was able to answer your question.
NEUT25|John yeah.
NEUT26|So see racial.
NEUT27|Then they know if the to the so called third echo will be good for long term investment.
NEUT28|So again Rachel you have to answer these questions yourself.
BULL29|Hey so Meron Bacillus strong balance sheet.
BULL30|Particularly after Asahina, your strong balance sheet.
NEUT31|Chicago Superior Products, an earnings visibility and very important if you plan to hold something for the long term, right?
