NEUT2|We're going to talk to Max Levchin on Squawk Alley later on this morning.
NEUT3|Jim pricing at 40 nine $12 billion valuation.
NEUT4|Peter Thiel, Vinod Khosla among the investors.
NEUT5|Market loves companies that are our Fintech now.
NEUT6|Fintechs been taking a backseat of late because people want to own some big big cap stocks, but that will end.
NEUT7|Here's what happens.
NEUT8|These are companies that people know our crunch numbers and are viewed as not having any real risk to them.
NEUT9|David, you know that when you make one of these fintech companies come true, it suddenly starts looking like visa.
NEUT10|Although Visa didn't get Plaid and I thought that you would have commented on that.
NEUT11|Well, the Department of Justice as you know, was opposed to the deal.
NEUT12|It was seen as really anticompetitive kind of capturing a potential rival in some way.
NEUT13|Jim, they were funny thinking they can get away with that.
NEUT14|Yeah I mean listen, it was a private.
NEUT15|People at large acquisition for them, but again, they do abandon that visa as you point out, that Plat acquisition with that with that opposition from the Department of Justice.

NEUT21|Mikes is great, but you know, people get people don't care if its fintech, by if he comes out on the showing says you know what we're looking at, taking a hard look at Bitcoin.
NEUT22|Then the stock takes another jump.
NEUT23|If he says he's going to look at all sort of crypto then it takes another one.
NEUT24|And if he's going after Quinn boys Coinbase, it doubles there.
NEUT25|That's the world right now that we're in and everyone likes it.
