NEUT0|"""This is how the stock market price of Coca Cola has behaved in the last few years."
NEUT1|I will show you with numbers how good or bad this is.
NEUT2|Top could be we will start analyzing the earnings per share of the last three years in 2018.
NEUT3|One point, $5 in 2019.
NEUT4|2.07 dollars and in 2020 so far one point $47, but it is estimated to finish the year with earnings per share of 1.89 dollars.
NEUT5|I have input this information in my software.
NEUT6|To calculate its intrinsic price.
NEUT7|Here I input the current market price of Coca Cola.
NEUT8|As you can see in the graph.
NEUT9|The market price follows the intrinsic price.
NEUT10|In the particular case of this stock.
NEUT11|If you expect an annual return of 6%.
NEUT12|The intrinsic price of this stock is 31 point, $5.
BULL13|55% overvalued.
BEAR14|If you expect a higher return to your investment, then the intrinsic price becomes lower.
NEUT15|This company has a debt of almost $53 billion.
NEUT16|With a debt to equity ratio of 2.48 dollars.
BULL17|Higher than what could we consider a good debt to equity ratio?
NEUT18|Considering that this is a famous company.
NEUT19|The stock market price is not very inflated.
BULL20|And I believe it could be a good stock to buy and hold with a decent return.
NEUT21|But you need to ask yourself how much more this company could grow worldwide.
NEUT22|People who bought Coca Cola stocks before the company expanded worldwide made a fortune.
NEUT23|But now I do not see much room for expansion.
NEUT24|However, I believe at the current market price this is talk is a low risk investment if you buy it and keep it for long.
NEUT25|However, you should perform additional research before taking any decision.
NEUT26|We will continue analyzing other stocks in future videos.
