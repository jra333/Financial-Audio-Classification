BEAR0|"""Does does Apple's presumed entry into this market spell real trouble for Tesla and its stock price?"
NEUT1|The time before I get into that, I need to start with a public service announcement.
NEUT2|I've been famously wrong at predicting Apple product 1 Apple product in the past, which is Apple TV and I learn a valuable lesson.
NEUT3|And that's what Apple is working on.
NEUT4|Doesn't necessarily mean that that product is going to see the light of day, and I'm reminded of that lesson over the last 24 hours.
NEUT5|So let's start from that point and then get to your question about the impact on the market.
NEUT6|Do I think that Apple eventually will have a car?
NEUT7|The answer is I don't know if they have a car or some other play in the autonomous space, whether it's a software licensing model.
NEUT8|I do believe that with the seven years of work that they've put into this, along with this massive addressable market that Josh outlined is $2 trillion market, I do believe that the company is going to pursue and eventually have something there, so the timing of this is difficult to predict.
NEUT9|The magnitude is measurable.
NEUT10|Just one last thought on this Tyler is that this $2 trillion market apples revenue next year is going to be $315 billion.
NEUT11|This is big enough for Apple to move the needle.
NEUT12|And I'm going to go all the way back to your question here.
NEUT13|What does it mean for the automotive industry?
NEUT14|For Tesla for the broader traditional OEM's an it is certainly trouble for traditional automakers, and Tesla is going to be the tale of two stories.
NEUT15|One is the fundamentals of the company and 2nd the stock.
NEUT16|I think it's going to different reactions.
NEUT17|So let me let me go back to your point that you began with, not the one about getting things wrong on Apple's products.
BEAR18|I've been wrong on him too.
NEUT19|I didn't see any reason for the iPad.
NEUT20|I didn't get it.
NEUT21|I didn't get it, but whatever.
NEUT22|So you basically lay out two scenarios here.
NEUT23|One is that Apple becomes a manufacturer of automobiles, either either with a partner or on its own.
NEUT24|The other is that it becomes a seller of technology and systems and an integrated.
NEUT25|Artificial intelligence and other things to auto manufacturers.
NEUT26|Which is the smarter way for Apple to go?
NEUT27|It would seem that the latter really is closer to their sweet spot.
NEUT28|Number one and #2 doesn't have all of the attendant risk of becoming a full scale automobile maker.
NEUT29|I was slightly different approach.
NEUT30|I think the former is the controlling the whole experience with the look and feel of a car is vertical integration of artificial intelligence, hardware, software services.
NEUT31|Doing the full stack.
NEUT32|I think that is Apple's violent Concerto and so that piece to me makes a lot of sense.
NEUT33|There's a dynamic to that.
NEUT34|We talked about manufacturing car actually is pretty easy.
NEUT35|Assembly is pretty easy.
NEUT36|It's being profitable at it's hard, so I think that they can do that.
NEUT37|I think there is a.
NEUT38|A dynamic at play here that is.
NEUT39|It's not a fun one to talk about, but I think that this weighs on Apple's decision about what the go to market is, and I think that is that cars can be dangerous.
NEUT40|It is something that the tech companies grab headlines when bad things happen in cars.
