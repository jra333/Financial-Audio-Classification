NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|And now we have a very well seen, well known pattern and I am trying to emphasize that because First off I don't want to come across like this is some sort of great discovery on my part and then I have some sort of special skill.
NEUT6|No nothing like that.
NEUT7|I assure you, people that use charts and understand charts have taken notice of this pattern and I go through all that because when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing called us up filling prophecy cover, you want it can produce some very dynamic movements and this pattern that we have here.
NEUT8|Is what is known.
NEUT9|I'm just going to draw it crudely here and then I'll talk about the levels but.
NEUT10|Known as a bear Pennant.
NEUT11|So that is the bear pendant that has taken shape and.
BEAR12|It is a bearish pattern.
NEUT13|Now the tricky part here is so it is a it's occurring in a bullish environment, though in terms of a trend and also just because there's a bearish pattern does not mean that for sure.
NEUT14|Guaranteed the prices going down.
NEUT15|If only trading were that easy.
NEUT16|If only you could say that's a bullish pattern.
BULL17|Therefore the price is going up.
BEAR18|Hey, that's a bearish pattern.
NEUT19|The price is going down takes a little bit more to it than that.
NEUT20|But my point here is a lot of people are going to be watching these levels and when a lot of people are watching the same levels and wondering the same thing, caught us up filling prophecy caught whatever you want.
NEUT21|It can definitely produce some very dynamic movements.
NEUT22|And like I said, that's what we have with this area and the level that a lot of people are going to be watching because the bottom portion of this pattern is that pink line there, that 200.
NEUT23|Simple moving average, currently valued at 1/12/25.
NEUT24|So that's going to be an area where if the price breaks below, there are no such thing as a guarantee.
NEUT25|My core point here is so it becomes a more than valid and rational thought that a break of 1/12/25 could very well create quite a bit of downward selling pressure, so that's certainly going to be an area that you're going to want to watch very closely.
NEUT26|But now if the price decides it wants to start to bounce back upwards.
NEUT27|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT28|Well, if the price bounces to the upside that main area of resistance that a lot of people will be watching is that purple line there?
NEUT29|The 50.
NEUT30|Moving average, which as you can see right there.
NEUT31|Is right where the price got rejected?
NEUT32|So I'm not saying that level can be broken, but that's certainly going to be a main area to watch moving into next week.
NEUT33|So 115 all that makes it easy.
NEUT34|One 1525 is the current value of that 50 per moving average key level of resistance and then 1/12/25 is the key level of support that pink line down there.
NEUT35|So let's see how the price behaves and continues to play out next week.
NEUT36|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT38|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL39|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR42|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT47|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
