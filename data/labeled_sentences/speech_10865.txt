NEUT0|"""You know it's a cliche in investing, they say oh by when you see blood on the streets."
NEUT1|The problem with buying when the when there's blood on the streets is that you're really scared at that time and it's not.
NEUT2|It doesn't feel like a good time to want to invest in anything risky.
NEUT3|And of course, that's what makes the opportunity.
NEUT4|What would you look for as a sign that you want to put money to work in risk?
NEUT5|Whether that's on the credit side, the high yield side equity side?
NEUT6|What is that look like?
NEUT7|Blood on the streets in the modern environment?
NEUT8|Sure, well, you know Joe?
NEUT9|That's a great question and valuation for me is always an important indicator.
NEUT10|But valuation is a poor timing tool.
NEUT11|If you look at where we are trading.
NEUT12|Relative on spreads of corporate debt high yield, it doesn't matter relative to.
NEUT13|Historical norms that is, you know what the excess return on a corporate bond would be relative to US.
NEUT14|Treasurys were already in the realm of being in the 10 only about 10 to 15% of the time.
NEUT15|Do bonds trade cheaper than we are today?
NEUT16|So that's a pretty good, you know that's a pretty good number for a long term investor to be considering putting money out the.
NEUT17|Of course, the overshoot almost always happens, which we did get, you know, in every recession, which I think we're in, so you know, it's probably a time to layer in that risk rather than to just wholesale jump in with both feet.
NEUT18|The stock market.
NEUT19|I'm a little more concerned about.
NEUT20|You know I I have in a real bear scenario getting to down, you know 50 to 55% from the top.
BEAR21|Wow, you know as we sit here today we're down 30.
NEUT22|You know, I, I think we are well less than 30.
BULL23|I think that there is going to be support here.
NEUT24|Just around 2400 on the S&P I think will go there for sure.
BEAR25|I think that if we break that support which is not very strong, support will be looking at a number closer to 2100, but ultimately you know we could go in in the worst case scenario we could go back to the old highs of the market.
NEUT26|Prior to the financial crisis, which would put us in the 1600 ZIP code.
NEUT27|So I'm not saying we're going there, right?
NEUT28|But it certainly makes me pause before I think about loading up on equities.
BULL29|I think we have an opportunity here.
NEUT30|"And if you want to play the game in equities, probably the thing to do is sell puts because fall is so high."""
