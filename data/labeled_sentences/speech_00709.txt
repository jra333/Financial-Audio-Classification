NEUT0|"""Today was a special day, not just because it's Friday and we have a weekend ahead of us because it was also the last day before Apple and Tesla split."
NEUT1|Now with each other, of course, but their stocks Apple going forward for one Tesla, always one better.
NEUT2|5 for one last two times.
NEUT3|Apple has done a stock split.
BULL4|It seen big gains a year down the line, so BK will history repeat itself.
BULL5|Study after study have shown stocks tend to gain five 8% from just a split a loan.
NEUT6|Yeah, which is insane because as everybody has said on this panel, there is no value added to the company because you split your stock.
NEUT7|But listen if people want to buy it and that seems to work.
NEUT8|You know there's an old trader saw that as soon as the stock gets to $90.00, usually $100 is the next stop and it's kind of acts like a magnet, so these kind of anomalies exist in markets.
NEUT9|I wouldn't go and bet the farm on this and it wouldn't even surprise me.
NEUT10|Is that once these things split people wake up and look at the rubber tap and go oh wait a second way I can buy a whole lot more.
NEUT11|Let me buy some more and you see this thing going before.
NEUT12|But again, it's not going to change the valuation of the story for the company.
BULL13|But hey, stock price might go up.
BULL14|Grasso yeah, I think you have the ability to.
NEUT15|I think you will start.
NEUT16|We were all really on the precipice or the cusp of seeing some rotation out of detecon out of growth.
NEUT17|I'm sorry, well out of Tekken into value and I think once Apple started with the split conversation and then Tesla piggyback, did it really put all of those plans of a rotation on hold?
NEUT18|I think what you're going to see now is maybe this won't be what history has shown us.
BULL19|Brian and maybe you get an opportunity to watch value and cyclicals start to perform on the cusp of what we could see.
NEUT20|Another rotation on the back of a pal.
BEAR21|"Had to stay yesterday as well."""
