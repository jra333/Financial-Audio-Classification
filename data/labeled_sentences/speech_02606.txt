NEUT0|"""Alright."
BULL1|The markets are celebrating today that the pound is surging.
BEAR2|Stock markets are rallying a bit also on the under the trade DealNews coming out of the US and China, but I think this very short sighted because in the longer run there are still lots of uncertainty.
BULL3|There will be long negotiations between the UK and the EU on the future trade agreement.
BEAR4|So I think this this cheerfulness today could very easily disappear.
NEUT5|This Brexit means only entering a transition period.
NEUT6|This is not the end of the relationship between the UK and the EU, so I think this is very so the the chances of no deal Brexit.
NEUT7|I've almost completely disappeared, but we will have these high uncertainties because this transition period only lasts until the end of 2020.
BEAR8|It's impossible to negotiate a trade deal with in only 11 months time, so the negotiations will probably last.
NEUT9|Until 2022, maybe 2025, and who knows, we might see quite a lot of elections in the UK until then.
BULL10|Now we've seen already a rally of the pound actually in in the run up to the elections.
BEAR11|We see another surge now it during Election night, which sounds extremely optimistic, so I would expect we will see really disappointments coming out of the UK economy, but we will see a further withdrawal of industrial activity out of the UK towards continental Europe.
NEUT12|There will be more uncertainty about what will be the situation of the City of London that is in financial services.
BEAR13|"So the UK economy will weaken, which means that we will see a weaker pound Sterling in the longer run."""
