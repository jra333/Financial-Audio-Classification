NEUT0|"""Hello guys, welcome back to the channel and today I wanted to show off some tradingview and see where the support lines are and where the resistance lines are for nano dimension."
NEUT1|As of right now for those who hold the stock, you already know that as of today Tuesday the 5th of January Nano Dimension is currently at 12 o'clock $8.79.
BULL2|The market overall is currently up and so is nano dimension.
BULL3|After our much needed Red Day, it's healthy to see some pullback and I'm glad to see that our stock is recovering a little bit because whenever we got down yesterday we were out like the low 850 is the low eight 40s and even after markets we were at the low eight 30s for a second.
BEAR4|I currently own 127 shares of Nano Dimension at an average cost of $8.56 and with the market being so red yesterday and nano being down so much.
NEUT5|I just I had to do it.
NEUT6|I literally I had to buy more.
NEUT7|I also want to say that this was the time to be very very greedy.
NEUT8|If you guys don't know there is a VIX.
NEUT9|Index orders a fear index and with such a chart it shows whenever people are very scared and what they're afraid of an we all know there.
BEAR10|As of right now there are elections going on in Georgia with Democrats and Republicans competing for seats.
NEUT11|And that is why.
BEAR12|And there's also multiple other reasons why the market was down yesterday.
NEUT13|And why Nano was down?
NEUT14|And that's kind of what I wanted to bring up in this video.
NEUT15|Should you buy in?
NEUT16|Should you hold or should you sell nano dimension?
NEUT17|And I'm tired of hearing this, but I need to tell you guys and I need to ask you guys, one simple question and this goes for every single stock.
NEUT18|Are you an investor or are you a gambler?
NEUT19|The reason why I bring it up is because a lot of people freak out whenever nano goes down and they start fearmongering they go.
BEAR20|Oh my God, I need to sell my positions.
BEAR21|Oh no, I'm so worried this is the end of the stock.
NEUT22|I'm just trying to make a quick Buck.
NEUT23|That's a gambler an it's someone who probably phone mode and here is what most of you are.
NEUT24|The people who stay tuned into my channel.
NEUT25|We are investors.
NEUT26|We believe in nano and we believe that it's going to grow over the years and we see the upside potential no matter the downs and no matter the UPS, if you really are an investor you should see today an yesterday as a buying opportunity because we know the fundamentals of the company.
NEUT27|I've made multiple videos on this company.
NEUT28|We know what's going to happen.
NEUT29|And we have our price targets, which is something I want to go into right now.
NEUT30|Now, as I said before, Nano Dimension is currently trading at $8.79 per share.
NEUT31|I've taken this as an opportunity to try to learn a little bit of tradingview and as you can see, we do have a support line in a resistance line that I've drawn up.
BEAR32|I've seen multiple support lines and I believe that 842 is feasable.
BEAR33|I've also noticed multiple attempts to break the resistance line at 962 and we have just for a short period but immediately dropped back down afterwards.
NEUT34|And I stand by my previous price target still for six to 12 months I could easily see the stock going to 50, maybe low 40s in for three months I could see the stock going to $20 per share and that's why I believe getting into the stock now while it's so low at $8.00.
NEUT35|Are you kidding me?
NEUT36|That's a steal, but that is going to wrap it up for this video.
BULL37|I hope you guys enjoyed.
