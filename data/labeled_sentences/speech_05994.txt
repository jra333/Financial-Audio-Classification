NEUT0|"""Here's a question that I get a lot from investors."
NEUT1|Hey Mitch, should I buy Facebook?
BEAR2|You know, the stock just had a big drop.
NEUT3|Maybe it's time to buy?
NEUT4|Well, maybe it is time to buy and then I get this.
NEUT5|Hey Mitch, should I buy Apple?
BULL6|Apple just became the first US company to reach a trillion dollar valuation.
BEAR7|That's a mind numbing number.
NEUT8|So the question is also should I buy stop?
NEUT9|Should I buy Twitter?
NEUT10|Should I buy Amazon, Netflix?
NEUT11|The list goes on.
NEUT12|The fact of the matter is I understand when somebody asks me.
NEUT13|By the way, I'm Mitch Goldberg with client for strategy.
NEUT14|I understand that when you're asking me this, you're really looking for a yes or no answer.
NEUT15|No, I don't mean to make what seems like a simple question to you more complicated beneath the surface, but maybe you know you should buy it in an IRA.
NEUT16|Maybe you should buy it in a taxable account, whatever that stock maybe.
NEUT17|Maybe you have a ton of that stock already in your exchange traded funds and your mutual funds, and in your 401K there are a lot of things that need to be looked at your risk tolerance.
NEUT18|Your time horizon, how much you can afford to invest.
NEUT19|So when somebody asks me these questions if if a client asks me this should I buy Facebook?
NEUT20|I have an answer because I know their situation.
NEUT21|I know how much they have in technology, for example, which is a huge part of the market right now and your typical ETF and mutual fund is probably stuffed right now with tech stocks like Amazon, Facebook, Netflix alphabet, etc.
NEUT22|So the question is should you should you buy the stock.
NEUT23|It takes a little bit more discovery.
NEUT24|Well, actually a lot more discovery to give you the answer that you're looking for.
BULL25|I hope this helps, and I hope you understand why that.
NEUT26|If you're a friend of mine and you're watching this right now and you've asked me recently, should you buy Apple or Facebook, I hope you understand why the answer really is, hey, give me a call.
NEUT27|We'll talk about it and we'll decide if it's the right move or not for you.
BULL28|"Thanks for watching."""
