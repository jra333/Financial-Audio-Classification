NEUT0|"""What's up everybody and happy Wednesday."
NEUT1|Listen, I'm looking to pick up some Disney tomorrow.
NEUT2|Because you know what?
NEUT3|Just like baby Yoda, Disney is green baby and you know what?
NEUT4|It's probably because we got some Mulan coming out.
NEUT5|Got the Mandalorian Season 2 coming out.
BULL6|I mean, come on now we're still pretty messed up and Disney is fighting back and they're going and they're climbing alright?
NEUT7|And that's just because they have their online service and you know the parks that they're still not doing great but.
NEUT8|Who doesn't want to go to Disney Park so?
NEUT9|I'm going to see what I pick up tomorrow once the market opens, I feel very, very good about Disney.
BULL10|So alright guys, take care again.
NEUT11|Do whatever you want with your money.
NEUT12|Please don't listen to anyone online.
NEUT13|"And before you go like, comment and subscribe, take care."""
