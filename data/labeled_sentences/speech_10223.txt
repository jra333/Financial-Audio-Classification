NEUT0|"""Here's the opening Bell guys in the S&P 500 at the bottom of your screen at the big board today."
NEUT1|It's Vanek celebrating the launch of the van Eck vectors social sentiment ETF ticker buzz, which you've no doubt heard about by now at the NASDAQ it's senior care provider, Innovage Jim.
NEUT2|You did say this morning that ETF fascinates you will look it's done by an algorithm, does not have GameStop in it, by the way, but it's all the chatter stocks and I had this image of the people we've not mentioned these people of late.
NEUT3|The Wallstreetbets people saying, you know what?
NEUT4|This is our group and we're going to start buying Buzz Dave Portnoy.
NEUT5|Yes, it very interesting video.
NEUT6|It's rated X or whatever people rate people you know you rated so that you can't really watch it.
NEUT7|Lot of it, but this is the first ETF that's captured my fancy in along time, simply because I want to watch what people really are talking about, and it's done in a very non emotional way.
BULL8|So Carl, I think it's a winning ETF in part because, yes, the hardest working man in stock.
NEUT9|In sports business and he does have a lip sync by the way, from James Brown.
BULL10|Today is behind it, and Portnoy will generate a lot of excitement.
BULL11|The ETF is very exciting.
NEUT12|Tanger will you look at that?
NEUT13|See if Steve's come back to me.
NEUT14|It's one of my just greatest guess it look at that.
NEUT15|Tell us that stop being shorted for.
NEUT16|I mean you can't bet against Steve Tanger.
BULL17|He's one of the best in the world, but they're doing it well.
NEUT18|I understand why you might short it as a sort of a basket of shorts in general.
NEUT19|Part of it, right?
NEUT20|In short, it six months ago when he was really on the ropes, but maybe they were.
NEUT21|Well, no, last six months ago they weren't doing well, but no one saying maybe washer now.
NEUT22|I mean, you're going to start to cover here, but you're saying this thing is also now getting getting.
NEUT23|Well they picked it, they did.
NEUT24|Yeah they picked it.
BEAR25|'cause of the short position baby in the registry.
NEUT26|They read it well.
NEUT27|I don't think this can do rocket Mark because no rocket has unbelievable quarter didn't understand at all why that stock was down tangers just not as bad as we thought, but they've picked it because of the short position and David, you know I don't like this kind of investing if only just because if it's just you know, 3040% short and that's something I know.
NEUT28|Meanwhile Gamestops hanging in there at $124 a share.
NEUT29|Look at that list.
NEUT30|We that's the real time list.
NEUT31|The channel list, yeah, but we got buzz and I think we're going to follow bars because it's about what it's the stocks that we all talk about an I don't know.
NEUT32|It's kind of interesting to see an algo pick the stocks and yet the average does not have GameStop because the algo is not up to date.
NEUT33|They need GameStop in that thing.
NEUT34|Carl, we have still not heard from GameStop, which I think is rather amazing.
NEUT35|They have nothing to say.
BEAR36|It's getting weird.
NEUT37|Yeah it is.
BEAR38|It's getting weird, Jim.
NEUT39|The silence is deafening.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
