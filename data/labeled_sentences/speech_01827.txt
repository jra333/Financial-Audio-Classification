NEUT0|Can I buy stock before the market opens?
NEUT1|The exact time window during which you can buy or sell stocks in the premarket session depends on your broker.
NEUT2|A few brokerages don't offer premarket trading at all.
NEUT3|The NASDAQ allows premarket trading as early as 4:00 AM ET so there are many possible time windows brokerages can offer.
