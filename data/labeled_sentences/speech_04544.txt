NEUT0|"""Josh, what is your last chance trade?"
NEUT1|I'm going to throw Amazon at you look.
NEUT2|This is the type of stuff that you hear over and over again from people.
NEUT3|They say if it ever pulls back I'm going to buy that thing.
NEUT4|I can't believe I missed it.
NEUT5|I've been listening to that for I don't know.
NEUT6|18 years from people or 20 years so this is what I would tell you.
BEAR7|It is now 15% off its high does not look great right now.
BULL8|However, it's sitting just above historical support.
NEUT9|This is where I would take a shot.
NEUT10|I would put a stop loss in just below that support level.
NEUT11|Let's say 1660.
BEAR12|1670 you're risking somewhere between 3 and 5% on the trade.
NEUT13|You're going to know if you're wrong.
BULL14|Very quickly you're going to be taken out of this trade with a very minor loss, but if you're right and this thing heads back up toward the highs and it follows what we just saw with Alphabet with Apple.
BULL15|With Microsoft, this is a good opportunity to buy it.
NEUT16|You're not buying it at a peak, and there's a lot of skepticism right now about whether or not Amazon is doing as well against its competitors as it once was.
NEUT17|Fun fact, this is probably the first year in a long time.
NEUT18|That Amazon has a sub S&P 500 year to date return and then look at the year to date, return and Target in Costco in Walmart.
NEUT19|These were left for dead names a year and a half ago.
BULL20|"What a what a big turn around we've seen, so I think there's an opportunity here from the long side for a stock that you may have missed for awhile, alright?"""
