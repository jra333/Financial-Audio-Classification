NEUT0|"""Yeah, look, I think not."
NEUT1|Not worried at all.
NEUT2|This is a normalization.
BULL3|It seems very likely that 10 year yields will go up significantly more easily.
NEUT4|I would think breaking the 1 1/2% level there may well be just a taking of breath in equity markets as that happens, but fundamentally this is a normalization.
BULL5|It's a sign of growth, it's healthy.
NEUT6|If we look at the forward yield on the S&P Giles, it's only 1 1/2% if we get the 10 year Treasury yield beyond 1 1/2 percent.
NEUT7|What are the implications for the S&P?
NEUT8|An interest in owning equities?
NEUT9|I think to my mind the normality is equities.
NEUT10|Your total return is based on dividends and of course on future capital growth and therefore it's completely normal that you you have a a lower a lower dividend yield.
BULL11|You can still have a a higher potential total return on equities, so as I say I think as you have that kind of crossover.
NEUT12|Yes, I think the equity market.
NEUT13|We'll take breath.
BULL14|There certainly can be a modest set back, and in fact, last week you saw a little bit of that.
NEUT15|In in stock markets, Ann and I think the other thing is clearly Trump quote.
NEUT16|Out of the growth stocks into the into the value stocks didn't really happen.
NEUT17|Maybe there is a bit more of that coming up.
BEAR18|Maybe the tech stocks do pause for breath themselves and do underperform the general market a little bit.
BEAR19|We heard that news about Caterpillar as an example of a stock that will clearly benefit from recovery, so I think that's all part of the story here, but the idea that there's going to be a really major reset of equity prices, I just don't buy it.
BULL20|The trending stocks is still up for this year.
NEUT21|Johns though as we talk about some normalization, there's a fear out there that you have seen pockets of bubbles, whether that's in the crypto space from Bitcoin to the specs of these special vehicles were using listings take place.
NEUT22|Do you think some parts of these these markets away from the technology thing where we have seen that rapid acceleration as well?
NEUT23|Do you think Bitcoin Inspecs could see some impact if there's a sort of letting out of the hot air or the excess in markets around this normalization phase?
NEUT24|In in crypto and Bitcoin, it's quite natural to have setbacks of 1020% bitcoins.
BEAR25|Already seen that once this year and highly likely will get that kind of temporary set back again, but I would not see that breaking the trend.
BULL26|I think the trend in Bitcoin remains strongly upwards, and that's all to do with greatly increased institutional interest, which has been.
BULL27|Very big these last several months, but is still only just beginning.
NEUT28|There are lots and lots of institutional investors still who want to get into Bitcoin and I think when you do get those small setbacks in response to it to perhaps a little bit of concern about the higher rate interest rates, you will actually see that being used as a buying opportunity.
NEUT29|"And again, I think Bitcoin in the year from now."""
