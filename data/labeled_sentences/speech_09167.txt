NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart, ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, quite the rough day.
NEUT5|Today.
BEAR6|To be fair, the markets as a whole had rough day, so it's not like the markets were booming and then Apple had this sort of day but very bearish an.
NEUT7|Updates in be made for his little house cleaning.
NEUT8|Just get delete those lines out.
NEUT9|Sure, they pretend they're just not relevant right now and from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing confusion 'cause there's lines area look, so let's try to keep this as clean as possible moving forward.
NEUT10|But one of those areas of support that a lot of people are going to be watching moving forward, and rightfully so.
NEUT11|It's a relatively historic level is right down here at $120.85.
NEUT12|If you go through the history of the chart you can see this area acted as a resistance right there.
NEUT13|There's a foundational rule in China which states when levels of resistance are broken.
NEUT14|You want to see the map that support, and that's exactly what happened.
NEUT15|There acted as support and then exactly what happened later on in the day today acted as support.
NEUT16|So does that mean that one 2085 is guaranteed to hold?
NEUT17|Nothing's guaranteed.
BULL18|I'm just saying that that's definitely going to be a very watched level in a very important area of support.
NEUT19|Now if that level does not hold up, the next level of support that it will be very watch is going to be that pink line there.
NEUT20|And the reason why it's going to be very watches that pink line represents a very well known a very famous level in the world charts that 200.
NEUT21|Moving average.
NEUT22|Even if you have a basic understanding of technical analysis, I'm sure you've heard the 200.
NEUT23|Moving average before.
NEUT24|And that is what that, again, the pink line is representing current value of that.
NEUT25|Let's just call it the $120.00 Mark, so one 2085 and then 120 going to key levels of support now in the event the price decides it wants to just turn itself around and work its way back upwards.
BEAR26|Key area resistance at that point.
NEUT27|Is going to be all about that purple line there.
NEUT28|The 50.
NEUT29|Moving average currently valid at $123.50 so watch that.
NEUT30|But as of now, in my opinion at least top priority is not necessarily breaking levels of resistance.
NEUT31|It's more so about trying to stabilize out here, so let's see if the price can at least start to get some sideways price movement moving forward.
NEUT32|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL35|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT40|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
