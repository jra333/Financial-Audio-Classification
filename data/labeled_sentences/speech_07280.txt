NEUT5|Let's begin.
NEUT6|Julio is a company from United States with a market cap of 64 billion.
NEUT7|It's a growth stock and pays no dividends.
NEUT8|The revenue have grown for the last years with a growth rate of 55%, and because this is a growth company and they need a lot of money for growing, they have no organs.
NEUT9|Now let's take a look at the balance sheet.
NEUT10|The total assets are 9.4 million, from which 900,000,000 is cash on hand, and the total liabilities are 1 billion.
BULL11|And they have no debt, and that's a good sign.
NEUT12|And also on the short term, there is no problem with the liabilities.
BULL13|The current assets are 3.3 billion and current liabilities are 1 billion, so they have a strong balance sheet with no debt.
BULL14|The revenues growing rebar here.
BEAR15|The only problem is profitability.
NEUT16|They have no earnings.
NEUT17|No, they see their products and their customers and then I'll show you the competition.
NEUT18|And finally, if this stock is overvalued or undervalued.
NEUT19|There are many products are for voice and video messaging, authentification and connected devices and also they provide solution for account security based marketing, collaboration and contact center.
NEUT20|To summarize, they have a cloud platform where developers can make custom communication into Leo, charge money for users, messages, calls or subscription.
NEUT21|The 10 top customers for 2020 represents 13% from revenue.
NEUT22|They have different clients like Airbnb, Shopify, Uber, Instacart, Netflix.
NEUT23|Netflix relies on too low to keep user updated to real time account notifications.
NEUT24|And also they have banks like Morgan Stanley and ING.
NEUT25|And 27% of revenue comes from international for 2020 and the rest from USA.
NEUT26|Now let's see the competition because this plays an important role.
BEAR27|The first competitor is what in system before market cap of 3.4 billion and they have low earnings compared with the revenue 1.3 billion.
BEAR28|The problem of these companies that they have too much debt and the price is very overvalued.
NEUT29|They also have a platform with different services for communication.
NEUT30|The second competitor is Monash Holdings, with a market cap of three million.
NEUT31|They provide cloud communications services for businesses and consumers.
BEAR32|The problem is that they have no earnings for the last two years and they have a lot of debt.
NEUT33|And the last competitor is nice with a market cap of 14 billion, they have earnings and load it.
NEUT34|So this is a really nice company.
NEUT35|So a strong competitor for Studio is nice, but they have different services.
NEUT36|And just for some of them will be a competition.
NEUT37|No, Julio is still about this moment.
BULL38|Just in the last year this took almost tripled, but not based on fundamental, just an expectation that they will do great in the future.
NEUT39|And if you want to invest in this talk, you have to be aware because there is a big risk to lose your money now.
BEAR40|The stock price is very overvalued.
BEAR41|It might continue to grow on future expectations, but if this expectation won't be then the stock price will fall.
NEUT42|So this depends on you if you like safety then wait or look for something better.
NEUT43|And if you like the risk based on expectation that everything will be great in the future, then you can take the risk.
NEUT44|And if you want to find the stock that is a buy right now, you can watch my analysis about Vertex Pharmaceuticals and also my previous video about Crowd Strike, a cybersecurity company.
