BEAR0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the answer P. 500 and you can see that we have pulled bank just a bit during the Globex session, only to turn around an rally."
BULL1|The 3150 level is likely to be tested and if we can break above there we could go to.
NEUT2|3200 and then possibly 3400.
NEUT3|The 50 day Ma continues to.
NEUT4|Offer support between there and 200.
NEUT5|I think at this point in time it's only a matter of time before dips are bunt.
NEUT6|Remember the Federal Reserve is there to keep Wall Street profitable and they will do that regardless of the jobs number.
BEAR7|"I would look at any knee jerk reaction to the downside as a potential buying opportunity unless it's just so horrific that it completely shocks Wall Street and I just don't see how that happens."""
