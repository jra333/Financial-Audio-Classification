NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, Mike Saint Amour here, also known as precise 26 from traders-circle.com an right now I'm looking at the goldan we're looking at the shorter term, the one hour chart because that's what's at play right now."
BEAR1|I'm looking at this support area here that has been broken.
NEUT2|We are now moving downward.
BEAR3|We are making a lower highs and lower lows Anwer, channeling downwards so we are in a bearish trend for the short to mid term.
BULL4|Zooming in, we can see we just broke support.
NEUT5|That's the strategy.
NEUT6|Buy on the breaks down or sell on the breaks down.
NEUT7|Sorry so.
BEAR8|Take profit could be around here for the short term, but I suspect we're going fairly low here yet.
NEUT9|We're going to go to maybe 302, maybe even 300.
NEUT10|We'll see how that goes, but this is going to be a nice little drop for people to enjoy.
NEUT11|I'm just looking at the Mac D, we can see is download.
BEAR12|Sorry this is the 30 minute one hour here Makde starting to drop here.
BEAR13|OK so we got the RVI, which is splitting and possibly starting to turn down.
BEAR14|We are just pretty much below 0 which is a good thing for the Bears.
BEAR15|Looking at the RSI an RSI and MFI we can see they are definitely in bearish country so.
BULL16|Everything looks good for the bear.
NEUT17|As for a position, I think it's a little late for a position.
NEUT18|Right now there's not really much you can do well.
NEUT19|I mean, you could go now, but it's a little late.
NEUT20|You should have went a little higher here, but I guess it's OK to short right now.
NEUT21|This would be an OK opportunity, but just be careful and I think that's all I can say for gold right now.
NEUT22|Seeing that this is a short to mid term move, so we're just going to have to watch this little channel right here and see where it goes from there.
BULL23|Hopefully this was helpful.
