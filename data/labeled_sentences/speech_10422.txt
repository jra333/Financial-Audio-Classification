BEAR0|"""Hello everyone, let's take the Apple stock with we can see here today it has formed another red candle and this radical has dropped down below the first year my line and stuck between the two lines and shows very small and weakness for the momentum especially for the volume is very low so there's no distribution yet so we can see in this area is still consolidation is still possible for Apple to go higher from here because here is very likely."
NEUT1|The period, all here.
NEUT2|Whenever we find a jump from the volume will see.
NEUT3|It will begin a new trend.
NEUT4|So let's wait and see.
NEUT5|But do not learn the stock too early from here because there's still no sign of the breakout.
