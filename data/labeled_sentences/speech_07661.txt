BEAR0|"""Everybody is treating Warren Buffett."
NEUT1|As the financial guru, he has always been and they analyze.
NEUT2|What he said in his last stockholder meeting, and they analyze what he said.
NEUT3|Like he's an agile 50 year old.
NEUT4|Well, Warren Buffett is 89 years old.
NEUT5|You compare his 2020 annual meeting.
NEUT6|The way he speaks.
NEUT7|To wait, he speaks in his last.
BEAR8|Videos around five years ago, there's a definite decline.
NEUT9|People are not taking into consideration that Warren Buffett is a human being.
NEUT10|Who may be in decline mentally?
NEUT11|Right now, nothing against Warren Buffett for that.
NEUT12|But you have to consider the man is not going to be sharp until he's 120 years old.
NEUT13|Well, he may have symptoms of mental decline already, yet no ones taking that into account and trying to make decisions on what Warren Buffett is doing.
NEUT14|I have Berkshire Hathaway stock.
NEUT15|The B stock.
NEUT16|But I just have it is.
NEUT17|For fun I don't have a big investment, it's just a fun investment that I got because I wanted something different.
NEUT18|But it keeps me aware of Buffett.
BEAR19|I think he's a mental decline.
NEUT20|"Nothing wrong with that, but that's what comes with age."""
