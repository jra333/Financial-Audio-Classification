BEAR0|"""Hi, I'm Alan Farley and this is one minute trade was a tough September and setting up as a tough October and the best trade should be on the short side."
NEUT1|I like Disney as a short sale and I'll show you why.
NEUT2|Thank you.
NEUT3|Look at the daily chart.
BEAR4|You can see that plunge from about $42 down to 30 in August.
BEAR5|That was a 15 month low.
BULL6|The stock send wound its way back up to about $34.00 with a rally failed at the end of August.
BEAR7|It's been drifting lower and undercut the low the August load.
NEUT8|Just about two weeks ago and then.
BEAR9|Top tier now as it comes back to that low about 29 to 2950, the stock will complete an inverse Cup and handle pattern which is very bearish for a breakdown that could get this stock down to about $25.
NEUT10|I'm moving into the 60 minute chart.
BEAR11|You can see that August low right around 2915 that undercut the 29.
NEUT12|How we could get one last bounce up to that Upper Blue line running about 3232.
NEUT13|Fifty aggressive traders can sell short there with tight stops you for not an aggressive trader and you want to make sure that things are moving in your favor.
BEAR14|"Wait until it gets back down to about 29 and breaks out low and then taking momentum short for ASL all the way down to about $25."""
