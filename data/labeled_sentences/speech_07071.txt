NEUT0|"""Is skinny and a weekly top 50 welcome back?"
NEUT1|Is that it off every 2021?
NEUT2|Wednesday, the day after we were #24 theater network with the ticker the top.
NEUT3|So what Oggins BT BT BT C data is not eat ice data.
BULL4|So potato against BTC we are in again consolidation.
NEUT5|I like what I see.
NEUT6|I like what I see.
NEUT7|This is a symmetrical triangle is coming on for theater organs.
NEUT8|We see the only question we have is are we going to drop a little bit lower first before we continue higher or are we just going to start rising up from here?
NEUT9|Or are we just going to become some other kind of chart pattern?
NEUT10|We don't know?
BULL11|But anyway, if we do complete a symmetrical triangle, more likely than not, the direction should be up.
NEUT12|And if we do plus up 40 targets, BDC the targets are.
NEUT13|9050 and 10,500, so this is quite a lot, actually more than 100%, about 47% for target number, one an about 72% fall target #2.
NEUT14|So there are two targets out of the oven, fresh for you.
NEUT15|40 targets BBC whether we need it or not, again is another story by itself, so I think more likely than not that it could be in some sort of a consolidation.
NEUT16|Here you know there could be some more downs before we see any more ups and so.
BEAR17|Anyway, we are biased bullish for Teeter against BTC, and we have two toilets fresh out of the oven to potentially potentially rising up.
NEUT18|Yeah, for you, right?
NEUT19|So there you go.
NEUT20|We want to target USD T. But before that, please give this video a like.
NEUT21|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to our channel and let me know what you think about data in the comments below.
BEAR22|Again, even for data against USD, we are in a consolidation.
NEUT23|Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
BULL24|We are in a proper consolidation for Theta and.
BULL25|Once we are done with the consolidation, we are going to be pumping higher.
NEUT26|How much higher that are?
NEUT27|Another two targets fresh out of the oven for you.
NEUT28|Can you smell?
NEUT29|It is fresh so the two targets are 3.15 at Target number one in three point.
NEUT30|Sorry 4.114 number 2.
NEUT31|40% away to 184% away target #2 over strange feeling if you can go up to $4.
NEUT32|More likely than not the wheels of data we're going to be aiming for five freaking dollars.
NEUT33|I told him we're going to stop at 4:11 if we were to go up to 411.
BULL34|I think we're going to go closer to $5, so watch out for that.
BULL35|I think data will continue.
BULL36|It's a bullish run.
BEAR37|Data has been super bullish ever since.
NEUT38|Breaking way back on the 25th of April 2020.
NEUT39|And it just never stopped right?
NEUT40|So if we were to assume hundred data.
NEUT41|Is on a five wave move towards the upside right?
NEUT42|This is going to be a with one we retrace, or with two were up for up with tree possibly hitting followers, maybe even five.
NEUT43|We retraced Laura with four and then we go offer up with by bringing this to potentially 10 freaking dollars.
NEUT44|So there you go.
BULL45|I think big things are coming for data and the direction of those big things are actually up for data both on usdan against BTC is looking pretty.
NEUT46|Ricky and we like what we see alright.
NEUT47|I guess it from my technical analysis.
BULL48|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL49|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT50|"I shall see you in the next video."""
