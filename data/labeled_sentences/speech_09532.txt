BULL0|"""CTRM stock everybody welcome, so we're going to talk about CRM stock."
NEUT1|It's currently at 0.94.
BULL2|It went up on Friday 0.45%.
BEAR3|It's consolidating here in this area of 0.9.
BULL4|Basically for the past week or so it went up a little bit over $1.00 during last week, but it pulled back.
BEAR5|I'm a little bit concerned about CTR.
NEUT6|M disclaimer.
NEUT7|I have a nice position in it and this the Castle here is kind of concerning for me.
NEUT8|The red is crossed the purple.
BEAR9|Which usually means that there's going to be a flippin the trend and this could be meaning a downtrend for us.
BEAR10|And and hopefully that we won't get to this area.
NEUT11|I would really want to see the 0.845 area about here if that would be an area that would hold us as a support or the 0.75 which is where we gapped up here.
NEUT12|That would be another support area.
NEUT13|Maybe I'll draw that so I have it.
NEUT14|0.75 area that would be another support area you can see.
NEUT15|Also we had here this area here which was on the zero point area.
NEUT16|The area down here.
NEUT17|So that's going to be an interesting area to see if the stack will dip down to this area.
NEUT18|Canicon can it bounce off of it and then retrace to the one area 'cause one area is a huge resistance for this talk is going to be interesting to see if going next week.
BEAR19|There's enough volume 'cause the volume was super super low here.
NEUT20|So it's going to have to break out, have some more volume, look how much volume we had in this area right here.
NEUT21|And now.
NEUT22|There's almost basically no volume since then.
BEAR23|So as you can see how much volume we had in this area, and now it's really really significantly declined.
NEUT24|And and it seems that there's really no interest in the stock.
BEAR25|Basically, the volume has significantly gone down, and because of that there's a little bit of a little bit of movement because there's no buying in no selling, just really low volume.
NEUT26|Tire size right in the middle so not too over, but not too oversold and the stochastic all the blue is under the yellow.
BEAR27|We're in a really icky downtrend and you can see here all these red candles here, so it's it's not looking great.
BULL28|Hopefully we can turn around.
BULL29|They have lot of ships that they bought recently from the rise in the price of the stock and stock offering so they were able to get a lot of money and then now they are in prime position to start becoming profitable.
BEAR30|So this might turn into a mid.
NEUT31|Size play to one year play.
NEUT32|Maybe we'll have to see, but if we look at just just as a swing a swing currently, I wouldn't get into this position.
NEUT33|If you're looking for a swing trade for, let's say a week or two, I think there could be a little bit of consolidation even more, but hopefully I'm wrong and it will pop up.
