NEUT0|"""How concerned are you about the coronavirus situation?"
NEUT1|Warn well, you gotta defer to the doctors on that, but.
NEUT2|You know you get all these figures about awful, regularly kills you, know 20 times as many people in this country is 40 times maybe as much as we've seen in the way of death.
NEUT3|Even more than that, but.
NEUT4|You know it is a pandemic.
NEUT5|I mean, I don't know exactly what the dictionary definition is, but when you have something that's in China and Korea and Italy and.
NEUT6|Around, I mean it's it would meet my definition of a pandemic.
NEUT7|It's something that and it's.
NEUT8|No one knows the duration or dimensions of it.
NEUT9|Now you can't know at this point and what you do know.
NEUT10|Is that the dimensions?
NEUT11|Have changed since a few months ago.
NEUT12|They haven't changed in in terms of the possible worst case, but they but the best case is moving over in that.
BULL13|It's spread and you know it'll ease them.
NEUT14|I've got example.
NEUT15|I mean, it is really spread, so we've got something that we don't know how long it will be with us.
NEUT16|We don't know how severe it will be, but.
NEUT17|There will be uncertainty about that for a considerable period of time.
NEUT18|There has to be what precautions are you taking personally?
NEUT19|Or if you change your habits while I'm drinking a little more.
NEUT20|Coca Cola actually seems to Ward it off everything else in life.
NEUT21|I mean, I've 89 I'm in, I just had had.
BULL22|Two different doctors told me how many much better shape than I was a few years ago.
NEUT23|I'm not sure what I'm doing to get in better shape, but by accident.
NEUT24|I mean I had an annual heart check where I wear something around my waist.
NEUT25|First couple of the guy said mine.
NEUT26|It's never been better so.
NEUT27|But no, I really.
NEUT28|I'ma probabilities guided by nature.
NEUT29|So I you know I gotta be two 2.8 million deaths this year and at age 18 I have a little more likely to be that was in that group, but 2,000,000 eight, you know and.
NEUT30|What we had so far?
BULL31|I mean it, it it will grow, but.
NEUT32|In terms of changing my life, I haven't really changed it, but I could work at home easily and so could.
NEUT33|People may have you thought about doing that?
NEUT34|Well, not yet.
NEUT35|No, I, but.
NEUT36|"My doctor does tell me don't don't do a lot of traveling in the big crowds and everything but, but I have one trip scheduled on, but I'm not changing it."""
