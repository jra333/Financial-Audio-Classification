NEUT0|"""Welcome back, it's 18th of August 2020, Tuesday, the 2nd day of the week."
NEUT1|So where we are envisioning number 19 with the ticker BETV changes to the top 20 coin.
BULL2|So good job on that anyway, Sunny Lu.
NEUT3|Let's check out with teaching his BBC.
NEUT4|Yeah so so so for Vechain against PC.
BULL5|Needs a good trade for us.
NEUT6|We call to sakes.
BULL7|It went up to close to the top year.
NEUT8|We of course obviously we don't.
NEUT9|You know this is really very close to the top.
NEUT10|Yeah, we knew we knew but we had a inkling of where things would probably stop and eventually it did stop at where we expect it to stop and so.
NEUT11|Hippie GBC so right now for vision against BTC.
BEAR12|We're in a correction.
BEAR13|This is a very deep correction to her from the very top to the very bottom.
NEUT14|Here we collected 4343%.
BEAR15|It's quite a lot to do, so it feels to me like potentially could drop even lower here, which in my opinion is a very good move right here.
NEUT16|This would actually constitute five weeks.
NEUT17|1234 We Follower 5 waves.
NEUT18|If you can fall towards the support you even better, but it's very important that we do not cross this keeping claimed a moment.
NEUT19|You touch a single plane.
BEAR20|Potentially we could be making preparations to drop even lower from Vechain against BTC.
BEAR21|There will be a very, very sad day if it happens, it's just that one time we still don't know what's happening for beach.
NEUT22|And yes, there's just no clear patterns yet, and so we're being very, very cautious about jumping into a trick for Vijay too soon, alright?
NEUT23|So let's move on to the chain against USD T or before that, please give this video like you enjoyed it.
NEUT24|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about the chain in the comments below for rich against USD T. OK, let me tell you something.
BEAR25|This is not good idea.
BEAR26|Double bearish divergences I think.
NEUT27|I told you this last week, did I know, but it's a.
BEAR28|Higher high margin, just marginally higher high on the price, but lower high on demand deep lower high under RSI, so this is a double bearish.
BEAR29|Divergance double Q so potentially we could be dropping down towards the resistance.
NEUT30|I mean sorry the support line over here way back at 1 Cent we're almost at 2 cents.
NEUT31|We're having around two cents.
NEUT32|Actually at this point of time, so the danger.
NEUT33|Stranger Danger, Danger data.
BEAR34|We could be dropping towards 1 cent so you will be another 45 percent 45%.
NEUT35|It's a lot so the danger is there so be very very careful about going to a trip too soon.
NEUT36|You should not be entering trades when things are overbought, right?
NEUT37|I mean I would not be entering.
NEUT38|It is up to you though if you want to enter but for me no, no no.
NEUT39|I'm not going to be doing things like that 'cause this is a very very high risk move, because.
NEUT40|You know when things were bought, some more likely than not.
NEUT41|So there should be a deep correction coming in will become.
BEAR42|I don't know right now, things are feeling very bullish for Bitcoin.
BEAR43|We're still feeling very bullish.
NEUT44|And so if you see me like, are there still more upside to come for Vechain against USD so?
BULL45|I I still don't know whether if this is going to continue any higher, not even if you do continue any higher, we might get a triple Berry divergance.
NEUT46|There will be even even stronger signing that things could be reversing for Vechain against USD T. So be very careful about going into a trip to soon.
NEUT47|Alright, so I guess it from my vision technical analysis.
BULL48|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL49|Hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT50|"I just see you in the next video."""
