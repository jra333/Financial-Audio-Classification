NEUT0|"""Mark Zandi, chief economist with Moody's Analytics Mark Why is it good?"
BEAR1|Well, you know the pandemic is still raging.
NEUT2|It's not over.
BEAR3|The economy is still very weak.
BEAR4|Unemployment and underemployment very high.
BEAR5|So still a lot of financial stress, particularly for renters.
NEUT6|People that are generally lower income minority groups who have really gotten hit hard by the pandemic and on top of that, there's a lot of funds render assistance.
NEUT7|That's coming to landlords and tenants.
NEUT8|25 billion was appropriated with the December really package, and another 21 billion plus with the American rescue plan, so that's almost 50 billion in total.
BULL9|That's just going to take a little bit of time to get out there, so I think the three month extension is just enough time to get that money out and to get on the other side of pandemic so.
NEUT10|By the end of the end of June, when this particular extension expires, I think we're sitting in a pretty good place and the moratoriums could end at that point, but more.
NEUT11|What's to be done about that effect that Diana Olick was just telling us about harder to buy because of reduced inventory of properties?
BEAR12|Because renters that are buying them when they can, and harder to rent because landlords have been squeezed during this.
NEUT13|Might have tighter standards is there?
NEUT14|Is there a policy response that should work there?
BEAR15|I think these are temporary problems.
NEUT16|Issues that you know.
BULL17|I do think the you know the housing market is very strong.
BULL18|The rental market is strong in most places and I think once we get on the other side of the pandemic in that rental assistance gets out to the landlord and the tenant will be in a much better place.
NEUT19|So I don't think this is going to be a longer term issue.
NEUT20|I mean, it's important to point out that no, obviously you don't have moratoriums like this except in.
NEUT21|You know, under, XD, back, exigent circumstances as the Fed would say under real under real crisis, so that you know this is something very extraordinary.
BULL22|But we, you know, we've been through in a very extraordinary time.
BULL23|But I do think you know a few months down the road I will be no much better place and people will be feeling a lot better about things.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
