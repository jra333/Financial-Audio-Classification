NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to another technique and analysis video."
NEUT1|Here's exam.com.
NEUT2|It's Friday, November 6 and Christina Bethany investment analyst taking a look at the US versus the Canadian dollar in the daily chart.
BEAR3|Well, it has been negative week for the dollar with a pair raising all the games it made last week to test again.
NEUT4|The key one point 3040 support area.
BEAR5|Other lower Banjar band is also restraining the price of the same location at the moment, so there is a potential for a rebound since the Stochastics are also indicating oversold conditions in the market.
BEAR6|However, there is something that we should keep in mind about that sideways move between one point, 3041 point 3389, and that is that this could be very direct angle and therefore a negative trend signal that the market may continue its downward direction from the one point 4667 peak, in which case a confirmation would come below one point, 3040 turning both the short and medium term outlook bearish probably also pushing support down to 1.20.
NEUT7|880 and then down to one point, 2760, which have been her both key barriers during 2018.
BEAR8|Otherwise, if the price rebounds within the box, immediate resistance may come from the 20 and 50 day moving average is currently within the high one point.
NEUT9|3117 one point 32 area moving beyond these lines.
NEUT10|The next step could be between the Upper Bollinger Band at one point 3317 and the one point 3389 sailing where they had 23.6% Fibo Nachi of the bearish wave from the one point 4667 peak.
BULL11|ICE also placed, so I break higher at this point, could be a greater achievement for the market because that would push the price out of their range.
NEUT12|Therefore is words of a downtrending market likely bringing the 200 day moving average at one point 3550, and then the 38.2% Fibonacci of one point 3632 next interview?
NEUT13|So that's all for dollar loonie today.
BULL14|"Thank you for watching and have a great weekend."""
