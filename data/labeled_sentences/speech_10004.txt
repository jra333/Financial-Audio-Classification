NEUT0|"""Hey guys just want to give you a quick overview of this package I found in R. It's called PD fetch and what it does is fetches economic and financial time series data from public sources."
NEUT1|So I'm going to give you a quick overview of how to use this to fetch stock data from Yahoo.
NEUT2|So let's get started.
NEUT3|So the first thing we want is to get the library.
NEUT4|Here.
NEUT5|Castle on.
NEUT6|TD.
NEUT7|Fetch and what this does is basically that's our library.
NEUT8|It's a very simple.
NEUT9|Script let's just.
NEUT10|Speedy fetch_Yahoo and then what we want is the ticker name.
NEUT11|So let's say IBM for now.
NEUT12|And that's it.
NEUT13|And if you run that.
NEUT14|You should.
NEUT15|Start getting your.
NEUT16|Your highs and lows.
NEUT17|As you can see, and the easiest way to do this is obviously you can put that into a data frame, so we also IBM data.
NEUT18|And we can view that data.
NEUT19|If you run that.
NEUT20|Capital V. Awesome so you you get all your data from 2007 all the way it goes all the way to 2016 'cause it's only showing 1000 rows but you get your open your high your low, your clothes, your volume and justice closing.
NEUT21|Now what you can start doing is now start plotting them and doing some analysis on them.
NEUT22|So I found that really quickly to get your publicly public data into R very quickly.
NEUT23|So I hope you like the video if you do.
