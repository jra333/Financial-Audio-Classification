NEUT0|"""What is to bring up a old memory?"
NEUT1|The key to this market for you today and to bring back another old memory.
NEUT2|It's Apple.
NEUT3|We've got some comments on Apple today that are just downright extraordinary because again, they are a little bit like the purloined letter.
NEUT4|That, right in your face.
BULL5|But Jim Suva City upcoming 5G current expectations reset lower potential for share, gain wearables for Apple Apple Services.
NEUT6|And by the way, Apple, Wedbush also comes up with a 5G and Apple can.
NEUT7|It can become the leader that it used to be.
NEUT8|I don't find any of those.
NEUT9|As being, I think there nothings in no brainer of business, but a lot of those were predictable.
NEUT10|And yet here we go.
BEAR11|The expectations were low.
BULL12|A lot of people got off the horse and at last dip 5G does await us and it looks like there could be a lot of share taken the services.
NEUT13|The service revenues.
NEUT14|Last night they came out with a half a trillion dollar business that was service revenue and Apple apps and that was last year.
NEUT15|Should be much bigger this year.
NEUT16|I think that the Apple.
NEUT17|I think Apple Pay is going to be gigantic 'cause we like contactless pay, so that's the leader David.
NEUT18|That's the key to this market.
NEUT19|Alright, and you know specific to that.
NEUT20|There is news as well as you know, Jim.
NEUT21|The European Commission has decided to open an investigation into Apple's App Store rules.
NEUT22|It really seems to be specific to Apple Music, right?
NEUT23|Spotify of course involved here, and they're going to be having a conference call with their legal officer, but there certainly being outspoken here in terms of of whether Apple has been any competitive in its behavior, any impact there?
NEUT24|No, I don't think so.
NEUT25|I think the president's people would regard it as shakedown.
BULL26|I think that Apple is very, very powerful and Lee Cooperman yesterday said some great things.
NEUT27|He said that one of the date, the problem with Fang is that they're also powerful that governments are going to gang up on them.
NEUT28|So there you are government intrusion.
BEAR29|I also thought to think that what Lee said that was really disheartening was he said there are 13 million new traders that have come in, and it's going to end with tears that they're not going to be able to be taught how to invest.
NEUT30|And you could argue that maybe there's no such thing as teaching.
NEUT31|But when you look at Apple and you look at how cheap it was, you really have to say what were we thinking?
NEUT32|How do we not know that it was?
NEUT33|"Razor razor blade model, which is what it really is become."""
