NEUT0|"""Joining us now for more in a first on CNBC interview is AMC Entertainment CEO Adam Aron."
NEUT1|Adam.
NEUT2|He must have been relieved that the obituaries were being written.
BEAR3|The bankruptcy lawyers and bankers have been circling.
NEUT4|How did you get this latest deal done and how long is it really going to last?
NEUT5|Well, you know what Mark Twain said.
NEUT6|The rumors of my death are greatly exaggerated.
NEUT7|I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that AMC is based in Kansas City and our Chiefs were victorious last night.
NEUT8|Heading to the Super Bowl.
BULL9|But the Chiefs weren't the only outfit in Kansas City that was a huge winner this weekend.
BULL10|AMC raised $917 million as you said, that's a tremendous amount of increase to our cash reserves.
BULL11|That means that we're going to make it through this dark coronavirus winner.
NEUT12|All talk of bankruptcy is off the table.
NEUT13|For now.
BULL14|We're very optimistic, encouraged, and enthusiastic as we look ahead.
NEUT15|So what is the capital structure of your business look like when this is all said and done?
NEUT16|The percentages, for instance of Silver Lake and Wanda.
NEUT17|What happened to them?
NEUT18|Well, what is store largest shareholder?
BEAR19|But their Holdings are now less than 20% of our total server base.
NEUT20|Silver Lake was a debt investor in AMC, not an equity investor.
NEUT21|Silver Lake is about $600 million of our in our debt, and our in our deposition want is still his board seats.
NEUT22|Silver Lake still is a board seat.
NEUT23|But you know, we're just at this point.
NEUT24|We're now a big public company.
NEUT25|With a diverse shareholder base and creditor base.
BULL26|But more important than that, for a company that is a lot of cash in the bank and that bodes very well for us to survive through this crisis.
NEUT27|And suddenly a lot of cash in the bank, you know relative to where it was.
BULL28|And as you said, that should be enough to get you through to the summer time.
NEUT29|Also, of course, a lot of debt on the balance sheet.
NEUT30|When is it realistic for you to hope to pay some of that down and see the equity value recover accordingly?
NEUT31|Well, thanks for the question.
BULL32|Well if you know, I think we've proven over the last nine months that we are a smart financial engineers here at AMC.
BULL33|We've raised money five times since April of 2020.
BULL34|We've got an enormous support from our landlord community to whom we're very grateful we got that support in 2020.
BULL35|We're counting on more landlord support in 2021.
NEUT36|I do believe will.
NEUT37|Put those skills to work.
BULL38|Even this year we were able, in July of last year, for example, to wipe out $555 million of debt through a fairly sophisticated debt exchange.
NEUT39|I would expect that similarly, in 2021, will look at the debt exchange options, possibly debt for equity options.
NEUT40|We we do need to right the capital structure of this business is clearly one of the action items on our list.
NEUT41|The first one, though of course was get the liquid ITI.
NEUT42|We need to survive this winter, which we can put a check in that box.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
