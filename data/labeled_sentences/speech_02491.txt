NEUT0|"""Now for a look at the latest changes in the trifecta stocks portfolio here at the street, we've got portfolio manager Christopher Saatchi."
BULL1|Nice to see you, Chris.
BULL2|Nice to see you.
BULL3|Rhonda is always alright.
NEUT4|You made some additions.
NEUT5|Tell me about Disney's stock you added.
NEUT6|Well, Disney was a great name that we had and you have to remember to for trifecta.
NEUT7|We've got a triple screen that we have to go through, right?
NEUT8|We have the street quant ratings we have to deal with Bob.
NEUT9|Lying is going to look at it from a technical perspective and I think they call me the fundamental detective.
NEUT10|So we kind of look at it this way.
NEUT11|And you know, these names have to bubble up.
NEUT12|As long as all three are giving it the big thumbs up.
NEUT13|So in.
BEAR14|From Disney's perspective look, you know the stock got hit in August pretty hard and I've been circling at first quite some time now because we have one of the biggest catalysts coming, Rhonda.
NEUT15|You know what that is?
NEUT16|Star Wars.
NEUT17|That's exactly right on December 18th.
BEAR18|That's going to drop, and we've already seen a lot of excitement, enthusiasm, percolate up on that name force.
NEUT19|Friday was fantastic, but you know, Disney is much more than that.
BULL20|We're seeing a big move as we head into 2016 with more Marvel movies, more Pixar movies, and.
NEUT21|More Star Wars movies.
NEUT22|So from that aspect where content is King, Disney is a place to be alright, that's easy to understand.
NEUT23|The next stock might be a little bit harder to understand.
NEUT24|American Water.
NEUT25|I think that's a very interesting comment.
NEUT26|Rhonda, because you know last time I checked, everybody uses water, right?
NEUT27|I know I got, showered, shaved to come over and talk to you this morning.
NEUT28|Fantastic, so you know it's a different twist on it.
BULL29|OK, because the water utility industry is extremely fragmented, which is great for consolidation opportunity here.
NEUT30|And the other driving forces that you know most people don't know this.
BEAR31|But when you look around the water infrastructure in the US, it actually is a horrible rating.
NEUT32|Something around AD minus, which means you need a company with the balance sheet they can go in and replace and update all the equipment there.
BULL33|So that really puts American Water works in a great position to be the consolidator of choice.
NEUT34|So you consider it a utility play.
NEUT35|Then I would consider it.
NEUT36|Yeah, utility play with a lot of growth aspects to it and and it's what makes it even more.
BULL37|Appealing to me is ever since the company's gone public year in year out, they've raised their dividends.
NEUT38|So you have that rising dividend that acts as a nice, you know step function higher for the stock price?
NEUT39|Yeah, that's where I was getting out.
NEUT40|'cause most people think of utilities is a dividend play, but you also see both with the growth story.
NEUT41|Absolutely alright, Chris Versace.
BULL42|Good to see you.
BULL43|Good to see you.
NEUT44|"I'm Rhonda Schaffler for the street."""
