NEUT0|"""How to spot a recession."
BEAR1|Most economists only see a recession in the rearview mirror after it's already started, although some economists watch the equity markets in every swoon in the equity market, they're worried about a recession and then it rarely happens.
NEUT2|And then, of course, there's the.
NEUT3|Inverted yield curve.
BEAR4|It is a superb measure of future recessions, but it has a real big problem timing when the yield curve inverts short term rates higher than long term bond yields, it can mean a recession is coming in six months.
NEUT5|12 months, maybe two years, and if rate policy's change in that time, the recession may not occur at all.
NEUT6|That's what's happened in the US, by the way, the feds change direction so the yield curve may not be even in signaling.
BEAR7|A recession is coming.
NEUT8|So what do we look at for shorter term indicators, one of the best ones is to look at high yield debt.
NEUT9|Now if you think about high yield debt, it's it's often viewed as an option.
NEUT10|So if you own a stock, it's like owning a call option on the assets of the company.
BULL11|The stock goes up.
NEUT12|The call option goes up if you own debt.
NEUT13|It's like owning a put option on the assets of a company.
NEUT14|So if the company goes South and is not making money anymore, the high yield debt.
BEAR15|Interest rate is going to go up so when high yield debt interest rates go up, your put option is losing money.
BEAR16|The debt's not doing well, and it's a signal.
NEUT17|A recession could be coming so we watch high yield debt spreads against government bond spreads, but they have to rise significantly.
BULL18|A small rise in high yield debt interest rates is no big deal, but a big rise watch out.
NEUT19|Now people also look at the jobs market.
BEAR20|All recessions have a lot of job losses.
BEAR21|The thing about it is that companies get in trouble.
BEAR22|They're not making money and then they cut jobs.
BEAR23|So jobs are a lagging indicator, but if you are looking at jobs and you're thinking about a US recession, you can watch the weekly new unemployment claims.
NEUT24|That's the most recent data.
NEUT25|And by the way, if a recession happens, that data turns South really fast.
NEUT26|You will know it in just three or four or five weeks.
NEUT27|Because it just gets worse and worse and worse, so that's what we watch first.
NEUT28|The high yield bonds.
NEUT29|Then we watch the jobs and hopefully we can see this before it's coming.
