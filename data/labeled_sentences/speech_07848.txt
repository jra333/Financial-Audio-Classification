NEUT0|"""Of course they are Jeff."
NEUT1|I mean that's what markets do they get ahead of themselves and they think about it and they reel it back in a little bit.
NEUT2|Let's think about the worker at the pizza shop around the corner that we all used to like.
BEAR3|And now that pizza shop is closed.
NEUT4|Alright, $2000 stimulus checks and everybody's pocket.
BEAR5|Were they to happen tomorrow still wouldn't get that pizza shop open again because the covid pandemic and the social safety measures.
NEUT6|That's public health measures to keep us all safe as we can be one.
NEUT7|Allow that to happen so.
BULL8|Pumping money into supporting comes is good and it's going to keep people eating and it's something that we have to do at least for a while.
NEUT9|But we're not going to get people back to work and have companies supporting their incomes with real economic activity for some time to come.
NEUT10|And by the way, if everybody got their shot and we were all clear to go out tomorrow to buy pizza, that pizza shop around the corner from you would still be broke and it would need some support from the government or from somebody to go back into business again.
NEUT11|Personally, I'd re capitalize it in a minute.
NEUT12|He had really good pizza.
NEUT13|But not every pizza shop or not.
NEUT14|Every retail store has the advantage of having a potential benefactor out there.
NEUT15|We need public policy to take broken companies and repair them.
NEUT16|'cause it's cheaper to repair the broken companies and let them support the workers and to do it all by public income assistance.
NEUT17|A car, what we've seen on the markets this week in response to the Democratic sweep, has been a move in US 10 year Treasury yield.
BULL18|Trying to settle into a new range above 1%.
NEUT19|What does this mean in terms of how the market is thinking about inflation?
NEUT20|Because I know in some of your research you point out is not the fiscal spending the stimulus from the government that is going to be potentially inflationary.
NEUT21|You've been looking at the oil price impact.
NEUT22|Right, Karen and the oil price impact is something we have on our radar here at high frequency economics.
BEAR23|Long before we get enough of a reduction in Slack to start putting pressure on prices, or we're going to see a bump up in oil prices in March, April and May, and that will then continue to some extent through the rest of the year.
BEAR24|It's going to push our inflation metrics through the roof, right up by as much as two percentage points in April, and this is simply not because oil prices are so high today, but because they were so low a year ago.
NEUT25|And the year over year change in oil prices is what affects the year over year change in CPI that you and I and everybody in the market refers to offhandedly as inflation.
NEUT26|Now it's not inflation alright?
NEUT27|'cause it's only the change of 1 price in the basket.
BULL28|But people are going to see headline CPI rising to two percentage points more than core CPI in April as oil prices moved to double their average price of a year ago.
BEAR29|And that's going to be confusing for a lot of people.
BEAR30|We could get an inflation scare in the spring.
NEUT31|It won't affect the central bankers.
NEUT32|"They can look through this noise and these distortions with the markets maybe a little bit more reactive to it."""
