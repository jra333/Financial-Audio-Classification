BEAR0|"""You have been warning for some time about secular stagnation."
NEUT1|People have been talking about the possible japanification they call it of the United States of Europe.
BEAR2|We have a crisis at the moment.
NEUT3|Does this drive us faster?
NEUT4|Tord that result?
NEUT5|Or is it just entirely a separate phenomenon?
NEUT6|No, we are essentially there.
BEAR7|We are essentially when you know interest rates reached 30 basis points earlier this week, on 10 year instruments, the index bond market was telling us that for 30 years the real interest rate was going to be negative.
NEUT8|The bond markets were telling us that markets did not expect inflation.
BULL9|On the Fed's preferred measure to get as high as 1%.
NEUT10|In the next generation, that means we're essentially at the Japanese place.
NEUT11|That's a place where that's very hard to get out of, as the Japanese experience suggests, is increasingly the European experience suggests, so we're going to need bolder and more experimental approaches.
NEUT12|And, critically, we're going to need much more aggressive fiscal policy and everything that happens in the health area.
BEAR13|Is just going to make it worse?
NEUT14|We're not condemned to decades of japanification.
NEUT15|But make no mistake when the 30 year interest rate in your country is 3/10 of 1%.
BEAR16|And the index bond that pays addition inflation in general is way below 0 closer to negative 1%, then to zero.
NEUT17|You have the phenomenon known as liquidity trap known as the known as secular stagnation, in which market signals are telling you that you don't have enough demand.
BEAR18|"And we're coming into a period where we're going to have absenteeism on a scale we've ever seen and already we're having those massive shortages of demand."""
