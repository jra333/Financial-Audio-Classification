NEUT0|"""Joining us for more is Oakmark portfolio manager Tony Kanaris Tony."
BULL1|Thanks for joining us.
NEUT2|I know you guys are value investors at oakmark.
BEAR3|There was a glimmer of hope for value stocks in the last few weeks, although that's faded and been swept up in all of the selling.
NEUT4|Does it tell you there's some deeper economic concerns here at play?
NEUT5|Well, it's always hard to tell what the market's telling you at any point in time, but at oakmark, you know we're focused on buying good businesses at good prices.
BULL6|Run by good people and we're finding great opportunities in a market like this, which is really buy for kated between the haves and have nots from a valuation perspective, there's just a lot of dispersion today and it's a ripe environment for us to be picking stocks.
NEUT7|Haven't had not from a covid perspective as well in terms of which industries are doing well and which aren't.
NEUT8|So where are those opportunities right now?
NEUT9|Give us a few names, some pics.
NEUT10|Well, sure I can.
NEUT11|I'll talk about a sector that's out of favor and I'll talk about a name that we find interesting.
NEUT12|Is is really overlooked fundamentally right now?
NEUT13|As for the single name, T-Mobile is a stock that we bought in the Oakmark Fund in the second quarter.
NEUT14|This is a classic good to great story.
BULL15|It was good company before the Sprint merger, but we think it's going to be great after.
BULL16|Before Sprint they took 85% of the subscriber growth in the industry, which is great.
BULL17|After Sprint, they're going to have more spectrum than Verizon and AT&T combined.
BULL18|They're going to have three times the 5G capable network capacity that Verizon has today.
NEUT19|And then there's the synergies and management's targeting.
NEUT20|$5.5 billion of synergies.
BULL21|We think that's conservative, and this is going to be a much more competitive company with a better network.
BULL22|And a better cost structure.
BULL23|And we think they're going to do great in that environment when you look at the valuation it sells in line with AT&T and Verizon, which we believe is undeserved, given the better growth track record and the synergies not even being an EBIT da numbers this year, so that's an opportunity on an absolute basis if you look out three to four years after the synergies are running through the income statement, you could see T-Mobile generating over $15 a share in free cash flow, and if they do that.
BEAR24|"We think the stock at 100 and change is just far too cheap."""
