BULL1|I'm kind of impressed with all of the banks.
BULL2|They really done great things.
BEAR3|Wells itself probably the weakest only because Wells has to take care of certain things.
BULL4|But this is a good number and you can argue that it's a growth number.
BEAR5|People who hate this group should recognize that it was already hated.
BEAR6|These stocks have come down so much if we look at JP Morgan were trading at 1:18 this quarter reported.
BEAR7|JPMorgan be down 10 points.
NEUT8|But if these prices it's just gotten a little, they just got too cheap and I like I like this Golden number we hear more.
BEAR9|Goldman Conference calls for the last two years have been pretty bad.
BEAR10|Pretty bad meeting their disjointed and somewhat negative.
BEAR11|If these guys can actually say listen, we did well and we're in good shape as opposed to hey, we didn't do well and we're not in good shape, which is kind of the theme of the last few.
BULL12|I think the stock can continue to rally.
NEUT13|You know, if you were looking for like a building block that to come after December 24th.
NEUT14|A banks making a stand and actually some data points that show that the operations aren't so bad.

BEAR18|More Bank of America is a growth stock after this and I can't believe that the stock got hit.
NEUT19|It's probably the Bank of America want to make very clear is the best.
BULL20|It's the best so far.
NEUT21|It is rather extraordinary how much the digitising solution that they have.
NEUT22|You know what they are there?
NEUT23|Amazon but they make money.
NEUT24|I mean, that's how good they become an I really think that this is 1/4 of the Brian one hand shine.
NEUT25|They are just making so much money.
NEUT26|Off the digital customer and digital customers happy, so that's this company is far for more forward than every other.
BULL27|They do have a great app.
NEUT28|It does matter they're converting people incredibly, the Eric's got 5,000,000 customers.
NEUT29|I had them on a year ago.
BULL30|They had none so I just feel like that they're doing so much right and that this company's got to get a premium multiple.
NEUT31|OK, it's just too cheap.
BULL32|"The group is right."""
