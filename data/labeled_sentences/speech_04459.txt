NEUT0|"""Today, if we have a lot of excitement about Cloverdale we do is really in the news we do."
NEUT1|That was a deal that Chamath Paula Papatya was on our air promoting.
NEUT2|Of course, when they did that deal, he's done a few since then, so 5 being a key one, but Hindenburg comes out, you know, this firm.
NEUT3|This is the firm that came out with a long report on Nicola Anne.
BEAR4|Dramatically cut the value of that company's stock.
NEUT5|Stillwell above.
BULL6|10 bucks is Nikola, but nowhere near the highs it once was.
NEUT7|When, when Hindenburg came out, and really the main thing we always remember, of course, is the truck going down the Hill without actually having any.
NEUT8|Problem being propelled by anything, but on this one Jim listen, I don't you know they question Clover's business model.
NEUT9|They say that according to them again we haven't confirmed any of these things that there is the DOJ is taking a look at some of their business practices, but we talk a lot about specs, gym in general, the good and the bad and the ugly.
NEUT10|They continue every day.
NEUT11|We will continue to have people on of course.
BULL12|So many new companies coming to the market.
NEUT13|I mean for a long time we were starved for new companies because so many state private so long because they could get the funding they needed.
NEUT14|In the private markets that has changed dramatically with the Advent icepacks, but you've made the point many times.
NEUT15|The spec files then when they do the deal, for example 23 andme.
NEUT16|Today, they say it's worth 3 1/2 billion, but the projections they don't have to stand by quite the same way when they put them in an S1, do they?
NEUT17|No, I I think Tom Farley had some great comments this morning on Squawk Box about frankly the ability to be able to project kind of whatever you want.
NEUT18|That's a little bit of looser interpretation what Tom said, but you know what, David?
NEUT19|When I read the the Hindenburg headline I don't know.
NEUT20|Maybe you can tell me whether this is suboptimal, not Clover health, how the King of Spacks lured retail investors into a broken business facing an active, undisclosed Department of Justice investigation.
NEUT21|David, you know when I see a lot of buy, sell, hold.
NEUT22|And I hear you said good, bad, ugly.
NEUT23|This kind of reminds me of Lee Van Cleef in the movie.
NEUT24|Good, bad and ugly.
NEUT25|Or Eli wallach.
NEUT26|This is not a story about Clint Eastwood.
NEUT27|OK, it's not Clinton.
BULL28|By the way we've been clip was so underrated.
NEUT29|It's a.
NEUT30|It's a travesty.
NEUT31|There's not even.
NEUT32|There's not enough Monument Vegas for that guy.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
