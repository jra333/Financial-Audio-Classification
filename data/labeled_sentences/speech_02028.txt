NEUT0|"""He is going to update video on CL VS as I know a lot of people have been wondering if this was going to break out today or if this one is going to sell off as this one has been on a huge sell off recently only for which I'm going to show you exactly what that looks like and I'm gonna give an exact justification on why or why not."
NEUT1|I would be buying and when I'll be buying so again, I do appreciate everybody that has been in the comment section.
BULL2|You guys may show me love and I appreciate everybody so we're gonna get into this now let's go right into CL VS this one has been on a nice run up.
BULL3|I love the volume that has been coming in and this is also an amazing day trade that we did.
BULL4|Playing too, but however we do see that it is hitting resistance here.
NEUT5|We do have a huge Kennewick on the four hour.
NEUT6|It does not look like it's trying to have a solid candle on the flower on the 1813 resistance here.
NEUT7|Now again, this is where we previously were consolidating.
NEUT8|Now again, if we look at the five minute we actually are consolidating exactly around that exact support level.
BULL9|So again, we're trying to find support here.
BEAR10|It looks like the volume is starting to decrease.
NEUT11|Recently.
NEUT12|We do want to see more by pressure, but however we see this amount of I'm going to see exactly we're looking at here on the five minutes so.
NEUT13|We do see this large amount of pressure we came down had cell volume and then we had a small amount of by pressure.
NEUT14|You would imagine if we were going to have a larger spike up we would probably have being a lot more by pressure here, at least to be taken us that far.
BEAR15|But however we do see more sell pressure showing us that this is possibly going to be having a sell off soon as we do have a decrease in by pressure, an increase in cell pressure.
NEUT16|So again this is something that you guys definitely want to be watching when you guys are trading.
NEUT17|If you guys are not watching these, I'm telling you I'm seeing traders every day.
NEUT18|They're not looking at these things.
NEUT19|And it's very simple to look at, so be honest.
NEUT20|The Mac D is right here.
NEUT21|This is cell pressure.
NEUT22|We have the by volume right here.
BULL23|We do want to see confirmation on the volume as well, so again, we do want to break out of this level right here.
NEUT24|This is a very key level.
NEUT25|These are very huge green candles.
NEUT26|We want to make sure we do get huge green candles breaking into these.
NEUT27|Again, these are very strong resistance levels and the reason why I say that.
NEUT28|Again, we're going for a second show.
NEUT29|You exactly why?
BULL30|These are very strong key levels as again, this is when we previously did break out.
NEUT31|We would have to break out of 950 and then we have to break out of new highs and the reason why I don't like this one.
NEUT32|Specifically is because we do see that this does have bearish divergance.
NEUT33|That is, when the price action is going from lower to higher and then we see the RSI, I'm going to pull it up right here so you can see exactly we're looking at the RSI at that exact price action.
BEAR34|On the RSI we do see that the price they are size going from higher to lower their for showing us that the price action is going to soon possibly be reversing and going South.
NEUT35|Logan, I'm going to show you exactly what happened here.
BEAR36|We had that huge sell off here again, that was a huge sell off on decrease in volume man.
BULL37|Again, a huge amount of cell volume, but again we did see this huge green spike here.
NEUT38|This is something still to be on the watch.
BEAR39|It's not something that we're not going to take consideration, but however at these levels, based on bearish divergent and based on these very strong resistances at these levels, I would probably wait for it to break out of new highs only because of all this red sell off that we saw at any point in time, this stock and completely fell off.
NEUT40|So again we want to make sure careful on type of plays like this.
NEUT41|We want to make sure we are breaking in new highs a lot of times, and if not we want to make sure we're not trying to break out a very key levels that there was previously in the stock, so again.
NEUT42|I hope you guys mentioned breakouts.
NEUT43|We will be continuing today is always an.
NEUT44|If you guys have been in the comment section.
NEUT45|Must love to you guys and if you guys do have a watch list or in the comment section ask questions.

BULL47|God bless you guys.
BULL48|"I'm going to keep making sure you guys try to learn this and again God bless you guys and I will see you guys next video."""
