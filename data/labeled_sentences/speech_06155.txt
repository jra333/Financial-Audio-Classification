NEUT0|"""It's clear in this video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, I'm in the state, the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but very impressive bounds to them and you think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here, and since then it's, you know, fought back up to where it has.
NEUT4|Don't get me wrong, yes, there's still work that needs to be done, but point here being that is a nice move, but it does bring about the valid question of, but is there any sort of true power behind this price point?
NEUT5|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT6|Dead Cat Bounce, site move and I have no idea.
NEUT7|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward, and in my mind or falls on a single area.
NEUT8|On that area is down here at 3150 Wise 3150 import and I'm not saying at all this was going to actually happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT9|If the price were to come down to that area, behave in that manner and then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT10|Well, that would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range of the chart that it just broke out from.
NEUT11|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sign of true strength.
NEUT12|But to be fair, I mean no pricing goes straight up, so maybe the price comes down here.
NEUT13|Behave in that manner then starts to work way back upwards.
NEUT14|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there.
NEUT15|You'd have that Lowe's down there if you envision each of those as stair steps.
NEUT16|Well, hey there we go now.
NEUT17|You have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT18|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT19|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL20|It's going to make progress forward and again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as the 3150 mark in the event the price continues to work its way back upwards.
NEUT21|Next key big battle.
NEUT22|Going to watch moving forward is going to be the Purple line there, which on my chart is denoting the 50.
NEUT23|Moving average and current value of that.
NEUT24|Let's just call the 3200 Mark.
NEUT25|So keep a close eye and 3200 moving forward.
NEUT26|But anyway, look at it.
NEUT27|Nice bounce today, not just a question of can the price build upon this bounce moving forward.
NEUT28|Let's see what happens.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL34|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up.
