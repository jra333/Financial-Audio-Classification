BULL0|"""Well, if not, we had some news out of China that sort of picked the markets, moved up a little bit, but there's a lot of nervousness around the state of negotiations in Washington this week and going into next month."
NEUT1|Tomi Kilgore is here to tell us and how markets are dealing with all of these swirling factors.
NEUT2|What are things looking like at this stage?
NEUT3|Well, it's a.
BEAR4|It's a little bit down, not too much, but considering we lost about 185 points in the Dow on Friday, you'd like to see a little bit of a bounce after a day like that.
NEUT5|And it's not so much that the markets expecting.
BEAR6|Bad news or anything, it's just that they're not sure what to do, and that's even that's sometimes can be worse.
NEUT7|Uncertainty, right?
NEUT8|I mean, one would have thought that last week when the Fed decided not to go forward with tapering, its bond, buying that this would have been good news.
BEAR9|And of course, we've got a bit of a bump on Wednesday, but since then we really haven't moved.
BEAR10|It's really been quite a negative response, right?
NEUT11|Yeah, why is that exactly?
BEAR12|Well, they started and look past the actual event and now they're starting to look at the fact that they lowered their GDP.
BEAR13|Forecasts are starting to worry now.
NEUT14|They have the budget to think about.
NEUT15|The slow, slower economy.
BEAR16|The reason they couldn't taper is that going to affect third quarter earnings there.
NEUT17|They're kind of looking down the road and and the idea is that they're not sure now and now we have a whole another month and a half for the next Fed meeting that we have to worry about this.
NEUT18|And that's another thing that the markets don't like to do right, right?
NEUT19|What else is on tap for today then?
NEUT20|Well, there's some Fed speakers today.
NEUT21|There isn't a lot of data out this week, so there's some Fed speakers and you know, people are hoping a little bit of clarity, but I mean, I don't really know their lives in New York, Fed President said he does have some clout.
NEUT22|Yeah, trying to clarify what their intent was, right?
NEUT23|'cause they didn't leave they do right?
NEUT24|Basically, what can they do?
NEUT25|You know?
NEUT26|So I think that they're not going to get clarity, and that's the other idea.
NEUT27|That is one of the concerns.
NEUT28|Yeah, you got some stocks.
NEUT29|You look at.
BEAR30|That particular BlackBerry came out pretty late on a Friday, and they said they're cutting a bunch of jobs and their projection for revenue is was half of what was expected.
BEAR31|I mean, the bigger losses.
NEUT32|I mean it just just does not look good in the stock.
BEAR33|Took a big hit very late in the day on Friday and it's falling again today.
NEUT34|It's another down into their sad story.
NEUT35|Yeah, what else you got, So what?
BULL36|A little bit of good news is GE signed pretty decent sized deal 1.9 billion with to build plants in Algeria and the CEO had mentioned this earlier in the year that this could be an important deal for the company and that generated business is kind of weak so it's a good news for them.
NEUT37|And Citigroup is on your right arm.
BEAR38|Yeah, there was a report in the Financial Times saying that they might have some weak, some weak trading revenue an mostly because the markets were so slow over the summer so that.
NEUT39|It could translate to other companies as well.
BULL40|Other banks alright Tommy.
BULL41|Well thank you so much.
BULL42|"Thank you."""
