NEUT0|"""Did I mention we do have a couple of interesting calls today?"
BULL1|Steph Amazon gets upgraded to outperform over at Bernstein.
NEUT2|They missed it, right?
NEUT3|They missed it.
BULL4|They're finally upgrading it.
NEUT5|They should have done it back in March.
BULL6|They say year to date it's up 65%.
NEUT7|You been trimming it though and you've been trimming it since about a month ago and I'm wondering, sort of.
NEUT8|Is this like a continuous?
BULL9|Thing that you're doing well, I mean, I just yeah, I mean well, I thought their quarter was flawless.
NEUT10|I mean, there was nothing wrong whatsoever.
BULL11|49% retail sales growth, awos backlog, up, 65% operating income, up 138%.
BULL12|I don't know much how much better it gets from here though, and I just think a lot of good news is priced in.
BULL13|It's up 65%.
BEAR14|It just had a quick 16% decline in the shares.
NEUT15|So if it actually pulls back further this would be on my buy list.
NEUT16|But I just thought it was prudent to take profit.
NEUT17|OK, Brenda Facebook.
NEUT18|300 bucks at Oppenheimer today.
BEAR19|That's from 270.
NEUT20|It's a price target.
NEUT21|Raise you own Facebook.
NEUT22|We do and you have Facebook.
NEUT23|If you look at within the Fang stocks, it's one of the more attractively valued companies.
NEUT24|It's the one that everybody loves to hate, but in our view, with over 3 billion eyeballs on their platform, it's just something that can't be ignored by by advertisers.
BULL25|"So we think the company is going to continue to do well."""
