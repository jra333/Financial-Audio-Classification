NEUT0|"""That was Nick Watt reporting."
BEAR1|Now the coronavirus is having a clear impact on our global economy, financial markets, plunging for the sixth consecutive day, the Dow closed down over 1100 points.
BEAR2|The NASDAQ and S&P 500, both dropping over 4%.
BEAR3|Today, was the worst single day decline for the S&P 500 in nearly nine years.
BEAR4|This comes as California announced it is monitoring thousands of people for the coronavirus and fears of community spread across the United States continues to grow.
NEUT5|Joining us now in studio to explain what all of this means for our economy and how it may impact your wallet.
NEUT6|We have Doctor Anthony Chan.
NEUT7|Doctor Chan is the former chief economist at JP Morgan Chase, visiting us from New York City.
NEUT8|First of all, welcome thank you for having me now as I just mentioned, talk to us about why the coronavirus is having such a large impact when it comes to Wall Street.
BEAR9|I think Wall Street right now is certainly very fearsome because they don't know how serious this is going to get.
BEAR10|As you probably have seen, global equity markets have lost more than.
NEUT11|$3 trillion worth of market cap.
BEAR12|Part of it is that it's going to have a negative impact on earnings because of the global supply chains.
BEAR13|We know that the earnings numbers were a little bit slow, soft, but nonetheless positive.
BEAR14|And now some expectations are that in the US, for example, we may see no earnings growth whatsoever, maybe even a little negative growth on the S&P 500, so the prices have to be adjusted.
NEUT15|So there's a lot of fear obviously surrounding the coronavirus now, with the stocks tumbling, do people need to be worried?
NEUT16|When it comes to the economy, I really don't think so.
NEUT17|I've actually studied all these health scares that we've had the last 10 or 12, and what I found was that 3/6 and 12 months later.
NEUT18|Guess what the equity market is higher.
BEAR19|So yes, there's a lot of uncertainty here.
NEUT20|Whether it was SARS, whether it was MERS, whether it was the Ebola virus virus, or whether it was Zika, all those things are very fearful and have a lot of uncertainty.
NEUT21|But all of them have one thing in common.
BULL22|They passed and the equity market recovered.
NEUT23|What does this mean for our viewers?
NEUT24|Watching how could this financially impact them in the short term?
NEUT25|I think that when you're an investor in Wall Street or in stocks, the most important thing to understand is you're not investing for the next 24 hours.
NEUT26|The next 48 hours you're really investing for the next 3-5 or 10 years, and if you are doing that, this is not something that should worry you.
NEUT27|If anything.
NEUT28|If you had extra money that you were dying to put in what you see these big plunges, these are opportunities to phase small amounts of money back into the equity market.
NEUT29|One more time, could you put this into perspective?
NEUT30|How does a virus like this make the market so unstable?
NEUT31|Again, the markets are always worried about uncertainty and if you hear all the medical experts, what are they saying?
NEUT32|They're saying that we don't know how serious this is going to be.
NEUT33|We don't know how long it's going to last.
BEAR34|All this uncertainty makes profitability and certainly the potential for consumer confidence to plunge and hurt the economy all that much more realistic.
NEUT35|And that's why the equity market is is very fearful but.
NEUT36|Every single time we've had these coronaviruses in the past 369 and 12 months later, the market goes up and why?
NEUT37|Because in less than a year, these things seem to disappear.
NEUT38|Alright, so no need to worry.
NEUT39|I don't think so, alright?
BULL40|Doctor, thank you so much for joining us.
BULL41|Really appreciate all of that.
NEUT42|"We will put this information on our website, catch12.com."""
