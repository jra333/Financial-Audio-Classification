NEUT0|"""Warren, again for people who are just waking up their tuning in and they want to know what you think about this."
BEAR1|Sell off this morning to see the Dow down 708 hundred points in the morning.
NEUT2|Yeah, what's your reaction when you see something like that?
NEUT3|Well, my reaction is that I like to buy stocks so I I don't wish ill on anybody else but I like that if they want to sell him to be cheaper.
NEUT4|I I prefer it.
NEUT5|So if that's a.
BEAR6|You know roughly a 3% decline or thereabouts.
BEAR7|I don't know how many 3% declines I've had in my lifetime, but there have been a lot of them.
NEUT8|And.
NEUT9|I. I can't think of one that you shouldn't have bought.
NEUT10|You know basically, that is mean stocks are going to go up or down next week or next month or next year, but but if there's something if you like to American businesses, you're getting a chance to buy a 3% cheaper.
NEUT11|I don't consider that a lot cheaper, I mean, but but, but how can it be bad news?
NEUT12|Unless you have to sell stocks now if you have to sell them for some reason, this year.
NEUT13|Worse off, if you don't have to sell him, I mean, somebody can come around and offer you a quote on your house today, and it could be 2% less than they offered you yesterday.
NEUT14|But if you like the house at Magnuson, make any difference to you.
NEUT15|Does that mean Berkshire will be buying stocks today?
NEUT16|Well, we certainly won't be selling.
BULL17|And yeah, we may.
NEUT18|"We could easily be buying something, sure."""
