NEUT4|This week I've picked Dr. Horton Inc. As we can see here, Horton has an average growth rate of more than 43% and a dividend yield of 1.1%.
BULL5|The risk analysis shows us that Horton has grown solidly over the past five years.
BULL6|Revenue has increased by almost 70%.

NEUT8|I am buying Horton in three batches.
NEUT9|The first one now and when Horton falls 10% or more I will buy again.
BULL10|Up to the fair value towards the blue line, we can expect a price increase of more than 45%.
