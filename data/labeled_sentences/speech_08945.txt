NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another very eventful day here.
NEUT5|An now that the dust has settled.
NEUT6|An interesting pattern has formed which is really mapped out a couple of key levels to keep an eye on which it gives us the ability to apply the KISS method here.
NEUT7|Keep it simple stupid, which means just focus on a couple areas and then just see how the price behaves with relative to these areas.
NEUT8|And the important thing about these areas is that it takes.
NEUT9|You know I'm not trying to come across like I have some sort of special talent or that I have some sort of special skill to have seen these areas know people that use charts, understand charts, have taken notice of these areas and they're going to be watching them too.
NEUT10|And when a lot of people are watching the same areas and wondering the same thing.
NEUT11|Call a self filling prophecy.
NEUT12|Carter if you want it can definitely produce very dynamic movements, and that's what we have here.
NEUT13|So the first level that a whole lot of people really watching is going to have drawn that red line in a place right there.
NEUT14|And they're going to be watching.
NEUT15|And rightfully so.
NEUT16|While nothing is guaranteed.
BULL17|My point here is, it's a more than valid thought to have that you know, if the pricing works way up there and get a break of the trend line that break in and of itself could very well create some good upside.
NEUT18|Buying pressure once again, not guaranteed to happen.
NEUT19|Those don't exist, but it's, you know it's not a random thought to have.
NEUT20|That actually makes good logical sense, and whether or not it happens remains to be seen, but you know.
NEUT21|By no means would that be throwing a dart in terms of an area that would make sense to buy, so that's gonna be the first area that a lot of people are watching and you're going to all sorts of Long's watching that area.
NEUT22|The other area that are going to be, you know, people are going to interested in mainly the shorts is down here at this one.
NEUT23|1725 mark over the course of the past couple of days you can see.
NEUT24|ACTED as support acted as support this morning.
NEUT25|ACTED as support so once more same logic, nothing's guaranteed, but it's more than valid thoughts out that you know if the price were to come down here, behave in that manner and then break to the downside.
NEUT26|That break could very well create quite a bit of downside selling pressure, so you're going to want to keep an eye on those couple areas going forward, but All in all, like I said, a very straightforward Kiss method here.
NEUT27|Keep it simple stupid.
NEUT28|Watch these couple levels unless the other price behaves relative to each of them.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT30|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT31|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL32|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT33|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT34|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT35|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT42|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay.
NEUT43|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT44|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT45|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
