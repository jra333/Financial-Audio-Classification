NEUT0|"""Second quarter earnings per share."
BEAR1|A dollar 74 two cents ahead of estimates.
BEAR2|It looks like revenue is actually a bit short of estimates at 13.23 billion dollars $13.3 billion.
NEUT3|So you could call that in line daily.
BEAR4|Active users also a little bit shy 1.47 billion.
NEUT5|The estimate was 1.48 billion and monthly active users 2.23 billion.
NEUT6|The estimate there two and a quarter billion.
BEAR7|So actually a little bit of a miss on the other side.
BULL8|Yeah, this doctor 7%.
NEUT9|So there's a rare reaction.
NEUT10|As you say, a little bit of a miss.
NEUT11|But you know there's so much expectations.
BULL12|Numbers are amazing overall for company side, but look at that real close to record today.
NEUT13|You have to look at Instagram too, which is the sleeping giant inside of Facebook.
NEUT14|They bought it for a billion dollars and it's going to make twice that this quarter.
BEAR15|Down 19 points.
NEUT16|I mean, that's a lot.
BULL17|It's a lot, but also, as Julie pointed, outside of record high, it's gained some 22% it so far this year it's recovered completely from the March sell off back in May.
BEAR18|It already made up that lost ground when you talk about Instagram.
NEUT19|I just did a quick search for Instagram in this earnings release.
NEUT20|No mention of it what?
NEUT21|So don't break it out.
NEUT22|They don't make it out.
NEUT23|When would they break it out?
NEUT24|Are they going to be required to break it out at some point?
NEUT25|I think at one point and it's not that far off in the future.
NEUT26|There's a possibility that that Instagram get spun out as a separate company, but really, it has the.
BULL27|Chance of becoming a much bigger entity actually than Facebook itself.
BEAR28|Facebook briefly touching 10% decline.
BEAR29|Also seeing shares of Twitter and Snap decline in sympathy.
NEUT30|You know look, the numbers are stellar, but at the key is at any level up here.
NEUT31|Slight misses matter.
BEAR32|So daily active users 1.47 billion a hair behind estimates.
NEUT33|But you see how much this stock had been priced for perfection.
NEUT34|IAM curious so when you look at these user numbers a little bit below estimates David.
BEAR35|Is it because of the bad publicity?
NEUT36|Is that actually taking a toll?
NEUT37|I doubt it to be honest.
NEUT38|I think you know security analysts aren't really experts at figuring out user numbers.
NEUT39|There are financial people.
BEAR40|I would say their day, but the problem is that this was a Nosebleed level stock that had gone up way too much.
BEAR41|I mean, I have been feeling that the issues surrounding Facebook's political cultural privacy issues inevitably are going to cost money to resolve.
NEUT42|And at some point it will affect the stock.
NEUT43|Now I don't know exactly what would leads people to bid it up to.
NEUT44|Whatever it was.
NEUT45|202 hundred and 1511 teen 217 and now it's at.
NEUT46|What is it one 8098 but it's.
NEUT47|It's not any fundamental problem with people wanting to use Facebook, if that's what you're asking.
NEUT48|Not no David, you you would know this better than I, but the teens and preteens are gravitate Ng very rapidly to Instagram and away from face and snap, yeah?
BEAR49|And that's a big problem, because they are the next generation of the two and a half billion daily users.
BEAR50|It would be a big problem if they didn't own Instagram.
NEUT51|That's right.
NEUT52|"The funny thing is, a lot of people don't even realize that Instagram is owned by Facebook."""
