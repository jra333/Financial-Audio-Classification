NEUT0|"""I've been looking at markets and writing in markets for about 20 years."
NEUT1|There are times when things don't make sense and this is one of them.
NEUT2|Today, the Dow cross 22,000.
BULL3|That's yet another milestone in its long run up.
NEUT4|You seem like we're walking on egg shells, right?
NEUT5|Something was going to happen.
NEUT6|It was going to take us down.
NEUT7|That's not happening right now.
NEUT8|We're at this sort of Wile E. Coyote moment.
NEUT9|Nobody runs over the Cliff, but he levitates for three or four seconds because he doesn't realize he's run over the Cliff.
NEUT10|And that's kind of what's happened in a lot of the market.
BEAR11|For a long time, we were worried that the US economy was very fragile.
BEAR12|The slightest sneeze could send it back into recession.
NEUT13|It wasn't true right.
NEUT14|But we didn't know that then this turmoil in Washington.
BULL15|Corporate profits are good but not great.
BEAR16|The economy is slow.
NEUT17|And yet the fear factor in the market is gone.
BEAR18|There's just this new stability in the global economy and one of the things that we've seen is that global economic volatility has fallen sharply so the other thing that's happening.
NEUT19|Is you seeing these hot stocks take off the shares of Alphabet?
NEUT20|That's the parent of Google.
NEUT21|Apple, Amazon and Facebook, and some of our big established names that we know like Apple and Amazon and some of our more names like Tesla, speculative names, biotech companies, tech companies that have great interesting products but very little profit right now.
NEUT22|And everyone says, oh, three years from now, they're going to be fantastic.
NEUT23|People are willing to take those risks.
NEUT24|Companies that may not even be profitable, or maybe making very low profits where the payoff is deferred many, many years and people are betting on some kind of.
NEUT25|Distant bonanza, they're saying, you know.
NEUT26|Heck, I'm going to put it all on Black 21 and see what happens and it's still a good bet.
NEUT27|And there were questions around.
NEUT28|You know all these companies?
BEAR29|I mean, Apple, for example, is become hugely dependent on the iPhone.
NEUT30|That's something that might make you nervous about Apple, and nobody is nervous about Apple.
NEUT31|The market is just ignoring things that they probably should pay attention to.
NEUT32|When President Trump was first elected, we saw the stock market rally, and then we saw.
BEAR33|Bonds Treasurys fell yields went up.
BULL34|The dollar rallied as well and a lot of that was predicated on this idea that there was going to be a big stimulus and tax cut package coming through there is.
NEUT35|Some hope of a tax cut still embedded in the market that matters a lot.
NEUT36|The big picture has not come through yet.
NEUT37|The market is here at an all time high and kind of seems to be pricing in stuff like the $2 trillion in savings over a decade for corporate America.
BEAR38|Through these tax cuts, and that's looking less and less likely, it's looking quite unlikely actually.
NEUT39|If you take away that tax cut.
NEUT40|If you take away the hopes of that tax cut, then.
BEAR41|"The market probably would fall."""
