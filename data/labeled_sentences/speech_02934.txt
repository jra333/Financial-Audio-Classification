BEAR0|"""Well, Facebook shares have dropped to a record low."
NEUT1|We've got Ben Pimentel of MarketWatch joining us now from San Francisco.
BULL2|Thank you very much, Ben.
NEUT3|This is how the mighty have fallen.
NEUT4|I think is how I would describe this.
BEAR5|We just looked at the three month chart of Facebook there and it's pretty bad.
NEUT6|Right under 20 bucks?
NEUT7|Yes, that's true.
BEAR8|Meanwhile, Julian Assange is holed up in Ecuadorian embassy.
BEAR9|Facebook stocks have been unleashed.
NEUT10|They've been unlocked.
BEAR11|And so now you have the stock falling to a record low and there could be more.
NEUT12|This is just the first wave of lockup.
NEUT13|Expiration will be another one in November where roughly about 1.3 billion shares will be made available.
NEUT14|1.3 billion.
NEUT15|I mean, that's an awful lot of shares now, but where are these shares coming from these these initial investors employees?
NEUT16|What it is exactly those initial investors, including employees.
NEUT17|And so the first wave is today, which is about 271,000,000.
BEAR18|The 1.3 billion actually is for the rest of the year, and there's another one in May next year, so that would presumably keep downward pressure on the stock unless new buyers are coming now.
BEAR19|Am I right in saying that this this initial public offering by Facebook has been plagued by disappointment from the very get go?
BEAR20|That's true, I mean the Facebook IPO before it launched in May was being touted as one of the biggest in tech history, but it became very controversial there, been lawsuits filed and now the stock is also has been struggling.
BEAR21|It's lost about more than about 50% of its value since its IPO price of 38 and part of the reason is also some questions on its prospects for growth as it competes with other Internet.
NEUT22|Players like led by Google One of the questions I know that's been raised banner is how Facebook is going to do in on mobile platforms and how it's going to actually bring money in through that.
NEUT23|There are still questions out there on that that's true, and I think that's actually a question for for most Internet players, including Google and Apple, but I guess the pressure is greater on Facebook since they now essentially, their strength isn't displaying ads where they're going up against Google.
NEUT24|So the question is really going forward and where they can find more growth.
BULL25|Now I know that one of the things that they've got to do is to continue to grow their earnings and their revenue as fast as as they can to basically get the stock price back up.
NEUT26|That's important in Silicon Valley for employee retention, isn't it?
NEUT27|That's true, specially now where there are a lot of startups, specially in social media and also in cloud computing.
NEUT28|So they will be competing for a lot of talent in the Valley and in tech in general.
NEUT29|So what happens?
NEUT30|I presume some employees are given stock options right where where they struck and if they were struck at the IPO price.
NEUT31|Now that's that's 20 bucks away from now.
NEUT32|I mean, that's not really a motivator right now.
NEUT33|Is it?
NEUT34|For those people exactly?
NEUT35|There's really a debate.
BEAR36|I mean, I've talked to one analyst, Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter, who actually has is thinking that this is not really insider insider selling their shares, but more the general market being swept away in what they called the media hype because of the more downbeat sentiment on the stock.
NEUT37|So, but clearly, for a lot of employees, this is for a lot of Facebook employees.
BEAR38|This is definitely disappointing.
BEAR39|Yeah, I bet it's very disappointing for them and we will have to leave it there.
NEUT40|I continuing story.
NEUT41|"I'm sure Ben Pimentel of MarketWatch and more on that story on marketwatch.com, and on wsj.com as well."""
