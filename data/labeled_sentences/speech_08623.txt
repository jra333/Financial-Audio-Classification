NEUT0|"""OK, it started rolling, no restart it."
NEUT1|We're going to do it again we restarted, restarted, restart, no.
NEUT2|I'll just edit that out.
NEUT3|The intro is.
NEUT4|Hello World I'm Emma hope good and I'm Anthony Monaco and this is vlog number 2 #2 today we're talking about Netflix stock.
NEUT5|I had recently bought into it.
NEUT6|Two weeks ago, when it took a little dip to 390, I bought into it about a week ago I bought at 368.
NEUT7|But then there was a crash, but then they came out with their earnings call.
BEAR8|Yesterday after hours and it dropped about $50, it went down to like three 48340 and it was at like 4.
BEAR9|It was went from 401 down to 348.
NEUT10|So like this over $50.
NEUT11|But we knew Netflix wasn't going anywhere, so you bought in the border we bought in again today, double down opening Bell.
NEUT12|So I bought another share at 347.
NEUT13|I got 345.
NEUT14|But at the end of the day, it closed at what 380?
BULL15|I think it said it shot back up throughout the day.
NEUT16|So yeah, Netflix isn't going anywhere so.
NEUT17|We plan on holding that stock for the next 10 years because I even saw article that in 2028 they're going to go from, I think, 150,000,000 subscribers to 300 now.
NEUT18|He's dead cables dead?
NEUT19|Yeah, that's part of the problem, not problem.
BULL20|But that's part of the reason why Netflix, at least TV apps are going up so much.
NEUT21|So yes, nobody watch watch is cable because nobody wants commercials.
NEUT22|So if you're not in the stock market yet, I recommend you again in the stock market.
NEUT23|"Because there's big money in there."""
