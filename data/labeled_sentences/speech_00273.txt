NEUT0|"""Do we need a rethink of monetary policy that's more targeted than it actually can help stimulate those who really need it?"
NEUT1|Well, that's what monetary policy three is the monetary policy one is interest rate based monetary policy.
NEUT2|Two is the classic quantitative easing Federal Reserve buys or central banks buy financial assets.
NEUT3|Monetary policy 3, which is now what we are seeing and what is needed.
NEUT4|Is the production of that debt.
NEUT5|Through government borrowing and the government direction of those checks to those who need it most, that's what we just saw.
NEUT6|And that being that monetized by the central banks, and so we're in a new era, OK of monetary policy.
NEUT7|Three, as I call it monetary policy.
NEUT8|Three will mean that the free market will play a much less role at in determining those capital market flows that the government as we come into the future will be thinking.
NEUT9|How do I get that money to those who need it the most, so it'll be a highly political decision.
NEUT10|Much more political than it was in the past, and that the central bank then will monetize those political decisions.
NEUT11|So monetary policy 3 means there's that type of coop cooperation.
NEUT12|So so those are the two dimensions of the big big change environment you're going to see much more government influences and direction of where money goes.
NEUT13|Which will have a big impact on not only the economy but of markets.
NEUT14|You have to watch what they're going to spend their money on, an there after watch where they're going to get their money from, what taxes and so on means the government will play a big, bigger role.
NEUT15|And it also means that there will be much more debt that is monetized.
NEUT16|"And that has implications for the value of financial assets and as into implications for the value of the currencies and so on."""
