BULL0|"""Yeah, it's even mentioned earlier stocks up over 50% since the IPO came at a very reasonable valuation."
NEUT1|We are fundamentally very bullish about Chuy's prospects, but I think there are a couple of things we're concerned about.
NEUT2|One is the move in the stock too.
NEUT3|When you do a price compare against Amazon, the prices are literally right on top.
NEUT4|Third, having worked in technology for 20 years and taken over 50 companies public, there is really little competitive differentiation around the technology.
NEUT5|They largely resell.
NEUT6|Other peoples products and effectively the competitive mode is the low so target Walmart the rest of the industry wants to be in this business as well.
BULL7|She definitely has incredible customer service and ineffectively this auto ship capability.
NEUT8|You know your dogs gonna eat your cat's gonna eat and so that's auto ship gives you great visibility but again in terms of price differential, the proprietary analysis we do on pricing suggests that other retailers are right on top of their pricing.
NEUT9|Sure, sure, but if the.
NEUT10|As long as the the other retailers aren't undercutting the prices by anything of magnitude, you just described a pretty reliable subscription based business now.
NEUT11|That that's right, and that's why you know.
NEUT12|Again, we're not celebrated or not buy rated.
NEUT13|We're right in the middle because there's elements of the business model that we really like that we also note the stock is up and again from a competitive perspective.
BEAR14|We just seen a lot of other models that have been disruptive that had much higher most then they have.
NEUT15|The Moat here is is is not quite as big as I think most think.
NEUT16|In your note, Brent which you titled Keep this one in the Kennel.
NEUT17|So one of those puns was in fact yours nicely done.
NEUT18|You know, that just 14% of US pet food and supply spending is done on line, which is.
NEUT19|Staggering to me that tells me that an Amazon which has the auto ship sort of feature when you run out of something at the end of the month, it automatically ships to you that an Amazon can easily step in.
BEAR20|A Walmart can easily step in and ****** that business away from Chewy.
NEUT21|I don't really understand what mode, if any, chewy really does have.
NEUT22|Melissa, it's a good point, you know, even on Amazon, if you add more than five items to your basket, you even get a larger discount on on the recurring revenue model.
NEUT23|So I think you know Amazon cares.
NEUT24|Obviously Chewy CEO came out of Amazon.
NEUT25|I think it was strategically a smart decision by the board to bring an ex Amazon executive.
NEUT26|Who knows the playbook.
NEUT27|Again, this market is big, the there's plenty of runway for multiple vendors in this market and they think again this consumerization of pets is happening.
NEUT28|But again, I agree I. I do think there's a Moat.
NEUT29|When you look at the Net Promoter scores, you look at the customers that I speak to my friends that use this product love it and they have no reason to switch.
NEUT30|There are also doing things to differentiate the model.
NEUT31|They're getting the pharmacy we think over time they could create digital marketplaces you think about as much money as you spend for your your your bird food.
NEUT32|How?
NEUT33|How much time and money does it take to actually watch the bird, the cat or the dog when you're on vacation?
NEUT34|It's a lot more expensive than the food.
NEUT35|So there's other things you can do around pet care around.
NEUT36|You know long term care, there's other digital pieces to this model they can introduce that would effectively be higher margin that aren't in the model today.
NEUT37|They could also ship them or their own product sales versus selling others that are at a lower margin.
BEAR38|"So there are definitely levers so it's hard to get really negative, but it's also hard for us to to be really positive given given the magnitude of the move since the IPO."""
