NEUT0|"""Joining us for more."
BULL1|AMC Entertainment CEO Adam Aron Adam Great to see you as always thanks so much for joining us.
NEUT2|Do you feel hard done by by the latest stimulus bill?
NEUT3|Well.
BEAR4|Our Congress has certainly done no favors for AMC Entertainment, the largest movie theater chain in the world.
NEUT5|I think there is a bias in Washington towards helping small business and assuming that big business will rely on self help and take care of itself.
NEUT6|But that is what AMC has been doing.
BEAR7|If you go back to last March when we had to shut all of our theaters globally and our revenues fell literally to zero overnight.
BULL8|We found ourselves in a position where to survive this pandemic.
NEUT9|We would need to raise capital.
NEUT10|We did that in April.
NEUT11|We did that again in July.
NEUT12|We did that again in October.
BULL13|We've done that again in December, so our strategy without any bailouts or congressional help is to do what we can to raise capital to lengthen our financial runway to get to the other side of this pandemic.
NEUT14|Are there any further steps you would be willing to take?
NEUT15|You even welcome Adam.
NEUT16|In terms of strategic partnerships.
NEUT17|No, that's not in the cards.
NEUT18|What are, at least for now.
NEUT19|I mean, you never say never to anything right, but right now, our strategy has been very clear and quite transparent.
NEUT20|With the market dating back to last spring number one, if our theaters were to reopen, we wanted to make sure that they opened safely.
NEUT21|So we created a new safety protocols called AMC Saving Clean, which we did in cooperation with faculty from Harvard University's very prestigious school, public Health and 2nd secure the capital.
NEUT22|We need to make it the other side.
NEUT23|Now I need to be absolutely clear.
BULL24|Just last month we said that we needed to raise at least $750 million to make it to the other side of this pandemic.
NEUT25|And we're not there yet.
BULL26|Having said that, we did raise $204 million in the first two weeks of that effort.
NEUT27|So we're off to a very good start, but we have a long way to go.
BULL28|We will need to raise more capital to make it to the other side.
NEUT29|Yeah, I mean I was just going to ask Adam just from a pure solvency standpoint.
BULL30|Are you guys going to be able to survive this?
BULL31|Well, we are working as intently and cleverly as we know how we have proven over the past ten months.
BULL32|That we are resilient, resourceful and creative bunch here at AMC.
BULL33|As I said, we raised money in April.
NEUT34|We raised money.
BULL35|In July we raised money.
NEUT36|In October we raise money in December.
NEUT37|In our filings last month we laid out a series of strategies that we've identified to raise the kind of money that we're going to need to make it to the other side.
NEUT38|And I can't make any comment about.
NEUT39|What will happen starting tomorrow?
NEUT40|But I can look back and I can tell you that in the first two weeks of our capital raising process that began in December, we raised $204 million.
BULL41|We need to raise more, but we're working hard to do that, and we've laid out a plan and a blueprint to get there.
NEUT42|Whether we get there or not, only time will tell.
BULL43|But certainly the steps that have been achieved so far are good first steps towards that end.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
