NEUT2|This is the best other than Tesla.
NEUT3|I you know, I think it's.
NEUT4|I look at when you've taken a brand like we have from kind of, you know, from the grave and rebuilt it over the last 20 years.
NEUT5|You know it's it's just you know it becomes, it's it's.
NEUT6|It's an evolving story and you have to really pay attention to it and you.
NEUT7|You wind up kind of be being haunted by your past.
NEUT8|You know your past self so people remember the old restoration hardware they hang on to old memories and it's hard for them to kind of see you differently.
NEUT9|That's why we say we have to create a forced reconsideration of our brand and who we are in all levels to the consumers from product.
NEUT10|POV From you know, from a street point of view, from an investor point of view.
NEUT11|But you know, overtime you know people will get it.

NEUT20|Aspen, so I'm buying or front porch furniture from RH now.
NEUT21|She's never seen the houses I hear from your cops.
NEUT22|Cool people are buying that.
NEUT23|Wanna buy the houses and they have seen houses now that is a brand that is the brand I'm looking for.
NEUT24|Yeah, The funny thing is we haven't even designed the houses and we've had multiple inquiries and we've had people actually make real offers sight unseen so that surprised us.
NEUT25|But but I think you know, look over time we like stay inside our company.
NEUT26|It's not what we say.
NEUT27|It's what we do that defines us right?
NEUT28|And our work will define us.
NEUT29|Our truth will define us.
NEUT30|We don't have a we don't have a marketing Department.
NEUT31|We have a truth group and you know, we say just focus on the work.
NEUT32|Do great work and overtime people will recognize that and respect that and and it takes a long time to build a great brand so you know this is this week was my 20th year anniversary.
