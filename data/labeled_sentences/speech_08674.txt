BEAR0|"""How's it going buddy to intrude here?"
NEUT1|Aunties video looking at XSP.
NEUT2|But before we get into it, I want to let you guys know that I did call it out in my StockTwits room.
NEUT3|You guys are welcome to join.
NEUT4|Link will be in the description box down below in the comments section.
NEUT5|Let's get right into it.
NEUT6|Crazy move.
NEUT7|Had almost 76 million shares of volume traded today which is great not to be underestimated.
NEUT8|First support we'd never at a dollar and Dollar 03.
BULL9|You have some support.
NEUT10|Their first resistance will be in $1.14.
NEUT11|It looks good for after hours.
BULL12|We could see a push up.
NEUT13|No specific news today.
NEUT14|Take a look at the Hard Day Church here.
NEUT15|You'll see that yesterday's video I mentioned that we had a bull Pennant forming and we're going to see a Bolt push up or a push down in likely will push up.
NEUT16|But now these questions, can it hold a dollar and can it break $1.20?
NEUT17|Is that would be the second resistance right there?
BEAR18|And I do think it will because of the volume pressure was so high today and some good news from the past and PR may be dropping soon if slash when this breaks.
NEUT19|You do have more resistance at 140, one 55166 and right there at 175.
BULL20|That's the the high of the four hour chart.
BULL21|Take a look back at the one day here V WAP is on your side as it will move up as the price does.
BULL22|That would also be a great support.
NEUT23|Now the question is, will there be more continuation?
BULL24|And I think there will be an.
BEAR25|I think that because of the pressure dependent that has reformed and potential news.
BULL26|Thanks guys for watching those access PA makes you guys are subscribed.
NEUT27|Questions come to Prince drop down below and give the video like I'll see in the next one.
NEUT28|"Later guys."""
