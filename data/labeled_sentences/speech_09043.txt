BULL0|"""Hi thanks so much for taking our questions."
NEUT1|I wanted to ask if the Fed is planning on extending the same restrictions on bank dividends and share repurchases.
BEAR2|I'm sorry.
NEUT3|Share repurchases that are currently in place into the second quarter.
NEUT4|And if you're considering at all the scenario analysis and mid cycle stress tests that were in place last year this year and kind of what would make you consider doing something like that again.
NEUT5|So we haven't made a decision on that.
BEAR6|We're a couple weeks away from announcing that decision.
NEUT7|Then I won't foreshadow it here.
NEUT8|Today I will say we're going to continue our data driven approach.
NEUT9|You know that we restricted buybacks and dividends.
BULL10|Capital through 2020, the banks actually increased their level of capital and their level of reserves in the December stress tests showed that banks are strong and well capitalized under hypothetical recessions.
NEUT11|That we that we use in December, which were quite stringent or right in the middle of our 2021 stress test and will release those results before the end of June.
NEUT12|And that layer is very significant.
BEAR13|Additional stress on top of the stress of the banks have already absorbed over the past year.
BEAR14|With the unemployment rate going to 11% and stock prices falling more than 50% so.
NEUT15|But all of that you know, the results of the stress test and the decision on distributions.
NEUT16|"All of that is to come fairly soon."""
