NEUT0|"""Let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see here.
BULL2|Apple has formed a green candle with the breakout of the pullback.
NEUT3|So after two days pull back away.
NEUT4|Finally confirm that we are still in the afternoon channel.
BULL5|But if we check the price level, we can see we are well.
NEUT6|Below the form, Ohio here is made on the 13th of October.
NEUT7|So before we break out from this level.
BEAR8|I can see here we still got some problem because if we check the volume here is very small.
BEAR9|That means the uptrend strength is not strong enough, especially after two days setting today's buying power is not so strong compared to the selling model.
NEUT10|So in my opinion with the small upper tail and the small volume is still should be careful before we break out from here.
BULL11|"Thank you."""
