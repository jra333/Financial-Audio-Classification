NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol RIOT."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, very nice movement on this one today, so definitely some updates need to be done first.
NEUT4|Thing to do is little house cleaning.
NEUT5|Go ahead and get rid of these lines down here.
NEUT6|Sure, those levels still pretending that they're just not relevant right now.
NEUT7|And from a presentation standpoint I don't want to risk causing confusion and clutter 'cause there's lines are really look, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible with the 1st update that does need to be made comes about based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of resistance are broken and closed above you want to see them act as support, so going in the day that level right there around the 50 ish dollar Mark was that area of resistance.
BULL8|But now that the price is up above that area.
NEUT9|That would now be considered in a level of support.
NEUT10|What I would call the ideal level.
BULL11|We say you know, won't make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and certainly if the price can stay above 50.
BEAR12|With that being said though, it's not like if the price falls below 50, that implies the entire charge destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL13|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture.
NEUT15|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT16|The 50.
NEUT17|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT18|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT19|Which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT20|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT21|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT22|Heard most visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT24|Yes and above, the $50 mark would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance.
NEUT25|Next level to watch very closely going to be right here at $52.75 and then the next main level after that, can be that pink line up there.
NEUT26|The very well known, the very famous 200.
BULL27|Moving average currently valued at 5575, but on all very nice movement today, so it'll be interesting to see if the price can continue to build on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT38|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT40|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT41|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT42|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
