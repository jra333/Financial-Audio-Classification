NEUT0|"""Innovation."
NEUT1|We always always hit you up about you know non carb snacks and things but what is the beyond meat?
NEUT2|What what's the goal to use beyond meat for snacks?
NEUT3|Describe it for me and we put a lot of salt on whatever it is that that might be enough right there.
NEUT4|Yeah, I think we're going to look at that as a as a very healthy setup of snacks.
NEUT5|And it's obviously based in plant based protein, which is terrific.
NEUT6|We're looking to develop a variety of product.
NEUT7|Still with the folks at Beyond Meat and then put it obviously on the Harbor operating system.
NEUT8|So I know you've been asking you for a long time.
NEUT9|What about a protein based snack?
NEUT10|In fact, I think internally we may refer to this is project burning, so I think we've got something for you.
NEUT11|You're really going to be excited about as we bring it out to the marketplace.
NEUT12|That's all you're going to tell me.
NEUT13|It's called Project Kern and I'm going to be excited.
NEUT14|But you're not going to United say anything beyond that.
NEUT15|It's not.
NEUT16|I don't know bout pork rinds there, too greasy.
NEUT17|I don't you gotta come up with.
NEUT18|Maybe they're beyond meat.
NEUT19|Pork, right?
NEUT20|I don't know.
NEUT21|Can you give me a hint?
NEUT22|These are going to be delicious.
NEUT23|They're going to be healthy, and they're going to be plant based.
NEUT24|That's all.
NEUT25|I'm ready to talk about right now.
NEUT26|Don't go too **** ** the H on the health part of it.
NEUT27|I can you know anything in moderation?
NEUT28|How about beverage innovation?
NEUT29|It's never ending.
NEUT30|What is that still going to be a major part of our Indian acquisitions and everything else?
NEUT31|Are you where you want to be?
BULL32|But in terms of acquisitions, I think we're where we want to be right now.
BULL33|We've been pretty active over the last couple of years with the Soda Stream acquisition, which is done terrifically well for us.
BULL34|We recently acquired Rock Star in the beverage business, and we're getting that business turned around after after a slow start, but we're excited about where we said.
BULL35|I think you'll see something in the energy space for Mountain Dew going forward that that'll be pretty exciting.
NEUT36|And if I as I look some of the recent data, recent.
NEUT37|Innovation the Gatorade 0 product which we really just launched out of.
NEUT38|Nothing actually did over a billion dollars in sales this past year, so I think you'll continue to see if there were more in beverages, particularly in lower calorie beverages where the consumer is going to.
