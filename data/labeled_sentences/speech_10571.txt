NEUT0|"""It's going to be one of the key stories of next week gym, not just the EU summit over the weekend, but Congress getting to work on stimulus five."
BEAR1|There seems to be a brewing tug of war between Mnuchin and Kudlow about whether the White House would demand a payroll tax cut as part of it.
BEAR2|How much of the 600 gets reduced per week, so that's going to be key, right?
NEUT3|Oh, boy, that look at Dan come August, they gotta give us something because we need a bridge to the bridge to the vaccine, and it's got to be the mask.
NEUT4|And it's gotta be stimulus, David.
NEUT5|The idea.
NEUT6|The payroll tax cut that Larry likes.
BULL7|You know that benefits you and me.
BEAR8|It's not not well, no, I don't know how that.
NEUT9|I don't know how that and it doesn't get into the economy that quickly.
NEUT10|I don't get that one, you know, but it's like.
BEAR11|Jim, how many people are going to face potential eviction when those moratoriums are up and when they are no longer receiving the $600 additional benefit from unemployment?
BEAR12|Mentions country, you're going to be at at that level because I think the numbers are staggering and very scary.
NEUT13|You are so I don't know what it means.
NEUT14|They look, the banks can well it can offer forbearance but in it.
NEUT15|But a company that has a mortgage that's that is renting apartments, they can offer forbearance.
NEUT16|They gotta kick him out, wow.
BEAR17|Some of the census household survey data yesterday guys suggested that I think it's 22 million households said they were not confident of being able to meet next month's rent.
NEUT18|It kind of points to what Larry Fink told the guys on Squawk Box this morning about the recovery being a lot more muted.
BULL19|They believe than than consensus might suggest.
NEUT20|Here's what Larry said.
NEUT21|Black Rock has never believed we're going to have shaped economy, you know, we believe this is going to be a slower, more persistent rebound.
BULL22|But we do believe there is a rebound.
NEUT23|But it's just going to take longer.
NEUT24|Kind of fits with a lot of the commentary this week.
NEUT25|Jim yeah, but Larry is very thoughtful is I wish we could have a transcript of the things he said.
NEUT26|I found Larry the most important thing was that he said that a lot of money was taken out with this with this market.
BULL27|It means that a dip is going to be met by new money, which is kind of extraordinary.
BEAR28|People pulled out money in that last week of March.
NEUT29|David member.
NEUT30|I think there were people came on our air in the last week of March and they were somewhat naked.
NEUT31|Yes, I do remember that.
BEAR32|Bill Ackman, Mr Qeynos yeah, that was not great timing.
NEUT33|No?
NEUT34|Then it would proximal Aranha had.
NEUT35|Yeah, there was a lot of.
NEUT36|Lot of lot of negativity at that point in terms of the market now, by the way, their view of the economy end up may end up being correct, but certainly their view of what would happen to the stock market has not been right.
NEUT37|And I think that there is a classic chasm between what the stock market is doing except for the banks this week and what the economy is doing.
NEUT38|But that's not unusual.
NEUT39|I mean people don't understand that if you're buying Z scaler and you're buying opt in.
NEUT40|If you're buying Palo Alto networks in your buying Fortnite, you're buying that because of something that happened at Twitter or you buy PayPal because there's something secular that's happening in the bank.
NEUT41|I mean, I mentioned watch.
NEUT42|Active on Twitter because Oct has been that's a company that does identity.
NEUT43|Does identity wasn't that what the problem is with Twitter?
NEUT44|"Go bring out opt in."""
