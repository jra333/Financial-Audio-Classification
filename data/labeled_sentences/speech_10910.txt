NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock you can see from this chart."
NEUT1|This is a daily chart.
NEUT2|It's a one day price we can see from the beginning from the opening of the market.
NEUT3|Here it's a nearly a flat.
NEUT4|For the price, so when it go around 2:00 o'clock PM, in your trading time, it dropped and dropped, but at the end of the market and it will need closeout market.
BULL5|It bounced a little bit back with huge volume.
BEAR6|So in my opinion is still a bearish sign for Apple stock because there's not so much buying in during the training time especially.
BEAR7|At the closing of the market is very bearish side and the reason for its bounce back at the end of the market is full.
NEUT8|The institution to.
NEUT9|To make it higher, to make it easy to distribute tomorrow.
NEUT10|So if we change the chart to six months and one candle represent one day, then we can see clearly here it's a green candle.
NEUT11|But we can see this green candle when it touched the.
NEUT12|EMS above it it stopped and also it has a upper tail.
NEUT13|It means there's resistance there.
NEUT14|And another thing is that we can see the lower part of this candle is lower than.
BULL15|The law of yesterday, so it makes us a new law, a lower low compared to yesterday, and it had approached the law.
BULL16|Made on the 21st of September, so it's very likely that Apple can dropped a little bit.
BEAR17|No, and if it appears this price does 103 and $0.10 if it dropped below this price, it will be very bearish for.
NEUT18|Apple stock and it's very likely to get here.
NEUT19|So in my opinion it will very likely get to the 97.
NEUT20|So in my opinion you should hold your money and don't.
NEUT21|Go back to U.S. stock markets so.
NEUT22|Early so that you will save your money.
BULL23|"Thank you."""
