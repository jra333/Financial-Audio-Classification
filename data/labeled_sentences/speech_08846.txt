NEUT0|"""Donald's of A1 Capital Partners came on closing Bell at the end of 2019."
NEUT1|He gave us his top five picks for 2020, leaning on the tech sector as he so often does.
NEUT2|He picked names like AMD, Disney, Facebook, Lumentum, an NVIDIA with an average year to date performance of 60%.
NEUT3|Let's bring down Niles in and find out exactly what he's picking for next year.
NEUT4|But damn, before we get to those picks for 2021, just give us your thinking of why you picked.
NEUT5|Those five names.
NEUT6|Great pics by the way, the average returns 60% if you'd help them throughout the year.
BULL7|I know you've traded in and out a bit but but what was your thinking this time last year for those names and I guess you'd have to say that an element of that return was a bit of luck given the sort of stay at home economy, which I guess you couldn't have predicted the extent of.
NEUT8|Yeah, I mean you have luck and you have you know problems as well.
NEUT9|'cause for obviously Disney shutting down all their parks movies wasn't great and so you have sort of this combination and I think the nice thing about last year is especially for a name like Facebook for example it held in really well even though we went through a recession and obviously advertising drops quite a bit during recession, but there was enough money going into the Internet economy that their advertising revenues actually held in really well.
NEUT10|So it was a great acid test as I like to call it.
BULL11|For a lot of these names and how sturdy their business models were, and so that actually makes me feel pretty good about those names.
NEUT12|And last year, the reason why we liked a lot of these names as we thought they were cheap, we thought they had good growth in front of them and that turned out to be the case.
NEUT13|And as you mentioned or Sarah mentioned, I think in the lead in you know if you look at this year, our picks are actually there's only about one tech name in there and the rest of them are really outside that sector where we think there's a lot better values to be found.
NEUT14|Search for your 5 picks.
NEUT15|This year.
NEUT16|JP Morgan, the Xle Energy ETF, Magna International Oracle and GN limited.
NEUT17|Gan Limited, will go through those five names individually in a moment.
NEUT18|But talk us through why that pivot away from tech towards signals out of out of the core tech sector for a couple of the names, which is not typical view.
NEUT19|Yeah, I mean I think when you.
NEUT20|When you think about the markets, a lot of this comes down to a very big picture view we have, which is inflation really hasn't been in existence.
NEUT21|Arguably for the last decade.
BULL22|And if you look at where prices are right now for a lot of different commodities, so you look at zinc or copper or nickel, they're up over 20% year to date in the middle of a recession.
BULL23|If you look at food pricing around things like we or corn, that's up 10% plus as well, and even high priced items like.
BULL24|Homes are up, I think 7% year to date and used cars are up 17% year to date now this hasn't shown up in the inflation numbers, but when you look at 10 year Treasurys they started the year at 1.9% there now at .9%.
BULL25|But I think if you see economies open up next year which I firmly believe they will wouldn't surprise me to see 10 year Treasuries go well above 2% which most people aren't looking at right now.
NEUT26|And so if you believe inflation is already here today.
NEUT27|What happens when economies reopen that changes your playbook on what you want to look at and tech stocks like low interest rates because they're long duration assets and without getting too geeky on it.
NEUT28|You know, DCF multiples, like very low interest rates to discount those future growth that goes up, then those become a lot less attractive relative to names that benefit from higher rates like banks for example.
NEUT29|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT30|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
