NEUT0|"""Coming into this print today, this was the view from Barclays."
NEUT1|They were looking for durability in the US labor market, but they were still looking for 75 basis points of cuts this year.
NEUT2|They said the following.
BULL3|There's enough durability and labor markets, enough of a services oriented economy where weakness in manufacturing and trade have difficulty tipping the economy over.
BEAR4|One of the reasons we're not calling for anything worse is because we think there's still some virtuous cycle in labor markets left to go.
NEUT5|That was the optimism before the print.
NEUT6|Is it still there?
NEUT7|Barclays chief US economist Michael Gapen joins us now.
NEUT8|So my account was answered a question.
NEUT9|What's your view now?
NEUT10|Is it changed?
BEAR11|Yeah, that's not fair.
NEUT12|Yeah, so obviously the number today.
NEUT13|If you look at the one month number cast some doubt on what I just said.
BEAR14|I agree with Anastasia, the numbers are suggesting weakness in manufacturing industrial production.
NEUT15|The cyclical side of the economy having goods producing sectors and employment in those sectors go to 0 is what happened in 15 and 16 so that side of the report isn't a surprise.
BEAR16|The services payroll numbers today won't get it done.
NEUT17|The three month average is Rick set is probably more in tune with this so.
BEAR18|Yeah, obviously today's report is a little inconsistent with with what I said.
NEUT19|But yeah, our view is that it is hard to tip the US economy over if it's just a slowdown in manufacturing.
NEUT20|So this is a really important point.
NEUT21|I might be certainly not trying to play got you here on Bloomberg.
NEUT22|I want you to go through the details more broadly for the this U.S. economy.
BEAR23|The ADP report earlier in the week just spoke to the anxiety goods producing areas of the economy, not doing so well.
NEUT24|Services OK, we actually still see this in Europe to you think that could remain the trend for the next 12 months or so.
NEUT25|That's your base case.
BULL26|It's the base case with sufficient monetary policy easing that comes into to stabilize confidence.
BEAR27|I think the monetary policy setting is too tight given weakness in global growth, escalating trade tensions, and so forth.
BEAR28|I'm not sure we need tariffs to go into place to get things to slow down the April data industrial production, durables, orders, advanced trade, all that took our tracking estimate for equipment spending into negative territory for for the month.
BEAR29|That's what really got me worried more than a tweet on.
BEAR30|"The trade it was that April data on manufacturing and industrial production that suggested much more broad based weakness in business spending and that's what took our numbers down."""
