NEUT0|"""Hi, this is Mike Riedmiller coming to you from Austin, TX."
NEUT1|That investment conference.
NEUT2|I recently wrote a couple articles for Forbes.
NEUT3|One was regarding longevity risks, the other was about the stock market.
NEUT4|May be the time to diversify.
NEUT5|Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard.
NEUT6|You might be familiar with that.
NEUT7|From the index funds he was quoted a few years back as saying investors should be prepared for at least one or two.
BEAR8|Major market declines in the coming decades.
NEUT9|Now you think about what that might look like for your portfolio?
BEAR10|What's a major market decline?
BEAR11|Well, that might be a decline of 20 or 30 or 40% or even more.
NEUT12|Something like we saw in 2008.
NEUT13|I think it was more Twain that was quoted as saying, history does not necessarily repeat itself, but it oftentimes will rhyme.
NEUT14|So that's a question you've got to ask yourself.
NEUT15|How is your portfolio prepared for the next major stock stock market move, especially if it's downward.
NEUT16|Hey, let's chat soon.
BULL17|"Let's make sure that you have some readiness or or somewhat prepared for that, and have a financial plan in place."""
