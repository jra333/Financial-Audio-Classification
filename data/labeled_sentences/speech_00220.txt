NEUT0|"""Let's talk a little bit about PLTR stock today, so this talk right here has been on my radar for quite awhile."
NEUT1|I've been investing in it for a long time, ever since it was right around $14.00 a share.
NEUT2|I actually bought PLT or stock around the $16.00 mark an I held PLT or until around the $44 mark.
NEUT3|And then I sold it and then I'm now looking to get a new position back in PLT Rustock.
NEUT4|Remember guys, I'm not a financial advisor, is for entertainment purposes only.

NEUT7|I'll second that notification bail and will notify you when I upload a new video and only around 5% of you guys are actually subscribed to my channel.
NEUT8|I watched my videos today on PLT or stock.
BEAR9|We have seen a downfall of around 5.7% on the stock price.
NEUT10|Today's volume four POTR stock is right around 57 million with an average 10 day volume of 60.893 million.
NEUT11|The market cap is 39.71 billion which is huge for PLT or stock.
BULL12|As PTR is going to be a great company to hold long term and it is one that you should potentially hope for a long long time.
NEUT13|Their next earnings report will be made 13th.
NEUT14|So now before I go from my price prediction, also my analysis on PLT or I kind of want to go over some news on PLT or stock nearing quarter four PLT or brought in sales totaling around 322,000,000.
BEAR15|However, earnings decreased 81.53%, resulting in a loss of 156 Pop 5 seven million plantar technologies collected 289.37 million in revenue during quarter three, but reported earnings showed around 847.78 million loss.
BEAR16|So it looks like this time around in quarter four that they did not have as big of a loss overall than they have in quarter three.
BULL17|PLT are reported quarter 4 earnings per share at .06 per share, which beat analyst predictions of .02 per share.
BEAR18|PLT our CEO Alex Karp, on Tuesday criticized Wall Street, saying it's put too much emphasis on near term gains.
BEAR19|He says one of the most destructive attributes open, otherwise interesting and largely functioning system.
NEUT20|The comments were made at an event hosted by the executives.
NEUT21|Clubs of Chicago and that is something that is big as the CEO was saying that you need to really hold this for the long term, as I do think you do gotta hold just for the long term as recently ever since the IPO back in September of 2020.
BULL22|This company right here is going to be one that is great because they do got contracts for the army.
NEUT23|They also have for the United Kingdom's health care.
BULL24|As I do think PLT or stock is going to be good for the long term.
NEUT25|As I mentioned earlier, I will give you my analysis and we are sitting right at around a support of 2172.
NEUT26|We have multiple resistance at 2504, twenty, 454, and 2384.
NEUT27|These are some numbers he should take a look at if you're looking to invest into PLT or stock.
NEUT28|As of today, we're breaking a lot of the sports, but I think that we eventually bounce back out as today.
BEAR29|The stock market overall is completely red.
BULL30|I do think that I'm going to keep holding this stock and look for a good buying opportunity for PLT.
NEUT31|Our stock and if you guys have it make sure you get 2 free stocks when you pause $100 using link down below with Weibull.
NEUT32|And now I'm going to give you my price target 4 PLT or stock.
NEUT33|PLTR price target for me at the end of 2021 is going to be around the 30 to the $40 range.
NEUT34|It is going to be somewhere around there.
BULL35|I think it'll consolidate around the 25 to $30 range once we eventually break out.
NEUT36|Probably sometime in quarter two or quarter three.
BULL37|I do think PLT or stock could go further than 30 to $40 long term, but they do need to keep up with the contracts and there SAA system.
