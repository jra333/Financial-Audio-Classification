NEUT0|"""11 by the Yeets Jack McGinn and Good morning."
NEUT1|And thanks for watching this quick video an update on Aston Martins talk.
NEUT2|So in front of us, there is one hour candle stick showing that the prices be moving inside the channel so there is not any trained so it's not good for us traded that we would like at least personally I would like to follow up always a train.
NEUT3|In the end I would like to invest always in the trend direction to reduce the risks.
NEUT4|So as it as we are right now we don't know what to do.
NEUT5|So the best option is just too old.
NEUT6|As well As for Bentley, four or so is that they did before taking analysis or sources, not just in the automakers business payroll, also in.
NEUT7|In let's say or, you know either Craftsman business so they produce engines for big aircraft.
NEUT8|So, but both businesses, car automakers, or, you know, flight makers or flight companies.
BEAR9|So even you know I craftmaker, those two businesses are really in not in a good shape right now.
NEUT10|So if you want to compare us to market with their own source, it's not really fair, but they are.
NEUT11|Behaving in the same way sideways, and it seems that that we don't know what to do, so this is.
NEUT12|I mean there are not enough signal to see what to do.
NEUT13|The stock price is.
NEUT14|The shed is very good so soon and only there those talk they need.
NEUT15|They will go up for sure.
NEUT16|But as we are now for the short term investment, best option is just too old, even if it's in stochastic market.
NEUT17|Going out.
NEUT18|So for a short term there is an opportunity to go up, but we don't know yet because I think the price can keep moving inside the channel.
NEUT19|Before going up, we're just the prices are just taking all the extent and informations of the second or third wave of coronavirus.
NEUT20|Once those information is swell, well, absorb it well understood by those prices.
NEUT21|Setting this talk as well as others, they will start going up again, but for now just hold because we are a sideways and there are not a lot of signal of buying or selling.
NEUT22|"Thanks bye."""
