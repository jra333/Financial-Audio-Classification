NEUT13|This is video 4 of 19 for the upgraded stack series to watch from the beginning click on the link in the description below.
NEUT14|Let me pull up my notes here now.
NEUT15|Ship first of all is not making money.
NEUT16|I do not like to buy stocks that are not making money most of the time, but it's important to understand that they are not making money analyst price target.
NEUT17|$1.50 a share.
NEUT18|You you have a Yahoo price target $1.50 a share.
BULL19|Seanergy Maritime Holdings announced today that was entered into definitive definitive agreement with an unaffiliated third part of your purchase of modern Capesize vessel.
BULL20|The vessel, upon delivery of the acquisition as well as previously announced vessel purchases, the size of the company's fleet will increase to 15 capsized vessels with an aggregate cargo capacity of approximately.
NEUT21|2.65 DWT.
BEAR22|Cargo companies, especially right now have been hit pretty hard from the coronavirus.
BULL23|They do expect this stack to move up to about $1.50 from the analyst.
NEUT24|There's a lot to go into here.
NEUT25|Do your research.
NEUT26|Personally.
BULL27|I think this does have the potential to go from a dollar where it stands today.
NEUT28|That would be the buy target, right about a dollar for dollar six where it is up to price target of about $1.50.
NEUT29|I think it can see that, but I think it's also a more speculative play.
NEUT30|Interesting one.
NEUT31|Definitely want to keep an eye on.
BULL32|Thanks for watching.
NEUT33|"We'll see you on the next one."""
