NEUT0|"""What's up stuck Sky today we're talking about Junior."
NEUT1|Show me a strange day around this $37.
NEUT2|Up and down.
BULL3|It's swinging and I've been building my position on this one and I think I'm going to get more of these stocks because right now it's trading at 37.
BEAR4|But if you look at the week it dropped to 33 and then it's recovering has been recovering recovering.
BEAR5|If you look at the month it was way down from 47.
NEUT6|So I think right now is a good entry point.
BULL7|If it drops a little bit more, it will be even better.
NEUT8|But I'm going to have at least 150 shares in this one.
NEUT9|Because I believe he's going to go to 50 soon.
BULL10|"Anne, thanks guys for watching."""
