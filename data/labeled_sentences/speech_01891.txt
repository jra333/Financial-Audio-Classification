BEAR0|"""Stocks like Netflix are skyrocketing and segments are."
NEUT1|Bob Mcclurg tells us if their stocks are worth their weight in gold.
NEUT2|Sky rocketing is actually probably a very good way to describe stocks like Netflix because they can go through the roof and they can generate huge amount of profit.
BULL3|And they can also crash back to Earth, leaving you with nothing so far year to date, the S&P 500 is up a little over 8%.
BULL4|Netflix is up over 30% more than three times as much, but The thing is, Netflix is a new company.
NEUT5|It's not like they went into a new business at someone else.
NEUT6|Or a business that was already established.
NEUT7|They started a new industry entirely.
NEUT8|Video streaming is not something that has been done here to four and certainly hasn't been done profitably.
NEUT9|Like to do this morning's talk.
NEUT10|A little bit about the competitors that have sprung up to try and take some of that market share away from Netflix.
NEUT11|And it's a very interesting thing because most of these competitors are really conglomerations of other companies.
NEUT12|Let's look at one of them.
NEUT13|You've probably gone to the grocery store, Encino's green kiosks that.
NEUT14|Called Coinstar Coin Star is a parent company of another company.
NEUT15|Red Box Red Box is where you can get those videos via the kiosk and actually red box is one of the companies that help put blockbuster out of business.
NEUT16|The thing is Coinstar and Redbox, Redbox have teamed up with Verizon.
NEUT17|For digital streaming, so now they're trying to move into the same space.
NEUT18|Is Netflix to figure out if they're going to be successful or not.
NEUT19|It's going to be pretty difficult because it's three companies that we're trying to look at.
NEUT20|Let's look at another one.
NEUT21|You probably know much better.
NEUT22|Hulu.
NEUT23|Hulu is actually the lovechild of Comcast, Disney, and News Corp.
NEUT24|I've wanted to say that for the longest time, The thing is, Hulu is part of three separate companies, but they don't have their own freestanding financials, so we can look at them and see how they're doing.
NEUT25|So who focuses only on first run TV shows as opposed to motion pictures?
NEUT26|The third competitor for Netflix, Amazon and Amazon.com.
NEUT27|We all know as online merchandise, but they also have gotten very big into video streaming, an audio streaming, and so all three of these competitors for Netflix have little niche markets that they're trying to expand into, but so far there's no single freestanding competitor to Netflix.
NEUT28|"So while they've sold about $5 billion in revenue over the last year, it's still hard to tell what the company is really worth."""
