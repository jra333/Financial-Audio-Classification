BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I won't talk about Yelp today, so we'll go over the irony of rating Yelp later, but.
NEUT2|Their current price is $32.67, which gives them a market cap of $2.4 billion.
NEUT3|Dividend is zero.
NEUT4|I don't expect that to change, especially with how they're running right now.
BEAR5|Revenue $1 billion slightly up earnings, $41 million slightly down, and they currently have P of 92 with a forward PE of 28.
BULL6|Obviously forward PE of 28 would be amazing if they could get there, but.
NEUT7|Current PE of 92 and trailing 12 months don't really look that much better so.
NEUT8|I have questions.
NEUT9|Total assets $1.1 billion.
BEAR10|Total liabilities $316 million, which gives them a total stockholders equity of $755 million and that is down significantly despite them having a profit, which I'm obviously never a fan of so.
NEUT11|Overall and risk factors being.
NEUT12|I don't like Yelp and I don't really know anyone who likes Yelp and with Google having their own rating thing and Facebook having their own rating thing and there's four square, I think and there's many others.
NEUT13|Overall, I'm not really sure if a stand alone rating thing is really a viable business idea at this point, and so I have questions about the whole business model.
NEUT14|It makes sense for Google with Google Maps and everything to like display ratings and it makes sense for Facebook where people check into things to have ratings and it makes sense for some other people.
NEUT15|But as a standalone thing I don't think Yelp is really worth it at this point so.
BULL16|That the whole business idea as a whole being not viable in my opinion, kind of makes this a moot point, but overall things look pretty decent.
NEUT17|Obviously no dividend is a problem for dividend investors.
BEAR18|Growth of five ISH percent is a problem for growth investors.
NEUT19|But for a value investor, if they can get to a forward PE of 28 which.
NEUT20|You know?
NEUT21|Not really sure about.
NEUT22|These stats would look pretty reasonable.
BULL23|The balance sheet is amazing.
BULL24|Revenue growth is.
BULL25|And evaluation with a P of 28 would be pretty decent.
NEUT26|So overall, if you were a value investor and if you did believe in Yelp actually having a place in the market, then I think it would be pretty interesting to look into them and maybe wait for the earnings of you know last year at this point.
NEUT27|So overall I would.
NEUT28|I would say value investor might be interested but everyone else.
NEUT29|Probably can't find anything interesting here.
NEUT30|That's it for me.
