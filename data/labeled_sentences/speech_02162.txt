NEUT0|"""Compass Minerals International policy MP."
BEAR1|Now this is a larious fall $2.1 billion market cap.
BULL2|Another small one I like get a P ratios a little high 26 so not terrible there OK profit margin though negative .74 last quarter they lossed .74% but in the last year their profit margins about 6% so still and exhaling #3 is revenue growth over the past five years Paul billion 1 billion one forty a billion 360 billion 5 billion five.
NEUT3|Check mark there.
NEUT4|How about profit growth?
BEAR5|Pillar #4 Paul 159 one 6240 three 6963X White their revenues up 50%, but their profits down the revenue from a billion one to a billion 5 of 40% and the profits down from 160 to 60 down.
BEAR6|So this is kind of a red flag about it.
NEUT7|We have to look at that pillar.
NEUT8|#5 is number of shares outstanding palm.
NEUT9|This is an act similarly 33.68 to 33.88.
NEUT10|So it is an ex Sara Lee but they are going up every single year in terms of number of shares outstanding.
NEUT11|Lot of ex is here but.
NEUT12|This might be an example of one that has Alexis that we're not saying that we're not necessarily saying no to Pillar #6 is current assets greater than current liabilities for this company, 685 million versus 301 million, so they have plenty on hand to pay their current bills.
NEUT13|What about what about total liabilities pulling the total liabilities is 1.8 billion.
BEAR14|I don't have enough to pay that off.
NEUT15|It's a lot, but we don't know if it's a lot.
NEUT16|I mean what?
NEUT17|What's that debt comprised of?
NEUT18|I have no idea.
NEUT19|They have a billion 5 in revenue and at 1.8 billion in liabilities, that doesn't seem like a ton, I don't.
NEUT20|I mean, these are things that they look at as ratios and thinking, understanding that I don't know this.
NEUT21|Season of Self will not tell me if it's good or bad.
NEUT22|It's about talking about industry understanding the industry, understanding the tenkiller #7 is free cash flow growth over the past five years and I won't screw up the calculation this time buddy.
NEUT23|Negative 80 negative 1537, then 37 + 37 + 90 + 6092 total divided by 5 is 18 guys.
BEAR24|This is a tough one for me.
BEAR25|The free cash flow is bad.
NEUT26|It's an act mean it's increasing someone from negative, so there's a check mark there, but the multiple is a big X.
NEUT27|You need to understand what's going on here, I don't know.
NEUT28|How they're generating their cash flow?
NEUT29|I'm not saying yes or no to this one.
NEUT30|You got to do a lot more research.
NEUT31|If you like the idea of the company then go for it.
NEUT32|This is not one that makes me scream.
NEUT33|Yes, it is not one minutes ago.
NEUT34|No.
NEUT35|If I were leaving anywhere, I'd be more no than yes.
BULL36|I mean, they probably better opportunities out there in other companies.
NEUT37|Is a free cash flows.
BEAR38|This garbage averaging 19 a year, even last year's 8020 times as a billion six is still overpriced, so I'm still not a buyer.
NEUT39|Even based on one years cash flow.
BEAR40|"But this one has such inconsistent cash flow you don't want to take one year and just deal with it."""
