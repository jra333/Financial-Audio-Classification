BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome."
NEUT1|This is Melissa Arma was the stock swoosh and I'm reviewing the gap today in Facebook.
NEUT2|Didn't do this out of the game.
NEUT3|Didn't see it right out of the gate.
BULL4|Ended up trading well at upgrading it later.
BULL5|As a matter of fact, rated 20 points was good enough to shore as a late train.
BEAR6|Though kind of make shifted it right in here Boom, Boom stock got the drop.
NEUT7|I really felt like 160 was a good target for this today 159 could have gotten there even 158 something lower than ended up being what one?
NEUT8|5929 good.
BULL9|Got close, got close to 159 but nice move here today in Facebook and Elite Rainboom more than a dollar an again.
NEUT10|If you play this out of the game, in fact, what did this do out of the game today?
NEUT11|I just didn't watch it and somebody brought it up in the room.
NEUT12|Then I was like wait a minute.
NEUT13|This is news.
NEUT14|This was an earnings.
BULL15|But it rated well.
NEUT16|So you gotta gotta give.
NEUT17|You gotta give the points when the points are given.
NEUT18|You could have been aggressive on this today, I I just didn't see this.
NEUT19|So.
NEUT20|One of the ones that I missed.
NEUT21|How much volume did this having this?
NEUT22|This was trading.
NEUT23|Yeah, it had volume I just I didn't even see it interesting.
NEUT24|So anyways, did see it later.
NEUT25|Someone mentioned in the room was looking for a later play.
NEUT26|Ann is still at Target in it and it all worked out, so we'll see where Facebook is headed.
NEUT27|Let's look at the daily chart.
BULL28|Really quick, but nice day trading here today.
BEAR29|Late called though I don't like the way this chart looks.
BEAR30|I don't like the way this looks at all.
NEUT31|This really wasn't a favorite of mine after the earnings, even though it gapped up and it popped up over the past 200 moving average.
NEUT32|That's true, but I didn't think this look great then.
NEUT33|And guess what it went absolutely nowhere.
NEUT34|So I'm going all the way back to the earnings that occur here back.
NEUT35|Data this was the 31st.
BEAR36|I mean honestly, it went absolutely nowhere after that zip, so to me this does not look great.
NEUT37|You could have they traded the short.
NEUT38|I don't know if this is lower on the long term here right now, but I definitely wouldn't be long this right now for.
NEUT39|I mean, I just would not.
NEUT40|I mean not the way this has traded since the earnings.
NEUT41|Not at all.
NEUT42|If this, if this is either selective Day trains right now or I would not be in it long overnight.
NEUT43|I mean there's just no reason to be here.
BEAR44|No, follow through the earnings and that's a bad sign for this.
NEUT45|So lots going on in Facebook and the last time this stock may brand new all time highs was all a very long time ago, July 2018.
NEUT46|So that's a long time ago in the life of this stock.
NEUT47|So we'll really have to be keeping watch at this Facebook, but it didn't drive the market down today, so that's very interesting, quite frankly.
NEUT48|So nicely calling this good luck everyone.
NEUT49|If you're interested in learning my gap method, we mostly look at shorts, email me and melissa@thestockswoosh.com next class is March 23rd and 24th.
BULL50|"Have a great day everyone."""
