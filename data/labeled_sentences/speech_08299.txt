NEUT0|"""Hey guys, this is the investors Chandler investors comfort stock recommendations and financial news and today we're going to talk about Disney and Netflix."
NEUT1|Now.
BEAR2|Many people think that since Disney created their new streaming service, people are going to cancel their Netflix subscriptions and just switch over to Disney.
NEUT3|But we'll see what happens in this video.
NEUT4|I want to share my opinion.
NEUT5|What I think is going to happen, whether people are going to keep Netflix switch to Disney.
NEUT6|So that being said, let's get started.
NEUT7|So the big question here is, will Netflix crash?
NEUT8|Meaning will Netflix go bankrupt the way Blockbuster did?
BEAR9|Is it going to lose off subscribers?
NEUT10|While many people are saying that Netflix is going to crash, you have investors saying that Netflix and Disney are actually going to go side by side.
NEUT11|Which I can see that happening because Netflix and HBO grew side by side.
NEUT12|Netflix had its own exclusive content, and HBO had its own exclusive content.
NEUT13|Also, today people bundle up with the streaming services.
NEUT14|Some people have Netflix, Hulu and HBO.
NEUT15|And I think when Disney comes up with their streaming service, people may bundle up with Netflix, Hulu and then Disney.
NEUT16|Because the platforms will probably have their own exclusive shows and people want to see it all.
NEUT17|People have the money they're willing to spend it, and they will ultimately be saving then more money than they would have if they just kept cable.
BEAR18|And they would have to see less ads as well.
NEUT19|In fact, right now Netflix has like around 100,000,000 subscribers.
NEUT20|So while they may not dominate the streaming service anymore, or be the most popular one, I think they will still be around and they will still have their own growth as long as they continue to add exclusive content like Stranger Things.
NEUT21|So while I personally think Netflix is overpriced and Disney is the better by people have money, so they're probably going to both.
NEUT22|And they have a lot of time as well.
NEUT23|And some people sure they will choose one or the other.
NEUT24|Many people may just choose Disney because they have everything they need on Disney's platform and it's cheaper.
NEUT25|Or some people may choose Netflix because they want specific shows and they may be willing to pay more for it anyways.
BEAR26|Guys, Netflix did raise their prices in the worst possible time, which is another reason why their stock went down.
NEUT27|If you want to hear more on the huge mistake that Netflix made, I'm going to link a video to that down below in description.
