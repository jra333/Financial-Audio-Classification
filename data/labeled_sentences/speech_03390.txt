BEAR0|"""The retirement of Manchester United's manager Alex Ferguson may be bad news for the clubs soccer players, but could it also be bad news for the clubs investors?"
BEAR1|Peter nurses hurts us white folks and is so tight up with the club success.
NEUT2|Peter Club was actually floated on New York Stock Exchange last August.
NEUT3|Why the New York Stock Exchange?
NEUT4|Well, initially the club was was going to be reflected in Singapore.
NEUT5|They have a very big fan base in that part of the world, but the market conditions at the time.
NEUT6|Wasn't going down very well, so they went and looked in New York.
NEUT7|Recent Obama had recently signed a JOBS Act, April 2012.
BULL8|I think it came into law and that cut the costs for smaller companies to IPO.
NEUT9|So there was a financial reason behind the other New York so can also.
NEUT10|It is owned by an American, largely pastoral Glazer 'cause he bought it back in 2005 for $1.47 billion, right?
NEUT11|That's correct, yes.
NEUT12|And he was meant to have taken on quite a lot of debt.
BEAR13|With that purchase, something which caused a few rankles among the Man United supporters.
NEUT14|OK, but how is the company done?
NEUT15|Basically since then whether the last results out last results were for this quarter and they've done very well, the stock itself was was floated at $14.00 a share.
NEUT16|It's now trading over $18.00 a share.
NEUT17|The company and made profits of over three and a half million pounds.
NEUT18|That's in dollars that by five or five and a half by 5.6.
BULL19|Yeah, yeah.
BULL20|So it's done very well with share.
BULL21|Prices appreciated substantially since its flotation.
NEUT22|OK so interesting 'cause of course Ferguson has been at the top of this global Manager discount for 25 years, so he really is intertwined with all its successes and losses here over 25 years.
NEUT23|In fact I think it's 27 is coming up to now, but but before he before he arrived the club had not won the League title in the in England that the major trophy for over 25 years.
BULL24|The club, the largest club in England had been indulgence.
BULL25|His arrival and subsequent success have been nothing short of a very impressive, because essentially what they have 1/13 of these titles down.
NEUT26|I mean what is now known as English Premier League.
BEAR27|He has one on the underhanded his manager.
NEUT28|He was one out on the field where under his management they have 1/13/20 and older.
BULL29|They recently achieved just two weeks ago.
NEUT30|So Ferguson goes who's going to replace the onshore?
NEUT31|There's lots of speculation.
NEUT32|Well it would be a really plum job for so there will be lots of people interested.
NEUT33|The main person who's been linked is.
NEUT34|You see Marino, the Real Madrid manager.
NEUT35|He he has said he wants to come back to the Premiership and the other person who's also being talked about is the Everton manager David Moyes.
BULL36|"Well it thank you Peter."""
