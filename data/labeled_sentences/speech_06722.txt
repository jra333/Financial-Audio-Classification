NEUT0|"""For this video, we're going to go over a trade setup that we had here in Netflix."
BEAR1|So you can see here we just had a down trending RSI trendline.
NEUT2|Now we're getting some red dots on the TTM squeeze, expecting to move one way or the other.
BULL3|You can see here it was actually forming a pretty nice wedge pattern here, but since it was holding above the 55 AM and we did have some port support lower at the VWAP here we also just repeating above the 21.
BULL4|May at the time of the breakout here, so that was our indication that they would probably be along, specially since 55 was acting as good support.
NEUT5|Here you can see here we had an earlier bounce off of it.
BULL6|Nice rally came back.
NEUT7|Almost retested it.
NEUT8|There didn't quite retested it here and then retested again here so some good bounces off of that.
BULL9|And yeah when we broke out of the RSI trendline here, we got the TTM squeeze follow through.
NEUT10|We're just holding above the 21 Ma and the 55 here using the 21 as our stop loss just in case price action came against it.
NEUT11|And you can see here we're not even really challenging the 21 for this little rally up here, just to measure what kind of game that was from the entry point here.
NEUT12|So it's currently trading around the 0.72% so nice double digit gain for some call options on Netflix here with the 70 deltas, so would move 70% for every.
NEUT13|Dollar that Netflix move.
BULL14|And since this was a good runner.
BULL15|Looks like some decent returns off of this set up here.
BULL16|And again, our main indication was the red dots forming on the idea 2 minutes here and along with the breakout of the wedge on the price pattern and the RSI trendline break looks like a decent set up and you can see that volume it was picking up along the way here starting really low and then just peeking out here.
BULL17|So great set up in Netflix.
BULL18|"Thanks for watching."""
