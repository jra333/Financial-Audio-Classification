NEUT0|"""However, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see during the day."
BULL1|Actually, the stock price nearly got study and a little bit sink at the 2:00 PM and then bounced back again and need closing on the market with increased volume.
NEUT2|That means somebody is buying in and if we change the charge into daily chart we can see.
NEUT3|Actually.
NEUT4|Here it formed a green candle after the drop of the two days before it.
BEAR5|As we said yesterday, that here is very unlikely for the price to drop further, 'cause it will cut the formal law and which is on.
NEUT6|Necessary for the stock because it's still.
BEAR7|In the long term uptrend, and in my opinion waste.
BEAR8|Decrease the volume here is very likely for the stock to find a bottom here, so if.
NEUT9|It's the case.
NEUT10|Then here will be the double bottom.
NEUT11|Here is 1 here the two.
NEUT12|So even though here is a double top pattern, but as long as the low kept above.
NEUT13|The former law.
BULL14|There's still possibility for Apple stock to have a double bottom here, so the volume is a good sign for the judgment.
BULL15|"Thank you very much."""
