NEUT0|"""Interest rates."
BEAR1|They've been near zero since the financial crisis.
BULL2|That's made it cheaper for everyone to borrow from banks to homeowners to car buyers.
BULL3|But as the economy improves, the Fed will want to raise interest rates to keep it from overheating.
NEUT4|Some of the tools the central bank used in previous decades to control rates don't work the way they used to, so the Fed has devised a new toolkit to push up rates and keep them in a desired range to set the scene for these tools, let's tell a tale of three banks.
NEUT5|The first is the Fed.
NEUT6|This is, of course, the Federal Reserve.
NEUT7|Next is big bank.
NEUT8|These are your Citibank's, your JP Morgans etc and finally home loans.
NEUT9|These are the Federal Home Loan banks that lend to places like Big Bank.
NEUT10|So now let's think of the world of interest rates as a skyscraper with an elevator in it that naturally goes up and down at the higher end is .25% and at the bottom .0%.
NEUT11|So let's say this higher level.
NEUT12|Is where the Fed keeps bank reserves.
NEUT13|Big Bank can put some of its money here and earn .25% interest from the Fed.
NEUT14|This rate is called the IOE.
NEUT15|Our interest on excess reserves.
NEUT16|Setting this rate is the Fed's primary new tool.
NEUT17|It's it's at the top of its range now.
NEUT18|Home Loan is a different kind of think it can't earn interest from the Fed by putting it here, but it can loan money to Big Bank.
NEUT19|It is willing to accept less than the .25% the Fed pays because doing so is a way for it to still earn money, so it loans money to Big Bank in this range.
NEUT20|That's good news for Big Bank because it can borrow from home loan and then turn around and park that money at the Fed earning interest and pocketing the difference.
NEUT21|These loans that home loan makes the big bank for most of the activity that occurs here in this range.
NEUT22|This is a market that determines the feds benchmark known as the Fed funds rate.
NEUT23|Think of this as the elevator.
NEUT24|When the Fed funds rate moves up or down, borrowing costs for you and me tend to follow along.
NEUT25|So let's say the Fed's new IO ER is .5%.
NEUT26|The idea is that this whole range moves up with it.
NEUT27|Now under this scenario, Big Bank earns .5% on reserves and the Fed funds rate is ideally supposed to sit in this new range of .25 two point 5%.
NEUT28|Here's the problem.
BULL29|Because home loan is willing to earn interest at a rate below .25%, the Fed funds rate might not always rise up into this new range.
NEUT30|So enter tool #2.
NEUT31|It's called the Reverse repo program.
NEUT32|This is still part of the Fed toolkit, but it's separate from IOR, so let's think of it as another building.
NEUT33|Reverse repose give home loan.
NEUT34|Another place to put its money and earn interest on it at a rate set by the Fed.
NEUT35|So let's say the Fed sets this rate at .25%, since any bar or that isn't the Fed is considered a riskier bet.
BULL36|the Fed expects that home loan will loan to Big Bank at a rate that's higher.
NEUT37|That's how the Fed sets the floor.
NEUT38|"It's a mix of market forces, an Fed monetary management coming together in an attempt to deal with the new economic era."""
