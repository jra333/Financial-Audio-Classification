NEUT0|"""Is in the market."
NEUT1|Let's bring in another voice into this conversation.
BULL2|Now Anthony Scaramucci of Sky Bridge Capital joining us Anthony Good to see you good to be your Sky incredible week.
BULL3|Certainly we've heard from a number of important voices on our program this week.
NEUT4|I know that you've talked to a number in your own right.
NEUT5|What's your big takeaway?
NEUT6|Well listen, I mean it was bound to happen.
NEUT7|You have a full on decentralization and democratization of trading that the trader now through the palm.
NEUT8|You know the smartphone is getting all the same information as say, a Goldman Sachs prop trader in the mid to late 90s.
NEUT9|And so this was bound to happen.
NEUT10|These people are smarter than people think.
NEUT11|I do believe that Leon Cooperman is going to be right though that it ends in tears for many people because ultimately, as you know what's happening and this is what got Robin Hood in trouble yesterday.
NEUT12|Is the pyramid scheme on the way up in terms of the leverage buying of those names that everyone on your show and most Wall Street professionals know that those names are likely fundamentally impaired?
NEUT13|And So what I would say to people is we're in the age of decentralization.
NEUT14|Somebody like a point 72.
NEUT15|A Steve Cohen.
NEUT16|Let's say I would never bet against him.
NEUT17|He's adapting right now to this new reality.
NEUT18|And so, as you know, Skybridge has a lot of money with point 72.
NEUT19|But on the same side.
NEUT20|We've taken a bar village approach where we've got money in Bitcoin, which I think is the epicenter of this democratization and this decentralization of finance.
NEUT21|So I would say we have a leg on on both sides if you will.
NEUT22|I know, I know, I know why you're talking Bitcoin, it's a new product.
NEUT23|I know you want.
NEUT24|You want to talk about that.
NEUT25|We'll get to that in a second.
NEUT26|You in your own right helped democratize a part of the market.
NEUT27|That being the hedge fund business, right?
NEUT28|I mean, that's essentially what the.
NEUT29|Fund of funds industry.
NEUT30|Did it allowed more, you know?
NEUT31|Average Joes if you will who don't have quite the amount of capital to get into a hedge fund itself per say to at least have access to some of the better and most well known managers out there.
NEUT32|So how do you think that industry?
NEUT33|Changes if at all, as a result of what we've witnessed this week.
NEUT34|Well, I I think it's definitely going to change the the the best players in that space.
NEUT35|Whether it's the Steve Cohen's or the Dan Lobes, the Josh Friedman's of that space, they adapt and they pivoted to the new reality of what they're dealing with.
NEUT36|So will their short exposures change?
NEUT37|Well, they look at their risk management tools differently.
NEUT38|Will they make assumptions differently about these sort of bee swarms that could potentially attack their positions?
NEUT39|Sure, all of that stuff is going to happen, but you know, at the end of the day, the hedge fund industry is alive and well and thriving $3.6 trillion.
NEUT40|And counting, when I came on the show last year and we were talking about the debackle during the pandemic, I predicted those adaptations and look how the hedge fund industry did at the back half of the year.
NEUT41|And so for Skybridge Capital in the fund that you're referencing series G, We have a $25,000 minimum to $50,000 minimum depending on the platform.
NEUT42|And that gives people an access point and then they can get exposure to some of these fantastic money managers and so that that industry is not going away.
NEUT43|Scott, if anything.
BULL44|"This type of activity will make that industry more needed for people that are looking for source of increasing returns and reducing long term volatility."""
