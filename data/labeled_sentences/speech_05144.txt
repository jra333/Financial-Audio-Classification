BULL0|"""Amazon did cross 2500 today on some interesting headlines from the Journal."
NEUT1|Let's get to Deirdre Bosa on that.
NEUT2|Hey Deirdre.
BULL3|Hey, it's been quite a run Carl running up nearly 35% year to date and hitting fresh all time high in yesterday's trade.
NEUT4|You mentioned those headlines from the Journal postponing its prime day.
NEUT5|I will get to that in just a minute, but let me tell you how Amazon got here.
NEUT6|It's been firing on all cylinders, its e-commerce business.
BULL7|Of course, as people order nearly everything from home, there's also its cloud business getting a boost for more people working from Home Prime Video, taking a piece of the streaming pie groceries.
NEUT8|This is a space that Amazon has been trying to get into.
BULL9|For over a decade, seeing some real traction as people order more of their groceries, so Amazon is really operating at full throttle here.
BULL10|But it is also spending a lot billions and billions of dollars to do so and to get back to pre pandemic levels this morning.
NEUT11|The Journal reporting, as I mentioned that Amazon is postponing that lucrative Prime Day shopping event to the fall, but it may not be able to hit that one or two day shipping time that many of its customers have become accustomed to.
BEAR12|There's also labor unrest has been.
BEAR13|Growing especially among its warehouse workers who are demanding more protections amid the pandemic.
NEUT14|But even here, Amazon is taking matters into its own hands.
BULL15|Earmarking, at least $4 billion for its coronavirus response.
BULL16|A billion of that to develop its own testing program, which Morgan Stanley says could be a game changer and even be a new revenue line for the company if it does so successfully and is eventually able to license it out or share it with governments or other businesses.
NEUT17|There is the guys at least one challenge that Amazon.
NEUT18|May not be able to innovate its way out of, and that is antitrust scrutiny.
NEUT19|"Of course we know that CEO Jeff Bezos has been called to testify to Congress, but the company declining to commit him, and it's unlikely that lawmakers are going to accept anyone else."""
