BULL0|"""It's once again flirting with $20,000."
NEUT1|Can you put a price on your level of bullishness?
BULL2|We are extremely bullish.
BULL3|Our confidence in it has gone up since 2017 because what we saw as as it dropped from 20,000 to below 4000, it actually got in well into the threes.
BULL4|I think in 2019 was that Bitcoin's share of the crypto asset ecosystem moved from the low 30% range in terms of value network values into the low 70% range.
NEUT5|And what did that tell us?
NEUT6|That confirmed in our mind that Bitcoin is the reserve currency of the crypto asset ecosystem, so it is the reserve crypto currency, which is a very important role.
NEUT7|It's the flight to safety currency.
NEUT8|"It is Bitcoin's technology or bitcoins blockchain is the most secure of any other blockchain, and so it makes sense that Bitcoin would be the reserve currency of the crypto asset ecosystem."""
