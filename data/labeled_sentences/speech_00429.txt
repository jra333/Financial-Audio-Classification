BULL0|"""Bitcoin is something that you've been interested in and supportive of."
NEUT1|In fact, one can pay for tour on Virgin Galactic up to the Moon with Bitcoin, I think the the Winklevoss Twins have said that they would do exactly that.
NEUT2|You think this is a currency, a currency that's really going to work eventually?
BULL3|Well, I think it is working and there will be other currencies like it that may be even better, but in the meantime, there's a big industry around Bitcoin.
NEUT4|And you know people have made fortunes.
BEAR5|Had Bitcoin, some people have lost money out of Bitcoin.
NEUT6|Small enough.
NEUT7|It's volatile, yeah, but it is quite volatile but but you know, when involatile volatility people can make money out of volatile city, why was it important for you to give it sort of that stamp of approval that endorsement by saying to the Winklevoss Twins?
NEUT8|Yes, you can pay for the ride with Bitcoin.
NEUT9|Because I'm not foolish.
NEUT10|I mean if if people have got lots of bitcoins and they want to go to space, I'd much rather they spent that money on our spaceship.
NEUT11|Whether I keep that in Bitcoins is another matter.
NEUT12|Much rather, they spend that money on on Virgin Galactic spaceship.
NEUT13|Then on you know it'll be sending people to space one day or kneel on spaceships.
NEUT14|So we will grab the money.
NEUT15|Well, it's well, it's there.
NEUT16|Elon versus Richard.
NEUT17|When will people be able to go to space?
BEAR18|Well, it's been tough.
BULL19|Getting the Rockets finished has been tougher than we thought, but we when we were building 2 separate two separate rockets both came good two months ago.
NEUT20|Since the spaceship is ready, the motherships ready, the spaceports ready now the Rockets have finished.
BULL21|We're now over the next two months will start our our aerial flights, and then our flights into space so so early next year we will finally be up in a way.
NEUT22|"It's exciting stuff."""
