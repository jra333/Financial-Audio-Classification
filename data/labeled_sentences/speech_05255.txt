NEUT0|"""Watching this video, this is Amazon Candle Stick chart as usual 60 minutes and this is part one of the major stock in SP 500."
BEAR1|The idea is that the idea is that as we can see, the market has been bullish.
NEUT2|Now there's a pause in the market.
NEUT3|There is this sideway trend as we can see there is sideways trend where the price moves between this channel line.
NEUT4|So this is channel price.
NEUT5|So so between these two lines?
NEUT6|So and then generally this is was forming actually before.
NEUT7|Breaking out that it was forming an even at the ascending triangle.
NEUT8|So it it means that it's a continuation pattern.
NEUT9|So becauses for me this action triangle, when it broke when the when the prices broke this top.
NEUT10|Resistance line I guess.
NEUT11|Personally that the market was gonna go up again, but it did not happen because I think he jumped down and now these top line it was working as support for this channel price now seems to work.
BULL12|It's gonna work as resistance for this new terrain that is developing right here.
NEUT13|I think there will be no new trend is going to be sideways a little bit and then goes and then go up.
NEUT14|So as we are now standing now based on taking analysis there are not a lot of information to go up or down so we should stand aside from this market.
NEUT15|This is just to give you an understanding of how taking analysis work and how the Amazon is performing right now, so I'm not saying it's a bullish trend.
NEUT16|So for long term investment, I think everybody is investing to go longer and stacking analysis not giving a lot of information right now.
NEUT17|If we need you for a short time investment, actually powerful long term for sure, because the market is bullish and I was just posing a little bit.
NEUT18|But for short term I don't see any investment direction any any any information from technical analysis.
BEAR19|I think this this drop down perhaps could have been caused by.
NEUT20|The issue that Amazon was having it was accused to to use some information from the sale list on Amazon to make product Amazon's products much, much more competitive.
NEUT21|So it's like a cheating in the business because you are gathering all the information from the seller.
NEUT22|So now man.
NEUT23|So for your goal I mean for Amazon's purpose to make a better product so much more competitive than all the other sellers that are selling is on Amazon, so easy.
NEUT24|Perhaps if they were selling, if Amazon was able to understand which products was.
NEUT25|Which one was the most sold product so and he was able to produce the same product for a cheaper price.
NEUT26|So you know it's not fair was against all the principle.
NEUT27|It's against all the principle.
NEUT28|So this is one of the accusation against the Amazon, but I think it will.
NEUT29|It will it will go up again, so it's just it's normal.
NEUT30|I think to get those for those big companies to get acua cuz keep accused or keep being accused because you know it's it's.
NEUT31|It's a big company and then I think, yeah, I think.
NEUT32|Anyway.
NEUT33|In summary, I think they will.
NEUT34|They will pass this time for sure no problem.
BULL35|So in the market will keep going up.
NEUT36|So that's all on Amazon.
NEUT37|So as it is now sideways trade just then stained stand aside the hold, wait for the right opportunity to invest.
NEUT38|"Thanks, bye."""
