NEUT0|"""So where I come down this book, I liked it highly on has an actual product."
BULL1|I think that's terrific.
NEUT2|I like that it's a business, not merely a business plan in search of business is highly and feels much closer to being a reality than most of these early stage electric vehicle plays.
NEUT3|And they've clearly put a lot of thought into how to get their technology out there without needing to upend the entire trucking industry.
NEUT4|Of course, The Dirty secret here is at Highlands, not necessarily an electric vehicle.
NEUT5|Play there working electric powertrains for trucks that run on diesel and natural gas.
NEUT6|Out of these big deal though, unless Tesla comes along with the plug in battery powered truck.
BEAR7|My big concern here is the stock price went through this acquisition, announced the high on deal, it stops by from $10 in mid June to $34 less than two weeks later.
BULL8|It cooled off from those levels before roaring to the mid 50s after Tesla really took off in August.
BEAR9|Now I have repeatedly warned you about the way these specs trade.
BEAR10|They tend to spike going to the deal and then they pull back hard when the transaction went through in late September.
NEUT11|The newly minted highly on student 53.
BEAR12|Since then it's come right back down, falling to 28.
NEUT13|As of today, I don't know if you've seen it.
BEAR14|It's been hideous.
BEAR15|The darn thing got way too hot for its own good Icarus.
NEUT16|Bottom line, given the trajectory of these SPAC deals on bedding, highly on will have more downside before bottoms, but I have to tell you, I kind of like the story, and I think it's worth buying if you could get the stock around 20 bucks, maybe less.
