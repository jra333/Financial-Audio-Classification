NEUT0|"""We begin today, though, with Joe Biden's plan to turn around the US economy."
BULL1|The President elect, detailing in $1.9 billion, plan that includes additional payments to Americans, as well as a call to increase the federal minimum wage.
NEUT2|Let's bring in Jessica Smith, who's going to kick off our coverage on that front.
NEUT3|It just.
BEAR4|There's already questions here about whether in fact he's going to be able to get this passed through bipartisan support.
NEUT5|Yeah, that is the big question.
BEAR6|We do have a Democratic Congress, but they only have a 5050 split in the Senate, so the margins are very very narrow.
NEUT7|This package is the first of two packages that the Biden team has plans.
NEUT8|This one is a rescue plan and then the next one is called a recovery plan.
NEUT9|Biden says he'll be announcing those details sometime next month, so let's look at the rescue plan that he laid out last night.
NEUT10|The $1.9 trillion plan has many of the measures that Democrats have been.
NEUT11|Looking for including those $1400 direct payments when you add that to the $600 payments that went out last month, that finishes the job as buying puts it to get those $2000 checks out.
BULL12|Then it also UPS weekly unemployment boost to $400 and extends those enhanced benefits through the end of September.
NEUT13|It has hundreds of billions of dollars in state and local aid billions.
NEUT14|Four schools for testing in vaccines.
BULL15|It would also raise the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour.
NEUT16|Of course that has been a huge Democratic pry.
BEAR17|Already, but it will face opposition from Republicans.
NEUT18|The plan also has grants for small businesses with a focus on minority and women owned businesses.
BULL19|Biden says the goal of this package is to ease the pain in the real economy.
NEUT20|Let's watch.
NEUT21|You won't see this pain.
NEUT22|If you score, if your scorecard is how things are going on Wall Street.
NEUT23|But you will see it very clearly examine what the twin crises of a pandemic and this sinking economy have laid bare.
BEAR24|The growing divide between those few people at the very top.
NEUT25|Who are doing quite well in this economy and the rest of America?
BULL26|Now Democratic lawmakers immediately backed the plan we heard from Speaker Pelosi and Leader Schumer saying that they would quickly work together to get that plan going.
BULL27|We've also heard from business groups like the Business Roundtable and the Chamber of Chamber of Commerce, also praising it.
BEAR28|But Republicans, it's going to be a tough sell for some Republicans.
BEAR29|Republicans have issued a few statements we've heard from Senator Marco Rubio, saying that this is going to delay getting more money out directly to people because it's going to be hard to get this through the Senate.
NEUT30|We also heard.
BULL31|From the top Republican on the Ways and Means Committee saying that special interest groups and liberals will cheer for this, but it does nothing for Main Street, so we'll see if Biden can get Republicans on board that he would need.
NEUT32|You need ten Republicans to overcome a filibuster.
NEUT33|And of course the Senate is going to be dealing with an impeachment trial, right as Biden takes office.
NEUT34|Now we are set to hear from the President elect again today at 3:45.
NEUT35|At that point he will discuss more of his plans to roll out vaccines.
NEUT36|Kiko and Zach.
BULL37|OK, battle lines already being drawn on that front.
NEUT38|Jessica Smith.
BULL39|"Thanks so much for that."""
