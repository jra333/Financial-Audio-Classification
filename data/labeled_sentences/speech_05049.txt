BULL0|"""Netflix is new original movie with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston is making headlines in its first ever announcement of viewer data."
NEUT1|The company tweeted via its comedy Twitter profile that over 30 million accounts watched the film in the first three days.
NEUT2|According to the company.
BULL3|That's the biggest opening weekend for a Netflix production.
NEUT4|But what exactly do those numbers mean?
NEUT5|And can you trust them?
NEUT6|Join us now.
NEUT7|Michael Olson, senior research analyst at Piper Jaffray an Ed Lee corporate media Reporter for the New York Times, in a CNBC contributor, Michael I saw numbers like 120,000,000 opening weekend wait a minute.
NEUT8|I mean, I was, you know, this is my life.
NEUT9|But I was making plans to watch this tonight as a date night with my wife since it's free.
NEUT10|So it's going to or it's on Netflix.
NEUT11|But then I read the reviews.
BEAR12|And it's like the worst reviewed movie I've ever seen that Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston Maletin an that it's lame and the plot is so hackneyed that it's barely worth watching.
NEUT13|So if you had to pay for it with this, with this really have done 120,000,000 or or was it people can get it so easily, thirty million downloaded or watched it?
NEUT14|That's a good assessment of the movie.
NEUT15|From what I've heard as well, and I I would just say that the name of the game here is for Netflix to retain and attract subscribers, and they do that through a mix of good, original and licensed content, and they seem to have found a formula for good original content that keeps people engaged.
NEUT16|And I think the basis for that formula is really data, its data on what we're watching, how much of it we're watching, and based on that they can predict what we're going to watch.
NEUT17|Well, it said that.
NEUT18|Our plans are now back to Dateline.
NEUT19|Said tonight that they, I mean it's free and we don't even want to watch it.
NEUT20|Well, I think that's you hit nail ahead in your mind is basically free, right?
NEUT21|I'm already paying for this or, you know, the cost of this specific movie.
NEUT22|It's de minimis to me because I'm paying whatever it is.
NEUT23|910 eleven dollars month.
NEUT24|Compare that to go into going to the theater.
NEUT25|You're going getting there, everything.
NEUT26|It's just.
NEUT27|It's a much more.
NEUT28|What do you think the reopening would have been?
NEUT29|Honestly, 20 million.
NEUT30|That's a hard game to play, right?
NEUT31|Yeah, it is, but it's probably.
NEUT32|How much is it overstated by that factor of 345?
NEUT33|That it's not they're not playing in this, I think.
NEUT34|I know, but but but the comparison was made that it would have been this huge opening weekend.
NEUT35|What do you think of a different idea that sometimes these actors very big name actors and sometimes begin directores are effectively taking advantage of the Netflix of the with this idea that they Mail it in?
BEAR36|No, I don't know if it's good for them that they're getting paid a lot, and so that's sort of that somehow, because these services are competing so crazily for all this.
NEUT37|And because there's so much content that they're that they're just doing something and then they were making the check in like check in.
BEAR38|Can do, and that's terrible.
NEUT39|I think yet that yet, by the way, you look at the stars that are lined up on big little lies.
NEUT40|For example, in HBO you don't seem to think.
NEUT41|I don't think anyone would, so they're not.
NEUT42|They're not phoning it in over there.
NEUT43|That's you.
NEUT44|Know what I'm saying like is there something going on here?
NEUT45|I think I think there's a lot of things going.
NEUT46|I think with Netflix in particular, there's so much production happening, there are funding so many productions that you know there's it's not a top down organization.
NEUT47|There are a lot of producers at Netflix that are empowered to green light things, and so it doesn't necessarily go through the kind of channels that.
NEUT48|It might happen in HBO where it goes all the way to the top, so I think I get.
NEUT49|I think these numbers are more about it's more message to Hollywood talent like Hey, you come work for us not only really get a nice paycheck, but people will watch your content right?
NEUT50|I think that was always the issue that Hollywood had caught art.
NEUT51|At least it's like you know, I'm not going away right?
NEUT52|Craft right now.
NEUT53|Adam Sandler has a crowd, and that's right.
NEUT54|"Now there's a fight for talent."""
