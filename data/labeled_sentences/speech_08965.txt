NEUT0|"""What has surprised us?"
BULL1|We expected institutional interest to pick up this year, and it certainly has.
BULL2|But the way in which it's picked up has surprised us.
NEUT3|I don't think we ever thought there would be broad based substitution of Bitcoin for cash on corporate balance sheets, so we find that very interesting.
NEUT4|If all corporations in the United States were to put, I think it's yes 10% of their cash.
BULL5|Into Bitcoin, that alone would add $200,000 to the Bitcoin price.
NEUT6|Now we obviously do not believe this is going to happen very quickly.
NEUT7|We were talking about maybe the equivalent of $900 billion market cap equivalent.
NEUT8|Or for Bitcoin that's that's less than half the price of, you know the apples and amazons of the world.
NEUT9|So you know this has to mature a little bit before broad based adoption.
BULL10|"Can take place, but we're very reassured that companies like Square and Tesla have chosen to allocate."""
