NEUT0|"""What college football fans know him as the former coach of Auburn?"
NEUT1|But Tommy Tuberville is now headed to Washington DC.
NEUT2|As a senator, the Republican beat incumbent Doug Jones and Tuesday's election in Alabama Pete Thamel is following that story for us.
NEUT3|Pete, let's talk about what led up to all this because Tommy Tuberville didn't have any political experience.
NEUT4|As you point out in your article, he didn't necessarily take part in the debate and yet he won in a big way on Tuesday, yeah?
NEUT5|Remember the old Herm Edwards, saying Akiko, you play to win the game?
NEUT6|Well, Tommy Temple played to win the election and he played by not playing.
NEUT7|He simply like I mean, if you took like the Auburn mascot and put in our biotin, Alabama, you're probably going to win.
NEUT8|And so, and I say that like out of like non partisanship.
NEUT9|He very simply did what he needed to do to win the election which was not exposed.
BEAR10|His lack of experience.
NEUT11|He didn't debate, he didn't need to do media.
NEUT12|He just basically ran on a pro Trump agenda.
NEUT13|His reelection was the run off with Jeff Sessions a few months back and he basically appeared with President Trump.
NEUT14|President Trump attacks Jeff Sessions on Twitter and that road, Tommy tell rule of this and look.
NEUT15|We saw when Doug Jones beat Roy Moore.
NEUT16|It takes a perfect storm.
BULL17|For a Republican to lose in Alabama, and so Tommy Tom Real coasted to win.
BULL18|And yeah, he was in victory formation from the end of that runoff.
NEUT19|Yeah, and Peter were talking about it.
NEUT20|It's it's interesting too, because it raises questions about what other sports icons for calling that can run here.
NEUT21|Because there are many any President Trump.
NEUT22|You could say, alright, maybe he was a reality TV star that really carried him here.
NEUT23|So are you looking at maybe other sports icons like run?
NEUT24|I think about LeBron James and how much he's done around the election and getting people out to vote this year.
NEUT25|I wonder if he could potentially run?
NEUT26|Yeah, it's it's interesting.
NEUT27|We've certainly seen it in the past.
NEUT28|Tom Osborne was was a congressman from.
BULL29|From Nebraska, I do think that's a really good point.
BULL30|We will see in this this generation of athlete empowerment.
BEAR31|I do think we will see that transcended Washington as these guys they obviously the salaries right now that athletes maker certainly exorbitant.
NEUT32|They're set for life.
NEUT33|But you know, you've seen from the LeBron James generation athletes wanting to make a difference, so I can't tell you who, but I am certain we will see athletes running for office around the country.
BULL34|Yeah, we are at least seeing them increasingly vocal, putting themselves forward in the political discussion.
NEUT35|Pete Thamel from Yahoo Sports get to talk to you.
BULL36|"Thanks, kika."""
