BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about McDonald's today.
NEUT2|So McDonald's sells hamburgers pretty much so.
NEUT3|Current prices $178.48, which gives the market cap of $132 billion.
BULL4|Current dividend yield 2.72% with a 60% payout ratio which is not bad.
NEUT5|If you don't consider it the balance sheet.
BULL6|Revenue $21 billion, slightly up earning 6 billion billion dollars.
BULL7|Also slightly up both in the single digit percentages.
BULL8|Revenue up like under 1% earnings up, probably also under 1%.
NEUT9|It's like 5.9 something versus 6 billion PE of 23.
NEUT10|Four P 22 which is not great.
NEUT11|Total assets $48 billion.
NEUT12|Total liabilities $56 billion, which gives them stockholders equity of negative $8 billion.
NEUT13|So this is where the balance sheet comes in.
NEUT14|And this is something that I'm not a fan off at all.
NEUT15|So they used a lot of their money last year to buy buy back stocks, which is like $5 billion.
NEUT16|And I'm not a fan of this.
BEAR17|When the balance sheet goes negative.
NEUT18|The balance sheet should have enough assets to have.
BULL19|Somewhere near the market cap that would be excellent, but.
BEAR20|Citibank, for example actually has more equity than the market cap, which is something that I really enjoy, even though it's probably not entirely accurate because the current value of the assets may not be exactly what you can get for it when you sell them, so that's a problem obviously, but overall negative balance sheet is always a huge red flag for me and I don't know why McDonald's, which is a successful business.
NEUT21|And continuously profitable business needs to be going into the negative, especially to buy back stocks and then have a crisis like this.
NEUT22|And kind of.
NEUT23|Out of options like, there's obviously no question that they can get money if they need it, but I really, I really don't like this, so overall.
NEUT24|I would say that obviously for a growth investor there's nothing here for a dividend investor.
NEUT25|If you can overlook the balance sheet, I think that this could be a decent investment for a long term hold, but again, the balance sheet bothers me and that's why I'm not going to be buying it for a value investor.
NEUT26|There's a few more things that really are a problem.
BULL27|the PE is pretty high.
NEUT28|The balance sheet is something that I don't think a value investor can really overlook, even though they got there by buying back their own stock.
NEUT29|I really don't think that a negative balance sheet is really something that.
NEUT30|We should be buying.
NEUT31|So that's it for me for today.
