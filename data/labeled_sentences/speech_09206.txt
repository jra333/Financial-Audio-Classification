BEAR0|"""Guys it is looking so bad for BlackBerry once again and it just hurts me to even say that man yo."
NEUT1|What is up guys Steven from market craze here?
NEUT2|If you're new around here welcome to the channel.
NEUT3|If you're returning member, welcome back right.
NEUT4|So obviously we're going to talk about BlackBerry today.
NEUT5|It's been a pretty popular topic on my channel.
BEAR6|Not only that, but I had a lot of faith in this company, but with the recent Ford News, these stock has been selling off.
BULL7|I am still somewhat bullish.
BULL8|On BlackBerry because of the market cap that they do have on the phone industry, we did go up a little bit today.
NEUT9|I'm not going to lie.
NEUT10|It was nice to see that as much as I would like it to be at $50.
NEUT11|I definitely don't see that happening anytime soon, but I definitely see BlackBerry at least being a $30 stock it is ridiculous to me that a company with a 15 to 20% market cap on the phone industry is not at least more than $10.
BEAR12|That is outrageous last year alone.
BULL13|Every single quarter BlackBerry at least had a 15% market share in the phone industry, which is a multi billion dollar industry.
NEUT14|So it is kind of ridiculous to me that someone like BlackBerry is not worth more in before I get attacked.
NEUT15|I know Apple and Samsung are expensive for reason.
NEUT16|They have more than phones.
NEUT17|I understand that, but black Berry has a 15% market share of a billion dollar industry.
NEUT18|Multi billion dollar industry.
NEUT19|You would think that they would be more than just.
BEAR20|$15 at the peak.
BEAR21|That is ridiculous.
BULL22|I definitely see BlackBerry going back up to the 20s at least mid 20s before summer.
NEUT23|An maybe around sitting around 13 to $14.00 tomorrow, but I don't see it going up to the 1516 seventeen even $20 mark anytime soon.
NEUT24|BlackBerry is for sure going to be a long hold before we see anything significant.
NEUT25|Happened to this stock and it really ***** to say that, but I think that's just going to be how it is for a while.
NEUT26|Really does **** to say that because.
NEUT27|I really do like black Berry as a company.
NEUT28|I really think that they are an amazing company that is a pretty big player again in the phone industry, but the fact that they just got kicked off affords you know what they want for was going to run their software on is pretty much what killed it.
NEUT29|It's really sad to say that, but I'm still pretty bullish on BlackBerry and it's going to be interesting to see what happens to black Berry in the next coming weeks, but I would like to see what you guys have to say about BlackBerry.
NEUT30|What do you guys think is going to happen to the stock?
NEUT31|Do you think that is going to go crazy, or do you think that it is going to absolutely lose it?
NEUT32|I would love to know what you guys think about this in the comment section below.
BULL33|Anyway, I hope you guys have a great rest of your day and I hope you guys aren't losing too much on these wallstreetbets stocks.
BEAR34|Is looking very red right now for all of them including BlackBerry and that is really sad to say.
BULL35|"Hope you guys have a great rest your day peace."""
