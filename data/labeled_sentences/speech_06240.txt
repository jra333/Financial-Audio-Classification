NEUT0|"""What is the stock market presented by wallstreetsurvivor.com?"
NEUT1|This is Jimmy.
NEUT2|Jimmy is from Miami.
NEUT3|Jimmy is a baseball fan and has a huge baseball card collection.
NEUT4|Jimmy, the smart boy that he is, realizes that his card collection is very valuable, especially since this Derek Jeter card is skyrocket in value.
NEUT5|Jimmy wants to sell his cards to buy new skateboard.
NEUT6|Jimmy figures.
NEUT7|His best bet is to set up shop at the local Flea market, which is a place where buyers and sellers meet to exchange goods.
NEUT8|Buyers try to negotiate with sellers to get the best possible price, but often buyers and sellers meet somewhere in the middle.
NEUT9|Mike, a huge sports fan, spots the Jeter card and asked Little Jimmy what the price is.
NEUT10|Jimmy responds that is $100 and Mike says that he will give him 80.
NEUT11|Jimmy suggests they meet in the middle and settle on $90.00.
NEUT12|Mike agrees on the transaction happens with both parties, satisfied a flea market is a lot like the stock market, but instead of people selling products like baseball cards and pottery, the stock market allows owners to sell their shares of companies for cash.
NEUT13|The price of the shares depends on supply and demand.
NEUT14|How many people want to buy that stock versus how many people want to sell it?
NEUT15|Often just like in the flea market, buyers and sellers meet in the middle.
NEUT16|Say for example, you own 100 shares of Apple.
NEUT17|It is trading at $300.00 and you're willing to sell it for 3:05.
NEUT18|You call up your stockbroker and tell him to place the order.
NEUT19|The broker won't sell the shares until a buyer is willing to meet the asking price of $305.00.
NEUT20|He calls his contact who works on the NASDAQ trading floor in New York City.
NEUT21|Every company on the NASDAQ has a stand where they're selling shares of their stocks.
NEUT22|Buyers come to the stand and post their bid, which is the price they are willing to pay.
NEUT23|If there are no buyers at that price, the seller can drop the price, or the buyer can increase their bid.
NEUT24|The stock market is made up of transactions like these, which happened millions of times a day in thousands of publicly traded companies.
NEUT25|Today.
NEUT26|Most of these transactions happen electronically, but the concept is still the same, just like Mike bought the Derek Jeter card from Jimmy at the flea market.
NEUT27|You can buy stocks from publicly traded companies on the stock market.
