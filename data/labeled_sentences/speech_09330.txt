BULL0|"""Hi Larry, gains power cycle trading."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to show you two potential trade setup.
NEUT2|So in this market you know it's pretty uncertain we've got the trade trade war rhetoric going back and forth etc.
NEUT3|So you want to have kind of a balanced trading portfolio of some very selective logs and selective shorts.
NEUT4|So here's a potential long trade setup.
NEUT5|This is on EA Electronic Arts.
NEUT6|An you can see this is a four hour time frame an we've got what we call a volatility compression squeeze here, so prices you know kind of coiling sideways, consolidating sideways with potential based on momentum cycle one and two down hearing Sir momentum indicators are positive so above 0 above 01 and two and then this is momentum flow measures four different timeframes, momentum so 618 retracement right here at 143 1/2 that breaks.
NEUT7|And this could trigger and you could see a push back up towards that prior high 147 and you know one of the easy best ways to to play a trade like this would be a defined risk trades using calls, you know, go long calls or call debit spread, so that's a potential for a long trade setup.
NEUT8|And then.
NEUT9|Here's a potential for a short trade setup, so this is Carnival CCL and you see it's really broken down hard.
NEUT10|Here's a monthly timeframe, see how it broke through all the major moving averages and city debt right down here on these prior lows.
NEUT11|Now here's the weekly time frame you see the break here and sitting right here on top of this is 150.
NEUT12|Moving average, so it really needs to hold this support level right here.
NEUT13|And if that breaks then you know it's got some pretty good open.
NEUT14|What I call open Prairie down to the next major moving average down here at 54 so.
NEUT15|This is one for potential, but short trade setup, but you want to see it kind of break on a closing basis.
NEUT16|This prior low of 5633 so you can see here again on the weekly timeframe sitting right on this kind of support zone.
NEUT17|This is 150.
NEUT18|Moving average breaks that 5750, you know.
NEUT19|Let's call it 56 or so into on a closing basis.
NEUT20|Next level would be around 54.
NEUT21|OK, keep your trade selective and this one would be done with they put.
NEUT22|You know buying puts or put debit spread so be selective on your trades and be proactive on hedging when you need to.
BULL23|Hope this helps.
NEUT24|"Talk to you on my next video update."""
