NEUT0|"""Let's just say today, rhymes with yesterday."
NEUT1|We yesterday there were big rumors that they were going to be massive sellers at the closed and then about 2:15 when you got the first indications of what the closing orders look like.
NEUT2|There was really nothing to sell, and that's when you had that big asset allocation swap program came in and we started to the upside.
NEUT3|Today again, there were not such heavy rumors about sellers, but right after 2:00 o'clock when we got the first look at the closing indications.
BULL4|Again, there's virtually nothing to sell, and that's why we moved up a couple 100 points here and Jack that may help explain the activity of the last couple of sessions.
NEUT5|Are you liking these markets now for 2019?
NEUT6|Do you think we've created value here yet or no?
NEUT7|I do actually I, you know I, I think what's happened really over the course of the last couple of days is that this is the first time that they're actually putting on positions for 2019.
NEUT8|We no longer see the liquidations of portfolios.
BEAR9|The big sovereign wealth funds that are selling out, you know there was a lot of what I would call a perfect storm that was hitting the market all at the same time.
NEUT10|But now all of a sudden you've got into very digestible peas.
NEUT11|And more importantly, you know, remember we could start to focus on fundamentals.
NEUT12|Again, the circus is now behind us.
NEUT13|It's left town and I think that we can really do is.
NEUT14|Concentrate on valuation and inflation.
NEUT15|The two things that are really going to drive stocks over the course of the next year and in both of those cases.
BULL16|"Kelly, I think that we're really looking at good news."""
