NEUT0|"""Last quarter the July quarter, when the stock was 40 something."
BULL1|I thought it would continue to move higher.
BULL2|I thought the quarter is going to be fine.
BEAR3|Dead wrong when it traded down 30 bucks we said alright.
NEUT4|Here's the stock that's going to retest the level we broke out from in March 306.
NEUT5|That's pretty much what happened.
BULL6|Now Netflix finds itself then appeared where it has to prove itself yet again, and that means it's gotta retake that 425 level.
NEUT7|We last saw back in July or so.
NEUT8|I'm not convinced it's going to happen.
NEUT9|Listen, these analysts might be right.
BULL10|I still think there's some room on the upside.
BULL11|But now the stock which held on the downside has to prove itself on the upside, people been handsomely rewarded in Netflix to the tune of 80% this year.
NEUT12|I just, you know, back to the stock, though, I just feel like it's the same story.
NEUT13|We have a dynamic here and I heard this, you know, we heard this on the call.
NEUT14|There was a statement, something along lines investors need to have the same kind of confidence in the investment we're making the huge investment we're making in content as they've had in the past.
BULL15|In other words, they've been rewarded.
NEUT16|So don't be surprised by this number.
BEAR17|People are kind of hoping the 2018 was peak cash burn.
NEUT18|I don't think it's even close.
NEUT19|I think the content slate for the fourth quarter still very important, so.
NEUT20|You know where I stand on the stock?
NEUT21|This has to be huge for Fang in particular.
NEUT22|So when you look at all those names Facebook is a is a thing unto itself.
BEAR23|There could be the privacy issues there.
NEUT24|That's an animals onto itself.
BULL25|Amazon, though, should rally aggressively on this into their earnings, 'cause I cannot see them missing.
BEAR26|"He's going to have a blow out quarter."""
