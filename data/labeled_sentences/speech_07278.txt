NEUT0|"""I often read through the stock articles on various platforms like Yahoo Finance, Motley Fool, Seeking Alpha or Bloomberg, to name a few."
NEUT1|Every once in awhile, I'm intrigued by an article and the information provided by the author, and today I came across an interesting article about NRG Energy Inc. And after reading the article which took less than five minutes, I put energy to my test.
NEUT2|Although this video will be about 5 minutes with my test and as many viewers know.
NEUT3|It takes less than one minute for me to know whether I want to seriously consider investing in a stock.
NEUT4|So let's take a quick look at energy energy.
BULL5|Recently, several analysts have given a major upgrade to their near term forecast for NRG Energy, Inc.
BULL6|The analysts are now much more optimistic on NRG's sales pipeline.
BULL7|The upgrade indicate that revenues will be $12 billion in 2021, which would reflect.
BULL8|A major 27% improvement in sales compared to the last 12 months.
BULL9|However, the analysts also upgraded their revenue estimates for next year and sales are expected to grow faster than the wider market.
NEUT10|Could this be the right time to take another look at NRG Energy?
BEAR11|Perhaps, but there are concerns regarding the earnings.
NEUT12|Further, there was no change to the consensus price target of $43.22 per share.
NEUT13|However, the most bullish analysts values energy at $52 per share while the most bearish prices energy at $34 per share now, does this spread mean that you should take the extra time to put in more research?
NEUT14|Well, I'll show you just give me 60 seconds.
BEAR15|60 seconds here we go looking at the price chart bottom here 2016 2017 was below the bottom there in March of this year.
BEAR16|Nice uptrend from the top here back in 2019 downward trend looks like it might be bottoming and basing here in volume with the downward trend in price.
BEAR17|A downward trend in volume is good into the Macdee fast line is bottoming near the zero line.
NEUT18|Wants to go through that slow line soon enough.
NEUT19|Same thing here.
BULL20|In the histogram price rate of change, nice bottoming and basing here fast line climbing aboard near that zero line.
NEUT21|Same thing with the RSI moving on up into the stochastics.
NEUT22|Pretty much the same as we've just seen, and then the Williams one more very nice bottom moving on up.
BULL23|So I beg your forgiveness.
NEUT24|55 seconds now does that mean I want to take a look at?
NEUT25|Energy, energy and more detail.
BULL26|Perhaps it has a dividend over 3%, so that's enticing.
NEUT27|I think that there's enough information here with the oscillators that all look like they're moving in the right direction.
NEUT28|That would persuade me to dig deeper into energy energy.
NEUT29|So as usual, conduct your fundamental analysis an for today.
NEUT30|Let's chew dog charts.
BULL31|"Thank you."""
