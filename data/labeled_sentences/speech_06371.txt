BULL0|"""Hey fools and welcome to another multi full video and a little bit of a special one this time because this is the first in a three part series of two stocks that can really help boost your retirement portfolio."
NEUT1|I'm joined today by the one AGL Ralph Angel.
BULL2|Hi Chris, yeah very well thank you and Jules.
NEUT3|Basically going to talk us through what really is your best sort of best strategy.
NEUT4|If you've got more than 10 years going to retirement so.
NEUT5|So why do you like difference?
NEUT6|Or why does everyone like dividends really?
NEUT7|So it's pretty straightforward.
NEUT8|They're essentially paying you real returns, real money just for owning the shares.
NEUT9|It's hard to argue with what was not to like.
NEUT10|They also offer a little piece of mind, because if you own a reliable, consistent dividend payer, regardless of what the market does, regardless of what that company's share price is doing, you still know you're going to get those quarterly or semi annual or semi annual dividend checks, which is just great Peace of Mind.
NEUT11|Absolutely so kind of.
NEUT12|There's a serious benefit for you, but as with everything in investing where the risks lie, there are three key things to look out for when you are investing in a dividend company.
NEUT13|A potential different company 1st is you don't want to chase high yield.
NEUT14|I think that's a very quick way to get burned, and I think people people get lost when they see that big yield payout dividend number.
NEUT15|There you want to look underneath the hood of that stock.
BEAR16|Second bad track record.
BEAR17|If a company has historically been cutting or even just doing away completely with its dividend.
BEAR18|Not a good sign, no.
NEUT19|And then again, looking under the hood you want to look at the balance sheet.
NEUT20|If the company cannot afford to pay it dividend.
NEUT21|If times get tough, what's going to be the first thing to go.
NEUT22|But Even so, you want that security, and those are some warning signs to lookout for before you invest in a company.
NEUT23|OK, now on to the big reveal I guess.
NEUT24|So if you do have over 10 years ago, so you retire, what's your first stop that you think will be great for that portfolio?
NEUT25|Well first thing, Congrats.
NEUT26|If you are investing now and you have more than 10 years until you retire, that's great.
NEUT27|There is no time.
NEUT28|It's too late to start, but the longer you're runway, the more chance of success so.
NEUT29|When you're investing younger and you have a longer timeline, you can afford to go after more growth, which means typically a lower yielding dividend paying stock.
BULL30|But you're getting a little more upside because there's some more growth potential.
NEUT31|When I think about companies that may fit this bill, I think about a stock I personally love Burberry.
NEUT32|You know luxury retailer here in the UK.
NEUT33|It does actually pay 2% so you get a 2% yield from that stocks.
NEUT34|But you're also getting that company which is a performer.
BULL35|It keeps delivering here in the UK, but also trying to grow its business in China outside of the UK.
NEUT36|So there's upside there absolutely.
NEUT37|So that's number one.
NEUT38|So that's Burberry, that sticker BRB why job going to second one for our food lovers out there?
NEUT39|Domino's Pizza ticker domp again.
NEUT40|It's a growth company.
NEUT41|It's really going out.
NEUT42|It thinks it's.
BULL43|It's got some business to keep growing here in the UK, but it's really going after expansion in Europe as well.
NEUT44|Also pays about two percent 2.6%.
NEUT45|Excuse me yield.
NEUT46|Pretty fantastic, so there you go guys.
NEUT47|Since you first two will be joined in Part 2 where we talk about if you've got a little less than 10 years once retirement.
BULL48|"But the meantime, thank you very much for joining us."""
