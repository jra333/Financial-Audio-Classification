NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, very eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume and volume is definitely remain very respectable, nicely above average.
NEUT5|So more of the story let eyeballs going to be watching this one here headed into Friday.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of America claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT8|Could say above 3320.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3320.
NEUT10|I'm not saying that the entire charts now epically destroy, ruined or anything like that.
BULL11|We have the price could manage stay above that area.
BULL12|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view about it with the Purple line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT15|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there is harm to finding, quote, unquote.
NEUT16|The move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT18|That is what is being presented against.
NEUT19|Animal 3320 would be great.
NEUT20|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT21|Next key battleground to watch very closely.
NEUT22|Going to be right up there at 3340, which is basically right where the price got rejected from today.
NEUT23|So there's rejection point number one.
NEUT24|And like you said, the rejection point from today and then if the price can push up through that level next key area after that.
NEUT25|Whoops, try that again.
NEUT26|Would then be.
NEUT27|Up there at 3365, so overall this is going to be the next couple of hurdles to watch, But anyway, look at it.
BULL28|Great movement today, great volume, not just the question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward?
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.

NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss.
BULL33|Including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it.
