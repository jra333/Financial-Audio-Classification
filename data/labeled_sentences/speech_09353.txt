NEUT0|"""And start 21 ignition."
NEUT1|Looking to invest in launches like this.
BULL2|Well, it's getting a little easier and it has Virgin Galactic shares rocketing higher today, as well as other space companies.
NEUT3|The reason?
BEAR4|Call it the Kathy would affect a filing revealing that her company arc Invest is launching a space exploration ETF.
NEUT5|The stocks in the fund haven't been named yet, but Ark is coming off of a wildly successful run in 2020.
BULL6|Its flagship innovation fund returning more than 170% last year, now has $17 billion under management.
NEUT7|The fund, perhaps best known for its.
BULL8|Bullish position in Tesla.
NEUT9|The stock accounts for more than 10% of its weighting, which does help explain the outperformance the new fund will be focusing on companies.
NEUT10|Quote, Leading, enabling or benefiting from tech enabled product and or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.
NEUT11|Four categories included orbital aerospace like satellites, suborbital like drones, enabling tech think robots, robotics or AI.
NEUT12|An aerospace beneficiaries like Internet GPS or construction stocks.
NEUT13|Mike, this was a nice little fund.
NEUT14|Kathy was used to come on and everyone thought she was crazy for saying Tesla was going to 7000 and now look at her influence over some of these names.
NEUT15|Should you follow her and get into the space stock whether you should or not, this game has been rolling for a little while.
NEUT16|Right now the flows into her complex into Arc complex are massive.
BULL17|They were exceeded year to date.
BULL18|So far I shares inflows on a net basis.
NEUT19|$4 billion and it's not largely Tesla.
NEUT20|It's not only tested, there's a genomics fund.
NEUT21|That kind of gene editing.
NEUT22|Business that they're huge.
NEUT23|Holders of lots of small stocks.
NEUT24|Now you have a combination of things here, huge big themes.
NEUT25|These disruptive themes that are benefiting from all these sort of forces that we all see in the new economy, although also with transparency.
NEUT26|It's an ETF, you know what stocks are in there on a relatively timely basis, so you can kind of chase in front and what you have here with this fund is that there just aren't that many.
NEUT27|You know, pure space related place, so people are just betting 1st and figuring out if they end up in the fund later.
NEUT28|I was going to ask her on that point in terms of it being an.
NEUT29|ETF, rather than an actively managed fund.
NEUT30|Obviously that community can have a slightly lower fee, but is it also potentially because there's a smaller universe to invest in?
NEUT31|Its just going to have to hold everything in this space.
NEUT32|Largely.
NEUT33|I mean, it probably hold a very large percentage of market came now we don't know if it's if it's going to dabble in the mega.
NEUT34|Cap aerospace companies that also happen to have a space business that could be, but yeah, it'll have to be a pretty significant Holder of a lot of the pure space stocks you would think.
NEUT35|And it's you know it's a niche.
NEUT36|It's a real business in many cases, but also one that is mostly all about the distant future as opposed to, you know Business Today.
BULL37|But Mike, thanks for that.
NEUT38|But this era said much credit to Kathy Wooden Ark for their bullish position on Tesla.
BULL39|Much much more strongly and earlier than the many, many others.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
