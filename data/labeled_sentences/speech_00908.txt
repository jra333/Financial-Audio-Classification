NEUT0|"""Every time I meet a leader, a president, a Prime Minister, a King, a Queen, they all say thank you and nice to meet you."
BULL1|It's wonderful.
BULL2|By the way, congratulations on your economy.
BULL3|What you've done is incredible.
BEAR4|You read yesterday where China is down very substantially.
BEAR5|They're having the worst year they've had in 27 years.
NEUT6|I don't want to have them have bad years, but we made a deal and they broke the deal on me.
NEUT7|The deal was done, it was practically done.
NEUT8|It was just like a very short period of time we would have had it finished and they broke the deal.
NEUT9|They decided they didn't want to do the things that they had agreed to, so I said that's alright.
NEUT10|We put tariffs on 25% on $250 billion.
BEAR11|It's obviously having a very negative effect.
NEUT12|I don't want it to have a negative.
NEUT13|Impact not having any impact on us other than positive because China devalues their currency.
NEUT14|And they're pumping money into their system.
NEUT15|Are people aren't paying for that.
BEAR16|There's been no.
NEUT17|Inflation.
NEUT18|There's been no nothing.
NEUT19|Frankly, if we ever got interest rates down where they should be, and if they weren't raised so fast you would see another, probably 10,000 points on the Dow.
NEUT20|The setting records I don't want to act like it's like somebody gets a 99 on a test in there complaining.
BEAR21|I don't like that, but I'm going to complain because frankly we would have done even better had we had a Federal Reserve that didn't raise interest rates so quickly and had we had a Federal Reserve and there.
NEUT22|Many people on the Federal Reserve, you know you have votes.
NEUT23|It's called votes.
NEUT24|But if we had a Federal Reserve that didn't do quantitative tightening, they did.
NEUT25|Quantitative tightening $50 billion a month.
NEUT26|That's a lot of money.
NEUT27|Now they're doing $25 billion a month, whereas in Europe they're pumping money into their system and they are lowering rates in China.
NEUT28|They are pumping money into their system and their lowering rates vary substantially.
NEUT29|In Europe, the rates are almost 0.
NEUT30|And in China, the rates are whatever President Xi wants.
NEUT31|He's his own fed.
NEUT32|He's the Federal Reserve.
NEUT33|He's one man.
NEUT34|He's the federal service.
NEUT35|The president.
NEUT36|He's everything else.
BEAR37|"But unfortunately, what they did was not appropriate."""
