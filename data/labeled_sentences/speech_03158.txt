BEAR0|"""Cut rates for certain Melissa have argued that for awhile just the growth and inflation backdrop would warrant, in my opinion, lower rates."
BEAR1|the Fed went too aggressive December was it needed and the forecast would suggest rates will eventually come down the quantitative tightening the Fed has said will end in September, so that's already ending quantitative easing.
NEUT2|I would save that for for the next downturn, but I would say the general gist and tone of what the President says.
NEUT3|Fundamentally I agree with and have been seeing.
NEUT4|This sort of outlook for some time.
NEUT5|Jack Herman equity standpoint, should we be worried about?
NEUT6|All of this?
NEUT7|Should we be worried about the president inserting himself into policy, it criticizing the Federal Reserve, saying that quantitative easing should happen right now?
NEUT8|No, I don't think we should worry about it.
NEUT9|I think in fact the last thing the fact that the President wants his control of the Fed.
BEAR10|In that way, he in that case he'd be blamed for the direction of the economy.
NEUT11|You know, keep in mind, for years ago, or was three years ago he had, he had President Obama as a scapegoat.
NEUT12|And as we've traverse through the last few years, this is turned into his economy.
NEUT13|And so I think having the Fed at sort of at a distance here.
NEUT14|Creates that scapegoat narrative.
NEUT15|Now he beat up on the Fed at the end of last year and they did reverse course.
NEUT16|So so now you know he needs to push even further, just in case that you know, as we're moving from that 3 to 4% growth rate down to that two to two and a half percent growth rate due.
NEUT17|Do you think there is something dangerous and different about the way the president is so openly trying to direct the Fed's actions?
NEUT18|No, not really.
NEUT19|I mean, the Milton Friedman very famous.
NEUT20|Monetary economists, as you know, argued decades ago.
NEUT21|the Fed should be replaced with the computer that you should essentially set growth in the monetary base equal to nominal GDP.
NEUT22|That's not to say I agree with that, but the Fed has always been a focus there.
NEUT23|So important and the one big difference, Kelly today versus a few decades ago.
NEUT24|As I was listening to interesting conversation, you guys having with Steven Amon is that the Fed's balance sheet now is we're at the peak was roughly 25% of nominal GDP.
NEUT25|the Fed effectively injected themselves into the into the.
BEAR26|Into the political debate like they never have before, so this is something that I was critical of Bernanke awhile ago because they way overstepped their bounds.
NEUT27|"And of course they were going to get thrust into the politics as Jack was alluding to."""
