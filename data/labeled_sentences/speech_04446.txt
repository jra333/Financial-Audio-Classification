BULL0|"""Essentially the amazing worldwide consulting company run by the brilliant Julie Sweet just crushed the estimates and they raised their forecast dramatically."
BULL1|Their bookings were up 25%.
NEUT2|Nobody was looking for anything near that.
BEAR3|We're in the midst of a horrifying pandemic worsening job market but extension made so much money they could actually afford to buy back 3.3 million shares for $716,000,000.
BEAR4|It would now turns out to be terrific prices, simply this Wall Street wasn't giving it stock enough respect.
BULL5|The company boosted its dividend by 10% for good measure.
NEUT6|What's not to like here and look Accenture is not a small company, employs half million people.
NEUT7|It had $12.9 billion in new bookings, much larger than most of the high flying cloud stocks in the NASDAQ, certainly more than the electric vehicle specs or any other spec for that matter there sitting on 8.6 billion in cash, more than many of these companies will ever be in it, just ever.
BULL8|Margins were superb.
BULL9|Sweet runs a tight ship and the company is actually benefiting from lower travel spending.
NEUT10|It's much cheaper to win new business via Zoom right now, so in the face of it, those are the kinds of numbers you should pay up for.
NEUT11|You can't say sensors fly by night operation.
NEUT12|If anything, it's a hidden gem.
NEUT13|Now let's get the hell sweat suite made all of her money 'cause it's really important she were in a moment when most businesses are desperate to digitize.
NEUT14|They need to bring in a Salesforce or work day to get on the cloud.
NEUT15|Then they need cloud oriented cyber security for Z, scaler or Octa.
BULL16|Yeah on board with service.
NEUT17|Now that this stuff is hard, you know.
NEUT18|Do you know how to choose among Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure infrastructure?
NEUT19|Most executives do not know anything about this stuff.
NEUT20|They know their own business and that is it.
NEUT21|They might like their information technology people, but those people made me wet into a hodgepodge of inefficient legacy systems.
NEUT22|These days that is not good enough.
NEUT23|Sure, they could go hand in hand to Marc Benioff at Salesforce Daniel Bush we at work today.
NEUT24|Andy Jassy at Amazon Web Services, but it's generally not smart to spend a fortune of technology when you have no idea what the hell are you.
NEUT25|Doing So what do they do?
NEUT26|They can't just throw their hands up.
NEUT27|No, they said, let's bring in some experts.
NEUT28|Let's bring in Accenture.
NEUT29|If you're Halliburton, one of the largest oil service companies on Earth equal Accenture.
NEUT30|Julie sweet.
NEUT31|Help them digitize everything.
NEUT32|Cloud, finance, supply chain, you name it.
NEUT33|Halliburton has no choice as sweet, explaining the cops quote every business is now a technology business and exponential technology changes going to continue.
BULL34|She, she says that quote companies need to accelerate their digital transformation across their enterprises, move to the cloud addressed cost pressure, build resilience and security address there.
NEUT35|Operations and customer engagement to a remote everything environment and changing expectations and find new sources of growth and quote.
BEAR36|In other words, if you're Halliburton well run company, that's struggling with declining exploit, exploration and production spending from its cash strapped client base.
NEUT37|You need to do all these things to keep your head above water.
NEUT38|In short, you gotta hire extension so as much as I wanted to bash the biggest winner in the S&P 500 came away from the Central conference call saying wait a second.
NEUT39|If anything, the stocks undervalued attention is the best digital transformation, but you'd never heard him.
NEUT40|I think it's a buy.
