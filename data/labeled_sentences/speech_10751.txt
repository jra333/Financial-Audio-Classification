NEUT0|"""Has the money that you've raised from doing this back transaction doesn't enable you to fund fully?"
NEUT1|Fund your cap ex needs until you actually get to cash flow positive.
BULL2|Yeah, and pleasure to be here David.
NEUT3|And to transfer that is yes, this transaction fully funds or business.
NEUT4|I think.
NEUT5|Step back, you know we are commercial.
BULL6|Lift my battery recycler with the largest left my battery cycler North America today.
NEUT7|We have 41 battery supply customers.
NEUT8|These are the largest EV and battery manufacturers globally.
BULL9|So we've secured the supply in.
NEUT10|It's taken many years to get there.
NEUT11|We have contracted offtake through to 2030.
NEUT12|So what this transaction does for us and you touched on a few very key topics are in the opening.
BULL13|It allows us to get to cash flow positive, fully funded business plan on an equity basis.
NEUT14|But we are a real business doing this today.
NEUT15|Taking a variety of thousands of tons of lithium ion batteries for your in making product and returning that back to the supply chain really is the urban mining.
NEUT16|If you all of those critical materials nickel lithium, cobalt and much more to be the largest domestic producer of those materials from a secondary source.
NEUT17|In fact, the largest in the United States after this.
BULL18|I have seen through so this is really transformative for the business.
NEUT19|But it gives us a platform to really step out and move ahead.
NEUT20|Alright, so explain to me your ability here to scale.
NEUT21|We would imagine Elon must tweet and everything else that the needs here are going to be quite significant.
NEUT22|If this EV future really is what many believe, how do you scale to the level of getting that lithium carbonate, nickel sulfate, and cobalt sulfate to the extent you need it?
NEUT23|Or are you already there?
NEUT24|Yeah, so we're on the track and I think what really is underpinning this is the technology and the operations were doing the Moat that is be gated by that IP.
NEUT25|So take a step back the way that these batteries have been dealt with till date has really been thermal.
NEUT26|So other companies waste oriented companies, even those that have come out.
NEUT27|The really treating them as a waste and burning off what they don't want.
NEUT28|And only after a small portion of the materials from a sustainability standpoint, usgi standpoint.
NEUT29|That's not a very good impact on the environment and one and two from an economic standpoint, you leave a lot of value on the table and is a high cost method.
NEUT30|So what we're doing is a two stage model.
NEUT31|It's a spoke and hub model at a high level.
NEUT32|Spokes are regional mechanical plants where we take in all types of lift.
BEAR33|My batteries going to intermediate.
NEUT34|Products we have two commercial operating plants do that today.
NEUT35|We have planned for twenty of those over the next five years.
NEUT36|That's really in copy paste mode and we have the second stage technology to your point, where we go back to the lithium nickel cobalt.
NEUT37|Those are the batter grade chemicals that supplant that we're building in Rochester.
NEUT38|In this this transaction fully funds that level, and we have the offtake through 2030 for those materials.
NEUT39|This isn't really commodities.
NEUT40|Their specialties, they're really going to urban mining source of these critical materials to go back into with my batteries again.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
