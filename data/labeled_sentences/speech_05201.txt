BULL0|"""The White House and Congress are cooking up a new stimulus bill."
NEUT1|Will it do more good than harm the fate of the economy in the stock market depends on the answer.
NEUT2|I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to navigate these turbulent times.
BEAR3|White House and Treasury officials are now in furious internal negotiations on what to propose to Congress for another round of measures to help the covid crushed economy.
BULL4|The situation has been improving, but help is needed.
BEAR5|Hurting things is the slowdown, if not reversal in reopenings and several states.
BULL6|Moreover, many local governments around the country are mulling big tax increases.
BEAR7|Because of Covid costs, loss of revenues and those new taxes will also hamper progress.
BEAR8|In addition, the extra $600 a week in unemployment benefits that Congress put on top of regular state unemployment payments has delayed millions of people from RE entering the workforce, with the additional $600 a week, they're getting more money not working than by working that $600 provision expires at the end of the month.
BULL9|But some inside the Trump administration are inclined to renew the bonus, or at least part of it.
BEAR10|But knowledgeable labor market experts warn that any kind of extension will cost the economy millions of jobs and damage, or even halt the recovery.
NEUT11|The best and most immediate economy booster would be to suspend the payroll tax.
BULL12|Such a holiday would increase the income of somebody making $40,000 a year by more than $3000.00 for a $50,000 income.
BULL13|The pay raise would be almost $4000.
BULL14|It would lower the cost to employers to keep existing staff and hire new people.
NEUT15|By a similar amount it's win win.
BEAR16|Yet some Republicans, including the Treasury Department, are lukewarm are opposed outright.
BULL17|Along with this payroll tax suspension, we need another round of stimulus individual checks.
BULL18|The amount should be bigger than the original $1200 of last spring.
NEUT19|It should be $2000 per person or even higher.
NEUT20|Millions of people need the help.
BEAR21|Unfortunately, many Republicans are posted that too.
NEUT22|If the GOP doesn't push both the payroll tax holiday.
NEUT23|And these new individual checks, the economy will falter and stocks will take a big hit and Republicans will pay the price this November.
NEUT24|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL25|Thanks for listening.

BULL27|"I look forward to talking to you soon again."""
