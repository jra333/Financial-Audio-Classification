NEUT6|The concept behind the dog face was to show the growth of altcoins by using the dog Internet meme.
NEUT7|Kind of like a satire.
NEUT8|While it was meant to be a joke, it got efficient and practical with its large supply and low price.
NEUT9|It allows micro chipping content on social media and is a derivative of lucky coin from Litecoin and the algorithm used here is a script algorithm.
NEUT10|Those kind of special because it has one minute block intervals faster than other blockchains.

NEUT12|53960 dollars with a 24 hour percentage change of minus nought .13% the doge coin popularity is boomed so much that it currently holds a market cap value of $6.96 billion.
BULL13|If you want to know where the stock returns sound right now, it's at minus 9.38%, but it seems to be increasing in value and seems attractive to invest in.
NEUT14|Although watch the rest of the video to get keen insight into the journey of this cryptocurrency.
BEAR15|Once this coin was hacked into and many people were able to get their hands on it and this lowered its prices by a lot and was thought to be dead currency after that incident.
BULL16|Despite all that, the investment interest in Doge coin grew and the market capitalization steadily increased in 2018 at the peak of the first wave of the cryptocurrency boom, those coin achieved $2 billion in market cap.
BEAR17|This led to the dismay of its creators as going by Palmer, who wrote an opinion piece of advice where he complained about how the actual community, which was known for its generous tipping culture.
NEUT18|Was quickly displaced by scam artists and get rich quick gurus who perpetrated scam after scam using the currency.
BEAR19|He felt the coin, which could have gotten popular in a different way, was misused.
BEAR20|For other benefits, he repeated a lot of this in his interviews and said that this wasn't going to look good for Doge coin.
NEUT21|However, let's move forward to 2021 Dodge.
NEUT22|Coin is suddenly more valuable than ever.
NEUT23|Elon Musk, who is the world's richest man in the Iron Man of today's world, tweeted to his 50 million odd followers about Doge coin possibly being the future currency of the Earth.
NEUT24|Mia Khalifa also put forward.
NEUT25|Her support is a big investor and user of Doge coin.
NEUT26|Many other popular Hollywood stars who also advocated doge coin and naturally their fan bases and Reddit users also started investing.
BULL27|And making the value go up 8 fold in just a few days.
BULL28|This attracted even the serious investors, as even if those, joke, the people investing in it were not, and such a large momentum for trading is very profitable.

BEAR30|Many analysts have iterated that Doge coins.
NEUT31|Value increase is a legit thing, as now if it costs $0.06, it is 15 times more than a year or half a year ago.
NEUT32|Robin Hood also offers Doge coin trading on its crypto based platform.
BULL33|After Musk and Reddit, those coins become super popular and this is boosted its market cap value by so much converting millions to billions almost.

NEUT35|The timeline and price graph tally perfectly.
NEUT36|Everything seems to be giving it the perfect push and investing.
BULL37|It seems so good.
NEUT38|But according to popular opinions, conservative investors should stay away from those coin as it's limited to a few platforms only and Robin Hood is made a move on it entirely, while predictions about Robin Hood removing doge coin from the trading basis speculated no one is quite sure Bitcoin is always a safe cryptocurrency bet.
BULL39|However, old coins are still on the rise and are making a firm foothold in the market.
NEUT40|So Doge coin might not be far apart in the race.
NEUT41|So what we'd advise is trying out this only if you have extra money and analyzing it properly.
