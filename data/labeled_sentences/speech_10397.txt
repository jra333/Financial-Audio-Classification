NEUT0|"""Squawk box this morning want to get straight over to CMC's headquarters right now our good friend Jim Kramer joins us now."
BULL1|So many things to talk about, but I want to talk about the markets which are moving higher this morning, but there's so many crosscurrents we have the president and we hope he gets better hopefully on the mend that would take some risk off the table.
NEUT2|I would imagine I don't know whether you think this helps or hurts the efforts that stimulus and then on the other end we got the crosscurrent of actually more covid cases.
NEUT3|We just talked to Doctor Scott Gottlieb.
BEAR4|Who's concerned about those not only in New York, but elsewhere around the country and really talked about sadly, what a disgrace we have become on a relative basis to so many other countries around the world.
NEUT5|How do you see this market in those crosscurrents playing against each other?
BULL6|Well, I do think that there's more of a chance for stimulus.
NEUT7|I know that the president is adamant that the states get some money, which is something that that Speaker Pelosi wants.
BULL8|I think that's important common ground.
BEAR9|There did not seem to be a lot of rancor this weekend.
NEUT10|Now may discuss the.
NEUT11|President was supported read, but I think what matters to me is that if there's even a moment that the president shows strength and we do wish him well, I do believe that his supporters will feel heartened and other people might say, you know what?
NEUT12|He's more of a champion than I thought.
NEUT13|Now is that what I'm saying?
NEUT14|No, I'm busy just watching trying to figure out the timeline like Doctor Gottlieb is.
NEUT15|But I know that there's a lot of people who say, you know what?
NEUT16|What right?
NEUT17|Does he have to go outside the hospital?
NEUT18|Ann, I come back and say, look, he's the president.
NEUT19|He will do what he wants.
BULL20|I care that they can have some sort of camaraderie between the Democrats and Republicans.
NEUT21|That's what the people need given the fact that there's another wave of covid and Doctor Gottlieb is is basically saying it's going to happen.
NEUT22|So how can we not have more stimulus?
NEUT23|Particularly where a lot of things that were open or closed.
NEUT24|Jim, when you just real quick on the markets themselves, though you look at them moving higher.
NEUT25|You know look that makes sense to you.
NEUT26|Yeah it does because I think that there the president was somewhat concilia Tori.
NEUT27|The market wants stimulus if they can get stimulus then I think that what would happen is is that the consumer would stay strong and like this is the small medium sized business good for everybody.
NEUT28|At one point we want something that's good for everybody.
BULL29|We don't really want to say hey listen, the other side failed and it's their fault so I'm hoping for some camaraderie.
NEUT30|I don't think that's too much to ask at this point.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
