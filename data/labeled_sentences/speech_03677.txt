BULL0|"""Under Armour's third quarter profits came in higher than expected, sending shares up 25% this week."
NEUT1|Jason, when was the last time we said anything approaching that with Under Armour?
NEUT2|Yeah, I mean just little.
NEUT3|By little it seems like maybe this turn around is starting to take hold.
NEUT4|And I mean when you look at the quarter.
NEUT5|On the whole, there wasn't one thing that really stood out, but it's just progress on all fronts.
BULL6|Really, the international business is still strong.
NEUT7|US is treading water, and I know treading water is not what we really want to hear.
BEAR8|We want to hear more about growth, but it's worth noting that they cut back a lot on promotional stuff.
NEUT9|For for the quarter and so that affected the US business reflected the affected directly consumer of business as well.
BULL10|But inventory management is improving by leaps and bounds.
NEUT11|Most importantly, really in one of the.
BULL12|Hurdles we've held them to here is that the CEO and CFO are still there, blank hasn't scared them away yet, so that is a big plus.
NEUT13|And hey, listen, you've got the rock pushing your stuff still.
NEUT14|I mean, that's just a win in any capacity.
BULL15|So All in all, it's not like they're there yet, but we are seeing signs that this this turn around is starting to take hold Under Armour.
NEUT16|Still a very powerful brand.
BULL17|It sounds like they've come to the realization that they need to maintain that premium status.
NEUT18|In the market as performance gear instead of trying to go performance and fashion and wherever else they may go, I think that's good.
BULL19|The market opportunity is a little bit smaller, but it's a big market opportunity still and they have a reputation in the space for high performance gear anyway.
NEUT20|So All in all, as a shareholder I'm happy all kidding aside, met at the beginning of this year.
NEUT21|That is one of the things that we talked about was Kevin Plank.
BEAR22|For all the things he is done right at that company, he has struggled historically keeping an executive team around him.
NEUT23|And that was one of the things we said was, let's see if we can get through the entire year with the C-Suite still in place.
NEUT24|I know it's it's fine.
NEUT25|It kind of joke about that, but it's true and this is under an example of a founder LED business and we love investing in these kind of companies at the Fool and Under Armour's been a wonderful company to follow and invest in.
NEUT26|But it really well it got to a point where I think Kevin Plank had to realize that there were decisions he was making that he needed more council.
BULL27|He need more advice on so I'm really thrilled to see you here.
NEUT28|Jason said about the CFO and CEO staying on.
BULL29|"It's really key."""
