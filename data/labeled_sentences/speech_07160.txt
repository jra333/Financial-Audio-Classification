NEUT0|"""Alright, next question comes from Doctor YL."
NEUT1|My biggest holding is Netflix, which became 40 to 50% in my main portfolio.
NEUT2|This is a taxable account.
BEAR3|The recent pullback in the stock's price hurt this account substantially.
NEUT4|Since I started investing, I've made nearly 200 by orders and fewer than 10 sell orders.
NEUT5|Overall, I'm very happy with the full approach of buying, holding and not selling, but maybe it's time to stream some Netflix into other stocks heading straight.
NEUT6|So yeah, like that like that.
NEUT7|So first of all, congratulations, we love.
BULL8|Yeah, it's a nice problem to have.
NEUT9|We generally tell people buy in thirds, which means whatever your full position is, you kind of take one bite in 1/3 of that and then two more purchases so you give yourself some time not getting perfect.
NEUT10|He did it in two hundreds, right?
BULL11|So that's awesome.
BULL12|Any added to a great stock?
NEUT13|And he's made a lot of money.
NEUT14|So first of all, congratulations for that.
NEUT15|I would say you know this, we call it the sleep.
BULL16|Well at night test.
BULL17|I mean, here's the thing, I think Netflix is doing very well.
NEUT18|I'm not expert analyst on covering it, but I think most of their kind of potentials in the rest of the world now because they've gotten so much penetration here in the USO.
BULL19|If they can, they've shown great progress in being an attractive offering around the world, so that's great for Netflix.
BEAR20|But anyhow, stocks are volatile from time to time, and if you know a 20 or 30% pullback in Netflix impacts your life, and it sounds like you know the recent pullback was less than that, and maybe kind of shaky a little bit.
NEUT21|It's fine to sell some of that, you know.
NEUT22|I think it's in a taxable account, so you're going to have to pay some taxes, but there's worse things to do than pay taxes, or once in awhile we got to do that.
NEUT23|I would say a 10% range.
NEUT24|I started to get a little bit.
NEUT25|Uncomfortable maybe, but that's a personal thing.
NEUT26|40 and 50%.
BEAR27|I mean, if you have a 20% drop in that that hit your portfolio at 10%, that's pretty big hit.
NEUT28|So I think you're wise to be thinking.
NEUT29|Maybe this is a little bit uncomfortable and you can take some out.
NEUT30|Another great way to do this without paying taxes if you're currently saving and adding money to your savings is to re balance with new money by buying other things.
NEUT31|That way you don't have to sell your Netflix, you can just buy some of the other positions that you like in that percentage.
BEAR32|Your portfolio will naturally go down.
NEUT33|Unless of course, the stock does wonderfully well.
NEUT34|But so those are two options.
NEUT35|You can do.
NEUT36|Both of them had.
NEUT37|Don't add any money to Netflix.
NEUT38|You can kind of just add money to other things and then if you feel like it, you can kind of sell it down a little bit.
BEAR39|Yeah, so the stock is down 20% since June.
NEUT40|There have been times in Netflix's history.
BEAR41|It's been down more than 70%.
NEUT42|Thanks, yeah, yeah, yeah, so it's definitely a concern.
NEUT43|I would have tax consequences are unfortunate or fortunate.
NEUT44|I mean it's always better to pay capital gains taxes then to take capital losses.
NEUT45|But if you have made multiple purchases over your history of holding it, you can determine which shares you're selling and choose the cost basis that is best for your situation.
NEUT46|To be quite honest, given that tax rates are pretty low, not knowing your particular situation, it might be a good time actually to take the big game.
NEUT47|Now, if you expect to be in a higher tax bracket in the future, or if you expect tax rates to go up in the future to find some way to pay for Social Security and Medicare and all that stuff.
NEUT48|So I'm not saying that you should actually should necessarily choose the highest basis shares you might want to choose the low space shares and bite that bullet today.
NEUT49|Depends on your tax situation, but basically you do have a little bit control over that right in to the extent.
NEUT50|If you do sell some of that, you can look through your.
NEUT51|Portfolio for some offsetting losses to cancel out some of those gains and balance him out.
NEUT52|I don't know if you have that or not, but that's always a good thing to do at the end of every year.
NEUT53|Anyhow, some tax loss selling you can buy them back, and 30 + 30 days and do that if you want.
NEUT54|"But anyhow, that's something else to kind of consider."""
