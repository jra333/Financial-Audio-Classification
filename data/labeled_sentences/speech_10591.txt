NEUT0|"""Now there are some other themes that are working in."
NEUT1|Assuming we get a blue wave, Biden could be great for some of the cannabis teams have more on that later in the show called a tease would be fabulous renewable energy truck, close fossil fuels, oil, gas, even coal.
NEUT2|Hey, by the way, The Dirty the better because it's good for U.S. jobs and the president is trouble with global warming concept.
NEUT3|He once oil companies drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.
NEUT4|The thing is, there's only so much the president calls dead.
NEUT5|Nobody wants to build new coal plants when the next Democrat in the White House will take them down.
BEAR6|No oil company wants to drill in Anwar because they'll be crucified if anything goes wrong.
NEUT7|It's not economic, it's not worth the trouble.
NEUT8|Meanwhile, under Trump, we've seen a huge game in renewables because, like it or not, there the future.
NEUT9|If Biden wins, though, the Democrats are eager to throw money at solar, that's what they do.
NEUT10|OK, which is why the stocks are running now.
NEUT11|I like free solar place.
NEUT12|There's that straightforward one must first solar endorsed by JMP today on the strength of its backlog Generac.
NEUT13|We had them on recently.
NEUT14|It's essential for storage so your power doesn't go out when the sun goes down.
NEUT15|And Tesla, which has a big solar business.
NEUT16|Remember when Elon Musk floated the idea at a dinner that I went to that I was just a simulation that was more than five years ago?
NEUT17|I challenged this idea that we'd all get our electricity from a giant solar field and reckless Colorado.
NEUT18|That was his plan.
NEUT19|In reality, it won't be concentrated like that.
NEUT20|Fortunately, must have figured that out hit the future.
NEUT21|Looks like a lot.
NEUT22|Lots of distributed solar panels that flow back into the grid.
NEUT23|Tesla Solar biz can help make that happen.
NEUT24|Meanwhile, first Solar makes the actual solar modules and this one feels like a stealing candy from a baby situation.
BULL25|Companies already in great position, so Biden wins.
NEUT26|They'll make a fortune, frankly, anyone of these solar companies for the next two weeks going to work.
NEUT27|You actually don't need particular, you'd like to say that, but it's true.
BULL28|What else I see a lot of infrastructure in place that are rallying, though they gave up the ghost this afternoon.
NEUT29|I keep recommending Cat and Deere, but if there's a Democratic sweep you could see a major infrastructure package, but I've heard so many guys yapping about this.
BEAR30|It's very unoriginal all day.
NEUT31|I heard it's a focal materials at Martin Marietta, you know, whatever but you know what?
NEUT32|I'll add waste management to that amalgam.
NEUT33|We own it for the travel trust.
NEUT34|They make a fortune cleaning up after new construction, but before you buy these stocks, betting on Biden, stimulus bill, let's think this through those who own US concrete.
NEUT35|Think this through.
NEUT36|Remember, we've been this through this thing since 2009.
NEUT37|Even with an infrastructure bill, our government has forgotten how to build things.
NEUT38|By the time that money gets through the states, it can take years before they start construction.
NEUT39|This is an Eisenhower's America we can put that Interstate Highway System right up there.
NEUT40|It's 2020 where they hire a bunch of consultants to loot the budget.
NEUT41|Maybe bring a couple dozen guys with a couple of machines sitting by the road.
NEUT42|You get the picture.
NEUT43|The things we could do to get our infrastructure group back, but it can't happen overnight and maybe we can't even do it.
