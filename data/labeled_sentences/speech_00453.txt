BULL0|"""On the deal put so far on a fast track to expand its banking business, the Fintech company plans to buy Golden Pacific Bank."
NEUT1|Or that's a small community lender in California for about $22 million.
NEUT2|This is all part of Sofia's plan to bring banking services in house.
NEUT3|So instead of using a third party, they want to be the ones holding customer deposits and issuing loans.
NEUT4|So if I had already applied for a National Bank charter but now instead of applying to be a brand new bank, it will apply to be a bank.
NEUT5|Holding company a few reasons to do this.
NEUT6|For one, it's a lot cheaper.
BULL7|CEO Anthony Noto telling CNBC this morning that the move could save them as much as $300 million and so far is not the only fintech company looking to cut costs.
NEUT8|Lending Club was really the trailblazer here.
NEUT9|Buying radius Bank last year.
NEUT10|Vera Money was approved for its own charter and squares bank officially launched last week.
BEAR11|If the trend continues though, analysts tell me that it could be bad news for those small community banks.
NEUT12|That have been handling the customer deposits for fintechs so far.
NEUT13|And remember Sophie announced in January it was merging with a SPAC run by Chamath Poly Hoppity a that deal is expected to close in a couple of weeks, but take a look at shares of that Blank Check Company today.
BULL14|It's been up as much as 16% today.
NEUT15|John, back to you, you know we were talking to Anthony no dough this morning about this move and I was trying to figure out whether this sort of US version of the Challenger bank boom has some danger.
NEUT16|In it, and he seemed to imply that with this move they become a bank.
NEUT17|They're going to be able to offer interest rates much higher than typical, that they won't be as locked into the mode that banks typically are an.
NEUT18|I mean, that's a risk for them, right?
NEUT19|'cause that's they're giving money away at a higher level, kind of as a marketing thing.
NEUT20|Is there kind of a proven track record for that kind of model?
NEUT21|It's been interesting and put some closer to the regulators so it cuts out the middleman and they have direct contact with the regulators sound so in that sense it's a risk.
NEUT22|The onus is on them if anything goes wrong.
BEAR23|This is now sofies problem versus a small community bank, but as far as the interest rate that has really been help.
NEUT24|Fintechs have been competing, it's how they get people in.
NEUT25|They offer a higher interest rate and often they lower that rate, which so far has done.
BEAR26|Wealthfront has done so as interest rates gone down.
NEUT27|They've been forced to sort of dial that back, but that has been the way that people and fintechs have been competing in this market.
NEUT28|Who can offer the most money in return on your deposits?
NEUT29|So we'll see if they're able to do that.
BULL30|It could also be a good customer acquisition channel.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
