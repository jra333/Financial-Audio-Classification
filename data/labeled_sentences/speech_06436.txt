NEUT0|"""He is claiming this via video chart on ticker symbol SYN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT8|Could say up there above $0.82.
NEUT9|Now.
BEAR10|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 82, that does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that area.
BULL11|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view, that is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword.
BULL15|Definitely moving.
BEAR16|I get the price is way up there.
NEUT17|This line is way down here, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and getting more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move.
NEUT18|That right there were being defined as the move.
NEUT19|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT21|Having us visualize that.
NEUT22|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT23|Yeah, stand above that level would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|Main battleground moving forward all about that 96 cent mark.
NEUT25|I mean if you go back into the past history and look.
NEUT26|At things, so I mean right here you can see 96 was exactly where it got rejected from right there and then you look at its rejection point today right there.
NEUT27|So I'm not saying 96 camper broken, I'm just saying it's become very apparent that that is, you know, definitely with some sellers are hanging out at.
NEUT28|So if there is going to be any sort of further upside momentum that is very clearly that main battleground that will first need to be cleared out of the way.
NEUT29|But let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR36|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
