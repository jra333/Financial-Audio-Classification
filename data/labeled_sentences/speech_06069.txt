BULL0|"""Guys Exo West Limited is up nearly 60% and this is a stock that someone might discord has been telling me about."
NEUT1|And finally I'm looking at it shouted to Drew.
NEUT2|If you're watching this video, thanks for showing me the stockmen guys that so it's like I said it's up.
NEUT3|60% is currently trading at $11.86.
NEUT4|Obviously by the time the market closes I'm not too sure what's going to be, but I want to say literally 5 days ago on Wednesday of last week the stock was trading at $4 a share.
BULL5|Guys, we saw a huge spike today and personally I think that this is going to continue.
NEUT6|I did do a decent amount of research and.
NEUT7|My personal due diligence and in this video we tell you guys what exactly this talk is about, why it went up today, and pretty much where I see it going long term.
NEUT8|So to start off, this is a company that is focused on emergency rescue services, working with health care providers, insurance companies and financial institutions.
NEUT9|SOS Limited utilizes blockchain and Big Data Technologies to provide marketing and cloud computing services to its partners in the sector.
NEUT10|The company also dabbles in the Internet of Things and Artificial intelligence, but here's what makes this company very, very interesting.
NEUT11|The company on Tuesday, February 9th received 5000 cryptocurrency mining computers ahead of the scheduled delivery date.
NEUT12|If you guys don't know about mining cryptocurrencies pretty much and again, I'm not the expert on this, but pretty much you can mine crypto currencies and pretty much set up these machines and these rigs and they will pretty much produce crypto currencies essentially for free like you don't actually buy the crypto currencies, you just set these machines up and they'll consistently like generate crypto currencies and.
NEUT13|A lot of people do, I guess.
NEUT14|Mine crypto currencies, as I guess if a side hustle or you know you can just set up a few rigs, but this seems to be a company that's actually going all in on mining crypto currencies as a way to profit in their company.
BEAR15|Also I should say the stock is very volatile right now.
NEUT16|Again, I'm currently recording this at 2:00 PM and already the stocks at $12.25.
BULL17|Strongly recommend guys.
NEUT18|Check it out in the market closes.
NEUT19|Another interesting catalyst is Kevin O'Leary has actually been talking about the stock and really likes it as well.
NEUT20|Here's another thing to me that is.
NEUT21|Very very interesting.
BULL22|I if you guys already know I'm someone who really bleeds into cryptocurrency and I am pretty invested into Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple, and if I know that hey, the price of Bitcoin is going to go up long term.
NEUT23|Obviously the company SOS since they are mining Bitcoin or whatever cryptocurrencies are mining, they're obviously going to be reaping the rewards similarly to how Tesla has made more profit holding Bitcoin, they have selling cars in the past decade, or some crazy statistic like that.
NEUT24|Just knowing these type of statistics and knowing the power.
NEUT25|And the potential with crypto.
NEUT26|This company seems like something that is a long term hold.
NEUT27|Now at this price point of told Ars and $0.22, I'm currently not going to be starting my position, but I will be adding to My Portfolio once there is some small dips.
NEUT28|Obviously there is a lot of hype around the stock right now and there's a lot of people.
NEUT29|Just I guess trading it and really looking to get in.
NEUT30|And you know, a lot of people are going through what's called FOMO, which is fear of missing out.
NEUT31|They don't want to miss out on the upside and they want to just get in, get in, get in, and So what happens when people get burned and me personally I'm not going to follow this.
NEUT32|I'm just going to wait and I'm going to see what happens.
NEUT33|But like I said.
BULL34|The stock is up 65% right now.
NEUT35|I want to wait for a dip and then look into buying.
NEUT36|Let me know down in the comments below guys what do you guys think about SOS?
NEUT37|Are you guys going to be buying and make sure you join my free disk or down below?
NEUT38|Like I said when this does dip 'cause usually you know when stocks are super volatile like this there do tend to be quite a few dips and some pull backs and that's when I will be personally looking to buy and start opening a position.
