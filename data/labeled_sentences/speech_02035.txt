NEUT0|"""Yeah, well if I'm an investor at in recent Horowitz right now I am hosting a good crying session inside Clubhouse tonight because we have Spotify, the biggest company in Internet audio coming to eat our lunch."
NEUT1|And that's really what this is about.
NEUT2|Spotify is already proven.
NEUT3|It wants to be the Netflix of audio and now it's hopping on this next big trend in just not just in podcasting but all social media.
NEUT4|You have Facebook, you have Twitter, you have Microsoft thinking about it.
BULL5|And now Spotify is getting an early by buying a relatively small company.
NEUT6|But saying hey, we're signaling to everyone we're going to do this too, and we're going to build it ourselves instead of going out and buying a billion dollar clubhouse or buying a $10 billion discord, they're going to do it all on their own.
BULL7|And on top of that, it gives so much more opportunity to the creators.
NEUT8|They're trying to attract to their platform for podcasting and giving him the tools they need to either do podcasting in the traditional sense, or these live audio chats that have become so popular.
NEUT9|Everything you say makes sense, Steve.
NEUT10|My question and there's obviously no right way to answer this yet.
NEUT11|Is does this really have staying power?
NEUT12|That's going to really be a big growth area for any of these companies.
NEUT13|You can see how it was popular during the pandemic when a lot of celebrities are stuck at home and everybody is craving human interaction of some kind, but it does rest on the star power, the leaders, the artists that the people who you have access to.
NEUT14|They're going to get back to their busy crazy lives at some point, right?
NEUT15|Absolutely, and that's where Spotify's superpower is.
NEUT16|Right now they have that talent.
NEUT17|They have Joe Rogan.
NEUT18|They have the Obamas.
NEUT19|They have Bruce Springsteen, they have all these exclusive podcast deals.
NEUT20|They have the talent already locked up.
NEUT21|You on Musk might join the clubhouse chat every once in awhile.
NEUT22|Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates.
NEUT23|They might join it every once in awhile, but Spotify is real key.
NEUT24|Weapon is not only are they building out the technology they were tracking these star creators these star celebrities to do these things solely on their platform.
NEUT25|And by building this out, it's kind of an insurance policy.
NEUT26|Let's say this live audio chat thing doesn't take off after the pandemic.
NEUT27|Let's say it just fizzles out.
NEUT28|They have this great insurance policy that they didn't have to spend a billion dollars on for an app like clubhouse and just in case it doesn't take off their fine.
BULL29|Steve Spotify moving up to two point 2% as you speak.
BULL30|Thank you, Sir, for joining us.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
