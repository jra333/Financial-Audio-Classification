NEUT0|"""Welcome to the FT market minute."
NEUT1|Here's what we're watching in London on Friday morning after a quiet start in Europe, the tone is turning a bit more bearish.
BEAR2|The Euro Stoxx 600 index is down 9.4%.
BEAR3|The dollar is turning higher against the euro and Sterling, but is softer versus the yen and bond yields are nudging lower.
BEAR4|With benchmark Treasuries at 2.44% and buns off 2 basis points to North .33%.
BEAR5|Now all those moves are classic signs of waning risk appetite, but we can forgive traders their caution.
BEAR6|Wall Street will be closed on Monday for Presidents Day, so perhaps some investors are wary about making bold bets into the long weekend.
BULL7|And if we're generous, we can describe Friday's action as consolidation after the Trump base reflation trade help with global stocks to record highs this week.
BEAR8|Now US futures suggest the S&P 500 will differ few points later in New York, leaving the Wall Street benchmark a fraction of its record.
NEUT9|Can it power on from here while the fourth quarter earnings season is winding down so there is unlikely to be a little momentum from that corner.
BULL10|Perhaps some meat on the bones of President Trump's tax policy will help.
NEUT11|"The question is how much of that is already baked into valuations."""
