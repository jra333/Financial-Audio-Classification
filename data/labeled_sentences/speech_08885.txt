NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys, it's your boy will back into the video today."
NEUT1|I'll be talking about AMC stock.
NEUT2|I'm giving you guys my AMC stock predictions on my AMC stock analysts going forward to next week.
NEUT3|I did make a play on antique stock today.
NEUT4|It was a quick play, maybe like 10-15 minutes type play.
NEUT5|Show you guys that and I also put that in my discord so you guys will just saw when I was saying some key levels, so make sure you guys like the video.
NEUT6|Hit that subscribe button, turn on post notifications.
NEUT7|It is my birthday on Sunday so I probably won't be on Sunday.
NEUT8|I probably could post a couple of videos but make sure you guys like the video.
NEUT9|For my happy birthday weekend so.
NEUT10|This is the resistance that I had.
BULL11|If it broke through that level, I'll be very bullish 1707.
NEUT12|As you can tell, is very far from that, so I'm just leaving that there just in case we do get a quick pop up and this is a line that I wanted to buy off of at $5.16.
BULL13|This is a good buy, an area that I see.
NEUT14|But as you can tell, it gets close and it quickly goes away from it and it's just hovering above this level.
BULL15|So I do think there is some buying pressure on this level, and if it does get there, we might see a quick bounce something like this.
NEUT16|That's what I'm looking for right there.
NEUT17|Let me show you guys the play that I did today, so right right here.
NEUT18|I was talking on the discord this morning and I was saying that price is going to go above is going to make new high.
NEUT19|So it's going to go above 735.
NEUT20|You guys can check on my Discord link down below you so you can see it.
NEUT21|I said Price was going to go above 7735 and that was a trigger for everybody to get in.
NEUT22|I like using keywords right?
NEUT23|So I did get in on the call option today for $20 and then this stock just ran up and then I sold it for 70.
NEUT24|So that was a quick $50 play.
BEAR25|Within 15 minutes I was going to go heavy but I just went small since this Friday.
NEUT26|In the contracts expire today.
NEUT27|So I went small to play.
NEUT28|I gotta know I got in on this kannalane I got out on that candle.
NEUT29|OK that's why I say you guys want to be in the discord and you guys want to be on the Patreon so you get plays like that.
NEUT30|I was looking for a quick play like you guys know and AMC 'cause it does have these pops, right?
NEUT31|So on Monday?
NEUT32|I'm looking for another pop.
BEAR33|It has been trading sideways just in this range.
BEAR34|Kind of this been going up but it came down down.
BEAR35|It's going down again.
NEUT36|It's kind of been in this range so I'm trying to see how I react at this level or if it wants to start pushing up like above.
NEUT37|The eight dollar $9 area so we need to wait to see what Monday holes if it start going above the $8.00 area.
NEUT38|I think that would be short term bullish, but if it starts going below 6 I think that would be short term bearish and then we will wait to see how I react with this low and that would give us some more insight OK?
NEUT39|So that's how I'm playing AMC stock.
BULL40|Hope you guys like this video.
NEUT41|Make sure none of this recommendation, a virus or anything, just educational purposes only.
NEUT42|"So do not trade anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
