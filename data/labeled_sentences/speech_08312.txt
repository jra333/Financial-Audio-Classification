NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead."
BULL1|Washington will be spending trillions of dollars to revive our battered economy.
BEAR2|This has some people worrying that this will create another problem.
NEUT3|All of this new money, and that is inflation.
BEAR4|Inflation always leads to another economic crisis.
NEUT5|So what is going to happen?
NEUT6|What should we do?
NEUT7|Unfortunately, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, says inflation is the furthest worry from his mind.
NEUT8|Oh, we've seen this movie before back in the 1970s, the Fed printed a lot of new money that lead to inflation.
BEAR9|Higher, lower standard of living, rising prices and three ever more serious recessions and bad unemployment in the early 2000s.
NEUT10|The same mistake was made again.
NEUT11|the Fed printed too much money.
BEAR12|The dollar was weak and this led to asset bubbles, especially with housing, and we know how that ended.
NEUT13|So how should Washington finance all of this new spending without doing more damage to our economy?
NEUT14|What it should do is issue bonds while we tap existing savings here and overseas.
NEUT15|So we use existing money to finance these programs.
NEUT16|This of course leads to a very basic question of people always want to know how does the Fed create more money?
NEUT17|What it does is it goes to the bond market and buys bonds.
NEUT18|How does it pay for the bonds?
NEUT19|Well, accredits the seller's bank account with money that the Fed created out of thin air.
NEUT20|It just says you have the money.
NEUT21|And by golly in our financial system, that's all it takes.
NEUT22|It creates it literally out of nothing.
BEAR23|But if it creates too much, it creates problems.
BULL24|So let us hope Washington has learned from the past before it's too late we can finance these programs in a way that does the job of getting our hard hit economy up and running again, and doing so without creating even more problems down the road.
NEUT25|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL26|"Thank you again for listening and looking forward to talking to you soon again."""
