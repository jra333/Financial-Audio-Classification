BEAR0|"""The Q1 numbers again be very bad."
BEAR1|I mean we know that the economy contracted in the first quarter.
NEUT2|The only question now is whether they'll show it on the figures.
BEAR3|That said, they have been surprisingly willing to show weakness in some of the other data that we already have things to industrial production in the cell an almost 15%.
NEUT4|So we had services output.
NEUT5|Which film is 15% as well in the first month of the year, and those are typically quite good guys to what happens to GDP.
BEAR6|So if we don't get a negative GDP for in Q1.
NEUT7|That would be very surprising and raise significant questions about the quality of the data.
BEAR8|And once you know they publish a negative growth rate for Q1, it's going to be very hard, especially given that the external headwinds.
BEAR9|To reach politically powerful growth rate for the year as a whole, and you know, like I said, I mean with the exports could contract 50% in the second quarter and exports still drive about 15% of Chinese GDP in value added terms so.
BULL10|A 50% full there is going to be a significant drag even this domestic activity is getting back on track, so I think any target there would be politically acceptable.
NEUT11|Is going to be basically unachievable.
NEUT12|In practice, I think they'll seriously consider just dropping the target altogether.
NEUT13|What is the number on Friday going to look like?
NEUT14|And could you argue that the fact that the trade numbers that we got out today, perhaps China is setting the market up for an upside surprise when it comes to the official GDP print on Friday?
BEAR15|Yes, I mean we expected most of the March data to actually worse than the Jennifer every data because all high frequency figures that we've been looking at suggest that even though there was an improvement in March, the March activity was still weaker than across the first two months as a whole.
NEUT16|Now the trade data you know, put that into question and and, you know, does suggest that.
BULL17|Perhaps March could be a bit stronger than we expected.
BEAR18|Even then, I think you're still looking at a double digit contraction in GDP, and we're currently forecasting minus 16% in Q1.
BEAR19|It might be a bit less than that, maybe minus 12 -- 10, but we're still looking at a very sizable contraction GDP I'd imagine if we don't see that.
NEUT20|As I said, I think it will certainly raise some questions given how we call the main indicators have been so far this quarter.
NEUT21|Do you have a forecast for the Chinese currency?
NEUT22|As some economists were talking about 7.17 point 2 by the end of this year.
NEUT23|How do things look?
NEUT24|So aren't you?
NEUT25|In forecast is 7.2 an.
BEAR26|I think that there are some downside risk for them being in the Rubies held up.
BEAR27|You're remarkably well against most currencies given all the market volatility recently, but that will actually be problematic for China to some degree, because we've actually had trade weighted appreciation in the Roman be, which is going to further away on the export sector.
BEAR28|And more broadly, I mean China's external position is deteriorating pretty quickly.
BEAR29|You know, given the outlook for exports, would probably going to see the first current account deficit in a number of decades.
BEAR30|This year, FDI is probably going to slow significantly and so they're not going to be getting the same degree of foreign currency inflows to fund their outflows.
BULL31|And I do think we'll see greater pressure on the on the exchange rate later in the year as a result.
