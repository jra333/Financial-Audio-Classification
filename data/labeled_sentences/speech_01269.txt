BEAR0|"""Hey, what's going on?"
NEUT1|Guys?
NEUT2|Welcome back to this series where we take a look at the best performing penny stocks on the entire market with the best returns.
NEUT3|Today has been a very exciting and eventful day, so we're going to talk about these three.
NEUT4|Keep in mind that nobody knows about these stocks and we're always the first to cover them, so if you're not already subscribed, go ahead and do so right now to give yourself a pretty significant edge over the market.
BULL5|Alright everyone, thank you for joining me again with another video.
NEUT6|Now you know the deal, leave a like support the channel, support yourself and make some money.
NEUT7|We're going to be talking about the best 3 penny stocks for today in order from least gains the most gains.
NEUT8|Starting out with number 3, this one's called Trans Global Group and their stock ticker is TGI.
NEUT9|Now don't get tricked by this because descriptions of penny stocks are not always what they seem.
NEUT10|And here they list themselves as a solar energy company.
NEUT11|And after trying my hardest and going through tons of reports, this company just isn't giving much information about itself to the public.
NEUT12|But Despite that, we were able to find a Twitter accounts related to this stock with posts as recent as September 29, with images supplied of their THC and alcohol combination device.
NEUT13|So this stock has been getting a ton of attention as of recently.
BULL14|That's why it's up 69% today and close to 7000% in the last 52 weeks.
NEUT15|All right?
BULL16|Moving on to a number 2 stock.
NEUT17|This one is also interesting.
BULL18|Trading at just under a penny, going up only 56% today, but close to 8000% in the course of the last 52 weeks.
NEUT19|It's called Emerging World Pharma and their stock ticker is EWPI.
NEUT20|A lot of people are looking at this stock because their market cap is very small at just under a million.
NEUT21|So if you bought a couple $1000 worth of shares in this company, you own a pretty significant chunk of the company, and that's not necessarily a very bad idea, because this is one of the hottest industries to invest in right now.
NEUT22|So the gist of this company is that it invests in generic based pharmaceutical companies manufacturing within developing nations.
BULL23|So it's going to help them out with infrastructure, hiring new people and training those people so not only does this penny stock at a very good Rep for what the concept is behind the company, but they're actually still very cheap and it's.
NEUT24|Easy to buy.
NEUT25|A big chunk of it, and with this industry likely being a very hot sector for the coming two to three years, EWP is a penny stock that you need to keep your eyes on regardless.
BULL26|And that brings us to our number one stock for today.
BULL27|This one is radically different, but it's up a ton more today.
NEUT28|We're again talking about a diamond company.
NEUT29|This one's called NRP stone.
NEUT30|Their stock ticker is NRP now.
BULL31|It may only be up 9% today when it was just six.
BULL32|It just changed, but it was up 17,000% in the last 52 weeks.
NEUT33|Now this is all very unclear to everyone, but there seems to be a radical spur of people buying up diamond stocks.
NEUT34|And that's exactly what this company is, because it deals with precious metals.
NEUT35|It does a lot with jewelry, diamonds, Golden looks, ium, and obviously the concept behind that is that prices of those things are heavily affected by the pandemic.
NEUT36|For example, whenever there's uncertainty in the markets, the price of gold tends to go up by a lot, and right now we're seeing a ton of people buy into these diamond stocks as well.
NEUT37|And this is just a very cheap one of those with a market cap of only 529 thousand.
NEUT38|So yeah, this is a very small diamond stock, and it's definitely a very cool stock to hold, so you should check it out if you're interested in that niche.
NEUT39|Again, their stock ticker is NRP, but let me know what you think about these three very cheap penny stocks and again, go ahead and subscribe to the channel to stay up to date on all these latest market moves and be ahead of the curve.
BULL40|"So if you made it all the way to the end of this video, let me just say that I really, really appreciate it and I'll see you in the next one."""
