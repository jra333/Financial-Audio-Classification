BULL0|"""Hello guys, welcome back to the channel today."
BULL1|I am going to talk about Neo's Friday market performance and mentioned a new target given by another Japanese financial institution which predicts a huge upside in the share price.
NEUT2|Stay tuned and let's hop right into the video.
BEAR3|First of all, Neo has gained more than 6% on Friday trading session, closing the day slightly below $62.00 Mark.
BULL4|The strong performance came after a new high target was given by another Japanese institution.
NEUT5|Nomura Nomura Securities is the largest securities brokerage as well as oldest brokerage firm in Japan.
NEUT6|The Japanese company gave Neo a price target of $80.30 just days after its rival, Daiwa Securities, issued a $100 price target for the Chinese automaker, the Nomura analyst Martin Hume wrote that he likes Neo for its Tesla like Top Down approach to product Cadence.
NEUT7|Neo, like Tesla started with a premium product such as the S8, followed by more consumer friendly models.
NEUT8|Yes, six in DC.
NEUT9|6 crossovers.
NEUT10|The idea is that the profits from the more expensive models will help fund the development of more affordable models.
NEUT11|Over time.
BULL12|The analyst also regards Neos batteries as a service program as a revolutionary concept that lowers upfront costs, creates a revenue stream for NEO overtime, and provides a competitive advantage versus traditional recharging.
NEUT13|It is really worth noting that the $80.30 target given by Nomura and $100 target given by Daiwa Securities.
NEUT14|Make them one of the biggest St Bulls as the average target given by other companies was in the region of $60.00 in my recent videos I have talked about other targets given for NEO, such as $75 target given by JP Morgan.
BULL15|Positive targets given by many financial institutions are expected to drive Neos price even higher.
BULL16|Same with sales as Neo has recently brought back the No Down Payment scheme back to the customers and is building a new factory to keep up with a huge demand for its vehicles.
BULL17|As always, thank you for watching.
