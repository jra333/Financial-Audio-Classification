NEUT4|Find a stock.
NEUT5|This is the most obvious and most difficult step in stock trading with well over 10,000 stocks to trade a good rule of thumb to consider as time of the year.
NEUT6|For example, as I write this, it is the beginning of spring.
NEUT7|It would make sense to consider stocks that traditionally make runs or slide if you are bearish during this time of year.
BEAR8|Two fundamental analysis, many short term traders may disagree with the need to do any fundamental analysis.
NEUT9|However, knowing the chart patterns from the past and the news regarding the stock is relevant.
NEUT10|An example would be earnings season.
NEUT11|If you are planning on playing a stock to the upside that has missed its earnings target the last three quarters, caution could be in order.
NEUT12|3 technical analysis.

NEUT16|First, learn their intricacies and you'll be sure to make better trades for follow your picks.
NEUT17|Once you have placed a few stock trades, you should be managing them properly.
