NEUT0|"""We were talking about slowdowns and for Google a couple quarters ago, so you know and it was just a few years ago when I, as a value investor, got into Facebook because of concerns about growth."
BEAR1|So I do think that the call was a bit of a blip.
NEUT2|I don't think management was compelling and they didn't seem to be on their game, and you're absolutely right, people were saying, did you just say?
NEUT3|But when you look at Facebook as the maturing?
NEUT4|Asset, you know, as an investor, I say Yep, I think I knew that.
NEUT5|What surprised me more than yesterday's sell off was the run up after April or late March early April.
NEUT6|We were selling into that strength.
NEUT7|We still own it.
NEUT8|We still own a pretty good chunk, but we sold about 1/4 of our Holdings.
BEAR9|'cause we were concerned about Cambridge Analytica and GDP are and and slow down in usage.
NEUT10|But the story really is Instagram Messenger and WhatsApp and how to monetize.
BEAR11|And that's part of why the revenues are slowing.
NEUT12|Obviously because it's not.
NEUT13|It's not happening quick enough.
NEUT14|Are you are you buying more today?
BEAR15|I would like to see it settled because when constituencies change it becomes dead money for awhile and I think the growth investors are going to be really ticked off.
NEUT16|I mean we saw that in after hours and I think they're going to step to the sidelines, so we probably will add 'cause we have room to.
BULL17|It's still in our by ranges from a valuation standpoint, but it needs to re calibrate even with slowing growth.
NEUT18|It's only trading at a multiple about in the low 20s mid 20s.
NEUT19|You know it's not Netflix so.
BEAR20|I think I think this is a bit overdone and I think management needs to make the case.
NEUT21|What I just want to understand about the infection that seems to be taking place across all of thing as a function of this and whether that's.
BEAR22|Whether the whether they contain down by the contagion matters or their super scriber growth, I would argue less than 2% off of Amazon, which has been up modestly.
NEUT23|This year is not much of a trade, but also when Google reported few days ago earlier they you know they upside surprise.
BULL24|That was really nice for investors.
NEUT25|If you were in Google and they were subscribers, did we did show some weakness so we know, so I think they each have their own story.
NEUT26|I think we we like to sort of think of the Fang stories one story and I think as a growth thing.
NEUT27|Yes, maybe, but.
NEUT28|We're getting into nuanced now, right?
BEAR29|I think for a company that's going 42% refuse an then tanking like that is a pretty.
NEUT30|That's the context for that point.
NEUT31|Is this a moment where you're not going to see the Fang stocks still be a trade like Kramer called Fang so far in advance right?
NEUT32|Exactly did trade as a group?
NEUT33|Is this the moment where I think they need to start?
NEUT34|I think you need to really start looking them individually.
NEUT35|I think.
NEUT36|Again, the Google Facebook sort of difference there I think tells us a lot in terms of how one Google is growing at 25%, but investors liked it when they when they saw the results.
BULL37|42% for Facebook.
NEUT38|I think the they still own Facebook still owns three of the top five apps in the App Store right now, so it's not as if people are running away from the service.
NEUT39|I think the nuances of how do they monetize?
NEUT40|How do they get more ad inventory into the service?
NEUT41|And that's the key thing.
BEAR42|They actually flag Facebook flag that a year ago they said we're running out of ad inventory, not just because we want we don't, but also because they've moved into.
NEUT43|We should go to Julie, but they've also moved into products like stories that make it much more difficult for them to monetize the particular.
NEUT44|They've actually built products that are harder to monetize.
