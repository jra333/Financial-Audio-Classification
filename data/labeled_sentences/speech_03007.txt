BEAR0|"""There is a storm brewing about Facebook Ferness and all that stock sold after."
NEUT1|So much excitement investigations have begun.
NEUT2|Lawsuits have been filed and here's the critical question where Wall Street insiders given secret information about the company.
BEAR3|While ordinary people were not today the stock rose $1.00 over yesterday, but it's still well below its offering price, so we spent the day asking how much did the insiders make on the sale and how much did it cost everyone else?
NEUT4|Here's ABC's bill Weir with some answers.
NEUT5|It was supposed to be a crowning week for newlywed and new billionaire Mark Zuckerberg.
BEAR6|Instead, the CEO is now being sued by thousands of investors who accused Facebook and their bankers of withholding key information about the inflated value of the company.
NEUT7|So let's do this.
NEUT8|So when the average investor was lining up to buy on Friday, those elite few in the know we're poised to sell for a quick profit.
NEUT9|The individual investor is always at a massive disadvantage to.
NEUT10|Professional Wall Street traders case in Point college student Alper Ida know Lou it was an 11% last he could only 410 shares of Facebook, far from the status of qualified investors.
NEUT11|Someone with a net worth of at least $2,000,000.
NEUT12|These are the kind of shareholders who get a preferred price long before the stock even begins trading their banks and advisors spend hundreds of 1,000,000 on research and the most powerful computers to squeeze every tiny advantage.
NEUT13|An analogy would be a weekend warrior tennis player sort of thing.
BULL14|Hey, I hit a good shot once in awhile.
NEUT15|And go to Wimbledon.
NEUT16|I'll take a set off.
NEUT17|Roger Federer.
NEUT18|No, you won't.
NEUT19|And on Wall Street it's the same thing.
NEUT20|Big investors are just getting better information.
NEUT21|Neither Zuckerberg nor Facebook have commented since Friday.
NEUT22|But go to the site and you see the kind of frustration that drove the early Occupy Wall Street movement.
BULL23|Zuckerberg is just pulled another fast one, but on a much bigger scale, says one poster.
NEUT24|The big investors made out like a bandit.
NEUT25|The first day.
NEUT26|The only ones who made millions and billions were the ones who had.
NEUT27|Millions and billions of shares.
NEUT28|Will you keep playing the markets after this experience?
NEUT29|Absolutely, but.
NEUT30|Oh what I learned from this experience is that I should be extra careful and do a lot more research and be a lot more cautious.
BULL31|So despite the cataclysmic IPO, Morgan Stanley, the big bank that under wrote this for Facebook, made $100 million profit.
BEAR32|There are reports tonight, Diane, that they may refund some of that money to investors who lossed in the early glitches on the NASDAQ.
NEUT33|They're trying to do some damage control, but at the end of the day, what does this say about fairness?
NEUT34|In America, and what more than half of Americans are in the market, right?
NEUT35|Well, it's interesting.
NEUT36|You know, they call it the retail roadshow.
NEUT37|When a company like Facebook and its bankers lead up to an IPO, they save the juiciest information for these big investment banks.
NEUT38|Whereas in Europe, for example, company goes public, they have to share that with everyone.
NEUT39|That could be an easy fix right there.
BULL40|But it's still a heavy lift to go up against those.
NEUT41|Well, money.
NEUT42|Big guns on Wall Street opened a lot of eyes but happen.
BULL43|"Thanks, bill."""
