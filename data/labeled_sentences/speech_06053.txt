NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to the Moneymaker channel.
NEUT2|My name is Avi and I want to do a quick technical analysis of a stock that we've talked about already on this channel.
BULL3|Solo S Olo Electro mechanic a so the stock is up today.
BULL4|17.3% Amazing Amazing run today and for a while the stock was really really consolidating around the six area right.
NEUT5|We had a big big run when the whole EV craze was going on.
NEUT6|And then the stock just went down all the the pump went all the way down and it's been consolidating for awhile and there's no real big news except that we broke this technical area right?
NEUT7|And if we zoom in one second you can see here that we're currently at 8:49.
NEUT8|So if we pull the fibo Nachi you can see here that the next area would be 867 if we can break the 867 I can see here as going to the 961 area in the 10/5 four area, so this is a very very important to see if we're able to break this 867 area today.
NEUT9|Or is it going to act as their resistance and we're not going to be able to break this area.
NEUT10|Another thing we can see is that the if we look at the indicators right, the RSI is a very good place.
NEUT11|The Mac D, The blue just got over the L. So that's amazing, right?
NEUT12|See how many Reds we had here.
NEUT13|The blue was under the yellow, the Blues under the yellow and now finally the blue is over the yellow.
BULL14|We got a green bar here, so this is a very very, very important indicator and this could make the stock continue to go up.
NEUT15|This could be a very very big run and stastical is the purple is over the red so that's always amazing.

NEUT24|Guys look how the Fibbonaci acted as resistance 123 times amazing amazing the 867 and you saw you saw at the beginning how I pulled it.

NEUT34|An guys solo is a penny stock still, so if you're going to go in not with a position over.
NEUT35|2% actually this is a little larger cap, but it's still under $1 billion, so I would be careful to 3% Max 'cause it's a little bit larger cap.
NEUT36|It's not like the penny stocks we usually talk about.
NEUT37|I hope to see you next time.
