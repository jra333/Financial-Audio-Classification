NEUT3|Just will help my channel gets recommended now.
NEUT4|Let's take a look at bears Q3 numbers, Barricks reported record free cash flow of 1.3 billion.
BULL5|That's increase of 151% compared to Q2 total gold production in Q3 is about 1.2 million.
NEUT6|Also goal and Â£103 million of copper.
NEUT7|That translate to total revenue of 3.5 billion.
NEUT8|The realize goal price was at 1926, all in sustaining costs for gold in Q3 is 1036.
BEAR9|That's decrease of eight point 3% compared to Q2 and copper, all in sustaining costs.
BULL10|$2.31 does increase of 7.4% compared to previous quarter.
NEUT11|Now let's break down their production profile by jurisdictions.
NEUT12|As mentioned earlier, total gold production for Q3 is 1.2 million ounces.
NEUT13|Novella joint venture mines in the USA accounted for 500 and 38,000 ounces of gold.
NEUT14|That's equals 247% of total gold production for Berwick in Q3.
NEUT15|As you may know, that Bear has significant exposure to Africa, their African continents.
NEUT16|Production number is 389 thousand ounce of gold in Q3.
NEUT17|That's 33% of total gold production.
NEUT18|Dominican Republic, accounting for 129 thousand.
NEUT19|Also, gold produced in Q3, that's 11% of total gold production.
NEUT20|Argentina mine accounted for 4% of total gold production and Canada accounted for 5%.
NEUT21|Gold revenue accounted for 91% of total revenue for Q3, and copper revenue accounted for six percent.
NEUT22|3% is from other metals.
NEUT23|Now let's take a look at their balance sheet.
BULL24|They have about 4.7 billion cash on hand and five point 1 billion in debt, so their balance sheet is looking very good with net debt of only 420,000,000.
BULL25|Barack also increased dividend by 12.5% to $0.09 per quarter.
NEUT26|A current stock price.
NEUT27|Dividend yield is around 1%.
NEUT28|Now let's talk a little bit about their operation in PNG as their money lease permit was rejected by PNG government.
BULL29|Barack is currently negotiating with PNG government to have their money permit to be reinstated.
NEUT30|The CEO mentioned during their Q3 conference called that they should expect to reach a new deal with PNG.
BULL31|The New deal would be include equitable sharing of economic benefits and PNG will have a major share of equity under the new arrangement.
NEUT32|Emberek is retaining the operator status.
BEAR33|There, Tony Tony guidance in PNG has been withdrawn as the mine was put into care and maintenance since April.
NEUT34|Lastly, I just want to touch on Berkshire Hathaway's Q3 filings because, as you may know, that Warren Buffett's portfolio has acquired 21 million shares in Berwick in Q2.
BEAR35|However, in Q3 they reduced barracks position to more than 42%.
NEUT36|Current Berkshire Hathaway's holding is about 12 million shares of Barrick as of Q3 filings.
NEUT37|So yeah, does it.
