NEUT0|"""Is the old Selin may adage coming true?"
BEAR1|Should investors be clearing out of the market?
BULL2|Well Matt, it certainly feels like we're seeing a repeat of what we saw in 2010 and 2011 of Big first quarter for the market.
NEUT3|Some chopping this after that.
BEAR4|And then you know some weakness in the summer as the European issues flare up.
NEUT5|We just had these elections in Greece and France.
BEAR6|The concern is that this austerity deal that was cut in Europe could see some turbulence because new governments don't necessarily subscribe to the same views as the ones that they are replacing.
BULL7|You know yesterday we had a fine market.
NEUT8|There was no no real reaction to it other than the morning.
BEAR9|Today we're really getting hammered in the market as people seem to really starting to come to grips with.
NEUT10|Maybe we're going to have to reconsider the question of will Greece leaves the euro?
NEUT11|And what does that mean for Europe?
BEAR12|There's really no safe haven today.
NEUT13|If you look at gold, which a lot of people have treated as a safe haven over the past few years.
BEAR14|Not working out today, gold down more than $40 as we shoot this.
BEAR15|You know the stock market down 1% people are certainly flying to the safety of the dollar and US Treasurys.
NEUT16|But as we know you know.
BEAR17|There's a zero bound on US Treasurys, and we're at 183, so I don't know how much lower that's really going to.
NEUT18|What are the bright spots?
NEUT19|What can actually make this summer better summer for stocks than last year?
NEUT20|Well, Madam, might be awhile before we start to see some of those positive catalysts, which is why we might have this choppiness, at least for another month or so.
BULL21|We're into this summer a good U.S. jobs report would certainly help matters.
NEUT22|We didn't get one for April.
NEUT23|Maybe we get one from May, but that's a few weeks down the road.
BULL24|Still first quarter earnings season was strong at this point.
BULL25|More than 420 companies out of the S&P 500 have reported earnings.
BULL26|The number of beats versus expectations is more than 65%, I believe.
BULL27|Today the number was 66%.
BULL28|Those are good things first quarter, and it's pretty good.
NEUT29|But again, it's going to be another couple of, you know, another month.
NEUT30|Plus before we start to get results from the first quarter, and I don't know if the market can sort of keep up until we get there, so it's going to be a real test if we continue to see this turmoil out of Europe, it's going to be a challenge for the US market to sort of overcome that without any of these positive catalyst that you might get from some of the earnings like we saw with, you know.
BULL31|Caterpillar and Apple and other companies reported decent numbers, I guess, as always, it's it's a stock pickers market and we'll wait and see.
NEUT32|Well, it certainly is, and one of the things that you can look at is where are you going to get paid to take?
NEUT33|Whether it's to take a little risk or to keep your money going into cash at this point.
NEUT34|While it might sound like a great way to protect yourself, not so great if the dollar takes a continues to take a beating so you know, look at dividend stocks.
NEUT35|Look at where you can get some total return.
NEUT36|I was at a conference this morning and we talked about.
BEAR37|You know there are certainly some aspects of the dividend market that are getting a little.
BULL38|Overpriced, but there's opportunities healthcare telecoms.
NEUT39|Still some areas of people like 18 team Verizon.
BEAR40|"Two of the stocks that are actually showing slim gains today with the rest of the market down big."""
