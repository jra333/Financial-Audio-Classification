NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, a very interesting set up here headed into Friday and the weekend.
NEUT6|As you know, a lot of the market was recovering in Amazon really wasn't participating at all.
BULL7|In fact, it kind of just chopped around sideways and in doing so, like I said, has set up a couple of very key levels.
NEUT8|And the first level and I should take a step back.
NEUT9|Neither of these areas are.
NEUT10|Am I trying to come across this is a great discovery on my part or that I have some sort of special skill to be pointing this out.
NEUT11|I sure you people that use charts understand charts are going to be watching these levels on the chart and a lot of people.
NEUT12|Are watching the same level and wondering the same thing called.
NEUT13|You know self filling prophecy caught whatever you want.
NEUT14|It can produce some very dynamic movements in the first level that you're going to have all sorts of people Longton shorts and everybody in between.
NEUT15|Watching is 3040 thirty 40 to give credit where credits do did a very good job of holding that support today.
NEUT16|But my point here is that nothing is guaranteed, but it is a more than valid and more than rational thoughts.
BEAR17|Have that if the price does breakdown through that 3040 mark, that could very well end of itself create quite a bit of additional downside selling pressure.
NEUT18|In my opinion, I don't think anybody would really be shocked to see this happen with a high volume break of 3040.
BULL19|Having the price go down to at minimum the 3020 Mark, so 3040 thirty 22 very important levels of support moving forward.
NEUT20|On the flip side of things, the level that a lot of breakout players going to be watching wondering about is that pink line there, which in my chart denotes a very well known, the very famous 200.
NEUT21|Moving average and that's currently valued at well.
NEUT22|Just call it the 3075 Mark.
NEUT23|So if there is any sort of attempted movements back to the upside and the price and get up through 3075 again, no guarantees, but that's a valid.
NEUT24|That's a rational thought to have.
BEAR25|That breaking that area could create some additional upside buying pressure, so moving forward those would be the main areas to watch on Amazon.
NEUT26|So let's see how this one closes out the week on Friday 1st off.
BULL27|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT36|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT37|That is again totally live.
