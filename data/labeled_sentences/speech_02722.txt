BEAR0|"""What's up everyone Davis here that was a wait to get paid open man."
NEUT1|Usually I'm in and out pretty consistently within the 1st 5 minutes, not today.
NEUT2|Here's what happened.
BEAR3|We opened up and we were below a level that I wanted to go with this red line right here.
NEUT4|Volume weighted, average press.
BULL5|And it's yes, it's shot a tiny bit above it.
NEUT6|If I bought on this break I would have been buying right into resistance.
BULL7|So Pivot point factored in from previous days.
NEUT8|Price action to support and resistance levels.
NEUT9|In this case resistance.
BULL10|And pre market resistance from this morning after hours resistance from yesterday too.
NEUT11|So I simply passed on that opportunity saying this isn't really backed by enough volume and I'm buying right into debatably a selling point.
BEAR12|So I let this candle play out and it wound up closing below its volume weighted average price quickly to reject it upon the next 5 minute candle where I did buy puts slow steady decrease and I got out for a little over $1000 during this scandal.
NEUT13|This is like I said, a wait to get paid scenario because typically I'm going to jump in and out in the first five minutes today.
NEUT14|That simply did not make sense.
NEUT15|All I needed to see that was a chart volume and that was enough for me to say I can certainly live without taking this chance right here because Simply put the reward to risk was not on the reward side in my opinion.
NEUT16|I'm glad I passed on it too little bit of patience can pay.
NEUT17|This is a good example.
NEUT18|I am completely honest with you.
NEUT19|I'm very used to being in and out within the 1st 5 minutes.
NEUT20|Certainly not.
BULL21|Today that was just not the best 5 minute candle in the world, but it wound up shaping into a good pattern for a quick buying to open put option move followed by selling clothes.
NEUT22|The SPY January 13375 puts a right at the money to miles expiration.
NEUT23|That's what I went with, nice and on.
NEUT24|But remember what I said.
NEUT25|Sometimes you gotta wait a little bit to get paid, even if it's only 5 minutes.
BULL26|Hope this video has helped you have a good one.
NEUT27|"Ladies and gentlemen."""
