NEUT0|"""Hey Melissa, what we all know teens love their food."
NEUT1|Piper Sandler is out today with its latest taking stock with teens spring report surveying 7000 teens nationwide with an average age of 16.1 years old.
NEUT2|No surprise here.
NEUT3|Food is teens number one priority overall for the wallet at 23% of wallet share for males.
NEUT4|If the top priority for females it's number two behind only clothing and accessories.
NEUT5|The top brands for both upper income and average income teens are Chick-fil-A, Starbucks and Chipotle.
BULL6|The survey says that Chipotle is holding steady with brand scores and gaining a lot of traction with average income teens that could be thanks in part to its marketing awareness.
NEUT7|Campaigns on places like Tick Tock, it's merchandise lines.
BEAR8|An more Starbucks is the most preferred coffee company, but its mindshare is muted from prior highs.
BEAR9|Piper Sandler says its brand equity is relevant social currency among Gen Z. McDonald's is still in the top five brands for both upper and average income teens, but its mindshare also dipped.
BEAR10|This could shift, though, as the company is lean.
NEUT11|Into digital engagement and of course, as those celebrity partnerships with Travis Scott and J. Balvin.
NEUT12|Overall, teens overwhelmingly prefer limited service brands to full service brands that offer social experience but also have that affordability factor.
NEUT13|Teens are also a part of the reopening trade, 69% of them plan to take the vaccine.
BULL14|That's up from 64% in the fall 81%.
NEUT15|Melissa say they plan to dine in.
BULL16|That's up from 77% in the fall.
BULL17|Piper Sandler projects that restaurant spending is going to rebound as both mobility and spending patterns return to normal.
NEUT18|Back over to you K. You know it's interesting as Chick-fil-A is a top spot and a lot of these brands spend a lot of Money Marketing to these teens, but Chick-fil-A does not.
NEUT19|So how did that all happen?
NEUT20|You know Chick-fil-A has a lot of brand awareness.
NEUT21|The chicken is really, really popular.
NEUT22|They'll get into, you, know these little tips here and there on Twitter.
NEUT23|They do market, but they don't do these big celebrity partnerships like we see from McDonald's or these Tick Tock viral campaigns like we see from Chipotle Big Shift from when I was a team.
NEUT24|We just hang out at Chili's.
NEUT25|It was all about casual dining.
NEUT26|All these quick service and fast food companies are really, really hot right now.
BULL27|Alright, Kate, thanks Kate Rogers.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
