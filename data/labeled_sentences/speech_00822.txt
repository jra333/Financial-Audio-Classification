NEUT17|What is going on with this stock?
NEUT18|So one thing is need to understand is that the main reason why this stock went up today is because of Vanguard actually purchase a little bit over 2.6 million shares.
NEUT19|OK, it is absolutely insane when they bought this and I'm not talking to you guys and you guys can see it.
NEUT20|It was like around $0.67.
NEUT21|OK, this was Friday.
NEUT22|Yes, and see that it was at $0.65.
NEUT23|Nothing happened, right?
NEUT24|And it wasn't until you know today you guys can see this huge growth, you know.
NEUT25|And most of the reason why this stock went up is because people found out about this.
NEUT26|You know Vanguard wow you know they bought a penny stock and they bought so much of it, right?
NEUT27|That's the reason why a lot of people today were also day trading.
NEUT28|This OK, when a lot of people I believe it had over 220,000,000 in volume.
NEUT29|OK, that is insane.
NEUT30|Usually I only see like you know, fifty million 100,000,000, but double like 220,000,000 people.
NEUT31|You know you know also day trading.
NEUT32|This is absolutely insane.
