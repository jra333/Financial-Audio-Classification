NEUT1|A lot of stocks are similar on the one week time frame we considered it was four point, 20% up or the one month time frame.
BULL2|It was overall wins.
NEUT3|A lot of people did not want to miss this opportunity to subscribe because I told you guys to buy right here.
BULL4|So overall I do believe that on the next week it will continue to go up.
NEUT5|We could see some little dip right here.
NEUT6|But yeah, I do it for the long term.
NEUT7|Of course I'm holding it for like 2-3 four years.
NEUT8|This is easily surpassing the OR this the highest point $3 to like one in 1/2 year, maybe, maybe a little sooner, but we will see, so let me know what you think about sundale growers.
