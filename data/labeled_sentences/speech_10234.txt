BULL0|"""While that ease of deals enough to keep the Bush balls in the air today, I don't think if we don't get something and come Monday, well, I do expect a sell off."
NEUT1|It doesn't help that this markets gotten very overbought, the most overbought it's been this year using my the S&P oscillator that I pay for its come up too far too fast and we are due for a pullback historically so if something doesn't develop here well then I can see us going down while someone that we might find out what's really going on between AMD and Xilinx, I like silence, they've got great chips for this data center, autos defense telco, or areas that AMD needs more exposure to if they want to take things to the next level, but I didn't think Xilinx was for sale.
NEUT2|Remember, we had him well not that long ago and I worry the price will already be too high for AMD, but.
NEUT3|Doctor Lisa Su knows what she's doing, and if Xilinx wants to play hardball, I think she'll walk away.
NEUT4|It's an interesting catch 22.
BULL5|AMD could really benefit from this takeover, which we give a much more, much larger Tam total adjustable market.
NEUT6|But it only makes sense if they can get Xilinx for the right price, and it may be out of reach.
BULL7|Either way, I've got total faith and Lisa Su's leadership remember.
NEUT8|After discussing with her where the stock was at $5, I came to you and said by it she knows what she's doing not only with the stock price of the stock and she's an engineer.
NEUT9|She knows what to do with the greatest chips.
NEUT10|If she decides to acquire Xilinx.
NEUT11|And AMD sells off.
