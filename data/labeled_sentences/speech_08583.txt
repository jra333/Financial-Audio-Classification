NEUT0|"""Hey guys, this is a quick 62nd video about what is the mix squeeze or the margin call squeeze and how do you get margin called as a hedge fund if you can't pay for your house over here like like over here like Sarah says and you have to sell all your furniture, try and cover it."
NEUT1|Is this what the margin call squeezes almost essentially what the margin calls squeezes is when you have bought your house let's say and your mortgage continues to rise because the value of your house continues to rise.
NEUT2|Let's imagine that world.
NEUT3|That you, your house is worth $1,000,000 and you have to pay a certain amount of mortgage.
NEUT4|Maybe you can only afford $5000 but as the house rises to like $2,000,000 now you have a $10,000 mortgage and you can't afford it.
NEUT5|So you have to start selling your furniture.
NEUT6|This is essentially what's happening with the hedge funds getting screwed over as GameStop in AMC gets higher and higher.
NEUT7|However, as you sell your furniture, all their family members also sit on that couch and drink from your Britta filter.
NEUT8|And you are screwing up everyone else, and those are the retirement funds that you are likely going to see tank when the hedge funds take their assets and stocks out, exit their positions.
NEUT9|"If you want to see more like this video and share it with other fellow Moon platoon apes and I'll see you in the money."""
