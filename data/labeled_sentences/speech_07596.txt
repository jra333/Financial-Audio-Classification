BULL0|"""We sold it from 160 to 200 or something like a nice tidy profit."
BULL1|We made it.
NEUT2|We made about 3 1/2 billion dollars of $500 million investment.
NEUT3|As it turned out I still sold it way too.
BEAR4|So since I sold it they must have shot.
NEUT5|Got off and said my Warren sold out.
NEUT6|So I'm gonna let it go up.
NEUT7|Yeah you left money on the table a lot of money dummy exactly right.
NEUT8|Bunker would say that Charlie was Charlie.
NEUT9|Would say you've done it again but you can't keep always trying for the average person who's maybe never bought a stock before.
NEUT10|What's your advice about that?
NEUT11|You can't constantly sit there and wait and say oh, it's going to hire someone to hide.
NEUT12|We don't even think about that.
NEUT13|What we think about is how much is it selling for?
NEUT14|How much do we think it's worth?
NEUT15|When we bought it at 35 billion effectively?
NEUT16|About the company was probably worth at least 100 billion.
NEUT17|How did it come to your attention?
NEUT18|How do you find a stuff like Petro China?
NEUT19|I sit there in my office and I read an annual report which Fortunately was in English and it described a very good company and told about the oil reserves told about the refining, talk about the chemicals, everything else, and I sat there and read it, and I thought to myself, this company is worth about 100 billion now.
NEUT20|I didn't look at the price first.
NEUT21|I look at the business 1st and try and figure out what it's worth.
NEUT22|Because if I look at the price first, I'll get influenced by that.
NEUT23|So I look at that look at the company 1st.
NEUT24|I try to value and then I look at the price and if the price is way less than what I've just value that I'm going to buy it.
NEUT25|How do you value it?
NEUT26|Well I that's that's the trick, but it's essentially what I would pay for the whole business if I could buy it.
NEUT27|And when we sold the company stock it was valued, will say it seven, probably 250 to 275 billion.
NEUT28|And we thought that was a fair price.
BULL29|Now oil had gone up from $30 a barrel.
NEUT30|The $75 barrel.
BULL31|Now it's up even further.
BULL32|But today well yesterday it anyway, I believe Petro China is the second most highly valued company in the world higher than the next Exxon Mobil.
NEUT33|Next Texans.
NEUT34|Have you sold the entire stake?
NEUT35|Yeah, I wish I had, but I have as of when well we sold over.
NEUT36|That's all that much time went down alot.
NEUT37|We buy it back.
NEUT38|Would you ever buy or sell stock based on?
NEUT39|Political pressure, or sort of somebody people being upset about Darfur had nothing to do with why you sold this stock.
NEUT40|The Chinese government owns 88% of Pepper China.
NEUT41|They also own control of 29 out of the 30 largest companies in China.
NEUT42|The Chinese government is the one that has a position in relation to the Sudan and they have it.
NEUT43|If you own any one of the 30 largest companies in publicly traded companies in China.
NEUT44|You will have the Chinese government is your majority partner and the question is are you responsible for their actions?
NEUT45|You're going to China next week for a ribbon cutting ceremony for his car.
NEUT46|One is sort of the limit of my abilities lives.
NEUT47|That's what they use is.
NEUT48|You're pretty good at cutting with.
NEUT49|I've gotten used to it.
NEUT50|You are you looking at other companies in China?
NEUT51|I don't.
NEUT52|I don't look based.
NEUT53|No.
NEUT54|The answer is pretty much no, but I don't look based on on countries or that sort of thing.
NEUT55|I just I just read every report I can and I try and figure out whether something is cheap.
NEUT56|But how would you find a report like Petro China?
NEUT57|Four years ago this is not a name that maybe.
NEUT58|That that a lot of people with other guys read *******.
NEUT59|"Reports."""
