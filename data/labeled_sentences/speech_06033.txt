NEUT0|"""He is calling this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|I should also know from disclosure standpoint, I do own Amazon from the long side in my retirement account, so just keep that in mind as they go through the analysis here.
BULL5|But to build context very very impressive movement, mainly because of that final 30 minutes right there.
NEUT6|Big huge green candle, big volume.
NEUT7|So an when you stop to think about the fact that the price at one point was down here and then all of a sudden surge to be all the way up there.
NEUT8|Very nice move, but that does little more than valid question of.
NEUT9|But is there any sort of true power behind this price woman?
NEUT10|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead Cat Bounce type move?
NEUT12|And I have no idea.
NEUT13|But by using charge we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves around this area right here at the 2920 Mark Wise 2920 important this was going to happen, but if the price were to come down in 2920, behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT14|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT15|Well, from a very literal point of view that we put in the price quite literally right back inside of that range that it just broke out from and not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT16|But price movements like go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, choose strength or anything like that.
NEUT17|Now.
NEUT18|On the flip side, 'cause.
NEUT19|We fear nothing.
NEUT20|Go straight up.
NEUT21|So maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner and then starts to work its way back upwards.
NEUT22|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there you have these loads down there.
NEUT23|If you envision each one of those astera steps, well hey there you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT25|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL26|It's going to make progress forward and in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined as 2920 in regards to levels of resistance, all is going to be watching that purple line up there very closely.
NEUT27|The very well known, the very famous 50.
NEUT28|Moving average.
NEUT29|Current value of that right up there around.
NEUT30|Let's just call it 2990, so keep a close eye on that.
NEUT31|But anyway, look at it.
BULL32|Very impressive movement.
BULL33|Very impressive.
NEUT34|Final 30 minutes.
BULL35|So let's see if the price can continue to build on this momentum as the days play out.
NEUT36|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT38|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL39|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
