BULL0|"""Good to have you this morning."
NEUT1|I mean, you heard the conversation Andrew, let's start there.
NEUT2|I mean, what are your expectations in terms of the pace of returns in terms of what an investor ought to do in terms of tilting one way or the other.
BEAR3|At this point, we've obviously seen this massive run in value stocks along with the rise in yields.
NEUT4|Yeah, I mean I look.
NEUT5|I think what you said is that all right Michael, which is in second year of a bull market is just.
BEAR6|It's a little tougher than the first year.
NEUT7|There's a little bit more volatility and volatility can be used for to your advantage to invest in to be patient, waiting for bigger pullbacks.
NEUT8|Then you get first year, but it tends to be a pretty good year.
NEUT9|I think.
BULL10|Value has done very well here and growth is pretty oversold so I think we're getting a bounce in growth stocks.
BULL11|But in my opinion that's an opportunity to.
BEAR12|Reload on value names because I think a Fed Chairman Powell's been pretty unequivocal.
BEAR13|It's all about the unemployment rate getting unemployment rate down.
NEUT14|So I think rates are moving higher and you know, coming out of recession, you tend to want to own value cyclical stocks.
BULL15|And they're doing exactly what they normally do coming out of recession, they outperform.
NEUT16|And so I think that is not over yet.
NEUT17|What about Andrew?
NEUT18|The idea that you're starting to hear a little more out there that values become momentum.
NEUT19|It's become a little bit of a consensus trade and therefore.
NEUT20|It's no longer, you know, early in that move.
NEUT21|No, if you look it's not.
NEUT22|I mean it value stocks got very very cheap in recession.
NEUT23|They've repriced about halfway back to normalized, you know, levels of cheapness, but we're not there yet.
NEUT24|So yeah, the big the fat pitch was earlier, but I I don't think it's too late.
BEAR25|And I think a lot of people want rates to stop going up because they're overweight in growth stocks.
NEUT26|I think there's a lot of talk about liking financials, but I don't think as many people are.
NEUT27|Overweight financials as like it then, because I think they they, you know growth spend the winter.
NEUT28|So that's going to clearly have a higher weighting peoples portfolio.
NEUT29|Michael Dirait stop going up from here, at least in the near term.
NEUT30|I mean, we can have the conversation about Treasurys being oversold.
NEUT31|What do you think?
NEUT32|Well, first of all, I agree with what Mike said about his term super oversold.
BULL33|I think that's a great way to say do rates go up.
BULL34|I think their rates are going to moderate.
BEAR35|I think that right now you're seeing a reaction because of uncertainty.
NEUT36|What's going to happen with stimulus?
NEUT37|How much is going to juicy economy?
BEAR38|But we're still targeting the 10 year yield of being around 1.6 at the end of the year, so I think they're probably going to drop a little bit from where they are now.
NEUT39|And I think that for an investment.
NEUT40|From an investment standpoint, if you're rotating out of stocks and I agree with what was just said regarding value stocks, dividend stocks that they make a lot of sense.
NEUT41|But if you're rotating out of equities and you're moving to bonds because what else is there, I guess you could well crypto and go cash, and you're going to bond.
NEUT42|You don't have to necessarily go to act, you don't have to go to long duration fixed income something with a 5 duration.
NEUT43|You can maybe hedge a little better.
NEUT44|Maybe you go to three year duration.
NEUT45|Maybe you go to 3 1/2 year duration.
NEUT46|So that way you don't have as much risk if what I've just said is incorrect that.
NEUT47|Rates in fact do go up if they don't go up then at least you participated pulling out some of the equity risk in getting higher yields that in money market.
BULL48|So I still think there's a constructive way to invest in fixed income for diversified investment strategy.
NEUT49|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT50|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
