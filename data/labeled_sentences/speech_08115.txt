NEUT0|"""So tide into this is another question that we got, which is what determines a company share price."
NEUT1|So a lot of the things that we actually mentioned as factors in whether or not a company can stay listed in the S&P also contribute to share price.
NEUT2|So I this is how I see it a share price is ultimately going to be reflective of a company's internal fundamentals as well as what the market as a whole thinks of the company's chance of success in the context of the global economy.
NEUT3|It's kind of a lot, but to break that down, to break that down a little bit, no, no go for it.
NEUT4|Go for it.
NEUT5|No, no, it's it's all you, John all you got I'll take that yeah I mean so I mean and you know you think about what we're seeing right now, right?
NEUT6|So we're on the on the back end.
NEUT7|Have a really really long bull market right where at the beginning of this stocks, it didn't matter if you were PNG, which is an excellent company, right?
NEUT8|Coca Cola, which in excellent company Wal-Mart.
NEUT9|Amazon you or your 3D printer didn't matter what you were.
NEUT10|All stocks were hit in 2008 and 2009 right?
BULL11|And then out of that you saw stock prices of certain companies, you know, come back up much more quickly and those were your solid companies that were improving much, much more much more quickly.
NEUT12|And then as this you know everything gained momentum.
NEUT13|Then you had, you know, those more speculative stocks really start to pick up because people are feeling more optimistic about things.
NEUT14|They're thinking that everything is turning around the corner.
NEUT15|There were three four years into a bull market, and it's at that point where everybody like wants to start pouring their money in right, which is kind of ironic.
NEUT16|You doubted me, but yeah, so you have both.
NEUT17|You know that underlying market stuff that's going on.
NEUT18|And now we have the concerns in China we have the oil prices and ISIS and whatever else.
NEUT19|You know what I mean, right?
NEUT20|Going on economy and then.
NEUT21|So you have those things that are bringing it down now.
NEUT22|But then, as to Gabby's point, you also have and this is one of the things that we really preach at The Motley Fool.
NEUT23|Ultimately, it all comes down to the fundamentals of any company, because they really good company will survive through a full cycle.
NEUT24|Whether it's good or bad or whatever, it is right.
BEAR25|There are some companies that are down right now.
BEAR26|Just because the market in general is down, but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're bad market.
NEUT27|Heck, Berkshire Hathaway is down right now like it, but that doesn't.
BULL28|Berkshire Hathaway has an outstanding track record, and its fundamentals are strong like just because it's down right now doesn't mean that.
NEUT29|There's anything inherently wrong with it, but for an example of a company that is down based, kind of like on what, besides Berkshire Hathaway beside based on what is going on in the global economy, is something that you could look at Chevron.
NEUT30|They have a lot of exposure to energy, obviously brightly, just a little bit of exposure to their own company.
NEUT31|And I don't know if you've noticed.
NEUT32|Gas is super cheap right now.
BEAR33|That's not great for oil companies.
NEUT34|It's not.
NEUT35|But let me tell you something and Gabby and I talked about this beforehand.
NEUT36|There is an oil talk that I can't talk about because I want to buy another trading restrictions.
NEUT37|But you know, you talked to your really big investors right now, and I'm not one of them.
NEUT38|I'm kind of amused by investor, but I listen to what they say.
BULL39|Oil is a great opportunity right now.
NEUT40|"At least, that's certainly what it looks like looks like to, you know, a lot of investors looks like that to me too."""
