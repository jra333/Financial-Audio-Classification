BULL0|"""Investors grabbing up Grubhub shares the delivery service soaring as much as 17% today on reports its hired financial advisors for a possible sale."
BEAR1|Other stocks that are sort of around that space, Uber with Uber, eats Yelp.
NEUT2|They review restaurants also rallying on this report.
NEUT3|Dan do you think there could be much more to this story?
NEUT4|There was a time last year when VC was investing in this in private markets and they really love this whole theme.
NEUT5|They like it much less now.
BEAR6|They don't like it.
NEUT7|It's part of Uber either.
NEUT8|So I'm not really sure about what sort of scenarios I've been given a whole heck of a lot of thought where you put some combinations together and the two pieces together are worth more than what they are right now.
BEAR9|We've seen a lot of money just lit on fire in the last 24 months, trying to do exactly what these guys do, and I think the Peter Croft decline that we saw over the last year.
BEAR10|And Grubhub tells you that there's a lot of competition sales growth for this company has just ground to a halt.
NEUT11|It's going to be maybe 12% this year, 12% next.
NEUT12|So I'm not certain.
NEUT13|I don't think you go out and buy it because they might get sold.
NEUT14|I tend to agree.
NEUT15|I think this is the area where you sell the stock.
BEAR16|He just went 30 to 60 over the last couple of months you had what looked like capitule to volume today, 20 million shares.
NEUT17|I think that's a good enough reason to let it go here.
NEUT18|You're right back at the 200 again.
NEUT19|We fail here before things in Downtrends should be sold at the 200.
NEUT20|I think Grubhub is the epitome of that any other player.
NEUT21|Do you buy an Uber on this news guy?
NEUT22|Because if Grubhub sells itself, or maybe you know changes its model and you got Uber eats sitting out there.
NEUT23|Does that make it look more attractive?
NEUT24|No, I don't think for Uber.
NEUT25|I mean, I'll stay long lift.
BULL26|I think it's a name that will continue to prove itself.
BULL27|I mean, the quarters have been good and they have a pathway to profitability.
NEUT28|We've talked about that.
BULL29|I pushed back a little bit here on Grubhub.
BEAR30|I mean, if you go back in November, weeks broke down from 59 in a meaningful way.
NEUT31|I mean, I know that's not that far from here, but that's another 8%.
BULL32|So I do think this further upside.
BEAR33|I think these things tend to overshoot to the downside.
NEUT34|And in this case, I think it'll overshoot to the upside down and back to these IPO's that around a bit.
NEUT35|I mean, in Uber's case, I don't think there's an invisible sun on this one.
BEAR36|I think you actually have a case where there's been a lot of bad news for this company, an although we said it's going to get better and it's too complicated.
NEUT37|Maybe the best Uber eats, and now they have to become.
NEUT38|Jim Cramer had a great tweet on Newbury.
NEUT39|Basically had a picture of Uber eats and he said sell this stupid business at that was his word and the stock.
BULL40|I think he agrees.
NEUT41|There's no synchronicity, but if you wish to hear, I mean we've been talking about that thematically.
NEUT42|The lift versus Uber, I mean.
NEUT43|You know VC's were just pouring money into Uber.
NEUT44|They wanted more geographies.
NEUT45|They wanted more businesses.
NEUT46|They wanted more.
NEUT47|Everything they did was magic it well.
NEUT48|But but the point is, public investors would love to see a more focused business.
NEUT49|And that's one of the reasons why.
NEUT50|What are you doing?
NEUT51|It's all police lyrics.
NEUT52|The band police.
NEUT53|If you have missed it.
NEUT54|Yeah, I'm in synchronously on this one.
NEUT55|Are you OK?
NEUT56|I'm sorry I didn't know if you weren't playing the game with us.
BULL57|OK, well The upshot.
NEUT58|"My point, we're having tea in the Sahara."""
