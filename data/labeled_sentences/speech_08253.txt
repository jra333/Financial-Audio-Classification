NEUT0|"""Should you stick with these big safe plays, or are there better bets for your money?"
NEUT1|Our next guest has a few different ideas.
NEUT2|Seed Grasso is director of institutional sales that Stuart Frankel, Anna CNBC fast money trader, so it's good to have you.
NEUT3|First of all, would you disagree with anything that Rebecca just said, or is this just a way for people who want like she said, that's the play?
NEUT4|If you're looking for kind of safety, what's the play?
NEUT5|If you want maybe a little bit more upside, where would you go?
NEUT6|So first of all, big fan of Rebecca.
NEUT7|She's been right for a very long time, but I think Kelly what people have made the mistake of is thinking that large cap tech is safety.
BULL8|So if you look it through the prism of off the March low I WM's are up 93% small cap Russell up 93% off that low currently right now.
NEUT9|If you look at triple cues.
BULL10|Technology, it's up 78% off the March low so if you change that dynamic and say well everything ran OK so let's look at.
NEUT11|From October 1st.
BEAR12|Apple is actually down from October 1st this year and if you look at Trinseo a name that I picked for awhile, not CSE, that's up 62%.
BULL13|If you look at GE deep value, that's up 80% from October 1st.
NEUT14|If you look at Microsoft that's flat from October 1st so.
NEUT15|I would say those six names that you talk about all time on your show.
NEUT16|That's the old guard people are going to change habits.
NEUT17|It's gonna take him a long time to change habits on those names, right?
NEUT18|So look at look at the value place GE, TSC, WRK, Westrock names that you don't talk about Olin OLN.
NEUT19|These are names that are going to be the new guard.
NEUT20|These are the value names.
NEUT21|These are the deep value names, but old habits die very hard.
NEUT22|But we're just a blip here.
BULL23|When Rebecca talked about low low rates, the 10 year is up on a percentage basis, over 70% since August.
NEUT24|That requires you to make changes in your portfolio that requires you to buy value.
NEUT25|Nifty little wanna buy value in a rising rate.
NEUT26|I take your point and I think a lot of people you know are making that argument and are certainly sympathetic to it, certainly.
NEUT27|But let me ask about the rest of the portfolio of names that I have here.
NEUT28|Quickly.
NEUT29|You have Capri Holdings.
NEUT30|You have Sonos in Virgin Galactic and Virgin Galactic is not exactly a deep value stock.
NEUT31|No, so you have to round out your portfolio.
NEUT32|Rebecca talked about a two diversification, so so my main Pixar GE Capri Holdings, Trinseo, Olin.
NEUT33|And then I got around it out.
NEUT34|Sonos is a hidden value slash growth play.
BULL35|That one I expect to be much higher in short order and Virgin Galactic.
NEUT36|That's my moon shot Kelly.
NEUT37|I think the world that's going to be the next frontier, not the final.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
