BEAR0|"""Susan Lee Facebook was season, so we're going to call a miss on profit here if we're looking at 80."
BEAR1|From what I see, $0.88 the calls for dollars 63, which is down from the earnings and profit of year over year.
NEUT2|So from 2018 beats on revenues of 15.8 billion.
NEUT3|We were calling for something close to 1514.98 billion to be exact.
BULL4|And as you see, we're up in the after hours also active users.
NEUT5|This is pretty significant here because monthly active users were looking for something close to 32.37.
BULL6|For we got 2.38 billion for monthly active users daily active users a beat with 1.559 billion.
NEUT7|That was the estimate.
NEUT8|What we got 1.56 billion.
BULL9|So yes, they've continued to grow their platforms and I think that's pretty significant for a social media sites in a company like Facebook.
NEUT10|Guys, yeah, and that number.
NEUT11|I'm sure you think it is Susan that's probably comparable, right?
NEUT12|The $0.88 versus dollars 63 guys 85?
NEUT13|Yeah, $0.85.
NEUT14|That's that's comparable from what we can see right now.
NEUT15|Fair enough.
BEAR16|Yeah, so it's it's a miss on the bottom line because margins have come down a lot.
BULL17|It's 22% from want to see a little bit over 20% compared to 40% a year ago.
NEUT18|And as Facebook has told us, that illustrated to the markets look wanna spend more to monitor our sites to make sure there isn't violent content.
BEAR19|There's no harassment and so we have been expecting this, and that's probably what's hitting their bottom line.
NEUT20|Investors feel like it go ahead just to give you a little color on that Facebook post.
NEUT21|$3 billion in legal expenses related to the FTC matters, so that's a little bit of what you were talking about there.
NEUT22|"And they say that the FTC matter remains unresolved is a quote from their press release OK?"""
