NEUT0|"""Continue all of this discussion with our market guest Keith Lerner, who is true, this advisory chief market strategist, appreciate your being here and I need a kind of sophomoric explanation of some things that confuse a lot of us as investors and that has to do with the 10 year yield and what we're witnessing over the past couple of days."
NEUT1|So in my very basic understanding, and I think this is common when the yield is going up, the people are selling their Holdings of the 10 year.
NEUT2|But if they're selling their Holdings, what are they doing with that money?
NEUT3|They weren't going into equities.
NEUT4|Where's that cash going?
NEUT5|Oh great.
BULL6|First of all, great to be back with you.
NEUT7|We don't exactly know where the money is going.
NEUT8|My guess would be is by going to somewhat of cash because you know equities have had a big run and now you're seeing some money come out of the fixed income market.
NEUT9|I, you know normally that data somewhere delayed, but that's probably the most likely thing that's happening.
NEUT10|And you also think about some of these, like hedge funds, which basically you know they they invest based on on interest rates and volatility.
NEUT11|There's probably some margin calls as well that's happening when you see such a dramatic move so quickly in his leverage in the system.
NEUT12|You know, part of this is just to cover some some margin selling as well or margin calls, I should say.
NEUT13|OK, the question is, will we see a spike like we did earlier this week?
BULL14|An initial spike above 1.6?
BULL15|That's a level we haven't seen in quite some time.
BEAR16|I guess that really puts into question the reason Barbara seeing such a big spike that we have been seeing in yields.
NEUT17|At what point do you think though this place is some pressure on the Fed in order to act?
BULL18|Oh, I think we're getting very close right now.
NEUT19|I mean, it seems like yesterday that seemed a little like, you know, climatic.
BEAR20|You know we had a bad auction.
NEUT21|As far as Treasury bid, some of the algorithms took hold and you saw it so far today and after that spike.
NEUT22|Yesterday we've held well below that, but we're already seeing the ECB come in, you know they're already starting to talk down Hills, and I suspect over the next few weeks, if we see a much more higher moving race, we're going to see the Fed presidents and the Chairman himself, probably.
BULL23|Kind of leaning against this, I don't know that we're quite there yet, but again, I think after the spike yesterday, you know we've seen yields come back in a little bit as well.
NEUT24|OK, but to follow up on all of this.
NEUT25|So we got this potential part of new cash waiting to be deployed and you point out that the economy takes 2 steps forward, one step back that's positive in my book, so shouldn't that money be deployed?
NEUT26|You still even at 1.6% on a 10 year.
NEUT27|You're better off in the markets and in the equity markets, aren't you?
NEUT28|Well, that's how have you?
BEAR29|I mean, we've been overweight equities.
NEUT30|We've been calling this a new bull market since last May.
NEUT31|However, we have to remember that as you mentioned, is really 2 steps forward.
NEUT32|One step back for the stock market as well.
BULL33|We were up 75% since March.
BULL34|That's the strongest start to a bull market in history and and where we are right now.
NEUT35|When we look back at the 1982 market or the 2009 market, that's where things start to get a bit choppier.
NEUT36|So in our view, this is very normal, but we also think when the next phase of the bull market after that initial snapback, that tends to be a choppier, you know overall market, but I will say it when you look out six to 12 months were still positive.
BEAR37|We think the primary trying this positive and we continue to think that the earning side is somewhat underappreciated, but we're having a little bit of a reset and a little bit of a technical correction, and this is very similar to what we saw in 2010 coming out of that bull market as well.
BEAR38|So I want to lose focus that the big trend is higher.
NEUT39|But again, you know we often get some type of gut check in the market, and that's what we're seeing the last couple of days.
BULL40|We appreciate your bringing us up to speed on all this.
NEUT41|It's always good when you are with us and we look forward to your next visit.
NEUT42|Keith Lerner is truest advisory chief market strategist.
BULL43|"Thank you, we."""
