NEUT0|"""No, I think what you're seeing."
NEUT1|Obviously today was a bit of a reversal in this nearer term rotation, but our view is this consolidation has been a rotational move, not a vindication of a big top, or that we're late cycle or anything like that.
BULL2|Tech is just been the source of funding, and I think we're seeing it bounced back a little bit.
NEUT3|I've been thinking a lot with tomorrow is the one year anniversary of the market lows in 2020.
NEUT4|How different your one of a bull market is versus year two.
BULL5|We bounced almost 75% off of the lows.
NEUT6|From late March of last year, when everybody was asking, well, what is the market looking at as the market totally disconnected from the economy?
NEUT7|Now we're starting the year 2 year.
NEUT8|Two tends to be a little more frustrating for investors.
NEUT9|The narrative is clear.
NEUT10|There's consensus on the recovery, but markets don't move in a straight line and I think we have to remember that as investors.
NEUT11|But I think this rotation continues by sector by size, by style and by geography.
NEUT12|As markets grind higher over the course of this year, I'll be it, maybe with a bit more volatility.
BEAR13|By size, Marcie wanted to pick up on that call because I believe you're a fan of small caps which underperformed today, closing down almost a percent and have been a little bit weaker lately, though they are up the most of all of the four big averages from that March low a year ago at 135%.
NEUT14|Still a buy.
BEAR15|Yeah, so I would still buy on weakness in small caps were overweight both large and small in the US right now.
NEUT16|Think there's 3C's driving this market.
NEUT17|The consumer.
NEUT18|They've got fuel in their tanks, stimulus savings, and they're not waiting for the economy to reopen.
BULL19|You know, despite the weakness in travel stocks today, TSA checkpoint crossings are up.
BEAR20|Restaurant reservations are up.
NEUT21|The second one that was cap ex, and that's where I think you're going to see the beneficii Smallcap as the beneficiaries strong PMI's rising commodity prices.
NEUT22|But don't forget about tech because long term business spending plans focus on cybersecurity data.
NEUT23|The cloud and then finally I think you have to remember the yield curve is steepening that's pointing to an accommodative fed.
BULL24|I think that's positive for a lot of sectors as well.
NEUT25|Financials, materials, energy.
NEUT26|But don't forget those semiconductors, so I would continue to like small cap.
NEUT27|I'd be buyers on the weakness, and broadly, I'd be buyers on market weakness right now, because like I said, I don't think this is the top of the market.
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
