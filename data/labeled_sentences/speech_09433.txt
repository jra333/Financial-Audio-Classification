NEUT0|"""Hey guys is CP investing here in today?"
NEUT1|I will be going over Apple stock.
NEUT2|I'm I'm talking about Apple today because they.
NEUT3|Talked about how they wanted to get into the automotive industry and that could be huge for Apple.
NEUT4|Like absolutely huge.
NEUT5|They're already in the.
BULL6|Electronic like industry in the computer industry and they're already doing extremely well there.
NEUT7|And if they go in the automotive industry and can do the same thing or a similar thing, that could be huge.
NEUT8|But there's pros and cons to them going into the automotive industry, so some of the negatives that I think.
NEUT9|Or that?
NEUT10|They.
NEUT11|They're based on selling premium computers and phones and accessories like that.
BEAR12|So that has a higher margin, higher profit margin, and if they go to cars, that's a lower profit margin.
NEUT13|And going to different sector they have to do a lot of research, development, research and development into cars and batteries and stuff that they haven't gone into yet.
NEUT14|It will be completely new for them.
NEUT15|So this could take a lot of learning for them to get into.
BULL16|Buy some of the positives is that has tremendous upside.
BULL17|Home a company like Apple going into the automotive business would have a huge advantage compared to like these new newer spec companies that are going to specs and merging the companies 'cause Apple has a huge amount of cash.
NEUT18|Huge amount of assets that could help him with the research and production and they can have they can like hire other companies to help him out as well to make the cars help make parts and stuff like that.
NEUT19|So.
NEUT20|Apple has like a huge advantage there and then.
BULL21|If Apple were to push this, they could be one of the leaders, like by starting out 'cause they already have such a big name and Apple already has such a strong fan base and followers with their other products that pretty sure that those consumers would also want to try out the Apple vehicles which would really help out Apple's business.
NEUT22|So Apple is saying that they wanted to do this by 2024, so in four years three years 'cause it's almost 2021.
NEUT23|But if they were to do this, there would be.
BEAR24|This would be pretty huge for the Apple stock in the company.
NEUT25|Uhm?
NEUT26|So my price prediction if for this for 2021 will probably be I'm sitting around like 161 seventy.
NEUT27|It depends on what the news is.
NEUT28|I'm saying one 6170 on like a lowball.
NEUT29|That's what I'm saying.
NEUT30|I don't know.
NEUT31|There hasn't been enough news.
NEUT32|Yeah, I like how serious they are about this car stuff.
NEUT33|But if it's pretty serious thinking, shoot to the moon like by 2021 and 2021.
NEUT34|This could be easily over at 200 stock, but I'm saying like one.
NEUT35|6170 is kind of like a lowball for me.
NEUT36|And guys, I'm not a financial advisor, do your own due diligence.
NEUT37|Do your own research.
NEUT38|I just do this for fun.
