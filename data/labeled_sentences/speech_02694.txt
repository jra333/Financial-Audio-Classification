BULL0|"""Vaccinations continue to become more and more widespread, and stimulus legislation continues to work its way through Washington."
NEUT1|Both of these developments are being noticed by bond markets, and we see this in two different ways.
NEUT2|First, inflation expectations and Secondly, the shape of the yield curve.
NEUT3|Let's begin with inflation expectations.
NEUT4|Now inflation expectations as measured by the difference between nominal US Treasurys and Treasury inflation protected securities.
NEUT5|Are tips show that on average investors now price and inflation rate of two point 2% over the next decade.
BULL6|Now that's significantly higher than where we've been in the recent past, but it's not particularly high by historical standards.
NEUT7|If you look back at the 24 year histories of tips, you find that there are periods from as long as 2004 to 2014, where much of the time inflation expectations were above 2 1/2 percent, sometimes even as high as two point.
NEUT8|8% so inflation expectation at 2.2% is more of a reversion to the mean rather than an actual rise in inflation.
NEUT9|Expectations beyond historical norms.
NEUT10|Likewise, when you look at the yield curve, recently 30 or US Treasurys have begun to trade it over a 2% yield.
NEUT11|Now that's high by recent standards, but if you look back historically, for example, back to the beginning of the recovery in 2009 and 2010, you find that the yield curve is actually still exceptionally flat.
NEUT12|Back in 2009 and 2010, the Fed had short term rates at the same level that they are today, but long term interest rates 30 year bonds are trading between a four and 5% yield.
NEUT13|Today there less than half that level.
BULL14|But equity investors should take note if long term bond yields continue to rise in different inflation expectations continue to rise.
NEUT15|Eventually, investors in equities will potentially start to take notice and maybe begin to think about the possibility of selling some of their stocks for the safety of long term government bonds.
