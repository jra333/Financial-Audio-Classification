NEUT0|"""All these electric specs like to make detailed projections about the future something they couldn't do if they listed their stocks with traditional way via IPO, says you don't like it."
NEUT1|However, XL Fleet's a little different.
NEUT2|There near term forecasts are much more substantial than what you see from most of these pack names.
BULL3|Company already has a 12 month rolling sales pipeline, more than $220 million of potential new business opportunities.
BEAR4|Average order sizes have skyrocket XL Fleet's largest order this year was three times the size of the largest order in 2019.
NEUT5|Pretty good magic pleaser customers are going from a trial phase to a full definition phase.
BULL6|XL Fleet's on track to make 21 million in revenue this year.
NEUT7|Imagine please.
BULL8|They can grow to 75 million next year, 281 million in two 2022, then 647 million in 2023.
NEUT9|As heavy duty models and they were fully electric drivetrain scale up.
NEUT10|Pretty aggressive, but get this in 2024.
NEUT11|They're talking about really 1.4 billion in sales.
BULL12|Even better, the company thinks it can deliver positive earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization by 2022 guys.
NEUT13|That's right around the corner.
NEUT14|As usual, you gotta take these projections with big creative soul, but it's encouraging to see one of these electric specs forecast huge numbers in three or four years.
NEUT15|Instead of seven 8-9 ten, I do have two concerns.
NEUT16|First, EXO fleet seems like they've got a great bridge solution, but I don't know what happens to them once the actual truck makers start producing their own fully electric vehicles.
NEUT17|There are a bunch of startups working on this and forts coming out with electric models.
NEUT18|F-150 there building from Scratch Transit van 2022.
NEUT19|These are two of the Model XL fleet converts.
NEUT20|Maybe the market is big enough for all of them.
NEUT21|Maybe they start they start selling their powertrain, instructing the manufacturers.
NEUT22|But either way, this is something you gotta keep an eye on.
BEAR23|Second worry XL fleet does a lot of business with state and local governments which are totally broke right now because of the pandemic doesn't look like they'll be getting bailed out anytime soon.
NEUT24|Of course that problem should solve itself.
BEAR25|Once enough people are vaccinated and the world goes back to normal, but it might make next year a lot tougher now.
NEUT26|Pivotal Investment Corp Two closes on its merger with Excel Fleet early next week, and it sure doesn't hurt.
NEUT27|The pit bulls run by John Ledecky.
BULL28|He's a brilliant businessman with incredible track record.
NEUT29|You might know him as the guy who owns the Islanders.
NEUT30|I know him as a friend from college is in the Harvard Crimson with me.
NEUT31|Always look pretty good money maker based on what we know about the deal.
NEUT32|Pickles $15.
NEUT33|Stock values the combined business at 2.1 billion.
NEUT34|I gotta tell you in fact.
NEUT35|So if we can get even close to hitting its forecast for 2022 or 23 and we get some clarity on that relationship with Ford in the F-150, this stock is is cheap, darn cheap, something like quantum scape trades at 10 times its 2027 sales forecasts, XL Fleet would be trading at three point 3 * 2023 forecast.
NEUT36|Bottom line, with pivotal investment trading at $15 going to the Exo fleet merger.
BEAR37|I think this stock could be a steal.
NEUT38|Compelling stories pricing avoid stock good management, but if it starts flying this week, I'm begging.
NEUT39|Maybe you don't chase it too much.
NEUT40|Past 20.
NEUT41|But I like this one.
