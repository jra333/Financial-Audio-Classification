NEUT0|"""Maybe it's a little more easy to understand."
NEUT1|Jim.
NEUT2|Is this.
NEUT3|Call out of APY on Home Depot and Lowe's, which I'm sure you've got thoughts about.
BEAR4|Paroissien are calling for are saying the markets to LAX about the chances of a post pandemic reset in home improvement retail.
BEAR5|They take both stocks down to perform.
NEUT6|Look, I think that you could argue a lot of people are doing this, by the way, they're taking things down because they feel like the beyond meat call.
BEAR7|That stocks have moved too much and they want to be able to declare victory.
NEUT8|Everybody has a victory in Home Depot and Lowe's and load.
BULL9|These stocks are up tremendously from the bottom.
BULL10|Lozes up magnificently from the bottom.
NEUT11|You can make that call, but here's my here's my problem call.
NEUT12|How about if Home Depot goes from 279?
NEUT13|Say the 234?
NEUT14|Do you upgrade?
NEUT15|Are you playing the hedge fund game?
BEAR16|I think Home Depot is is magnificent company and it could come down a little, but if it does I don't think this stay at home.
BEAR17|Thing is going away when I read about Goldman the two companies.
NEUT18|They want to bring people back, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan.
NEUT19|Well, guess what?
NEUT20|I mean there were people who came down with Covid and now they're doing contact tracing.
BULL21|Not as well as I think it's the Chiefs game, but where they did incredible contact tracing.
NEUT22|But David, you know Jamie Dimon really wanted people to come back.
NEUT23|Yeah, he did.
NEUT24|He want Raiders come back and listen.
NEUT25|I think there's a desire on the part of people to go back to.
NEUT26|Not everybody, really, if you're young, but even I'm hearing from even my cohort that there's, you know, people are sort of tiring to a certain extent of working out of there.
NEUT27|Out of their homes, their spouses board then they don't like the dog.
NEUT28|It's been a long while ago.
NEUT29|Hey, let me go let me go risk it and getting colder than half a year.
NEUT30|At this point I suggest you stop by the Moderna trial and then go to JP.
BEAR31|Yeah, that doesn't mean that suddenly offices are going to be filled with people they're not, and in particular, as you point out, if we do get cases, which it seems inevitable, it's going to slow.
NEUT32|If not, stop entirely.
NEUT33|That sort of move back to the office, listen New York had been saying for some time you can come back to 50% and nobody seems to even be close to that number.
NEUT34|Closer to 10 to 20% is where things stand right now, and that's for urban areas.
NEUT35|"I think around the country."""
