NEUT0|"""Well, for across two cuts, so 50 in September and then and then 25 in December."
BULL1|So 75 by year end across two cuts.
NEUT2|And explain why it to the Economist mind.
NEUT3|It's going to take until September and then a dramatic half point cut.
NEUT4|I mean, what gets us to follow that sequence of events?
NEUT5|Well, there's three reasons.
NEUT6|I think we took this path.
BEAR7|One is that strengthen business spending has been weakening over the course of the year.
BEAR8|It looked like it was a government shutdown story early on.
BEAR9|But subsequent data industrial production, the durables reports the trade report also suggests a much weaker trend equipment spending we're tracking and negative terms, so there's just underlying softness in the data.
BEAR10|We were already prepared to make some downward adjustments to the forecast.
NEUT11|On top of that, you get the news on trade, which to us feels like an important shift and an escalation in the rhetoric.
NEUT12|And then finally I think you can.
NEUT13|You can argue that if this is true when things slow, even if inflation is.
BULL14|Is expected to rise the funds rate is Stillwell above.
NEUT15|Current rates of inflation.
NEUT16|So you might argue that the monetary policy setting is too tight.
NEUT17|Then the argument is look if you're going to.
BEAR18|The market is already pricing in three to four hikes or cuts over the next year.
NEUT19|Just deliver that upfront.
NEUT20|Act aggressively, prevent the need to get to the 0 lower bound.
NEUT21|So Act preemptively in a way that can deliver what the market feels that it needs.
NEUT22|And just do so in a way that's pre emptive.
NEUT23|the Fed generally does surprise on cuts.
NEUT24|Not so.
NEUT25|John hikes, that's true.
NEUT26|That's true.
NEUT27|I'm looking at these comments.
NEUT28|I don't know if you just saw them before we came on it from James Bullard.
BEAR29|He is now saying that a rate cut may be warranted soon because of global trade tensions and weak US inflation, but he's not Powell.
NEUT30|He's not cleared it, and we will hear from both of them tomorrow.
NEUT31|Are we going to start seeing a change in rhetoric this quickly?
NEUT32|Probably not, I so I. I think that it's hard for the Fed to move that quick without a lot of evidence that things are slowing.
NEUT33|I mean, our view is a perspective, one where we think the data will accumulate over time, and so that's why we're thinking September and not necessarily sooner.
NEUT34|We think it will take time for this case to build.
NEUT35|Now.
NEUT36|You could get the Fed react sooner if markets were to take a more sudden risk off tone.
NEUT37|We don't feel that that's the case yet, so that's why I'm thinking September more than something soon.
NEUT38|I'm just wondering, what if they don't?
NEUT39|We gotta go, Michael, but what if it's all fine?
NEUT40|You know 75 basis points, a lot.
NEUT41|It is I got it.
NEUT42|Maybe we're overthinking things here, but we just feel that that's what's coming.
NEUT43|"That's all right."""
