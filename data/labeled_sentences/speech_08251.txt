NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead."
NEUT1|Will we give you the straight talk you need about what lies ahead in these turbulent times?
BULL2|The stock market is doing well.
NEUT3|Why?
BULL4|Because the economy is opening up, an progress is being made in getting that vaccine against COVID-19.
NEUT5|However, investors should be cautious.
BEAR6|There are two big clouds on the horizon.
NEUT7|One is right here at home.
BEAR8|Several big states are being very slow.
BEAR9|Unreasonably slow in opening up their economies, the big ones are New York, California, Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
NEUT10|Together they have a number of smaller states make up 1/3 of the economy, and that's going to drag the rest of the US economy where one entity not 50 different ones.
BULL11|So let's hope they speed up their recoveries.
NEUT12|The way Florida has, and Georgia has in a responsible way, the other big cloud is the growing an unbelievably truculence and belligerence of China.
NEUT13|Everywhere in the world, it seems look at what's happening in Hong Kong.
NEUT14|Their autonomies been ended that wasn't supposed to happen to 2047.
BEAR15|No wonder their rights in the streets in Hong Kong as they lose their freedoms.
BEAR16|Australia China is cutting back its imports from Australia.
NEUT17|Why?
BEAR18|'cause the Australians demanded an end to the cover up of what happened with COVID-19 and the Chinese are punishing them.
BEAR19|China's also been sending aircraft to harass South Korea, violating their airspace and look at what they're doing to Taiwan.
BEAR20|On the scene in the air, hoping to intimidate the island, Taiwan is not going to back down.
BEAR21|Most ominously is what's happening on the Chinese Indian border, where tensions are ramping up.
NEUT22|Remember, China attacked India 1962 in that same area.
BEAR23|A short, but intense war ensued.
NEUT24|Why is China doing this?
BULL25|Hopefully China will back down using a face saving proposal from Donald Trump to mediate the so-called dispute between China and India.
BEAR26|Not hostilities might result what China is doing creates uncertainty, and uncertainty means less trade and less investment.
NEUT27|So yes, enjoy the stock market rise.
NEUT28|But beware of those two clouds.
NEUT29|They are overhanging all of US investors.
NEUT30|Take note.
NEUT31|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT32|Thank you for listening.
NEUT33|Don't hesitate to send in your comments or suggestions.
BULL34|"In the meantime, take care, look forward to seeing you soon."""
