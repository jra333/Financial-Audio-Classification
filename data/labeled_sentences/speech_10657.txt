NEUT0|"""Let's get to a mad dash beyond meat."
NEUT1|Yeah, this is what I call football name David, meaning that there are companies that are, let's say the brokerage community is really divided.
NEUT2|Some guys just love it.
NEUT3|Some guys hate it and just goes bounce back and forth and sucking up doing nothing.
NEUT4|Really gutsy.
NEUT5|Upgrade by City today saying let's not forget they have Pepsi.
NEUT6|They had McDonald's.
NEUT7|They have Yum.
NEUT8|Now none of those is really kicking in right now because these are food service and you don't get as much business as you're going to have.
BULL9|But the premise here is that Ethan Brown is doing a good job as CEO.
BULL10|They've had a lot of turnover there.
BULL11|And I think once food service opens up, it's going to be really good for them.
NEUT12|Are they the best tasting they don't have GMO and the younger generation, if they sense that there is GMO, just won't go for it.
NEUT13|So I like this call.
NEUT14|I think it's a gutsy call.
NEUT15|I think when food service opens Ethan, Ethan is going to make a lot of money.
NEUT16|I think you buy beyond me.
NEUT17|Right here, right here.
BEAR18|Got sequel 'cause it's not gonna be good quarter.
NEUT19|They pretty much said that too.
NEUT20|I like these partnerships.
BULL21|David Yum Israel McDonald's coming in matters a great deal.
NEUT22|In Pepsi and what I would tell you is it's very carried, even very charismatic, and he's a messianic so to speak, OK?
NEUT23|Early days still, you think then your old friends and they keep making it taste better and better.
NEUT24|And I've used it all the time because my kids are vegetarian, vegan and I find it to be good tasting.
BULL25|Is good tasting as a true burger.
NEUT26|I don't think so and I think that's an issue.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
