NEUT0|"""We've got a news alert on Amazon."
NEUT1|The company could start delivering coronavirus test kits to certain customers CNBC dot Coms.
NEUT2|Chrissy Farr just broke the story on our website and she joins us now.
BULL3|Chrissy, good to see you.
NEUT4|What do we know?
NEUT5|Yeah, I mean so lots happening right now with with Amazon.
NEUT6|They're thinking what can we do given that the coronavirus has just become a pandemic?
NEUT7|An one idea they've had that they've talked about with the Gates Foundation and a number of other hospitals in their local Seattle is can we deliver these testing kids to the home?
NEUT8|And that way people don't need to potentially come in to see a doctor in person?
NEUT9|That's less exposure.
NEUT10|And it also means they don't have to deliver these kids in the Mail.
NEUT11|So Amazon thrown up their hand and they basically said we'll do it for free.
NEUT12|We will use our drivers and they'll come to the home starting potentially even as soon as tomorrow.
NEUT13|This is a big deal, Chris.
NEUT14|He was actually chatting with a friend of mine is an ER doctor a couple of days ago he said you know what?
NEUT15|I got people that have, you know real?
NEUT16|You know they get car wreck or they have a gunshot and somebody comes in with a fever and I've got to put on my hazmat suit, take their temperature, take the suit off there fine.
NEUT17|I send them home anyway.
NEUT18|I've got real triage and trauma to deal with these, like I'm eating an hour or two a day of my time because people are so paranoid they're rushing in with a small fever.
BULL19|This I would imagine is a big step toward him, alleviating some of the burden that our doctors and our nurses are starting to feel out there.
BEAR20|Hospitals are just overwhelmed.
NEUT21|You're absolutely right, you know you're seeing in some countries, some hospitals, even Nickelback doctors from retirement, it's getting to that place.
BEAR22|I've been talking to hospitals who are saying they're running low on surgical masks.
NEUT23|People are just outright stealing them.
BULL24|It's crazy even hand sanitizer, so anything that these big tech companies can do with all the resources that they have to hand, I think, is a really positive step.
NEUT25|And Amazon has said, you know, we want to help with misinformation.
NEUT26|We want to help with price gouging on our marketplace.
NEUT27|But to then now see them going this next step further and saying, let's some, let's do it, we can because in Seattle it's a it's a hot spot already for the coronavirus, and physicians were overwhelmed, and so they want to do their part.
NEUT28|And even if it's just logistics and delivery, it's still something I think it is something, certainly anything we do to reduce that burden on doctors.
BULL29|Thank you very much, Christy.
