NEUT0|"""One of the things I was shocked about this is not an American company."
NEUT1|Again, I thought us in American company.
NEUT2|The growth, amazingly, is international.
BULL3|Yeah, we're actually very fortunate we are a global company and we're growing extraordinarily fast in the United States.
NEUT4|But you're right about international.
NEUT5|I mean, two years ago, we started to talk about that it was an objective and we announced on this call that by over the course of this year, we're going to Crest over 1,000,000 subscribers outside the United States across 190 different countries.
NEUT6|So what we do is something that every student around the world clearly needs and, and we're proud of what we do.
BULL7|And it's exciting to see this level of growth when your stock was at three.
NEUT8|Free box we came here and you talked about the reason why I believe what you said.
NEUT9|The transition to online learning is inevitable.
NEUT10|It's just I guess you didn't as you say, expect that a catalyst would come along that was so monumental.
NEUT11|Absolutely right.
NEUT12|Look I I predicted we would be at a print textbooks six years ago, so I was wrong.
NEUT13|My timing is never right, but just think about it.
NEUT14|Imagine a world where 50% of the world's population is below the age of 30, so we know technology is what they've grown up with.
NEUT15|And we all know they're going to need to learn more more often more things.
BEAR16|They're going to need to be self supporting, because institutions, governments educations their budgets are going down their willingness to support is going down, and so this is the wave of the future.
NEUT17|It's been here.
BEAR18|One of the most interesting statistics is is college admissions were sort of flat last year and a little bit down, particularly in community colleges where people who have to work in order to pay for their college lost their job and lost that ability to get education.
BULL19|But the same time the online universities grew 30%.
NEUT20|This is the wave of the future of either institutions.
NEUT21|Understand it, invest in it and re evaluate what they teach, how they teach it, how they monitor students, and how they assess them or they're going to lose completely.
