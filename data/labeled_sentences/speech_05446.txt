BULL1|They've done great in terms of taking business away from brick and mortar retail, but what's really impressive about them as a WS Amazon Web Services, they have a relatively small market share and we all know that Jeff Bezos is the champion of taking market share from competitors, so we think that's a stock that's going to perform very, very well, and we've certainly seen that on a relative basis over the last couple weeks.
NEUT2|Obit, because last year was a bit behind some of the other big techniques, which is probably one of the reasons it didn't sell off.
NEUT3|Some.
NEUT4|Are you getting enough of an opportunity?
NEUT5|I mean, did it sell off?
NEUT6|As hard as well, again, we're not talking about stagnant capital, right?
NEUT7|Money moves, money comes in new clients and clients have more money, so and it's also about rotation.
NEUT8|"But again, in the context of a broader portfolio, if I had to pick one name, Amazon is it."""
