BEAR0|"""Our yields so low because of concerns outside of our borders, and if so, are they a steel right now?"
NEUT1|I mean, if you're buying a house, if your pricing you know for a car loan or something like that, is this a gift?
NEUT2|So I think there's there's two drivers.
NEUT3|One is the international pressures when it comes to global growth, not being what it was before and then the other one is just a trade tensions.
NEUT4|We've touched on this before, which is a couple of weeks back.
NEUT5|You'll start to fall, yet the equity market continued to rally and you know my question is 1's gotta give.
BULL6|It seems like bonds are telling the story a little bit stronger.
NEUT7|And now equities are starting to follow rather than the other way around.
NEUT8|So your point of view it as far as the US is concerned, is growth slowing down?
BEAR9|Well, not only that growth is slowing down, one is we're in the late stage of the cycle, so at some point domestically things are going to slow down, even though we haven't seen, this is still a mixed signal when it comes to the data, but the other aspect of it was the trade situation hasn't improved, it has deteriorated, and it seemed like the equity markets were kind of shrugging it off.
NEUT10|While bond markets are saying, you know what risk has gone up a little bit.
NEUT11|So you're saying in Jim I'll ask you, it's not so much that we're pricing in in the US is slow down, although that's.
NEUT12|Part of it, Jim.
NEUT13|It's more that you have to price in some outcome from tariffs now more so than you might have a couple of weeks ago.
NEUT14|Is that right?
NEUT15|How would you describe the set up for investors here?
BEAR16|I think Kelly that the the slowdown globally and in the United States this year brought this about and that was because of policy tightening, not only in the United States but around the globe that eventually led to a slowdown.
NEUT17|I think we're at now, though I think it's more about fear than fundamentals.
NEUT18|At this point.
NEUT19|We've got two things and I might even put the bond market as the primary thing that investors are worried about at this point above the trade war.
NEUT20|So just to be clear, you're saying?
BEAR21|Stock market investors are worried about the bond market.
NEUT22|Yes, yes, I think I think that's kind of where we've gotten to now.
BEAR23|We we've inverted this yield curve almost by a full 25 basis points from the target Toyo 250 area on the funds rate.
BEAR24|And it just keeps falling even in the face of economic news, which hasn't been all that bad.
NEUT25|It's been mixed it worse, and the stock market is wondering what does the bond market know?
NEUT26|And if you put that together with an inverted curve, yeah?
NEUT27|Is that some?
NEUT28|I'm not, you know, the Kelly, I think both of our fears, if you will.
NEUT29|Yeah, what's interesting about this is not like the normal crisis of a balance sheet blowout that we can't.
NEUT30|It's going to take a long time to fix.
NEUT31|We could.
NEUT32|These could change on a dime.
NEUT33|"You could have a 3:00 AM tweet and you could have a fed fed cut and it would all change the outlook in a matter of minutes."""
