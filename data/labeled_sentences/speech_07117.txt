BEAR0|"""Tim Cook is firing back at a Wall Street Journal report on tensions between Apple and Jony Ive."
NEUT1|I still have trouble with the first name that's that's the Johnny version of Jonathan is what I finally figured out.
NEUT2|If you seen it like that a lot, though, I don't know.
BEAR3|Anyway, the longtime design chief who announced his departure.
BEAR4|Last week, the Journal claims that I've had been drifting away from Apple in recent years and leaving the design team without leadership, but in an email to NBC News, Cook calls the story absurd in the conclusions in his words, just don't match with reality, he said at a base level.
BEAR5|It shows a lack of understanding about the how the design team works and how Apple Works.
NEUT6|It distorts relationships, decisions and events to the point that we just don't recognize the company it claims to describe.
NEUT7|And the response literally wear for cooking typically doesn't communicate directly with reporters over something like this.
BEAR8|And internal shakeup normally companies don't push back and less they feel like it's totally an error.
BEAR9|Or they feel that it's really riling things up.
NEUT10|Look, this is what you do for your team.
NEUT11|I looked at it to see you as it now you think he's wrong.
NEUT12|He's lying.
NEUT13|Now I know I'm saying if you were running the company and you care about your team and you want to support your team, you put out a letter that's that, says affectively.
NEUT14|Effectively this, I think there is no question that there are parts of that story.
NEUT15|Massage it a little this sort of broader idea that Jony Ive has been less connected to the company over the last couple of years.
NEUT16|I think is not.
NEUT17|I can't even fathom would be in dispute with anybody because it's just factually signing it.
NEUT18|Designing a phone in the features of a phone or watch.
NEUT19|Or a Mac designing those features and then being involved with the design of the new headquarters is right.
NEUT20|Then you knew that it's not the same thing really, and he's sort of in this role where maybe there wasn't as much to design 'cause there's no new innovations.
NEUT21|You know, I think the larger issue was no.
NEUT22|There were times.
NEUT23|No, but then you doing OK, but Johnny Johnny has wanted to leave Johnny a couple of times and will try to leave the company he is been living in San Francisco.
NEUT24|He's been living in England.
NEUT25|He's been living in these other places.
NEUT26|It's very hard to run a couple of designs out.
NEUT27|A couple $100 million.
NEUT28|He's got company.
NEUT29|It's hard to run the design team from, you know remotely.
NEUT30|And try to contend and argue to the public that somehow you're in there every day fighting the good fight.
NEUT31|I'm not saying he wasn't fighting good fight.
NEUT32|I think he was involved and engaged to some degree, but.
NEUT33|You know, I think that there's this is all shades of Gray, and I look this.
NEUT34|Would I think that Tim wrote a good note and that's what it is.
NEUT35|I don't think they were specifically.
NEUT36|The flip side is when you have factual problems with an article you come out and you say that these are the factual problems with the article.
NEUT37|It's harder to just broadly brush and say well the whole thing and you walk like even you respond exactly what you can respond to without actually.
BEAR38|"It sounded like he was responding to the idea that there are tensions between them and that they were arguing and back and forth."""
