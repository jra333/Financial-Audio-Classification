BULL0|"""Hello and welcome to this technical analysis video for July 20th here theexact.com it's been another bullish week for Dollar Yen as the Fed chief expressed that the best strategy for the US Central Bank is to continue gradually raising interest rates."
BEAR1|But yesterday we have seen dollar falling sharply as the US president said that he's not happy with higher interest rates and now looking at the daily chart, we can see that at some point on Wednesday.
BULL2|We had a price slightly above 113 resistance for the first time in ten months and then on Thursday at the market touched the Newton North High at 113.15.
BEAR3|However, following President's comments, the market could not retain gains dropping back below 113 to trade today at 112.40.
BULL4|But we still have this subject line in place and this is likely to hold in the short term as the market has increased enough distance above the mobile cloud and it's moving.
BULL5|Averages and considering this Golden cross between the 50 day and 200 day moving average lines, we can say that the upward pattern could continue in the longer term as well.
BULL6|Momentum is also expected to be positive in the short term since the Mac D fluctuates above 0 and it's red signal line also in the very short term.
NEUT7|Downside corrections cannot be excluded because VSI is near oversold levels.
BULL8|Actually is heading upwards to break the 70 level again.
BEAR9|Besides, if you look closer at the candles, we can see that the market has created a bearish doji on Wednesday and with a red candle following the next day.
BEAR10|This could be a sign that the price might cause further losses in the coming days.
BEAR11|Now, in case the price indeed had self, it would be reasonable to look for support around one hundred 112 because the market has been creating a floor around this area the past few days and therefore the price could stop once again over here.
BEAR12|However, this base breaks support could run towards the previous peak of 111.38 where the 20 day moving average is also located while moving even lower the area between the 50 day, the 200 day moving average is currently seen between 110.50 and 110.
NEUT13|Could also be a potential obstacle.
BULL14|On the upside, now I move higher, could retest Thursdays peak of 113.15 while indecisive, close above from here, could touch.
BULL15|113.70 strong resistance back in December before attention turns to 114.72, the highest mark reached since March 2017.
NEUT16|So that's all for me.
NEUT17|Thank you for watching.
BULL18|"Have a great day."""
