NEUT0|"""Hello YouTube."
NEUT1|Welcome back to my channel.
NEUT2|Let's talk stocks so quick update on Lucid Motors merge.
NEUT3|There's just been an article released on bloomberg.com.
NEUT4|You can see the time it's released down there so literally released around about 10 minutes ago.
NEUT5|I'll leave the article the full article in the description below so you can never read through it, but it says Lucid Motors is nearing a deal to go public for a merger.
NEUT6|And it basically is speculating that it is going to be CC Ivy.
NEUT7|If you Scroll down.
NEUT8|This is the most important and exciting, but it's a deal for the electric vehicle maker could be announced on Tuesday.
BEAR9|Two of the people said the talks are ongoing, but it could still fall apart.
NEUT10|So we've actually got a date there.
NEUT11|Up till now, we haven't really had any dates.
NEUT12|A lot of people were saying about merger Monday, that was kind of like lots of speculation because in the past a lot of mergers happen on a Monday, but now we actually have a date, so potentially Tuesday, so three days away there could be an announcement so.
NEUT13|I'm guessing Monday when the market opened, it's going to be very, very bullish on Civ.
NEUT14|So now is your opportunity if you want to get involved.
BEAR15|I feel like Monday is going to be the last time 'cause if they announce it on Tuesday, it's gonna go through the roof.
NEUT16|But as always I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT17|This is just my opinion.
NEUT18|If I go over to my holding on 212.
BEAR19|You can see that it took a little dip before the market closed on Friday and it leveled up around 52 just before close.
BEAR20|I currently have 30 shares of invested just over 1000 pounds and I'm currently down Â£46.
BULL21|So like I said, if the merger does get announced on Tuesday, I can see it rocketing up.
NEUT22|Might hit that $100 mark, but then you're going to start getting lots of people selling, so you have a like a dip again and then it might level out around the $70.00 mark for awhile.
NEUT23|Let me know in the comments section below if you're holding Civ or if you're watching it or you're thinking about getting involved.
BULL24|"Thanks very much for watching and I'll see in the next video."""
