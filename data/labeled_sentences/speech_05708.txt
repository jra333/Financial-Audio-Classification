NEUT0|"""Paying with Bitcoin is still not really very common, but that's one reason real estate is starting to get in on the crypto action."
NEUT1|Buying a house with Bitcoin.
NEUT2|Here's CNBC's Diana Olick, this Manhattan Beach CA home recently sold for Bitcoin, one of a growing number of mostly high end properties.
NEUT3|Now being listed an purchased in cryptocurrency, I would say we're just at the beginning.
NEUT4|We met real estate agent Dan Crypto expert Tony Giordano three years ago.
NEUT5|When he listed this massive Malibu home for sale in Bitcoin, it ended up selling in dollars.
NEUT6|But that was then what's happened since that last is it's become more popular where people are asking more often.
NEUT7|How do I go about buying a home using Bitcoin or cryptocurrency as the form of currency for buying real estate, which is why his company now has a crypto management division designed to help agents and consumers through the process and he shared some advice with us.
NEUT8|First, you'll need to find a real estate agent who knows how to work with Bitcoin.
NEUT9|Someone who's already facilitated a transaction.
NEUT10|If you're a buyer or a seller, paid off properties with no mortgage, make the transaction much easier.
NEUT11|You'll also need a crypto real estate attorney, someone who specializes in the paperwork and liability aspects.
NEUT12|And finally, you'll need a third party escrow that is a Bitcoin mover who can both transfer and hold the token.
NEUT13|I've been accepting Bitcoin since 2013.
NEUT14|When I owned and managed coffee shops up here in upstate New York, which is why Paul Paterakis decided to list his Troy, NY home for both Bitcoin and dollars, I just put it up in January as a Bitcoin listing and then a few days later I did have an offer in U.S. dollars so that was pending, so I did not see.
NEUT15|What Bitcoin could offer?
NEUT16|And that may be the biggest issue for Bitcoin in today's Ultra competitive real estate market.
BULL17|Demand is so high that sellers are likely to get multiple offers in dollars before Bitcoin ever enters the picture.
BULL18|That said, on the Ultra high end where competition is less, an international buyers play a listing in Bitcoin will garner more attention and more buzz about the property, and could ultimately lead to a faster sale.
NEUT19|Shep is that a Dogwood or cherry blossoms.
NEUT20|Weeping cherry blossom.
BULL21|Well, that'll help.
NEUT22|Sell Diana every time.
BULL23|Thank you so much.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
