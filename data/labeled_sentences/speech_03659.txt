NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back Easter 29th of March 2021.
NEUT2|Monday, the first day of the week where #38 herdeiro hash graph with the ticker fish bar for herdeiro hashgraph against BTC.
NEUT3|We seem to be doing well, but to be honest I would prefer it if we correct lower, why because this means that are there are hash graph 3 forming a very, very big symmetrical triangle and then we bust out of it, right?
NEUT4|This would be the best case scenario in my opinion for a barrel hash graph so.
NEUT5|Point is, we don't see any clear treated with patterns for H bar against BTC.
BULL6|We have been rising higher and higher.
NEUT7|I think this could be the completion of a wave 512345.
BULL8|So I think that's very likely we're going to pop higher.
NEUT9|We're going to take out the highest over here.
NEUT10|We will complete away 5 and after that we will correct lower, right?
BULL11|So, in my opinion, I think that there is still more upside to go for his bar against BTC.
BULL12|And then once we pop higher eventually you're going to see a deep correction.
NEUT13|Come on for his part.
NEUT14|So be very, very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT15|Feel that there is a correction coming on.
NEUT16|It's not too far away, and even if you do pop higher, I change feeling this will be a.
NEUT17|Double Berry style agents right higher high on the price but lower high under Mindy Lower Hyunday RSI double bearish divergance, which means that there could be a new trend change coming on for his bar against BTC, so you could take a tree if you want to, but I wouldn't.
NEUT18|I absolutely wouldn't and right now is actually selling season is not buying season so be very careful about going to a trade too soon for her Ashcraft, especially against BTC as we want to his bar against USD T But before that please give this video like.
NEUT19|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about his bar in the comments below for his war against USDT.
NEUT20|Yeah, I'm not exactly sure what's happening again.
NEUT21|The same thing could be happening for his bar USD T as well.
BULL22|Double bearish divergance.
BEAR23|Higher high on the price but lower high on Demande lower high on the RSI so my guess again is pure guessing.
BULL24|My guess is that we're going to be slightly higher and then we might form a higher high on his power against USD T. So yeah, there you go.
BULL25|However we are above the skinny pink line and as long as we are above the skin pink line we remain bias bullish for his power against USD.
NEUT26|TI think that even if we do correct very likely this will be with four with one with two we have three with four.
NEUT27|There will still be another wave higher, right so?
NEUT28|Here we could take trips for his bar, but in my opinion, not now right.
NEUT29|Things are very overbought so you gotta wait for his bar to drop back under the zero line right before making any moves, right?
NEUT30|So we might not drop down to zero line, so again now we have to wait for things to correct properly first before making any moves for his bar against USD, right?
NEUT31|So we are anticipating a wave four and once we see a way for we will take a right for a with five, right?
NEUT32|And so yeah, be very careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT33|I see from my husband technical analysis.
BULL34|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL35|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT36|"I shall see you in the next video."""
