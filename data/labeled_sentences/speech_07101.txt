NEUT0|"""OK, next question, can we look at Icon Icx please?"
NEUT1|OK, Bill, if you could pull that up on your end.
NEUT2|Let me also give a preview here on.
NEUT3|Weather trends indicator.
BULL4|So the low frequency indicator is still bullish on icon.
BEAR5|It's been bullish since 41 cents icon right now is at 233.
NEUT6|The accuracy of this is about 66% on this meeting.
NEUT7|That one is right, meaning that when it's right if it's bullish, keeps on going up.
NEUT8|In this version, it goes down.
BEAR9|If we go to the high frequency indicator, that's also still bullish since $0.41.
NEUT10|Now let's see what are the TA has to say.
NEUT11|OK, pulling it up here now.
NEUT12|OK, so this this is.
NEUT13|This is a very interesting picture, right?
NEUT14|This is icon.
NEUT15|It's really trying to take out this $2.00 level.
NEUT16|It looks like you had some late stage FOMO in this.
NEUT17|Okta terms.
NEUT18|You may be seeing a five wave structure.
NEUT19|Right which I can try and draw?
NEUT20|Now the fact it's above $2.00 does mean it can go to three.
NEUT21|There is room for it to go to three.
NEUT22|However, sellers are out there.
NEUT23|This is the theme that we've been going across the entire show.
NEUT24|So when you see this type of candle where it shoots up to 275 and then gets rejected back down to 30.
NEUT25|In a normal set of circumstances I'd be like, hey, let's take a shot at three.
NEUT26|I'm not willing to do that.
NEUT27|Not if you made money in this.
NEUT28|You know you should think about taking it.
NEUT29|If you want to hold on for three at least at least manage your PNL sensibly.
