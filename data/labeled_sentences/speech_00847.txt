NEUT0|"""Hey everybody crypto Mentor 99."
NEUT1|How you doing?
NEUT2|The only reason I started saying that is 'cause you all encouraged me in the comments how you doing, how you doing, how you doing OK?
NEUT3|Friday I did a stock trade ticker symbol ACB.
NEUT4|I think I was out in 4 minutes.
NEUT5|I think I made.
NEUT6|2 1/2 percent 3% I forget.
NEUT7|Well, what I forgot about.
NEUT8|So I bought and sold.
BEAR9|And then I forgot that I bought on Friday and kind of forgot about it.
NEUT10|And over the weekend I was going through my notes.
NEUT11|I got like a little old school notepad.
NEUT12|I'm like I'll be a son of a gun.
NEUT13|I bought more ACB when I bought ACB at Eleven $6911.69 which at the time I think it hit 12.
NEUT14|On Friday, if I'm not mistaken, anyhow.
BEAR15|I'm like, oh, there's no way it's going back to 1169 'cause it kind of tanked on Friday.
NEUT16|Of course, after I bought it at 1169.
NEUT17|So.
NEUT18|Woke up this morning.
BULL19|Stock market futures was up like 1600 points on like I kind of check my ACB so it was like 1350 premarket I should've sold.
NEUT20|I didn't like what maybe I'll go up to 14 anyhow.
BULL21|Probably 1/2 hour after the open an hour after the open I got out of 1205 twelve dollars and five cents 3% profit.
NEUT22|Hey, my goal is 1 1/2%.
