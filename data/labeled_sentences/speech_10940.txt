NEUT0|"""What's up, everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to the first installment of Deep Thoughts from the Kitchen.
NEUT2|So I was doing the dishes, getting ready for the night packing up, and I was thinking about the Michael Saylor Bitcoin for Corporations conference.
NEUT3|It's kind of everyone knows about.
NEUT4|It's all been going on.
NEUT5|What has that done for the value of all crypto currencies, specifically Voyager, but what also has GameStop situation done for trusting the stock market compared to the decentralized crypto world.
NEUT6|So I had a number in my head before which was probably $10.
NEUT7|Very very conservative at the end of 2021.
BULL8|To up to $30 at the end of 2021.
NEUT9|So my question to you guys is, has the GameStop situation and the Sailor conference with bunch of billionaires and millionaires there has that accelerated every cryptocurrency and if so, by how much?
NEUT10|So I'd love to know your comments below.
NEUT11|What your old number was, and if you do have a new number and please share because I want to get a lot of newbies who are into this space seeing the reality of the potential growth here of three times your money.
NEUT12|10 times your money 20 times your money, right?
NEUT13|Lot of people think it's a gimmick.
NEUT14|It's a scam at some informercials I try to tell my family members even still and they tell me can't touch it.
NEUT15|Can't see it, don't trust it and that's fine.
NEUT16|I respect that, but I think what's going on in the world.
NEUT17|Things are changing.
NEUT18|I love being on the ground floor.
NEUT19|Seeing this in the front row and I want you guys to be a part of it to where the average blue collar person can take just a couple $1000 and turned it into potentially a couple $100,000.
NEUT20|Or put a little more in and become a millionaire.
NEUT21|The average blue collar worker.
NEUT22|This is real.
NEUT23|This is true.
NEUT24|This is happening, but I want your comments below to show people that this stuff is in a gimmick.
NEUT25|This 10 times your money this 30 times your money.
NEUT26|It isn't just people blowing smoke.
NEUT27|So if you guys can.
NEUT28|Please get involved in the community, below.
NEUT29|Get other people believing in this 'cause I truly do believe in Voyager.
NEUT30|I love Bitcoin.
