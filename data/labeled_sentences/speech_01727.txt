BEAR0|"""Well, taking a step back and looking at the broader market we are looking at a mixed picture."
NEUT1|The Dow right around a record NASDAQ, though an SMP continues to be trading in the red, we want to bring in Jerrod Blicker E for a look at some of the names that he's watching into the clothes injured.
NEUT2|What do you have your eye on?
NEUT3|Well, you talk about those Warren Buffett stocks up by excuse me.
NEUT4|Bought by Berkshire Hathaway only disclosed yesterday, but happened during the first quarter.
NEUT5|Guess what?
NEUT6|The buffet effect is in full effect.
BULL7|Verizon, our parent company, up over 5% on news that of the stake initiation Chevron.
BULL8|That's up 3%.
BULL9|In fact, the entire energy sector was bid even when crude oil was slightly down this morning.
NEUT10|Also getting into the pharmaceutical space and increasing investments there.
NEUT11|Some buying and AbbVie.
BULL12|That's up 2% today.
NEUT13|Bristol Myers squibb's.
NEUT14|1.9% Merck another 2% here.
NEUT15|And guess what?
NEUT16|He's selling Apple and it's not a lot, it's just a little bit.
BEAR17|By far his biggest stake, but just the news that Berkshire Hathaway was dumping a little bit, trimming a little bit of this position.
BEAR18|Apple down 2%.
NEUT19|I do want to look at a longer term chart here of Apple because I think something interesting is going on here.
NEUT20|Here's a three month look and you can see that we are now breaking this neckline.
BEAR21|And also I would note that were below the 50 day moving average just now, so we.
NEUT22|Put the 50 day moving average on here.
NEUT23|Could be a sign of things to come.
NEUT24|You don't want to see Apple breaking down when it's still the biggest public company in the world.
NEUT25|Also, taking a look at the broader market here now we began today largely in the red.
BULL26|We've seen stocks, especially the Dow really surged to record highs.
BEAR27|Now some of the NASDAQ and other indices like the S&P 500 are lagging.
NEUT28|But check out what's happening in the crypto space.
NEUT29|Really interesting that we see Bitcoin and Ethereum.
BULL30|Up on days when we have the US dollar surging and gold sinking, as you noted, shut up.
NEUT31|Hey Jared, it's Adam I. I'm curious we're going to hear a lot more from Roaring Kitty, which sounds like a Bond girl from the 1960s, but is actually a trader named I Keith Gillan.
NEUT32|It has to do with the lawsuit and the GameStop.
NEUT33|All of this news breaking before the hearing tomorrow.
NEUT34|Yeah, lots of breaking news here and we just got the testimony prepared testimony of some of the people who are going to be at that hearing.
NEUT35|But back to this lawsuit that was filed in federal court in Massachusetts.
NEUT36|It's supposed to be or?
NEUT37|I guess the goal is to be a class action lawsuit that has to be decided by the judge.
NEUT38|But this is probably one of the first of many lawsuits and not the first 'cause we've already seen some other lawsuits against brokers is getting one of many lawsuits that we're saying here allegations against Keith Gill here is that he purported to be or represented himself to be.
NEUT39|A retail investor, when in fact he is a licensed professional.
NEUT40|Well, we'll have to see how that plays out in court, but I think there going to be some pointed questions in tomorrow's hearing on that.
BULL41|"Alright great, thanks so much."""
