BULL0|"""Hey guys, how you doing so?"
BULL1|Because there's been a lot of action in the old Queen Market last few days and XR peas had a decent run.
NEUT2|I thought I'd make another price analysis videos, give you some check analysis of what I'm seeing in the charts.
NEUT3|This is XRP USD on the one day the thin blue lines are resistance lines that could be tenant support should be closer candle above them.
NEUT4|Hopefully we start to use these support so you can see here is that.
NEUT5|I think it be ranging between 62 and 77.
NEUT6|If we can hold above $0.62 this is a more zoomed out perspective of the one day.
NEUT7|So if you look at my previous videos I did draw this ascending channel in quite awhile ago.
NEUT8|And as you can see, it's kind of cool because it is kind of respecting the bottom channel line, so hopefully this is the price movement that we see going forward.
NEUT9|This is a more zoomed in perspective on the one hour so you can see what I'm saying about ranging between 77 and 62 cents and then on the one minute just where we are today.
NEUT10|Just trying to get above that sixty 199 and stay above it.
NEUT11|Our main targets, 80 cent.
NEUT12|"If we can break and hold of there we could be looking at 2:40."""
