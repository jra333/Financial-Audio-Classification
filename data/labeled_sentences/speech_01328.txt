NEUT0|"""Yo what's going on YouTube?"
NEUT1|I'm going to continue on my stock series and today's episode we're going to get right into it.
BULL2|She gave me head.
NEUT3|Alright, last one I did.
NEUT4|I did it on a CB.
NEUT5|ECB was at a marijuana stock company that I said if it ticked up above $7.00 that would make another video.
NEUT6|Here we are.
NEUT7|It's only about four days later.
NEUT8|Minimize this chart.
NEUT9|Right here.
NEUT10|I'll show you guys what's going on, so when when we last chatted it was sitting in the $7.00 range and two days ago it actually had a spike, it spiked up to about $8.00.
NEUT11|Second.
NEUT12|Take a look at my last video show, you guys, what I was kind of getting into 690 hit about $7.00 has heavy resistance at about $7.00, so be careful and if it does break that I will try to make another video.
NEUT13|You can see that it's.
BULL14|Touch on 7 pretty consistently here.
NEUT15|Hasn't had much support up there at that 12.
BULL16|So basically ECB finally broke through its resistance pattern of $7.00.
NEUT17|Range are going to go here and take a look.
NEUT18|When I made that video prior to this one, it was in that 690 range touching on that pattern.
NEUT19|I've been kind of showing what patterns to look for.
NEUT20|What are the most powerful patterns and showing that this pattern right here is kind of at its breakpoint?
NEUT21|Anything past this is going to be trying to touch on the resistance of the previous months and that 12 range so that 12 range is back in play where have previously said that it didn't have much resistance.
BULL22|Now that it has broken that $7.00 range.
BULL23|Right now, it's getting shorted a little bit state it's taken a little pullback, but the news that ACB received yesterday was pretty positive.
NEUT24|So we're going to take an interesting look into that and see where that goes from there.
NEUT25|I.
NEUT26|Do believe one of their investors or partners got approved by the FDA to start releasing some of their products on the market.
NEUT27|Pay attention to that more and into the future.
BULL28|Hopefully it will lead to more money and more impact on that stock's price.
NEUT29|It's a GE, one of the previous stocks that had called GE is currently sitting at about 10:10, forty seven.
NEUT30|When I made the video.
NEUT31|Previous to that it was about I think 8 sending that 8 range so I'm not.
NEUT32|I'm not pulling this **** out of my ***.
NEUT33|I'm trying to give you guys some pretty good information here.
NEUT34|I'm going to continue on this stock series.
NEUT35|I like doing them.
NEUT36|It's one of my one of my favorite things to do.
NEUT37|Just got out the bike, got out on the bike today.
NEUT38|Pretty nice out, got to be about 70 degrees so winter is almost over.
NEUT39|Want to get on to that and to continue in the stocks?
NEUT40|Hopefully I can do some more interesting things for you guys.
NEUT41|Appreciate it.
NEUT42|Appreciate it everybody piece.
NEUT43|The.
NEUT44|Hell yeah they let me.
NEUT45|No.
NEUT46|Go.
NEUT47|"Close."""
