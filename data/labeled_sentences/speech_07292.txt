BULL0|"""Congressman Brady made some some comments about the the corporate tax cuts that he helped to write during the Trump administration, and he was very positive about it."
NEUT1|Do you?
BULL2|If you not acknowledge that we were starting to see before the pandemic some growth in wages at the low end, organic growth from in a very low unemployment figure, great minority employment numbers, we're seeing a lot of progress there.
BULL3|You don't think reversing that the corporate tax cuts would hurt in anyway, so it's a pleasure to be here.
NEUT4|And let's start with the fact that the end of that boom that began in 2010 was great.
BULL5|We had strong wage growth.
BULL6|We had low unemployment, but in order to continue and lay the seeds for the next generation of economic growth, America needs to reinvest in herself.
NEUT7|This type of infrastructure situation needs to be paid for look.
NEUT8|Freeways aren't free.
NEUT9|I think that's a pretty conservative principle.
NEUT10|The question is how to do that in terms of your tax argument.
BEAR11|Look, President Trump slashed corporate taxes by 40% and corporate tax revenue fell by about 40%.
BULL12|These claims that this tax cut was going to pay for itself, though it piled on more debt.
NEUT13|The corporate taxes pay about 1% of GDP in America.
NEUT14|Today in Germany, corporations pay 2%.
NEUT15|In England, they pay 3%.
BULL16|In Canada, in Japan, close to about 4% look in the Go Go 90s, where we had strong wage growth, good unemployment numbers, corporate tax figures were up at about 2% of GDP.
BEAR17|Even if President Bynes plan were enacted as proposed, you still would probably be a little bit less than 2% of GDP.
NEUT18|So so I don't see any problem.
NEUT19|In fact, to the contrary.
NEUT20|When we've had corporate taxes, actually corporations actually paying taxes at this level, the economy has been just as strong in the past.
NEUT21|Aaron's very clever.
NEUT22|I don't know whether you caught it, Erica, but the boom began in 2010, so it was sort of just the tail end it so it didn't really have anything to do with the corporate tax cut.
NEUT23|Would you raise taxes to this extent in at this point?
BULL24|Or maybe after that we've recovered more from the pandemic?
NEUT25|Erica, when would you do it, or never?
NEUT26|So I think it's important to pay for the infrastructure investments, but I think it's important to do that in a way that's not so economically damaging.
NEUT27|The corporate income tax is the most harmful tax for economic growth, and even though corporate taxes may have been high in the past across the globe, we've seen not a race to the bottom, but I raced to the mid 20s in a race to a corporate tax code that's more conducive to investment.
BULL28|Raising the corporate tax rate to 28% plus another $900 billion or so of corporate income tax hikes.
NEUT29|Will be going in the opposite direction.
BEAR30|Would be placing us at a competitive disadvantage an when we think of comparing to other countries something that's a little different in the United States is that we have a really large pass through sector and so are if you just look at corporate receipts as a percentage of GDP compared to other nations were going to look lower because so much of our businesses take the pass through form.
NEUT31|So if you if you equalize that and look at other comparisons of effective tax rates, were right now, by no means an outlier were at or above average to our OECD peers.
BEAR32|As it raising, the rate is going to be going in the wrong direction and make us an outlier.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
