NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol V IAC."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, relatively tricky chart to talk about.
NEUT5|'cause there's a couple of ways of looking at it, so let's just look at today, so nothing else.
NEUT6|Just today.
BEAR7|Individually, a bearish day, not a good day at all.
NEUT8|In fact, would be known as a gap in trap, meaning on Tuesday the price closed right there this morning, the price opened up there, hence the gap up and then after the opening Bell, the price made a little move upwards and then just totally rolled back over.
BEAR9|So gap in trap today, which is a bearish event.
NEUT10|But again, that's focus on just today when you look at multiple days that the charts hanging in there and hanging in there is being defined as staying up above.
NEUT11|That green line there which I've talked about in past videos at main level of support, which sits right around $43.30 give or take a little bit.
NEUT12|I mean, we're talking about a $40 stock, but so overall it really just depends on your game plan on your perspective.
BEAR13|Meaning if you're a day trader and you bought right there and your plan was to buy and sell within 10 minutes will then from that angle the chart looks terrible for you.
BEAR14|If you care bout things from more of a bigger picture point of view then yesterday in and of itself was absolutely annoying.
NEUT15|But it's not like everything is destroyed or anything like that.
NEUT16|Now had the price gapped up came down here and then.
NEUT17|You know, crash down through that green line.
NEUT18|OK, at that situation that would be very bearish from both looking at it today and then.
NEUT19|Also from a broader standpoint.
NEUT20|But again, that's not what happened.
NEUT21|So like I said, it goes back to, you know what was your game plan?
NEUT22|What was your angle?
NEUT23|What do you actually care about?
NEUT24|That's going to dictate you know what?
NEUT25|This chart looks like for you, but as far as just kind of the tried and true levels from the technical point of view that still hold up first, key level resistance still remains up there at 4550.
NEUT26|Sure it was broken early this morning.
BEAR27|Problem is price couldn't stay up above it and then, as already discussed right down there around 4330 is that overall area of support.
BULL28|So yeah, today not a good day, but overall the charts hanging in there.
NEUT29|So let's say this one continues to play out.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT32|But it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL35|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT42|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
