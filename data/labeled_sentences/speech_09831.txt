NEUT0|"""He saw an investors and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about Genius brands.
BULL2|Main reason why is because this stock is slowly going back up.
NEUT3|It's one of those stocks that if you guys didn't know it's been a penny stock for a very very long time.
NEUT4|But it wasn't until this summer that literally went up to as high as like almost $8.00 actually went up as high as $11.00.
NEUT5|Crazy right?
BEAR6|And then from there huge pullback in from since then.
NEUT7|It's just been a penny stock since then and there's no movement, so we're going to talk about it.
NEUT8|Is the time to buy.
NEUT9|Is it a good time to invest into this company before I continue guys we will not.

NEUT20|Here's the Apple one.
NEUT21|Pretty cool, right?
NEUT22|And here's three other stocks that I got for $100.
NEUT23|So what is so Genius brand is the time to buy.
NEUT24|If you go on the Internet search any news you will see that there are no news for genius brands.
NEUT25|But if you're new here guys don't know what Genius brand is very quickly used to explain to you guys.
NEUT26|You know it's a content and brand management company.
NEUT27|And this is the important part.
NEUT28|OK, this is what they do.
NEUT29|They develop are producing marketing, licensing, branded children's entertainment properties.
NEUT30|So if you guys don't know if you guys go to the Google Store or you know the Apple Store whatever you want to call it, you search up, you know, download the app called Genius Brands.
NEUT31|You guys will see that they have a brand.
NEUT32|Basically an app for kids to watch.
NEUT33|You know shows and they're very friendly.
NEUT34|It's just for kids and it's really cool.
NEUT35|How Genius Brand was actually doing this.
NEUT36|And this was happening like around.
BEAR37|You know when the stock was slowly going back down, which I didn't understand.
BULL38|You know it was very successful.
BEAR39|They were doing very good, but the stock was still dropping.
BEAR40|Also, we had some big investors, but that still didn't help it as well.
NEUT41|And then Genius brands slowly just started to die off.
BEAR42|Yes and see a little bit of a, you know, started to increase the $2.00 and then just dropped again.
NEUT43|But in my opinion, Genius brand is definitely one of those stocks.
NEUT44|That is, it only goes up when there's really good news.
NEUT45|You know they started working on, you know, some Stanley.
NEUT46|Entertaining a shows.
NEUT47|They also were working on like you go stuff and everything like that, so they were doing a lot of things, but from the looks of it this company we haven't heard much since then.
NEUT48|So in my opinion, Genius brand is definitely one that we should wait and see.
NEUT49|What happens.
NEUT50|Yes?
BULL51|And see that you know quarter four for 2020 won't be expected until March, but you can see that they were performing very well.
NEUT52|You know for 2020 and I'm very curious to see how they do so let me know down in the comments section below.
NEUT53|Should you buy it?
BULL54|I personally feel that right now dollar a dollar $2.00 is really good.
NEUT55|You know, usually goes up when we get good news.
NEUT56|"Once again we just have to wait for those news and I will see you guys on my next video."""
