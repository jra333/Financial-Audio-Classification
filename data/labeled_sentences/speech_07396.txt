NEUT12|Alright, Next up we have Moody's MCO is a stack symbol.
NEUT13|This is video 7 of 19 of the upgraded stock series.
NEUT14|If you want to watch from the beginning click on the link in the description down below.
NEUT15|Now first and foremost, the analyst price target on this upgrade is 337.
BEAR16|Now I can't get the stock chart up high enough to place that target so the Yahoo price target is 324.
NEUT17|I can just barely get that one in there, but let's let's throw it up there just for fun right there.
NEUT18|By target on this I believe is about 280 and will get into that in just a moment.
NEUT19|Moody's Corporation they operate as an integrated risk assessment firm worldwide.
NEUT20|They've been around forever, operates in two segments, Moody's Investors Service, Anne Moody's Analytics, the Moody's Investors Service segment publishes credit ratings and provides assessment services on various debt obligations, programs, and facilities, and entities that issue such obligations, such as various corporate financial institutions and governmental obligations, and structured finance securities.
NEUT21|They are making money.
BULL22|They're doing very well.
BULL23|Earnings per share of 99.39 PE 32 very strong.
BULL24|Taking a look at the technicals, the stock chart looks phenomenal on a long term scale.
BULL25|Just set new all term, all time highs on.
NEUT26|Thursday market was closed Friday.
NEUT27|I want to take a look a little bit closer here.
NEUT28|We've got some decent support levels here, right about 280 is my by target right where this target is and again price target on this from the analysts 337.
BULL29|So we've got a lot of upside here.
NEUT30|Stock currently trading at 306.
BEAR31|I'd be looking for a pullback here by in 290 to 280.
BULL32|Somewhere in here would be a strong buy, but I would wait for a small pullback in the stock.
NEUT33|Let me put another.
NEUT34|Target by here 290.
NEUT35|I wouldn't quibble too much though.
NEUT36|Over the pennies when you're looking at a price target on 337, that's 10%.
NEUT37|Just try to get it under 300 I think.
NEUT38|Would be very fair, but yes look for a pullback before you get in on this one.
NEUT39|This is a good stack though.
NEUT40|"Fundamentally sound will see you on the next one."""
