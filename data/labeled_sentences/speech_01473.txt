NEUT0|"""Warren Buffett isn't like most CEOs, he runs one of the few true conglomerates left in America, Berkshire Hathaway."
NEUT1|Berkshire is a massive insurance company manufacturer, railroad operator, investor and much more.
NEUT2|Buffett himself is worth about $74 billion, which makes him the 4th richest person in the world.
NEUT3|Yet he lives in Omaha, NE, not some fancy coastal mansion.
NEUT4|But one of the biggest things that sets Buffett apart is that he doesn't always play by the same rules as the other guys, and nobody really questions him.
NEUT5|There's good reason for this.
NEUT6|Buffet has delivered a nearly 2,000,000% stock price game since he took over Berkshire 50 years ago.
NEUT7|Plus, he's got this folksy image that adds to his, or of trustworthiness.
NEUT8|But Buffett turns 87 this year, and so lately there's a lot of talk about what Berkshire will be like without him.
NEUT9|You can count on one thing, the opaque culture he's created is a luxury that won't be afforded to Buffett's successor.
NEUT10|Whether that's Greg Abel or Aji Jane or some other candidate.
NEUT11|Many have been rumored over the years by Abel and Jane are seen as buffets.
NEUT12|Two favourites right now.
NEUT13|Should he ever decide to step away, though one of the first issues will be transparency.
NEUT14|Berkshire Hathaway owns all these disparate businesses, but aside from the biggest ones, shareholders really only get a high level glimpse at their performance each quarter.
NEUT15|And forget the common practice of quarterly earnings calls.
NEUT16|Buffett doesn't do those.
NEUT17|It doesn't really bother investors now, but they'll demand more from buffets replacement.
NEUT18|Another big issue will be Berkshires pile of cash.
BULL19|It sits at about $86 billion, a figure that continues to climb.
NEUT20|Buffett uses the money for acquisitions and investments at his discretion, which produce better returns than, say, paying a dividend.
NEUT21|In fact, Buffett is firmly against paying a dividend.
NEUT22|But that could be one of the first changes we see.
NEUT23|Berkshire may very well pay out some of its cash to shareholders under the next CEO to appease wary investors.
NEUT24|"It could look like a very different company in those respects, but that's not necessarily a bad thing."""
