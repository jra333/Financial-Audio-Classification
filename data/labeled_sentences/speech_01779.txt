BULL0|"""Hey guys, be prepared and welcome back to the financial experiment today."
BULL1|We're talking about Disney so I hope you're satisfied.
NEUT2|'cause if you ain't don't blame me you can blame my friends on the other side.
BEAR3|Alright, looks like Disney starting to show you guys a whole new world because for the month were down 10.58%.
NEUT4|It was doing a nice upward trend over the past couple of months but it's not business fault.
NEUT5|Let's take a look at the market as a whole right.
NEUT6|Red, Red, Red, Red is an ocean of red.
NEUT7|Let's get back to Disney.
NEUT8|So what's happening and what should your strategy be?
NEUT9|If you're looking to get into Disney?
NEUT10|Well, let me tell you what my opinion is right, and again, I'm not a financial investor.
NEUT11|This is just what I think and what I would do with my money.
NEUT12|So Disney, if you want to jump into Disney, let me tell you for me where the magic number would be, then I didn't mean to run that, but $100 the $100 range.
NEUT13|Is where I would start to invest into Disney and if it starts to fall back to the 90s and even the 80s I would very heavily start investing into Disney.
NEUT14|Everybody knows Disney is a strong company, is not going to go to business anytime soon.
NEUT15|Yes it is being heavily affected by what's happening around the world right now, but these are not games that are unrecoverable.
NEUT16|What I mean by that is that once this day opens back up.
NEUT17|They're going to go back to making the exact same gains that were making before, if not more.
BEAR18|I really don't think that once we get over this Corona situation, people are going to be afraid to go to Disney if I could go to Disney today.
NEUT19|I would go to Disney today.
NEUT20|I mean, I'll tell you this.
NEUT21|I live about 2 hours away from Disney and I've never had the desire to go to Disney.
NEUT22|I've gone a couple times 'cause my friends want to go and that's fine.
NEUT23|But ever since this lock down.
NEUT24|Man, I wish I could go to Disney.
NEUT25|I would probably pay 200, three $100 for a ticket if I could go today.
NEUT26|So what I think is going to happen is actually that once the parks open back up, there's going to be a surge of people who weren't interested before like me.
NEUT27|But now that we can't have it now we want it and once it opens, so we're going to be like man, I can't wait.
NEUT28|I've been waiting my whole life for this moment.
NEUT29|I mean honestly once.
NEUT30|Once Disney opens, I'm probably going to myself.
NEUT31|And of course the parks are not business.
NEUT32|Only source of income, right?
NEUT33|They got Disney plus which I keep subscribing and unsubscribing to just to watch a single show or a movie, but they're still taking my money plus another Disney Channel and their toys in their movies.
NEUT34|And you know, that's why I think that it may go down to the 90s.
NEUT35|I don't think it's going to go back to the $80.00 range if it does men.
NEUT36|I'm not going to buy some Disney stock.
NEUT37|Speaking of Disney stock.
