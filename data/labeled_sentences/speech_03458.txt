NEUT0|"""Yes Sir, the boy behave we back with another one."
NEUT1|Let's go ahead and get right into it.
NEUT2|You know I don't know by the time we do that music video thumbs up so I can reach more people today.
NEUT3|We touching bases on General Electric's ticker.
NEUT4|Symbol GE.
NEUT5|We're going to be seeing this GE still a buy after proposing a reverse stock split.
NEUT6|We can go in details and see about how much GEB value that after reverse stock split and the numbers and scenes in words.
NEUT7|A good buy point and check out the chart.
NEUT8|So let's look into it.
NEUT9|Yeah, we opened at 1365.
NEUT10|The high was 1374.
BULL11|Below is 1292 fifty two week high of 1442.
NEUT12|The low.
NEUT13|Was 548.
BEAR14|GE stock sinks at the proposal.
NEUT15|Reverse stock split, confirming $30 billion arcade deal.
NEUT16|GE provides 2021 financial guidance.
BULL17|A bit beat down beat on profit but in line with revenue.
NEUT18|So G will be doing a one eight verse stock split, so that would be that would be a $13.00.
BEAR19|And what's the share price $13.14 / 8 dollars so that would bring that would bring the price down to $1.75 per share.
NEUT20|And yes, after the reverse stock split G, it will be about, but we have to see how it trades afterwards and see why price points and check out the chart and follow up on it being you get what I'm saying and the reasoning why we're bringing this share price to 175 is because basically companies have reverse stock split to bring more attractive price to the public eye.
NEUT21|So for all the shareholders, if I if you got two one share of GE.
NEUT22|They give you 8 shares for one share because the price is going to be 175 and 175 times.
NEUT23|Oh how many shares I say you have 175 times.
NEUT24|I mean should I see you have daily quota which oppose the hell you feeling?
NEUT25|I'm trying to any got time for that.
NEUT26|So let's check it out.
NEUT27|Do you?
NEUT28|GE if we check out the chart see your day on the day in one day chart we hit 12,097 cents.
NEUT29|If you look back on a one month chart we hit that same 1298.
BULL30|To announce it so we got a good support right here.
BEAR31|So if we break dates within 90 days for the 97 before the split, this thing contain contain down a good bit containing back down to the nine dollar $10 range before we get back in this and but if you hold up to a 98 to 97 then it's a goodbye and it could.
NEUT32|He got a lot of the outfield or pie it would go to the 14 fifteen $16.00 range.
NEUT33|So that's all I got for this video.
NEUT34|I just want to bring that to your attention.
NEUT35|With GE you already know she would behave like this type of disease, hypertension, all that good stuff you found.
NEUT36|The right channel considered joining and we are.
BULL37|"God bless."""
