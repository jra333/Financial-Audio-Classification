NEUT0|"""Alright, whether it is global warming, trade wars, or the proliferation of artificial intelligence, the world that is a unique place as we head into the new decade."
NEUT1|So what can we expect in the twenty 20s joining us with his predictions?
NEUT2|Is futurist Nikolas badminton good to have you here?
BEAR3|You say as we look into this next decade and into the future, there are already signs that profitability for products like oil are coming to an end.
BEAR4|Listen, this is serious stuff in a country where an entire you know most of an entire province depends on the oil and gas industry.
BEAR5|You're saying that this is on the decline and all the signs are pointing in that direction.
NEUT6|Yeah, absolutely.
BULL7|There's a shift towards renewable energy in the world, and I was in Alberta yesterday and there's a number of projects in our bird around geothermal around renewable energy sources like wind, like solar that are really starting to ramp up, and that that's really going to be good for the economy of Alberta and.
NEUT8|And Canada as a whole.
NEUT9|Now in the next 10 years is going to be huge transition towards renewable energy.
NEUT10|The pressure is going to come from government, but more importantly, it's already coming from banking.
BEAR11|Mark Carney, the government, the governor of the Bank of England, says the companies that still operate with fossil fuels in the next 5 to 10 years are likely to go bankrupt.
NEUT12|We've also got 130 plus banks that control $47 trillion worth of assets in the world by the investment of assets into fossil fuel companies and companies that are in industry.
NEUT13|Take on UN principles to get people into sustainable renewable energy as well.
NEUT14|Alright, let's move on to Geo Engineering.
NEUT15|You're saying this is going to ramp up in 2020, you know, for those of us who aren't futurists, what is Geo engineering?
NEUT16|How does it work and why is this something that we're developing Laura so so the planet is going to get warmer?
BEAR17|The UN just came out, so it's going to be 3.9 degrees Centigrade warmer by 2100, and we're way off target of what we need to be.
NEUT18|So a Geo.
NEUT19|Engineering is the idea that we can cool down the planet, take CO2 out of the atmosphere.
NEUT20|There's some companies that one company out of school which called carbon engineering takes CO2 from the atmosphere and creates clean burning fuel.
NEUT21|There are researchers in Harvard thinking about putting aerosols into the atmosphere to really bring that temperature down.
NEUT22|It's incredibly controversial and no one really knows if it's going to work on scale.
NEUT23|Big experiment.
NEUT24|It's a big experiment, but it's really interesting to see some of these creative experimental new new applications of science.
NEUT25|Your last prediction is the emergence of a trillion sensor society.
NEUT26|What is that?
NEUT27|And how will it shape our future?
NEUT28|So we've everyone's got smart phones and we've got a dozen or so sensors in those smartphones is gonna be 6 billion smartphones in the world in the next year or so.
NEUT29|And then we've also got sensors in the roads in the cities, in our offices in industry, self driving cars.
NEUT30|And we're going to be surrounded by everything that's harvesting the data from from our lives.
NEUT31|Date is going to grow to about 163 zero bytes of data by 2025, as like a billion billion high definition movies and.
NEUT32|And data is going to be flying around.
NEUT33|What does this mean?
NEUT34|We're going to kind of be in a strange Chamber of corporate surveillance in a way, so we have to work out how ethically we operate as humans in their businesses really need to give us control back of our data.
NEUT35|We need to demand some of that control back of our data to absolutely we do.
NEUT36|Nicholas.
NEUT37|Badminton is always both interesting and a little frightening talking to you as we look into this next decade.
BULL38|Thanks so much for being here.
NEUT39|Thank you.
BULL40|Thanks for watching.
