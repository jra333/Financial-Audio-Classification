NEUT0|"""I like these mega caps breaking out of these bases."
NEUT1|Apple, Amazon, Google, Netflix, and video Facebook.
BEAR2|These mega caps haven't done a damn thing since the summer people are telling me that we're in a bubble too high.
NEUT3|JC too far, too fast.
NEUT4|He see you're too complacent as they told me JC, you're too much complacency is what these people are telling me.
NEUT5|I'm looking at the biggest companies on Earth or the biggest companies ever on Earth or any other planet for that matter, doing nothing.
NEUT6|Since the summer.
NEUT7|I guess I'm just not seeing what bubble these people were talking about or what sort of complacency.
NEUT8|When the biggest and most liquid stocks on planet Earth haven't done anything since August, I just I guess I just don't see this bubble that people keep pointing out or trying to point out all right?
NEUT9|Well, let's look at Apple.
NEUT10|That's the one that I that I pulled up first, and so we we, I, I see this high that we had somewhere around 137 bucks.
BULL11|We're now definitely above that high.
NEUT12|I mean, is it like in buy territory yet?
NEUT13|Or is it a little bit more wait and see to make sure it's not a fake out?
NEUT14|Where are you at with them?
NEUT15|Yeah, I think you own it.
NEUT16|I think if you're above those former highs from.
NEUT17|August, I think you could be long and strong all day.
NEUT18|You know we're looking at war like a two point $2.5 billion company or something like that.
NEUT19|I think it goes to 160.
NEUT20|Do that math.
NEUT21|Does it get it to 3 billion?
NEUT22|Three trillion?
NEUT23|Yet I don't know, but that's where I think we're going.
NEUT24|If we're above 138.
NEUT25|I like Apple long with the target of 160.
BULL26|Boom, boom.
NEUT27|There it is.
NEUT28|Alright, alright then let's pull up one more or whatever we throw at Netflix.
BULL29|I think Google Google alright.
NEUT30|Would you like the the goo or the Google?
BULL31|Good you like the guy.
NEUT32|I like the OG GOOG as well.
NEUT33|It's a stock I've owned forever.
NEUT34|I've got like some of these stocks like Apple and Google that I bought.
NEUT35|You know ten years ago and I just will never solve as my eye.
NEUT36|This curse will never sell or buy more so I don't want to screw my cost basis.
NEUT37|But alright, we got Google up on the screen.
NEUT38|Yeah, we're breaking out into these new highs to tell me about this one.
NEUT39|Same thing for above those summer highs your long it's been working.
NEUT40|I think it goes to 2260 on the Google 22 six 260.
NEUT41|Boom, there's another price target so you got Apple 160.
NEUT42|Google 2260.
NEUT43|"At at"""
