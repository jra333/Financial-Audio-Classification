NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I want anyways very impressive balance on this one.
NEUT5|When you stop, think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down here.
BULL6|Yet the price was able to fight and balance all the way back up to there.
NEUT7|Now don't get me wrong, there's still a lot of work that needs to be done, but relatively speaking from where it was at its lowest aware, the price closed.
NEUT8|Nice balance.
NEUT9|But that brings about the more than valid question of.
NEUT10|But is there any sort of true power behind this balance?
NEUT11|Is there any sort of genuine strength, or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT12|Dead Cat bounce that move and I have no idea.
NEUT13|But by using charts we can make anything that question very straightforward and in my mind or volume on this area right here at.
NEUT14|See what is that the 114 Mark wise 114 important sent all this was going to happen but just for explanation sake.
NEUT15|If the price were to come down to that level.
NEUT16|Behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT17|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT18|That would quite literally be put in the price.
NEUT19|Right back to where it was, I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, choose strength or anything like that.
NEUT20|But to be fair, no price can go straight up so maybe the price does something like this where comes down here behaved in that manner then starts to work its way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now all of a sudden what you have?
NEUT22|Well you'd have a set of laws right there, you would have lowest down there if you envision each one of those stair steps.
NEUT23|Well, hey there we go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT24|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT25|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL26|Overtime it's going to make progress forward.
NEUT27|And in this situation, quote unquote progress again, being defined right there at $1.14 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT28|As I've talked about in past videos, it is all about that purple line.
NEUT29|And once again, this morning showed exactly why I've talked about that Purple line in the past was once again rejected by that area, so keep a close eye on that current value of that purple line again, the 50.
NEUT30|Moving average is valued at right around.
NEUT31|We'll just call it one 1550, so watch that closely.
BULL32|But All in all, nice bonds today.
NEUT33|Let's see if the price can build upon the momentum moving forward.
NEUT34|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT35|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT40|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR41|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT42|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT43|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
