NEUT0|"""How to make sure your retirement savings last as long as you do?"
BULL1|Congratulations, you've saved for decades.
NEUT2|Now.
NEUT3|How do you convert your nest egg into a stream of retirement income that lasts as long as you do?
NEUT4|The simplest way is to buy an immediate annuity.
NEUT5|You give an insurance company your money and you get back an annual income for the rest of your life.
NEUT6|If, like most retirees, you'd rather hang on to most or all of your stash, then plan to spend no more than 4% of it per year with $1,000,000 saved, you can draw $40,000 of income.
NEUT7|Here are three ways to do it.
NEUT8|Build a Treasury bond ladder, buy bonds of varying maturities.
BULL9|Go out long for a high cash flow to meet your current income needs.
NEUT10|Then when you're in your late 80s and 90s, start selling off bonds at maturity to live off of the principle.
NEUT11|Combined dividends and stock sales.
NEUT12|If you're ready to take more risk by the whole stock market with a low cost index fund, collect 2% in dividends a year and sell some appreciated shares each year by high dividend stocks.
NEUT13|A portfolio or fund made up of high dividend stocks can yield 4%.
BULL14|"Just don't expect as much growth."""
