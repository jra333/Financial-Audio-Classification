BEAR0|"""Four guys are last month."
NEUT1|We talk about the fidelity's prediction.
NEUT2|About me Stark reaching $900 per share, but this prediction is not so fascinating because the latest prediction for AMC stock price from Fidelity.
NEUT3|It's Air Canada hours by October.
NEUT4|Check out the graph on the screen.
BULL5|You will see that the predictions are starting to rise up around may May.
NEUT6|The stock price should be between 1:50 and $200 in June.
NEUT7|The price should be around $300.
BULL8|In July, the price should hit the levels around $500 Aug 600, September 700 an all the way back to October.
NEUT9|The stock price offenses should hit around $800 per share.
NEUT10|Understand for a lot of you $800 price target for MC is great, but that's not fascinating simply because the previous prediction.
NEUT11|I made a video of MC the last month was $900, so this is around 100 hours.
BEAR12|Decrease in the price target for MC for next couple of months and why is that right?
BEAR13|Why we saw the decrease of $100 per share of the stock price target?
NEUT14|The current implied volatility has changed a lot.
BULL15|As of now, the implied volatility for AMC stock options is 61.56% in comparison with the historic average volatility of 167% for the stock.
NEUT16|And remember a couple of days ago I made a video about unusual options activity on AMC stock.
NEUT17|With the stock but the strike price around $22.00 per share so.
NEUT18|People are definitely betting that the stock price will be at least 20 hours per sure around September because the Co options and activity of strike price $2122 for sure it's quite strong.
NEUT19|And remember these predictions that we saw from Fidelity, the first one, and this is the current one is not calculating is not taking into account the whole market manipulation is not taking into account all the dark flow, all the counterfeited shares is not taking into account.
NEUT20|A short squeeze taking place.
NEUT21|We cannot actually see how accurate their predictions are, but we can definitely say that this is not the whole story, right?
NEUT22|Because if you not take into consideration into the whole formula, all the elements on the market, all the manipulations, all the things that actually try to break the short squeeze.
BEAR23|So guys, I think we definitely can agree on this that the stock price is not going to be even near their prediction.
NEUT24|There are many factors that they're missing factors that we are aware of and factor that we definitely want to.
NEUT25|Follow up with so.
NEUT26|Definitely there is no place for panic on the market, especially if your MC shareholder.
NEUT27|If you're having a short position against MC, well, maybe you should panic, right?
NEUT28|Becauses certain point, you will be in the position in which you have to buy back and return the shares to the brokerage, right?
NEUT29|So guys, let me know in the comments section what do you think about this Fidelity price prediction by October?
NEUT30|Do you think it's realistic to think that we can go even higher?
NEUT31|What is the number that you want to see?
