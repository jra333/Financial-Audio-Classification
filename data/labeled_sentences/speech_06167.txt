NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Glenn this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Very nice movement here for Amazon.
NEUT5|I mean I don't mean to state the obvious when you state the OR when you think about the fact that just on Thursday the price was down here and now it's worked its way all the way up to where it has.
NEUT6|Like I said, that's that's a very nice move, but it does bring about the valid question of.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of true power behind this woman?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat Bounce, site move and I have no idea.
NEUT10|But by using charge we can make answering that question going into next week very straightforward.
NEUT11|In my mind, it all rolls around a single area and that is this area down here at the 3160 Mark Wise 3160 import and I'm not saying that this was going to happen, but just for explanation saying if the price were to come down to that area, behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT12|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT13|That would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out.
NEUT14|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price moves like go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT15|But to be fair, no, pricing goes straight up so maybe the price would come down here.
NEUT16|Behave in that manner then starts to work way back upwards.
NEUT17|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here, you have lows down here.
NEUT18|If you envision each of those stair steps, well, there you go.
NEUT19|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT20|And again, that's the name the game.
NEUT21|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL22|It's going to make progress forward.
NEUT23|And in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 3160 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT24|First key battleground to watch very closely headed into.
NEUT25|Monday going to be right up there at, let's call it 3208 so 3208, give or take is going to be the first level to watch and if the price can get the breakthrough there and that's just going to make this bounce look that much stronger.
NEUT26|So a lot of eyeballs will be watching that area moving forward.
BULL27|But All in all, fantastic movement today.
NEUT28|Not just a question of Canada price continue to build upon this balance next week.
NEUT29|Let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT32|But it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT41|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT42|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box.
NEUT43|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.

NEUT45|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
