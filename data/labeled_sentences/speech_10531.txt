NEUT1|Separately, the agency allowing Pfizer to store its code vaccine at normal freezer temperatures for up to two weeks.
NEUT2|Jim, the expectation is, given that what we saw, but of course we gotta wait an I'll rely on make torreilles reporting is always that it will be approved.
NEUT3|And well, I think it's 20 million doses.
NEUT4|As soon as what maybe 30 working with emergent Bio.
NEUT5|That which has this Maryland facility is pumping amount David.
NEUT6|Here's something that's been odd about this.
NEUT7|Yeah, every time there's an approval.
NEUT8|We all kind of know there's going to be approval.
NEUT9|And yet the stock jumps like J&J it could run to one 65166, right?
NEUT10|Unknown news, David.

NEUT17|Turner, what they've done an yet guys give me a 20 year Pfizer 'cause I love to just get your thoughts on that gym.
NEUT18|They had a lot of CEOs there.
NEUT19|In fact if you add up the compensation of the CEO's at Pfizer over the last 1020 years, you're talking billions right, not millions.
NEUT20|Well, there is start with a B1 and Oh my God, it's back to what's best.

NEUT31|I don't know.
NEUT32|I'm just saying that when you see a fabulous company like that not generating, they've done a lot of things.
NEUT33|You know that they've been shuffling the deck.
NEUT34|They've been moving things around, right?
NEUT35|But what they need is growth.
BULL36|They do, but they've participated in one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs that we've had, and it juked up.
NEUT37|And then it came right back down.
NEUT38|Now, Doctor Gottlieb said to me, over and over again as I've been saying, how can they suddenly realize that it doesn't have to be refrigerated?
NEUT39|Something that border Pfizer and I would, you know, he just listen Jim.
