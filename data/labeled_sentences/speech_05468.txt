BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alexandra and I want to talk about all Riley today and if I had an editor I would have totally played The O'Reilly Jingle.
BULL2|But you're welcome.
NEUT3|Also, it's stuck in your head now anyway, So what they do is they make auto parts current stock price $458.52 which gives the market cap of $32.3 billion revenue $11.6 billion earnings $1.8 billion certainly.
BULL4|Decent growth there, but nothing overwhelming that gives them PE of 18 with a forward PE of slightly over 18.5.
BULL5|Obviously not bad.
NEUT6|Dividend is zero.
NEUT7|I don't expect that to change ever total assets $11.6 billion, total liabilities $11.5 billion and that gives them an amazing stockholders equity of $140 million.
NEUT8|Which is.
NEUT9|Almost literally nothing.
NEUT10|Which is done for $400 million, which is also almost literally nothing.
NEUT11|For a company with a market cap of $32 billion, that's kinda not enough.
NEUT12|I really hate this balance sheet, but you know, if you if you watched my videos awhile, you probably know that risk factor is Amazon Walmart, the usual suspects in the next 10 years?
NEUT13|I expect most cars to be sold to be electric and so that is going to be a risk factor, but not soon.
BEAR14|Obviously older gas cars need more maintenance and for the foreseeable future there's going to be.
NEUT15|More not less.
NEUT16|Used gas cars on the market, and so I expect the growth to continue for about another decade before kind of falling off a Cliff, but.
NEUT17|For that reason alone, I probably wouldn't invest in this company ever.
BEAR18|Also, I really hate this balance sheet, so definitely not going to happen.
NEUT19|So for a growth investor, obviously the growth is definitely not enough for a dividend investor.
BEAR20|There is nothing, and for a value investor I hate this balance sheet so much just so much.
NEUT21|But the P is decent, earnings growth is decent, so if you can look past this.
NEUT22|Awful balance sheet, then by all means have a look at it.
NEUT23|Yeah, have a deeper look at it.
NEUT24|See if there's something you like.
BULL25|For for me, it's definitely enough.
NEUT26|That's it for me.
NEUT27|For today.
