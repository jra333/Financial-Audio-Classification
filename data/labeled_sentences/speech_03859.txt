NEUT0|"""How the stock market can turn on a dime?"
NEUT1|I'm Bob Stokes with Elliott Wave International.
NEUT2|An investor should never become comfortable with the stock market.
NEUT3|The bottom can drop out in the blink of an eye.
NEUT4|Financial history teaches valuable lessons, but I'm not talking about an example or two from long ago.
NEUT5|I'm talking about 2019.
BEAR6|Here's a chart and commentary from the August alleyway theorist, the Argentinian stock market, as represented by the S&P Merval index, plunged 38%.
BEAR7|You heard that right, it dropped by nearly.
NEUT8|Two fists in the blink of an eye.
BEAR9|The plunge in Argentinian assets is a warning to global investors that financial values today are precarious.
BEAR10|This was the second worst single day stock market plunge anywhere since 1950, according to Reuters.
NEUT11|As the chart notes, that occur from an all time high.
NEUT12|With that in mind, one can't help but think about the longer than 10 year bull market in U.S. stocks.
NEUT13|The longest in history and this sample headline from October 28th, S&P 500 hits.
BULL14|All time high.
BEAR15|Of course U.S. stocks have hit and many other all time highs in the course of its longest bull market in history and the main indexes have not seen a one day 38% plunge.
NEUT16|However, keep in mind that the patterns of investor psychology are the same everywhere around the globe and what happened in Argentina can happen anywhere.
NEUT17|Of course some stock market moves might be more or less dramatic than others.
NEUT18|The beauty of the Elliott Wave model is that it reflects these repetitive patterns.
NEUT19|And because these patterns do repeat, they are predictable.
NEUT20|Now is the time to learn what our Elliott wave experts anticipate next for the S&P 500 index.
