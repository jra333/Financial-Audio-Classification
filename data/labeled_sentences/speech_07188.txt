NEUT0|"""I want to go back to Peter for a second."
NEUT1|I know you're an economist, but I want you to look at the market for a second.
NEUT2|Is there any reason to think that we're going to take a pause at 2526 thousand?
NEUT3|Well, markets are driven by psychology, so we could always have a pause or even a correction, but the fundamentals are very strong.
NEUT4|As of Friday, we tally these things on a weekly basis.
BEAR5|The price earnings ratio on the S&P was actually 10% lower than a year ago.
BULL6|Not only is the earnings rally been been supported by earnings, as opposed to, you know, some sort of bubble.
NEUT7|But it's actually behind earnings.
BULL8|There's every reason to believe that the stock market between now and June should pick up another 2010 to 20% in valuation.
NEUT9|If it's to keep up with just the historical average.
NEUT10|Historically, the SNP over 25 years, the price earnings ratio is 25.
NEUT11|Right now.
NEUT12|It's below that.
BULL13|FactSet is estimating profits will grow about another 10% this quarter.
NEUT14|So my feeling is it's all there.
BULL15|Given the tax cut and so forth, 10 to 20% easy.
NEUT16|Alright Peter, I know you gotta go back to the University, got to teach those kids capitalism, and we appreciate that so.
BULL17|On your way, and do a good job please.
NEUT18|"Peter Marie, see everybody he'll be back soon back to you."""
