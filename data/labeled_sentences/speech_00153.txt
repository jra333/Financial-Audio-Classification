BULL0|"""Alright, hello everyone."
NEUT1|Stuck Master back here with another video for you all before we start.
NEUT2|If you're new to the channel this describe right now, go to the community we are currently on our way to 300 subscribers an onwards like this video and share if you enjoy the content today topic is oggi.
NEUT3|This stock was put onto my radar by buddy this morning so I decided to do some quick research on it.
NEUT4|You don't want to miss out any of the information I have to share with you all.
NEUT5|Watch the whole video.
NEUT6|Let's get to it.
NEUT7|First off.
NEUT8|OG is a cannabis company that was founded in 2013.
NEUT9|The current President stock is $6 in the market cap is 1.39 billion.
NEUT10|The revenue is currently not generating any positive revenue, but don't get discouraged by this because I think Oggi has quite a bit of potential in growth.
NEUT11|I want to quickly mention that the current US administration actually benefits the cannabis industry.
NEUT12|Other plans I have read up on says that the government is trying to legalize it federally.
NEUT13|This will leave it up to states to legalize weed legalized cannabis.
NEUT14|Smart market strategy would be to legalize it.
NEUT15|Any of the profit for the state, plus it costs a lot of money to process person that's being charged with cannabis.
NEUT16|Therefore, I think that eventually cannabis could be legalized in every state.
NEUT17|Some people have asked me if we are currently in the cannabis bubble past few days.
BULL18|If you compare OG with other cannabis stocks they all have been rising.
NEUT19|Maybe we are in accountable, or maybe these thoughts are just growing because investors are interested.
NEUT20|One thing for sure, if you believe that a company will grow, don't miss.
NEUT21|Out, do you DD an investing risk given the train before it takes off?
BULL22|Although Oggi isn't making profit after revenue versus expenses, they did show increase in every sector of the company revenue in 2020.
BULL23|This looks good for the company and the company continues to grow.
NEUT24|It will be a good investment for investors as an unbiased reviewer I would like to mention that article headline like this worries me.
NEUT25|Maybe read a crowd had turned to Canada stock or maybe this just all speculations but one thing for sure.
NEUT26|Make sure to set your stop loss limit anti profit when you can because just like AMC Angie, me you come crashing down once the hype is over or once people start panic selling and you don't want to be the person holding the bag at the end for a loss, I would like to mention that there is currently a leadership change for oggi.
NEUT27|This could be good or bad.
NEUT28|Only time will tell my personal opinion on OG I my personal opinion in my bullish or bearish.
BULL29|I'm actually bullish on the stock for the price entry.
NEUT30|I don't really have.
NEUT31|Recipe for this talk.
BEAR32|I got him pretty late when the stock was around 5:50 to $6 and therefore I think that that's kind of high because it has been rising the past few days.
NEUT33|Yet I believe this stock has a lot of potential, and I did my research on the company and I believe that they have room for growth and therefore that's why I invested a small portion of My Portfolio.
NEUT34|So do you DD, an investing risk if you made it this far into the video?
