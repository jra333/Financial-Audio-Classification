NEUT0|"""Hi everyone and welcome to the first video of my stock portfolio creation."
NEUT1|So the first stock that I have added to this portfolio is Coca Cola which is ticker KO.
NEUT2|Coca Cola is traded on the New York Stock Exchange and is an example of a consumer discretionary product.
NEUT3|So I bought this stuck on the 18th of May 2020.
NEUT4|I paid $44.87 per share and I bought 15 shares so my total first investment in Cork has come to $673.04.
NEUT5|So as you can see from the monthly six month and year today charts, the stock has went from highs of $60.00 per share and it is now currently trading in the low 40s, I believe because Coke is such a trade and has a product over the years that knows great empty boy, especially at the current price.
NEUT6|So Cork pays a 3.79% dividend which is paid quarterly and that equates to $0.41 per quarter per sure you wanna Coke.
NEUT7|So as you can see the Coca Cola Company is an American multinational beverage Corporation.
NEUT8|It's located in Georgia.
NEUT9|The Coca Cola Company's interest in manufacturing, retailing and marketing of non alcoholic beverages.
NEUT10|With over 130 years in business and product offerings in over 200 countries, it is no surprise corkers or 500 plus brands worldwide offering over 800 plus drink varieties in the US alone.
NEUT11|One of the main reasons where like the Coke Cola share is because they have a very wide and diversified product offering in the drinks industry.
NEUT12|Their brands ranging from smart water.
NEUT13|The Costa Coffee Powerade to innocent smoothies and even Schwipps defender.
NEUT14|Anytime my research, what stocks to buy wanted to main things.
NEUT15|They always look for is their key shareholders.
NEUT16|Anytime I see such companies as Berkshire Hathaway owning nearly 10% of the stock it straight away grabs my attention with a 9.31% interest stake in the company.
NEUT17|Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett have over 400,000 shares then have companies like Vanguard with a stake of 7.16% in the company.
NEUT18|Play Black Rock with 4.44%.
BEAR19|So after seeing all that, I feel that Coca Cola share is undervalued.
NEUT20|I'm going to be employing a buy and hold approach, adding additional Cork shares My Portfolio when I feel the time is right.
BULL21|I feel that in the coming year or so, called share price will continue to rise and with a dividend of 3.79% paid annually, I will certainly be looking at a lot more shares of Corp into My Portfolio in the coming months.
NEUT22|So after seeing all that, I'd be very interested to know what your views are.
BEAR23|Under current Coca Cola share price, do you think the stock is over or undervalued?
NEUT24|And also, do you have Holdings of Cork in your own portfolio?
NEUT25|Thanks very much for watching as always and please stay tuned for the second video in which I will share my next stock that I've added to My Portfolio.
BULL26|"Thanks again and I'll see you in the next video."""
