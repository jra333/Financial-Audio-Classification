NEUT0|"""King here at the Apple stock and I was looking carefully here to see kind of where I think our next support is and I drew this blue line yesterday as a line that if you look at the recent chart here, I have my 15 minute chart so each candle represents 15 minutes."
NEUT1|I drew this out yesterday.
NEUT2|Notice that seemed like it hit this line several times as resistance.
NEUT3|Basically we have once, twice 3/4 and then we had it 5 and it was actually a resistance line and then yesterday it acted like support line so we had a good bounce here.
BEAR4|And now we're actually down for today.
NEUT5|But what also has me interested is the fact that we have this intersection of this blue line and we also have the 50 day support, so I can see this as a bottom for Apple today around the 112, sixty 70 range, and I'll probably buy a bunch of calls up up in the one 1750 or 115 range when we get down here and we should see a good bounce.
BULL6|"Maybe some consolidation this week."""
