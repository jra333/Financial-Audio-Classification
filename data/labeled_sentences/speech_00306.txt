NEUT0|"""Brian Sozzi, known internally as the retail undertaker."
BEAR1|I'm sure we'll get some negative retail news in this segment, but Brian, we don't.
BULL2|We do want to talk about some good news that we're getting from retailers.
NEUT3|We got a big retail conference going on this week.
BULL4|ICR conference in a number of companies coming out with either firm or sort of soft guidance or results as they get ready to present here and the numbers have been pretty good.
BULL5|Yeah, I just want to say for the record though, I'm a sunny, cheery, happy, do and ever since Julia Gaming that that nickname last week I've been fending off a lot of emails of people asking me if I'm in fact OK, yes, I am.
NEUT6|But to your question a lot.
BULL7|OK, it's all good and I appreciate the appreciate the nickname.
BULL8|Anyway, some positive retail sales numbers the week started off with Little Lemon guys coming out yesterday morning and saying that their sales are going to be for the fourth quarter at the high end expectations and that just opened the floodgate as a lot of these executives present at the ICR Consumer Conference Boot Barn, maker of Cowboy and Cowgirl boots.
BULL9|They came out and said same store sales of 4.6%, CEO Jim Conroy said January or the fourth quarter is off to a strong start.
NEUT10|I guess a lot of people are taking their stimulus checks and going out and buying cowboy and cowboy cowgirl boots to use in their at home gym workouts.
NEUT11|Next up Genesco, he should wear retailer.
NEUT12|Not necessarily a great fourth quarter.
BEAR13|Same store sales were down 14% but they said that sales so far in this month are looking good and then last but not least you had zoomies same store sales for 10 weeks ended in December of 1.7%.
BULL14|They said same store sales in January get this are up double digits and what's?
NEUT15|Interesting about all of these things and that these stocks are really going through the roof on these results in telling you that a lot of investors are not positioned for this retail rebound also too.
NEUT16|Let's also keep this in mind.
BULL17|Yet Bed Bath beyond CEO Mark trying come on our network last Friday and say guys sales in January quote looking good since he said that Bed Bath and beyond.
BULL18|Shares are up close to 9%.
NEUT19|So it's almost as if the investors want to get in here and then buy some of these stocks.
BULL20|Yeah Brian, you make a really good point.
NEUT21|I think with the.
NEUT22|Exception lululemon that these stocks are really contrary to the rest of the market in that the valuations are not as high.
NEUT23|The expectations are not as high.
NEUT24|So then when they do B, obviously, as you can see from the action, there's more room for upside.
NEUT25|Yeah, so about the cowboy boots, right?
NEUT26|Apparently I I love doing burpees in cowboy boots.
NEUT27|Nothing really you can you get that good?
BULL28|You told me that good bounce.
NEUT29|You get that good balance on the way back.
NEUT30|Yeah, little jump, it's the perfect person.
NEUT31|"Perfect piece of footwear to pair with that kind of workout."""
