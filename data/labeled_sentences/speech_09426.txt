BULL0|"""Hi guys and welcome to my channel, the place for new and beginning investors."
NEUT1|If you're new here don't forget to subscribe as I have more investment related content planned which you do not want to miss out on.
NEUT2|Dividend series is a new series of decided to start where I will be analyzing a random dividend stock.
NEUT3|In this video I will be analyzing dividend stock, Cisco Systems, ticker symbol, Csco.
NEUT4|Cisco develops manufacturers and sells networking, hardware software, telecommunications equipment and.
NEUT5|Other high tech services and products.
NEUT6|They are based in Silicon Valley, the home of Tech.
BULL7|The company has recently merged with Associa Communications ticker symbol ACIA which provides a great long term outlook for the company or so let's go over their financials.
NEUT8|Their market cap is 189.18 billion.
NEUT9|Their PE ratio is 18.18 and their dividend yield is 3.22%.
NEUT10|Which is a mild dividend stock.
BULL11|Their five year dividend growth is 11.76%, which is really good.
NEUT12|Their net income as a percentage of revenue is 21.76%.
BULL13|They also have a strong balance sheet and their cash flow from operations is solid.
NEUT14|What I like the most about Cisco's dividend safety is the net cash position on the balance sheet.
NEUT15|Total debt was over 15 billion U.S. dollars at the end of financial year 2020.
BEAR16|This was offset by over 29 billion in cash equivalents and short term investments.
BULL17|The net cash position means that the dividend is probably safe even if COVID-19 hits the top and bottom lines in financial year 2021.
BEAR18|So in terms of their share price, their 52 week low is 32.40 U.S. dollars and their 52 week high is 50.28 U.S. dollars.
BULL19|Over the past five years the share price has shown an increase of a whopping 88.19%.
BEAR20|The last one year has shown decrease of 8.63%, which I believe is in no doubt partly due to the pandemic.
BULL21|The past six months has shown an increase of.
BULL22|5.57% so he is slowly recovering.
BULL23|It did show a dip around the end of October, so that would have been a good buying opportunity as it has been recovering well since then.
NEUT24|The analyst Ray in is currently sitting between a boy and a hold.
NEUT25|They have a unless price target of 48.78 U.S. dollars.
BEAR26|Its current price is 44.77 so that's a potential nine percent upside.
BEAR27|Interestingly, it's also considered undervalued according to Yahoo Finance.
BULL28|Cisco's main competitive advantage is its brand long term customer relationships, hardware market dominance, and as previously mentioned, their balance sheet.
BULL29|The company is positioned as a one stop solution for networking requirements, which is unlike most of its peers.
BULL30|Therefore, I would consider this a safe dividend investment or do not currently have this stock in My Portfolio, but it is a great dividend growth stock and one you can add for stable growth overtime.
BULL31|Whilst providing you consistent money in the form of dividends, I hope that's giving you a good insight into the stock.
