NEUT0|"""Historic Facebook IPO was only a week away, so should you buy in cbsmoneywatch.com's editor at large Jill Schlesinger is here to tell us whether it's worth your money."
NEUT1|So when Facebook goes public, who gets to buy?
NEUT2|And here's how it breaks down.
NEUT3|Now, normally 85% of a new offering is distributed to big institutional investors, mutual funds, pension funds, hedge funds.
NEUT4|They are the largest clients of the major Wall Street banks and so those banks that manage the IPO get the most shares.
NEUT5|Only about 15% of IPO's go to regular.
NEUT6|Old investors like you and me and usually only those people who have really big accounts.
NEUT7|But here's something interesting last week Facebook said on line trading from E trade would sell shares to the public that led some to speculate that maybe a higher percentage of the offering could go to retail investors.
NEUT8|Now let's just having an E trade account or any other brokers from does not guarantee that you will get the IPO or at that price it's going to be really hard to grab a piece of that.
NEUT9|Action alright, but still, even if you could buy in, should you buy it, you know it's funny.
NEUT10|Rob just said Warren Buffett doesn't want to buy him.
NEUT11|Why should I?
BEAR12|I will tell you that research shows that IPO performance has been pretty spotty, so when they become public, these new stocks tend to underperform the overall market by nearly get this one.
BEAR13|Third in the three years after going public and half of the companies actually get written negative returns, I know what you're thinking.
NEUT14|Facebook is going to be different.
BEAR15|It's going to be like Google and I'm going to miss it, and that's going to stink.
NEUT16|Then again, it could flame out again.
NEUT17|My advice, if you want a piece of the action, you may be better off buying a no load index fund.
NEUT18|That will include Facebook.
NEUT19|That's the kind of an easier way to get it on moneywatch.com.
NEUT20|We have five questions investors should ask about Facebook.
NEUT21|How about that?
NEUT22|You know, I'm no expert, that's why you're here, obviously.
BEAR23|Yeah, I just have a gut feeling this thing is overvalued.
NEUT24|I don't get it.
NEUT25|Yeah, it's $100 billion valuation right now.
NEUT26|It's hard to imagine.
NEUT27|But you know what?
NEUT28|They got 900,000,000 users.
NEUT29|OK, an I just read a research report that said.
BULL30|They they really positive Facebook could become the most valuable company listed on the exchange within five years.
NEUT31|I'm not saying it will be, I'm just saying it could be.
NEUT32|How do they make money ads so they sell ads and they sell information and they really gather that information and they want to, you know 12% volunteer at exactly and games 12% in games.
NEUT33|If you can imagine so they make a lot of money alright?
BULL34|"Well thanks so much."""
