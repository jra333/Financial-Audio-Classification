NEUT0|"""Why are the Canadian cannabis stocks up so much more than the US ones when the positive developments on regulation has been here, not in Canada?"
NEUT1|You said it so well, I think it's really a function of liquidity and an access to the investment.
BEAR2|the US operators trade on junior exchanges in Canada, which makes it harder for retail investors.
NEUT3|Democrats and control the Senate.
BULL4|There's this hope that that will lead to full legalization.
NEUT5|When do you see that happening?
NEUT6|Is there a timeline in place?
NEUT7|We're not looking for full legalization that we are looking for incremental progress under the 117th Congress.
NEUT8|What we're looking for is a modified version of a piece of legislation that was proposed last term called the States Act, which really just kind of pushes down rulemaking to the states that would have material implications.
NEUT9|Though for the US publicly listed operators, we think it would change the tax code in a very beneficial way by eliminating 280 Y.
BULL10|We think it would provide access to commercial banking and insurance, and we do think it would.
NEUT11|Allow for re listing on to the US exchanges.
NEUT12|That's interesting because without full legalizing full federal legalization, the financing tools for these companies, it really limited, right?
NEUT13|They have to go to the debt market.
BULL14|Curaleaf had a deficit Lee just yesterday or yield of 19%.
BULL15|We've also seen more specs in the marijuana space.
NEUT16|Do you see that continuing?
BULL17|I mean the cost of capital does remain high, which is one of the key benefits to the operators for the safe banking component of the States Act.
NEUT18|And also, you know, remind your viewers that there is a separate piece of legislation.
NEUT19|The Safe Banking Act that did pass the house a couple of times last year, though we would hope to see bigger progress in the 117th Congress.
BULL20|You've seen an improvement in accounting for these cannabis stocks.
NEUT21|I know that was the initial concern when they first came to market.
NEUT22|Which one is your topic here?
NEUT23|Our favorite ideas.
NEUT24|Green Thumb industries there.
BULL25|US multi state operator operating in a dozen states with roughly 50 operating dispensaries that they have a best in class.
NEUT26|Profit margin 32% adjusted EBIT margin last quarter until Ray we know it was a big conversation topic on on Reddit seems to have cooled off at least last time I looked at wallstreetbets, but how big of a role is that playing in the stock?
NEUT27|Well, I think you know broadly it's a good opportunity to remind everybody that cannabis investing is not for the faint of heart and volatility is nothing new in this industry.
NEUT28|Certainly isn't will leave the conversation there.
BULL29|Vivian, good to see you.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT31|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
