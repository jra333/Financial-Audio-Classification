NEUT0|"""Hello Guys Mirage Tower minimalist investing back at you with another video."
NEUT1|Today's video.
NEUT2|We will be talking about Berkshire Hathaway Class B, currently trading for $183 Berkshire Hathaway is a pretty decent company with a market cap of 441.1 billion and I want to talk to you guys about this company because there's a lot of things that sometimes people misunderstand with it.
NEUT3|The only thing they really associate with this company is that Warren Buffett's company.
BEAR4|Berkshire Hathaway, just so you guys know little bit about it currently right now, Scherzer off its high of $230.
NEUT5|And if we go to their financials, will see that in 2019 Berkshire posted 254.6 billion in revenues and you can see that there are segments they plan.
BEAR6|Is insurance railway, Berkshire Hathaway, Energy Manufacturing, McLane Company service and retailing, investing and derivative gains losses.
NEUT7|This is actually there.
NEUT8|Individual companies such as Apple Bank of America, Coca Cola.
NEUT9|So if we go over here just Seeking Alpha, will see that their cash on hand is a record 137 billion and we will see that their total debt is $104 billion.
NEUT10|If you go over you can see that the short term debt is 3.56 billion and the long term is 100 billion free cash flow.
NEUT11|It says it's 1.75 billion.
NEUT12|We go to their full balance sheet.
NEUT13|You'll currently see that total current assets is sitting at 196.
NEUT14|Billion dollars as of their last report and we will see that their total assets is $760 billion.
NEUT15|So it took a hit.
NEUT16|But we all know why their current liabilities is 98 billion and their total liabilities is 385 billion.
NEUT17|So it looks like they have more than enough total assets to cover total liabilities more than enough current assets to cover the current asset liability.
NEUT18|Now if we go to this.
BULL19|Chart will see that their free cash flow has been steadily increasing in 2015, it was 15.4 billion to currently as of 2019, we're seeing $22 billion in cash free cash flow.
BULL20|This is pretty good in my opinion.
NEUT21|I think this is great and that's why I think in the long term their debt is definitely not an issue.
NEUT22|I think they have it under management.
BULL23|I think Berkshire Hathaway is a very interesting purchase at this price range.
BULL24|I think it could be an even better price range at $160.00, but that's not guaranteed.
BEAR25|So for those of you who are thinking about buying Berkshire Hathaway stock, you know you could dip.
NEUT26|Photos and a little bit here, and if it goes to 160 or 155, that's just icing on top.
NEUT27|Or else you could be risking missing out on it.
NEUT28|So that's my opinion about Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL29|I think it's a great company.
NEUT30|I personally own it, and I think that there's still profits to be had.
NEUT31|Only one thing, I really don't like about Berkshire Hathaway is that it doesn't pay a dividend, but we all we all know that all Berkshire Hathaway investors know that, and that's why I'm going to be planning on selling my Berkshire stake at 230.
NEUT32|Make my capital appreciation and move on.
NEUT33|Anyways guys, thank you for watching the video.
