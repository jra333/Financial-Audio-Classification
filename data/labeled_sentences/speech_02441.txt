NEUT1|Thursday, October 3rd, 2013.
NEUT2|We're looking at Disney.
NEUT3|On the daily chart.
BEAR4|And yes, Disney is at a low on relative strength to statics.
NEUT5|Still Chassix low looks like it's going to pop up.
NEUT6|But however, let's take a look at our moving net, or four day moving average.
NEUT7|Look at this, it's below the green line so that green line.
NEUT8|We've got a full bar below the green line.
NEUT9|If that happens one more time.
NEUT10|Hopefully tomorrow.
BEAR11|Then Disney will be a short sell.
NEUT12|And let's take a look at our weekly.
NEUT13|Disney tried to go up once.
NEUT14|Twice.
NEUT15|Three times.
NEUT16|Four times still can't make it above that line.
NEUT17|That tells me.
NEUT18|That it's going to start coming down.
NEUT19|"And I'd give it another week and a half two weeks, and then it would be a short sell."""
