NEUT0|"""Jon Hilsenrath your first reaction to this."
BEAR1|This is a blockbuster number in terms of the wage gains much better than expected, and also 300 and 12,000 jobs added 300 and 12,000.
NEUT2|Yet.
NEUT3|The first word that popped into my head was eye popping.
NEUT4|I mean 300 and 12,000 everyone's talking about is slow down and 300 and 12,000.
BULL5|That's a really strong number.
NEUT6|I wonder if there might be something flaky in here but, but if there if there isn't, this is an economy that was going.
BULL7|Plenty strong going into the end it would float.
BEAR8|Would Flake eBay to push back.
NEUT9|I just curious what you mean by that.
NEUT10|Like what could be in there?
BEAR11|That's weird.
NEUT12|No, I don't.
BEAR13|I don't know, but you know, an unemployment rate going up to 10.
NEUT14|Seven percent.
NEUT15|Who knows what kind of shifts are going on in some of those numbers.
NEUT16|And you know, just when that payroll number is so much above consensus, you have to.
NEUT17|I mean, the honest answer is I don't know what would be flaky, but I just want to learn more about the numbers before.
BEAR18|Declaring the job market was so robust at the end of the year, 'cause that's that's a really strong number 'cause the factory jobs look terrific.
NEUT19|Quite everything.
BULL20|Combining factory everything 32,000 December factory jobs added goods producing 74,000 construction in the month of December was up 38,000 jobs again across the board and the strength.
NEUT21|It's interesting and I want to get everybody in here, but 301 thousand jobs in the private sector.
NEUT22|"That really is a follow on to the ADP report that we got."""
