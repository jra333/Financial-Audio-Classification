BEAR0|"""That's an unusual cause by many standards."
NEUT1|But now let's talk about stuff which is considered more conventional.
NEUT2|Well, the MBA life is usually about a long lectures.
NEUT3|A lot of case studies are of course a lot of learning.
NEUT4|While you have fun.
NEUT5|So we decided to indulge in some fun ourselves.
NEUT6|Let's take a look at what exactly happened at SP Jain, ZAR annual Festival, lock, stock and trade.
NEUT7|17 companies, 11 participating colleges and 296 student investors experiencing the Bull run an exciting activity for any MBA, student lock, stock and trade is an annual event at the SCG Institute of Management Studies and Research where a team of three students associates with the company, which is the company to students, investors and the student investors intern bid for the best company.
NEUT8|Of course, the company, with the maximum number of bids wins.
NEUT9|How exactly the students investors?
NEUT10|Exactly the companies and how do students sell their companies?
NEUT11|That's what I wanted to find out.
NEUT12|Right back with you with the first year and today is gonna probably.
NEUT13|OK, may have gone for 5:25.
BULL14|We have a very great client base comprising of big names like code got a modded, Monica Lewinsky and we have been consistently back in repeat order.
NEUT15|If a student investor needed more convincing, they could also watch the detailed presentations of the companies before finally deciding on whom to invest their money.
BEAR16|Lost profit margin of 17% and net profit or three point 4% in our industry like this, margins are pretty low because it's manufacturing, but the industry and our company is extremely stable and that's what's required.
NEUT17|With the presentations and the bids made, we were all waiting for the results just the right time to find out from a B school student about what they pick up at an event like this one.
NEUT18|How do you think an event like this helps Foster the spirit of entrepreneurship?
NEUT19|A lot of people here have some thoughts or some dreams, but they are hesitant to take the ultimate step that is just do something.
NEUT20|So here's when people haven't even invested in stock markets and you are propelling them to invest it here like to experiment themselves to see so many people and to see that people of your age or probably less than your age, have successful firms.
BULL21|And they're doing so good in their businesses.
NEUT22|So just kind of provokes you somewhere inside that.
NEUT23|Things are possible.
NEUT24|What have you learned from this event as a student?

NEUT28|The results show don't matter for these students as long as they can feel the excitement of experiencing a bull run.
NEUT29|That's the kind of student activity that makes learning so much more fun.
