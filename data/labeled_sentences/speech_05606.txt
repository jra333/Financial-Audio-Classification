NEUT0|"""This is a 3 bedroom, 5 bath 3700 square feet."
NEUT1|To me this is the most iconic New York City apartment need or in Alexander the 25 year old.
BULL2|Mr Alexander is part of a growing group of well connected, youthful brokers finding success in the world of high end real estate.
NEUT3|Obviously we're looking directly at Central Park, I think.
NEUT4|Most sellers today want someone who's young, energetic, who's focused their main focus in their life is selling their property, and that's what I've done last year.
NEUT5|34 year old broker, Kyle Blackmon sold Sandy Weill's penthouse on Central Park to 20 something year old Russian areas at Katrina Riab Oliba for 88 million.
NEUT6|The largest residential deal ever to close in Manhattan.
NEUT7|Also, in New York, 29 year old Caroline Bass found fashion personality Tim Gunn a duplex penthouse on Manhattan's Upper West Side in 2010.
NEUT8|Soil Halabi brokered a deal from Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim to buy a 20,000 square foot mansion for $44 million, and this month Josh Flagg, who stars on Bravo TV show $1,000,000 listing, got the listing for Hollywood producer Gavin Polone's $15.9 million house in Beverly Hills.
NEUT9|So this is obviously the master and probably the best view in the whole apartment.
NEUT10|This is the view that you want to go to sleep too.
NEUT11|This is a view you want to wake up to.
NEUT12|This is an $18.8 million view.
BULL13|Selling houses has grown much more attractive as other more traditional options like finance and law have grown more difficult with the recession.
NEUT14|Also, reality TV shows about real estate brokers have glamorized the job drawing more young, ambitious college grads who see it as a lifelong career rather than a side gig.
NEUT15|I don't have wife.
NEUT16|I don't have a girlfriend.
NEUT17|I don't have kids.
NEUT18|My business is my life.
NEUT19|In August, Mr Alexander shattered real estate records when he sold the most expensive home on record in Miami, a $47 million estate in Indian Creek.
NEUT20|Now he's marketing two adjacent Estates in Alpine, NJ with the total price tag of $95 million.
NEUT21|But it's about being at the right place at the right time.
NEUT22|I need to travel to central Pay or if I need to travel to same bar sorta ASP in certain times a year Windows.
NEUT23|Client through their on their last year, Forbes for the first time began a 30 under 30 list for the real estate industry.
BULL24|The National Association of Realtors Young Professionals Network, a group for younger brokers, has seen its memberships well in recent years.
NEUT25|This is my favorite room in the house were in the bathroom in other apartments in the building.
NEUT26|This is the bedroom.
NEUT27|So here they actually just decided to give you space and I like to call it livable for many buyers and sellers.
NEUT28|These young agents are the new power brokers for the Wall Street Journal.
NEUT29|"I'm Lauren sugarplum."""
