BULL0|"""All time high for Nike today and also two new bullish price target increases."
BULL1|Morgan Stanley and Cowan, both raising their targets to $165.
NEUT2|It's our call of the day.
NEUT3|Stephanie Link owns Nike loves Nike hasn't taken any profits in Nike.
NEUT4|Right?
NEUT5|Haven't taken any profits in Nike.
BULL6|I mean it's up 30% year to date.
NEUT7|I could but and it's not cheap, but it's a quality compounder.
BULL8|They have terrific products.
NEUT9|They have a global footprint.
NEUT10|They have a great balance sheet so that they can invest in innovation and technology and the supply chain.
NEUT11|And they're just kicking everybody's **** so I don't really want to sell that.
NEUT12|At this point.
NEUT13|I also think the next leg to the story is DTC and then increasing that and that's going to be margin accretive.
NEUT14|So you'll see operating leverage, so I'm going to stick with it.
BULL15|Stay patient with it and just hope that they can continue to execute like they have been.
NEUT16|Yeah, I mean you echo.
NEUT17|You know what Morgan Stanley saying too about the DTC digital transformation?
NEUT18|That's a big crux of the story may be pulled forward a bit out of necessity because of the pandemic, but a huge growth opportunity, right?
BULL19|It is it's 30% of total revenues, but the margins are 10% higher than a brick and mortar store.
NEUT20|If you will.
NEUT21|So that's why it's so creative if they just got that to 40 percent 50%, you're looking at something like 6-7 dollars of earnings power to this company, so you just don't want to get off that.
NEUT22|Not at these these levels.
NEUT23|I think there's more to go forward PE4P-45.
BULL24|That high for you.
NEUT25|It's very high, very high.
NEUT26|I had to do a double take.
NEUT27|I did a double take 'cause I was like that right 45 1/2 but there it is.
NEUT28|I know forward P-45 it is it is.
NEUT29|But but that's why I say let's look at earnings power.
BEAR30|Let's not look at just next year's earnings, because next year's earnings are much lower than that.
BULL31|If they actually can realize a lot of market share growth in DTC, then you will have 6-7 dollars of earnings power.
NEUT32|And it's not nearly as expensive.
BULL33|By the way, I feel the same way about Costco, and I actually did trim some Costco.
BEAR34|'cause that stock is also trading at near highs.
NEUT35|And it's also very expensive, but I want to pick my battles here and these are not battles that I need to fight.
NEUT36|These are winners, just I have to focus on the other ones that are more project stories if you will.
NEUT37|These are not projects.
NEUT38|The GE's the Wells Fargo's are you talking about those?
BULL39|"Yes, I think I might be OK."""
