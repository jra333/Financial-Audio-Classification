BEAR0|"""Banks are feeling anything but stressed today, right?"
NEUT1|Are they up again?
NEUT2|The things that were pretty big?
BULL3|Yeah, I've seen some big moves in stocks.
BULL4|JP Morgan's a pretty strong Bank of America in less.
NEUT5|I looked.
BULL6|I think we have 4% Morgan Stanley about cities, even cities City I think was up as well today after they took a little bit of beating yesterday.
NEUT7|Now the stress tests came out again and this time there wasn't as much trumpeting an fanfare is last time we heard about them.
NEUT8|Now what did what did they come out and say again?
NEUT9|Well?
BULL10|I think generally the test came out and said, you know, balance sheets are strong.
NEUT11|You don't have to worry as much and for investors the big message also was the Fed was saying we're not going to stand in the way of capital returns.
BULL12|Banks don't have to hoard capital, so that was a very bullish sign from banks.
NEUT13|The second polar sign in this and it's sort of the Fed but not the Fed is something you were just talking about with Mike Santoli.
NEUT14|What's happening in yields?
NEUT15|Because if you think about this in Word piece about this few weeks ago on the one hand of the Fed.
NEUT16|The stress test.
NEUT17|OK, pretty much all clear.
NEUT18|That's great, but on the other hand, you still have the Fed has the 0 interest rate policy, which is a really strong headwind for the big banks.
BULL19|But now if they raise rise exactly is deepening in the curve, that's really good for banks.
NEUT20|So you're sort of getting a combo here right now.
BEAR21|Is there a risk that some of the banks could get caught flat footed in terms of their Treasury Holdings?
NEUT22|I mean, you know, my guess is most of them carry very short term paper, but is there?
NEUT23|Is there a chance that any of the big banks?
NEUT24|Are sitting on longer dated paper is some kind of, I mean never say never, but the feeling you get from looking at the durations that report the size of the Treasury Holdings and more importantly things you look at the net interest margins.
BEAR25|They've been reporting pretty anemic for the biggest banks.
NEUT26|And what that shows you is, these guys are really crowded in and shorter duration paper.
NEUT27|I don't think any of them is it has been sent there past couple months.
NEUT28|You know what?
NEUT29|Let's go.
NEUT30|Buy some 30 year paper.
NEUT31|Let's go to long Bond.
NEUT32|Also keep in mind two years ago.
NEUT33|Even though they were horribly early in, horribly wrong, the regulators said to the banks, you guys better all be prepared for a turn in the rate cycle.
NEUT34|Now of course, that was terrible advice, but if you're you know Jamie Dimon or victim Panda and seven of the regulators say be prepared, you're not going to say, well, forget about them.
NEUT35|I'll just go take a chance.
NEUT36|Let's talk about just bank stocks in general.
BULL37|I mean, the valuations have come up.
BEAR38|I'm only down like I don't know 25% in my Excel F now and not even then maybe 20%.
NEUT39|Which which number is your starting point on that on my Excel is around 20 with like 16.
NEUT40|Now something like that right?
NEUT41|So I don't think people say who you know own City in 2005 or feeling the same way.
NEUT42|No, no, they're not.
NEUT43|They're still there.
NEUT44|Yeah I'm not there, but is there still value in them?
NEUT45|Quick quick answer.
NEUT46|I think there's still value, but it's going to depend what happens with interest rates.
NEUT47|Are we starting to see the cycle?
NEUT48|Is there a turn at hand?
NEUT49|But the big question is going to be as rates rise.
NEUT50|What does that do to mortgage rates?
NEUT51|And then how does the Fed really doesn't choke off the recovery there?
BULL52|Any recovery?
NEUT53|David Riley heard on the street.
BULL54|"Thank you very much."""
