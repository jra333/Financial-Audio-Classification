NEUT0|"""Ketan Aja, he is chief economist, an global head of economics at Morgan Stanley."
NEUT1|You heard both reports in at.
NEUT2|Normally, they disagree.
NEUT3|It's headed, but in in this time, not not so much.
NEUT4|Do you agree as well with with with most of what Steve said?
NEUT5|Yeah, absolutely.
BULL6|I think impact the number on the spending was a little bit higher than what we were expecting.
BEAR7|So with this we will now recruit a law and we are just about a little more than 3 1/2 percent down from pre covid levels in personal consumption and the numbers on personal income has already gone about.
BEAR8|People will level even if you exclude the stimulus transfers which was a big reason why the mountain Monday Klein happened in the person income.
BULL9|So the consumer is in a pretty good shape.
NEUT10|Joe.
NEUT11|The what we're seeing in terms of unemployment, and I guess we have a a number coming soon on the you know, the granddaddy number of them all.
NEUT12|What type of of progress have we seen that it?
BULL13|Did we have some great progress initially because of the bounce and it's moderating?
NEUT14|Or do you expect to see some some pretty good numbers?
BEAR15|It will still be pretty good number, but it of course has to moderate because we have made up a lot of loss rounds, so be expecting over 100,000 plus jobs to be added this month.
BULL16|I the month of September other but look I mean the overall progress I think has been quite phenomenal so far and we are expecting the GDP levels to reach to about 96.5% when we get the third quarter GDP data, which is, you know.
BULL17|Much more surprising number compared to everywhere like just about a few weeks back, so I think the economy is making good progress and going forward.
BULL18|We are going to see moderation just because we made so much of loss tax.
NEUT19|We're talking about stimulus alot an you know just like so many things there is a diversity of opinion on whether it's it's really needed.
NEUT20|Is it a niche need that that we have in the industries that we've talked about a lot?
NEUT21|Or could the entire recovery benefit from more priming of the pump by Congress?
NEUT22|So I would say that route.
BULL23|I mean if we have that stimulus, it would be good because you know you could have a rise in new cases and post potentially some shut down in the winter and so this will kind of help us to have the bridge for that be and where you could have rise in new cases by meaningfully.
NEUT24|But other than that you know if you don't have big rise in new cases and shut down in the winter, we think the economy is on a self sustaining path.
BULL25|We are seeing pretty good levels of.
BEAR26|Rachel so the person income number I mentioned to you is already about people will level.
NEUT27|We're still going from that way by about, you know, roughly the look at your age income is growing at about four plus percent year on year and the saving number, which you know Steve mentioned is in excess of what we were having.
NEUT28|People with levels.
NEUT29|We calculated the excess stock.
NEUT30|So this is not the flow of the stock of saving that will build over the last 4-5 months is over a trillion dollars.
BULL31|And if the consumers were just, you know, spend this excess saving out, we will be about 3% higher on personal consumption in the next four months.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
