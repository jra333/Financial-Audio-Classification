NEUT5|It's a great opportunity and we'd love to have you all right, so let's get into this Facebook chart here.
NEUT6|If you've been following along.
NEUT7|Yesterday I did say that we were going to head for higher prices and we are doing just that.
NEUT8|The reason why we're breaking over this resistance right there?
BEAR9|Big resistance at that 110 level.
NEUT10|That's where we capped out here before.
NEUT11|OK, next resistance is at the 1:15 area right there.
NEUT12|As you can see, it was the close of this candle.
NEUT13|The open of this candle an almost the open of this candle right there.
BEAR14|So that's going to be a tough cookie to crack.
BULL15|If we can close above that level, I believe that Facebook can head to new all time highs.
NEUT16|Looks like it's headed that direction at this point as well.
NEUT17|We're over the major resistance over 110 new all time highs would not be out of the question at all here.
NEUT18|OK, as long as it holds this one ten level.
NEUT19|That I like Facebook for higher prices.
NEUT20|OK 115, that's the resistance you have to lookout for.
NEUT21|Another thing that I want to point out is the channel that we've been trading and we've got this trend line right here and then.
NEUT22|We've got this top of the channel line right here, so that's another reason.
NEUT23|If we get up to 1:15, you know.
NEUT24|Tomorrow, I believe that we're going to take at least a little bit of a pause and less we want to just blast right through it, which I don't think will do.
NEUT25|So if we get up to 1:15, I believe will at least take a pause and maybe bounce back to the bottom of the channel down here at about 1:12 and then continue higher, potentially OK. Those are there just some potential scenarios that I'm throwing your way.
NEUT26|We'll see what happens.
BULL27|Alright guys, thanks for watching and stopping by.
