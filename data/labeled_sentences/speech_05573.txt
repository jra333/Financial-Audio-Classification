NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol PLU G. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute."
NEUT1|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT2|Water in the state.
NEUT3|The obvious, but I want anyways just to build some context there.
BULL4|Very, very impressive.
BULL5|Move to think that the price was actually all the way down there during that opening 30 minutes and now it's been able to battle back up to where it has very impressive movement so that likes it goes without saying.
NEUT6|But now we do under the territory of yeah, great move.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of true power behind this price?
NEUT8|When is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT9|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals run this update here at $32 in this update is just based on a foundational role in charting.
NEUT12|Which dates when levels of resistance are broken and closed.
NEUT13|Above you want to see them act as support IK.
NEUT14|Specially in this situation, why so?
NEUT15|And I'm not saying this will occur, but just from my explanation standpoint.
NEUT16|If the price were to come down to 32 and then break down below there, what would you have at that point you would literally have the price having all of a sudden gone right back inside of this range that it just broke out of an 1 price movements.
NEUT17|Go back inside of ranges that they break out of not exactly sounded genuine.
NEUT18|Power to strength, but to be fair no price just go straight up either so maybe the price comes down here the difference being behaved in that manner.
NEUT19|And then start to curl itself back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there, you have loads down there, and if you envision each one of those estera steps where you go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT21|And that's the name of the game that would truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT22|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $32 as far as levels of resistance.
NEUT23|Now our concern moving forward.
NEUT24|Next level to watch very closely going to be all about that $35 mark.
NEUT25|So keep a close eye on 35, but overall anyway, look at it.
BULL26|Very impressive bounds today.
NEUT27|Not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum moving forward?
NEUT28|Let's see what happens.
NEUT29|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT30|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT31|But it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL33|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR36|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT39|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
