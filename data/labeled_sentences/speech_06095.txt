BULL0|"""Greetings fellow traders."
NEUT1|This is stacks with stacks on stacks.
NEUT2|Today is Monday, July 1st, 2019.
NEUT3|In this video, I'm going to talk about the market index ETF's SPY&DIA.
NEUT4|Here is a one year price chart for the SPY ETF.
NEUT5|I've drawn a line at $295.
BULL6|This is the third time in a year we've approached the 295 level.
BULL7|I expect SPY to breakthrough decidedly this week based on China Tariff news with sharp pullbacks following as the market speculates on the feds next move.
BEAR8|DIA is quite similar, expected to break through 269 and then pull back sharply on fed speculation.
NEUT9|This last weekend I constructed an analysis of the dya ETF.
BULL10|All 30 Holdings pay substantial dividends and earnings are expected to be strong.
NEUT11|The results show a current dya PE ratio of 16.88.
BULL12|Thank you for watching today.
BULL13|I hope you found the information useful.
