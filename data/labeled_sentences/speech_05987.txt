BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I would like to have a look at Alphabet because there might be buying Fitbit and that might be a good chance to get some fractional shares in Alphabet or Google, which you know is doing fairly well for themselves.
NEUT2|Currently.
NEUT3|You know they do a lot of advertising, they have YouTube, they have Google.
NEUT4|They used to have Google plus whatever happened to that current market prices 100 and $1262.62 which gives them a market cap of 800.
NEUT5|$75 billion.
NEUT6|Not quite at the trillion right now, but you know, certainly being very close and staying there.
NEUT7|Dividend is still zero, which you know they could be doing something with all that money that they have.
BULL8|Revenue is $137 billion, which is up 20% and earnings is up $31 billion, which is 150%, but only from the previous year.
BULL9|The year before that, it was not higher than 31, but certainly higher than the 12th that they had.
BULL10|So currently is 27, which is definitely not terrible, and I think that's actually reasonable for a company of this magnitude and safety.
BULL11|So total assets $233 billion, which is up slightly total liabilities $55 billion, which is up significantly and total stockholders equity of $178 billion.
NEUT12|So to sum that all up, certainly growing at a reasonable pace for a company that big 20% is certainly not too bad, and they have the trailing 12 month is 148 billion rather than 100 and 3036 point, something that they have right now.
BULL13|So they continue to grow at a reasonable pace, and so I think that even for a growth investor, that might be a stop to look into.
NEUT14|Dividend investors are obviously out, but value investors, I think should do some research and look into Google, because obviously the company is here to stay.
NEUT15|Obviously YouTube is not going away.
NEUT16|Google is not going away and their whole ad business that is on basically every site on the Internet.
NEUT17|Is also not going away, so I think that the P is reasonable.
NEUT18|Even for a company that doesn't pay dividend because the market cap is enormous and they're not going away.
NEUT19|So if you're looking for a safe company in this day and age, I don't think you can do any better than Google or Alphabet, which is the parent company so.
NEUT20|That's it for me.
NEUT21|For today.
