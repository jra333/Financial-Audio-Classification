NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Blaine with sfbtraders.com and I'm looking at stocks so much for Monday, June the 17th."
NEUT1|1st up our VLT.
NEUT2|We play this on Friday looking for continuation over 450.
NEUT3|That'll be the play there needs to breakthrough that Mark.
NEUT4|If it opens we can then goes green then maybe maybe get an early, but at 4:50 brake will be key.
NEUT5|Mack nice little break out on Friday as well.
NEUT6|Needs follow through that 6 mark.
NEUT7|If we scroll out.
NEUT8|Six months you see it's got a little bit of room here between 6:00 and 6:50, so that could be a potential target there.
NEUT9|Moby looking for breakout?
NEUT10|Over 350 ish.
BULL11|This church known Iran should sell back in early May pop quite nicely.
BULL12|So if we could break through this previous air, this resistance level here through that 350 mark we should be in for another pop.
BULL13|INVN looking for continuation to the 15 mark.
BEAR14|This was the resistance points back in January, February.
NEUT15|Around that 15 area and if it can get through 15 when I get a quick pop.
NEUT16|Tord 16.
BULL17|CHC I this is kind of a deeply on the daily is starting to bounce up just a little bit.
BULL18|The last two sessions, if they can get through three mark then we might be ready to push back towards highs which were 350 near April and May begin near 350 in May.
NEUT19|So watch that three spot there on CHC Eye.
NEUT20|ACA deal just looking for continuation through 20.
BULL21|The stocks been hop over the past couple of months so we had a nice break out through 15 just past week and if it can.
NEUT22|Get through 20.
BULL23|We should continue higher.
BULL24|Dang still turning higher on the daily chart for the past two months needs to breakthrough that high there 776 which.
BULL25|It actually closed up.
NEUT26|It hits 7081, so it's right there on that breakout point.
BULL27|If we'll see where it opens, but I like this thing to continue higher towards 8.
NEUT28|Me ru nice bottom pattern here.
BULL29|If we can actually breakthrough hole above this 450, we should be good for a push towards 5 or 550.
NEUT30|This will be a little bit slower place.
NEUT31|You might have to give it just a few days rather than one day day trade.
NEUT32|So I like this for a swing trade over this 450 mark towards 5 or 550.
BULL33|Friday's high was 462.
NEUT34|So if you're looking for the follow through plates and you just break the 462 mark.
NEUT35|BICM quick update here.
NEUT36|Next break out over 3 on Friday.
BULL37|Closed up near 320.
BULL38|Still looking for a push towards at 3:30 Mark which was the high there and if it can break through that then we should keep going.
NEUT39|So I am.
NEUT40|Still holding half size here.
NEUT41|I did play this on Friday, so we'll see what it does in the morning.
BULL42|But I like this to go higher.
NEUT43|So there's a few church to watch for Monday, June 17th.
NEUT44|Let me know if you guys have any questions.
NEUT45|"I will see you in the trading room."""
