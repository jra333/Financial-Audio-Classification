BULL0|"""Hello Traders and welcome to another video review."
NEUT1|Today is Wednesday, the last day of March 2021.
NEUT2|Let's take a look at the Litecoin to American Dollar Chart.
NEUT3|This is daily timeframe chart and I'm using Japanese candle sticks.
NEUT4|What can we see straight on?
NEUT5|Is that the option is being continued on the light cone.
NEUT6|Since then, last year we've been trading from 4041 levels to the levels of 250.
NEUT7|This is the.
NEUT8|The high of the of the February 2021.
NEUT9|Since then, the market made some kind of pullback, of course, and then of course there was another challenge to break above 258.
NEUT10|Apparently this high was made at 220, another breakdown, and then of course another another.
NEUT11|Another rally the market keeps reading inside of the ascending channel and what's more important, the market respects the channel because we have the hit of the upper boundary.
NEUT12|This is almost a hit of the upper boundary.
NEUT13|So market clearly recognize an respects that.
NEUT14|Is being traded inside of the of the channel.
NEUT15|The uptrend is intact, is still being continued or so the current situation is that we are inside of a triangle pattern, right?
NEUT16|If this is the top around $250 then this is with a of the triangle wave B of the triangle with C wave D. What we are missing is the wave E to the downside and then the options should resume higher towards 250.
NEUT17|That's the first level, then other level is of course 300, and to be exact $304.00.
NEUT18|So this triangle is a continuation pattern or trend continuation pattern and we are waiting for this triangle to be completed and then of course the trend to be assumed.
NEUT19|On the other hand, if we are wrong and this is not what.
NEUT20|What looks like a triangle pattern, then of course we should take a look at this lower triangle line at this lower trendline here around the level of 182.
BEAR21|If the price will break below this level and gets out of the channel for the first time in one year, then of course the next target is 146 and the uptrend is likely completed at 250.
BEAR22|So this would be some kind of a deeper pullback.
NEUT23|To watch 156 and if this level is violated, even towards 105 hundred $7.00.
NEUT24|So please keep an eye on this on this current situation on the light cone because it looks very interesting.
BULL25|Once that the triangle is completed, we are still expecting the way up the options to be continued and the levels of 250 and $300 to be hit.
BULL26|So thank you very much for watching this analysis and I hope I see you guys.
NEUT27|Next time so happy trading.
NEUT28|"Take care and bye bye."""
