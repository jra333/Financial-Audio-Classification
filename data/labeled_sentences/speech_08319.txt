NEUT0|"""Yeah."
NEUT1|Yeah yeah yo.
NEUT2|When Christine what's going on?
NEUT3|It is March 13th, 2021.
NEUT4|Market is officially closed and let's jump right into this one.
NEUT5|We're looking first at the Russell ETF IWM.
NEUT6|So last week I was looking for things that come back to this level that 210 levels and it did.
NEUT7|It came there and as you can see a hammer candle form.
BEAR8|Where it got lower buyers came back in, took it towards its open, and that's typically a bullish signal when you see a hammer candle.
NEUT9|In this case, it was an IT baussan continue to move higher made another hammer candle which is a indecision signal and it moves higher tier.
NEUT10|Next thing you know we closed near record highs.
BULL11|IWM closed at two 3359 record highs two 3415 and I've said it before when things close towards their record high chances are it will make a continuation so I'm on alert to see how next week is going to continue to form.
BEAR12|Based off of this week, we got stimulus checks jumping off now.
BULL13|The American will likely go out to go and spin, and that could be a boost, so that is the ticker IWM, the Russell ETF.
NEUT14|Now let's go to the S&P SMP closed at 3943 thirty four record high 39 Sixty 27 and once again this is pretty close to his record.
NEUT15|High.
NEUT16|In addition to that I was looking last week to see if we would end up having a head and shoulder pattern.
NEUT17|And we didn't, and typically when you have patterns that are supposed to form and they don't, that's usually a bullish signal as well.
BULL18|So we could have some continuation going on into next week and my price target of 4000 is still intact where we can reach that.
NEUT19|Let's see if what happens next week 4000 here we come.
NEUT20|So that is it.
