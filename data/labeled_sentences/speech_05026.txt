BULL0|"""Meantime, I also has tastings about the success of Disney Plus reaching 60 million subscribers as quickly as they did in what the number he had previously expected from the competition."
NEUT1|No, maybe 20 million at best.
BULL2|You know they've most companies have a hard time executing on something as radical as you know, let's go direct to consumer over the Internet, and they've done a remarkable job growing to over 60 million in less than 12 months, you know?
NEUT3|And it took us like 12 or 13 years to get there.
NEUT4|So they're very focused.
NEUT5|Obviously on direct to consumer.
NEUT6|But so are we, and I think you know, we love the challenge and we want to bring the challenge to them.
BULL7|We want to get better than Disney and Family Entertainment, and that's kind of big.
NEUT8|5 or 10 years.
NEUT9|You know, they are very, very good at it.
BULL10|But you know, we're very focused and we continue to learn new things.
NEUT11|What's the lesson in their growth?
NEUT12|Is there so?
NEUT13|I mean, given that you've been surprised by it, is there something you've notice and said?
NEUT14|That's pretty interesting.
NEUT15|We should try that.
BULL16|Well, they've had lots of incredible content and they've been very aggressive about putting that content onto the Disney Plus service.
NEUT17|And then I think it's the power of a great brand like Disney has really carried the day, so if anything, it's emphasized how important it is for us to invest in the Netflix brand and what it represents.
NEUT18|Great series, great films that you can relax with anytime.
NEUT19|Let me ask you a different question about one of your other competitors, which is HBO Max.
BEAR20|A number of critics have said they sort of stubbed their toe on there on the way out of the gate.
NEUT21|You agree with that.
NEUT22|Well, depending on how you read the numbers they got 3 or 4,000,000 people on HBO Max.
NEUT23|So compared to Disney 60, that's a pretty small number, so I think they've got a ways to go.
BULL24|"But you know, they've been a legendary provider of great entertainment for very long time, so I certainly wouldn't count them out."""
