NEUT0|"""Jim Disney has Lion King number one, Spiderman next and Toy Story 4."
BULL1|Not to mention Avengers End game is now the highest grossing films.
NEUT2|Disney is just an annuity stream.
NEUT3|I mean I think that I I have to tell you I hated Lion King and I didn't see it.
NEUT4|I mean the the reviews for Lion King was incredibly blanket like Lion King 2 using NVIDIA chips.
NEUT5|I mean I just feel like that we have to.
NEUT6|Really there is a belief that you do have the 38.
NEUT7|Week this is the new theory.
NEUT8|They own 38 weeks out of 52 and that is about as non secure, cyclical and secular growth as you can get.

NEUT18|Yeah but this this movie.
NEUT19|This movie machine is extraordinary.
NEUT20|It's true I'm looking at percentage of buy ratings.
NEUT21|I think 68% buys.
NEUT22|Everybody likes it coming out of that investor meeting.
