NEUT1|You guys welcome back in this video, we're looking at Roku, stock ticker symbol, Roku, and at the moment on Friday of March 26, this stock is sitting at $300 level an I was watching 320 as a resistance it couldn't get over that an let's have a look at option market and what's going on and where do I think this stock may be headed next before we get started?
NEUT2|If you could drop a like and subscribe to the channel.

NEUT4|It's going to be very quick one, so we'll just zoom out to daily chart one year one day chart.
NEUT5|Here I'm watching at this pattern right now where this stock could be forming this head and shoulders pattern.
NEUT6|Huge head right here.
NEUT7|We have shoulders here and this slip right here is confirming that this is going to be head and shoulders pattern and the bounds point or the support point I'm looking at is going to be 200 day moving average.
NEUT8|At the moment that 200 day moving average is sitting at 260 levels.
BEAR9|So I do think that this stock from here can drop another 40 points and also according to pretty much all people who have been trading options with this Roku I have been observing for the past couple days.
NEUT10|There are a lot of put buyers they came in yesterday and today as well.
NEUT11|If we take a look at the stats so far there are more.
NEUT12|Put buying activity volume and a lot of people are buying I think.
NEUT13|In the money puts or there are some even outside of the money puts right here to 60 to 65 to 90, but most of them are short term, so that's what that's what I'm watching with this stock.
