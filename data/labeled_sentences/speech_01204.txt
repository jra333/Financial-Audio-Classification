NEUT0|"""Well, somebody who knows all of this very, very well is Peter McGuire is Chief Executive Officer at xm.com Peter."
NEUT1|Good morning.
BULL2|Thanks for joining in.
NEUT3|How significant is what happened yesterday?
BEAR4|Because when I look at the prices they seem more bothered about that the slowing global GDP because after being up four and a half percent they cooled off to end just about 2 1/2%.
NEUT5|So how?
NEUT6|How significant are these latest tensions and the US allegation on Iran?
BULL7|Well, that's a very good point and good morning look.
BEAR8|I think majorly yet we are in the global macro data slowdown deserves it.
NEUT9|It's not like it's working through that whole process, but then you know that we have those strikes.
NEUT10|Yesterday the tanker was hit and one of them, Interestingly, was a Japanese tanker and we had our base Prime Minister babysitting to run yesterday.
NEUT11|First time in Japanese leader had been around 40 years, so there's that point.
NEUT12|Could very much it is a checkpoint straight up on Mars is one of the most busiest waterways in the world as far as crude.
NEUT13|Aim is the next point.
BEAR14|As the market goes up, four and a half down 2% for profit taking.
NEUT15|Let's see what happens over the next 24 to 72 hours as far as US and where they place or this with Pompeo.
NEUT16|And naturally I think President Trump will get involved.
NEUT17|We don't take on board the point.
NEUT18|I mean I. I think any of us trying to second guess what US might do over the course of the next 24 to 48 hours with Iran is purely speculation, but we have this chart.
BEAR19|Made on Bloomberg, which shows that how over the last 8 to 12 weeks, more often than not, despite some news flow, the global stress on the growth has weighed in on crude prices, and they've only come down despite Opec's best efforts.
BEAR20|Would you reckon that if this issue does not escalate, further chances of a material crude price upside are very, very minimal?
BULL21|Yes, I agree 100%.
NEUT22|I'll be eating Apple Daddy.
NEUT23|It'll be interesting within their Monday and if on Tuesday next week on my way to Vienna for the OPEC meeting and that that normally that weak leader, you don't get these sort of larger political shocks entering the market.
BEAR24|And if the market does escalate and we can see clear that you have political uncertainty, then I think crude prices or rally higher.
NEUT25|But if we don't see any further actions as far as tankers being hit or any any of missile attacks, then I feel as though you'll see your softness to the crude market.
BEAR26|And it will continue its downward slide, so that's the.
BEAR27|That's the conundrum at the moment.
NEUT28|And so mankind cycle.
BEAR29|I hope you don't see any further shocks, but they're dealing with an uncertain.
NEUT30|An element and it's always remain unknown.
BULL31|Yeah, that I agree.
NEUT32|So Peter, just very quickly I think OPEC what it will do seems to be a foregone conclusion with the recent spates of news coming out.
NEUT33|What's your?
NEUT34|What's your prediction for what crude prices do?
NEUT35|If there is nothing unusual that happens in OPEC as well?
NEUT36|I think it's office.
BEAR37|I think there's that will continue to the downside.
NEUT38|I wouldn't be surprised to track a 48 handle for W. TI-49 and I think that's great for probably around about 5758 and that'll take possibly a couple of weeks to work through an let's just see where you know pickers will have its own views on this and their conscious as far as US and China trade talks 220 coming up and all of those major moving parts.
NEUT39|So again, it creates a level of uncertainty and I feel as though there's more softness and.
NEUT40|It's certainly a short ride and let's just say you know miss all attacks and something ramp up there.
BULL41|Appreciate you joining in Peter and giving us those insights.
BULL42|Thanks much for taking the time out.
BULL43|"Thank you very much."""
