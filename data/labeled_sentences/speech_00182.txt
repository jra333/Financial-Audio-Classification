BULL0|"""Well, when I look at this election and I'm, I'm assuming that we're going to have a Biden victory."
NEUT1|The blue waves, and maybe that's wrong, but I'm just looking at the odds.
BEAR2|I'm looking at the polls and clearly clearly that could be wrong, but I think the markets believe that's going to be really good for stocks Ann.
NEUT3|I think the narrative around what will happen if we have that blue way will be correct in the sense that next year you're going to get a massive fiscal stimulus.
BULL4|You're going to get a big boost to the economy.
BULL5|There's no doubt that Main Street under this program is going to benefit, and you probably will have higher nominal profits.
BEAR6|But the other side of that is what also happens to financial assets, and I think under a blue wave in the bottom tax plan, I think financial assets over the long run suffer a great deal.
NEUT7|There's a if you kind of go back and look in history.
NEUT8|There's a inverse relationship and it's loose, but it's clearly there.
NEUT9|There's an inverse relationship between stock multiples and capital gains tax.
NEUT10|So were The Who will be the highest capital gains tax at 43 percent since 1922?
NEUT11|And if again, if we just do just a very simple regression, an again there is great variability within that fit.
NEUT12|But you can kind of say that.
NEUT13|For every 10 point increase in the capital gains taxes, probably some tracks somewhere between two and five multiples from the S&P.
NEUT14|So with the S&P at 25 multiple right now.
NEUT15|Assuming that the tax hike stayed in place over many years, maybe eight years, then you probably think overtime you get multiple compression.
BEAR16|You're clearly going to get margin compression, because in addition to capital gains tax hike.
NEUT17|We're going to get a corporate tax hike, so that probably takes off by itself 13 or $14.00 from from earnings next year, so I think it's I think the Biden tax plan is actually going to do exactly what it's designed to do, which is to help Main Street help the average American.
BULL18|And it's going to come at the expense of the 1%.
NEUT19|Primarily, his wealth is encapsulated in.
NEUT20|The stock market and financial assets Ann is going to come at their expense, and you're probably going to get a multiple compression and you'll probably get some kind of mean reversion back to more normal long term stock average.
NEUT21|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT22|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
