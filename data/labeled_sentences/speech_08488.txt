NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|I should also note from disclosure standpoint, I do own Apple from the long side.
NEUT4|Enter my retirement accounts, so just keep that in mind as I progressed through the analysis.
NEUT5|Got this one totally wrong.
NEUT6|I did a video on it Thursday and talked about the rising wedge and how that's a bearish pattern.
BEAR7|Now I suppose in my defense I did say hey, just because something is bearish and there's a bearish pattern doesn't mean that for sure the price is going down because sometimes you just have absolute monsters like this with Apple and it just is marching up towards 500.
NEUT8|I'm not complaining at all.
NEUT9|As I mentioned in Thursday's video given I own this from the long side in my retirement accounts.
NEUT10|I would love to be wrong and I was wrong, but truly just a monster movement.
NEUT11|That's really all you can put it.
NEUT12|The vast majority of the time when you have the patterns that Apple formed on Thursday and I talked about that rising wedge, you know I'm not going to say that the stock crashes, but the vast, vast majority of the time the next day, the price does not behave like this.
NEUT13|So I mean, truly, a freak in nature, and this is.
NEUT14|What it's all about, so let's get some things updated here.
NEUT15|Well, the newest levels of support is going to be down here at the 487 mark, and that's what I would call the ideal of weekly one.
BULL16|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be if the price can stay up above the 488 mark.
NEUT17|Now taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT18|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT21|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher an.
NEUT22|That is very helpful because when it comes to engaging in a very methodical and very almost lazy way, the health of the general sharp just watch that purple line and as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the bulls are in full control, the bulls are in full health hiring us.
NEUT23|Visualize that.
NEUT24|That is what is being represented as far as areas of resistance are concerned, they just don't matter at this point.
NEUT25|What do I mean by that?
NEUT26|What matters the most is what the price is already been doing, and that's this right here.
NEUT27|Just chipping away and building higher bases, or envision this terror steps.
NEUT28|So as long as there are substantive, deconstructing the upward struction.
NEUT29|Then, given enough time, everything else will continue to take care of itself, including breaking always over sistance.
BEAR30|But overall Apple Total beast.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you.
NEUT41|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again totally live.
