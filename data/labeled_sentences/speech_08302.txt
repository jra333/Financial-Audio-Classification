NEUT0|"""Lambert will see with me is chase will see more from Wilson Management wants today's Smart investing daily briefing well."
NEUT1|Today's exciting day because Shanghai Disney has opened and we thought we'd go over it by the numbers for you kind of show you things that nobody else will.
NEUT2|Show it 'cause we show you the numbers on Shanghai.
NEUT3|Disney now here's some important things.
NEUT4|It took him 7 years to build that and the cost of almost 6 billion dollars.
NEUT5|I'm thinking.
NEUT6|That's a lot of money So what is maybe the break.
NEUT7|Even so, I did the math here?
NEUT8|Their break even is about 103 million visitors.
NEUT9|If they pay about an average of $58 within the ranges go from 45 like 79 of the ticket prices.
NEUT10|Now I will point out this does not include when you get into this theme park and by the novel Tees and the food and so forth, but nor does it include the expenses and they have about 10,000 employees.
NEUT11|So the numbers here that got a question to make money on this should definitely talk about 103 million visitors right here.
NEUT12|Their annual visitors is estimated to be about 15 million, so.
NEUT13|That's a few years to reach that 130,000,000 and also just kind of for comparison sake.
NEUT14|So we took a look at Hong Kong Disney.
BEAR15|They lost 19 million last year.
BEAR16|Wow, so if the company is not profitable, it's going to take them a long time to pay off that $6 billion.
NEUT17|I kind of speaking about Disney as a whole though.
NEUT18|The company, the stock, the current forward P 14.7 I remember back.
NEUT19|Oh I forget when it was, but it was trading at $122.
BULL20|There was a 52 week high.
NEUT21|It's now at $98 per share.
NEUT22|Think of it, you got 1819.
NEUT23|That's why I tell you don't.
NEUT24|Overpay for companies.
NEUT25|Be patient and I would love to own Disney again if it drops a little bit more.
BEAR26|We could be all over it.
NEUT27|Remember when everyone said Star Wars is going to save this company?
NEUT28|They're going through the roof.
NEUT29|They did not.
NEUT30|So alright, let's talk about are coming for the day and it's American Airlines.
NEUT31|You thought they were going to fly over to Shanghai and see it.
NEUT32|So I thought that was an airline here for you so you can see that American was way up here and then it went down and so forth.
BULL33|The 52 week high 47.
BEAR34|The low 29 right now pretty much at a low level.
NEUT35|These numbers and see if American Airlines is a good buy for you.
BEAR36|We do see those sales uh-oh down 4.4% but they only share climbed 143%.
NEUT37|How they doing that?
NEUT38|Got that question.
BEAR39|Balance sheet data current racial .7 not very strong.
NEUT40|And this debt equity 461%.
BEAR41|I don't like seeing that.
NEUT42|It seems like they leverage themselves a lot to buy these planes and stuff.
NEUT43|I know other airlines aren't doing that exactly and you're asking about the earnings versus sales here.
NEUT44|American Airlines is one of the only companies that does not hedge oil, which is very very concerning given the low low levels oil they wish they were huge benefactors from that.
NEUT45|However on the other side it is a huge concern, but we did.
NEUT46|It took a look going forward to December 2017.
NEUT47|Estimated earnings per share here.
NEUT48|$5.51 gives a target sell price of $90.92.
BULL49|Wow, that sounds very attractive, but again, very scary.
BEAR50|With this debt and also talking about that oil two months ago, the estimate for December 2017 it was $6.04 and then three months ago, $6.49 what happened was we saw the price of oil to creep up their estimated earnings start to creep down 'cause it's going to squeeze margins so well.
NEUT51|That's some great information matters.
BULL52|So again, we hope you enjoy this information helps you and so forth.
BEAR53|But let me ask you, maybe you're just not happy with the current return on your portfolio on your money.
NEUT54|Maybe you're kind of visor is not doing this research, not getting this good information for you.
