NEUT0|"""November 21st is in the books here on Wall Street."
NEUT1|Here's the New York minute.
NEUT2|We have a Grand Slam.
BULL3|The S&P 500 is an all time high and so the NASDAQ composite, the Dow Industrials and the Russell 2000 first time, all those four well known indices have made a high on the same day since 1999.
BULL4|Now energy stocks have led the way today.
NEUT5|That's because people are excited about what President Trump might do for the energy sector.
NEUT6|More broadly, if we take a look at dividend aristocrats, high yield playing stocks, you can see that the rest of the market is really caught up with them.
NEUT7|Now, great excitement for those companies that weren't paying out big dividends.
NEUT8|Meanwhile, if you take a look at how value stocks are doing that look cheap compared to their fundamentals.
BULL9|They've also had a huge rebound.
BEAR10|Meanwhile looking longer term stocks are now actually very slightly beating bonds over the last 10 years, which is just a big reevaluation.
BULL11|All the more impressive because if you believe the Fed funds futures market we are now have a 100% chance of a rate rise next month for stocks to be performing this well with the rate rise coming.
NEUT12|Suggest that people really do believe there's growth in store.
NEUT13|"And that's the New York minute."""
