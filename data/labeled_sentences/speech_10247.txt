BEAR0|"""There are several articles today which say that the president is concerned that J&J is not ready for 20 million."
NEUT1|They promised 20 million.
NEUT2|David, I've talked to J&J, but it's all on scared.
NEUT3|They've got the 20 million.
NEUT4|But this leads me to another point.
NEUT5|OK, there is so much I don't want to call this information.
BEAR6|'cause that's rude.
BEAR7|There's so much indecision and lack of direction coming from the administration right now.
NEUT8|Like can you cruise?
NEUT9|Can you not cruise if you're vaccinated?
NEUT10|What does it mean?
NEUT11|Just the set?
NEUT12|Of rules in terms of where we are and what we can do once you've been vaccinated like so.
NEUT13|Who's at fault?
NEUT14|There was at the CDC.
NEUT15|God, I hate to say this, but but doctor Roschelle Widlansky FDA not giving any clarification.
NEUT16|Well, CDC National Institute of Health I don't want to blame Doctor Ballensky, but everybody is a little confused.
NEUT17|Like if you're in the cruise ship business, you're trying to figure out what the right thing did.
NEUT18|What do they want right?
NEUT19|Or do they just not one cruises right?
BEAR20|And you know, a lot of people are in these stocks and you see that they've been going down a flea.
BEAR21|Because people are beginning to concern that there isn't anything they can do that would allow cruising to come well.
NEUT22|That's absurd, and that's going to change.
NEUT23|Would have to, you know, some point we're going to get to 70% of the population or something like that.
NEUT24|Being vaccinated, but it is not matter.
NEUT25|Some of the cruise lines have proposed to the government listen, we will have.
NEUT26|We have happy to have the crew vaccinate and we're happy to have all the right, but it's this group under under 16.
NEUT27|A lot of people sail with their families.
NEUT28|Yeah, and they're not being vaccinated now.
NEUT29|Moderna's vaccine that there isn't trial.
NEUT30|It is like there's it is so many directions there are once you've been vaccinated.
NEUT31|No shoes, no ServiceNow, vax.
NEUT32|I mean, Jim, you're bringing up points that a lot of people are trying to understand and deal with this.
NEUT33|They imagine this.
NEUT34|OK, it's fine with me.
NEUT35|Well, this is 3 or do I have to be here?
NEUT36|No, it's fine with no mass, I mean, but you're fully vaccinated.
NEUT37|I'm halfway there.
NEUT38|Well, call me when you're done.
NEUT39|Work completely done.
NEUT40|I don't care where we are, but where do we?
NEUT41|What are we supposed to do?
NEUT42|We don't have A and doctor Fouchy as much as I love him.
NEUT43|Not necessarily In Sync with other parts of the government.
NEUT44|Yeah, so I am concerned that there is any chance of Johnson stock doesn't really seem to be.
NEUT45|Could you just put out a story which saying that they don't have it?
NEUT46|If you called J&J like I did you find out that they do have it?
NEUT47|I threw in a call.
NEUT48|I did what I call reporting.
NEUT49|That's always a good thing to do.
NEUT50|Yeah, the phone up right.
NEUT51|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT52|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
