NEUT0|"""Hey, how's it going?"
BEAR1|Everybody welcome back to the channel so I'm going to go over the portfolio for today and it's just back to back red bays red all over blood on the streets down on basically over 6% throughout the whole day.
BEAR2|I'm after hours down more than $2000 and just look at the percentages.
NEUT3|My oh I also got.
BULL4|I also actually got a sold adoption for Neo.
NEUT5|Think it was a good time an.
BEAR6|For me it's a month out and triggers of Neil goes below $45.00.
NEUT7|So and in the break even is 4287.
BULL8|So so pretty good.
BULL9|I think it's a pretty good value for me and I get $200 in premium believe.
NEUT10|$213 in premium and I would get Neo at $45.00.
NEUT11|A share, which is I think it's all an amazing deal concerning, then your head all the way to 67 and at 45 bucks I believe will 100 bucks will be more than two X if it does trigger an I don't think Neil stay under $45.00 into by next month.
BULL12|I believe it will come back once earnings come, so I think it's a nice quality risk I took.
NEUT13|I also bought one share of Jumia.
BEAR14|Any was down 8%, so I believe Julie's gonna be there for the long run.
BEAR15|But look look at the portfolio kneel down 5% after down 6% shut down 2% Julia down 8% Corsair Gaming down 5% and P actually is doing really good really good.
BULL16|It's just breaking all time highs.
NEUT17|I still don't have 100 shares in this one.
BULL18|I would just want to like for it to go down a little bit to slow down 1.35% drop box was doing doing good.
BEAR19|It announced earnings I need to check that out but after hours it is down 4.8%.
BEAR20|And I hope we are down 2%.
BULL21|So I mean, hopefully you guys are doing better than me.
NEUT22|I mean all I see today was a buying opportunity.
NEUT23|And I just took a little bit.
NEUT24|I didn't want to buy that much 'cause I'm on margin right now.
NEUT25|And if Neil doesn't hit that 45 bucks, I get that 200 bucks to pay off a little bit of the margin.
NEUT26|So before I was at $13,000 below 13,000, which is good, and I do my taxes.
NEUT27|I'm going.
NEUT28|I'm waiting for my tax return.
BULL29|So whatever I get from Matts, hopefully I'll be able to put some of it into it here to have more buying power to get closer to our goal.
NEUT30|We want to get to 50K as fast as possible, hopefully before then this year ends and then wanted to 100 and 200 K. So hopefully you guys bought some stuff today.
BEAR31|Specially to me it was a beautiful by April 8 down 8%.
NEUT32|This baby was all the way up to basically 70 bucks at one point and it was down to $50,053 now so we might see there more, read tomorrow's or pay attention to the markets.
NEUT33|Might be some good time to buy.
NEUT34|Don't buy on margin alot.
NEUT35|Remember I'm not a financial advisor so.
NEUT36|Do your own due diligence and let's get this money.
NEUT37|"Let's take advantage of these days."""
