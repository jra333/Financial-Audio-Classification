NEUT0|"""Today we're going to talk about euro dollar, but briefly want to talk about the dollar index now."
BULL1|We had a decent move to the downside from the December highs in the May lows.
NEUT2|We've since corrected hire a few important factors that keep this medium term bias bearish.
BEAR3|The first we rejected gains close to the previous swing low.
BEAR4|This was also a 61.8% for bernacki pullback level of this downward move Furthermore.
NEUT5|All the moves or waves higher can be counted in three waves, and this is common in corrective formations, so our medium term box remains bearish, but we do need to see a solid break of this channel formation.
NEUT6|If we break down to a shorter timeframe.
BULL7|This was the last move to the upside, so we've got a bullish five wave pattern.
BEAR8|Elliott Wave and we've since corrected lower yesterday now.
BULL9|On the run up to Jackson Hole, we're probably going to consolidate.
BEAR10|It's probably going to be mixed and volatile.
NEUT11|Intraday price action, and we're probably gonna stay within this range is 9490 range 9415 now.
NEUT12|Our preferred trade is to buy into dips.
NEUT13|Running into that event so reflecting that onto euro dollar.
NEUT14|Kate, here is the daily chart.
BEAR15|We broke a channel formation to the upside, but we stalled at Fibonacci confluence Area and this was the 61.8% pullback of this downward move and also 161.8% extension of this move here.
BULL16|Now we're looking for the medium term buyers to remain bullish and to actually target levels close to this previous swing high, however.
BEAR17|This looks to be a fourth wave correction.
NEUT18|The support at 112 sixty, which is the reverse trend line.
NEUT19|If we break down to a shorter time frame.
BEAR20|Just a note, the last move lower.
NEUT21|This can be seen in five ways, similar or reverse to that turd, that dollar bias and then we've moved higher yesterday.
NEUT22|So this looks to be a be in a larger AV CD formation.
NEUT23|And in fact if we look too.
NEUT24|30 minute sharp.
NEUT25|We can see here that.
NEUT26|Rejecting rallies.
NEUT27|And a move lower.
NEUT28|So this being a B this BBC and this being CD wouldn't take us down very close to that reverse trend line support.
BULL29|So our call over the next couple of days is to sell into euro dollar strength.
NEUT30|Around about one, thirteen, 4550 this one target, and that's one 1260 which is ABCD formation and the reverse trendline support the stop on this trade.
NEUT31|Given it quite a good risk.
BULL32|"Reward is above the previous swing high, and that's at one 1370."""
