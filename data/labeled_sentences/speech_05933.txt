NEUT0|"""It's going to be a video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, very nice movement on this one today, not only from the price action standpoint, but look down here at the volume and wild volume wasn't gigantic.
BULL5|It was definitely still very respectable.
NEUT6|So point here being a lot of eyeballs.
NEUT7|Gonna be watching this one headed into Wednesday.
NEUT8|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT9|So the first level of support is what I would call it.
NEUT10|Ideal level was likely not make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that will be the price.
NEUT11|Can say up there above 3140.
NEUT12|Now.
NEUT13|Don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3140.
NEUT14|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but if the price could manage step above that area.
BULL15|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT16|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT17|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT18|The 50.
NEUT19|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT20|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there, being defined as the move, just watch a purple line.
NEUT21|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT22|Her best visualize that that is what is being represented.
BULL23|Again yes and above 3140 would be great.
NEUT24|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the pool is 100% owned.
BULL25|The chart as far as areas of resistance.
NEUT26|Pretty straightforward right now.
NEUT27|You can see that basically three times today the price got up there to generally speaking the 3180 Mark.
NEUT28|So once twice third time right there and just can never quite push through it.
BEAR29|So 3180 where the sellers are currently hanging out at, and that's going to be the main area of resistance moving forward.
NEUT30|But All in all, any angle you look at it, great volume today, great price movement, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward.
NEUT31|Let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL35|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT40|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
