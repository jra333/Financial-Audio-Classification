NEUT0|"""What's up everyone?"
NEUT1|Brad here from the money Dad channel.
NEUT2|In this video I want to take a look at SiriusXM ticker, Siri, 'cause there is an inverse head and shoulders pattern playing out.
NEUT3|I want to update you on what's going on there so I've got SiriusXM pulled up in Tradingview and we're going to chart it out real quick so that we can.
NEUT4|We can see where we're at in the pattern and take a look at the price target that this is projecting to the upside and inverse head and shoulders is.
BEAR5|A a a bullish pattern IT projects upside on the stock.
NEUT6|So we're going to have a bullish price projection in this video, and we'll see where that is.
NEUT7|So we're going to start by drawing up a neckline, right?
NEUT8|So we've looks like we've got a neckline right here, and I'll show you what that I'll tell you what that means here right now.
NEUT9|Basically, what an inverted head and shoulders is is.
NEUT10|It's a picture of basically a person, right?
NEUT11|You got two shoulders and ahead, but it's.
NEUT12|Upside down it's inverse, right?
NEUT13|So that didn't happen there.
NEUT14|We connect that there you go so you got your shoulder and get your head and you got your shoulder right.
BEAR15|It's upside down.
NEUT16|Basically, think about a person with two shoulders and ahead but upside down so you got shoulder head shoulder right so this is a stock chart pattern that projects upside potential on a stock chart.
NEUT17|So there is our two shoulders an hour head on SiriusXM Stock Chart and then typically what happens after that is you break above this neckline.
NEUT18|Which is exactly what SiriusXM did and you retrace back to the neck line, which is what it looks like is happening right now.
NEUT19|You bounce off of it and you go to the upside.
NEUT20|And we can project a price target on this kind of chart pattern based on the size of the head.
NEUT21|From the neckline.
NEUT22|So I'm going to show you what I mean by that.
NEUT23|Right now we're going to measure from the bottom of the head up to the neckline.
NEUT24|Right there we get $1.15.
BULL25|That's our upside potential.
BULL26|KE dollar 1523%.
NEUT27|So when we retrace when the price action retraces back to the neck line right here.
NEUT28|If this pans out, ideally it's going to touch this neckline and then the price target from there is $1.15 to the upside from there, so we measure.
NEUT29|Dollar 15 from Woops, we measure $1.15 from our neckline.
NEUT30|Right, and we get $7.16 as our upside target.
NEUT31|So this is suggesting that SiriusXM is probably going to dip a little bit more to touch that neckline.
NEUT32|It's possible that it doesn't dip anymore and we just go up from here.
NEUT33|But I would not be surprised that I'm almost expecting it to dip a little bit more touch that neckline right there and then head up to our price target.
NEUT34|OK guys, so that's what I'm looking at for SiriusXM.
NEUT35|I just wanted to give you guys an update 'cause I made a video on this couple of weeks ago so we had a lot more candle sticks playing out.
NEUT36|It does look like we are doing exactly what I thought we were going to retrace to this neckline and then we'll see here in a couple of candle sticks if we're going to touch it and head to the upside or not right?
NEUT37|That's what I got for SiriusXM.
