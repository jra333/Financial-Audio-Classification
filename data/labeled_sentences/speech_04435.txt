BEAR0|"""Watching the Dow yesterday, it was Apple that was one of the real drags on the Dow."
NEUT1|You said people should pay a little more attention to it.
NEUT2|Maybe be a little more patient and understand what was happening with the story this morning.
BULL3|Apple is up more than it gave back yesterday again, about 1 1/2% right now.
NEUT4|Well, look, there's a piece that came out UBS.
NEUT5|It's the evidence lab, which we often find does some pretty quality work and the theme of it is basically that look, don't worry bout it.
NEUT6|There's no super cycle, but it's pretty good.
NEUT7|iPhone ecosystem.
NEUT8|$14.00 auto optionality.
NEUT9|And then just kind of curious.
NEUT10|Some of the parts you know.
NEUT11|I don't know ones breaking up anytime soon, but it is kind of like longer term.
BULL12|The situation is great.
NEUT13|Shorter term.
NEUT14|I don't see anything in this that should jump the stock like this, but I think people are eager to own some big cap once.
NEUT15|I mean it's just, they just kind of want to own these and apples right there for the picking.
NEUT16|It is the other thing we've been talking about.
BULL17|This morning is just how strong the transports have been.
NEUT18|We've talked with Phil about the airlines, but really, if you look at some of those other transports, I've seen some of the rails hitting not just 52 week highs but all time.
NEUT19|Highs recently transports kind of taking off on every level.
NEUT20|You're so right?
NEUT21|I mean, we're seeing the transports to amazingly and I just look no further than Union Pacific, which basically told you business is not good right now.
NEUT22|They could have just a not great quarter.
BEAR23|Stock goes down 5 and then goes up.
NEUT24|15 people want this group.
NEUT25|There are just the industrials they want.
NEUT26|They want the transports.
NEUT27|And that's why I want to see what happens with Apple because they tend not to want the big cap tech knees.
NEUT28|Maybe the individuals too, but the institutions don't.
NEUT29|Yeah, I mean this is just this amazing story where the Dow this is the last trading day not only of the month but the quarter and watching what's happened with the Dow Jones industrial average over the last month.
BULL30|Over the last quarter has been pretty phenomenal.
NEUT31|It's really the old industrial is taking off how long you think a trade like that last last.
BEAR32|This numbers are still going up.
BULL33|We saw the numbers go up today for eating.
NEUT34|We saw someone recommend Carrier at the same time NASDAQ this month of March.
BEAR35|Right now on track to be as bad as October.
NEUT36|People don't really care whether things are going to get better.
NEUT37|For some of these companies that are software and some of them that are our hardware, Taco or health care, what they want are companies that are just simply seeing St really strong growth because of the reopening trade and because of some of the numbers that we see coming from this country in GDP.
NEUT38|That's what people want.
NEUT39|That's what the institutions one, and there's this rearguard action to buy a lot of these incredibly high price to sales companies.
NEUT40|And they're not flying, they they go Romeo power on you.
BEAR41|Romeo, where art by a large lower.
NEUT42|Wherefore art thou Romeo I love the industrial straight, it just feels good right to get into this idea of things that you can see, that you understand that kind of run with it.
NEUT43|It's interesting to see.
NEUT44|I think we're going to look at these companies.
NEUT45|Been buying back stock and there's no insider selling.
NEUT46|They've been sitting there, they're just terrific.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
