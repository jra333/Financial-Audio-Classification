NEUT0|"""Forbes and Manhattan Call is a high quality thermal and metallurgical coal producer headquartered in Toronto with operations in South Africa."
NEUT1|It has a market cap of 314 million Rand.
NEUT2|It made a loss in its most recent results and currently pays no difference.
NEUT3|No difference, no dividends.
NEUT4|Well, this is Forbes Cole again, let's look at this story as we said listed Toronto.
NEUT5|Does that change the game here?
NEUT6|I don't think it's listing changes that came obviously.
BEAR7|It's pretty illiquid here in South Africa.
NEUT8|I mean, you'll be able to see that and.
NEUT9|When you see this strange graphs, you know that there's a lot of liquidity efforts, yeah, but there's a bit of liquidating in Canada.
NEUT10|So I mean, if you want to buy, it may be biting Canada.
BULL11|Certainly it's again another junior Coleman is trying to ramp up production.
NEUT12|It's got two smaller Commons Magdalena Annavi more.
NEUT13|Both have quite a long life of mind, which is good, and no one does more anthracite.
NEUT14|Another one is more clinical thermal call, but I'm sure you've got a story behind this one.
NEUT15|Yeah, well, you know what happens with these?
NEUT16|Is that it started out his life as a Canadian listed entity?
NEUT17|Although the CEO's name is Steven, thrown OK, not my brother or uncle, but I need to know if I could pull that all the same.
NEUT18|So now I mean, obviously there's a significant connection to Aviemore.
BEAR19|Mine is one of those that if you're driving down towards Utrecht and Dundee, there in the northern part of case it in and you come across an area that looks as though it's got black dust on it from the last 50 years of activities, you'll see the every more sign, so it's kind of a reverse listing, but it's liquidity here isn't good.
NEUT20|And I guess it just depends on how it's going to go.
NEUT21|If you look at their operations, they say they made like revenue of about $80 million for the year.
NEUT22|'cause obviously they reported in Canada and they made profits.
NEUT23|But the profit seems to be dependent on whether they're doing more capital spending or not, but the same old game plan.
NEUT24|I wouldn't buy them here.
NEUT25|2 liquid's not much going on.
NEUT26|Not that much liquidity.
NEUT27|Not much visibility.
NEUT28|I think it's gloss over this one pretty quickly, then hot or not on Forbes called Jonathan.
NEUT29|Well, I mean one other thing I want to say is the Canadian share price is 80 Canadian cents.
NEUT30|Now if you take that back into random, it's about 6:50 now I think.
NEUT31|It's sitting at around about 10 Randon SA.
NEUT32|Just 'cause it hasn't traded, so I mean, certainly don't bite it's Africa tender.
NEUT33|And I mean it maybe put an offer in six and if you do want it, but it's certainly not from our side.
NEUT34|"Final point that make makes sense at all to look at the comparisons here there so not hot, not hot to unfold is called."""
