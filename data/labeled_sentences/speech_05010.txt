NEUT0|"""Go to alexshermanfromcnbc.com, who's got a little bit more analysis as well on what's crossing the table, what might be coming a bit later from Netflix?"
BULL1|Yeah, thanks.
NEUT2|Well I think the important thing to look at is Netflix is saying that it is going to be cash flow positive for every year after 2021 and now expects to be break, even cashflow four 2021.
BEAR3|It's also saying it will not need outside financing moving forward, so the bear case against Netflix for years now has been that the overwhelming cost of original content will simply be too expensive.
NEUT4|This seems to fly in the face of that.
NEUT5|Netflix basically says, look.
BULL6|We're going to be able to generate enough cash from our operations to sell fund, so Netflix has borrowed $15 billion in the last 10 years since 2011.
NEUT7|It now says it will no longer need to borrow anymore money.
BULL8|Obviously, Netflix was helped a lot by the pandemic this past year.
BULL9|Big jump in subscribers, but this very much validates the long term bull thesis for Netflix investors.
BULL10|Alex thanks very much for that.
NEUT11|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT12|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
