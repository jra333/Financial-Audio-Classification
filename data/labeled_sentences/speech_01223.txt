BULL0|"""All right, David."
NEUT1|Let's start with the concept of cadence.
NEUT2|Because we have a lot of younger viewers now, watching him trying to explain it's entirely possible and you see a net number, say for KFC, which was a blowout that it may have.
NEUT3|Maybe that the beginning of the quarter was not so good, but you finished strong at the end, correct?
NEUT4|You've got that exactly right, Jim.
BULL5|The momentum that we had this quarter was really impressive.
BULL6|We started from obviously some depths coming out of the initial impact of the virus, but our teams around the world pivoted very quickly, embraced consumers new needs, and really strengthen the business.
NEUT7|As the quarter went on, you think about it, you know what what happened in April, which is included in the quarter that feels like 2018 to me.
BULL8|That's so far in the rearview mirror, what matters right now is the momentum in the business, and where we're headed at really confident, we're headed to a good place.
BEAR9|Right now, Pizza Hut in United States, which I've been quite worried about because it's been a laggard.
NEUT10|You had a 1% same store sales.
NEUT11|Now I want people to understand how many actual physical restaurants could you go into in Pizza Hut and sit down and eat with that number.
BULL12|Yeah, actually pizza in Usik was up five, but the reality is if you pull apart the Pizza Hut number back to your point about really understanding the details, the Pizza Hut delivery and carryout business was up 21% in the United States.
NEUT13|When you exclude clothes stores closed express unit, so that's really the relevant number.
BULL14|Obviously, you know that's a great number of stacks up well against the competition, and that's all done as you.
NEUT15|As you point out, with dining rooms closed all around the United States.
NEUT16|Essentially don't have any of the very.
BEAR17|We have very few pizza dining rooms open today.
NEUT18|Yeah, it's just the model is better than I thought for this, But the one that I'm confused about, why did you not break out Taco Bell?
NEUT19|United States?
NEUT20|Taco Bell US always very, very closely mirrors the global number, since the preponderance of our stores are in the US, but that number was 7%.
BEAR21|The down 7%.
BEAR22|Importantly, if you look at what Taco Bell was laughing, they left a huge quarter.
NEUT23|Only slightly positive on the two year basis and there are great example of what I was talking about.
BEAR24|What you mentioned early on the cadence of the quarter they got hit harder than any of our businesses in the US just because they had a higher dine-in percentage and the breakfast and late night business as has been well documented.
NEUT25|You know those parts of the business have gone away as people are supposed mostly staying home so they had a lot to overcome.
BULL26|They got hit the hardest at the beginning of the pandemic and they've actually made the most progress during the quarter.
BULL27|And as we pointed out on the call, the business is stabilized in June and July.
BULL28|Actually, all three of our US brands are positive right now.
NEUT29|Yeah, I was reading this morning.
NEUT30|The Taco cut 18 seconds from drive through time.
NEUT31|I mean where are we in making drive-thrus operationally perfect?
NEUT32|Yeah, the Taco Bell team marking and Mike Grams or Chief Operating Officer in the entire team.
BULL33|But the franchise partners have done an amazing job embracing the need for speed in this environment.
NEUT34|They are now below 4 minutes now on total time for customers and with the ability to order Taco Bell on the digital app with just one click and then pull into the drive through and pick up your store.
NEUT35|Your food.
BULL36|"There's no better way to get an amazing deal and an incredibly easy way."""
