NEUT0|"""Let's talk a bit about what's going on in crypto these days."
NEUT1|Jerrod Blicker joins us.
NEUT2|Now we're looking at market share that maybe has gotten a little bit short shrift as we've paid attention to NFTS for sale.
BULL3|Come upon later in the show stocks at record highs, but in the background, crypto continues to grind to a larger collective.
NEUT4|A record collective market cap or the entire space.
NEUT5|That's right, miles $2 trillion.
NEUT6|That's a pretty big number.
NEUT7|Only two months ago it was $1 trillion and now Bitcoin makes up over half of that.
NEUT8|So I think it was a few weeks ago we celebrated the big Bitcoin $1 trillion mark.
NEUT9|So now the entire crypto market is bigger than Alphabet.
NEUT10|Facebook, notably not Apple just yet, but here we go.
BULL11|So Bitcoins up just slightly today.
NEUT12|Story is really ether.
NEUT13|We don't talk probably enough about ether either.
NEUT14|That is at a record high, and that's closing in on 2200.
NEUT15|I guess get out your hats for that, but you take a look at some of the other movements here.
BULL16|Ripple that's up 35% over the last 24 hours.
BULL17|Tesa up 20%, Litecoin 13%.
NEUT18|So I think we're seeing the follow on trades now where we have not just Bitcoin.
NEUT19|Other words, people are gearing up for the potential to add other coins into the mix.
NEUT20|Now we're not going to see Goldman Sachs selling ether or Litecoin or Cardano to its clients anytime soon, I think, but nevertheless that's the thinking people are loading up now.
NEUT21|Also want to bring everybody's attention to some crypto spot stocks specifically eBay now.
BEAR22|This stock was down 10% yesterday, down another, 12% in premarket trading Hindenburg.
NEUT23|Just ordered a excuse me.
NEUT24|"Issued a short report on it so I haven't had a chance to delve into the details, but I do love a rip roaring good short report guys."""
