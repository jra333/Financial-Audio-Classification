NEUT3|We connect the national used car supply as a one market.
NEUT4|Previously the Beijing customer just about Beijing used car and the lower tier city just by lower tier used car.
BEAR5|But the problem is a supply and demand is quite unbalanced so.
NEUT6|In past several years, we really pay some attention on how to make the digital transparency digital.
NEUT7|The experience online and the national wider logistic and aftersales the standardize and when we build all of infrastructure today we can enable people buying used car online.
