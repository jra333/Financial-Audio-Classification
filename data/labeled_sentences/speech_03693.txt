BULL0|"""Welcome back everybody."
NEUT1|A regulatory filing revealed a slew of changes to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in the third quarter, the Conglomerate bought 2.4 million shares of T-Mobile in the last quarter.
BULL2|It also took on big positions in pharmaceutical school, pharmaceutical stocks including AbbVie, Merck, Pfizer, and Bristol Myers Squibb.
BEAR3|In the meantime, Berkshire trimmed its Apple Stake by three point.
NEUT4|7% Apple, though, remains Berkshires biggest equity holding.
NEUT5|Berkshire also sold most of its position in JP Morgan Chase.
BEAR6|It cut its stake from 22.2 million shares to less than 1,000,000.
BEAR7|Berkshire also dialed back its investment in Wells Fargo, M&T Bank, and PNC Financial, an Berkshire cut.
BULL8|It's relatively new stake in Gold miner, Barrick Gold, by 42%, Joe.
NEUT9|Wish I understood the rationale behind some of those moves which moves.
BEAR10|JP Morgan, I thought this was the time that the banks you know have been hurt and you know it's above book.
NEUT11|Unlike some of the other ones, obviously, but.
NEUT12|I don't know.
BULL13|It seems like we're coming out of something that that would be good, huh?
BULL14|Well, he's built up a huge position in Bank of America.
BULL15|Remember, he's really pushed up his position and he owns more than 11% of that by the mining.
NEUT16|So white gold with him, yeah?
NEUT17|Put him into.
NEUT18|Who is it?
NEUT19|Yeah, who?
NEUT20|What are his moves and it you know, my guess is the Pharmaceuticals were him because it's $5.6 billion.
NEUT21|That's a big position, and that's you know, each of the each Titan Ted each have substantial portfolios, but that would be a massive part of their portfolio.
NEUT22|So my guess would be that the the these these moves that we're looking at right here.
NEUT23|I would guess he and or Charlie.
NEUT24|I would guess that T-Mobile is not him.
NEUT25|I can't imagine that that's him, but I guess I could be wrong on that.
NEUT26|I don't think the gold was him.
NEUT27|I think the gold was either Todd or Ted, so I think that moving their position in the chase little surprising PNC Bank a little surprising.
NEUT28|I know he liked both those banks a lot, but he's also really hugely built up his stake in Bank of America, so I don't think it's a step away from financials overall.
NEUT29|And Apple at such a small.
NEUT30|I mean it's.
NEUT31|Surrounding a very small position.
NEUT32|Yeah, yeah alright, I actually wonder on the Apple if that was even something they did or if that was right you know like sometimes they have moves that they make.
NEUT33|I don't even think it's rebalancing.
NEUT34|I think at times they they end up moving something because you know one of the portfolios for one of the companies that they control.
NEUT35|If you're moving pension funds or something in and out of it.
NEUT36|I I don't know that but having not talked to him at all about this, I was surprised to see the Apple move and my only thought was maybe that was some shuffling somewhere.
NEUT37|I'd be surprised if this is the beginning of some move.
NEUT38|They're making it the dollar commitment to Apple remains just about exactly.
NEUT39|I mean it's up so much that you trim back.
NEUT40|You know, 3 1/2 percent of your of your position and you still have a huge commitment to it.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
