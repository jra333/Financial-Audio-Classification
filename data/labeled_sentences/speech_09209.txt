NEUT0|"""Guys, I'm not gonna lie to you right now."
BEAR1|Black Berry is not looking good.
BEAR2|Still an it really pains me to say that you know what is up.
NEUT3|Guys Steven from craze market trading here if you're new around here welcome to the channel.
NEUT4|If you're returning member welcome back alright, so we're going to talk about BlackBerry today so Black Berry is a company that I think we all know of right?
NEUT5|I mean they've been around the kind of tech industry since it's been a thing.
NEUT6|If you weren't around to, you know, be around somewhere.
NEUT7|The BlackBerry phone, your parents for sure were BlackBerry was once the Apple.
NEUT8|Of the phone industry, they were massive back like 20 years ago and recently BlackBerry has been having quite the popularity run in my opinion, BlackBerry has kind of a pretty big market cap on the phone industry as far as things go, so I personally think that BlackBerry is somewhat undervalued, but maybe I'm wrong on that.
NEUT9|But personally that's what I believe.
BEAR10|They seem extremely undervalued whenever it comes to things.
NEUT11|For example, BlackBerry is a 15% market share of the phone industry.
NEUT12|Which doesn't really sound like a lot, but whenever you think of how many people buy phones in America, that is quite a bit 15% of a multibillion dollar industry is pretty crazy.
BEAR13|So that is kind of sad to see that BlackBerry is so undervalued at the moment they were getting to what I would think is Blackberries value, which is around 50 to $60.00, but they've been having a sell off because the media is trying to make us believe that black Berry is a dead stock.
NEUT14|Do not listen to that guys.
NEUT15|I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT16|But I'm personally going to be holding.
BULL17|I think BlackBerry could jump right back up to $25 anytime now is not going to be as soon as tomorrow, but I see tomorrow could be a very Green Day for BlackBerry.
BEAR18|Since we've been having multiple red days.
BEAR19|Really ***** to see BlackBerry get, you know, shot down like this.
NEUT20|It's honestly disgusting to see all these big corporations and big companies and people with multi billions of dollars destroy company that is, you know so well off in the tech industry right now.
BULL21|I think we could see BlackBerry back up to $15.00 tomorrow as it is sitting at 12.
NEUT22|Dollars right now, but I don't think it's going to hit a $25 price target as soon as you know next week.
BULL23|I think within this month it'll be back up to 25, but hey, that is just my opinion.
