BEAR0|"""The first three months of 2020 were a horror show in markets."
NEUT1|Investors went into the year thinking it was going to be pretty quiet and unspectacular, with decent but unremarkable returns.
BEAR2|Big stock markets were at record highs as recently as February, which seems an age ago.
NEUT3|Now.
NEUT4|Then, of course, coronavirus came along.
BEAR5|The scale of the disruption to investors is really hard to exaggerate.
BEAR6|Wall Street stocks dropped into a bear market at the fastest ever pace, and they ended the quarter down 20%, even including a 15% rally from the lowest point of the year.
BEAR7|UK stocks had the worst run since 1987, which is not exactly a vintage year.
BEAR8|The dollar squeezed higher, which is bad news for countries and companies around the world that have dollar debts, and perhaps most alarmingly.
BEAR9|The government bond market started to malfunction.
NEUT10|COVID-19 is a health crisis first and foremost and the response locking down communities, cities and countries around the world produces an economic crisis too.
BEAR11|In mid March, it also appeared to be producing a financial crisis.
BEAR12|The financial system itself was getting sick.
NEUT13|Central banks and governments can do what they can to help the health crisis and to soothe the economic shock.
BULL14|But they did step in in force to help the markets and it has worked at least to some degree.
NEUT15|Markets are generally much, now, but is it's time to step back into risky bets.
NEUT16|Well, investors are not so sure as one put it to me this week.
NEUT17|It's too late to sell, but it's too early to buy.
NEUT18|Bargain hunters are out there.
NEUT19|Some hedge funds are raising money to bet that the worst has passed.
NEUT20|But picking a bargain is tricky.
NEUT21|It relies on assumptions about companies earnings and right now that stuff.
NEUT22|In addition, no one honestly knows how this virus is going to play out or how it's going to work in the USA.
BEAR23|Bounce back in Market is definitely possible, but more likely is a slow grind lower from here.
BEAR24|That's better than the 10% daily drops we were seeing at one point, but it's still not pretty.
BEAR25|Debt defaults by companies and emerging market countries are now seen as all but inevitable.
NEUT26|"Investing now is not so much about picking winners as picking survivors."""
