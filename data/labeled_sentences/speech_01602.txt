NEUT0|"""Crypto secret circle."
NEUT1|Thank you.
BEAR2|People have given up on Bitcoin Cash.
NEUT3|But it's about to be integrated into kim.com's new app, end of Q1.
NEUT4|BCH will take off.
NEUT5|I love talking metrics OK Bill, could you maybe pull up Bitcoin cash?
BULL6|Certainly happy, happy.
NEUT7|So the interesting thing about Bitcoin cash.
NEUT8|Other than the fact that no one likes it.
NEUT9|Is that?
NEUT10|Is that Bitcoin cash is a part of what I am going to start calling the possibility of like?
NEUT11|I don't know there I say it, but could I call it like the Bitcoin rebellion, right?
NEUT12|In other words, if you were wallstreetbets right and you wanted to just take the crypto world by storm, so this is big coin cash, say on a three day chart.
NEUT13|Let's just say you wanted to just make an impact, but you didn't.
NEUT14|You weren't big enough to move Bitcoin itself.
NEUT15|Well, what would you do?
NEUT16|Well, you would just go to another part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
NEUT17|Particularly something like Bitcoin cash with it was like a rebellious controversial figure at the head of it.
NEUT18|Roger ver.
NEUT19|And you would take it and you would just move it 'cause again.
NEUT20|This is on PayPal OK, Coinbase.
NEUT21|If Bitcoin is going at 250 K like some people think.
NEUT22|Where do you think a peer to peer payment system like Bitcoin Cash is going to go?
NEUT23|Right, and they've done nothing but sell this thing.
NEUT24|During January, nothing would sell this thing all the way down to wait.
NEUT25|The 62% retracement.
NEUT26|Of the recent rally back from September.
NEUT27|So when the 62% line holds.
NEUT28|It's bullish.
NEUT29|Anne, frankly.
NEUT30|Bitcoin took out its all time high and then some East went to its all time high.
NEUT31|I don't see why Bitcoin Cash can't trade back in 1500.
NEUT32|I mean, it only takes one tweet or one public or one post from these Wall Street.
NEUT33|Bet guys to say, hey, let's jump in and Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.
NEUT34|It's basically a different version of Bitcoin, except we can just moon it and everyone short it and no one likes it.
NEUT35|It's right up there out.
NEUT36|So that's my two cents on Bitcoin cash.
NEUT37|A real sleeper.
