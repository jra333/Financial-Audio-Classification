NEUT0|"""Alright, let's take a look at some traction for Palantir."
BULL1|The ticker symbol PLT are alright.
NEUT2|So in my last video I had this falling wedge going down something like this.
BEAR3|We have been getting resistance on this trend line right here.
NEUT4|Pretty much all right here and right here.
NEUT5|So I was talking about how I thought I was going about to break to the upside and so I put in an order somewhere around here and we actually did end up breaking to the upside.
BEAR6|But it looks like we're getting a little bit of rejection right here.
NEUT7|Right away.
NEUT8|I was noticing that.
NEUT9|You could have also drawn a falling wedge going something like this as well.
NEUT10|And what happened is it broke out of this falling wedge and it got rejected right here.
NEUT11|So basically what we did is remove the trend line.
NEUT12|I'm wondering if basically we're just going to be moving the trendline again, alright?
NEUT13|So let's take a look at the moving averages we broke out of that hourly moving average right here.
NEUT14|We were trading up, and that's pretty much when I put in the order and so.
BULL15|We broke that trend line going up and we had to move up here, but as you can see we kind of came into this 180 moving average and got some resistance.
NEUT16|So we kind of been pushing down but the one thing I do want you to show you is that if you go to the daily you can see this moving average been going like this.
BEAR17|We had been moving down 'cause we were under it and then we broke above it.
BEAR18|I've got a small move up but we got rejected and we got pushed back down right here.
NEUT19|We actually broke above it.
NEUT20|And what I do like is that we broke above it and then we came down and tested it.
BULL21|We actually haven't gone that bounce yet, but we did test it and got a bounce up a little bit.
BULL22|I guess we'll see what happens on Monday if we can get in a real bounce off this and continue to move up if we break this though, I think that we're going to continue to move down and maybe retest this trendline.
NEUT23|Alright, so in general let me show you what I'm watching.
NEUT24|We got this 180 moving average coming in right here and that.
NEUT25|That resistance looks about like at $24.00.
NEUT26|So I'm looking at the resistance right here at around $24.00.
BULL27|I'm looking at this trendline moving up.
NEUT28|If we break that trend line I'm I close my position.
NEUT29|If if we go to the daily what I want to see us is bounce off this.
NEUT30|This moving average right here and what I would like to see is if you get this moving average, get it like this.
BULL31|I want to see that price bounce off this on Monday and continue to move up even if we just get like a small green candle going something like that and we close like that on Monday that'll look bullish.
NEUT32|But that's basically what I'm watching.
NEUT33|If there's any stocks you guys want me to look at, let me know in the comments.
NEUT34|Or if there's any stocks you guys want an update on, let me know if you guys like that video.
