NEUT2|0 In the previous video I have described why the market should crash and told about the possibilities about a crash in 2020.
NEUT3|In this video I want to share a secret which the rich people can do so that the market would crash and they would come out as winners.
BEAR4|We know that most investors are shorting most of their positions.
NEUT5|Buffett hasn't invested in 2020, instead he sold all his airlines stake.
NEUT6|Before getting into the video, let's see what shorting or short selling means.
BEAR7|For example, if an investor thinks that Tesla stock is overvalued at $625 per share, an is going to drop in price.
NEUT8|The investor may borrow 10 shares of Tesla from their broker, who then sells it for the current market price of $625.
NEUT9|If the stock goes down to $500, the investor could buy the 10 shares back at this price, return the shares to their broker, and net a profit of $1250.
NEUT10|However, if the Tesla price rises to $700.00, the investor would lose $750.
NEUT11|This was the easiest example I found out there.
NEUT12|I've linked the article where you can read more about it in the description below.
NEUT13|Bill Ackman made a $2.6 billion by shorting look at this.
NEUT14|Short sellers made $500 billion in profit.
NEUT15|Astonishing right?
NEUT16|So you can see the potential.
NEUT17|It's too risky, but is probably worth in the current volatile market, but never recommended what the billionaires.
NEUT18|And the rich investor can do is something called pump and dump stocks.
NEUT19|Most investors would know this, but this is illegal.
NEUT20|What actually happens in this technique is that the value of the stock price is artificially inflated or deflated, making the stock price go up or down.
NEUT21|We know that the stock price goes up when there are lots of buyers and the stock price goes down when there is lots of selling what these billionaires can do is the same.
BEAR22|They can eventually sell most of their stocks without our consent and make the price of stock fall.
NEUT23|Because they have shorted their position, they can make a profit in millions and then invest back into the company making even more profit.
NEUT24|People who know about Jordan Belford alias the Wolf of Wall Street would know about this.
NEUT25|He used to use this same trick and make money.
BEAR26|He later went to prison and made lots of investors lose most or all of their earnings.
NEUT27|But this is illegal and dangerous.
BULL28|I'm not sure, but there is a slight chance that they can do.
BEAR29|Recently Ellon Musk tweeted that Tesla stocks are high, which made stock price come crashing within minutes.
BEAR30|Later he was fined for his tweet.
NEUT31|Tesla is currently trading at a higher price, but who knows what billionaires can do.
NEUT32|They literally control most.
NEUT33|Thank you for watching.
NEUT34|"Please share it with one friend."""
