NEUT0|"""Welcome to the FT market minute."
NEUT1|Here's what we're watching in London on Wednesday morning.
BEAR2|Well, one measure of global stocks, the Footsie all World Index is back at record highs, despite many investors taking Fed Chair Janet Yellen's latest comments as more hawkish than expected.
BULL3|Now, Wall Street makes up more than 50% of your world, so it struggled to record levels is a big driver of the rally, but European and Asian markets with multi month peaks two and even emerging markets have had a good run of light.
BULL4|Now of course, equity bulls have been able to shrug off the prospect of higher borrowing costs.
BULL5|Because they are seen as coming in response to quicker growth.
BULL6|That's how the all world mining and materials sectors, which have risen by around 20% since the US election in November.
NEUT7|Another course of the bull run, our hopes for less US regulation, especially in the financial sector.
BULL8|And banks should also benefit from those rising rates.
BULL9|No surprise, then, that the All World Banking Index is up 16% since Mr. Trump's victory monetary policy could still deliver risk, however, or if the Fed is considered behind the curve and struggling to catch up.
NEUT10|"So watch out for the US inflation and retail sales data due on Wednesday."""
