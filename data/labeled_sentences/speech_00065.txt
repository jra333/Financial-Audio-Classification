NEUT0|"""Guys, so today I'm going to be giving my honest price share prediction for NIO stock in the coming days, specifically tomorrow, which is an important day."
BEAR1|So recently we just found out that NAL stock is doing a huge share offering $1.3 billion to be exact, which caused the price to plummet after hours one from $64 all the way down to 59 as lowest so well on analysts have been predicting that tomorrow, Tuesday the 12th will be a red day.
NEUT2|But I feel that a lot of people who missed out on a huge share drum Monday will be buying enought this dip and possibly.
NEUT3|The price share because of this buy in could reach $70.00.
NEUT4|I'm going to take out four grand to buy myself a car because I'm 16 now and what's left in my buying power.
NEUT5|I think I'm just going to buy more Neo calls probably long term not super long term.
NEUT6|Maybe for a month or two.
NEUT7|So I'm gonna show you guys my position right now.
NEUT8|OK guys, so here's My Portfolio.
BULL9|As you can see we are up 1.2 K in the past week so obviously check My Portfolio past month I've just been holding on the carnival like actual stocks and hasn't been doing ****.
NEUT10|Just been flat as **** until I got my neo options.
BEAR11|Yeah you see that it started out bit rough and we were down quite a bit but I knew that if they held on long enough it'll go up.
NEUT12|And this was this was Monday literally jumped.
BULL13|In like we reached 4.5 K, which is incredible and I was thinking about selling Brazil.
NEUT14|What if it gets to 70?
NEUT15|You would've, yeah, but you know.
BEAR16|Obviously it ******* it dipped after everybody cell.
NEUT17|So.
NEUT18|Let's see, so here my here my positions I've got these options right here.
NEUT19|So as you can see, $58 call I loaned 800 from my dad and now it's down to $590.00.
BEAR20|So if we click on this position we can see we are down $255 which you know.
NEUT21|That that's probably gonna be one I'm gonna be holding till 70.
NEUT22|Of course I can't sell on the right.
NEUT23|Why would I do that $54.00 call we have two buys, expiring the end of this week.
NEUT24|Kind of kind of scary.
NEUT25|That's why I want to get these.
NEUT26|I want to sell these as soon as possible.
BULL27|So obviously we are up $900.
NEUT28|Lovely.
NEUT29|We love to see it and our 52.5 dollar call which I bought when it dipped.
NEUT30|When did it?
NEUT31|Did playing around?
NEUT32|Round here, I think it was.
BULL33|So we're up $583 in total return.
NEUT34|Love to see it.
NEUT35|Love to see it.
NEUT36|So that those are my positions.
NEUT37|My prediction for Neo's share price tomorrow.
BULL38|I think early in the morning we can get up to $70.00.
NEUT39|Because I mean a lot of people that were waiting till after Neo Day waking up and then oh Fox $64 sell off some people bought here and then went back up.
BEAR40|And then you know sell offs in morning trade sideways for a bit and now it's down.
NEUT41|After this you share offering.
BEAR42|So I'm feeling that a lot of people who missed out on this part right here are going to be ******* copying guys.
NEUT43|Everybody's going to be buying so I'm thinking this could.
BEAR44|This could fluctuate the share price all the way up to $70.00 which I will be exiting all my positions.
NEUT45|And yeah, like I said, taking out the four grants I can buy my witness her thanks to Neo anyway, guys.
BULL46|Hope you enjoyed this video drop a like for the YouTube algorithm so we can get some more views.
BULL47|"Thanks a lot."""
