BULL0|"""Litecoin is one of the most popular cryptocurrencies in the world."
NEUT1|Out of the more than 6000 different crypto coins in circulation in terms of market cap, like when ranks ninth with a market cap of about $13 billion.
NEUT2|In this video I'll explain to you why Litecoin has the potential to skyrocket in 2021.
NEUT3|If it's your first time here, welcome every day.
NEUT4|I post new videos except when I have enough date, which doesn't happen too often.
NEUT5|I make updates on stocks and other cryptocurrencies, so hit the subscribe button for that.
NEUT6|Tomorrow live here's what's up.
BULL7|Welcome back.
BULL8|Thanks for being here with that being said, this jump right into the video.
NEUT9|Let's talk money.
NEUT10|Like home was launched in 2011 and it's one of the oldest cryptocurrencies, 10 years old Masonic along time ago, but to put things in perspective, Bitcoin.
NEUT11|But consider the OG was only launched two years prior to Litecoin, so naturally being from the same era there will be some similarities between the two.
NEUT12|The founder of Litecoin is Charlie.
NEUT13|His vision was to create the silver to bitcoins.
BULL14|Gold, like when adopted many of the features of Bitcoin that Lee and the other developers felt were working well for the earlier cryptocurrency.
BULL15|And change some other aspects that development team felt could be improved.
NEUT16|The most fundamental technical difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin are the different cryptographic algorithms that they employ.
NEUT17|Bitcoin makes use of the SHA 256 algorithm, whereas like point makes use of a completely new algorithm known as script script, which again is used by Litecoin, is generally a more efficient algorithm for mining cryptocurrency.
NEUT18|Doodle how it is designed to prevent too much customization with hardware solutions script.
NEUT19|Unlike SH 8056, favors high speed random access memory.
NEUT20|It is for this reason like once.
NEUT21|Algorithm makes it easier for regular cryptocurrency users to participate in mining without too much complexity.
NEUT22|Staying true to its name.
NEUT23|Litecoin is lighter when it comes to transaction fees, as I'm making this video like one has an average transaction fee of around three to four cents.
NEUT24|Let's talk about investing well.
NEUT25|I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT26|You should always do your own due diligence.
NEUT27|I think Litecoin have stuck around for a long time for a reason.
NEUT28|One huge positive for Litecoin is how easy it is to get your hands on it.
NEUT29|It's trading on pretty much any major crypto exchange.
NEUT30|Including Robin Hood, which is a huge huge deal for me.
NEUT31|I have a theory and again just my theory.
NEUT32|Not saying that's a fact or backed up by anything.
NEUT33|But if George Crum wasn't trained on Robin Hood, I don't think it would have gained as much mainstream attention.
NEUT34|Litecoin is currently trading around $205.00.
BEAR35|Which is still nowhere near its all time high of $360.00.
BULL36|In recent months, we've seen most of the highly adopted crypto currencies hit new all time highs, and I think something similar will happen with like one at some point in 2021.
NEUT37|At the very least, I predict Litecoin will be traded in the three hundreds, again, just last month Litecoin was trained as high as $250, buying like 1 right now in the low two hundreds.
NEUT38|It's like getting a 20% discount in my opinion and conclusion, Litecoin does not.
NEUT39|As volatile as other coins, but it is a much safer corn.
NEUT40|"As I don't see it going away anytime soon, lower is slower reward."""
