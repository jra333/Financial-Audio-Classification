BEAR0|"""Starbucks is lower in early trading and this morning, as US comps down five in the first quarter, following some tighter covid restrictions joining us this morning, first on CNBC."
BULL1|We're always pleased to welcome Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson.
BULL2|KJ welcome back.
BULL3|Good to see you good morning, good morning.
NEUT4|How are you guys this morning?
BULL5|Trying to hang in there, it's a pleasure to talk to you about the quarter.
BULL6|Down five is certainly better than down 9 prior.
NEUT7|Is there a sense that it could have been even better if maybe the January restrictions hadn't popped up again?
NEUT8|Well, you know.
BULL9|Certainly, it's it's another quarter of sequential progress, and you know, I'd say the overall recovery is unfolding as we had forecasted.
BULL10|You know, China posted a positive 5% comp in the quarter.
BULL11|the US showed sequential improvement going from minus nine in the previous quarter to minus 5%.
BULL12|And certainly that could have been even better.
BULL13|Carl, as you point out, given the fact that we had this resurgence of of the spread of Covid late in the quarter, and you know, we had to.
BEAR14|We had to eliminate a lot of the limited seating indoor seating in our stores, and so that had an impact.
NEUT15|But you know, we we have this operationalized where we can.
NEUT16|We can monitor and adapt, store by store to whatever is unfolding.
BULL17|And I think as we disclosed yesterday, you know, January on US was is looking like it's coming in at a -- 2% comp so.
NEUT18|You know this this recovery is not linear week by week, but quarter by quarter.
BULL19|You know we're tracking to the to the recovery that we had forecasted.
NEUT20|You know several months ago.
NEUT21|Right, we've talked to you for a long time about traffic and it's not.
NEUT22|It's not endemic just to Starbucks, but quick service in general.
BEAR23|How do you get traffic back up transactions down 21 even though average ticket was way up?
BEAR24|Is there a sense that that transactions are bottoming at these levels?
NEUT25|Well, you know what's happening right now.
NEUT26|Carl is is customers are looking for experiences that are safe, familiar and convenient.
NEUT27|And so when they come to Starbucks, you know, in many ways their their their placing group orders.
NEUT28|They're buying multiple beverages, multiple food items, and that's because you know they're buying.
NEUT29|You know either for their their family, or you know their work.
NEUT30|Colleagues, you know, whatever it's it's driving ticket up an transactions down an as as we get through this pandemic, and you know the vaccination process starts to unfold.
BULL31|We're going to see that normalize a bit more.
NEUT32|You know transactions are good are going to start to go back up once we get back into a more normal routine.
BULL33|You know, ticket will come down, but we still think ticket is going to have some positive long term.
NEUT34|You know, upside as we look to the future.
BULL35|But right now, what we're seeing is, you know, customers continue to group order an we've increased throughput at drive-thru and curbside, and mobile order, and that's working.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
