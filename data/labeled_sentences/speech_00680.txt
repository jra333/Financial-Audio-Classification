NEUT0|"""Peter, the only thing dominating markets is a question."
NEUT1|If this relief bill actually brings inflation in a couple of weeks, what does it mean for a month?
NEUT2|Once they're dished out of what does it mean for your equity strategy forecast?
BULL3|While we are overall still positive on equity, so we think the Free Castle you'll forward is still around 5 1/2%, so that's pretty attractive given what you offered elsewhere.
BULL4|So we are very constructive on equities and we think the next 18 months will provide solid growth.
NEUT5|We had now have the new stimulus bill from the US, will have to China.
BULL6|We think also doing more fiscal stimulus later into the year when their base effects kick in and their economic growth numbers.
NEUT7|You look a little bit less rosy and then they will do something.
BULL8|So we think we should still be overweight equities, but within that framework, with the rising inflationary precious rising prices, higher interest rates, we think we could go to 2 1/2 percent when the output gap is close in the US by the end of the year when we get through on that journey to 2 1/2 percent, the rich pockets of technology stocks which have richly valued will be very sensitive to these rising interest rates because it lifted discount rate of their future cash flows, which are fine to the future.
NEUT9|And that's the result.
NEUT10|We think this divergent right now that we're seeing between.
BULL11|S&P 500 an S 100 continue.
NEUT12|Peter, where is the biggest bubble and when will it burst?
NEUT13|While the biggest bubbles we currently looking at I think is within green technology, it's also within what we define as bubble stocks.
BEAR14|So companies within enterprise value to sales above 10 and negative earnings forecasts.
NEUT15|You could argue some areas within the US biotechnology sector or industry if you will is also look quite bubbly.
NEUT16|That's part of the whole arc.
NEUT17|Invest an organization, ETF complex.
NEUT18|Those sorts of places.
NEUT19|Very interest rate sensitive here in this short in the short term, but long term a lot of these technology stocks will continue to do quite well, we think because the long term driver of any company in any stock prices, you know earnings growth and revenue growth and that is still in the technology space.
BEAR20|But short term here we have a lot of trouble.
BULL21|I think with these rising interest rates.
NEUT22|Peter, you just said you think that the divergent between the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P is going to continue.
BEAR23|I was showing a chart just a little bit ago with the NASDAQ kind of pulling away from the S&P.
BEAR24|Obviously it's had its issues with rates rising and that scare.
NEUT25|But here you see it again.
NEUT26|The NASDAQ 100 in blue, the S&P in yellow.
BEAR27|You expect the NASDAQ to continue outperforming.
BULL28|Now what I mean is that the when we crossed the one point 2% in the US 10 year, it was very clear that the interest rate sensitivity sensitivity was kicking in among bubble stocks.
NEUT29|And there's like 100.
BEAR30|Where is there some P500 was holding up pretty well now we had an all time high in the close yesterday and then P 500 is still down on the close, around 5 1/2% of the NASDAQ 100.
BULL31|Today you're seeing the US 10 year yield creeping back to 1.6% of the interest rate sensitivity is kicking in again, and now you're seeing that divergent.
NEUT32|So nasty.
BEAR33|Underperforming the S&P 500 and in Europe and the likes, we think that diversion that will continue as we move towards those 2 1/2% because a lot of the internals of equity valuation will have to adjust to these higher discount rates.
NEUT34|And when we have closed output gap and we go through that 2 1/2% then we can talk really long term again.
NEUT35|And then I think the technology sector is still a place where you want to be be overweight.
BEAR36|"But on this journey to 2 1/2% that will be there will be a bumpy ride for some pockets of the technology space."""
