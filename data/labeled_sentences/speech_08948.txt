BULL0|"""There is a lot of excitement sparked earlier in the week after workers reported that Apple was looking at creating an electric autonomous vehicle, not around the corner, but maybe 2024-2025."
NEUT1|There's been a lot of takes on it now.
NEUT2|There's another one.
NEUT3|Brian sozzi.
NEUT4|I believe there is a Goldman note out on the potential I car.
NEUT5|Well, Julie, I promise I do other things here at Yahoo Finance than speculate on the Apple I car.
NEUT6|This is the only thing I seem to be talking about this week and with good reason, Goldman Sachs, Apple analyst, Rod Hall.
NEUT7|Out with a note this morning.
NEUT8|Looking at the financial impact of Apple releases, A2025I car or the Apple Mobile is Jared Blicker is coin did hear the basic numbers 'cause I don't want to fall asleep here.
BULL9|If if Apple is able to grab 5% market share up the EV market with a $75,000 car, that's what I call it.
BULL10|They will only see a 3% bump to their earnings and not big.
NEUT11|That's not a big bump.
NEUT12|The best case scenario which assumes Apple grabs a 7% market share of the EV of the EV industry and they sell $100,000 I car which would put it more in competition with the high end Tesla models.
BULL13|A 7% bump in EPS.
NEUT14|So the Apple Bulls are probably wondering here.
NEUT15|Hey Brian, Apple is going to be selling a lot of electric cars.
BULL16|Yeah, earnings boom sales boom.
NEUT17|It doesn't work that way in the reality is it doesn't work that way because.
NEUT18|The auto industry.
BEAR19|Julie, as you all know is very low margin.
NEUT20|You look at the margins, the operating margins at Ford General Motors.
NEUT21|These are single digit businesses.
NEUT22|Apple has essentially minted money for decades because they sell iPads, iPhones and these products are made by outside suppliers and they meant money off of these things.
NEUT23|Apples margins are two, three, four times the automaker.
NEUT24|So the auto business is a completely different ball game altogether.
NEUT25|Which seems to suggest Brian Sozzi.
NEUT26|Maybe you've just convinced me that Apple Lincoln really do this.
NEUT27|You know this, this would not be a classic playbook for Apple.
NEUT28|It wouldn't be, but I do think you talked to this.
NEUT29|A lot of folks on the street and they do think Apple could potentially team up with the likes of Tesla.
NEUT30|They can work deeper with the Volkswagen, but Hall makes a very good point in the bottom of this note, he said the reason why Apple would want to get into this market because a lot more people will be spending more time in driverless cars.
BULL31|That vision that Jetson type lifestyle appears to be finally coming to fruition.
NEUT32|An Apple with its big giant balance sheet and its technology browse, they may want a piece of that market.
NEUT33|Maybe we'll see, but there are a lot of assumptions built into that.
NEUT34|Goldman note as well, right?
NEUT35|"Shrug, that's the emoji of the year I think."""
