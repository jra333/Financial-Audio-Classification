NEUT0|"""I want to have about 30 shares of this stock before it goes past $190.00."
NEUT1|That's my goal.
NEUT2|Disney IP owed in 1957, but as of 2021 its share price stands about 100 and $890.00 per share.
BULL3|Having cleared its all time high and confidently has more to offer.
NEUT4|I'll explain what my price predictions are, but on and explain why.
NEUT5|First, the first thing to remember is that Disney is at this share price during a worldwide pandemic.
BEAR6|The theme parks are closed and Disney's cruise liners aren't even operating as the world goes post pandemic.
NEUT7|Expect the revenue growth for these streams to really pick up and the one big Disney hit we all know about is the Mandalorian series.
BULL8|It has the potential to draw in more users to subscribe to their streaming services this year.
BULL9|Disney wants to expand its streaming services to Eastern Europe, South Korea, Hong Kong, and other markets.
BULL10|It's growing its viewership now.
NEUT11|The next figures really important.
NEUT12|I want you to listen to this.
NEUT13|Disney expects to have 230 to 260 million subscribers by 2024.
NEUT14|In comparison, Netflix is only going to have about 195 million.
NEUT15|This growth rate is one of a kind.
NEUT16|Now imagine getting in before all this growth happens.
BULL17|The share price is going to appreciate as more subscribers enroll.
BULL18|Now the last earnings were a really good sign.
BEAR19|This is because the theme parks that were closed dropped revenue by about 53% to 3.59 billion.
BULL20|But the direct to consumer revenues, which basically means any sort of streaming services jumped 73% to 3.5 billion.
NEUT21|And don't forget this is one key advantage that Disney has.
NEUT22|The other streaming services don't they actually possess the rights to the products?
NEUT23|That they're actually creating the streaming services for such as Star Wars and Marvel Disney has an unmatched library of intellectual property at his disposal.
NEUT24|The fan base for these are huge and the product sales that follow from these shows actually all go to Disney as well.
NEUT25|Just remember the past year was just the beginning.
BULL26|Disney is looking to roll more and more shows and movies from Marvel and Pixar, which going to be exclusive to Disney Plus and at the same time is expanding to other countries.
BULL27|They're going to continue their current movie franchise by having more releases such as Frozen 2 Toy stories in the Marvel Universe.
NEUT28|Disney owns Hulu and ESPN.
NEUT29|And don't forget, ESPN has been a Disney cash cow for years, just like every other stock.
BULL30|Disney was hit hard by the pandemic last March, but he exceeded its original all time high, proving itself each time their earning report show revenue is increasing their share price is also going to be positively impacted.
NEUT31|Other companies like Costco, Amazon and Netflix.
BULL32|They all use the subscription model and they've shown how successful it can be.
NEUT33|There's no avoiding fact 10 to 50 years from now.
NEUT34|Marvel Movies, Disney characters.
BULL35|These theme parks that we're going to have a substantial impact.
NEUT36|And no one is going to be quick to forget it, and this is a key selling point for me.
NEUT37|Disney is an ideal combination of stay at home and re opening stock all-in-one.
BULL38|I only see positive news coming for Disney as we move into that post pandemic life.
BULL39|Historically we can see since 2010 it's had huge growth.
BEAR40|Its biggest gaining it had over a 50% gain and only two years had negative share growth and they were so miniscule there was 0.03 and 0.82.
NEUT41|And what this means for me is although past performance can be indicative of future performance.
BULL42|It means I will be buying the dips because I think it's going to be successful.
BULL43|There's more growth happening now based on the current subscription and revenue growth rate.
NEUT44|In my opinion, we could see a $200 Disney by the end of Q three 2021 and going into Q three 2022 we could see a $230 Disney but let me know what you guys think.
NEUT45|Do you own Disney or do you think the share price is going to be?
NEUT46|"Comment below guys and as always stay informed."""
