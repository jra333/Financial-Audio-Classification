NEUT0|"""George Floyd's daughter Gigi now owns a piece of Disney."
BULL1|Thanks to Barbra Streisand.
NEUT2|Wow, the six year old posed with a letter from the singer on Instagram as well as the official certificate from Disney.
NEUT3|It's not clear how many shares Gigi was gifted.
NEUT4|Disney stock Price sits at about $115.00 a share.
NEUT5|Touring what do you make of this gift as opposed to cash right?
NEUT6|And I was thinking a lot about this 'cause I would think why doesn't she just want cash for a little girl?
NEUT7|Disney Right is a smart move to be super honest.
NEUT8|I've been thinking about that just to have some.
NEUT9|Involvement in being part of getting the Certificate of Disney.
NEUT10|That probably meant more to her than some cash, so Barbra Streisand has a new grandchild, Anne.
NEUT11|I think she's probably thinking on that level an I was a little rushed to judgment before when I said just give her cash.
NEUT12|What is this?
NEUT13|I think this was probably more special at this point.
BULL14|Yeah, and it's still sorry.
NEUT15|I disagree.
NEUT16|I disagree.
NEUT17|I disagree.
NEUT18|I do look let me let me tell you that.
NEUT19|Did you guys ever get cards for your birthday from Grandma?
NEUT20|What came out of it when you opened it?
NEUT21|Money or a check?
NEUT22|Not shares?
NEUT23|No little kid once shares coming out of their birthday card.
NEUT24|They want money.
NEUT25|They want checks.
NEUT26|Cut a check Barbara at that little girl can't see shares they can she can see she can see a couple of greenbacks in there though.
NEUT27|"Come on."""
