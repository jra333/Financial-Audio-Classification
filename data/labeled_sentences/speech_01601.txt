BEAR0|"""Hey everybody might say no more here from Traders Circle AKA precise 26."
BEAR1|Right now I am looking at the Bitcoin chart BTC USD and it's been a while since I looked at this, but now that I am looking at it we can see there's been a crazy tumble.
NEUT2|I'm just going to erase some of these lines here, get rid of a lot of that.
NEUT3|OK actually, will just get rid of all of them and I'll just make the lines right now.
NEUT4|So what I've been waiting for ever since my previous analysis is.
NEUT5|Is the brakes of these lines.
NEUT6|We need the brakes of these lines in order to take a bullish.
BULL7|A bullish position.
NEUT8|I'm looking at these guitar strings and you can see they've never weakened up there very strong bear, so we're going to continue bear for awhile here now, people.
BEAR9|Hopefully you're not stuck in positions.
NEUT10|If you do have coins.
NEUT11|I don't know.
NEUT12|I think you should just hold them this.
NEUT13|This isn't going to last forever.
NEUT14|This is going to catch some people off guard when it's done, because then it's just going to fly.
BULL15|OK, so right now we can see we have broken out of our original support.
NEUT16|Then we had another support which we seem to have passed by as well.
NEUT17|And now there's not really much of a support there to stop, except for maybe this.
NEUT18|So I expect we will be going down some more to this area here.
NEUT19|To the 7500 area.
BEAR20|And if that breaks, it's it's getting dicey.
NEUT21|We might see 3100.
BULL22|OK, let's let's hope that doesn't happen, or if it does, that's great because it's just going to give us a way to buy cheap Bitcoin.
NEUT23|This is this is not going to last.
NEUT24|People believe me this is not going to last.
NEUT25|There's lots of investors out there.
BULL26|They're going to want to capitalize on this very low price.
NEUT27|OK, I would like to see something change in the guitar strings here, right?
BULL28|I'd like to see us reject on the support.
NEUT29|And a break of the resistance is in order for me to decide that this is bullish.
NEUT30|I am definitely keeping an eye on the RVI, the relative vigor index.
BULL31|Once this breaks, that will be probably our first sign of reversal.
NEUT32|So we're watching for that.
NEUT33|The other indicators don't tell us much, except for the fact that it's still bearish, so we're just going to wait this out an.
NEUT34|I guess some people could sure, but I wouldn't short here.
NEUT35|There's no break or anything here to sort from, so we're just going to wait till we hit this support area and see what happens.
NEUT36|From there you could always put a pending order below the short because this is bearish.
NEUT37|You definitely want to go short.
NEUT38|Not long, no lawns, only shorts an.
NEUT39|From there we can always put the pending above.
NEUT40|Here you can put a pending above this line here, but it's definitely more risky.
NEUT41|Your target would be this, but we will most likely get rejected on this for a third bounce.
NEUT42|We need a third bounce on this line, so I'm expecting that to come anytime.
NEUT43|It's hard to say when it's going to happen.
NEUT44|I don't speak for time, so I'll just watch for that.
BULL45|OK, hopefully this was helpful.
