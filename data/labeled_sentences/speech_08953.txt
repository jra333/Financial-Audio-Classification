NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, it's a Giacomo speaking."
NEUT1|Thanks for watching this quick video on Apple Apple.
NEUT2|There is not a lot to say as we can see as being performing very well and even without my any of technical analysis, just using a simple exponential moving average, it is the most trustworthy tool tools in technical analysis we can see that has been performing very well since since.
NEUT3|April and now it's just moving sideways.
NEUT4|It's just posing ability before going up again, so the idea with that again in technical analysis is just to go longer.
NEUT5|Aiming this target price of 140 U.S. dollars with a little bit more technical analysis with this red line is to measure this.
NEUT6|The trend line.
NEUT7|It is almost parallel to the exponential moving average and the blue line is the major trend is very easy.
NEUT8|Is this this a trend line is very strong trendline that's been violated once.
NEUT9|I mean, this one was is just the market is pushing now.
BEAR10|So this is kind of weakness.
NEUT11|Signal of course, but I think it's more posing before resuming its uptrend.
NEUT12|So the idea is as we are right now we are inside this channel with.
BULL13|With this slope is going again afterward, again giving a signal of strength of this market.
NEUT14|So as we are.
NEUT15|And now with Apple, is idea is to invest.
NEUT16|Following the manager then so is to go long and it seems that this is right time to go longer.
BULL17|Even because, again, the exponential moving averages been broken up toward.
NEUT18|So the idea is to go along with the first target price of 125 years dollar and the second one 135 U.S. dollar.
BEAR19|I think even bigger watch afterwards because there is this stochastic that is or in oversold.
NEUT20|So it's in my mean that the stock there is still an opportunity to stock and go down a little bit before going up again.
NEUT21|So for a short time investment, perhaps just.
NEUT22|It's just an old, but for a long term investment is is a long position.
NEUT23|School is really long position.
NEUT24|I think that in the next weeks so people can start going up again or at least moving inside the channel and so reaching 125 going down again.
NEUT25|Then up, you know, just just they need to find a little bit of more equilibrium or stability.
BULL26|Once that Biden has been announced as new lines new president by think that this is good news.
BULL27|For older American markets, and I think that the stock will start going up even be 'cause Apple's car relationship with China.
NEUT28|Older phones are made in China and there will be much of a big massive market in China and with by then.
BULL29|I believe there will be much better relationship with the.
BULL30|Are we to China with Asia so it's all good news for all those IT companies and all the American businesses.
NEUT31|They've got businesses or relationship with in China or in Asia.
NEUT32|So it's all good news.
NEUT33|And I think for those companies and I think yes, that this one for long term investment ideas for a long while for a short time just over there, because he can go a little bit get down there before going up again.
NEUT34|So that's all this is my understanding of this airport stock always just please guys.
NEUT35|Or ever look to the fundamental news and compare fundamental news with technical analysis.
NEUT36|Always there should be all of them on the same page.
NEUT37|"Thanks, bye."""
