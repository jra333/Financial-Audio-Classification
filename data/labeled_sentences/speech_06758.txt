NEUT0|"""In a runaway market, you will not get fancy dips."
NEUT1|So any sort of you know?
BEAR2|3040 point dip intraday qualifies as a dip.
NEUT3|And right now the timing is not very important till you have the direction right now how long this can continue.
NEUT4|It can't continue forever.
NEUT5|Sooner or later.
NEUT6|This sort of monster trend will end and we will move sideways.
NEUT7|But that point may not have been reached right now.
BEAR8|But what you can see is that day before you were up 60 points yesterday you were up 40 points, so slowly the amplitude is going down.
BULL9|So maybe the odds of a dip are increasing a little bit.
NEUT10|So that way you want to get in on any intraday 3040 point decline, which is a safer way of getting into the market.
NEUT11|But given the kind of rotation we see one days reliance another rates HDFC.
NEUT12|Bank so the market is getting held up by large stocks and that's how you know bull market proceeds with the sectoral churn.
NEUT13|So the idea is to still buy an maybe 12303 fifty.
NEUT14|Could be the next target and we could get there by the expiry.
BULL15|The monthly expiring autos have had a strong rally yesterday and a lot of them are coming off of.
NEUT16|Basis so I share is a buy with a stop of 22,000 target of 23200 escorts isabi with the stop of 622 target of 640 Bharti Airtel is a buy with a stop of 445 target of 470 GSPL is continuing its rally so that survive the stopper.
NEUT17|150 target of 162 and 1/3 feeds.
NEUT18|It keeps figuring in the list.
NEUT19|These are the few mid caps which are.
NEUT20|Doing well, so that's a buy with this top of 570 and look for targets about 6:05.
NEUT21|I'm slightly worried about the bank nifty not participating, but then I think the rest of the patterns picked up specially struggling last six extra, but on the nifty have maintained targets of 12,300 that's on the hourly chart.
NEUT22|When you connect all the recent highs, I think the rising trend comes around those levels, so that is an area where I would definitely look to take some profits off the table on the long positions on the index.
NEUT23|Otherwise, just hold on with your device.
NEUT24|Office close to what?
NEUT25|Well?
NEUT26|150 just below it.
NEUT27|I think getting past well 150 was a important to prevent being crossed, so that becomes a sport area.
NEUT28|But since we're far away from that, the idea should be that are under 3040 points in the upset should invite some profit booking and then wait for a dip to buy into fresh.
NEUT29|Otherwise hold onto your balance quantity and keep telling you stop causes.
NEUT30|Eventually I'm looking at 12,600 but in the short term 12,300 and I have three bites to sell on the wine side.
NEUT31|Hero Motors I think is reversing from.
NEUT32|I don't know what's wrong situation, so keep it up by 2034.
NEUT33|Look for 2430 as the target, but damn Puccini that survived the stop at 172 for targets of 184.
NEUT34|Also binds emails with the staff at 1503 for targets of 1575 and the solar cell call is an anti finance where the hourly charts have turned negative so keep a stop at 118.
BEAR35|"Look for declines to what levels of 109?"""
