BEAR0|"""You're live on the Goldman trade Pro Traders bought the reversal doji up had stopped markets protected profits."
NEUT1|There's another turn right there.
NEUT2|10 minute and the PV holding it down.
NEUT3|Bids are at one 7510 pennies.
BEAR4|Looks like Amazon had a reversal doji.
BEAR5|Had also looks like the contracts that I had at 12:20 I put out at 11:50 and we're gonna bottom out down an yeah and we got bids below there and we gotta turn on gold men.
NEUT6|Gold lens trying to turn.
NEUT7|We said 10 pennies as part of the consolidation and the longer that we can consolidate and that 10 minute.
NEUT8|Moving average can flatten out and the bar can get above it.
NEUT9|We'd have a robust breakout were not quite there, but I can tell you that the limit orders we were just at 35 pennies, we gotta tenpenny order and that's in that consolidation and the stock market's going to be 70.
NEUT10|8 pennies, which is about two teenies and the thing about it is it's mastering the risk.
NEUT11|It's mastering that consolidation.
NEUT12|Sooner or later, we're going to have to do it alright.
BEAR13|We got one trader hit at 10 pennies.
NEUT14|Now put the stock market in.
BEAR15|Stock Market is a swing low 1 penny below it.
NEUT16|You got to put my stock market at 28 pennies.
NEUT17|And.
NEUT18|And let's go through it that 10 minute.
NEUT19|Let me watch the indicator minus 68 CCI, 16.7% Diaz minus three on a Mac guy and just remember you gotta keep the stop.
NEUT20|You got to keep it.
NEUT21|Let's see if we can bounce.
NEUT22|That's that this we came out of that consolidation.
NEUT23|Now that's just a double bottom that bar there's that bar.
BULL24|Let's say we can bounce up up here.
NEUT25|Let's see, we can bounce like a trampoline up up here.
NEUT26|And let's see what are 15.15 -- 74, so keep your seatbelts on as long as that stop market orders there.
NEUT27|That's what we want and that's what we have the way we want.
NEUT28|Let people know here on that video that we said 11:50 and we dropped it down to 1028 and we'll see if we can hold the 11:52 that penny at one time we were 13.
NEUT29|Katie and I took it down to 12:20.
NEUT30|Then I took it down to 11:50 an we had 1158 at Penney.
BEAR31|Now we've taken it down to 1020 on the bid on the option and the thing about it is it's all about the haircut.
NEUT32|The retail investor happens to be what?
NEUT33|Experiencing and basically we will experience our wholesale entry as we always do.
NEUT34|Save penny penny.
NEUT35|Here it is.
BEAR36|1150 pennies 1170 by 12 and we've undercut that bid.
BEAR37|We've undercut the bid to 1020 bed.
NEUT38|I've told all SMF Pro traders thought that 1020 bed now back to the Goldman trade we got hit.
NEUT39|And we got that double bottom.
NEUT40|We need this to be a reversal doji.
NEUT41|"Somehow we need a follow up by."""
