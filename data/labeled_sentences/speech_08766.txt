NEUT0|"""Hey, its claim this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Well, I wasn't really planning on doing this one today because of, you know what I talked about in the video from Wednesday.
NEUT4|Well in regards to this big old pattern here, but the pattern just flexed its muscles here and shows that it really does matter.
NEUT5|And the pattern point or I should say the portion of the pattern specifically is the resistance portion, which is what I talked about previously.
NEUT6|Is that red line and what do I mean by just flexing its muscles?
NEUT7|Well this morning it was looking like the price was making a decision that looks it was looking like the Bulls were going to show up in a big way.
BEAR8|Price actually gapped up.
NEUT9|Up above and opened up above the red line.
NEUT10|The problem is that in that very same opening, 30 minutes.
NEUT11|It's like the Bears grabbed a magnet and then **** the price right back below that red line, and then you can see actually let me just zoom in here so you can see a little bit better.
NEUT12|There we go so real quick again.
NEUT13|Like I said, gapped up did not last long back below the red line it went so give credit credits to the Bulls.
NEUT14|Did try to fight back with.
NEUT15|Check it out.
NEUT16|You just can't make this stuff up right there bounce literally right off that red line as it's done previously.
NEUT17|So once again that red line has been.
NEUT18|You know, confirmed as a very stubborn level and that there is going to be any sort of, you know, bigger bullishness to come.
BULL19|Then like I said, just got that much more confirmation today that that resistance trendline is definitely going to level that you know, the price will not only need to break above, but the key there being staying above.
NEUT20|Because right here, yeah, the price broke above it on the gap up, but when they came to the second part of actually being able to stay up above it, well, that's where the price failed miserably and then was never able to get back up above it.
NEUT21|So that remains a key level to watch moving forward as far as supports are concerned.
NEUT22|The good news here is, you know the price, isn't it?
NEUT23|Anywhere close to the you know the bottom portion of this overall pattern down around the one 12:50 ish mark, so keep it on that if you care about more of a shorter term area of support.
NEUT24|Then what was revealed after today?
NEUT25|Very clearly that level right around one 1425, so keep an eye on that.
BULL26|But overall, yeah, definitely that red line going to be very very stubborn.
NEUT27|But let's see if the price can get the break above it moving forward.
NEUT28|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird.
NEUT33|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT34|But in a cruel way.
BEAR35|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT36|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT38|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
