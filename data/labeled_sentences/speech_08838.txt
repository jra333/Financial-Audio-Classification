NEUT0|"""The key question then Rebecca, do we know if the bond deal is actually going to go ahead?"
NEUT1|So the deal is you say it was meant for his earlier this week.
NEUT2|But yeah, shortly after reported that potential US band a lot of discussion prompt around the uncertainty of Jack Ma.
BEAR3|And we know that actually essentially the trailer sort of fallen quiet.
NEUT4|So far we know that perspective buyers haven't yet received information about the deal or perspectives of the deal, which is what we usually expect.
NEUT5|Do we have any indication then?
NEUT6|Rebecca whether you know the absence of Jack Ma has had any impact on confidence?
BEAR7|I mean, certainly speculation about menswear whereabouts as moderates have been increasing, particularly since since they decided to come with this potential bond deal.
BEAR8|And there are some investors saying that there are too many unknowns.
NEUT9|Given that you know Jack MA hasn't been seen and the kind of uncertainty around actions of Chinese regulators.
NEUT10|But it's you know it's important to note this is also a pretty popular company amount.
NEUT11|Bond holders, particularly US buyers, and of course as another analyst, point out to meet, you know, everything has a price.
NEUT12|If Bubba comes with a premium.
BULL13|It potentially can find a strong strong demand.
NEUT14|And if it does postpone this deal, does it really matter?
NEUT15|Does it need to sell debt and raise money at this point?
NEUT16|I know it's a great question.
BULL17|I think ultimately Alibaba is sitting on a really significant Poly cash and it has a very, very robust credit profile so well.
NEUT18|It has a sort of hefty maturity is about 1.5 million due this year.
NEUT19|It doesn't have an urgent need to come right now.
NEUT20|I think though the deal does carry some kind of symbolic important, particularly to investors.
NEUT21|Given the sort of trickiness that the group is facing right now to come to market with a really hefty deal to prove, that can.
BULL22|It can win over US investors.
BULL23|And to reaffirm this really important funding Channel 4 for the company.
NEUT24|"I think all of that carries carries a lot of weight as well."""
