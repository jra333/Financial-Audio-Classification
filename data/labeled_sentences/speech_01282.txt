NEUT0|"""Welcome to trade ideas."
NEUT1|I'm Jake Merle sitting down with John Jannarone, editor in chief of IPO Edge, John.
BULL2|Great to be back on the show.
BULL3|Thanks Jake.
NEUT4|So today we actually have to review on Thunder Bridge.
BULL5|You crushed it man, you were actually up to 100% over the past few months on this stock.
NEUT6|Can you please walk us through exactly what you were looking at and how things have unfolded over these past few months?
NEUT7|Yeah sure Jake.
NEUT8|So what happened with Thunder Bridge which is now repay?
NEUT9|Because these SPAC deal closed is the warrants looked really cheap?
NEUT10|They just weren't getting very much attention so I saw an opportunity there to get exposure to the warrants.
NEUT11|Which is risky, right?
BEAR12|Because of the deal hasn't closed, they would be worthless.
NEUT13|But since then the deal has closed and what happened was really interesting.
NEUT14|Baron Capital, Big Long Only fund came in.
NEUT15|They do a lot of small cap stocks, but they have a lot of capital that they're managing.
NEUT16|They came in and they said, you know what?
NEUT17|Why don't we?
NEUT18|Why don't we invest alongside the rest of the investors?
NEUT19|But let's get rid of all this solution for the warrants.
NEUT20|So what happened is the warrants got taken out for $1.50 in cash plus 1/4 of a warrant.
NEUT21|So what I said last time I was on I was on here with you.
NEUT22|I was to hang in there and it worked out.
NEUT23|So the stock is now trading and the warrants are also trading as well.
NEUT24|And it looks like you know they're worth roughly if you count the dollar $52.40 a share.
BEAR25|And so you originally recommended buying the warrants below $0.80 in April, you then doubled down at 165 or so in May and now they're trading like you said above, 240.
NEUT26|So given the recent price action and everything we've seen it, would you be buying it here at current levels?
NEUT27|Or would you just be taking profits?
NEUT28|You know, I think in the beginning I really believe that the business the common stock is worth $15 a share.
NEUT29|So I still like it.
BEAR30|I don't like it as much as I did before.
BEAR31|But yeah, you might take a little profit here, but you know, remember after the warrant announcement came out the stock, you know that the warrant dipped a little bit, and that's when I said to get back in because it just looked too cheap.
NEUT32|I mean, it was worth $1.50 in cash alone.
BEAR33|And I saw it dipping below $1.60.
NEUT34|And that's when I came on last time and said you should get in it.
NEUT35|You should get into it here.
NEUT36|So if you see people taking profit, which is, I believe, what happened last time.
NEUT37|There could be another chance to you know, jump along for the ride and over what time rising.
NEUT38|Do you think it will reach that $15 per share?
NEUT39|I'd say the next two years or so.
NEUT40|You know this is not, I mean, the company is a steady grower, but you know this is not something that's going to trade like some of these crazy IPO's that we've seen like Beyond meat or anything like that.
NEUT41|Well, John, we'll see how it plays out in the months to come.
BULL42|Thanks so much for joining us.
BULL43|Thanks a lot.
BEAR44|So John is still bullish on repay.
NEUT45|Specifically, he likes buying ticker symbol RP AY at current levels.
NEUT46|"With the target price of 15 over the next two years, that was John Jannarone of IPO Edge and for Real Vision I'm Jake Merl."""
