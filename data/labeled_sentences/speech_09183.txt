NEUT0|"""What do you make of this?"
NEUT1|Rebound in crypto is it is there sort of?
NEUT2|Is there a reason for it?
NEUT3|Like what's the story?
NEUT4|So I think the crypto market is just very cyclic.
NEUT5|I've been in it for more than five years and this is like the third or fourth time is basically done the same thing but at a different scale, right?
NEUT6|So it goes up to its all time high crashes down takes a longer time to kind of like bounce back, and if you've been in crypto long enough you're pretty much expecting it.
NEUT7|But what about those who talked of being lured into crypto because this time it's different.
NEUT8|This time its institutional players that are backing it.
NEUT9|This time it's.
NEUT10|Adela T saying that they're going to be opening some sort of means of trading and also a safe place to be able to store your money in your cash, is it changing, and is it getting more institutional?
BULL11|I think there is progress on the protocol side.
NEUT12|There are lots of like high quality engineers and developers who are now building in the space that weren't.
NEUT13|Let's say two years ago and the other reasons of like institutional investors moving in.
BEAR14|I'm always personally a little bit sceptical of that.
NEUT15|I think in general this technology so knew no one really knows, like what.
NEUT16|What really is happening?
NEUT17|What we do know is that the market itself is maturing and it is.
NEUT18|There are some more sophisticated players that are entering the market.
NEUT19|I can't.
NEUT20|I don't think it has anything to do with really institution players moving in when we talk about sort of what we're seeing with Facebook, I know what they're doing isn't quite a cryptocurrency.
NEUT21|Depending on who you ask, but does that sort of at least open up?
NEUT22|I guess the door to I guess a more individual I guess.
NEUT23|Which type of sort of network?
NEUT24|Something that's a little bit different.
NEUT25|And we're having with these various blockchains, but something where people have more control over their individual assets.
NEUT26|Absolutely, I think there are a couple of angles to what Facebook has done.
NEUT27|First of all, I think the analogy there would be that what they're building is something like AOL, not really like well, because there was a single company that was trying to build similar things to the open Internet.
NEUT28|What Facebook has done is that they have a bunch of other companies in it, right?
NEUT29|So it's almost like a Federation, but it looks more like AOL than the open Internet.
NEUT30|"And in terms of the positive effects, it can have on crypto is that it could be the onramp through which people discover what crypto looks like so you're."""
