BULL0|"""Good morning investors and traders."
NEUT1|This is a Muslim chief market analyst at our trade and welcome to our daily update on our YouTube channel.
NEUT2|If you haven't subscribed to our channel, highly recommend you to do so because this gives you an opportunity to ask us questions while we are live in this particular session.
NEUT3|Now it as always, we discussed several different markets covering crypto, commodities, forex and of course equity market.
NEUT4|Why don't we begin the conversation by looking at the equity market.
BEAR5|Yesterday we saw record.
BULL6|I will be so really decent gains for the NASDAQ.
BULL7|In fact, the daily gain with the biggest ones since November last year.
NEUT8|So nearly four months and of course they Dow Jones and S&P 500 indices.
BULL9|Both of them have continued their upward journey remembered day before yesterday.
BULL10|The Dow Jones industrial Average Reilly posted its new all time high where the NASDAQ is still quite far because of the massive tech sell off that we've seen during the past for a few days.
NEUT11|So let's continue to monitor that.
NEUT12|In terms of our economic data at 1:30 PM, we are going to get the US CPI numbers.
BEAR13|The numbers are really likely to resurface.
NEUT14|Some of that inflation concern for those those concerns those quants which really made the market that panicky feeling and then really created that massive concern among investors and traders who started to sell tech sell off because of increasing bond yields and increasing the inflation concerns that the Federal Reserve.
NEUT15|Maybe increasing its interest rate much sooner than anticipated, but if we look at the global landscape of these, I have monetary policy.
NEUT16|We had the RBA coming out his decision on his monetary policy and the stance was very saying it defended its decision that there is no need to increase interest rate despite any inflation or bond.
NEUT17|You concerned the bank is in no rush to do that.
NEUT18|Later on today we have the Bank of Canada also coming up with his decision as well and it is very much likely to be the same as well.
NEUT19|At least that is what market is anticipating.
NEUT20|You may want to keep an eye on cat Dollar because that is likely to move and the decision will come.
NEUT21|And of course at 1530 we are going to get the crude inventory data.
BULL22|The expectation is that we will get higher number in terms of approved inven trees and that can bring more sell off for Brenton Oil, which are already and a considerable amount of sell off.
BULL23|After posting those massive gains which happened because OPEC left his production cut unchanged.
BULL24|Remember, Brent prices went well above $71.00 and their peers the upper level of Bollinger Band.
NEUT25|But now they have retraced back to the other, retracing back toward the 20 day simple moving average.
NEUT26|Now in terms of a NASDAQ, we have done a video earlier today discussing that several different price.
NEUT27|Our walls, whether prices ready bounce or what.
NEUT28|We said yesterday on our YouTube channel and where the prices are really going to go so highly recommend you to have a look of all of those price levels.
NEUT29|And of course, as always, if you like the content.
NEUT30|Food.
BULL31|Forget to like the video because it really helped us on our YouTube channel as well.
NEUT32|That's all for now and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
NEUT33|"Same place, same time."""
