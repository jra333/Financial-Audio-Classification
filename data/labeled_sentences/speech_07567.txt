BULL0|"""Body I thanks for joining and watching this quick video."
NEUT1|An update on Walmart supermarket stock.
NEUT2|This is one of the biggest chain in in the US and it is well known worldwide.
NEUT3|If you don't know a lot about Walmart, just please Google it, go on the major financial websites and get this man information as you can as it is usual for all the stocks that you would like to invest into it.
NEUT4|So before investing it's better to have a better understanding of the company that we are investing.
NEUT5|In so I found some fundamental analysis that will support our technical analysis that is in front of us in front of us.
NEUT6|There is one hour candle stick chart.
NEUT7|This is an uptrend major trend is the blue line minor trained, say or secondary?
NEUT8|Trend is the red line that is moving around the blue line.
NEUT9|So zigzagging around the blue line and the brand is always the majority and the voter voter base on taking analysis is some fundamental analysis.
NEUT10|It seems that the process is ready.
BULL11|To move up, perhaps not like I did.
NEUT12|Straight forward up to this target price.
NEUT13|Perhaps always zigzagging's always up and downs, but it seems now that it's good time to buy before buying.
NEUT14|Just let's see if this.
NEUT15|Let's see if the one one point 251.26 U.S. dollar share price will be broken if we will be broken, perhaps he means it means that the market can really go up.
NEUT16|White has to be broken because you worked.
NEUT17|Is resistance for this peak that for this one so it so it can be seen as resistance level?
BULL18|So, but if this residence level would be broken, it's a good signal that the market will keep going down.
NEUT19|So wait a little bit before buying.
NEUT20|Even that, I think the Mac D and the stochastic shows both of them signal.
NEUT21|So buying right now.
NEUT22|But I would wait just a couple of hours.
BULL23|So perhaps one day to see Freda's market will keep moving up.
NEUT24|And the good news actually is just tomorrow morning.
NEUT25|So back actually ideas to invest before tomorrow because tomorrow there will.
BULL26|There will be hopefully good news for the for the.
BULL27|Ending reportes that will be shipped tomorrow morning before the market session in the US Times around lunchtime in UK in Europe soon let's say so and analysts are looking for one point 117 shares earning per share.
BULL28|So it's it's good results in this considering that we are in a crisis virus situation.
NEUT29|So again the based on technical analysis where there is an uptrend.
NEUT30|This is the trend line that perhaps it might be the finest and run even if there are just 2123.
NEUT31|Three points as as we as per my Lesson plan.
NEUT32|The lines we need to have at least three points 224 meter in the line, but those are just general rules.
NEUT33|They can Barry for sure, but these are the main general rules on trend lines and and let's see what's gonna happen next, so the prices might go up or based on the bullish market.
NEUT34|And based on the fact that we would like to invest always in the trend direction.
NEUT35|So always going upward.
NEUT36|This idea to invest to go long is supported by fundamental analysis as well.
NEUT37|So those are my information on Walmart, so this is the price movement in front of us.
BULL38|It seems that the prices are gonna move upward and fundamental fundamental analysis will support it.
NEUT39|Just wait the if you want to be more confidence before buying.
NEUT40|Just wait today the this this level 1256 or most is going to be broken before buying.
NEUT41|"Thanks bye."""
