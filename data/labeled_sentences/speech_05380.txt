BULL0|"""David it is good to see you and the one thing I keep hearing."
NEUT1|People say, and understandably is that the Fed is out of bullets here are they or aren't they?
NEUT2|I would say there almost out of bullets.
NEUT3|Remember there were a couple of things they did during the crisis that they have not yet done one of something called the term asset lending facility or TALF an what that was was they took asset backed securities that were used to basically back consumer loans.
NEUT4|That's something they could do.
NEUT5|Again they'll probably need some more capital from the Treasury to do that.
NEUT6|And of course they haven't put capital into the banks, but the banks don't appear to need it and they don't have any money for that.
NEUT7|So I would say there are.
NEUT8|Almost out of bullets, it's why it's so important and so useful that the White House and the Congress were talking about a big fiscal stimulus, right?
NEUT9|And Shrikumar just made an interesting point.
NEUT10|I don't know if you caught it, but he said he liked all the liquidity measures the Fed was taking, but thought it would have been better if they left rates up at 1:00 or 2% for the sake of the borrowers who depend on that kind of income.
NEUT11|Low income, he said.
NEUT12|You know some of the older populations is there.
NEUT13|Could there be a case for that look?
NEUT14|It's always true that there are winners and losers when the Fed cuts interest rates.
NEUT15|That's not unique to the crisis.
BEAR16|It's bad for savers, good for good for borrowers.
NEUT17|I don't think it makes any sense though.
NEUT18|At this time the Fed is the first responder.
NEUT19|They had to do everything they could.
NEUT20|The benefits of cutting rates to borrowers.
NEUT21|People have adjustable rate loans and stuff like that seemed to be far exceed the cost.
NEUT22|Plus, I think it was despite the market's immediate reaction, a real confidence boost that the Fed was on top of things.
NEUT23|And I think also when the Fed the Fed knows.
NEUT24|And when rates are so close to zero, it's important to move big and move soon rather than to wait.
BEAR25|So I disagree with Sreekumar well into your point about them being the first responder.
NEUT26|Something that I wonder is once you have the fiscal piece of this coming into place, which may include direct checks, and I mean the host of other measures we've heard today with the feds start to unwind.
NEUT27|Some of this 'cause this is very different downturn from the Great Recession when it was followed by a long period of financial repression, so to speak.
NEUT28|If we have a sharp.
NEUT29|Downturn and a sharp recovery that could be a challenge for them as well to unwind some of this right.
NEUT30|I think we should be so lucky that that's the problem.
NEUT31|Yeah, I mean it's very easy to turn off these facilities like the Commercial Paper funding facility and they pretty much said they're not going to raise rates for a long time until the economy is healthy again.
BULL32|I think that the risks of moving to prematurely to cut off support will exceed the benefits, and I expect him to be very patient.
NEUT33|You know?
NEUT34|Yeah, if we're really lucky and this thing is shorter than we expect.
BEAR35|And inflation goes above their target.
NEUT36|Well, that's an easy problem to deal with.
NEUT37|I'm not not the one I'm worrying about right now.
NEUT38|"Yeah, absolutely."""
