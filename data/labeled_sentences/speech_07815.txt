NEUT0|"""Hello, this is Alan Kendall and this is Warren Buffett's value formula."
NEUT1|Warren wants the most value for the least price, so you divide the value by the price and you get a value to price ratio.
NEUT2|What Warren considers value are the net earnings plus the dividend.
NEUT3|The net earnings he calls retained earnings, its money that's retained by the company at the end of the year, and that money is used to grow the company and Warren relies very heavily that accompanied with high net earnings that the company will grow overtime and the stock will grow with it and the dividends can be used to purchase more shares or to grow your portfolio with other stocks.
NEUT4|The prices that he uses is the price to book, which is a ratio of how much you pay for its assets.
NEUT5|Let's look at a few companies ConocoPhillips, which warn is it has purchased recently, has a seven and a half percent net profit about a 4% dividend and the price to book is less than one which is .79.
BULL6|So it comes out with a whopping score of 14.4.
NEUT7|When you do the raision.
NEUT8|When you do the when you do the math this is higher than 10 so Warren is buying the company because it has high returns for a little price.
NEUT9|Exxon Mobil has a high high net profit, high dividend, but the price to book is high.
NEUT10|It shows that a high quality company sells for a premium, and so the average is only the ratio is only average at 3.7.
NEUT11|So Warren is buying ConocoPhillips because it has more value for less price.
NEUT12|Let's look at some other companies.
NEUT13|Energy energy that Warren is buying is a 16%.
NEUT14|Net profit doesn't pay a dividend, and the price to book is less than one.
BULL15|So this 16% net profit will is high and the price is low, so it comes out with a whopping 18.1.
BULL16|Warren is buying NRG Energy because of this high ratio Disney has a good good net with 10% a high.
BULL17|A good dividend of 1 1/2% and the price to book is.
NEUT18|Is actually very low, only 28 percent, 1.2 eight, 20% more than the than the assets are you paying for for the stock, and so the ratio is reflected.
NEUT19|It comes out very close to 10, but because you have these other companies like energy, energy that have lower prices and higher returns, Warren is buying them and not Disney at this time.
NEUT20|Another stock that Warren is owned in the past is McDonald's with a 19% net profit.
NEUT21|A 3 1/2 percent dividend, but the price to book is.
NEUT22|You're paying a premium.
NEUT23|It's it's close to five, and so this is reflected in the score of 4.5 and Warren would wait for a dip into McDonald's before he would buy into it.
NEUT24|He wouldn't buy it at this.
NEUT25|At this ratio.
BEAR26|Scores that are under 2 the stock will fall.
NEUT27|We saw General Motors and Ford when they went under to their.
BEAR28|Their stocks really came down, and eventually the earnings went negative and the ratios went negative.
NEUT29|That was right.
NEUT30|Bad scores between 2:00 and 10:00 or average Warren is all for the sure thing he will wait.
NEUT31|Years and even decades for a price to fall so that it will so that it won't be average so that he will be paying so that the company will be undervalued.
BULL32|An scores over 10 the stock should rise to reflect the high earnings and the low price and more and relies very heavily on retained earnings.
NEUT33|Growing the companies over time.
NEUT34|This has been Alan Kendall.
NEUT35|Have a nice day.
NEUT36|"Bye bye."""
