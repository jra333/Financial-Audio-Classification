BULL0|"""Welcome back everybody."
NEUT1|Couple of reasons why X LM is going to blow off today.
NEUT2|First of all, you can see a bull flag here.
BEAR3|An extra limb on a daily chart both like it already broke out to the upside.

BEAR6|We closed a very bullish candle all the way up to 192 K. This is very bullish, very bullish.
NEUT7|Let's have a look on the retracement here on the FIB level.
BULL8|On the dollar, yeah, we came back all the way to the 618 Golden pocket.
BULL9|Very bullish retrace and we're now bouncing from it on uptick in volume.
BULL10|Again, see volume is rising here above average very good.
NEUT11|Looks like XLM is going to make another huge move like that, and the targets basically for the next move.
NEUT12|Guys, it's probably going to go all the way to 29029 or maybe even 039. Who knows?
