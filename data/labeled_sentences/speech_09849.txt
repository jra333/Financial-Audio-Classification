NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Report will back another video today.
NEUT2|Today I will be talking about UW MC stock, previously known as GHIV stock and as you guys know, UW MC is a mortgage company and there's a number one in the US, so I'm holding this stock long term no matter where it goes.
BULL3|I think in the longer term this stock will do very well, OK?
BULL4|They did put them isn't dividends on the stock to $0.10 a share, which is also good.
NEUT5|So I am holding this stock long term.
BEAR6|The stock did have this drop down and it dropped again.
NEUT7|So all this shows me is that I'm going to probably get more shares.
NEUT8|I'll wait till Monday to see how it opens, but as you guys know I put this resistance.
NEUT9|I said watch this low as it was coming up and look at the resistance.
NEUT10|Just had it perfect came down in the hard drop right?
NEUT11|So like I said this resistance was at 11.4 like.
NEUT12|You always got you guys always want to put the levels that I give you 'cause he's a very key level is OK. Just look at that right.
NEUT13|Had to run up.
BEAR14|Came right to the level and then drop.
NEUT15|So now I'm looking to get more shares to hold longer term, no matter how low it goes.
NEUT16|I'll just keep buying shares.
NEUT17|Like I said, I am longer term bullish on this company, so this is just a quick update.
BEAR18|I do want to get shares below $10 around the nine area and I'll just start averaging in shares as it's going lower and I want to start going higher.
NEUT19|I'll just be holding OK. You just have to wait for them to keep producing the revenue, their profits, how the companies move in.
BULL20|And trust me, the stock will go up OK.
NEUT21|So make sure you guys hold, hold, hold like I am holding and this is it for the video known as the recommendation of our.
NEUT22|"So anything is educational purposes only, so do not try anything to see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
