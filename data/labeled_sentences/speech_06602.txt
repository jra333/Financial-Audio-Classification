NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to these technical analysis video here at xm.com."
NEUT1|Please choose the September 17th and today will be looking at the pound versus the US dollar.
BEAR2|So assuming into the daily chart we can see that the pair stretched as high as 1.25 after breaking above these downward sloping channel and while the RSI is back in this week's weakness in the market, this seems not very convincing that this negative momentum could persist given that the indicator is still above its 50 neutral mark and the 10 constant line.
BULL3|Over here continues to move with a steep positive slope above the Blue King Johnson.
BULL4|Besides that, if we look at the shorter term moving averages, the 20 day moving average is preparing to cross above the 50 day in May, providing some hopes that these are rebound may remain in place in the short term, not to get more convinced that negative momentum is something more than temporary.
NEUT5|We may need to see the price crossing under 1.22 and the bottom of the McLeod.
NEUT6|If this is the case, support could be next found somewhere between one point 2067.
BEAR7|And the multi year low of one point 1957 which is lower than the post Brexit referendum low of one point 1986.
NEUT8|If this area fails to hold then we could look at 119 and one point 18 psychological levels.
BULL9|On the flip side, now with the market gets through 1.25 and more importantly higher than one point, 2578 fifty percent hibachi over the Dominic from one point 3380 to one point 1957 could provide immediate resistance.
NEUT10|This is around 1.26 or 68 upper.
BULL11|There at one point, 2782 has been quite restrictive to upside than downside corrections in the past and therefore will be closely watch for sharper upward moves once we surpass the 200 day moving average.
BULL12|If we successfully close above one 2782 other, the medium term picture would also shift from bearish to neutral.
NEUT13|So that's it from me.
NEUT14|Thank you for watching.
BULL15|"Have a great day."""
