BEAR0|"""Hey guys, quick video on Neo you could see after hours it drops a lot."
NEUT1|That's primarily because they had an offering just like what Tesla did the other day.
NEUT2|Just like with the expected the other day as well.
NEUT3|A few days ago nothing new IT happens a lot of the times we want to raise some capital, specially when they think their stock price is a little bit higher and they can dig in with standard drop for a little bit after hours.
BULL4|It did come back down to support.
BEAR5|Now this is a support with the Magdi below 0.
NEUT6|So we have to be careful we have to make sure it doesn't drop too much.
NEUT7|The next level of support is right at 40 bucks.
NEUT8|When we look at the daily chart you can see.
NEUT9|Right move down and this is the rejection and you know what happens when we hit the pattern of the rejection pattern or come back down to support.
NEUT10|If this is still above 0, it may be saved and this is what we'll see the turn around.
NEUT11|And this is we will either buy some leap options calls or some put up put spreads and having it bounce off of there going back to 5060 seventy down the line.
NEUT12|So be on the lookout for this one.
NEUT13|It's gonna be really quick trade but will be most likely next week so be ready.
NEUT14|Have some capital in hand.
BULL15|We're going to make some money happen.
NEUT16|"Just a couple of days, bye."""
