BULL0|"""Hey good morning everyone."
BULL1|Welcome to the video on July 6, 2020 the market as we have mentioned yesterday, when the futures market open is rallying in a big way, technology has gone up substantially.
NEUT2|Selected stocks such as Amazon Square, Tesla are going up in in an immense amount, so where?
NEUT3|Our opportunities are there still anything left to buy?
NEUT4|You know, are we going to join this irrational exuberance or we're just going to stay on the sideline?
NEUT5|I think there are a lot of arguments on that one, but let's just pinpoint on a couple of stocks that I think has a little bit more upside to go.
NEUT6|This one, Huber.
BULL7|It had news last night that they were buying post mate and the stock has gone up 7% since the news released and I I see that there might.
BULL8|Still be some opportunity for the buy side on this particular ticker.
NEUT9|So let's take a look at this for our chart.
BULL10|I think the bullish argument can be made for the fact that it has for the first time in a number of days that it has busted through the 200 day moving average.
NEUT11|Also is also on top of the eight day and 21 day moving average as well.
BULL12|So that is definitely a bullish sign.
NEUT13|And taking a look.
NEUT14|With the Fibonacci retracement.
NEUT15|So we draw from the low to high against the low right here.
NEUT16|We see that 3540 or 3973 could be our next target for the upside.
NEUT17|So for me, based on this particular.
NEUT18|Technical analysis, I would place a tray right here with my stopped around $31 to chase the upside of 3540 or 3973 with earnings coming up within a month.
NEUT19|I think people might be buying into this particular stock to to chase the earnings play, so that might be 1 stock that everyone can take a look at.
NEUT20|If one doesn't want to chase the Amazon and the Tesla of the world, so thank you so much.
