NEUT0|"""Berkshire Hathaway recently announced that it made a big purchase into Verizon stock, and now I'm looking at following suit, because really, we know that Warren Buffett is a long term investor."
NEUT1|Of course, I'm going to do my own due diligence and make sure Verizon is a good company, but ultimately what it comes down to is Warren Buffett has is a much better analyst of businesses, at least for the long term.
NEUT2|So I'm going to ride his coattail here.
NEUT3|Hopefully soon, I'm going to buy shares.
NEUT4|Maybe tomorrow, maybe in the next week, maybe two weeks.
NEUT5|Either way, when I do by all, go ahead and pin a comment, which let's you know what price I bought at Warren Buffett.
NEUT6|Based on his cost basis of roughly, I think, just over $8.6 billion.
NEUT7|And maybe 176 million shares.
NEUT8|Don't quote me, but I did the math earlier and it's roughly he got in at about $29.22 per share, since when the announcement happened, or the 13 F filing was revealed, there was maybe like a 4% pop in share price for Verizon.
NEUT9|But since it's come down with the broader market and now I can get in roughly at a 7% discount as to what Berkshire Hathaway bought at.
NEUT10|Now, of course, this isn't a foolproof plan.
NEUT11|Warren Buffett isn't impervious to bad investments.
NEUT12|He's made many of them over the years, but on average you can see through his track record.
NEUT13|He has made a lot of really good investments.
NEUT14|So this 13 F filing all institutional managers are required to file them quarterly.
NEUT15|But Warren Buffett or via Berkshire Hathaway is a very specific case.
NEUT16|Most institutional fund managers we can't really.
NEUT17|Lean too much into the positions that they're taking because a lot of them have shorter timeframes, or they might be hedging certain positions.
NEUT18|But with Warren Buffett, of course we know that his favorite holding period is forever, so I also have a long time time horizon as well, so it's a very strong vote of confidence in Verizon.
BULL19|And also Verizon has a nice dividend today.
BULL20|I think it's just above 4.5% around current price level.
BULL21|Hopefully price goes down slow down a little bit more before I buy and then my yield will be higher.
BEAR22|Sorry for the wind as well.
BULL23|I'm trying to multitask today overall.
NEUT24|Once again Verizon.
BULL25|I think it's going to be a great play as well.
NEUT26|I've done a lot of my own due diligence.
NEUT27|Of course, debt is pretty high for the company, but it's.
NEUT28|To be expected, an industry that it's in the dividend also seems pretty safe.
BULL29|There's a lot to like about the company, and I mean once again it's gotten Warren Buffett stamp of approval, so I'll dive in as well.
NEUT30|I think I might pick up 100 or 200 shares an if and when I do I'll go ahead and put in a comment that lets you know my buy price.
NEUT31|This was just a quick update today.
NEUT32|Maybe I'll do a more thorough breakdown of what I like about Verizon specifically.
NEUT33|Likely some very similar things that.
NEUT34|Berkshire or Warren Buffett was looking at, but if you have any comments questions please, just go ahead and drop him in the comments.
NEUT35|And if you haven't checked out my recent video.
BULL36|"Check it out as always, thanks for stopping by."""
