NEUT0|"""For a rally joining me now with some pics is gave out the senior energy analyst at Cohen gave how do you pick?"
NEUT1|Tell the difference between these stocks.
BULL2|Yeah John, thanks for having me and you know, I think your point, your conversation with Dom.
NEUT3|I think you know there's.
NEUT4|There's definitely a lot of new exciting EV models that they hit the hit the market over the next couple of years.
NEUT5|And you know the one thing that had prohibited EV adoption or wider scale EV Dotson to this point is really charging infrastructure and we do think that that proliferates over the next 10 years at about it.
NEUT6|30% Kager we do see 20-30 likely you'll need about two to three million public connectors and then there's likely to be another 5,000,000 connectors deployed at home.
BULL7|So we do see overall significant growth ahead over the next decade in the market and between the two stocks.
BULL8|You're coming out positive on Chargepoint and Blink 2.
NEUT9|Two different business models.
NEUT10|We do like Chargepoint as our topic.
NEUT11|Really differentiated themselves up to this point as a market leader in the US with about 60 to 70% hardware share and the company does not monetize the driver, which essentially means they don't sell electricity to the driver as you as you know, kind of kind of using analogy to typical gas station selling gasoline to customers, refilling their traditional cars.
NEUT12|So OK, makes a hardware sale and then also attached to it.
BULL13|Is there software offering which provides some nice sticky revenue that comes in higher margin?
NEUT14|And so we do think the company like I said.
BULL15|Although it's a nascent sector thus far, they've done a really nice job of taking share and we do it.
NEUT16|I can do believe though, if you believe that a bunch of Teslas and maybe these Mustangs and other cars are going to sell, then shouldn't you want to play with somebody who is making money off of that customer sale?
NEUT17|Yeah, yeah John, that's a good point and so that's why we do like blink here.
BULL18|We think the company is attractively positioned to capitalize on increase in utilization on charging infrastructure.
NEUT19|You know, today I think most estimates put it or our estimates.
NEUT20|Put it around 5 to 10% utilization, which likely means one to two charging sessions per day.
BULL21|As the growing EV fleet continues.
BULL22|Utilization is like a spike higher and we do think blank is as well positioned and they do have significant operating leverage in the in the business model so.
NEUT23|So two different business models.
NEUT24|At this point, it's it's an early early sector as you mentioned.
NEUT25|You know it certainly remains to be seen which one will be best positioned but but we do like both those specific reasons.
NEUT26|How much of this is real estate connected or kind of like the cell tower business where you question how good are certain companies at knowing where to place these things?
NEUT27|An acquiring that location at a reasonable cost?
NEUT28|Yeah, yeah John, it's it's a great question.
NEUT29|You know, it's certainly a land and expand model, right?
NEUT30|So I think relationships with your site host your site partners comes into play.
NEUT31|A lot of these companies do a lot of deep dive work on where exactly put a charging station for some of the slower stations you'll see them proliferate in supermarkets.
NEUT32|You know Whole Foods, Walmart, Costco, and really the utilization on that is really about changing consumer behavior.
NEUT33|You're not necessarily going to fuel anymore, but recharging your car will ultimately become.
NEUT34|Part of your background of your day to day scenario.
NEUT35|Maybe you hit the gym.
NEUT36|You charge your car while you're at the gym.
NEUT37|OK, OK, well I can see that possibility.
NEUT38|Players like Costco you think still going to be important here like they are with gas quickly?
NEUT39|Yeah yeah.
NEUT40|Sure look Costco obviously part of their models offering cheap gasoline.
NEUT41|We think.
NEUT42|Ultimately they can offer cheap electricity at a particularly or extremely low price accounts for more foot traffic.
BULL43|That would be an interesting benefit with the membership.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
