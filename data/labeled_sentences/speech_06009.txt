NEUT0|"""Would you be better off putting your retirement account on autopilot?"
NEUT1|I'm Jack cartereditorbarrons.com with Andrew Berean, associate editor at the magazine.
NEUT2|Andrew, you wrote a cover story for Barons on these things called Target Date funds, which are taking over the 401K market.
NEUT3|First of all, can you just explain what they are?
NEUT4|Well, they're basically supposed to be one stop shopping for participants in 401K and other retirement plans there essentially diversified mix of stocks and bonds in a single mutual fund.
NEUT5|And the asset allocation of those funds shifts over time to become more conservative as you approach retirement.
NEUT6|So do you think this is a good idea?
NEUT7|Should people do it?
BULL8|Yeah, that's a pretty good idea for people.
NEUT9|I think many people try to do it.
NEUT10|Do it yourself and do their own investing and manage their own 401K plans or erase this basically pretty simple way to do it than most of many of the funds are pretty good now.
NEUT11|I've obviously one could argue as to what the ideal asset allocation is.
NEUT12|People have that battle all the time.
NEUT13|One of the things that I like about these funds though, is.
NEUT14|They they have a behavioral benefit which is, among other things, rather than you in a market crash.
NEUT15|Having to step up, sell bonds and buy stocks.
NEUT16|They do it for you, so they sort of psychologically.
NEUT17|It's a little bit easier just to put all your money in this thing and let somebody else do it.
NEUT18|Well, it's coming, David.
NEUT19|They do re allocate to stocks and bonds that maintain a pretty fixed ratio.
NEUT20|It should be said that there is a high allocation to equities for most of the life of these target funds.
NEUT21|So if you're in your 30s forties.
NEUT22|Or even into early 50s you might have 7580 as much as 90% of the investment in these funds in stocks.
NEUT23|So you're taking a good deal of equity risk right now.
BEAR24|Well, that was one criticism.
NEUT25|Even in 08, some people who are very close to retirement took a pretty big hit.
BEAR26|Not as big a hit as they would have been saying all in equities, but on the reverse side, you know, a lot of people were defaulting just into the money market fund.
NEUT27|They thought, well, it's safe.
NEUT28|I'm not going to lose money, and it's really a guaranteed way not to have enough money in retirement, right?
NEUT29|Specially with inflation right now?
NEUT30|If you're in money market fund or even a stable value fund, you're going to.
NEUT31|Not keep up with inflation or barely keep up with inflation.
NEUT32|This is off of your fighting chance to have a refund of money for retirement.
NEUT33|Now that said, are there any other downsides of these?
NEUT34|I think the equity allocation Vicki planning fees are relatively low and I think for many people who don't want to be bothered in terms of managing their 401K plans.
NEUT35|I mean, these funds essentially manage it for you, so it's a good option that's taking over.
NEUT36|The 41K market is much of half of all contributions are now going into these target date funds within five years.
NEUT37|It could be the predominant investment for most people in the 41K plans, even if you don't think they're perfect.
NEUT38|I would certainly say that there are far worse ways to invest your retirement than these.
BULL39|"That's true, thanks very much, Andrew."""
