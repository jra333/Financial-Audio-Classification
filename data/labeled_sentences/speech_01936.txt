BULL0|"""Welcome back to the 12 chance of Christmas today."
NEUT1|I'm going to take you through emerging markets and commodities.
BEAR2|As you can see from the chart, oil has had a terrible year in 2014, packed the biggest market story of the year.
NEUT3|But it's not just oil.
BEAR4|Commodities in general have done very badly.
NEUT5|It suggests first of all, that the long commodity supercycle, which sort of very strong rises in commodities for much of the last decade, is over.
BEAR6|It also suggests that there is a lack of demand out there in the world that the global economy is not as strong as many.
NEUT7|Would like to think now emerging markets are critically dependent on the commodity market.
BEAR8|This green line shows you how Imma see the MCI emerging markets indexes done compared to the S&P and you can see that as commodities fall so emerging markets relative performance tends to deteriorate.
NEUT9|Could we be getting to the point where we're ready for a turn here?
NEUT10|It's a very critical and very difficult question for the year to come.
NEUT11|As we enter it, people are starting to talk about what about $30 oil or about $20 oil.
BEAR12|Those kinds of levels would be good for a few emerging markets, but could lead to outright crises in others.
NEUT13|Also.
NEUT14|Obviously once people start talking so bearishly can often be a very good idea to bet against them, but ultimately this is the critical point for emerging markets.
NEUT15|What happens to commodities in 2015 next time?
NEUT16|"We'll take a look at by far the most important emerging markets, which is China."""
