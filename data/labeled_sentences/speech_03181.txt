BULL0|"""Well, stock prices have further to rise about this much further."
NEUT1|According to Felix Zulauf of Zulauf asset Management.
NEUT2|Here to speak with me today.
NEUT3|Hi Felix, I Jack, do you think the rally the bounce that we've seen in stock price is going to continue but not much longer?
BEAR4|And what's coming could be trouble for stock investors.
NEUT5|Can you explain?
BULL6|I think we are in a recovery rally in the early stages of a cyclical bear market around the world.
NEUT7|There may be a few indices like the S&P that may manage to minor new highs later this year or early very early next, but after that I think next year is going to be a cyclical bear market around the world, including the US.
NEUT8|How big of a decline might be might be talking.
BEAR9|Well, bear markets are usually 20% plus, so I would think that the SNP could decline back to about 1600.
NEUT10|You don't think we'll see the typical signs that we see from a bear market you were you were talking about?
NEUT11|No, we won't have the big rate hike, for example, that cools off the economy.
NEUT12|What will it look like?
NEUT13|This time around?
NEUT14|The normal pattern is you have a booming economy.
BEAR15|You have inflationary pressures rising.
NEUT16|You have rising interest rates and then tightening monetary policy by the central banks.
NEUT17|That is not happening this time because it's a deflationary cycle we are living in a global village so to speak.
NEUT18|Global trade is 60% of global GDP.
NEUT19|And it's very important what happens elsewhere.
BULL20|I think the biggest driving engine for the world economy in recent years, China is continuing to slow down and will eventually devalue its currency and that is going to affect all other currencies and therefore the US dollar will strengthen versus virtually all other currencies and it will hit profits when the biggest exporter of the world devalues its own currency by 10 to 20% which I expect over the next 12 months.
BEAR21|Then it hits global, globally traded good prices and therefore it means that sales for companies outside that area will go down.
BEAR22|It will affect profit margins and it will affect profits and so profits will come under pressure and it will erode economic growth.
NEUT23|So if we have a little bit further to go on the rally, what should stock investors hold to participate in this last bit of upside, and what should they hold to get ready for the downside?
NEUT24|Bonds?
NEUT25|Which of the leading stocks in this rally and then the whole bull market all the straw?
NEUT26|Longest ones and those are the e-commerce, Venus, the Amazons, the Facebooks, the Googles.
NEUT27|I also think you can hold a Microsoft, those who benefit from rising e-commerce.
NEUT28|You can also hold a few very domestic oriented stocks like Home Depot etc.
NEUT29|And for next year I think in a global bear market you want to be as defensive and this cautious as you can be.
NEUT30|And I think next year.
NEUT31|You can hold long term US treasures again.
BEAR32|We have now some upside pressure during these stock rally.
NEUT33|Maybe by 20 or 30 basis points for long bond yields.
BULL34|Going to maybe slightly above 3% an next year.
BEAR35|I think they will go down again so those yields don't look right now.
NEUT36|Don't worry bout it.
BEAR37|Lock him in while you can, because they're going to get worse.
NEUT38|That's right.
BULL39|OK, thanks Phyllis, for sharing your view, you're most welcome.
BULL40|"Thank you, Jack."""
