BULL0|"""Matt, we're going to wrap it up here real quick with one to watch earning season in Full Tilt here now."
NEUT1|And so there's gonna be plenty to choose from.
NEUT2|What is your one to watch for this coming week?
NEUT3|I am keeping my eye on Synchrony Financial.
NEUT4|They are one of the big issues of store credit cards and they are an online bank.
NEUT5|They report earnings on Friday and there's a couple of things I'm watching for number one.
BEAR6|They lost their.
BEAR7|They announced recently that they lost their partnership with Walmart which is a big deal.
NEUT8|This is like when American Express lost its cost.
NEUT9|Copartnership this is the big thing in the.
NEUT10|Business, so I'm interested to see how they plan to rebound from that.
NEUT11|They say they said at the time of the announcement that they'll be able to replace all that loss revenue within a couple of years, so I want to know how.
BULL12|Their credit card business, so they are going to be a big beneficiary of rising interest rates.
NEUT13|And because the big banks kind of surprised us with their.
BULL14|Default rates dropped, their credit quality is improving, so I want to see if synchrony is.
NEUT15|If they're doing this.
BULL16|If they're trending the same way, it could be a big a big profitability boost for the company.
NEUT17|And once the ticker for Synchrony syf F OK, good deal.
NEUT18|I'm going to be watching Ameris Bancorp ticker is ABC be they are a little community bank based out of Moultrie, GA folks who've followed me for any period of time.
NEUT19|Though I've been following this bank for quite some time.
NEUT20|They have earnings coming out on Friday.
NEUT21|It's it's always been really a story of growing their assets under under management and growth from the financial crisis really was was a neat part of the story early on, with a lot of those failed institutions from the Great Recession, they essentially had these FDIC aided acquisitions which pretty much protected him from any downside while helping them grow out.
BEAR22|The actual customer base, an asset based there, and so this is a very well run bank that is seen a little bit of a pullback here recently.
NEUT23|With the market volatility.
NEUT24|But still I think a lot of a lot of things to like about what they're doing is still just a small cap.
NEUT25|You know?
NEUT26|I mean, we talk about big banks.
NEUT27|This is a $2 billion market cap bank here, but earnings out on Friday, I'd be interested to see what they have to tell us in.
BULL28|"Also just just a note, we have PayPal earnings coming out this week is well on Thursday, so will will certainly cover that on next week show."""
