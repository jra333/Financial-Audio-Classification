NEUT0|"""8% if Congress does approve the tax changes for more, let's bring in the analyst behind the note Manish Pandey."
BULL1|Thank you very much Manish for joining us and 8% hit to earnings.
NEUT2|Why isn't it being reflected in the market at this point?
NEUT3|If that's what's going to happen?
NEUT4|So, so I think the answer is that the 8% hit is, you know if all the all the proposals that the Biden administration has proposed its fact sheet would get implemented.
NEUT5|And that's a big if I think.
NEUT6|So right now, market participants are probably taking a wait and see approach to see if all the proposals that have been put forward can actually be inactive.
NEUT7|So as you know, there is a very slim majority for the Democrats and there is going to be a lot of probable changes that could happen over the next few months.
NEUT8|Yeah, mansions already talking bout?
NEUT9|25% not necessarily as high as 28%.
NEUT10|Where would you look to see a fell off or a re rating certain industries or sectors names that would be hardest hit by that higher tax rate.
NEUT11|Sure, so so if you look at, you know our our approach sort of design at the single stock level so we can look at how they approach, how they impact is across sectors.
NEUT12|So if you look at the sectors that get impacted the most as you might expect it at their most multinationals, so that includes the technology sector, both the hardware and the software.
NEUT13|Some of the multinational healthcare companies.
BEAR14|So those are the ones we should get hit the most and and you know over the last few days those stocks actually have not, you know, underperformed materially.
NEUT15|So if if this was to happen then you know those are the start.
BEAR16|Switch will get affected with this.
NEUT17|Yeah, you said if a couple of times right?
NEUT18|That's the Golden word here.
NEUT19|But what's the reality like?
NEUT20|What do you?
NEUT21|What do you really expect is going to happen?
NEUT22|And is this 8% predicated on the corporate rate going up to 28?
NEUT23|As the president we know wants but is highly unlikely given some of the commentary already from the caucus.
NEUT24|Right, so in terms of the numbers itself, there are three sort of separate proposals that the administration has put forward.
NEUT25|Number one, as you said, is taking the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.
NEUT26|But then there are two other measures.
NEUT27|Number one is to also increase the amount of taxes that the multinational pay on their foreign income and the second, which is sort of a novel idea which is to have sort of four alternate minimum tax based on the gap income, not the taxable income, but the gap income.
NEUT28|That the company reports.
NEUT29|So in terms of the 8% number, you know that we calculate about half of that is coming from.
NEUT30|Assuming that the corporate tax rate goes from 21 to 28% and the other two factors are account for the other four.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
