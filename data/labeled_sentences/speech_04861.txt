NEUT0|"""So this is some big news on Microsoft."
NEUT1|We're just getting here.
BULL2|The Pentagon is announcing that Microsoft has won a contract to build more than 120,000 HoloLens augmented reality headsets for the US Army.
NEUT3|And this contract could be worth up to $22 billion / 10 years.
NEUT4|A Microsoft spokesperson telling CNBC.
NEUT5|Remember those standard issue HoloLens?
NEUT6|They cost about $3500 and the technology allows people to see holograms overlaid.
NEUT7|Their real world environments in addition.
BULL8|Being able to use their hand and voice gestures, it has found use in the commercial sector from companies like Lockheed Martin an Airbus interesting to see how Microsoft has been winning in securing these military contracts.
NEUT9|You all remember just a few years ago.
BULL10|They secure that nearly $500 million contract with the US Army for headsets based on this same HoloLens technology.
BULL11|Of course they won that $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Defense Department.
BULL12|They beat out Amazon.
NEUT13|That's how tide up in courts.
NEUT14|But now we have another one here.
BULL15|Again, the Pentagon is saying Microsoft has won this contract to build 120,000 HoloLens AR headsets worth 22 billion / 10 years back to you all.
BULL16|Josh, thanks so much for that.
BULL17|We're seeing a reaction in the stock.
NEUT18|I just have a quick question.
BULL19|Up 2.6% Josh.
NEUT20|So.
NEUT21|So where is who?
NEUT22|Are the big competitors when it comes to some of the technology players?
NEUT23|I remember they fought Amazon so hard for that cloud contract and Amazon I think challenged it right in court is that who is that who their top editor is?
NEUT24|It comes to these kind of deals.
BEAR25|So that cloud computing contract Jedi was worth up to $10 billion that has run into trouble with Amazon.
BEAR26|They're they're fighting over that one in federal court.
NEUT27|I think when you talk about competitors, why does this matter to investors?
NEUT28|Serious matters because a lot of technologists in a lot of big tech companies do believe that ARN VR is the next big, important platform.
NEUT29|They see that as the platform to watch post smartphone post PC.
NEUT30|It's why you see so many big tech companies.
NEUT31|Playing so much money, time and effort, everybody from Apple to Google in this and now Satya Nadella coming out an really shooting and scoring with this new contract.
NEUT32|One in wrinkle here would be to watch how do Microsoft employees feel about this.
BULL33|We have seen some pushback in the past.
BEAR34|Some tech employees including Microsoft employees have said they're not always comfortable working with American military.
NEUT35|With American warfighters though, Satya Nadella has said and told the press listen, that is a role his company is going to keep playing there and it keeps applying technology.
BULL36|The democratically elected governments guys, Josh, thanks so much, is taking Microsoft games for the day up to 3%.
BULL37|Tire takes the NASDAQ composite above 2% of gains.
NEUT38|Now as we speak.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
