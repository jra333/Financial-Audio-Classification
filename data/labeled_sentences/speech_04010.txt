NEUT0|"""Hey everyone Michael here with your daily GameStop update today."
NEUT1|There's going to be a lot of money made guys.
NEUT2|Check this out.
NEUT3|So of course after hours yesterday we saw this little rally come up from about 1:15 all the way back up to what?
NEUT4|One?
NEUT5|Thirty three 134th.
BULL6|That's fantastic.
NEUT7|We want to hold this level of support around 1:13 if it does not hold that we might go all the way back down to the 80s but do not fear if it breaks 113.
NEUT8|I'm probably going to load up on puts and probably a lot of them if I go down to the hour chart.
NEUT9|Maybe this will make a little bit clear.
NEUT10|This is where the level support was a way back over here.
NEUT11|Back, you know she's a long time ago.
NEUT12|Let's just say that, but if it breaks down, will going back down to 80s.
NEUT13|And that's where you're going to make a lot of money buying puts.
NEUT14|If you guys don't know much about options, options are a great way to make a lot of money very fast, but they are extremely risky, so be very careful if you guys are not used to them.
NEUT15|Take a second and learn up on him before he couldn't.
NEUT16|GameStop if you guys are just buying shares or you guys are doing fractional shares, put your stop loss at 113 just to be safe and then if it does decide to write up to like maybe.
NEUT17|Test out this level of resistance at 1:40 or 153.
NEUT18|Hey, you can start to scale out there and you can take your profits.
NEUT19|But be very careful.
NEUT20|I don't want you guys losing money, I just want you guys to minimize your losses and maximize your gains.
NEUT21|That's the whole goal of my channel.
NEUT22|My goal is to make sure that you guys can survive more than a month more than a year in the market.
NEUT23|I've been in the market for about 7 years now and it's not as easy as people want you to think.
BEAR24|So many people are going to get left out.
BEAR25|So many people are going to lose money today off of GameStop because they're not going to have a stop loss.
NEUT26|They're not going to be safe about it.
NEUT27|And then just kind of yellow money to make a point.
NEUT28|Your only goal is to make money.
NEUT29|Be a narcissist about making money.
NEUT30|Guys, I employ you.
NEUT31|Only goal is to make money.
NEUT32|Yes, and later on I will actually show you some dark pool prints and some option flow data.
NEUT33|That way you guys can see where the hedge funds are moving the money.
NEUT34|That way you guys can copy them because hedge funds usually have a good idea what's about to make money.
NEUT35|I don't know why.
NEUT36|Maybe it's insider trading, maybe it's something like that.
NEUT37|Hedge funds usually know where the money is going.
NEUT38|So I you know I'm going to show you guys some of that data.
NEUT39|It's not cheap, but I'm going to show you guys for free.
NEUT40|Now please make sure to subscribe to the channel so you can help me out in that respect an I'll do my part by showing you guys awesome content and giving you guys data that normally cost a lot of money.
NEUT41|So for now just make sure that GameStop holds over $113.00 if it does not, I'm going to buy some puts and just be safe about it.
NEUT42|It could also just right up to 141 or 153.
NEUT43|So take your time.
NEUT44|Make sure you have a plan before you buy and make sure that you stick to your plan and you don't get little freaking emotional.
NEUT45|I don't want drama Queens on my channel guys.
NEUT46|I want people that want to make money.
NEUT47|"Thanks everyone and make sure to subscribe."""
