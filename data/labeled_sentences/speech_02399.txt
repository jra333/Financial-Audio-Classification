NEUT0|"""Yeah, he also."
NEUT1|Surprisingly the options market is only implying about a 2 1/2 percent move in either direction on Wednesday following disease results.
BEAR2|But on average the stock is only moved about 1.7% over the last four quarters.
BULL3|Call volume was two times that of puts today, but just a little disclaimer here.
BEAR4|It looked like there was a lot of people closing out of calls above the market here in March, so not exactly a bullish or bearish endorsement from what I could tell.
NEUT5|The chart setup is really interesting here.
NEUT6|You know the one year it's been in about a 20 point range.
NEUT7|It's kind of like right at the midpoint here.
BEAR8|At about 1:11 here, so it's really been consolidating.
NEUT9|But what I found really interesting about it was look at the five year.
BULL10|I mean, I'm going to do my best Carter worth here.
NEUT11|Look at this thing right here, obviously since its 2015 highs it's been in this kind of wedge.
NEUT12|I guess you would call it a series of higher lows, but a series of lower highs and it broke out last year.
NEUT13|Above that you take out the December massacre here and maybe you have a little support or long term support.
NEUT14|At 1:10 a beat and raise and you could have this thing on its way back.
NEUT15|Up near 122, that was its all time high in 2015 Ryan looking lines you got there and the line from the peak at 122 is the Star Wars.
NEUT16|The stock ultimately is headed back there all right.
BULL17|Thanks for the action Dan.

NEUT19|"Fridays 5:30 PM Eastern Time Final trades up next."""
