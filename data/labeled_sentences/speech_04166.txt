NEUT0|"""What's up traders?"
NEUT1|Welcome to another C Space trading video.
NEUT2|As always, subscribers welcome, let's go ahead and hop into the technical analysis on Amazon, so I haven't done too many on Amazon.
BEAR3|I've been watching this this channel here and really thought it was getting weak as we approach $2000 a share.
NEUT4|You can go back and check.
NEUT5|I have been saying this, you just didn't look wig or better opportunities out there.
NEUT6|And of course Amazon prove me wrong.
NEUT7|I proved a lot of people wrong and exploded yesterday off some news about Morgan Stanley placing this $2500 a share by December.
NEUT8|So everyone got excited.
NEUT9|Volume came in and push this thing up.
BEAR10|However I hate to trade on news from these professionals.
NEUT11|As you know what?
NEUT12|Why would they tell you this?
NEUT13|Going $2500 a share?
NEUT14|Why wouldn't they buy as much as they can at these levels where it currently sits?
NEUT15|I mean, it is what it is, but try to you know.
NEUT16|Trade what you see, not what you hear, and that's just kind of my wisdom for today, so take that.
NEUT17|So, as I say that today it did run up here, you know, didn't have no issue.
NEUT18|Person up $2000 a share, which I thought they've got bigger wall in that, but it being a trillion dollar valuation, everybody was.
NEUT19|I guess fear of missing out is what they say.
NEUT20|So people jumped in high volume, pushed it up.
NEUT21|However, what did it do?
BULL22|It touched the top of that Channel, which we've been seeing for quite some time.
NEUT23|It's been trading this channel since April and it reversed.
NEUT24|Down into an hour and you'll see what happened.
BULL25|It popped it a little bit.
NEUT26|It set there, he sat there and then it fell back down the last couple hours of the day.
BULL27|It actually had a good volume here by the same amount of volume on that last hour to push it back up.
NEUT28|For basically, this is the opening or closing yesterday and opening up today, so.
NEUT29|Uhm?
NEUT30|Or is it possibly going to go?
NEUT31|It's a good time to get in a short I believe, but I wouldn't like.
NEUT32|I said I don't.
NEUT33|I don't play Amazon short.
NEUT34|I don't care if it is at the top of this channel.
NEUT35|I'd recommend you not doing so either, even though it is a good short play.
NEUT36|It possibly could sit here for another day or two and then come back.
NEUT37|I highly doubt it.
NEUT38|Doubt it because the markets running currently.
NEUT39|And this thing is going to move with the market and it is a monster and his Amazon.
NEUT40|So we'll have to wait and see.
NEUT41|Continue to watch.
NEUT42|I've gotta fill this thing.
NEUT43|May sit here for another day and then take back off again and it's ride this channel out for the next few days.
NEUT44|So that's just my luck on it.

BEAR49|I got some on Ba BA and think about getting doing one on Tesla even though Elon Musk seems to be losing its grip on test a little bit.
NEUT50|But the way I think about it, he's released.
NEUT51|SpaceX runs on the floor, so.
NEUT52|Something's got to be right anyway.
