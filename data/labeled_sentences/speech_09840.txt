NEUT0|"""Hey guys and welcome to the channel and this video in a daily update on Gevo."
NEUT1|I'll be talking about the price action that we saw today as well as talk about earnings because we do have earnings coming up on Wednesday and then at the end of the video I'll give my price predictions for tomorrow.
NEUT2|So stick around.
NEUT3|But before I get into the video, make sure to subscribe button to keep up with the daily videos and check out the links in the description to join the page around in the discord.
BEAR4|Looking at the stock today we closed today at $9.89, which is about 2% down for the day and currently the stock is at $9.86 in the after hours.
BEAR5|So compared to the rest of the market, we didn't have that great of a day today.
NEUT6|But we did have some more articles coming out giving their thoughts in the upcoming.
NEUT7|Earnings report for Gevo and how the company might fare.
NEUT8|So just a few days ago we talked about the upcoming earnings for Gevo, but I would do a daily update on it since we are getting closer to the actual earnings date.
BULL9|So in that video I did talk about how I'm excited for Gebos earnings because of a great feeling that they're going to be expectations by quite a bit, which could bring some height back to the stock and push the stock upwards.
BULL10|One of the reasons why I think this stock is a great chance to be earnings is because they've already moved up the earnings day a day early from Thursday to Wednesday.
NEUT11|We've already known that for like a week or so now.
BULL12|But we do have some analysts have continued to revise their earnings estimates, which typically is a good sign.
BEAR13|The most recent estimates are now showing an expected loss of $0.03 per share compared to the expected loss of $0.04 per share when we last talked about Gevo about a week or so ago.
BULL14|Which doesn't seem like it's much, but that's a pretty decent increase of about 25%.
NEUT15|As his analyst revised their estimates for earnings.
BEAR16|Also, the estimates for revenue are just so low I don't see Gevo not being it.
BULL17|Typically, if I don't already have a position before earnings, I'll wait until after for a dip, but I'm a feeling we're going to see them be expectations and that will give the stock some light and push the stock price higher.
NEUT18|Either way, as you guys know from other videos, I still see Jibo hitting $50 by the end of the year.
NEUT19|If you want to know why I think this exactly will be a video popping up the top screen right now, you can click that and it just gives you an overview of the company NYC hitting $50 this year.
NEUT20|Now as far as price predictions for tomorrow goes, we're still early in the after hours right now, so we don't have access to futures yet.
BULL21|But I'm not a big fan of futures anyways, so I think tomorrow we will be back up above $10 and close a day between $10.25 and $10.50.
NEUT22|So we have tomorrow heading up.
BULL23|Up until earnings on Wednesday, I think we will see a slight Green Day to bring us back over $10 before we have a bit of a run up on Wednesday before the earnings announcement.
NEUT24|But what do you guys think about Jeep?
NEUT25|Oh, let me know your price predictions down below and also let me know if you think Dave will be or miss earnings.
NEUT26|"Also just remember, this video is not financial advice, it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
