NEUT0|"""I don't think they'll be anything on a standalone basis."
BULL1|You know, I would hope that by tomorrow we either have an understanding on an overall package that doesn't mean obviously there wouldn't be a lot more work to do, but I am hopeful that we can come to an overall understanding.
NEUT2|And if we do that, hopefully the airlines will postpone their actions.
NEUT3|The Treasury Secretary.
NEUT4|With our Becky quick last Wednesday saying that there wouldn't be, it didn't see any standalone aid for airlines.
BULL5|Jim, of course, the president is now calling for that exact same thing immediately, and it's one reason why the XL is up almost 3%.
BULL6|Well, there's a lot of positive notes about the airlines today.
NEUT7|It's funny.
BEAR8|The only negative note was a downgrade of Southwest.
BULL9|And yet we are Gary Kelly yesterday to say some good things.
NEUT10|So you go through the downgrade and they're frankly they're not in trouble.
NEUT11|Some of these other companies, obviously, is the United they recommended today.
NEUT12|Why 'cause they can weather the storm?
NEUT13|It is much more about the layoffs than it is about their viability to try to get the layoffs off the table.
BEAR14|Layoffs are equating to areas of the country that will not be served, and we know the Congress is very worried ahead of Election Day that the planes to these small towns will be shut down and David, you know, there's nothing worse than in in the face of a voter that you just lossed The only way that you can get to from Dayton to New York.
NEUT15|You know my my daughter food from New York to Dayton.
NEUT16|Yes, it was like way more expensive than flying him a lot.
NEUT17|Yeah, well these days things are extraordinarily cheap, but you're right and that does get the attention of your elected representatives, whether they be a senator or Congress person, they pay close attention to that.
NEUT18|And that's one thing the airlines have in terms of negotiating leverage here.
NEUT19|But Jim, what chance do you really think is that they're going to get a one off aid package before end of the year?
BEAR20|Well, I think that there's a lot of bad blood.
NEUT21|Between the White House and Speaker closing.
BEAR22|Or there's bad blood on the White House side.
NEUT23|Yeah, we know that, but what does that mean for the airlines getting some money?
NEUT24|It could be some emergency thing that they do watch them come up with a rabbit out of a hat.
NEUT25|For the airlines you know.
NEUT26|Following tax receipts, yeah, you can do that stuff.
NEUT27|David.
NEUT28|Yeah, be creative David.
NEUT29|OK, I'll try.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT31|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
