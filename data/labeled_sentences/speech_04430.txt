NEUT0|"""When he got Lowe's, Lowe's does 28% David same store Home Depot did not do that."
NEUT1|They did only 24 so people are going to like what Marvin Ellison has done more than like Home Depot.
NEUT2|Now Home Depot put the good didn't increase that.
BULL3|A decent call but they were not as effusive as Marvin Ellison is today.
BULL4|I think Mark is going to have an unbelievable spring because this is the year that I think that they're going to be able to really put the wood to Home Depot.
NEUT5|Yet when it comes to now wait, let me just stop you for a moment because I want to plant so Plant City outdoor you've been talking about.
NEUT6|Some of the retailers that will benefit from the we're outta here.
NEUT7|We're back into the world, right?
NEUT8|And clearly?
NEUT9|Lowe's and Home Depot are not amongst that group given their comparisons as well are going to be pretty tough one with things they are going to be very hard, but I think Lowe's had.
NEUT10|Marvin inherited a company that really didn't even have it ecommerce, and he's putting through things in e-commerce that are going to make it so that the comparisons are going to better.
BEAR11|Their ecommerce site was quite weak.
NEUT12|Remember Christmas time for these guys.
NEUT13|This is spring now.
NEUT14|There was a garden season last year 'cause you could garden.
NEUT15|It was very popular, but you're right.
NEUT16|I mean, is this as good as as I don't know Aeropostale.
NEUT17|I mean, there's some companies in the mall that are.
BULL18|Tapestry is doing quite well right?
NEUT19|But I do think that Lowe's versus Home Depot.
NEUT20|You go with Lowe's.
NEUT21|You go with Lowe's versus Home Depot if you want to continue to be invested.
BULL22|I mean, in those companies exactly right got it and I think that Lowe's Ellison's done a remarkable job, but the company was very far off its game versus Home Depot is playing catch up, but he's going to catch it.
NEUT23|Really, I really do think so.
BULL24|Yes, the stores look great.
NEUT25|By the way.
NEUT26|I mean, you could possibly for some time, but I haven't heard you say that.
NEUT27|Well.
BULL28|The stores look great, the websites getting better, it still has availability issues, but I do think that what what moms doing is basically saying OK look, we know that the contractors are going to go to Home Depot.
NEUT29|They're going to come with us too.
NEUT30|But David Lowe's is back having what I regard as being a place and this is just my wife, so it's anecdotal women like to shop for garden at Lowe's.
NEUT31|Again, like they used to.
NEUT32|Number for Home Depot really come on and not by the way, Home Depot.
NEUT33|Could you like enough have the Scotts miracle grow plants?
BEAR34|Get me some better flats with the flats are weak at Home Depot.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
