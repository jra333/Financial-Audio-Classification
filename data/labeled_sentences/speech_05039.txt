BULL0|"""I think it's a year of challenge."
BULL1|Fundamentally, I think it's a year of opportunity in terms of the stock, so look, this stock is corrected 40% off of its highs, so clearly the markets, the financial markets view is that this is going to be your challenge and the facts are there going to have at least three major ODT launches over the top launches.
NEUT2|Disney, Apple, AT&T, Time Warner.
BULL3|We think, however, that Netflix is fundamentals will power through this, its global presence.
NEUT4|It's banned, the scale of its offering and exclusivity of its offering.
BULL5|I think all of that allows Netflix to power through.
NEUT6|People are going to reach for a couple of these OT services, but we're pretty certain that one of those in that newly reconstructed bundle is going to be Netflix.
NEUT7|So we like the stock here.
NEUT8|It's one of our top picks for 2019, not precisely because of this setup.
NEUT9|You're not worried about their production spend.
NEUT10|You're not worried about their debt.
NEUT11|Those are both things to worry about.
NEUT12|The question is do they are they?
NEUT13|Are they going to be able to correctly match the amount of content they need that they need against the sub growth that is required to and you know, look they've been able to do it for the last five years every once in awhile they screw up.
NEUT14|It's hard to be perfect every quarter, but generally have a pretty good track record of doing this, and they're doing this as the leading player in what is really an explosive scale category secular growth category.
NEUT15|It wouldn't be an explosive secular growth category or the obvious sign that it is.
NEUT16|Are these three new OT entrance?
NEUT17|We can work through that in terms of the debt without a specific comment on the on, the debt that the company has, we think the leverage ratios here are very reasonable by traditional media standards, and we look at how the debt rates.
NEUT18|I don't think that's anything.
BEAR19|Let's talk about 2/2 hurting stocks.
NEUT20|One is Facebook, the other is snapped.
NEUT21|Yeah, if you had to buy one today, which would it be?
NEUT22|Facebook, there's no question about it.
BEAR23|An Facebook is, you know, you talked about the Fang stocks and I look at those that I think the fundamentals for Amazon, Netflix and Google have been shockingly consistent over the last year.
BULL24|The last 2-3 years have actually kind of accelerated up, and we've had record high margins of two of those companies, and I think those fundamental trends will hold right intact going into next year.
NEUT25|Facebook's really the outlier.
BEAR26|That's where we're seeing declining satisfaction, which users and advertisers.
NEUT27|But we think that's so more than priced into the stock now.
NEUT28|I think it's got the best risk.
NEUT29|Reward these single best risk.
BULL30|Reward with a 12 month outlook.
BULL31|We may not see much movement talking to the back half of next year, but we think growth rates can stabilize margins, can stabilize, and if you can be patient about it, we think you can make very good returns on a stock.
NEUT32|"Buying it right here."""
