NEUT0|"""Hey guys, it's earlier."
NEUT1|I just got off a conference call with a couple of investors and we talk about Disney Disney.
NEUT2|Of course today is the big story.
BEAR3|Stock is selling off right now, about 5% here at about 11:00 AM Eastern on May the 11th and the financial media is having a field day out there.
BEAR4|Basically the company missed both top and bottom line estimates and the stock is falling now.
NEUT5|I'm not entirely sure why that's such a huge surprise or why people are making that big deal of it.
NEUT6|We are very late in a cycle expansion.
NEUT7|In fact, I think we.
BEAR8|I've already seen very, you know, reasonable, very reasonable evidence that we have been slowing down both in economic data terms as well as in corporate profits.
NEUT9|So I'm not sure why that's a epic surprise.
NEUT10|But if we look at the chart here, I want to just give you guys a little bit of perspective of what we are looking at here at the desk.
NEUT11|And first of all, let's just zoom out in the chart here.
NEUT12|Make it multi year and again, that's where we gain our perspective from, right?
NEUT13|So first of all, let's keep in mind that's very simply, this stock has already been selling off for quite some time.
NEUT14|We had a double top here with the July 2015 top and then the November 2015 top so you know plenty of top sort of take your teeth into.
NEUT15|And then.
NEUT16|We basically have this trend break right?
NEUT17|And you can see that basically right now.
BEAR18|As the stock is rejecting here we are rejecting the stock at a key confluence resistance area.
NEUT19|OK, and I don't think a lot of people look at this kind of stuff, which is why they're so surprised when this stuff happens.
NEUT20|Let's just have a look at this, and I want to just give you guys a little perspective.
BULL21|So again, we've confluence resistance area where the stock is coming to.
NEUT22|So for one that confluence resistance is as you as you can see, we just retested what used to be a support line, right?
BEAR23|We kept bouncing off that blue line.
BULL24|It's now become support.
NEUT25|Let me get rid of that line to kind of clean up the chart.
NEUT26|Make it a little bit more clear for you.
NEUT27|Then we have the 50 week moving average that's this yellow line and you can see that line had been holding as support fairly cleanly.
NEUT28|Then it got a little choppy here last summer as volatility picked up, but we're now coming back into that area.
BULL29|Lastly, we have a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement from those highs up here in December last December.
BEAR30|Down to the lows of February.
NEUT31|So we traced just about 61.8% which from you.
NEUT32|Nachi perspective is quite important with confluence resistance area here.
NEUT33|Now this doesn't mean you have to go out right, and so all your stock or get short the stock.
NEUT34|Give it a time.
NEUT35|This needs probably 1-2 three days to kind of see how the stock reacts, but if we continue to feel heavy later on today, tomorrow, maybe even by Friday, then I do think this doc here sets up for a trait to the downside, maybe even to revisit those those high 80s here through next, you know, maybe through the summer at some point so.
NEUT36|That's kind of what I'm looking at here.
NEUT37|Keeping it very simple, gain perspective.
NEUT38|See what the streets talking about in terms of what's the chatter Chatter was very bullish.
NEUT39|Brother went on Disney coming into yesterday, so really not a great surprise to see that type of reaction either.
NEUT40|So anyway guys, that's what I'm looking at.
NEUT41|Please give us a like on the video that would move me up in YouTube pranks.
NEUT42|Got a lot of exciting stuff coming in my channel.
NEUT43|We're starting A blog.
NEUT44|I'm starting A blog so you're going to be able to follow me along throughout my day.
NEUT45|Kind of see what I'm what's happening when I get my phone calls.
NEUT46|When I do where I trade from what I do.
NEUT47|So that's all going to happen here in the next couple of months.
NEUT48|"As summer kicks off, you guys take care and I'll see you next video."""
