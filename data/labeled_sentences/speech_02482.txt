NEUT2|Let's go back to August 4th, 2015 for the beginning of this analysis.
NEUT3|That's when Walt Disney Stock reached its all time high of $122.08, and it's been one of the most boring stocks in the markets ever since.
BEAR4|The share price has been lingering between $122 and $86 for almost three years now.
NEUT5|The last time we wrote about it.
BEAR6|Disney was trading slightly below the $96 mark that was in August 2016.
NEUT7|Yesterday, the market closed just over $104.00, but that is definitely not what we meant by mid term rally.
BULL8|An 8% return in 18 months is not our idea of a good investment.
NEUT9|The choice to make is whether to hold or just give up and sell.
NEUT10|But first, let's see how Disney stock has been developing.
NEUT11|While we're waiting for it to rise.
NEUT12|This daily chart visualizes what wasting my time means in the market.
NEUT13|Disney practically went nowhere during the recent couple of years.
BEAR14|It moved down to $86, then up to 116, then down to 96 and back up to 113.
BULL15|In mid February 2018, the stock was touching $100 again.
NEUT16|Obviously if you check the word progress in the dictionary, you won't find a picture of Disney's logo.
BULL17|On the other hand, the company still achieved something.
NEUT18|It formed a recognizable pattern called the Triangle, which comes to tell us that there is still hope for Disney Stock Bulls.
NEUT19|A triangle consists of five subways moving sideways in the contracting variety.
BEAR20|Every wave is smaller than the previous one.
NEUT21|Also, each of the five waves has a 3 way structure.
NEUT22|The daily chart of Disney stock shows the five waves labeled A through E, in brackets, waves A&B and brackets are simple ABC zigzags while Wave CD&E in brackets have taken the shape of an WXY double.
NEUT23|Zigzag triangles, just like any other correction only interrupt a larger trend.
BULL24|Since Disney was in an uptrend before the triangle began, we can now expect it to resume once the pattern is finally over.
NEUT25|If this count is indeed correct, wave Ian brackets isn't supposed to breach the lowest point of wave C in brackets.
BULL26|This makes 96 point, $2.00 an appropriate invalidation level for the bullish outlook.
BULL27|As long as Disney trades above this key figure, $130 is a plausible target.
BULL28|It looks like Mickey Mouse is finally ready to break out from his prison like the video.
