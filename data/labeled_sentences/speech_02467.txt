NEUT0|"""Favorite stocks for next year?"
NEUT1|Well I like.
NEUT2|I like companies that have you know that in my opinion still have great long term prospects and are suffering from you know what I would envision our short term difficulties.
NEUT3|And frankly I don't want to invest in the things that have gone up 80 or 90%.
NEUT4|You know we own stocks like Navios, Maritime Manpower, Activision.
BULL5|I mean we have some big winners in our portfolios.
BULL6|That's why we're up 30%.
NEUT7|I'd rather focus on the things that haven't performed the material sector, so names like mosaic names like Freeport, MC Moran, Copper and Gold.
NEUT8|And even pure gold players if you will like a Newmont Mining.
NEUT9|I like consumer some of the consumer names, especially in the retail space that have been kind of beat up here.
NEUT10|One of those is target, I think target is an excellent value investment in that relatively safe investment with a very nice dividend yield now another company in that space if you want to be a little more aggressive as American Eagle Outfitters, the teen apparel retailer American Eagle has a fantastic balance sheet.
NEUT11|No debt.
BEAR12|$2.00 a share in cash stock price down 20% on the year.
BULL13|Market, that's up, you know 25% as there are still bargains out there.
NEUT14|And here's a company with a great dividend yield as well over 3 1/2% and that space.
NEUT15|The teen retailing space you go up and down with the fashion cycles.
NEUT16|And frankly you go up and down now with the economic cycles too.
BEAR17|And so we had a tough time in the back to school season.
NEUT18|Tough time in the summer and I believe those things are cyclical.
BULL19|If we believe the economy is going to grow faster next year than it is this year, I think we'll see a better backdrop if you will, for the.
NEUT20|For the retailers, so retail stocks look attractive, I mentioned energy company like Holly Frontier in the refining space.
BEAR21|Keep in mind the refining refiners had margins that were this wide and then all of a sudden they contracted like this.
BEAR22|Well, that's again a cyclical factor in my mind anyways, that ultimately will regress back to more of a mean and so Hollyfrontier believe it or not continues to pay out a huge dividend yield.
NEUT23|There is 7% when you count in the special dividends that they have paid consistently over the last couple of years.
BULL24|So that's an attractive name.
NEUT25|And then we also like the big oil majors, the international ones, like a total out of France an any ticker symbol E out of Italy.
NEUT26|So lots of opportunities.
NEUT27|I mentioned tech big cap tech.
NEUT28|Certainly like Apple and Cisco.
BULL29|Given the beating it's taken here recently I think is attractive.
NEUT30|Intel Intel is a dividend yield 4% IBM, another company that in my mind is still on track to make their $20 a share by 2015 units.
NEUT31|Stock trading at 175 or 180.
NEUT32|You know, that's a.
BULL33|That's an inexpensive company in any market, but in one where again interest rates are so low and valuations are elevated for many companies, I think IBM as attractive as well Microsoft.
NEUT34|We can add Microsoft into that mix as well and undervalue for 12 years now it has and we haven't owned it for 12 years but but again, we've owned it for awhile.
NEUT35|But you know, one of the things I think investors misses that you're getting a big dividend.
NEUT36|So when you think about total return on some of these companies, yeah, your stock price may not have gone gone.
BULL37|That very far, but you throw in the dividends that compound over time and you still get a decent return.
BULL38|So I like Microsoft, but Microsoft is actually performed a little better right then.
NEUT39|There are others here lately.
NEUT40|You know with the Balmer exit being a catalyst, which of course if you're Steve Ballmer, you're probably not too happy about you having the big rally in the stock.
NEUT41|But some of the other names I mentioned you know haven't had their big rally up.
BULL42|Of course, I still like Apple, which obviously thanks to Carl Icahn, has certainly had some interest from investors.
BEAR43|Ann has run up from.
NEUT44|Below 400 to 500, but we've been an Apple a long time having first bought it at $7.00 back in 2002, 2003.
BULL45|That's great.
NEUT46|"Too bad Adam and Eve didn't have that kind of Apple."""
