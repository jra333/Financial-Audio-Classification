NEUT0|"""Excluding this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL3|Well another day, higher highs and higher lows.
NEUT4|Yes, the price did pull back today from the high, so I realized that if you're some sort of day trader and you bought right there in your plan was to buy and sell within 10 minutes.
BEAR5|Well, then from that perspective, yeah, the chart doesn't look very good, but assuming you do care about the grand scheme of things, even with this pullback here, overall the chart is still chipping away.
NEUT6|Bit on those higher bases, and that's what matters most.
NEUT7|And that's what I would now call you know, the newest ideal level of support moving forward right there at 122.
NEUT8|Fifty ideal meaning for asked, you know, what make this chart look the absolute best going forward.
BULL9|And yeah, ideally speaking, if the price could stay up above one 2250.
BULL10|That would be a fantastic sign of power.
BEAR11|Now don't get me wrong, the price falls below that area.
NEUT12|That does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL13|But yeah, price could manage step above that level.
BULL14|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT15|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT16|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT17|The 50.
NEUT18|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT19|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there, being defined as the move, just watch that Purple line.
NEUT20|As long as the price stays above that line.
NEUT21|As a line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT22|Heard must visualize that.
NEUT23|That is what has been represented again.
NEUT24|Sure, stand above 122.
NEUT25|Fifty would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT26|All is going to be on 124, so keep an eye on that as that next key level and nothing fancy or complicated behind that.
NEUT27|That's just essentially where the party and momentum finally stopped today, so watch that moving forward.
BEAR28|But All in all higher highs, higher lows.
NEUT29|That's what matters most.
NEUT30|So let's see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL34|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT42|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT43|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
