NEUT0|"""That RX we start with one overcharged OK."
NEUT1|If we refer to one analyzes.
BEAR2|Since the price was here we mentioned we can expect the price to drop because we mentioned me we can look for flat for one more drop the price drop but it couldn't break this law.
NEUT3|Now the question is first how we can look for this weather this a correction in relative to this.
NEUT4|For one more drop or this is the start of the up move.
NEUT5|OK mostly we can see most of the charts the starting the up move.
NEUT6|That's why maybe even if you want to look for trade set up maybe we can look from here.
NEUT7|OK, now the question is whether we could look for one more drop before we get there next move.
NEUT8|OK, because for long term we're looking for my for sure.
NEUT9|If you get these opportunities.
NEUT10|I mean can give us better traits atop OK because in that case we can look for this one as a flat 123 and it down move them from from there we can look for reversal but.
NEUT11|As I mentioned, is still we can expect the price continue from here because of the different reasons.
NEUT12|The only times you can look for by if there is a continuation.
NEUT13|If we get any flag then maybe we can consider to look for buy.
NEUT14|But right now we don't jump into the trade because we know about the possibility for one more drop.
NEUT15|And even if you move the daily chart what we want to be looking at this correction.
NEUT16|We want to see whether the price can break the top 21.1 or not.
NEUT17|Rather than that we have nothing to discuss this on daily chart and.
BULL18|Based on forward chart is still we can see this one as a correction and relative to this that's why we mentioned if you get one more drop, any reversal can give us better treat set up.
NEUT19|But the only question is whether what we have here the sharp move.
NEUT20|And we explain if there is a continuation and flag.
NEUT21|Also, we can't look for traders mean we don't need to wait for one more drop before we look for by, but we need to be aware of the possibility.
NEUT22|OK, that's why if you get if there is a combination, if you get any trade setup we can look for by mostly with the short Move flag an if we didn't get any trade setup either.
NEUT23|We wait for the breakout of the 2.07 or 28.
NEUT24|This top then.
NEUT25|From there we look for trade or having in trouble this.
NEUT26|And we need to know having a trip of the top is already risky, because what we want we want surprise, break and continue the price tag which is not moving within one or two hours within the state with the trade.
NEUT27|OK anyway, we just follow the chart.
NEUT28|"If I see any update I will share, thanks."""
