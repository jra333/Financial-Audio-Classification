NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Mike Intel like to talk about Inspire MD Inc."
NEUT1|This stock trades on the NYSE under symbol NSPR.
BULL2|This stock was up a little over 1% up to 70%.
BULL3|It did move up after hours three cents up to $0.73.
NEUT4|This stock is following the pattern of the sub $1.00 stock that's making that March up toys $1.00.
NEUT5|I know a lot of people ask me hey what's the next sub $1.00 stock that could explode higher and I definitely think that's inspire MD so let's take a look at what the company does.
NEUT6|The company creates stints.
NEUT7|And this is basically an best protection that keeps the blood vessels open.
NEUT8|That helps prevent strokes mainly.
NEUT9|So this is basically a medical device company an as you see.
NEUT10|I think this product will be in huge demand because as are in the United States, as our population gets older, baby boomers get older.
NEUT11|They're going to.
NEUT12|There's going to be a need for stents, those medical procedures.
BULL13|So I think a company like this has some potential to really explode higher.
NEUT14|And I also think in 2021.
BULL15|A lot of these procedures that were probably delayed because of the pandemic will will happen in 2021, so that could create increased demand for inspire MD's medical products.
NEUT16|You look at the stock right now, this market caps really small at $42 million, so this is a stock that definitely has some potential to move higher if it can break the $1.00 market, definitely could make a quick run to $2.00 and then to $5 so this could potentially be, you know, a $200 million company over the next 12 months.
NEUT17|Definitely one that you could take a little bit of a.
BEAR18|Speculation with as with all these sub $1.00 stocks that are very.
NEUT19|They are very very volatile.
NEUT20|10% moves to the up and down side should be seen as really typical, so just be aware of that.
NEUT21|Don't try to put too much of your money into it.
BULL22|However, I do think there's a chance for some outsize returns over the next 12 months, so go ahead and check out inspire MD again.
NEUT23|It trades on the NYSE under symbol NSPR.
