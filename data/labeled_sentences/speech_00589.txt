NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Blaine with sfbtraders.com and I'm looking at stocks on watch for April the 26th."
NEUT1|I'm going to go through this relatively quickly.
NEUT2|I am hosting free day in the chat rooms.
NEUT3|So if you are interested in.
NEUT4|Joining us then go ahead and email me at blaine@cfbtraders.com and I'll let you in.
NEUT5|Today I'm going to go through this quickly 'cause I gotta bunch on watch and like I said, I'll discuss some more in the trading room today.
NEUT6|As they set up in today for entries.
NEUT7|So here we go.
BULL8|NPH little bit of a range break there looking for push towards 7 plus.
NEUT9|Yes, I had this on a watch list last week for some people.
NEUT10|On the forum and finally pop today.
NEUT11|So.
NEUT12|Excuse me, prefer popped on Thursday, so look at for the follow through over 20 so if you can't get a push higher towards maybe 25 or 30 in the coming days.
BEAR13|Gee, Tat made a higher low on the daily.
BULL14|Looks like if we can bust through that high, I think we can continue higher at least towards 4.
BULL15|This four is going to be pretty strong resistance from back in May and June of last year, but if they can break then just think you could probably get a pretty good run of it.
BULL16|Cris testing this recent downtrend from December like this for push higher back towards those highs.
BULL17|Atrs nice little break out today.
NEUT18|I'm looking for Pushover continuation Pushover 380.
BULL19|PSU is testing 52 week highs.
NEUT20|If we can breakthrough that high and from September I think this thing runs a little bit.
BULL21|SGML trying to break range here should get a push towards 11.
NEUT22|If you can do it.
NEUT23|DGI little bit higher price but like this for the 30 break keep this uptrend going.
NEUT24|YOD needs a lot of volume.
NEUT25|I normally don't try to play low volume stocks, but I like this setup.
BULL26|Expensive, can breakthrough that 175 mark.
NEUT27|Should least push towards 2 if not higher.
NEUT28|MLA style one year bottom chart here.
NEUT29|I mean, this thing was 440 a year ago.
NEUT30|Not seeing it goes back there, but I think we can get a little.
NEUT31|Pop off the bottom for trade out of it.
NEUT32|And SC YM I drew.
NEUT33|Line here, that actually does support back in May of last year and then resistance and resistance.
BULL34|So if we can break through this line then we should continue higher office bottoms been making.
NEUT35|Some higher lows there, so I like this chart set up.
NEUT36|There you go.
NEUT37|There's my quick watch list for April 26th.
NEUT38|Let me know if you guys have any questions below.
