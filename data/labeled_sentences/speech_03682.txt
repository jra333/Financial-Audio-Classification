NEUT0|"""One of the premises contest."
BEAR1|It was that big companies are getting bigger and there's an impact on the jobs market.
NEUT2|Does it feel like it because I can show you statistically that is true.
NEUT3|Take a look at what we did.
NEUT4|Look at the top ten companies by market cap in the S&P and took that as a percentage of the whole SNP, and now we're at 24% and more interesting leaves were coming at a time after it was declining for a lot for a lot of years there and Tyler when we last up near this area here 1998 it looks.
NEUT5|Yeah, kind of concentrations after that.
NEUT6|And you can do the same thing folks if you look at as a percentage of the total economy, we're now we're around about 120 market cap of the all S&P 500 companies is about 120% of GDP.
NEUT7|That's another way to look at.
NEUT8|Look at the expression on contested space.
BEAR9|She is absolutely floored by that.
NEUT10|So why does that matter economically?
BEAR11|It matters economically, because the concern is that there are fewer and fewer companies would, and it may explain why wages have not kept pace with this tight job market.
NEUT12|There's a concept we've talked about it on this show.
NEUT13|It's not new for all of our viewers.
NEUT14|Maybe some?
NEUT15|So we'll define it.
NEUT16|It's called monopsony.
NEUT17|And here it is.
NEUT18|It's basically a market situation where there's only one buyer and that would be from Monopoly, which is only one seller or overall control.
NEUT19|And here's what Alan Krueger, speaking to the folks in Jackson Hole said about monopsony monopsony power is probably always existed in labor markets.
BEAR20|But the forces that traditionally counterbalance monopsony power and boosted worker bargaining power have eroded in recent decades unions.
NEUT21|Unions you want to go on?
NEUT22|No no please.
BEAR23|I'm just guess there's others tell me the others I got one right minimum wage hasn't really risen or kept pace with inflation.
NEUT24|That would create a floor.
NEUT25|Also issues like non compete agreements, more andmore proliferating even done with the franchise level their noncompete agreements.
NEUT26|You can go even further and talk about outright collusion.
NEUT27|In some industries, Krueger and others talk about in the hospital business in certain towns and cities.
NEUT28|There's some collusion so.
BEAR29|All of this idea of greater power and bigger, bigger companies would tend to can be one factor in depressing wages.
NEUT30|According to many economists that are looking at this issue, so it's dominance of a single player or two, right?
NEUT31|And if you think about the labor market, right in this case, the monopsony buying power is buying labor.
BULL32|"Is buying waybright."""
