BULL0|"""Alright guys, we're here to do the tough task of going from 10 startups to five and it's really intense now."
NEUT1|Was Devils mentor Sessions really showed?
NEUT2|Who had the answers and who didn't?
NEUT3|I'm going to pretend I'm a venture capitalist and I'm going to rip your heads off.
NEUT4|Isn't there?
NEUT5|Is this attitude of Big Brother watching too much in the hospitals?
NEUT6|And you're just adding to that?
NEUT7|Even though I'm in the industry, I can't figure out this thing.
NEUT8|Can you please tell me as if I was your grandmother?
NEUT9|You better be able to explain your business, explain it simply and clearly.
NEUT10|To an audience of VCs or consumers or media, we should be thinking about whether Infinite has the ability to become not a small fish in a big pond.
NEUT11|But the big fish, I think, to move to the top five, you better have customers.
NEUT12|I don't know that I would agree that the startup need to have customers per say, but I do feel very strongly that showing a attention to potential customers and speaking to potential customers from the stage of product development is really important.
BULL13|I was really impressed with the muse because the way that those cofounders can really present themselves and the way that they really carry their company and what it represents is phenomenal.
NEUT14|It's not hard to do what you're doing anymore.
BULL15|I don't see how you differentiate yourself and how you really leap ahead of the big players right now, but we happen to be extremely competitive people and I think that there's going to be a massive winner in this space and I feel like we've gotten a great head start and have a very unique perspective issue for them.
NEUT16|I think this competition mean they do have a lot of competition, right?
BULL17|But anyone who's ever used a job site knows that there's a ton of room for improvement.
NEUT18|Are they taking longer periods of time to use your tool than they did previously?
NEUT19|But no.
NEUT20|So that's the kind of beauty of it is.
NEUT21|We're sort of cost competitive from the teachers point of view in terms of the amount of time they have this time.
NEUT22|Time to welcome.
NEUT23|I'm cost competitive, but I still think it's difficult going school to school.
BULL24|I think the scalability is a factor with nano satisfi.
NEUT25|They definitely have a product that's very useful that can answer to a huge issue of you know, gaining important information.
NEUT26|All of those companies but forgive me for giving, you're giving very high level.
NEUT27|I'm asking for something to the second time I've asked it.
NEUT28|Give me a specific company's specific challenges, specific experiment, what do they pay?
NEUT29|How do you charge them?
NEUT30|Make it a businesswoman?
NEUT31|What I'm hearing is different messages about who the customer base is to me means they have a little bit of work to do.
NEUT32|We obviously have wide.
NEUT33|Variety of opinions here.
BEAR34|"We're going to get down to 5."""
