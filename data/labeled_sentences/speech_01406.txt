BULL0|"""I think you know, probably for the whole year the central Bank of China will China's central bank will kind of help by another 20 basis point and I think you know from other hand the physical policy and the influx of policy will also coming up to boost the economy."
NEUT1|Of course you know everyone expect that the biggest hit will coming up will be taking place in the first quarter.
NEUT2|So basically if the economy can relatively kind of pick up in the second quarter, the most important thing is that.
NEUT3|How important or how kind of how big the impact of this kind of policy will help the economy to revive from that kind of from that kind of window violence heat so another 20 basis points are likely over the first quarter when it comes to the LPR.
BEAR4|How bad will the Q1 GDP number be?
NEUT5|You've got 5.4% for 2020 growth in China, but I was mentioning a little bit earlier overnight.
NEUT6|Morgan Stanley came out and is now forecasting Q1 growth at just three and a half percent.
BEAR7|Are you that pessimistic on the outlook?
NEUT8|For the first quarter, well, I think you know it's very hard to say to be honest, because we don't know how China will make up in the in the last month of this quarter, because I think everyone knows that the China gradually restarted production right now.
NEUT9|So I think in.
NEUT10|On the other hand, to be honest in Chinese number or it's very magic in the three percent 4%.
NEUT11|I don't think people really pay attention to the most important thing is that the real activities, for example, you know the power generation, the transportation logistics, the shipping, this kind of data.
NEUT12|I think the market will pay more attention to that.
NEUT13|And also the automobile sales.
NEUT14|I think that makes more sense for us to understand the Chinese economy dynamics there.
BULL15|China is of course now benefiting from fiscal and monetary stimulus and at the same time in easing in trade tensions.
NEUT16|Does that mean that optimism around AV shaped recovery is being priced by the markets?
NEUT17|Yes, I think so.
NEUT18|I think you know the market right now.
BULL19|Is looking at V shaped recovery from China, especially after the in afterward in aftermath of the virus going forward.
NEUT20|So I think you know there is some kind of risk from there because if you know the violence can't be really content according to the official estimates.
BULL21|And also if the foreign investors are still relatively histed to put money into China, I think the V shaped recovery will still save face.
NEUT22|A lot of uncertainties over there, so I think you know for the markets right now.
NEUT23|Probably have to be more realistic to look at the high frequency data from China and to look at how China resume its production from now on and how China contain the violence.
NEUT24|At this moment.
BEAR25|I think there are so many uncertainties over there.
BULL26|I think you know the market can't be over confident that the Chinese economy can be fully recovered can see a very shape.
BULL27|Very sharp recovery.
NEUT28|From Q2 onwards.
