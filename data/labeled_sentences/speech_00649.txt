NEUT0|"""It's playing this."
NEUT1|We have a video chart on ticker symbol SN DL.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to build some context here, but very impressive bonds in this one stop.
BULL6|Think about the fact that at one point the price was all the way down there, but it's now been able to battle back up to where it has good solid move.
NEUT7|But that does bring about the valid question of.
NEUT8|But is there any sort of true power behind this pricing?
NEUT9|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT10|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT11|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward, and in my mind intervals on a single area.
NEUT12|And that area is down here at.
NEUT13|The Dollar 13 mark was $1.13 important.
NEUT14|I'm not saying this was going to happen, but just for explanation.
NEUT15|Saying the price would come down to dollar thirteen behave in that manner and then continue on down.
NEUT16|What would that be doing with the price?
NEUT17|That would quite literally putting the price right back inside of that range where it just wasn't me not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT18|But price moves like go back to where they were not exactly sound true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT19|Now.
NEUT20|On the flip side of things, let's say the price because I mean no price is just going to go straight up to maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner and then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT21|Now what would you have all of a sudden in this situation?
NEUT22|Well you have a set of those right there.
NEUT23|You have loads right there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps will hey there we go.
NEUT24|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
BULL25|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT26|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $1.13 as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|Next key battleground to watch moving forward, going to be right up there at the dollar.
NEUT28|25 marks will keep a close eye on $1.25 is that will be that next main level to watch.
NEUT29|But overall anyway, look at it.
BULL30|Very impressive bounds today.
NEUT31|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird.
NEUT37|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT38|But in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
