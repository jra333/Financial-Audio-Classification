NEUT0|"""In this video, we're going to take a look at when we saw it."
NEUT1|Ever since it bottom back here somewhere around in the latter part of 2015.
NEUT2|Two oh D part of 2016.
NEUT3|He came up and book this little bit of a consolidation area and move back to somewhere near the 200 mark before it pulled back and test this consolidation area.
NEUT4|Except you doing a back test and try to make his way back toward that 200 level and you could see that there was a trend line.
BEAR5|That it was a hugging and try to find support there even during the pandemic when the February March sell off, it came down, but it did not find support because we know what happened that business, you know, the casino business and the other leisure related business is essentially shut down and people are just not traveling right because of the coronavirus.
NEUT6|And it came all the way down to the.
NEUT7|To the 30th we're it might now.
BULL8|Recently we got some good news in term of the vaccine, so things are looking little bit better because at least we could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
NEUT9|So most likely and hopefully by this time next year.
NEUT10|You know, a lot of people will be able to get vaccinated and life will be a little bit more normal than it is right now.
BEAR11|And I think by that time lost their leisure related.
BULL12|Company will start, you know, doing a little bit better than what they're doing now, so that's why I'm looking at when we saw it right now.
NEUT13|And as you can see, I have identified various potential support, an resistant song he ran right now is sitting right near this 106 resistance zone.
NEUT14|So basically looking for this thing to come to this resistance zone and possibly move back up to this 124 and then move to this 150 area.
NEUT15|And if we take a look at the dailies, drove down a data, you can see that you know right near the edge of this zone here.
NEUT16|So what I'm looking at is remember a lot of times we like to see a breakout and then come back down, back test and then move.
NEUT17|Then we try to get into here and put a stop close to it.
NEUT18|May be here or down here.
NEUT19|But since we already saw some of these, you know consolidation price action here.
NEUT20|What one could do is rather than wait.
NEUT21|Or the confirmation is to scale in once it get above this 106 area would have stopped just underneath here somewhere around that $100 level.
NEUT22|Play it up to this 1:25 and 1:25 area and if we 12 that's down to further in the 60 minute time frame you see right now.
NEUT23|But it is just one underneath this one or two.
NEUT24|A little bit about that one or two area.
NEUT25|So look for this thing to come in.
NEUT26|You don't get up.
NEUT27|Girl where do I pull back and not?
NEUT28|You know, trying to get the new here at the 106 scale fit pulls back and it bounced back up.
NEUT29|You could you know at once it break about this pivot then just you know, hope you stop down here.
NEUT30|OK, so that's when we sort and that's based on what I'm looking at.
NEUT31|And don't forget to smash that thumbs up to help me promote this video on YouTube and help me grow my channel.
NEUT32|Thank you for watching.
NEUT33|"Stay safe."""
