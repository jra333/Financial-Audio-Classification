BEAR0|"""Mumbai man has now said that vaccine stock in Mumbai is about to get over."
NEUT1|Let straight away go across to my colleague Caja Layer.
NEUT2|For more on this casual on one hand, while of course the focus is to vaccinate everyone who's eligible right now, vaccine shortage is emerging as another big concern.
NEUT3|I guess.
NEUT4|In fact, she said that while Co vaccine is being given in certain places, the doses of Kobe Shield which is given in more places was around one 1,76,000 by afternoon yesterday.
NEUT5|Which means that by now.
BEAR6|It has gone down even lesser, and the Corporation aims that around 50,000 vaccination doses be administered every day.
BEAR7|Which means that in the next three or four days the current stock of vaccines would actually get over for Mumbai and that is something that is not a right sign.
BEAR8|They say that the BMC has written to the center, so has the health Minister Rajesh to pay.
BEAR9|But so far the extra stock has not yet come and that's why they are staring at vaccine shortage, especially in Mumbai.
BULL10|"Alright, thank you very much Castle for the moment for joining us with all of those details."""
