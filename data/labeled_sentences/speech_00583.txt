NEUT0|"""Hey everyone, Steve here from the turtlefollower.com and in this video we're going to take a quick look at a trade in Adobe now."
NEUT1|If you guys have followed me for any length of time you know this is pretty much my go to setup so I want to just go over it real quick with everyone and point out what I think is a good setup that we have going on right now in Adobe.
NEUT2|So the first thing we always look for is a breakout from a weekly.
BEAR3|Any daily consolidation and you could see here that Adobe has been consolidating on the weekly chart.
NEUT4|We zoom that in a little bit.
NEUT5|You can see that that area is basically between 7972 and.
NEUT6|70 let's call it 73 so basically, between 80 and $73 Adobe's been consolidating.
BULL7|Could see it's starting now, recently to break out from that consolidation.
NEUT8|Now if we take that one step further and we look at the daily chart, you could also see another consolidation on the daily chart.
NEUT9|So here is basically the weekly consolidation.
NEUT10|This bigger area right?
NEUT11|In here.
NEUT12|This purple line.
NEUT13|And then.
NEUT14|You could see here that the.
BEAR15|Consolidation on the daily now is a little bit tighter.
BEAR16|It's basically between 8075 and 7766 and again breaking out from that consolidation so they're both breaking out along uptrends.
NEUT17|Alright, here's an uptrend on the daily and if we zoom out on the weekly.
NEUT18|You could see if I get the right tool you can see the breakout happening on.
NEUT19|The weekly chart.
NEUT20|OK, so here's a trendline along a weekly uptrend and a trendline along a daily uptrend and again breaking out from both.
BULL21|So this is a great go to set up for me.
NEUT22|I'm going to take an entry tomorrow at 8225 or whatever the open prices and set my stop right here at 7750.
NEUT23|That basically puts us with a break of the 50 day moving average and.
BULL24|Just above the trend line.
NEUT25|OK, so little aggressive on the stop.
NEUT26|I think that's probably more than enough to you know if if it were breakout breakdown below 7750.
BEAR27|I think that's more than enough to kind of cancel out the trade considering how long it's gone sideways.
NEUT28|But again, you know good looking trade here.
BULL29|Nice move.
NEUT30|The last three days so I wouldn't be surprised to see a pause or even pull back a little bit tomorrow.
NEUT31|But stop is essentially 7750, so that's the trade in Adobe again.
NEUT32|Dual breakout on the weekly and daily chart.
NEUT33|And they go to setup a mine, so any questions or comments please leave them below.
