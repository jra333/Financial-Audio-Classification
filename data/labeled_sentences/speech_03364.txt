BEAR0|"""This news to U.S. stock markets will start the day in a long awaited correction."
BEAR1|The Dow Jones industrials fell more than 1000 points yesterday.
BEAR2|For the second time in a week, the Dow had its biggest ever one day point decline on Monday.
BEAR3|The index is down more than 10% from an all time high of more than 26,002 weeks ago.
NEUT4|Kenneth Rogoff is a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund.
NEUT5|He's now a professor of economics and public policy at Harvard.
NEUT6|Good morning, I know you've said that what we call happening is a recalibration, not a catastrophe.
NEUT7|How would you explain this volatility?
NEUT8|Well, it's gone up really fast like gangbusters for awhile, so it's hard to get completely worked up about the fact it's gone partway down.
BULL9|Nobody quite knew I went up so far, but I think the news is good that global growth is very strong.
BULL10|US growth is strong, profits are strong, wages are up, but I think what investors are nervous about is interest rates might start going up and stocks have been the only game in town.
NEUT11|You put your money in bonds.
NEUT12|You got nothing and now some money will shift out.
NEUT13|Housing mortgages will be more expensive, so that's I think the fear in Washington.
NEUT14|This week there was another debate about spending Rand Paul kept them everybody there late last night talking about the debt and deficit.
BEAR15|Is there going to be any connection between that and these big numbers we're hearing and possible interest rates going up that might hurt the economy.
BEAR16|You know, it could come down the road so we could see pressure on the Federal Reserve not to raise interest rates because it's painful for the stock market.
BEAR17|It's painful for the US government so far, that's.
NEUT18|Not what's going on here.
NEUT19|I mean, let's face it, it's been sort of a circus in Washington for a year, and the stock market just goes up and up.
NEUT20|So to say that it's craziness in Washington that's driving the stock market down kind of hard case to make.
NEUT21|And I think it's really a good news story that.
NEUT22|But the fear that interest rates will go up and maybe stocks aren't the only game in town.
BEAR23|You say it's a good news story, but a lot of people can still are very worried and a little freaked out to use the technical term.
NEUT24|So what attributes do you think investors really need right now during this time?
BEAR25|So, so it's really hard around.
NEUT26|The stock market is when it's going up, you want to say I'm missing the boat.
NEUT27|I should work at my house.
NEUT28|I should put everything in and then when it's going down you go.
BEAR29|Oh my gosh, I've got to pull everything out and the small investor.
BEAR30|Most of us just get creamed by this.
BEAR31|It's hard to second guess, thanks if everyone knew the stock market was going down another 10% it would drop like a rock today.
NEUT32|But maybe it'll go back up so it's very hard advice to follow but to try to stay calm.
NEUT33|Sure, look at your portfolio, but maybe not right now in the middle of the storm.
BULL34|The same time you point out the fundamentals of the economy are good.
NEUT35|Corporate earnings are expected to be anywhere between 8:00 and 10% and continue all of that great.
NEUT36|What about in this is following on Johns questions that the government will have to borrow about a trillion dollars who's going to buy that debt?
NEUT37|What countries?
NEUT38|Well, for the moment everyone wants to buy U.S. debt.
NEUT39|The dollars King in a way it hasn't been since the 1950s.
BEAR40|Now that could turn if global interest rates go up and.
NEUT41|We don't really know why they've come solo.
BEAR42|It'll get painful.
NEUT43|Politicians will have to do stuff they don't seem very good at that, so it could go wrong, but it's probably not something that's happening overnight.
BULL44|Alright, thank you Ken.
NEUT45|Thank you.
NEUT46|You're so calm and steady.
NEUT47|I'd like to know when you start freaking out, Kenny.
NEUT48|Be there when that happens?
BULL49|Yeah, thank you very much.
BULL50|"Thank you."""
