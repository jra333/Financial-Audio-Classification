BULL0|"""It is the dawn of a new era at Disney."
NEUT1|That's what Goldman Sachs is saying today that firm reinstated coverage of the stock.
NEUT2|A buy rating $142, is the price target.
NEUT3|Pete Najarian I go to you Fox acquisition.
NEUT4|They like it Disney.
BULL5|Plus they like it under appreciated growth in Disney core parts.
BULL6|They like it and I would agree with all of those.
NEUT7|I would still say there's a very difficult there.
NEUT8|They still have to climb to get up there in the world of the Netflix and all the competition that's out there, Scott.
NEUT9|But the synergies that are brought in are there and they're talking about this particular analysts talking about.
BULL10|$2 billion worth of synergies.
NEUT11|So the acquisition, I think they they had to get more content.
NEUT12|They've got that.
BULL13|I think Disney is doing everything in the right way.
BEAR14|I think they're late.
NEUT15|Like I've said, I love the CEO.
NEUT16|I think he's going to magnificent job, except for the fact that he's been very late to the streaming world.
BULL17|Is the 2nd upgrade in a couple of weeks.
NEUT18|Remember the other one was by with 150, so this is a buy with 142.
NEUT19|We used to own Disney.
NEUT20|We don't anymore.
NEUT21|We sold it in 2016 and we look at it right now is something that one day we'd love to get back into, but now is not the time.
BEAR22|There's pretty much no earnings growth in 2019.
NEUT23|Only 4% earnings growth in 2020 is trading at a market multiple.
NEUT24|Dealing with this Fox merger is going to be huge, and there will be a lot of execution risks.
BULL25|So for us to get back in, we need to see growth reaccelerate.
NEUT26|And we're not there and they didn't get the big pop out of Dumble.
NEUT27|On top of everything else.
BULL28|I mean, it's a great.
BULL29|It might be a great.
NEUT30|Tim Burton flick but it didn't get the kind of numbers that they were hoping about.
NEUT31|What Jenny said.
NEUT32|Well, I think there's a lot to digest.
NEUT33|There's no doubt about it.
NEUT34|They made all this here.
NEUT35|I mean, they made a monstrous decision to make those assets work for them, right?
NEUT36|So it will take time, and because of that, I think I think though the mark, this stock has been basically sitting for a long period of time, right?
NEUT37|So I think there are creative ways where you've got the dividend yield side of it as well, and you could sell calls against it and you can create something there.
NEUT38|"Scott, while you're sitting in waiting for Disney to move."""
