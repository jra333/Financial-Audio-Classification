BEAR2|You can see the Dow continued to stay above the T line.
NEUT3|Continuing the uptrend, but more importantly.
BULL4|The NASDAQ they had been in this wedge formation did a best friend signal yesterday.
BULL5|And then today they gapped it up not only above the wedge, but at the 50 and traded higher.
BULL6|This is extremely strong.
BULL7|Bullish indication that we're going to start trading higher from here.
BEAR8|So as long as the indexes continue to trade above the key line, you stay long and the fact that the NASDAQ is now broken out of this trading range.
NEUT9|Prime or upside.
BULL10|This has made a couple of sectors very strong.
BULL11|The electric vehicle sector is now coming back.
BULL12|I. Quantum scape on some good news about their getting new financing from Volkswagen.
BULL13|Popped up pretty strong even though it traded lower from where it opened.
NEUT14|You can see that it based here.

NEUT18|Look at the doji sandwich, Jan lithium.
BULL19|Implies there's going to be more upside.
BULL20|And the gold stocks started coming back today.
BULL21|AG was a good sign of a Morningstar signal gap up.
BULL22|Look for more upside and in the gold stocks, especially now that it's kind of broken this down trend.
BULL23|So as long as the NASDAQ is continuing to trade up as strong as it is, remember.
BULL24|Last month when it was trading in this direction, the Dow was heading up.
NEUT25|Then it went sideways, with the Dow heading up.
NEUT26|Now they've turned it around.
BULL27|Even the big stocks like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Navid, IEA are all getting bullish sentiment.
NEUT28|So this is a short session right before a three day weekend because it can never tell what's going to happen over a three day weekend.
