BULL0|"""Welcome back traders to another video today."
NEUT1|I'm looking at Google, Google or on the four hour 180 day chart is always going back to the beginning of the year before the virus hit.
NEUT2|It was around 15115.
NEUT3|Twenty pulled back.
BULL4|All the way to 1008 dollars, it's 33%.
BEAR5|Drop this that's massive guys.
BULL6|Google was a little bit slower, you know, especially for the big cap, big name tech stocks to recover.
NEUT7|They might have been a little extended before the virus hit, but either way back you know into into July there were starting to get up to 14 fifty 1500 again.
BULL8|Establishing support there.
NEUT9|You know we have this growth channel is everybody.
NEUT10|Every other stock has going back to the recovery and Google just like every other stock has spent most of the recovery well above that Channel.
NEUT11|Only recently coming back into it.
BULL12|As we've seen on other charts from highs from earlier in the summer.
BULL13|And they also establish this more recent growth trend line, which is good to see.
BEAR14|But I mean main thing that sticks out here is is Google may have lagged the line lag behind a little bit in the beginning of the pandemic.
BEAR15|Recovery lagged behind a little bit throughout the summer, but more recently, you know from these most recent highs like we've seen in other names, they pulled back.
BEAR16|They pulled back into the bottom of the channel into previous support.
BULL17|Into highs established in the beginning of this summer and you know, Google's already bounced off of that in the back above the growth channel here and now.
BULL18|It's honestly starting to get a little bit extended again here, so I wouldn't be surprised to see some profit taking come this week.
NEUT19|See this thing.
NEUT20|Maybe pull back to the top of the trend.
BULL21|But a very very bullish chart probably needs to consolidate again back into the trend right now.
BULL22|But bullish on Google.
NEUT23|Through through the end of the year, as along with the other tech names.
BULL24|As long as we have a stimulus, I think we can expect another resurgence in tech.
NEUT25|I like to see Google come back into the channel here and then maybe look to take it.
NEUT26|Take it long, but that's Google guys.
BULL27|Thanks for watching.
