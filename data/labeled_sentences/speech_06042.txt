BULL0|"""So things are looking up for some now grows there's some interesting events have happened over the past couple of days."
BEAR1|It may lead to the potential skyrocketing of this dog anyway.
NEUT2|Hello, welcome back to crazier stunts.
BULL3|I'm your host crazy and I hope you've been having a wonderful day so far.
NEUT4|And if you're new around here, welcome.
NEUT5|If you're returning member.
BULL6|Hey, welcome back, highly appreciated those new guys around here.
NEUT7|You go down there and hit that nice beautiful red button and hit the bells, welches and keep up to date with daily stock market videos.
NEUT8|Anyway, let's move on to the topic.
NEUT9|Well, anyway today we're talking about Sunday grows, which is basically a company that is based on the.
NEUT10|Growth of a certain green herb that we can't say on YouTube for many different reasons and at this current time the government in USA is trying to push the legalization of this green herb which looks like to be a pretty good thing coming up soon.
BULL11|Anyway, we've got some amazing news when it comes to our potential ability for sundial growers and the ability that for it to skyrocket up in the future as well as the potential ability for this to help other green herb based companies in the stock market as well.
NEUT12|Essentially this big thing that is currently happening that will help benefit this stock is the fact that the Senate.
NEUT13|And the Democrats out the Senate are trying to push to have this beautiful green hub legalized before the end of 2021, which in an oil base is a pretty incredible thing to think about.
NEUT14|The fact that this green herb that has been pretty much sending people to jail over such little things for the longest time, that is less deadly than the *** **** tobacco that easily can buy on the streets and on in shops and all that.
BULL15|Looks like it's finally able to become legalized, potentially by the end of this year.
NEUT16|Which means to those stock buying people out there, all those investors or the people who want to make a quick load of cash, or.
NEUT17|Tires fan of a year or two.
NEUT18|This would be the time that I would be purchasing shares in sundial growers.
NEUT19|If you hadn't already, now of course I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT20|Have to make that clear so I don't get in too much crap from the government, but essentially right now would be the best time to get in on some nail grows.
NEUT21|It's going to be a long haul and think that definitely made clear is this is going to be a long haul.
NEUT22|So if you got in on the massive stocks hike that happened around AMC and GameStop as well around the Wall Street.
BEAR23|Bad stuff that happened a few weeks Max is essentially going to be really weird to you because those stocks.
NEUT24|You were in and out within a matter of like a week.
NEUT25|This one is going to be one of those type of stocks that you're going to want to hold for awhile, mainly due to the fact that we have no complete idea when this law is going to get past.
NEUT26|That will help legalize the green herb, but trust me when I say this.
NEUT27|If all goes good, it's going to be very beneficial to you, but again, I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT28|Make sure that's clear and you understand that I would still go off and get either financial expert and advisor to help you out on making a decision on this.
NEUT29|Or go do some research on your own, but either way I do see some potential skyrocket.
BULL30|Potential ability coming along with this stock over the next year or so if not even longer than that.
NEUT31|If you're willing to just hold, hold and hold until the absolute P anyhow, let me know now in the comments.
NEUT32|How do you see the potential ability of this stock skyrocketing in the future?
NEUT33|Do you believe the government will have this entire thing sword and will have it legalized before the end of 2021?
NEUT34|Or do you think something is gonna go wrong along the way?
NEUT35|Either way, let me know now below and if you did enjoy, make sure to smash that like button if you haven't already.
NEUT36|Make sure to subscribe for daily stock content and I'll see you guys a little later today.
NEUT37|"Goodbye."""
