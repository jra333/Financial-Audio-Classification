NEUT0|"""Now when you look at this, did you start by saying to your partners?"
NEUT1|You know what put there's a lot of stuff for sale.
NEUT2|We gotta do something.
NEUT3|Or is it something totally different?
NEUT4|Which is, you know what?
BULL5|I've got some great ideas and if we had some money in ASPAC, we could execute.
NEUT6|It's the second one I didn't.
NEUT7|I'm not smart enough to know what market will be in six months, 12 months, 18 months from now.
NEUT8|And frankly, I wasn't smart enough to know what market would be in a week after we did the off the public offering.
NEUT9|I'm smart enough to know about businesses that we can understand, and I'm smart enough along with my partners and other investors to know what kind of company should make a good public company.
NEUT10|And so with those ideas and having a pretty good understanding of the sectors were looking at, I thought it was worth a bet on myself and a bet on John Collins and a bet on Christian way and those two fellows also wanted to bet on themselves and one another.
BULL11|And when it went, hedge fund manager of great success with the Tiger Cub and the other obviously has tremendous experience.
NEUT12|Alright, so when this question I've been to football games with you all the times, you always say the same thing.
NEUT13|Which is that this is the only game I can see.
NEUT14|I've gotta work here.
NEUT15|I have to work.
NEUT16|I have to work in your time at the NFL.
NEUT17|Did you see some things that could be really interesting to develop yourself?
NEUT18|But now you're starting to put pen to paper on.
NEUT19|Absolutely, and in fact on location you call it Ole look the the.
NEUT20|If you look at sports and entertainment it has had a tremendous amount of private capital and it has had private equity capital associated with it.
NEUT21|But in a lot of the sectors it's had tremendous creativity entrepreneurs founders, but it hasn't had a tremendous amount of public capital associated with it.
NEUT22|And so yeah, there are ideas.
NEUT23|It doesn't mean I'm smarter.
NEUT24|Then people who are at leagues or at teams, it just means that I'm bringing a capital markets perspective to it and I'm someone they have talked to before.
NEUT25|So if it feels when someone is trying to sell an IPO to a League or two, an owner may feel like they're trying to sell something to them.
NEUT26|And I I'm.
NEUT27|I'm of the view that that's not what it will feel like.
NEUT28|That we can have a conversation based on them understanding me and I understand them as does John Collins and.
NEUT29|And so if we're trying to solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity, and they have the problem and they have the opportunity, then inspect this becomes a tool at.
NEUT30|And by the way, it's a really useful tool because you can do a lot of things with this pack that you can't do with an IPO, so this is not better than an IPO, it's just different.
BULL31|And so with that kind of flexibility, my hunch is that we can find some things that will work out.
