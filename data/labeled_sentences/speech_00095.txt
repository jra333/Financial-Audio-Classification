BEAR1|I can't even keep up with this yo.

NEUT6|Let's talk about Nokia guys.
BEAR7|Alright so Nokia has been kind of going through some mood swings.
NEUT8|OK, it's pretty obvious that Nokia is a pretty hot stock right now.
NEUT9|Getting sold off, bought and sold off, bought and sold off Button.
NEUT10|You get it.
BULL11|I suspect we're going to see a pretty big run up in a major comeback from Nokia within the next couple of days.
BULL12|I see Nokia being $10 before the end of March, so we saw Nokia hit $5 again a couple days ago, which was really nice.
NEUT13|I think that happened on February 1st actually.
BEAR14|And then Nokia kind of disappointed me today or.
NEUT15|Yesterday, sorry whenever it hit four like 420 or something for 4:10 and then Nokia really surprised me today by hitting 470.
BEAR16|So you can really tell that Nokia is going through some mood swings recently.
NEUT17|Now it's not to say that that's a bad thing.
NEUT18|That is not really a bad thing at all actually.
NEUT19|And it's honestly a fine thing.
NEUT20|Majority of stocks in the stock market will go through a lot of mood swings, but Nokia is something that I am very bullish on so it really does **** to see it not go straight to the moon.
BEAR21|Now, with that being said, all of the hottest stocks on the market right now are going through crazy mood swings.
NEUT22|Some people are day trading it, selling off the same day that will add on to the mood swings.
BEAR23|Some people are betting on Nokia in AMC and all these other companies to fail.
NEUT24|That adds to the mood swings and there's people like me and you that are buying into Nokia and holding until it hits 10, fifteen, $20.00.
NEUT25|So where do I think Nokia will land tomorrow?
BULL26|I think Nokia will land at a nice five dollars 5:50 we're going to have to wait and see but I definitely see Nokia hitting the highs.
NEUT27|Of seven to $8.00 before the end of this month and hitting 10 to $15 by the end of next month.
NEUT28|But I may be calling it a little too early, but I see Nokia doing some pretty big numbers here soon, but hey, that's just my opinion an I am not a financial advisor, so please do not take any of my advice without assessing a financial advisor or doing your own research first.
NEUT29|But with that being said, I would love to know what you guys think about Nokia in the comment section below.
NEUT30|You guys saying that Nokia is going to explode.
