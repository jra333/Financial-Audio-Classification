NEUT0|"""So there is an element where compared over now."
NEUT1|In this video I'm going to share the complete technical analysis of happiest minds talk and it will be in position reading as well as those who invested in the stock.
NEUT2|You must watch this video to know what's happening in the stuff and what is the future view.
NEUT3|Here I'm using daily time frame to explain stuff to honor breaking the help of support and resistance lines as well as trendlines.
NEUT4|If you want to learn something, watch this video.
NEUT5|Here.
NEUT6|At first I'm going to another train line here.
NEUT7|So this is the trendline the stock is.
NEUT8|Facing right from the.
NEUT9|Launching of the IP will see.
NEUT10|So the first level operations tendencies are 381 and then level 366, then level 353 acting guys are titrations for this talk, and this level that is the level.
BULL11|3 N 6 acting as a strong support for the stock recently on a daily timeframe, the Stunkard reversed in this range from.
BEAR12|310 it got reverse from the level, so currently the stock is trading near the level 318.9 K and it is facing the residence level near 323.
BULL13|Once this 323 level crosses on a direct imprint, we can expect the stock to zoom.
NEUT14|Still wear till here till this level 331.
BULL15|Three thirty available crossers we can expect the stock to rally till level 341.
NEUT16|Three forty level breaks.
BULL17|It is expected to touch this trendline resistance level.
NEUT18|Once this trend.
NEUT19|Analysis level.
NEUT20|Broken on our daily temperature, we can expect the stock rotors the next implantable.
NEUT21|That IS 353 then 370, then level 380.
BEAR22|So after that we can expect the new setup rally in this talk but at current price or creating a point 318.9 per price the stock is facing near the level 323 acting as a resistance level.
NEUT23|So we should wait for the patience.
BULL24|Level 3 Two 323 to break because we just got a nice support near the level 310.
NEUT25|Once this 323 breaks, we can expect the stock to go on a uptrend basis, as you can see here.
BULL26|See a threat and only it has gotta support on 28th of October and it made a high near the level 353.
NEUT27|But it pays the trendline resistance level here and that's why it got reversed.
BULL28|And now it is good supporting 310.
NEUT29|So it is able to touch this trend lineage since level every day that end in races level changes.
NEUT30|So I request you to.
NEUT31|Rewind this video and watch how to.
NEUT32|How did I add this trend line here so it's very simple and once this tendon breaks we can expect the stock to rally like anything.
