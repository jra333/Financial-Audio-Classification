NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, the downward pressure on Apple continues an A lot of bearishness involved right now.
BEAR5|Now from the big picture point of view, is the entire chart destroyed?
NEUT6|Absolutely not.
BEAR7|You can see that the you know the price is still in an overall uptrend.
BULL8|But yeah, there's also no doubt about it that this pullback right now has been pretty significant.
BEAR9|So there is a lot of downwards momentum and pressure that is showing up in the level now to watch very closely.
NEUT10|Anne.
NEUT11|I believe it's already been tested today.
NEUT12|Yeah, is this former area of resistance right here?
NEUT13|Breakout point at the 1:30 mark.
NEUT14|So 1:30 is important because if the actually let me just map out where the next level of support would be.
NEUT15|And that next level of support would be the bottom of these loads down here at 127.
NEUT16|So 130 though is important because if the price were to come back down here and then breakdown through it.
NEUT17|As you can see here, it just pretty much puts the chart into no man's land until down there at 127.
NEUT18|Now does that mean that if 1:30 is broken then it's guaranteed for sure?
BEAR19|Going down in 127?
NEUT20|No, of course not.
NEUT21|There's no such thing as a guarantee, but just from the technical point of view, there just aren't any other areas of support that imply that the price could bounce.
NEUT22|So I don't think it would surprise anybody if the price did breakthrough 1:30.
NEUT23|And then eventually drifted its way down to that 127 mark.
NEUT24|So you know, that's why that 130 mark.
NEUT25|Good to see that it held here, but you're going to have a whole lot of eyeballs watching that level, and rightfully so, because we got to see if the price can say above that area, or if it's going to continue on down, you know, through that.
NEUT26|Next, you know, general area, so keeping those couple areas from the support side of things as far as resistance is in the very near term that first key level of resistance is going to be that pink line there, which on my charger notes the very well known 200.
NEUT27|Moving average current value of that $134.
BULL28|If the price can push up through 134.
NEUT29|Next, key level after that right up there around that one 3525 ish area.
NEUT30|So keep around those couple of technical areas from the resistance out of things.
NEUT31|But All in all yeah no doubt about it.
NEUT32|The Bears have made themselves present here and we have to see what next week as the offering play out.
NEUT33|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT34|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL36|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT42|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT43|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT44|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
