NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, crypto Mentor 99."
NEUT1|How you doing?
NEUT2|It is January the 30th, 2021 lunchtime doing a few videos.
NEUT3|Remember how I say that my dad would say?
NEUT4|Cryptomator 99 some people just like to hear themselves talk.
NEUT5|I don't think I'm like that when I've got something to say I'll say it I'm saying it today yesterday.
NEUT6|If you missed it, I did a video buckle up, buttercup, part three.
NEUT7|That'll be video number one below.
NEUT8|Video #2 below is going to be on XRP Ave and LRC.
NEUT9|Video #3 below VGX and DNT this is going to be my stock trade of AMC.
NEUT10|Uhm?
NEUT11|I think I first saw.
NEUT12|AMC was it Wednesday or Thursday.
NEUT13|I did a video but I forget which day it was.
NEUT14|And I had no idea what was going on with the market manipulation and the shorts and.
NEUT15|Was it GameStop was at the one that everybody was yelling about and then Robin Hood basically locked everybody out.
NEUT16|I had no idea about any of this so I'm trading AMC made a little bit when I got back into it Thursday after the market closed.
NEUT17|And I got in.
NEUT18|I'm at $12.70.
NEUT19|And for those of you that know, I'd like to make one and a half, maybe 2% per trade get out, not get greedy.
NEUT20|So it opened it about 15 bucks or so.
NEUT21|Those are 15 thirty $15.30.
NEUT22|Mike, I'm gonna let this thing right out so I get.
NEUT23|I could have sold a 13.
NEUT24|I didn't.
NEUT25|I could have sold it 14 I could have sold it 1550 during the day I didn't.
NEUT26|Then I finally got to a point in the afternoon yesterday.
NEUT27|I'm like I'm just going to hold on to this thing till next week till the 1st week of February, 'cause there's supposed to be some major.
NEUT28|Theoretically.
NEUT29|Short squeeze that's going to.
NEUT30|Make this thing go up to 5075.
NEUT31|A $100 depending on who you listen to.
NEUT32|So I'm just a little bit curious.
NEUT33|But yeah, I got in Thursday night after hours $12.70.
NEUT34|I'll let you know.
NEUT35|Some.
NEUT36|How it goes when I trade it, but again, Thursday after hours got in, I think it closed at like 8.
NEUT37|$58.50 I was going to buy a 10 after hours after the market closed and I didn't find like heck it's going up to 13 so I jumped in at 1270.
NEUT38|Anyhow, I'll let you know how that trade goes but.
NEUT39|Yeah, Crypto Mentor 99.
NEUT40|Take a look at the videos below.
BULL41|And yeah love y'all.
NEUT42|"Bye bye."""
