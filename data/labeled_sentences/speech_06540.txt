NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and thank you for joining this technical analysis video for Friday, July 10th in the pound yen market."
BEAR1|Here the exam.com so zooming into the daily chart we can see that pound yen managed to reach three week high at 135.90 on Thursday, but its gains proved to be a temporary with the daily price action taking the form of a bearish shooting star candle stick which is a warning that a downside correction may be on the way.
BULL2|Other 50% hibachi of the applet from 147.94.
BEAR3|224 is also near yesterday's highs and if we look at the stochastic so this is another negative warning since the indicator has started to slow down words after picking above its 80 oversold mark.
BULL4|So incase selling pressure strengthens we could look for immediate support around the ascending trendline stretch from March lows and the 38.2% Fibonacci 133.15 breaking that level not far below the previous law of 131.74 may add some.
BEAR5|Are footing saving the 3 month old positive pattern and stopping the seller from reaching Villa.
BULL6|23.6% in March of 129.65 now in case of an upside reversal.
BULL7|We should we would like to see a breakup of the 50% even after 135.97 and a rally towards the descending trend line if we bridge that line and more importantly close above the 61.8% if one out of 138.80, then the next resistance may appear around 140 point.
BULL8|85 While if we look at the bigger picture, we may need a steeper increase above 144.94 to resume hopes of an uptrending market, so that's all for me.
NEUT9|Thank you for watching.
BULL10|"Have a great day."""
