NEUT0|"""It's clean this video chart on ticker symbol MSFT Microsoft."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here.
BULL5|The volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT6|Got that news about the contract.
NEUT7|So more of the story.
NEUT8|A lot of people are going to be watching this one moving forward next week.
NEUT9|Remember, the markets are closed on Friday for Good Friday, so let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
BULL10|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level musically would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say appear above $240.
NEUT11|Now.
BEAR12|Don't get me wrong, the price falls below 240.
NEUT13|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
NEUT14|We have the price.
BULL15|Could manage this to stay above that level.
BULL16|That would certainly be a very impressive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT17|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT18|That is with the Purple Line there comes into play the 50.
NEUT19|Simple moving average keyword certainly been moving.
NEUT20|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and get more and more relevant, which is helpful because when it comes just gauging the overall health of the move, that right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT21|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health Bozeman.
NEUT22|Full control over most visualize that that is what is being presented against and above 240 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of levels of resistance.
NEUT23|Gotta squeeze down the charter quite a bit to go into the past history.
NEUT24|Next.
NEUT25|Key battleground to watch very closely.
NEUT26|Going to be right up there at $244 and then after 244 next key level after that right up there around 246 oh 240-4246.
NEUT27|Next couple of key battleground to watch moving forward, but All in all.
BULL28|Very impressive movement and now it's just a question of can the price continue to build upon it moving forward?
NEUT29|And let's see what happens.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.

NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL34|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
