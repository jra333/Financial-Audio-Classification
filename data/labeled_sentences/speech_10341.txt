NEUT0|"""I want you to think of royalty."
NEUT1|Pharma is a healthcare hedge fund that invests in the development of individual drugs.
BULL2|One that's got a phenomenal track record.
NEUT3|This is the kind of stock that works in good times and bad, which is why it exploded higher right out of the gate.
BULL4|Book runners had to increase the size of the deal by about 10% because there was so much demand.
BULL5|Even then, Rowly farmer price to 28 bucks.
NEUT6|The height of the range for shooting up to 4450 by yesterday's close and tag you in another 9% today deserving.
NEUT7|I wish I told you to get a piece of this, but.
NEUT8|I probably would've gotten anyway.
NEUT9|I think the story is so compelling that it's worth putting on a small position even up here.
NEUT10|Then if the stock cools off, you can back up the truck and buy more.
NEUT11|What makes me say this?
NEUT12|Well, because Papa la Garrette explain yesterday we're in a Golden age of medical research.
NEUT13|This is an industry that plows through $300 billion a year and a third of that from governments and nonprofits.
NEUT14|The rest from business Royal.
NEUT15|Why don't you listen to this?
NEUT16|This tells you how they do their thing.
NEUT17|When we started to do is to fund research and that of products in the hands of the biotech companies, this incredibly nimble intrapreneurial companies that have gotten funded by venture capital firms and, you know, use that money to fund the early stage of the trials phase one, phase two.
NEUT18|When these drugs get to phase three, a lot more capital is required and at that moment we come in.
BULL19|That is a brilliant strategy.
NEUT20|Come in when the drugs have proven themselves, but there's still woman were incredibly expensive.
NEUT21|Hurdle phase three and the developers need cash to make the jump because only huge pharma can get past this stage along.
NEUT22|You gotta recruit all these people for trial and that's a gigantic amount of capital with a company like this, though, you're betting on management's ability to pick winners when you look at Royalty Pharma's portfolio, they clearly have the Midas touch.
NEUT23|This company is a stake in 22 different billion dollar drugs.
NEUT24|Including seven drugs with over 3 billion in sales and believe me they spotted him ahead of time.
NEUT25|Now I've been recommending for since Vertex for ages because of its incredible cystic fibrosis franchise.
NEUT26|Well, Royalty Pharma owns a piece of that franchise.
BEAR27|They're getting a cut of Biogen's multiple sclerosis franchise.
NEUT28|How about Abby's big blood cancer, drug anguillians prophylactic for HIV, have oncology, diabetes, pain management, migraines quoting the new migraine drug from Cramer, fate Biohaven.
NEUT29|I bet you Bio Haven gets a bid.
BULL30|This thing is so good.
NEUT31|It even tastes good.
NEUT32|Don't worry, I'm the chief spokesperson for the American Migraine Foundation.
NEUT33|I can say stuff like that and put it all together.
NEUT34|An royalty farmers seems like the perfect way to play biotech with the same sort of upside that comes from speculating, these smaller plays players, but less risk because the portfolios diversified across the entire industry.
NEUT35|It's a lot better than some stupid brain dead ETF that was put together, fleeced you with big fees.
NEUT36|Again, it's like a hedge fund that invests in individual drugs, a hedge fund with the perfect 25 year long track record.
NEUT37|As their older drugs go up at in their room and start making money, I I asked about that like Bio ban, the biohaven approved migraine treatment enertech.
NEUT38|Don't miss a second of mad money.
