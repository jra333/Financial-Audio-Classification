BEAR0|"""Alright, what's going on?"
BULL1|Ladies and gentlemen, it's good to be back here with another video.
NEUT2|And today, let's talk about Netflix real quick.
NEUT3|However, before we do that, make sure you subscribe and like this video.

NEUT6|Alright, so let's talk about Netflix.
BEAR7|I really think that Netflix is a stock that is going to go down a little bit.
BULL8|Let me tell you why we've seen it increase throughout these past few months at incredible rates.
BULL9|Look at this the one year chart is up 17%.
NEUT10|The five year chart is just astronomical 370%, but when we zoom in.
NEUT11|We can see how whenever everything started go down.
BULL12|Netflix did a little too, but its rebound was very quick.
BULL13|It came back up within a month and then it continued to hit new highs of $455.19 and that was sitting around $417.00.
NEUT14|I do think that if we even look at the five year chart we see that is following this base of trajectory line, but it's came up and down, up and down up and not down yet and I think it's going to come down again.
BEAR15|The reason I say that is because more people are not staying inside now.
BEAR16|The stay at home orders are being lifted in a lot of States and people are going to be outside.
NEUT17|Also keep in mind that a lot of people have been inside for the past few months.
NEUT18|They're going to try and be outside as much as they can, and that means that Netflix is not going to be used as much.
NEUT19|So I do think that this stock is going to come down in a good buying point would be around a 370 mark.
NEUT20|It is up there a little bit, but if we look at the one week chart we can see how it's coming down to one month chart.
BEAR21|Also coming down and the one day chart is up a little, but again the downward trajectory is in the weekend of months.
BULL22|So I do think that with everything going around right now within the next few months, Netflix should come around a 370 to 380 mark.
NEUT23|Also, just do your own research, look at what's going on, do your own research on the fair value according to even morning starts only 160, but the stocks up here, so keep in mind that whatever the stock prices is not reflective of the company at the end of the day, right?
NEUT24|We're saying Chipotle hit over $1000 when I really don't think Chipotle is $1000 stock.
NEUT25|Come on, let's be honest here, but.
NEUT26|Do your own research.
NEUT27|Let me know what you guys think and I'll see you in the next one.
NEUT28|"Take care."""
