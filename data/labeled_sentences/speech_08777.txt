NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume and well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So definitely a great way to start the week and certainly a lot of updates that need to be made.
BULL6|So when the first updates is just one of those areas of support and this is what I would call the ideal weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that would be the price can stay up there above 122.
NEUT7|Now don't get me wrong if the price falls below 122.
BULL8|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage a step above that level that would certainly be a fantastic sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT9|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT10|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT11|The 50.
NEUT12|Simple moving average keyword definitely being moving 'cause I get at the price is way up here.
NEUT13|This line is way down there, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful and beneficial because when it comes just gauging the health of the overall move, that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT14|Just watch a purple line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT15|Her best visualize that that is what has been represented again.
BULL16|Yeah, staying above 122 would be great.
NEUT17|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistant resistance are concerned.
NEUT18|Not to squeeze down the charter quite a bit.
NEUT19|And go back into the charts.
NEUT20|History next, key big battleground to watch moving forward, which every breakout player in their brothers Uncle is going to be watching.
NEUT21|Is this area right here at one 2715 so one 2715?
BULL22|Like I said, very well defined area of resistance watch.
NEUT23|So a lot of breakout players will be concerned about that and then next level after that right up there around 1:32.
NEUT24|But All in all fantastic way to start off the week and maybe that is the best news of everything is that it's only Monday, still four days left on the week.
NEUT25|So let's see how things continue to play out.
NEUT26|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT27|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT32|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT36|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
