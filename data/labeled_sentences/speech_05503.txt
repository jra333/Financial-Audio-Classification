NEUT1|Palantir's valuation.
BULL2|Alright, let's get started with the combination of steady growth rates in 2021 combined with a multiple expansion.
BULL3|Assuming that Palantir grows its revenues in 2021 by 35%, this means its revenues could reach $1.4 billion.
NEUT4|Putting the stock trading for 36 X its forward revenues.
NEUT5|I don't think that's an expensive multiple for a size stock.
BEAR6|Particularly one which we have already seen is eyeing up non GAPPS profits this year already with customers locked in for 3.6 years.
NEUT7|Let's compare Palantir with another big data Pier, Splunk, which shareholders frequently boast of its very long term average contracts.
BEAR8|As you can see, Splunk's average contract in fiscal Q2 2021 last quarter was less than 2.4 years.
BEAR9|Also, splunk's revenue growth rates are significantly slower than Palantir's that just approximately 22% in 2021 after it completes its migration of customers from on premise towards cloud.
BULL10|Nonetheless, Splunk is already priced at $25 billion market cap.
BEAR11|Despite lackluster growth rates much lower non GAPPS gross profit margins of 78.4% and non GAA P operating losses of negative 13%.
NEUT12|Anyway, I compare Splunk with Palantir.
BULL13|Palantir is a much better investment yet both companies trade at very similar market caps.
BULL14|The bottom line, Palantir is an expertly managed company within a star roster for its management.
BULL15|Even though the market is unsure about its potential, I see a very compelling investment opportunity here.
BULL16|Investors are being asked to pay 36 X forward sales for a company that is already non GAPPS profitable with 35% revenue growth rates into next year and minimal need for cap ex.
BULL17|This is investment is worthwhile considering that's what's been happening this week in the world of Palantir.
