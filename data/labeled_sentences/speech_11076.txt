NEUT1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions first stop for NIO.
BULL2|Is Norway alright?
NEUT3|Let's get started the first stop for NIO to enter the European overseas markets could be Norway.
BULL4|Anio is expanding to Norway due to its 50% electric vehicle sales.
NEUT5|This speculation is based William Lieben founder, Chairman and CEO of NIO, who said in an interview that the center screen navigation map shown at the launch of its first sedan, ET7.
NEUT6|Revealed the information of entering overseas markets when the address was shown.
NEUT7|It was Karl Johans Gate in Oslo, Norway, and other evidence that Nio may enter Norway first is the job advertisement posted on LinkedIn, which shows that the company is already hiring locally for a large number of positions, including delivery specialists.
BULL8|It wouldn't be surprising if Nio chose to enter the Norwegian market first with a record 54.3% of electric vehicle sales in 2020, despite the COVID-19 causing delays in the release of several new models.
BULL9|That is an increase of 42.4% in 2019 and up from 1% a decade ago, making Norway the first country in the world where more than 50% of annual vehicle sales are electric.
NEUT10|The high penetration of electric vehicles is also a fact that Lee constantly mentions when talking to the media.
NEUT11|Lee said that Nio's entry into overseas markets will start with Europe first, which is because there is a consensus in Europe on the importance of electric vehicles and Environmental Protection.
BULL12|The proportion of electric vehicle sales in Europe grows very fast last year, with Norway exceeding 50%.
BULL13|Which is very good.
BULL14|Lee also said that many of the automotive regulations in China and Europe are close and the European user and policy environment is more friendly to electric vehicles.
BULL15|Adding that the signing of the China Europe Investment Agreement also allows Chinese companies to have a more friendly environment when entering Europe.
