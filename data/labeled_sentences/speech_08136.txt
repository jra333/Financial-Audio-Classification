NEUT0|"""I thought I'd start though with what in my old life in television we used to call a dumb viewer question never well, and I'm happy to play dumb viewer here."
NEUT1|If you know a consumer even.
NEUT2|More than just a casual consumer of news and current affairs from the region, we pay attention to see is really nothing but well, not nothing but sees a tremendous amount of uncertainty, and that's obviously manifesting itself most.
NEUT3|Blatantly, I guess at the moment with not just the Korean Peninsula but the potential for spillover even if there isn't a conflict.
NEUT4|You know, we always hear that uncertainty is is the is the worst thing for investors and markets and the like and that has you know that situation has a Japan problem.
NEUT5|Huge China problem potentially and then I don't.
NEUT6|I won't enumerate all the other issues in Flashpoints in hotspots around the area.
NEUT7|But Flipside is all those metrics and numbers and World Bank reports and markets and everything else.
NEUT8|And you'd never think that.
NEUT9|Yeah, things were in play, so my dumb viewer question is what's going on here?
NEUT10|Well, that's the $35 million question.
NEUT11|It is also not a dumb the dumb viewer questions are never done.
NEUT12|For starters, the dumb questions are always the best questions.
NEUT13|But no.
NEUT14|I mean this is something that a lot of us that watch the markets have been fascinated by puzzling over for years.
BEAR15|Now there is a tremendous amount of political risk out there.
NEUT16|I mean, you can point, you know just the obvious issues of Korea, China, the US.
NEUT17|I mean there there are 100 more you could name Venezuela, Morocco.
NEUT18|I mean you know any number of other countries are having big economic and political issues.
NEUT19|Almost wherever you look in the globe.
NEUT20|But the markets are not reacting and I actually think there's a very clear reason for this.
NEUT21|Political events are not liquid, they are one offs.
NEUT22|They're things that the markets have no way to understand or price a lot of big hedge fund guys, Ray Dalio.
NEUT23|Some other folks have been writing about populism trying to understand it.
BEAR24|Some people have actually been rejiggering there.
NEUT25|Portfolios to try and hedge against the risk of extreme politics.
NEUT26|Interesting Lee Ray Dalio, who runs Bridgewater, put out a note saying that he was moving some of his portfolio away from US based political risks.
NEUT27|So it's you know it's not so much Korea necessarily that people are trying to hedge against but just the partisan populism that we've seen in so many developed developed countries.
NEUT28|So that's point number one point, #2.
NEUT29|What are the markets reacting to?
NEUT30|Why are they at record highs?
NEUT31|Still, they're reacting to.
NEUT32|The actions of the global central bankers of the world in the last 10 years.
NEUT33|So if you look at the amount of money that the Fed has poured in $4 trillion in the last decade into the markets globally, central bankers have put in $30 trillion.
BEAR34|That is totally unprecedented, and it naturally inflates the markets and naturally pushes people into stocks and riskier assets.
NEUT35|That's what it was supposed to do.
BULL36|You know, I would argue that we have really reached levels.
BEAR37|Where that asset bubble has become a risk in and of itself, and we can maybe talk more about how that might play out globally and in Asia, but that's what the central banks were left to do, in part because there was so much polarization in political capitals in Washington and Brussels and many other places.
NEUT38|So you couldn't really get the kind of fiscal stimulus or sort of real Mainstreet effect that you might have if politics had been in a different place.
NEUT39|"So Janet Yellen and her team came in, and this is where we are."""
