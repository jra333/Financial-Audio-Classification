NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Also from disclosure standpoint, I do own shares of Amazon from the long side in my retirement account, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
NEUT5|While a very nice movement since the last update I did on this one last time I did a video, we talked about the general pattern down here and you can see that on Monday got the break out of that pattern and you know the rest has been history.
NEUT6|So that's the general context right now.
NEUT7|Is that this overall pattern Breakout is still underway.
NEUT8|So I'm going to go ahead and delete that out just so we don't have lines and annotations everywhere.
NEUT9|Will try to keep this as clean as possible, but again, that's that's the general context right now.
BULL10|Is attachment pattern, breakout is underway, so as far as some of the newest levels of support or concern in the very near term, and what I would call the ideal of a claim, one makes this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say above 3480.
NEUT11|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3480.
BULL12|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage to actually stay above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT13|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture.
NEUT14|That is with the Purple line comes into play.
NEUT15|The 50.
NEUT16|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT17|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very very helpful because assuming you care about the big picture of things when it comes to just gauging the health of the overall move, that right there being defined as quote unquote, the overall move.
NEUT18|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|Her must visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what is being represented again.
BULL21|Yes and above 3480 would be great.
NEUT22|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the sharp as far as the level at all.
NEUT23|The breakout players are going to be watching.
NEUT24|It's all about that area right there at will.
NEUT25|Call it 3505.
NEUT26|I mean, that was basically the top part of this little consolidation area right here.
NEUT27|So while not a guarantee, are definitely more than valid thoughts at that.
BEAR28|If the price can get a break up through there, that could create quite a bit of upside buying pressure, so we'll see what happens with that going into Wednesday.
BULL29|But All in all, the trend remains plenty in the Bulls favor.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT31|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT36|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT40|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
