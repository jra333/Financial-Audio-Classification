NEUT3|Today is Tuesday, December 11th, 2012.
NEUT4|Today, we're going to be looking at Google Incorporated ticker symbols, GOOG.
BULL5|It's right there and you can see we've been nice.
NEUT6|Sell off here for a bit and then we're starting to form this inverse head and shoulders pattern, which is basically just a shoulder head and shoulders formation turned upside down.
NEUT7|This is the first shoulder formation and this is the head actually dips lower to a low point and then comes back up here and then we formed the second shelter, typically their shoulders going to be roughly the same.
BEAR8|Leveled at negative foreigners from vibrated 63 and this one is 6.
NEUT9|680 or 602.
NEUT10|Stuff like that, so it's close, but there not to exact.
NEUT11|But main thing here is we look at the neckline.
NEUT12|The neckline is simply drawn from the start of the head formation at the end of the head formation.
NEUT13|You simply draw that trendline out.
BEAR14|If this trend line slopes down in this particular chart pattern would be less trustworthy and less impressive when they slope up, there more bullish.
BULL15|And in this particular case it is sloping up.
NEUT16|Confirmation of this chart pattern will be when we close the neckline above the neckline.
NEUT17|Here, we've.
NEUT18|To it now we haven't closed above it yet, so you can wait for that by opportunity or just by now.
NEUT19|As I've marked chart another thing to point out whenever you're looking at this chart pattern.
NEUT20|If you look at the overall situation of chart looking, you think you see an inverse head and shoulders pattern.
BEAR21|Some of the things you can look for we notice strong selling at the actual start of the formation, and then that selling will be gone by the end of the formation so that that just continuation of decreased selling pressure, and oftentimes you'll see an increase on by pressure to start at the head form.
BEAR22|And the ending of the head portion should say gun owners that were stronger than it was over here.
NEUT23|So that's announced.
NEUT24|Basically point out this is just textbook example.
NEUT25|There's many videos on our free website at perfect stock alert, They show you different chart patterns and how to read them, how to trade them to check it out, and I've been there when we look at this chart pattern, you can also get a target for your actual exit point and the way to do that.
NEUT26|Simply take the low point of the head formation all the way up to the next line.
NEUT27|Measure that distance out mathematically, and then add that to the breakout point.
NEUT28|So for example, if we break out.
NEUT29|Today, then we simply take that number and add it to the breakout point.
NEUT30|We get an idea, a target about how we expect price to go about 7:57.
BEAR31|Sixty area basically testing previous high here.
