NEUT0|"""This has been on the radar for investors for months and months and months and months, Vice Chair Stanley Fischer's term was up next year."
NEUT1|Anyway, talk to me about the composition of the Fed, how you expected to change, if at all.
NEUT2|So I think it's going to change quite substantially, and we've just begun to see the beginning of that with Randy Quarles.
NEUT3|And of course, there's still a lot of names floating around for people who might replace Janet Yellen.
NEUT4|Should she leave, you know.
NEUT5|Also, people on the board as well, so I think we're going to see a very substantive change and really more of a shift away from primarily ********** of academics with the more.
NEUT6|Mixture of academics and people have been involved in the business world mocked us that shift from academia to the business world necessarily mean we're going to have this shift away from a dovish Federal Reserve.
NEUT7|It's been a dovish Federal Reserve for a long, long time.
NEUT8|Now, is that going to change?
NEUT9|I don't think so.
BULL10|I think if we shift to a more business friendly environment, I think the backdrop would probably be one that probably favors a weaker U.S. dollar.
NEUT11|So the administration's been pretty clear that they prefer a weaker dollar, so if there is a new composition at the Fed and is supports supposedly supposed to be a little bit more business friendly, I would anticipate that would be pretty weak for the US dollar.
NEUT12|Another question is what the President wants as he appoints fed members.
NEUT13|I mean, seriously, tweet.
NEUT14|Not only do we have quite a few openings at this point, but we have a president who.
BEAR15|I've been actually somewhat conflicted about what he said because during the campaign he said the Fed was at fault because they were keeping the rates too low.
NEUT16|Other times he said he likes low interest rates.
NEUT17|How much is that exaggerated situation?
BEAR18|Wardwell you raise a very good point because President Trump's comments on the Fed have been conflicted, which is not unusual for President Trump.
NEUT19|I think now that he is in the White House.
NEUT20|However, what he wants to see is an economy that continues to grow so he'll be sympathetic to a fed that is somewhat slow to raise rates.
NEUT21|"What I do think what we will see going forward is that the Fed, regardless of who comes in after Janet Yellen and I do think she's going to leave is going to pursue normalization a little bit more systematically than we've seen so far."""
