BEAR0|"""Another day and a another flash crash, this time to do with a fake tweet caused a big swoon in the S&P and the Dow Jones Industrial Average."
NEUT1|Welcome to the digits here to tell us all about it.
NEUT2|Jonathan Chang of the Wall Street Journal and Jonathan.
NEUT3|That we were all connected watching the tweets.
NEUT4|It had a big effect, right?
NEUT5|That's right.
NEUT6|I wish I could tell you everything that happened.
NEUT7|We do know that there was a fake tweet we don't know yet who is behind this or what happened.
NEUT8|But we do know that AP of course vary widely read.
NEUT9|They've got a lot of followers, you know they don't just do financial news to do a little bit of everything, and they had a tweet out on their feed that said that the White House had been attacked.
BEAR10|That two bombs had gone off that the president had been hurt.
NEUT11|That's right.
NEUT12|Now, minutes later, the AP took that down and said that they had been hacked.
NEUT13|Jay Carney, the spokesperson for the White House, also came out and said this was bogus, and that things like that happen.
NEUT14|But what happened in the market was we saw, and we saw on the on the chart there this and you can see it there.
NEUT15|But there's other black line that's the swoon down this massive dive in stocks, just for a few moments and then back up now.
NEUT16|This happened yesterday, not with that week, but with Google, right?
BEAR17|And then it was not quite as that was a 3% drop.
NEUT18|This was actually not quite 3%, but this was the whole market.
NEUT19|So in some ways this is more dramatic.
NEUT20|We still don't know what was behind the Google, but I think if you look at all of the common factors behind these so called flash crashes, it is computers.
NEUT21|It is the fact that the whole system we have now is built on a foundation that is handled a lot automatically and with algorithms.
NEUT22|And of course you know a lot of people have so-called cell stops that there's an advance orders to sell when.
BEAR23|Price hits a certain level an if you saw the price go down then you stop so triggered the sell orders go in, it can exacerbate it, but worse than that today is that you would have sold, right would have gone back up.
BULL24|That's right on and on a day where we're up about 1% you would have been flat on the day and that's 90.
NEUT25|Have paid for the privilege.
NEUT26|That's right.
NEUT27|Permission for that.
NEUT28|Now what we notice is basically across all asset classes reacted is what I was hearing.
BULL29|So Golden oil were up as well.
NEUT30|Actually, gold didn't really respond all that much Forex.
NEUT31|We didn't see that much of a move but oil.
NEUT32|We saw a similar move to what we saw in stocks and we saw the VIX, which is what we call the fear gauge that measures trading in futures and options and so on.
BEAR33|And basically it showed that there was a big spike in jitters that came right back down again.
NEUT34|I mean, I think the final point of course is that everything went back to where it was just a few minutes earlier.
NEUT35|But in the meantime, yes, if you had.
BEAR36|A cell loss, yeah, you lost out.
NEUT37|And even if you're an ordinary investor in this and he didn't lose any money, it's got to shake your confidence again because we're interconnected and you have a lot of.
NEUT38|Even if you don't freak out about it, you have a computer doing it somewhere on your behalf, and that affects your portfolio as well.
NEUT39|So Ouch.
NEUT40|Or, well, something something worth thinking about.
BULL41|Thank you very much.
NEUT42|Jonathan Chang of the Wall Street Journal.
