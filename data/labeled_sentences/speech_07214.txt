NEUT0|"""Joining us now is Alex Coffee at TD Ameritrade."
BULL1|Great to have you back on the show.
NEUT2|Always a pleasure.
NEUT3|I know you're watching what's going on with the market.
NEUT4|What's your reaction so far this week?
BULL5|It's been an incredible week.
BEAR6|Still strong, weak from the equity standpoint as we've appeared to make a bottom at least for now.
BEAR7|And we're about 10% off those lows that we made on Christmas Eve.
BULL8|And so it's been remarkable to see S rebound as much as we have, but it's been on the heels of a strong jobs number and.
BULL9|Positive things on the tariff front as far with China so far, but still nothing concrete on that.
NEUT10|Let's take a look at your trades now.
NEUT11|United is on your list and then we talk about this on the show.
NEUT12|The airlines tend to be a barometer at some point of what's going on with the economy, so the airlines tend to rise when the economy is doing well.
NEUT13|What are you saying they do?
BULL14|And so Imperial actually came out and lowered their price target down significantly about a 25% cut which is.
NEUT15|But as much as you'll see on those price targets being cut, and so we're seeing the 82 puts trading in January, and I believe it's kind of a hedge on some of those long positions.
BEAR16|If what they're worried about with some of the China slowdown and tough compareable revenue comparisons at Boeing is another stack that's been trading with the tariff talk, it absolutely has.
BULL17|And so I'm seeing the three 45350 call spreads trading in January and with the US and China in the midst of these trade talks, it's an optimistic bet.
BULL18|That those are going well.
BULL19|Another stack you happen to be watching Disney, and so Disney I'm seeing the 1:15 calls actually trading in February and that appears to be on the heels of some strong subscriber growth and AD revenue growth in Hulu.
NEUT20|Which Disney owns 60% of its bullish on Disney bullish on Disney?
BULL21|Thanks for coming on the show.
NEUT22|Always a pleasure.
BULL23|"Thank you."""
