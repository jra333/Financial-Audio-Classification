BULL0|"""Zelica coin staking price prediction January 3rd."
NEUT1|In today's silica coin staking price prediction zelica coins strong fundamentals alright, let's get started.
BULL2|Positive news, active communities and a shift toward the fire appeared to be the catalysts responsible for the rallies seen in silica zelica, Zilling said.
BULL3|I'll token has risen sharply in 2020.
BULL4|Part of the rally could be attributed to the decentralized finance boom that dominated a large portion of the year after launching its decentralized exchange.
NEUT5|ZIL swap on October 5th and non custodial staking on October 14th.
BULL6|The token rallied considerably.
NEUT7|These new features allowed the community to stake directly in the smart contract, whereas previously they had to do it through a third party intermediary.
BULL8|To date, the community has staked about 30.49% of the total outstanding supply, and the low eligibility threshold of 10s at AOL may have attracted greater participation from token holders during the coronavirus pandemic.
NEUT9|Most people have stayed indoors and spent their time on social media, just the timing of silica social pay launch could not have been better.
NEUT10|The platform launched in May and it rewards users for sharing silicas updates and announcements on Twitter.
NEUT11|All these fundamental developments may be the reason for the increase in the number of wallet addresses and monthly transactions in 2020.
BULL12|But can the token continue its outperformance in 2021?
BULL13|The old coin has been in a strong uptrend and it rallied from an intraday low at $0.00 point 0296388 on December 12th to an intraday high at 0.0996 dollars.
BULL14|On December 27th at 236% rally in about 2 weeks.
BEAR15|Usually these vertical rallies are not sustainable in the long run.
BULL16|Periodic corrections or consolidations and needed that can cool the up, move and increase the longevity of the trend.
BULL17|That said, I'll USD pair has formed successive inside day candle stick patterns on December 28th and today.
BEAR18|This suggests a contraction in volatility as the Bulls and the Bears decide on the next directional move.
BEAR19|If the inside day resolves to the upside, the uptrend could resume.
BEAR20|Conversely, if the inside day candle is followed by a sharp down move, the Bears may have gained the upper hand and a deeper correction would be expected.
NEUT21|Therefore, if the bears sink the price below.
NEUT22|The 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $0.00 point 0728748.
BEAR23|A drop to the 50% retracement level at $0.00 point 0646194 and then to the 20 day exponential moving average 0.0570 dollars is possible.
BULL24|A strong bounce off.
BULL25|This support hints that the positive sentiment remains intact as traders are accumulating on dips.
BULL26|The Bulls will then attempt to resume the uptrend and if they can push the price above 0.0996 dollars a rally to 14 cents may be possible.
BEAR27|On the other hand, if the price slides below the 20 day EMA, it will suggest that a short term top could be in place as bulls are not keen to buy on dips.
