BEAR0|"""Number still welcome back to our trading and it's been a couple weeks that I haven't posted any video."
NEUT1|I was super busy with my other work.
NEUT2|And I am here with a new stock GE and this stock has.
NEUT3|Gap up quite a bit and trying to do a reversal so as you can see this stock is.
BULL4|On its uptrend since last week or a month, and as you can see the stock went higher.
NEUT5|Then today's price.
NEUT6|As you can see right now it was down training three months ago.
NEUT7|I don't know what happened to the company, but looks like this is a health care company or an looks like this is a big company that has a lot of employees on this company so.
BULL8|This company has a better potential on investing into.
BULL9|And it's right around idiot sense right now has the potential of going up to $1.50.
NEUT10|And if you guys are planning to invest in this, this is a good idea.
NEUT11|This is a penny stock.
NEUT12|As you can see today I invested.
NEUT13|1000 Two 1100 cheers.
NEUT14|And.
NEUT15|I got a profit of $300.
NEUT16|You can see I'm holding this stock for tomorrow.
BULL17|It kind of went up one since after hour.
NEUT18|So I'm so gay having some gain so it can see.
NEUT19|These two stock has a better potential than any other stock, but this is a really small cap.
NEUT20|Stocks, so it's kind of risky sometimes.
NEUT21|Keep eye on your guys and make sure you guys put a stop loss.
BULL22|And minimize the risks and I hope you guys are safe.
NEUT23|And.
NEUT24|Make sure you guys are washing hands and everything, so make sure you guys save and I will catch you guys tomorrow.
NEUT25|"Keep eye on it and if you guys are planning to do penny stocks, keep eye on it again."""
