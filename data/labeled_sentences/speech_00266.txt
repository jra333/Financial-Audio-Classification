NEUT0|"""Hi and welcome to the Datacamp course on importing and managing financial data in our."
NEUT1|My name is Joshua Ulrich and I'll be your guide throughout the course a bit about me.
NEUT2|I'm the creator or Co.
NEUT3|Author of several R packages, including TTR XTS Quant, MoD Blotter, and Quant Strat.
NEUT4|I'm also on the R Finance Conference organizing Committee and I founded the Saint Louis R user group.
NEUT5|This course will teach you how to import financial and economic data and manipulate it into a form suitable for analysis and modeling.
NEUT6|Let's get started.
NEUT7|The first function I'd like to introduce you to is get symbols from the quad package.
NEUT8|Get Symbols provides a consistent interface to multiple data sources.
NEUT9|Get Symbols is also extensible, so it's straightforward to add new data sources.
NEUT10|By default, get symbol stores data in an XTS object, but it can use other classes as well.
NEUT11|Get symbols can also import data two ways it can either return the data like a normal function or you can create an object for you similar to what the load function in base R does.
NEUT12|Let's take a look at an example.
NEUT13|The first argument to get symbols is symbols, which is how you specify the instrument you want to import.
NEUT14|This may be a stock ticker symbol and exchange rate and economic data series or some other identifier.
NEUT15|Since you always specify a symbol, it's customary to omit.
NEUT16|The symbols argument from your call to get symbols.
NEUT17|Another important argument is SRC or source, which tells get symbols, which data source to import the data from the default data sources.
NEUT18|Yahoo so you do not need to specify that argument.
NEUT19|If you want to import data from Yahoo Finance in this course.
NEUT20|We will only cover some of the data sources get symbol supports namely Yahoo Finance, Google Finance.
NEUT21|the Federal Reserve economic data or Fred database provided by the Saint Louis Federal Reserve Bank.
NEUT22|And foreign exchange from olanda, com and CSV files.
NEUT23|Other get symbols.
NEUT24|Data sources include Yahoo Finance, Japan, my SQL SQL Lite database is our data files and RDS files.
NEUT25|As I mentioned earlier, get symbols can import data two ways.
NEUT26|The auto assign argument controls whether the data is returned or loaded.
NEUT27|If auto assign is true, data will be loaded into your workspace.
NEUT28|If auto assign is false, get symbols will return the data and you will need to assign it to an object.
NEUT29|"Now that you've been formally introduced, it's time to practice using Git symbols."""
