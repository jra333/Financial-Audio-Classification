NEUT0|"""What's interesting, Joe, is that there's a new young crop of buyers who do not sell in the news."
NEUT1|I mean, the moment we got some news from Moderna that was positive, there was a surge of buying in the airlines, which I believe is done through an ETF through a lot of the hospitality and they don't.
NEUT2|They tend not to get shaken out.
NEUT3|I mean that's how we got to appear there, Joe.
NEUT4|They're very different from the older buyers, they just don't seem to be.
NEUT5|They don't seem to want to sell.
NEUT6|They see good news and they buy and then no one comes forward to sell.
NEUT7|It's rather remarkable we haven't seen this pattern ever.
NEUT8|Not 1999 ever.
BULL9|Monday a week ago was good.
NEUT10|Jim 'cause?
NEUT11|I don't know, it just gave us sort of a possibility for what the future could could be in terms of not like it is not like it is right now an an.
NEUT12|But then again, you know if we goes by and it's like I don't know when are we going to have it.
NEUT13|You hear all the naysayers.
NEUT14|I don't know people that.
NEUT15|I don't know people that don't almost seem like they don't want things yesterday.
NEUT16|Not sure what it is.
NEUT17|I don't know what it is, but then you get a second data point that looks good and now I'm feeling very confident that we're going to be having you know if we ever decide we're going to be having margaritas again, right next to each other without thinking about it, I think that you hit on something Joe that is really incredible.
NEUT18|There's either an we or corrosive attitude.
BULL19|This is great news.
NEUT20|Think about what we would if we had gotten this news for months ago.
NEUT21|Instead, people that kind of?
NEUT22|Oh yeah, I mean.
NEUT23|They're probably insider selling to no.
NEUT24|I mean, I, I was surprised that it was 94.
NEUT25|I thought Pfizer was amazing.
BULL26|I think that your show is uplifting and there's people who don't seem to want to be uplifted.
NEUT27|And I haven't figured that quite figured that out yet.
NEUT28|I can't figure it out either.
NEUT29|I guess I don't know.
NEUT30|House is not burning.
NEUT31|I don't know that the story becomes less compelling when it's good.
NEUT32|I don't.
NEUT33|I don't understand what causes it.
NEUT34|I think we stay safe, but they're not good until we get it.
NEUT35|And then, like it can resume.
BULL36|And that's just amazing.
NEUT37|It will be amazing at what we used to take for granted.
BULL38|We will, we will.
BULL39|We will love once again.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
