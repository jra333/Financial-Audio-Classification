BULL0|"""Lululemon Athletica shares up 8% this morning."
BULL1|Lululemon raised guidance for the full fiscal year.
BULL2|This is a nice boost for for the raising the guidance, and I think it's safe to assume that they had a good holiday quarter.
BEAR3|Yeah, this shocks me because they were they had reported in early December and the numbers were a little soft.
NEUT4|This is a premium product that I didn't get.
NEUT5|Not really in line with who did well target Walmart.
BULL6|Those had good holiday season.
NEUT7|If you walk into target there is a huge display of they don't call it fake lululemon, but you know Lala Larry or whatever.
NEUT8|Whatever their fake brand is.
NEUT9|So this is.
BULL10|This shows a real strength that people you know the economy is pretty good, and they're willing to buy $70.00 yoga pants.
NEUT11|I was less surprised, but that's because I have young women in my house and in terms of what was on various Christmas wish lists and that sort of thing.
NEUT12|And there's a little lemon right here in Old Town and over break, there was a there was an excursion.
NEUT13|All that, all, that sort of thing.
NEUT14|Are you at all surprised?
NEUT15|Not necessarily just by this 'cause I know you're surprised by this, but.
NEUT16|There was a stretch of time where the success of Lululemon was talked about, first with praise and then followed by, but I don't see how they keep this up.
NEUT17|I don't, you know, the how big is the market for $100 yoga pants and?
BULL18|The track record of Lululemon over the past ten years is pretty impressive.
NEUT19|Well, I think they've moved beyond the sort of trendy like remember when vineyard vines everyone had to have?
NEUT20|That shirt of the high school kids?
BEAR21|They still have a little bit of that, so they haven't fallen into like the negative.
NEUT22|Sometimes you get backlash where it becomes really.
NEUT23|Not cool.
NEUT24|That didn't happen, and that's because it's a quality product.
NEUT25|I don't look like it, but I've done hundreds of yoga classes over the last few years, and if someone is wearing cheap yoga pants that's not great, and so for the actual yoga market, lululemon is a really good product and I'm sure there are less pricey, maybe targets.
NEUT26|Maybe Amazon's, but you don't know.
NEUT27|And if it's the difference between your yoga pants being see through or not, I think you might spend the extra money so they've established that this brand is good, and I think that will transcend sort of the up and down trendiness of the label.
BULL28|And they've also done a good job of expanding the offerings for men.
NEUT29|I mean that was something when they when they initially talked about this is going to be a focus for us.
NEUT30|I was one of those people saying come on really, is that really got no and it actually is and and it goes to what you said, it's the quality they make quality stuff.
NEUT31|I laughed 'cause there's a man who does yoga.
NEUT32|It is very challenging to figure out what to wear.
NEUT33|You know you can't really wear sweatpants, you'll see guys like show up and slacks like nobody knows what to do or so to be able to buy, you know, sort of a quality pant that like you're not wearing a woman's outfit, you're wearing something made for men.
NEUT34|"They've really figured it out and they're answering a question that maybe the rest of the market didn't believe was being asked, but every guy in a yoga studio was asking."""
