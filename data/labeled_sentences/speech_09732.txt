BULL0|"""Hey y'all, it's Austin with invest, the rest CC Ivy and lucid."
NEUT1|It's finally happening.
NEUT2|Let's talk about it.
NEUT3|I need to start by saying this price drop is not a bad thing.
NEUT4|It's investors with paper hands taking their profits on a big jump today I'm not getting out yet.
NEUT5|True investors will pull this back to where it was and many times more.
BEAR6|This price drop could also be from an overvaluation of lucid at 15 billion, with some reports of it being upwards of $24 billion.
NEUT7|This would overvalue the company and some people's opinions, causing them to take whatever profits they made an get out, but I will be staying in for awhile with all the promising news an upcoming projects coming from lucid.
NEUT8|Onto the news.
BULL9|Late Monday, Lucid and Churchill Capital came together and agreed to the long anticipated merger with available funds close to $5 billion.
BULL10|This luxury car company has a great start and plenty of room for big growth in the coming months and years.
BULL11|My price prediction for this is up near $100 in a couple of months.
BULL12|There will undoubtedly be high volatility in the next coming weeks, but it should stable out and start his climb up.
BEAR13|I am not getting cold feet whatsoever with this merger and I can't stress enough how short term this sell off was.
BULL14|If anything, I'm buying this step and thanking all the short term investors for their gift.
