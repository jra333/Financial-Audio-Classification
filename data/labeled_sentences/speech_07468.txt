NEUT10|I post in real time the reason for investing one to three months rather than long term is that I don't get as much salary as Jhongli Pro Long term investor recognizing the value investment as long term holding.
NEUT11|It is a longer can make long term investment only if it has the power to withstand that is profits from the salary or short term return on investment, regardless of whether the stock rises or not.
