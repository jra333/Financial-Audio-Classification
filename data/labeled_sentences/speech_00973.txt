NEUT0|"""So the first one I have is I be I will."
NEUT1|So if you see down here, volume has picked up a lot, so this month, not this month in July last year, around 1 billion shares were traded in June and then around 800,000,000 shares were trading.
BULL2|So looks like even in Jan this year the volume has picked up a little bit, so it went up to $6 and then it came back.
NEUT3|Now it looks like it wants to go back up again, so it might it might be too Dollar 15 or dollar twenty.
BULL4|That will be a good buying opportunity and then expected, I think by the end of this month hopefully or next month it will retest $4.50.
NEUT5|So $4.50 is my first target on this one.
NEUT6|So the next one I have is VBA vaccines, so they're into vaccines business.
NEUT7|You can easily find what's going on with them.
BULL8|Google it and will get a lot of information, but it has been moving up consistently for past purpose 2-3 months, so my target and this one is $6, but it looks pretty good, so by any day in future I might.
NEUT9|Let's take my tip 24.
NEUT10|I mean 350 or 360.
NEUT11|It may or may not, but I think $6 is the first target that I have on this.
BULL12|So if you see monthly chart, if you see down here the huge volume has picked up.
BEAR13|I mean, it's a huge volume last year, so and then it came down it came down after hitting $7.00 it came down and I'm expecting it will go back and test seven $6 again.
NEUT14|So let's see how it goes.
BULL15|"But it really looks good."""
