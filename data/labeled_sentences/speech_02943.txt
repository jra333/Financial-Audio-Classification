NEUT0|"""So this is definitely the question of the week."
NEUT1|How do I buy shares of Facebook's IPO you seen on the news?
NEUT2|Facebook just filed a 5 billion initial public offering.
NEUT3|Not really sure when the stocks actually going to be available to the public, But this is definitely the largest IPO filing.
BULL4|Beating Google back in 2004 and most recently Zynga with their 1 billion.
NEUT5|$1 billion filing in December.
NEUT6|So I've had several clients, several friends, several people that just know me and want to know Jeff.
NEUT7|How do I get in the action?
NEUT8|How do I actually buy Facebook shares of this IPO?
NEUT9|Unfortunately, break some bad news for you ain't going to happen.
NEUT10|Let me tell you how it works for you to get in and offering.
NEUT11|Especially like this.
NEUT12|You gotta have some deep pockets.
NEUT13|You're going to have some big doe an if you're not some big investment banker on Wall Street.
NEUT14|Or if you don't have millions and millions of dollars, you're not getting it.
NEUT15|Any IPO stock?
NEUT16|At least I can get until actually hits the secondary market.
BEAR17|Sorry to break the bad news for you.
NEUT18|The only experience I had with an IPO other than the firm to work for was whenever Under Armour came out an I knew the client that had well over a couple $1,000,000 and they put in a request to buy IPO Under Armour.
NEUT19|And this is a pretty.
NEUT20|Buzzed up IPO at the time they were only able to buy, I think like $100,000 worth, which doesn't seem like a lot, but not as much as you would think based on the amount that they wanted to buy.
BULL21|They put in a pretty big ticket.
NEUT22|So with the buzz and all the hoopla that you're hearing about the Facebook IPO for you for us, the average investor, the common investor, the little people is not going to happen.
NEUT23|We're not going to get it.
NEUT24|You'll be able to build it by in the secondary market, so this is after the IPO hits.
BEAR25|And it's already prices shot up.
NEUT26|So then we'll be able to get some.
NEUT27|Hopefully if it's affordable.
NEUT28|So sorry to break the bad news for you, but buying shares of Facebook IPO is probably not going to happen.
NEUT29|This is Jeff Rose.
BULL30|"Good financial sense will see you soon."""
