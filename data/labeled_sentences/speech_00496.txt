NEUT0|"""Welcome back to another video value investors."
NEUT1|Today, we're going to be looking at the real value of Dexcom what's Dex Coms?
NEUT2|Intrinsic value, little start.
NEUT3|Dexcom is a company that develops manufacturers and distributes continuous glucose monitoring systems for folks with diabetes.
NEUT4|Now, instantly, there's a contingency that I see.
NEUT5|And that's the fact that Dexcom makes its money from folks who are unfortunately sick.
NEUT6|So if those folks get healthy, right?
NEUT7|And that's really the trend these days for most of the developed world.
BEAR8|To become healthier than Dexcom, suddenly loses its on its value proposition.
NEUT9|So we're already wary.
BULL10|In 2018, they've made $1.032 billion, which is excellent.
NEUT11|You can see that here.
NEUT12|And they were founded in 1999.
NEUT13|But what I want to know is what's it standing on now?
NEUT14|What's its intrinsic value and what's its actual share price?
NEUT15|Then we can make a decision on an investment.
NEUT16|So currently its intrinsic value lies on a range and on the low end of things we're looking at $0.91 per share.
NEUT17|And this is based off of Dex Coms, cash and cash equivalents, right?
NEUT18|So for every share that it has, it has $0.91 in cash and cash equivalents about on the high end of things.
BEAR19|Well, on the high end it has negative $11.74.
NEUT20|In value right?
NEUT21|And this is based if you look at the address bar here that function.
BEAR22|This is based off of its net profits media net profit over the last 10 years, which is incredibly negative.
BEAR23|So this is negative.
NEUT24|$54 million * 20 Because this is what Benjamin Graham suggests that our time horizon should be in divided by its total shares outstanding to normalize the figure and we get this strange and odd number now.
NEUT25|What this means is that the company would have to pay us so we have to pay you $11.74 per share in order to facilitate the transaction.
BEAR26|That's how poor performing this stock is.
NEUT27|It's not good, so we already have the diabetes contingency, right?
NEUT28|They only make money if people are sick, which is not cool.
NEUT29|I mean, I'm not making any moral judgments here, but I'm just saying that it's a contingency that if people are healthy then they're not making money and then also we have the fact that they haven't posted net profits consistently.
BEAR30|They've really only posted net losses on a consistent basis.
NEUT31|So let's proceed forward.
NEUT32|What are they trading at today?
BULL33|Wow, they trading at an astounding $355.02 per share, which is an incredibly large figure.
NEUT34|Of course, we're not going to be investing, but we need some place to park our money, so I don't want to leave you guys out to dry.
NEUT35|If you need a place to park your money and you're considering an investment in Dex.
NEUT36|Com or some alternative right, that will maybe NACHA the average or an S&P 500 index fund, right?
NEUT37|That tracks a certain set of companies and it's conservative.
NEUT38|Well, I recommend that you guys invest in the Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT39|The VF Iax, it's the same fund that Warren Buffett used in 2008 to beat out the hedge fund folks in his famous bet where he was $1,000,000 bet and he said I bet you I can buy this fund and do nothing and beat you guys.
BULL40|Beat the professionals in New York City and.
NEUT41|That's exactly what happened.
NEUT42|You won the bet in 2018, so parking money here.
NEUT43|It's relatively the same price, just a couple dollars cheaper.
NEUT44|As a matter of fact, and look at that strong trendline in the upward direction.
NEUT45|So this is where I would park your money until.
NEUT46|This figure?
NEUT47|Well it's not even about their share price.
NEUT48|They just need to start posting some net profits, right?
NEUT49|They can't have this.
