NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back with the video today it is your boy will.
NEUT2|Hope you guys had a good Christmas when you guys have a good day and we will be talking about the zoom ticker symbol VM.
NEUT3|I'm gonna give you guys a couple of levels to look at.
NEUT4|And overall how I think the stock will be going.
NEUT5|Also, my Patreon is live, it will be the first link in my description below.
NEUT6|I can give you guys some buy and sell alerts.
NEUT7|You could tell me what stocks you want me to look at to give you support levels bullish levels.
NEUT8|If you should be bearish, bullish resistance levels, ask me questions and all that good stuff.
NEUT9|So check that out the link below.
NEUT10|I am only accepting 50 people and once I hit that number it will be closed OK.
NEUT11|So let's get into the video.
BEAR12|OK, so zoom has been going down.
NEUT13|Not fully any support levels, so I'll give you guys some level to look at.
NEUT14|I would say if Zoom gets above.
NEUT15|Were a. OK, let's make this red.
NEUT16|So this is the level.
BEAR17|If it gets above, I will turn bullish.
NEUT18|Tell me this is 408 fifty, so I think it's about this level that will be bullish.
BEAR19|But right now we are bearish.
NEUT20|And I do think it will go below.
NEUT21|Three 6628 New 66.
BEAR22|I do think it's going all the way below here an even lower.
NEUT23|And the only support that I see.
NEUT24|The only support that I see on zone.
NEUT25|Is a popular for years.
NEUT26|OK, so if it comes above this level, it will be bullish and you want to come up here.
NEUT27|Kind of trade down and hold that level at their trade higher.
NEUT28|We don't just wanted to shoot up quicker then when you have sharp moves like this as you see sharp down.
BULL29|Please come after so we want a nice consistent up move and this is a critical level.
NEUT30|We will turn Bullers right now.
BEAR31|We are bearish.
BEAR32|I do think it will go below this level and the only support I see.
BEAR33|The only real support I really see is very low, around 300.
NEUT34|Put that line up.
NEUT35|I would say around this level is only support I see.
BEAR36|And room so it might drop all the way here.
NEUT37|But we need to see how zoom does next week to really get a clear indication of it, but I do think it is one of the lower next week and see how it trades in this range.
BULL38|So for us to see if we can get some more support and resistance levels out of that.
NEUT39|OK, so if it comes here will be bullish.
NEUT40|I do think will come down here 'cause we're bearish now and then we wait to see how it trades in this range.
NEUT41|This is a support level, but we just leave it raised restaurant.
NEUT42|OK, so that's the play for zoom.
NEUT43|Remember this is not a recommendation of our so anything is for educational purposes only.
NEUT44|"So do not rate even you see or hear on these videos and I would catch you guys in the next one."""
