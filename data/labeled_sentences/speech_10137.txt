NEUT0|"""Hello and namaste."
NEUT1|Now in this video we're going to discuss what exactly is a Demat account.
NEUT2|What you can store in this dream at account and how to operate these Demat account.
NEUT3|Also what trades can you place in the medical.
NEUT4|However if you have not seen how to open these Demat account please click on this.
NEUT5|I believe that account is just like an online bank account except in a bank account.
NEUT6|You always show money right cash deposit that you make in this Demat account.
NEUT7|You can also deposit cash.
NEUT8|However you hold shares or stocks of companies in dematerialised form or online form, so you can redeem them online.
NEUT9|You can purchase them online and they exist in a virtual platform called the Demat account.
NEUT10|You can also buy mutual funds, PLSS ETF's etc.
NEUT11|Now what are all these would be discussed in the successive videos?
NEUT12|However, just note that a Demat account is an online bank account just like an online bank account where you store your portfolio investments.
NEUT13|OK, now there are two types of trades that you can do through a demat account.
NEUT14|One is an intraday trade and this next one is called it delivering tree.
NEUT15|What exactly is an introductory interest rate is the trade which you have to finish on the same date.
NEUT16|For example equity market or a share market opens at 9:15 AM and closes at 3:30 PM.
NEUT17|So during the day if you buy any stock of XY zed company you have to sell that stock buy before the day ends or before the market closes.
NEUT18|However, in a delivery stock or a delivery trade, you can buy the stock and just hold it in the Demat account.
NEUT19|As long as you wish for now, let's take a simple example.
NEUT20|For example.
NEUT21|It's just Thursday market opens at 9:15 AM.
NEUT22|You think of bike Infosys to suppose you buy that stock ₹4000 OK you buy one stock ₹4000 at 3:15 or 3:30 PM.
NEUT23|The stock is trading at ₹1200.
NEUT24|So if you want to do an intraday trade.
NEUT25|You would immediately sell the Infosys stock and book a profit of 200 or ₹250 and this would sit in your Demat account.
NEUT26|Now if you want to do a delivery dream.
NEUT27|So if the stock you have bought of Infosys and ₹1000 at 11:00 AM and you wish to hold it, you don't want to sell it when the market closes then you can ask the broker to change it into a delivery stock and keep it in your demat account.
NEUT28|So when the market opens on Friday you already have the Infosys top in your inventory.
NEUT29|Existing in your Demat account.
NEUT30|Suppose on Friday it sells at ₹1300.
NEUT31|So you can sell their trade.
NEUT32|You can sell the stock and realize profit of 300 which would again be deposited in your Demat account.
NEUT33|However this is not an intraday trade because the trade was opened on Thursday and was closed on Friday.
NEUT34|So this will be called a delivery trade.
NEUT35|Now the taxation also differs on this.
NEUT36|The income tax will charge 30% on your profits if you do an intraday profit.
NEUT37|And for delivery it would be depending on whether you close in the current financial year or whether you close in the next financial year in the current financial year it would be according to your tax lab, whereas if you close in the next financial year it would be 10% of your profits.
NEUT38|Only that's it for today's video.
