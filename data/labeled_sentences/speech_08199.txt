NEUT0|"""Doug, can you kind of start by telling people why Snowflake is such a valuable asset in general here?"
NEUT1|I think over the last decade we've heard so much about this trend toward big data and the next evolution in our opinion of big data is really big data management because the point of big data is to create intelligent software.
NEUT2|It's to create incredible experiences for users, and it's really the precursor to AI.
NEUT3|And what snowflake does.
NEUT4|I think why people are really excited about it thematically is it is sort of that bridge in our opinion, from big data to more intelligent software, they help companies essentially.
NEUT5|Architect their data more intelligently in the cloud.
NEUT6|Sorry that we were joking about Hadoop second ago, but I mean who are the rivals in this space?
NEUT7|How much of a lead does Snowflake have?
NEUT8|How much of a Moat does it have to use the Percher language?
NEUT9|So I think really when I think about their competition, some of their biggest competition are actually the companies they work with.
NEUT10|The cloud providers themselves.
NEUT11|A WS, Google, Microsoft with Azure.
NEUT12|Those are the ones that I would be most focused on.
NEUT13|Certainly there's other ones in the market like Hadoop.
NEUT14|There's other companies that are sort of.
NEUT15|I'd say in the same game in the same League companies like Databricks, which is a private company still.
NEUT16|But I do think that if I were an investor in Snowflake I would be focused more on those big cloud providers trying to expand their capabilities.
NEUT17|Ryan sort of shutting snowflake out of the market.
NEUT18|As we know Amazon loves to go down the balance sheet and turn every cost center into new revenue item so Snowflake would appear to be a candidate for that.
NEUT19|What's its valuation right now?
NEUT20|Doug at about $245.00 this morning right about its IPO price.
NEUT21|What are we talking about in terms of the multiple on revenue and does it generate earnings?
NEUT22|It doesn't generate earnings yet.
NEUT23|I think in in our rough estimate it's somewhere around 70 times next year's revenue.
BULL24|So as Leslie said, that would make it even at the time of the IPO.
BEAR25|I think it was one of the most expensive software companies in the market, and now I think it is foreign foreign away.
NEUT26|One of the most expensive companies in the software market.
NEUT27|We are cautious here.
NEUT28|The valuation I think is rich and I think when you see these names, there's often this very restricted float in an IPO.
NEUT29|So.
BEAR30|These price moves sometimes can be exaggerated because there's not enough sellers to really meet the demand in the market, and so over the next 6 to 12 months.
BULL31|I think we're going to see more volatility in the name, and I think long term investors might get another chance at a more attractive valuation.
NEUT32|So Doug, I read a quote that someone said that the pandemic accelerated this cloud adoption or the cloud migration by 10 years.
NEUT33|And I, you know, we're hearing everything is the pandemic, you know, stay at home, it's accelerated.
NEUT34|Everything.
NEUT35|Is that true in?
NEUT36|Why do you agree with that?
NEUT37|10 years feels aggressive to me.
NEUT38|I would believe it if it was maybe a year or two.
BULL39|I think we've certainly seen this acceleration in terms of productivity software software to help people work at home.
NEUT40|Much of that software is managed in the cloud, but when I think about the bigger opportunity in the cloud, it's moving everything.
NEUT41|Even things beyond this sort of work at home trend in the cloud, so I think it's maybe more like a year or two.
BULL42|It's been accelerated.
NEUT43|That doesn't mean that the trend isn't real.
NEUT44|I think it's still a real long term trend.
NEUT45|Cloud computing is.
BULL46|"Is here to stay, but I don't think it's been accelerated that quickly."""
