NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Lou Mango and this is quick pics where we communicate to you so the markets."
NEUT1|Best investment opportunities in just three minutes.
NEUT2|Today we're going to be talking about one of my favorite growth stocks.
NEUT3|The name Facebook ticker FB.
NEUT4|But we're not going to be talking about why Facebook is such a great long term investment opportunity.
NEUT5|It is instead we're going to be talking about why Facebook stock and had significantly higher over the next 12 months on one catalyst Instagram reels.
NEUT6|So what is Instagram reels?
NEUT7|Will Instagram reels?
NEUT8|Is Facebook's copycat of Tick tock the viral Chinese social media app that comprises short form consumer videos and which is gained significant traction in the US and globally during the COVID-19 pandemic?
BEAR9|Because we're all bored out of our minds, and because Tik T.O.K is super super entertaining, so this is obviously bad facelift because the more time you and I spend on Tick Tock is less time that we spend.
NEUT10|And on Facebook.
NEUT11|And on Instagram.
NEUT12|So Facebook has to respond and then responding by playing copycat by copying the core functionality.
NEUT13|OB tick tock making short form.
NEUT14|Addictive videos and integrating that into Instagram so that you can do on on Instagram what you're already doing on tick.
NEUT15|Tock well it work.
NEUT16|Of course this is not the first time Facebook has played copycat and the last time they did it in 2016 with Instagram stories.
BULL17|It was a huge success, right?
NEUT18|They launched the game stories in August 2016.
BULL19|Then throughout little back after 2016 and 2017 at end of the first half of 2018 you got accelerated user growth.
BULL20|Accelerated revenue growth.
NEUT21|A bunch of double beat quarters and the stock went from 1:20 to 2:20.
BULL22|So huge success.
NEUT23|Can reels replicate that success?
NEUT24|I think the answer of course is yes for two big reasons.
NEUT25|One distribution to convenience.
NEUT26|Distribution matters.
NEUT27|For content on social media, we want more eyeballs.
NEUT28|We want more views.
NEUT29|We want more likes.
NEUT30|We want more clicks.
NEUT31|So we're going to go where we get more of those things where the distribution is greatest.
BULL32|Instagram has unrivalled distribution everywhere.
NEUT33|Yes, Tik T.O.K is big but only 100,000,000 monthly actives in the US.
NEUT34|Instagram more than 120,000,000 monthly active.
BULL35|So they still have superior distribution.
NEUT36|Meanwhile, there's convenience.
NEUT37|We're already on Instagram.
NEUT38|I don't want to switch apps.
NEUT39|I don't want to learn a new interface.
NEUT40|I don't want to find something else.
NEUT41|I just keep it and keep it in house.
NEUT42|Keep it on Instagram so I don't have to learn anything and do it all in one place.
NEUT43|That convenience.
NEUT44|Well enable reels to overtake.
NEUT45|Tick tock.
NEUT46|As they go to short form video platform on the market because of all of these catalysts, I think that Instagram reels is going to follow on Instagram stories, footsteps and Spark.
BULL47|Meaningful outperformance across Facebook.
BULL48|Score operational metrics over the next 12 months and that will in turn spark meaningful outperformance in Facebook stock.
NEUT49|Could you see the stock?
NEUT50|Add another 100 bucks?
NEUT51|Absolutely.
NEUT52|So by now an hold 'cause this one is going higher.
NEUT53|Well, that's all we have for this edition of quick pics.
