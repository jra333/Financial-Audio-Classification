NEUT0|"""Let's start with what's going on in big tech before we move on to earnings."
BULL1|Amazon shares are up today.
BULL2|That's one of the reasons that the NASDAQ is higher.
NEUT3|It's a prime Day event or its prime days.
NEUT4|In this case, because it's today and tomorrow started at 3:00 AM Eastern.
NEUT5|Remember, this is an event that was moved from July when it typically happens amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
BULL6|JP Morgan estimates that Prime Day revenue will be up year over year 42% to about seven and a half billion dollars.
NEUT7|To put it in perspective, send seven half billion dollars.
NEUT8|From this event, the annual revenue of Amazon last year was 280 and a half billion dollars, including not, of course, just the retail operations, but Amazon Web Services and some of its other things as well.
NEUT9|Really.
NEUT10|Amazon uses this as a way to try to drive membership signups and membership revenue.
BULL11|Those customers tend to be more lucrative for the company, and E marketer estimates that US prime members will rise to 142 and a half million.
BEAR12|This year at the same time that this Prime Day event is happening, I should mention German Amazon workers are striking at 7 warehouses in that country to ask for better pay and working conditions.
NEUT13|Just something to mention in the background there and then.
BULL14|Finally, I also want to mention the stock is up about 78% year to date.
BULL15|That makes the price to earnings ratio on Amazon 132.
