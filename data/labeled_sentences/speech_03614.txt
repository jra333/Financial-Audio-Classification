NEUT1|Here at Walmart, swilley.
BEAR2|The stock I have for you today is 80 T. In the past, five days is dropped over 20% and we see this as a great buying opportunity.
NEUT3|The company is known for its home security system and give the stock a couple more days of cooling off before I buy because I see some additional downside, analysts are considering ADT, A by an low estimates are pricing it around $9.
NEUT4|The stock also pays a 1.84% dividend.
BEAR5|They've been consistently paying the stiffening now for two years.
NEUT6|The expiration for the dividend is March 17th.
NEUT7|If for nothing else, I say buy a couple shares.
NEUT8|You might make some money in the process and receive the dividend on top April 1st, and that's no joke.
BULL9|"With that, I'd like to say thank you for watching and hope to see you in another Morris money video."""
