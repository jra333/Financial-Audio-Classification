BULL0|"""Hey everyone, and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about sundial growers and one thing they asked me to understand.
BEAR2|This stock has been dropping.
BEAR3|It's a very hot penny stock.
BEAR4|It's been dropping for the past few days and it continues to drop today.
BEAR5|Literally dropping to as low as a dollar in 19 cents.
NEUT6|We're going to talk about this and if you enjoyed short video straight to the point, this drop a like subscribe and most importantly torontos post notifications.
BEAR7|OK so guys sundial growers yes and see that it's been dropping.
NEUT8|Right now a lot of people, yes and see it has a lot of volume.
NEUT9|173 million right now, which is a lot, you know compared to other times yes, and see for the past month.
BEAR10|It's also the same thing you know back in the beginning of this month, you know it was low and then you know mid way this month it started to go up and now dropping again.
NEUT11|So what is going on with this stock?
NEUT12|If you guys don't know I believe back then when this stock was going very fast.
NEUT13|Robin Hood also delisted this one and you weren't able to buy some.
NEUT14|Offer just a couple of hours.
NEUT15|Not the same with AMC or GameStop.
NEUT16|You know game science.
BEAR17|It was just done for like all day.
NEUT18|You couldn't buy, only sell.
NEUT19|So if you guys don't want that to happen to you, I recommend that we will guys get use my link down below.
NEUT20|I'm going away $50 to a random person that uses that.
NEUT21|You get 4 free stocks when you sign up and deposit $100 and these are the three songs that I received.
NEUT22|I got a $66 stock $30 stocks.
BEAR23|I just want to get away $50 to a random person once again the link is down below so.
NEUT24|What is going on with sundial growers guys?
NEUT25|It's very easy, very simple to understand.
NEUT26|This is what's going on.
NEUT27|OK, what does need to understand?
NEUT28|It says it literally right here.
NEUT29|OK, what they want to do is they want to create up to $800 million worth of new common stock and sell it.
NEUT30|Now what this company is saying right now is that they have experience.
BEAR31|You know volatility where you know their prices are literally it was as low as $0.14 a share.
BULL32|And went up to as high as almost $3.
NEUT33|And one thing is right.
NEUT34|This is very important.
NEUT35|OK, this is what they say.
NEUT36|No recent change in our financial condition or results of operations.
NEUT37|OK, so you need to understand that this stock is more of a, you know a risky stock where people just buy and sell.
NEUT38|It's not a stock that a lot of people are investing in as a long term.
NEUT39|So always keep that in mind.
NEUT40|This is more of a short term investment.
NEUT41|So at the moment.
BEAR42|It did drop, but of course you know they they want to, you know, create up to 800,000,000 worth of new common stock.
NEUT43|So I wouldn't be surprised you know if the price goes up again in the future, but at the moment you know it is dropping, so let me know what do you guys think about this, but I hope you guys enjoy.
NEUT44|"If you do give it a big thumbs up and I will see you guys in my next video."""
