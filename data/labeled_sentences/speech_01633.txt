NEUT0|"""We start with one hour chart."
NEUT1|Just want to give you a quick update.
NEUT2|OK, further analyzes when the price was here.
NEUT3|We mention exactly within this movie mentioned.
NEUT4|If you want to look for by we have to wait.
NEUT5|For correction, and as we can see, this is what we get and right now still what we have here is like we don't have a proper tree set up set up to look for.
NEUT6|Next trade OK. That's mean.
NEUT7|What do we have here is similar to what I explained.
NEUT8|My last analyzes OK, why do we still we can expect this one to turn to more complex correction before we get the next move.
NEUT9|That's why if you get this one, it was one more drop.
NEUT10|At least this one tend to move more complex.
NEUT11|Any River so we can look for buy, because if the price continue from here.
NEUT12|Even if you wait for the breakout of desktop, I think within this range we cannot get trade proper trade setup and even if my own in my analyzes we mentioned made this one turn to move similar to what I drove here as a corrective because we had this kind of the move based on it.
NEUT13|I mean for if you refer to the IPH charts, alright, that's why this one is still can tend to have one more bit more corrective before we get the next move.
NEUT14|All right now that things is, as I mentioned, whatever we have the same as what we will be analyzing my last.
NEUT15|Video no more changes and if you move to daily chart.
NEUT16|This is the only thing since we want to see whether this one can tend to more complex correction before we get the continuation or not.
NEUT17|Alright, that's me.
NEUT18|We have nothing to explain this on daily chart, and even if you move to forward chart.
NEUT19|We explained how we can look at this, either this one turned to similar to what we have here for running flat.
NEUT20|All even we mentioned about how this one we can look at it as an internal flood again.
NEUT21|Similar to what they explained in my last analyzes, the only things is what we're looking for.
NEUT22|We want to see what we get from here, whether we can, how deep this one can be, whether this one can retest this low or not, because it still we can expect this one.
NEUT23|Either start to drop from here or give us one move up, then start to drop this on turn to more complex correction.
NEUT24|Similar to what we have here, before we get the next move.
NEUT25|OK, and.
NEUT26|In this case, we move to one over chart.
BEAR27|As I mentioned, we don't have the proper trade setup is still we have to wait for to get this one and become more complex and still we can expect at least this one drop a bit more.
NEUT28|Before we get the next move, if the price drop, any reversal with a short move like we can look for trade with the break out of this stuff.
NEUT29|We start to manage.
NEUT30|Right, as I mentioned, this one can tend to internal correction for one more drop, we need to be aware of.
NEUT31|This possibility does mean even if we get any buy from here after the break out of the top.
NEUT32|If it is not moving, we shouldn't stable coming to visit rate, but if we see there is a continuation, we keep it alright, by the way.
NEUT33|We don't have.
NEUT34|Any trades adopt look for, sale, buy or sell any of them.
NEUT35|In this case, we just follow the chart we want to see how we just look at this.
NEUT36|We want to see how we can trade it.
NEUT37|I mean how complex can be in this case?
NEUT38|"If I see any update, I will share things."""
