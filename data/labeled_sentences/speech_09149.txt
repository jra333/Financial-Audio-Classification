NEUT0|"""Tech is an area that we really continue to like."
NEUT1|All of the moments you look at these cross asset.
NEUT2|Which asset classes in the driving seat?
NEUT3|At the moment equities or fixed income?
NEUT4|I think it's fixed income.
NEUT5|Now I think that equities has been in the driving seat and fixed income to me has now become the safe haven almost in a way that Golden even Bitcoin are becoming safe haven.
NEUT6|So it's like Patrick.
NEUT7|However, this discussion before the show, you know what is the floor now on the 10 year it could be 1%.
NEUT8|It just depends how far this thing goes.
NEUT9|I also think that a very good point was raised about the fact that this trade is a global.
NEUT10|Issue that is why the ECB is preparing to get a lot more dovish.
NEUT11|This is global.
NEUT12|The other thing that I would say though is that Trump score the thing that's been keeping the US economy going as being the consumer and they're about to probably pay 10% more for their iPhone in at the end of the year, so this is now becoming really serious, which is why I think that a resolution is required or this blows up win now at a binary situation, I think that's what a lot of people feel like it is looking at the markets right now.
NEUT13|The guys are under temp table mentioning tech.
NEUT14|Let's talk about tech, the semis and some Chinese names as well.
NEUT15|Want to bring in Bloomberg's Caroline?
NEUT16|Say Kylie hey Johnny, let's kick it off with some of those China tech heavyweights.
BEAR17|Alibaba is down about 3 1/2 percent here in early tradingandjd.com and buy do both.
BEAR18|Also, really under pressure to the tune of about 6 and 5% respectively.
NEUT19|That Golden dragon index.
BEAR20|Of course China companies listed in the US is down about 4.6%.
BEAR21|Could be its worst day since mid May.
NEUT22|And let's switch up the board.
NEUT23|Take a look at some of the semiconductors.
BEAR24|Of course the semiconductor index the Sox index on pace for its fifth consecutive day of losses.
BEAR25|Every single member of that index is lower this morning, but here's a look at some of the names really leading those losses.
BEAR26|Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA, Micron, Intel, all down to the tune of three to 5% John it's an ugly day for those chip stocks, which of course are very heavily exposed to China.
BEAR27|John Kelly, thank you, but it's only for the chip stocks except for the financials to about 8 minutes into the Session Bank of America down 3 1/2 percent, the sector getting pulled down by what is happening in the bond market.
NEUT28|Patrick, that's one thing you could predict.
NEUT29|Once you saw that move in Treasury yields, you knew what was coming for the financials, didn't you?
NEUT30|I mean, I think when people discuss trade, they often say I want to be other.
BEAR31|Domestically focused or internationally focused and banks are traditionally domestic play, but what's interesting is they also have tremendous interest rate sensitivity, and as we're experiencing this morning, interest rates are collapsing in response to not only the global slowdown, but also the trade discussion.
NEUT32|So in an interesting way, banks are one of the most exposed sectors to the trade disguise, so this is amazing because many people come on this program and say they have this utility time quality to them just in terms of business model, but just in terms of performance in the equity market, this might not be that defensive area of the market.
NEUT33|You hope it will be.
BULL34|If this then ramps up.
BEAR35|And escalates no.
NEUT36|I mean, if you're if you're seeing interest rates collapse, you need to play the true defensive yield sectors like utilities and REITs.
BEAR37|"But if you want to play domestic, don't do it in financials because you are going to get hosed."""
