BEAR0|"""Can we really expect the public to boycott Coca Cola classic just because the ad is highly ****** and insensitive to the emotional well being of the marginalized public?"
NEUT1|This arbitrator, group of Latin American teenage boys who are in very historical and architectural St since it's very narrow.
NEUT2|They are comparing this young tan shapely sensual silhouette.
NEUT3|Of a young Latin American woman to a Coca Cola bottle with very nice blast curves.
BULL4|Her body fits the Coca Cola bottle superbly.
NEUT5|It just they go wild, then they notice her mother.
BEAR6|Her mother is older, paler, less voluptuous by far, and they they hate this there.
NEUT7|Completely appalled, So what do they do?
NEUT8|They take a big two liter plastic cheap, cheap cheap plastic bottle and compare her mother.
BEAR9|To such an absurd size that makes the woman frustrated and upset, she's hurt.
NEUT10|That just shows the ideological value portrayed, which is that it's a male dominated and powerful society.
NEUT11|Since they have the power to sway a woman's opinion of her of her beauty and what she sees us herself.
NEUT12|Since this is an example since.
BEAR13|She's frowning, she's hurt.
NEUT14|She's easily going to go out and try and look as curvy as she can, so she can feel just like her daughter.
NEUT15|The social and economic status, economical status portrayed is generally middle class because.
NEUT16|They are not.
NEUT17|They are dressing very casual and their casual in conversation.
NEUT18|But they aren't impoverished.
NEUT19|Insert drinking Coca Cola.
NEUT20|They're having fun time, but they certainly are not wealthy since they're not being chauffeured around in big fancy limos and Hummers.
NEUT21|It's portraying that in order to be **** you must drink Coca Cola and then you'll be nice and curvy.
NEUT22|The only real words or text that's portrayed is Latin inspirational real.
NEUT23|The only thing that I got out of that was that it's saying that Latin American men are inspirational since they can get women to fit their personal ****** and physical needs.
NEUT24|And it just explains how beauty is way more important now in society, which in my opinion is very absurd and.
NEUT25|Should have no value.
NEUT26|In conclusion, this ad portrays the importance of physical beauty in society and how economic class and male dominated society and power.
NEUT27|"Are way too important in our society?"""
