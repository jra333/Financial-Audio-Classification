NEUT0|"""So let's talk valuation at it at its last private fundraising round in January, Roblox raised over 5,000,000 at $45.00."
NEUT1|Share going direct, listing a couple of weeks ago that $45.00 level was the reference point.
NEUT2|That was nice, but this thing exploded right out of the gate with the first trade coming at 6450.
NEUT3|Unusual for direct listing the darn thing spiked to 79 last Wednesday before pulling back through the high 60s late last week and then bounces 70 today at the current price and using Floyd Glue did share control.
NEUT4|Share Account in Roblox is being valued at about about.
NEUT5|About 45 billion because there's so much of their money comes from subscription.
NEUT6|I think it makes sense to judge this stock on a price to booking space is not price to book, but bookings based on limited analyst covers the Wall Street consensus for the company generated 2.7 billion in bookings this year, meaning Roblox trades it a little less than 17 times next year's bookings.
NEUT7|Pretty expensive but still mine was something like Snap or an A lot cheaper than Unity software may be the closest comparison and one that is taking a lot of millennials by storm.
NEUT8|You ever talk to Millennials and I do.
NEUT9|They always like unity software.
NEUT10|This is better, but it only gather you got my blessing to put on a position in Roblox right now, right here, although I'd like it, of course, at a much lower level.
NEUT11|But this is the real deal.
NEUT12|If it keeps climbing though, I wouldn't pay more than 8350 for this one, which is roughly 20 times next year's bookings.
NEUT13|At least not until we get more visibility into how they see the rest of the year playing out the bottom line, Roblox could have a very choppy year once the economy fully reopened, so as much as I like this story, please don't buy it unless you're prepared for some turbulence when that happens.
BULL14|That said, this is a good one.
BULL15|I think it's worth it to weather impossible Storm.
NEUT16|And I recommend buying some right here and buy some for your kids.
NEUT17|Then you could buy more on the way down, but only if you share my conviction.
BULL18|You've done the work and you realize how incredible these key financial metrics really, really are.
