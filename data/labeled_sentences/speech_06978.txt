BULL0|"""New this morning, Piper Jaffray's Michael Olsen out with a note making the case for Amazon stock to reach $3000 in the next two to three years."
BULL1|That would be an increase of more than 60% from today's levels.
NEUT2|Joining us right now in the Squawk News line.
BULL3|Michael Olson, who is senior analyst at Piper Jaffray Michael, thank you for being with us this morning.
NEUT4|What gets you to this conclusion?
NEUT5|Yeah, what we're really doing here is making a valuation argument that if you split Amazon up into three major segments, which would be the core retail segment, a WS, an advertising, and then apply something close to a comp group.
NEUT6|Average multiple two 2022 estimates for each of those segments.
NEUT7|Then you arrive at a share price of about $3000 in about two years, or in mid 2021 when investors will begin to start trading the stock off of 2022 estimates.
NEUT8|What?
NEUT9|What are the risks though?
NEUT10|I mean, there are so many things that are swirling with Amazon right now, with the idea of regulators potentially getting involved with a lot of big technology names with the idea of just the President, president not particularly caring for the founder, Jeff Bezos.
NEUT11|How do you kind of factor in any of those risks?
NEUT12|Or do you?
BULL13|We do factor in the risks by using a relatively conservative growth rates as well as what we believe to be conservative multiples, and in particular you know Amazon's core retail segment is growing more than four times faster than the brick and mortar comparative companies.
BULL14|Interestingly though, if we use a slow growth brick and mortar comp group multiple on Amazon's core retail business, it suggests upside from where the stock currently is.
BEAR15|So in other words, investors are currently valuing at Amazon's retail segment below a brick and mortar multiple, even though it's.
BULL16|Growing so much faster than that, brick and mortar comp group.
NEUT17|So that's just one example of how we believe there's conservatism in our analysis, and that bakes in, you know, some of the concerns that people may have.
NEUT18|You talk about the potential for a spin-off of Amazon Web Services.
NEUT19|How likely do you think that is?
NEUT20|You know it's it's really hard to say, and we honestly don't have a good read on whether or not that that could happen or not, but I guess I would just say that there's really no reason that those two businesses need to be combined with one another.
BULL21|That could appease some of the regulator concern and ultimately it would be a good thing in this case because it would sort of unlock the realization of value for each segment.
NEUT22|What happens if there's an economic slowdown?
BEAR23|Some sort of a recession in the United States between here and then?
NEUT24|With that impact, Amazon?
NEUT25|Or because it's in the online sales portion of things, you think it's immune to anything like that?
NEUT26|I don't think it's immune.
NEUT27|It would definitely have an impact, and that's that's probably, you know, outside of regulatory or other risk.
NEUT28|That's probably the biggest concern.
BULL29|Is some sort of macro slowdown impacting the core retail segment, so definitely not immune, but at the same time kind of riding the rising tide of secular tailwinds of offline to online growth will help to offset that to some degree.
NEUT30|Your price target just for the next 12 months is $2255.00, so that's a lot of room to run in 12 months too.
NEUT31|Yeah, we we believe there's a lot of room to run in 12 months or 24 months and it really comes down to kind of the same conclusion, which is that if you look at each segment of the business and apply a reasonable multiple again, we're not asking for significant premiums to what kind of some of the comparative group averages are?
BULL32|You end up at a share price that's significantly higher than where we are today.
NEUT33|Are you the highest price target on the street?
NEUT34|I don't believe our 12 month price target is the highest, but I'm not 100% sure on that.
BULL35|Michael want to thank you for joining us today.
NEUT36|Michael Wilson.
BULL37|"Thank you."""
