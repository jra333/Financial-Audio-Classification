BULL0|"""Hey there everybody."
NEUT1|Jason Moser here with Brendan Matthews joining you for another edition of Ask a fool and today we're taking a question from Picante men like Picante sauce Brendan, Me Too.
NEUT2|OK so picante man asks us is there a reason to sell?
NEUT3|GOOG shares Jyoji to sell those shares of Google and by the Google shares GOOGL did I miss something here in Picante is talking about the the recent stock split.
NEUT4|That Google just went through that.
NEUT5|Let's just be Frank here.
NEUT6|I mean, it's kind of annoying stock split up from a paper work perspective at least, but but what do you think?
NEUT7|So, in theory, the reason that you'd want to sell GOOG, which are the Class C shares, is because the other class, the Class A shares Geo GL have voting rights, whereas the jioji do not have voting rights.
NEUT8|But I would say to most investors it's probably not worth the hassle of selling.
NEUT9|So first of all, most people, if you help Google for any period of time, you probably have some capital gains there.
NEUT10|If you if you sell, you're going to trigger long term capital gains tax or short term capital gains tax depending on how long you've held it, you're going to incur the commissions and trading costs, and I don't really see the compelling reason to do it.
NEUT11|You know, as a small shareholder, you're probably not going to be influencing Google.
NEUT12|You know what's going to happen at Google One way or the other.
NEUT13|So and the stocks have tracked very closely together so far they might diverge a little bit, but I would.
NEUT14|I would just stay put.
NEUT15|Yeah, you know, I think that you make a great point about.
NEUT16|On one hand, I like being able to.
NEUT17|Make my voice heard and vote my shares, but by the same token I mean this stock split essentially was done in such a way to keep the power of the company and the Founders hands to begin with.
BULL18|So yeah, I agree with you.
NEUT19|I think that even if you got to vote it really in the end wouldn't matter other than to be able to say that you did actually go through the process and vote, right?
NEUT20|So yeah, I think they were saying makes perfect sense sometimes in investing.
NEUT21|One of the things I love about investing is oftentimes the best course of action is to do nothing.
NEUT22|So, and that's why I think in this case that's good stuff, alright.
BULL23|Well, thanks, a lot Brendan.
NEUT24|Thank you for the question.
