NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol Mara."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context, but a very very impressive bounce on the day when you think about the fact that at one point the price had been all the way down here and now it's been able to battle back up to where it has now.
BULL5|Yeah, there's still a lot more work that needs to be done, but point being from where the price was to was able to battle back up to very impressive movement.
NEUT6|Which brings, but now the valid question of but is there any sort of true power behind this president?
NEUT7|Is there any sort of genuine strength, or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT8|Dead Cat Bounce, site move and I have no idea.
NEUT9|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward in my mind intervals on a single area.
BEAR10|In that area is sits down here at the $27.00 mark.
NEUT11|Now why is 27 important and helpful?
NEUT12|And I'm not saying that this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake, let's say the price comes down here.
NEUT13|27 behave in that manner and then continues on down.
NEUT14|What would you have at that point?
NEUT15|You would quite literally have the price having gone right back to where it was.
NEUT16|And I mean not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT17|But price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sound true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT18|Now on the flip side, and to be fair, I mean no pricing, just go straight up either.
NEUT19|So maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner and then start to curl itself back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right there, you have loads down there, and if you envision each of those at stair steps, well, hey, there we go.
NEUT21|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction and that's the name of the game.
BULL22|That's what it truly strong we were going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT23|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 27 in terms of levels of resistance, all is going to be on that purple line right there.
NEUT24|The very well known, the very famous 50.
NEUT25|Moving average current value of that is right up around, we'll call it 3325.
NEUT26|So keep a close eye on that moving forward.
NEUT27|But yeah, anyway, you look at it.
BULL28|Impressive bounce.
NEUT29|Not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward?
NEUT30|Let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again.
NEUT41|Totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT42|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT43|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT44|If you have any questions let me know.
