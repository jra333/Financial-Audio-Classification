BEAR0|"""Second quarter GDP figures show that the US economy shrank at a slower pace than expected, but the personal consumption reading dropped 1.2%, much worse than expected."
NEUT1|For more on what these numbers say about the state of the US economy, we're joined right now by the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Christina Romer.
BULL2|Hi Madam Chairman, always glad to speak with you.
BEAR3|We did see that 1% drop in the headline GDP figure, but some say it could have been worse.
BULL4|I mean, government consumption increase of 5.6%.
BULL5|There was a massive boost from defense.
BEAR6|So without these two elements, would you say the headline number would have been worse?
NEUT7|No question, and I again I've been listening to a lot of the same private forecasters that you are, and they say that the fiscal stimulus bill that was passed probably was adding somewhere between two and three percentage points to the growth rate of GDP.
NEUT8|So that gives you a sense of just how much worse this would have been had it not been for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
NEUT9|And of course, all the other things that we and the Federal Reserve have done to try to rescue this economy.
BULL10|It does seem like the GDP sets us up for an improvement as far as inventory goes as far as trade goes.
BEAR11|But it still indicates that the average American, the US consumer, is struggling.
NEUT12|How worried do you remain about that component?
BEAR13|Well, I I do think it's important to put it in perspective, because you're right, the the consumption numbers took down a little bit this quarter, but of course both in the first quarter in the second quarter, those numbers are so much better than we had seen in the third and fourth quarter of last year.
BULL14|So I think we are seeing some sign that the consumer is stabilizing.
NEUT15|And of course, the tax cut that was included in the Recovery Act we.
BULL16|Absolutely think is going to help make consumers feel somewhat more confident.
NEUT17|I'd also point out those business investment numbers.
BEAR18|That's really the big change that you see from the first of the second quarter that had been just plummeting and now it's falling at a much more moderate rate.
NEUT19|And that's a big part of why we've seen this moderation in the rate of decline.
NEUT20|It's Betty here.
NEUT21|Let me just jump in really quickly because I want to step back from the economy and talk about some other news we were discussing this morning, which is the cash for clunkers program.
BEAR22|Maybe I've seen as a success because we saw so much participation, but some say it's a fiasco because you ran out of money.
NEUT23|So you know the important thing that I want to say is the program is still in effect.
NEUT24|It has not been suspended.
NEUT25|Our legislative folks want you to know if you want to go out and buy a car this weekend.
BULL26|It's still in effect, and I can tell you, there's a big flurry of activity here to try to make sure we have the funding to keep it going, because as you pointed out, it is a success.
BULL27|It is a sign that people want to go back and buy cars, and so this is certainly something that would help those consumers that you were talking about.
NEUT28|Get back to spending Madam Chairman.
BULL29|We thank you as always for your time.
