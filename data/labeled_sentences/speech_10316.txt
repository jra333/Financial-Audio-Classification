BULL0|"""And look, I will pack Gelsinger is terrific and it was great that he came over from where an Intel was rudderless."
NEUT1|It takes a long time to turn around the ship.
NEUT2|I think that that pattern is spreading the gospel.
BEAR3|But look, we haven't lost anybody.
NEUT4|Everybody loves us and we're going to be taking chair.
NEUT5|But what I really didn't like about this this was a straw man piece of research.
BEAR6|The blue Sky upside scenario of $5 earnings per share is it's going to melt away.
NEUT7|No, wait, a second.
NEUT8|I have.
BEAR9|I've been the most bullish Kyle and AMD.
NEUT10|In the world, ever since five, I never once believed in the blue Sky.
NEUT11|Scenario 5 bucks you if you want to create a straw man David and then say hey listen, it's not going to happen.
NEUT12|That's what happened there that peace that peace David that guy's been wrong about AMD for a long time.
NEUT13|OK well let's just make him longer or more wrong.
NEUT14|Or wrong are I always like that?
NEUT15|It's probably more.
BULL16|I think it's an increase, probably a sweet, happy, nice.
NEUT17|What about the idea that they both can benefit?
NEUT18|Is that a possibility in your mind or does one have to benefit at the as the zero sum?
NEUT19|Yeah, at the loss of the other, well, I think if you listen to at least as Sue said, and perhaps this gentleman did the other day when she spoke its multi year partnerships.
NEUT20|OK, and they're very hard once you're in to rip out.
NEUT21|And I'm talking bout Google.
NEUT22|I'm talking bout Azure alright consent?
NEUT23|These companies are big.
NEUT24|And they are siding with AMD, so I'm a God's will for Intel to come back, but I think that piece is another reason why you should buy AMD and that because enough.
BULL25|I had enough.
BULL26|It's the only dollar Gen that's good.
NEUT27|Yeah, well, if I wanted to talk about it, but we're going to in a minute, but let Carl tell us about the opening Bell here.
NEUT28|Well, I don't have much to add guys that the except that that is the Bell and the SNP.
NEUT29|I do want to quickly point out before we get going here Jim, that the banks are clearly going to lead.
NEUT30|I think the top 1015 maybe 20 SNP leaders are all financial related.
NEUT31|We did have the twos 10 spread, get back to the highest since 2015 Jim and I'm just looking at Philly fed.
NEUT32|Prices paid.
NEUT33|75 nine on prices paid Philly fed.
NEUT34|That's the highest going back to March of 1980.
BULL35|Yeah, so these pressures may be transient, but they're going to be.
BULL36|They're going to be elevated even if their transient.
NEUT37|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT38|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
