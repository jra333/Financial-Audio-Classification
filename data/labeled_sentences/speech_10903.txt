NEUT0|"""OK, traders in Wall Street, veterans out there giving guys my rundown of what's going to happen in the weekend."
NEUT1|So a little recap about Friday.
BEAR2|You know it was like your average everyday really bad day.
BULL3|Anna suddenly shot all the way up.
NEUT4|Two $270 on spy and I've never seen this before.
NEUT5|Even Warren Buffett said he's never seen this before, and he's a pretty, you know, long time trader.
NEUT6|An right now you can see here the markets.
NEUT7|There's a lot less bad news.
NEUT8|It's mostly news, are neutral or a combination of good and bad.
NEUT9|You can see here markets, you know they're kind of iffy.
BEAR10|They're not stable at all, but Trump is really pumping the markets.
NEUT11|And for the first time, when you and you type in Corona virus on the news, there's actually some decent things.
NEUT12|At the coronavirus light, how there's much better testing going on.
BULL13|White House is given aid packages and you know things are starting to look OK here and there.
BULL14|Now if you check out South Korea's coronavirus, they're actually doing a fantastic job on containing it, and China and South Korea seems like the only way to contain this virus.
BULL15|There are models are doing good, it's proven so far to be one of the best and South Korea.
NEUT16|China.
NEUT17|Gotta give major credit to them.
NEUT18|They are honestly controlling it very very well with China.
NEUT19|Sending teams of doctors too.
BULL20|Italy also, South Korea send their own teams of doctors as well to Europe to make sure Europe is handling coronavirus better as well.
BULL21|So right now at least, South Korea is recovering their reporting more recoveries than coronavirus cases for the first time and things are looking better and better.
NEUT22|Currently you've got companies out there like Guild.
NEUT23|They're trying to get vaccine for the coronavirus ASAP.
BULL24|They're starting treatments for coronavirus patients, have severe like lung problems, and hopefully those will work as well.
NEUT25|And right now Trump is offering, you know, a lot of incentives.
NEUT26|He's also slashing on student loans, helping the students as well an right now, President Trump is also know considering domestic travel restrictions, and you may be wondering, aren't restrictions bad for the stock market wanted tank?
BULL27|Honestly, if Trump is putting all these different measures and also things to really calm people down like a package is free coronavirus testing in slashing rates here and there, it will actually give confidence to some investors.
NEUT28|Some people honestly feel like this could be the bottom and start buying U.S. stocks.
NEUT29|So Monday it's going to be very, very wild day and neck St in general is going to be super super crazy, so my opinion is it could be green on Monday and then read Tuesday and so forth.
NEUT30|It's going to be a combination and no one really knows what's going up or down.
NEUT31|Honestly, it's going to be 5050% chance this market is absolutely stupid.
NEUT32|I have no clue it's going on, but my guess is it's most likely going to be a bold day on Monday.
BULL33|But there's also a pretty decent high chance.
NEUT34|Of a bear Monday.
BULL35|Then again, the market did respond extremely well when Trump said he will be.
NEUT36|You know, having this state of emergency, you know free Corona testing stuff like that.
BULL37|It gave investors a lot of confidence and that's why I shot up the after hours do look a little bit lousy.
BULL38|But then again, you did have one of the most insane gains, so we may be seeing investors reinvesting money and money on Monday.
NEUT39|But I'm not really sure, so definitely make sure to cover positions by put an by calls.
NEUT40|So if you lose, you don't lose that bad and lose your pants.
NEUT41|That's about it.
BULL42|"Thanks watching Ankon blow."""
