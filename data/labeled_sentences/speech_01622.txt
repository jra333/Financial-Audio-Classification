BULL0|"""Skinny in a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 17th of every 2021.
NEUT2|Wednesday, the day of the week we're at #18 Bitcoin SV with particular BSV.
BEAR3|So for BSV against busy things are not looking good.
NEUT4|If you were in BSV.
NEUT5|I mean if you were in BTC all along you would affect so much better than if you were to be in PSV recolors of what you think about the fundamentals.
NEUT6|If you had your money in BTC, you do so much better, right?
BULL7|And so yeah, there was a spike they came in, but then this wasn't a particularly strong spike and it feels to me like BSV is forming a.
NEUT8|Descending triangle, right?
BULL9|This is a potentially right.
BEAR10|No guarantees very one sorry Mountain, one mountain to mountain tree Palm BSV could be dropping lower for the PSV BDC pair, so be very careful about going to trade too soon, right?
BEAR11|There was a spider came in against USD, but then again, this losing Satoshis against BTC right?
BEAR12|There could be a spike coming in.
NEUT13|We could go towards the skinny pink line, but I just don't see it right now.
NEUT14|There is still no clear bullish moves coming in for BSV.
BEAR15|BTC at this point of time I wish I could say that things are going to turn bullish in the next day, but I can't because there's just no tradeable chart patterns, no clear signs of bullishness for BSV against BC.
BEAR16|We're still a distance away from the snipping claim, and as long as we are below the sleeping client, we shall remain bias bearish for BSV against BTC.
BULL17|Alright, let's move on to be against USD.
NEUT18|But before that please give this video a like.
NEUT19|If you enjoyed it, subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about BSV in the comments below for BSV against USD.
BEAR20|We've been saying that there is a potential that could be a fall coming on for BSV BSV wheels.
BEAR21|We will shenanigans and the PSV Wills could be pulling the price level.
NEUT22|Eating up everybody's stop sell before going back up, but to be honest this is actually very encouraged because it would create a very high quality symmetrical triangle, right and symmetrical triangles more likely than not on such a scale is towards the upside.
NEUT23|If it happens, great.
NEUT24|If it doesn't happen, yeah, too bad, but it's just that you know right now for BSV against Jersey.
NEUT25|There is still no tradeable Chuck better.
NEUT26|There's just no tradeable shop, it's just we are aware of the dangers of a pull towards the downside dangers of everybody's stop cells.
BEAR27|Around this area being eaten up right with the Super pull down so.
NEUT28|Be careful about going to a trade too soon.
NEUT29|Alright?
NEUT30|I guess that's it for my BSV technical analysis.
BULL31|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL32|I hope you enjoyed it.
