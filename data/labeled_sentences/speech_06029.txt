NEUT0|"""It's August the 11th trading is over on Wall Street."
NEUT1|Here's the New York minute.
BEAR2|It's sizzling outside in New York, and it's also sizzling in the stock market.
NEUT3|All the three traditional industries people look at are at all time highs, but with the catalysts.
BULL4|Well, first of all, look at Department store stocks roaring back into favor today, but not necessarily for the most positive reasons.
BEAR5|Macy's announced it was cutting back more than 100 branches, and that was regarded as positive news on the market.
BULL6|After the belt Nordstrom announced earnings that were better than expected.
NEUT7|But on sales.
BEAR8|That had actually fallen the other big catalyst was the oil prices.
BULL9|You can see it's rose very significantly through the morning after you heard comments from Saudi Arabia suggesting they do want to try to manage the oil price once more.
NEUT10|Any suggestion of an active OPEC once more is positive as far as the oil prices concerns, but take a look at where US inventories still stand.
BEAR11|That is a huge overhang of supply and earlier in the day the IEA had warned that growth in demand.
BULL12|Would be slowing.
NEUT13|"There is still a long way to go for the oil price and that's the New York Minute."""
