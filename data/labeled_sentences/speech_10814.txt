NEUT0|"""Hey guys and welcome to channel in this video I'm going to be talking about Mara."
NEUT1|If you guys have filed a channel for some time and all that Mars is one of my favorite stocks and I think they're going to have a huge week this week, so stick around.
NEUT2|But before we get into the video, if you are interested, there will be a link in the description to join the Discord.
NEUT3|Now onto my thoughts.
BULL4|If you look at Mara and how they're set up, they have some really good profit margins on the cost of each Bitcoin they mind and looking ahead into the future, I think tomorrow will be far better than Riot in the long run, as once the companies new miners that they ordered arrive and are completely set up, they'll have by far the best minors available on the market.
BULL5|The stock didn't have that great of a week last week, but I'm expecting this week to be very good for Mara and I said that if Bitcoin stays above 37 K and if it's above 37 K at market open tomorrow, I'm expecting this stock history up to around $25.
NEUT6|As far as my price predictions for the long run, a lot of it's going to depend on what Bitcoin does.
BULL7|Bless you guys.
NEUT8|Know some of my rough estimates at where I think more would be based on Bitcoins price this year.
BULL9|I think if we see Bitcoin reach 100K this year, we could see my around $80.00 and if we were to see Bitcoin rich 150K.
NEUT10|I think tomorrow would be well over $100 a share.
NEUT11|Overall, I think the thought process is that if you think Bitcoin is going to rise in the future and even hit some of these crazy, price is like 500K.
NEUT12|As some of these people have predicted, Can you imagine what price tomorrow will be at that price?
NEUT13|For Bitcoin we could see more at over 250 to $300.
NEUT14|Overall I think you see my point, I'm super bullish on it, so I think it might be a little biased, but.
NEUT15|I think most people expect Bitcoin to rise, so if we see that happened.
BULL16|I expect to see more arise with it.
NEUT17|I just think these new miners are they ordered a while back.
BULL18|Once they're set up and completely ready to go, it's going to be a game changer and I think the stock is going to be the best one in the long run.
NEUT19|It was like continue to say even at these prices for Bitcoin.
BEAR20|I think more is still very undervalued.
BEAR21|So overall, I expect the stock DEF.
NEUT22|Some ups and downs as every other stock does, but I think this is going to be a big winner, but what do you guys think about this stock?
NEUT23|Do you think we could see $30 this week?
NEUT24|Let me know down below.
NEUT25|"Personally, I'm looking for us to reach around 27 or $28.00 by the end of the week and remember this isn't financial advice, it's just for entertainment purposes only."""
