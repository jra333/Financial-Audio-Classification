NEUT0|"""Hi everyone, I'm going to review an easy profitable trade I took this morning in Netflix."
NEUT1|And I'll highlight the factors that made this a high probability trade and trade that worked.
NEUT2|On the chart, I have three moving averages, the 20 SMAD in Gray, the 200 S ma in yellow.
NEUT3|Any eight year may in blue.
NEUT4|I always had moving averages up on my charts that indicate the direction and strength of price momentum.
NEUT5|If there is any.
NEUT6|And since this is a day trade, I also have the energy levels drawn based on the last two days of price activity.
BEAR7|And since this has been an area of weakness, they are drawn from the low of the last two days to the high of the last two days.
BULL8|In this trade I bought shares of Netflix at the retest of yesterday's low.
NEUT9|It coincided with today's low is important to note that yesterday's low of 215 to 1252 matches up with this federal level here.
NEUT10|When buying shares at an area of potential support, I always want to see that at least 2 technical signs are indicating that it's an area of potential support.
BULL11|And here I've got both a Fable level an yesterday's low to work with.
NEUT12|I traded this on the 15 minute timeframe.
NEUT13|This green candle here at 10:15.
BULL14|Found support back in the area of yesterday's low and this fit level at two 1253.
NEUT15|And it pushes all the way up and closes up here.
BEAR16|At the close of this candle, I take a long position at 213 seventy with a stop loss just below the low of the day where it found support.
NEUT17|An my first profit target is at the next area of potential resistance, which is.
NEUT18|Up at 2:14 eighty.
NEUT19|And once I have my first bit of profit taking up there, my stop loss gets moved to break.
BEAR20|Even so that on the remainder of the position I've taken the risk completely off of this trade.
NEUT21|Beyond there, I have a choice of taking the rest of my profit.
NEUT22|Perhaps at the next fifth level of resistance, which is two 1567.
NEUT23|Or I may hold on further.
BULL24|In this case I held on longer because of the strong slope of the AMA and because the market in general was having a very strong morning, I held on up to the next fifth level at two sixteen 37.
NEUT25|That coincides with yesterday's high of the day, right around that area.
NEUT26|So it's the perfect place to take the rest of my profit off.
NEUT27|Notice that the price did continue beyond there, but I'm not trying to call an exact high.
NEUT28|I just want to get the clearest, highest probability, profit and move on to the next trade.
NEUT29|"Let me know if you have any comments or questions and thanks for watching."""
