BULL0|"""Hey son, investors and welcome back to another video."
NEUT1|Today we're going to talk about this is actually a ETF.
NEUT2|It is not a stalker, not focused on stocks, but I want to focus more on ETS Real estate index funds.

NEUT11|OK so let's talk about UCO tickers you see?
NEUT12|Oh OK, yes can see that this is the ETF has to do with crude oil and I actually have one share an.
NEUT13|Maybe I can show you guys.
NEUT14|Yes, I bought this share back in May.
NEUT15|I mean March?
NEUT16|I mean wow I bought this back in April 27, 2020.
NEUT17|I bought it at 12:50.
NEUT18|Absolutely crazy.
NEUT19|I bought it at 12:50 and look at this.
NEUT20|I averaged 12:50 and I've made a profit of $16.00 and I don't even think you know like this was back then when I barely started and not even know anything.
NEUT21|I didn't even know this was the ETF.
NEUT22|If you guys don't know they've had splits before reverse splits as well.
NEUT23|So from the looks of it.
NEUT24|You know, a lot of people when they look at this or like wow, you know this used to be like you know, like $1000 back then.
NEUT25|Yeah, just keep in mind that they always had splits, reverse splits and it gets confusing.
NEUT26|Especially someone as a beginner.
NEUT27|For me.
NEUT28|You know when I looked at this I'm like what this is, how much it was before in the drop to this low, you know.
NEUT29|So always keep that in mind.
NEUT30|So in my opinion, no.
NEUT31|By just analyzing how well they've been doing for the past three months, the highest they've gone is like around somewhere like in the 30s.
NEUT32|Like 35 you can see right over here.
NEUT33|Somewhere around that area that was back in August and in a huge crash dropping down and you can see that.
NEUT34|Right now it's back at 29, so this is definitely one of those ETF's that it probably won't even like recover from for like a very long time.
NEUT35|But it's definitely something that I mean.
NEUT36|I bought us a beginner.
NEUT37|I mean made $16.00 profit.
NEUT38|Not that bad, but let me know down in the comments section below.
