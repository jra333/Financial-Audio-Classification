BULL0|"""Good morning, welcome to Goodwill."
NEUT1|In this video presentation we will see how we can trade in FT index futures and options today.
BULL2|Yesterday the price opens up many of 14,780.
BULL3|Right after the opening, the market had very good momentum on the buying side, so went up there.
BULL4|Look 14,920, found some resistance averagely it went up and found some resistance around 40,920 and closed near 14,888.
NEUT5|Today it's expected open somewhere in and around putting those 920.
BEAR6|So again, the price is going to open near the key resistance because we had seen so many times the market had failed from 14,420.
BULL7|But still, we believe that the market will be good for buying.
BULL8|So go for buying till 14,860 by placing stop at 14,840 expecting the price to move up and hit various target mark.
NEUT9|This possible resistance are today we have weekly expiry in the options market so we are moving to the next weekly options which is going to expire on 15th of next week are so 14,900.
NEUT10|Where is this?
NEUT11|Yes putting those 900 will be the admin option.
NEUT12|You can select foot in those.
BEAR13|15,100 strike we're going somewhere out of money, little bit deep out of money since Saturday is the expiring weekly expiry.
NEUT14|Wait for the price to come near 65 or 60.
BULL15|Then go for buying this circle option with some 2530 points drop expecting the value of the premium to increase when the underlying asset increases.
NEUT16|So let us see what's going to happen during the trading session.
