NEUT2|OK, let's bring the visitor to front.
NEUT3|This is a monthly timeframe.
NEUT4|As you can see here.
BULL5|The ticker is says M. That means that every single kind of stick represent a month of time we're expecting price to break all time highs again after reaching this very strong after minus pointed out in previous analysis.
NEUT6|So if you are sort of a breakout trader, maybe you could start buying the breakout.
NEUT7|We don't do that on when training.
NEUT8|And we wait for the placement.
NEUT9|So if price or rallies we will wait for retracement.
NEUT10|This is our long term analysis.
NEUT11|This is a mountain time frame.
NEUT12|Most people won't even look at this time frame.
NEUT13|So this is where we are.
NEUT14|All we are expecting.
BULL15|We're starting price Lisa Stark to break Automise are $250 per share break higher, uncreative niirs demand that we will be willing to buy or a big arbitration.
NEUT16|But looks like with the strength of this bullish candle.
NEUT17|A few days left for the monthly conduct close.
BULL18|This is going to keep on rolling and break higher, like the S&P and the NASDAQ index is D and so did spy index as well.
NEUT19|So long by some visa, remember that you can use more time friends and take advantage of these long term timeframe analysis using supply and demand imbalances to place trades for shorter term for intraday even scalping visa and stock whatever stocks you want to trade.
NEUT20|You can use options, strategies, and bullish option strategies in this occasion.
BEAR21|Obviously trying to use our selling strategy or bearish strategy on options right now is a little bit of sort of a suicidal think, so waiting expecting price to break higher on this.
NEUT22|And let's see what happens.
NEUT23|It did happen.
NEUT24|What we expected here.
NEUT25|It just kissed the level like it did on Microsoft, Tesla, Apple and many others.
NEUT26|And then prices rallied.
NEUT27|All this is the coffee.
BEAR28|19 pandemic shattering the stock market.
NEUT29|Quote unquote and then we are expecting that.
NEUT30|All the logs are allowed.
