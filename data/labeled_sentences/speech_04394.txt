NEUT0|"""And joining us right now to talk more about it as Steph Wissink, a research analyst at Jefferies and Stuff we didn't have much time to look through these numbers, but there's a lot to kind of digest."
NEUT1|What Courtney was just talking about with raising the average wage that they have their two above $15.00 an hour making $14 billion in investments.
NEUT2|And I think it's interesting if you look at the investments that they're talking about.
NEUT3|They say it's to build the supply chain capacity and automation to stay ahead of demand raises.
NEUT4|A lot of questions on its own.
NEUT5|What do you think just?
NEUT6|At first blush.
BULL7|I concur with Courtney's assessment.
BEAR8|I think this is a little bit of a mixed bag this morning.
BULL9|Clearly the headline number on comp was very strong and actually it was across all of their operating units.
BULL10|Even Sam's Club saw a nice comp in the quarter with membership group growth of almost 13% as well.
BULL11|So I think all all of the indications around the health of the top line seemed to be pretty strong.
BULL12|To your point, it does seem like Walmart is taking this opportunity with the tailwind of Covid increased proximity to the consumer and continuing to be that destination for consumers to really amp up.
NEUT13|Their investment spend to make sure that they are competitive and that they can meet consumer demand.
NEUT14|I do think it's interesting as well.
NEUT15|Putting right in the top headlines of the release.
BULL16|That commitment to wages, and I think your Walmart in many respects does set the standard and so we're going to look at how this might affect retail more broadly with a higher minimum wage to $15 on average across the US.
NEUT17|They say if I remember several years ago, this is going back.
NEUT18|Must be 4 for almost five years now when Doug Mcmillon came out and said that he was going to be investing in the stores and investing in the people and raising wages.
BEAR19|And it came as a bit of a shock to Wall Street.
BEAR20|He said that in an Investor Day and when the street found out how much it was going to cost, it took the stock down pretty significantly.
NEUT21|This seems like another moment where Doug Mcmillon is saying we're going to be doing these investments.
NEUT22|You would think he maybe won some credibility with investors based on his last investments and how they paid off.
NEUT23|It really made the company being a position.
NEUT24|Being ready to kind of pivot much more to online sales.
NEUT25|What do you think this time around?
NEUT26|Yeah, I think it's probably something similar.
NEUT27|Again, I think Walmart sets the standard across retail and it is in many cases the biggest employer is Courtney mentioned in some small communities as well.
BEAR28|So we know that there is a flywheel effect as wages go up.
BULL29|Spending power goes up in many of these local markets, so I do think Walmart is probably somewhat of a beneficiary on the backside as well in terms of higher sales and better opportunity.
NEUT30|I also think to Corey's point.
NEUT31|Earlier to Walmart is investing in other areas of the business that aren't necessarily directly related to the store footprint, so we're looking at things like health care.
NEUT32|Are tide to the stores, but are an appendage or an adjacency to that investing in media investing in advertising and advertising platform for their vendors?
NEUT33|So there are some other counter effects that could develop.
BULL34|Maybe that would be somewhat different than five years ago that could help to defray some of the headwind from rising wage and also rising investment.
NEUT35|So I do think there are some some counter points that we need to give some attention to today.
NEUT36|I would expect the Investor Day is going to focus on some of those as well to help, kind of lateralized.
NEUT37|Some of the effect of some of the rising investment that they're doing.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
