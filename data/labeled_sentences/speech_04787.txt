BULL0|"""We've got strong conviction here."
NEUT1|We've got the investment.
NEUT2|Pros, Matt, Jim and Scotty.
NEUT3|Dominant developer ease otherness?
NEUT4|Being pulled out.
NEUT5|Jim is just to end the incompetence down there, and I do believe it's in having a direct impact.
NEUT6|You know, like we all ask her kids, or in my case nieces nephews to get along and reach across the aisle.
NEUT7|They're not doing down in DC.
NEUT8|I do want to say though, household net worth spike more as increased more and then over a year.
NEUT9|So get ready when the good weather comes.
NEUT10|I do believe there's some pent up demand and I think you're going to see this was Jonathan saying although it does feel like it's somewhat by for kated you know that went outdoors I went indoors.
NEUT11|I went with Tronic arts.
BULL12|They have a massive sports title there year over year growth in that area over 80%.
BULL13|I do think they were best rapid growth.
NEUT14|They're managing their expenses.
NEUT15|I like them a lot.
NEUT16|I think more people are going to sit in from their computers or.
NEUT17|Their video games and keep on plugging along well then we thought they were going through the roof, but they are real.
NEUT18|Companies were real earnings.
NEUT19|Real real sales, real profits.
NEUT20|So at the end of the day, I agree with your dominant, but I think it is also different today versus 2000 is a lot of value which Charles was talking about is being extracted pre IPO.
NEUT21|There is a much more mature market for private shares trading for investments coming in.
NEUT22|There's rounds and rounds of investment.
NEUT23|So again by the time it goes public I I do think there's some concern that these things have now been inflated.
NEUT24|They're rich so I'm not saying these are absolutely real companies.
NEUT25|Richard, the there often rich.
NEUT26|What's happened since 2000.
NEUT27|Sarbanes Oxley and Dodd Frank which is made it harder for companies to come public by agree well to the dominates point.
NEUT28|All the made up valuation metrics, eyeballs, clicks today box.
NEUT29|The CEO.
BEAR30|I think this guy is making it a terrible mistake.
BEAR31|He said he's at war with the analyst because they don't know how to analyze this company.
NEUT32|The last person I heard say that was a couple years ago was Groupon.
NEUT33|They made up their own valuation metrics and they think Wall Street Wall Street's not buying it.
NEUT34|Investors are buying him that he was on his network earlier as an interview and I wasn't buying it either.
NEUT35|I mean.
NEUT36|You either tied me up or crushed me 'cause I'm going with Groupon.
NEUT37|1011 the biggest Internet IPO since Google in in 2004.
NEUT38|It's a different Business Today they got blasted for the deals.
NEUT39|They now sell more than half the revenues come from goods.
NEUT40|They sell goods by the way, about half the revenues from Amazon comes from goods.
NEUT41|So people don't care where they're buying it from.
NEUT42|If they get it cheap online, they are a good man.
NEUT43|They sell goods, guess what group I'm going to back.
BULL44|Their earnings have been beating the street recently.
NEUT45|I was feeling was asking what are your feelings on Coke?
BULL46|Long term, it's a tough one because I know I gotta feeling it will be up long term.
NEUT47|This is a Warren Buffett favor but.
NEUT48|It's got a very narrow trading range.
NEUT49|Their their one dimensional.
NEUT50|They are taking market share, but they're taking market share in a market that's drinking.
NEUT51|I like Pepsi better.
NEUT52|I love monster.
NEUT53|If you want to be a little bit more risky.
NEUT54|Coca-Cola guys.
NEUT55|I mean the book despite the strong dollar than the headwind.
BULL56|Despite the move away from unhealthy drinks, they still raise their dividend.
NEUT57|As you said, it's a blue chip is going to be around that.
NEUT58|I say it's good for portfolio.
NEUT59|Long term.
NEUT60|"I'd buy here."""
