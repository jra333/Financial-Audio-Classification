NEUT1|You might have read some of the articles that I've written as a Forbes brand voice contributor.
NEUT2|Just today I received one of the articles from one of the partner companies I work with.
NEUT3|This signed copy, talked about stock market volatility time to diversify.
NEUT4|Also, perhaps you saw this article online on the Internet, but think about the stock market right now.
NEUT5|Where is it going next?
NEUT6|I shot a video when I was at an investment conference in Las Vegas in January.
BULL7|The stock market was at an all time high and a lot of people thought, or at least some thought it was going to continue to increase.
BEAR8|And then of course February, March and April we saw a lot of volatility.
NEUT9|Now where is it headed next?
NEUT10|Well, that's exactly what I wrote about in this article.
NEUT11|Places that some people have chosen to diversify.
NEUT12|So if you like a copy of this article, feel free to reach out to my office.
