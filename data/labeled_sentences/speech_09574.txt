BEAR0|"""To bring in Charlie Beckham, his partner at Haynes and Boone in Houston, Charlie, you're missing an incredible job highlighting all of the bankruptcies with nearly 200 since the beginning of 2015."
BEAR1|Are we almost through this bankruptcy cycle in the distress to oil and gas Patch?
NEUT2|We are not.
NEUT3|OK, so how much further do we have to go?
NEUT4|It in 2015 when all this started.
NEUT5|We those in the bankruptcy industry thought that this could take a couple of years and going into 2018 I thought we were in the late innings of the downturn in the bankruptcies for in the EMP industry.
NEUT6|Now with turning the corner in 2019, I think we are actually in the second game of a doubleheader.
NEUT7|In the early innings.
BEAR8|Wait, this is a huge.
NEUT9|This is huge prediction.
NEUT10|Charlie, in other words, so far we've seen nearly $70 billion of debt involved in bankruptcies since the beginning of 2015.
NEUT11|What do you think that the total volume could be?
NEUT12|By the time this is through?
NEUT13|You know the number is actually in our statistics.
NEUT14|Little over 108 billion and that was through September of this year.
BEAR15|I would say that in 2019 we've seen another 15 billion go into bankruptcy debt at risk.
BULL16|I think that those numbers will increase through the end of the year.
NEUT17|We know that there are.
BEAR18|A handful of other large companies that are on the edge so you could see I don't know that you're going to see the numbers double because I'm not sure there's enough debt out there at risk.
BEAR19|In EMP, companies left, but you could easily see another 25 to $50 billion at risk over the next two years.
NEUT20|So Charlie, what do you think recoveries will be like?
NEUT21|Depends when you look at a bankruptcy for an E&P company, think of it as a three layer cake.
NEUT22|The top layer is generally senior secured lenders who have not seen much distress or impairment in the bankruptcies through 2018.
NEUT23|Then you have junior debt and equity at the bottom.
BEAR24|For the most part in almost all of the bankruptcies we've seen since 2015, equity has been wiped out.
NEUT25|The middle layer of debt, which is June Lee Junior Bond debt and such as that.
NEUT26|Has converted debt to equity.
NEUT27|Yeah, and I would say probably 2/3 of that has has been a debt for equity conversion.
BULL28|Waiting to hold on till 2019 when everyone thought commodity prices would increase as it happened and in 2019 we are seeing significant differences.
BEAR29|"An impairment in that first lien debt, which I think is frightening to many of the commercial banks."""
