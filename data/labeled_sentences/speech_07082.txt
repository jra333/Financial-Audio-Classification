BEAR0|"""Ken Mahoney kicked it off with you."
NEUT1|What's your take in terms of allocating capital to this market?
NEUT2|Given what's gone on with tech?
BEAR3|I mean you've got this huge run up over the last couple of years and then a real roll over in tech over the last couple of weeks or so.
NEUT4|Do you still want to be a seller of big tech?
NEUT5|So we're equal weight.
NEUT6|You know we're in that stay at home economy for quite some time in that kind of long technology trade over waiting.
NEUT7|But if you notice actually now in the last couple weeks, Maria, but you have to go back in November when Pfizer commanded the vaccination and week later Moderna came out and he started seeing money shifting to other industries, which is positive.
NEUT8|I mean how long we gotta hide out and stay at home economy and technology so it is nice to see it's broadening out one big overhang.
NEUT9|We're seeing though this past week is talking this $3 trillion unpaid for stimulus plan or infrastructure planning on quality.
NEUT10|And how you pay for taxes?
BULL11|I'm actually getting calls from clients and Cpas already now and here we are now in the in the March talking bout taking profits on technology shares they've done so well the last couple of years because they worry about higher capital gains.
NEUT12|So I think you know if we do get more talk about higher capital gains tax, I think you know we go from equal weight technology to underweight technology.
BULL13|So you do think that the idea of taxes going higher will dampen what has been a very strong stock market?
NEUT14|I agree with you, that's what I've been saying.
NEUT15|If you're going to take the capital gains tax from 20% to close to 40%, obviously you're going to see people want to get out of their portfolio in 21 as opposed to 22.
NEUT16|Yeah, seems like game over like we were counting on the moderate Democrats to kind of, you know, have some common sense here, but again, that's there's no common sense it seems.
NEUT17|I mean look, they're running and racing as fast they can before the midterm elections, because they may get whooped in midterm elections like Obama did.
NEUT18|So they learn that playbook from Obama, which is get these things done now so they're running really fast and heavy.
NEUT19|I mean, I call us a two act play.
NEUT20|By the way.
NEUT21|Maria, which is the first act stimulus?
NEUT22|Good for the market, the little plot twist here now is higher taxes in a second act.
NEUT23|But quite frankly I thought the intermission will last maybe 3-4 five months.
NEUT24|I didn't think it would be like.
NEUT25|Measure the three days we go from a 1.9 infrastructure to a $3 trillion.
BEAR26|I'm sorry.
BULL27|1.9 stimulus to $3 trillion infrastructure bill.
NEUT28|I thought it was going to take months to do.
NEUT29|I thought we talked about this or fallen here.
NEUT30|"We are running, racing or towards this problem."""
