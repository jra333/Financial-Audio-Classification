NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to the Goldco News brief."
NEUT1|I'm your host, Kevin Douglas.
BULL2|Throughout the past year we have watched the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 break their all time records several times.
BULL3|Not to mention the NASDAQ has shown some pretty impressive growth as well.
BEAR4|However, there is a bit of a dark cloud looming over the US stock market.
NEUT5|The simple fact is that stock values are growing far faster than their underlying assets.
BULL6|When we look at the most recent corporate earnings reports, it's easy to see that stock prices are growing at a much faster rate than asset earnings.
NEUT7|As a matter of fact, so many investors follow valuations in comparison to earnings that there's a metric called the Shiller price earnings ratio or the Shiller PE ratio that was designed to track these very numbers in cases where the stock market is growing at a sustainable rate.
NEUT8|The Shiller PE ratio is usually around 16.
NEUT9|However, in today's stock market, we're seeing something completely different today.
BEAR10|The Shiller PE ratio is over 25, meaning that investors are grossly overpaying for stocks.
NEUT11|However, the market does have a way of working over valuations out as a matter of fact, it's happened time and time again throughout history.
BEAR12|It's called a market correction where market values will fall by at least 10%.
NEUT13|There is a bit of a silver lining in all of this.
NEUT14|When a market correction does happen, you do not have to take losses.
BEAR15|Historically, as stock prices fall, the value of gold goes up.
BULL16|So by taking advantage of the ability to buy gold Now at low rates, you can protect yourself from losing money during the looming market correction.
BULL17|Thank you for tuning in today.
