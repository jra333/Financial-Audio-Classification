NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol IZEA."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Quite the crazy day on this one.
NEUT4|Not much a Kurd earlier on in the day.
NEUT5|And then all of a sudden the late day afternoon came around an, you know, volume exploded.
NEUT6|Pulled back a little bit, but more of the story.
NEUT7|There's gonna be a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward, and rightfully so.
NEUT8|A pretty unique day, so let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT9|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal owners.
NEUT10|Claim one make this chart look the best going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT11|Could say up there above $0.94.
NEUT12|I don't get me wrong.
NEUT13|If the price falls below 94.
NEUT14|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but you have the price.
BULL15|Could manage step above that level.
BULL16|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT17|Taking a step back and looking at things from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT18|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT19|The 50.
NEUT20|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT21|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is helpful because when it comes to engaging in the health of the move.
NEUT22|That right there are being defined as the move.
NEUT23|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT24|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control of it.
NEUT25|Visualize that that is what is being represented again.
NEUT26|Yeah, stand above 94 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned.
NEUT27|First, the level to watch is going to be right there at the dollar mark, and then after a dollar at next key level after that right up there around.
NEUT28|Let's see what is that?
NEUT29|The dollar eight mark so dollar dollar eight next couple of roadblocks to watch moving forward.
NEUT30|But All in all, any angle you look at it.
NEUT31|Very interesting volume situation.
BEAR32|Price spike today.
NEUT33|So not just a question of can the price begin to build upon this momentum?
NEUT34|Moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT35|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT36|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT37|But it will be me.
NEUT38|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL39|To being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR42|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT45|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT46|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
