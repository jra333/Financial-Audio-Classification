BEAR0|"""One of the worst of the week stock patterns was only down 2% on the week."
NEUT1|I wanted to bring it to you because I like to bring something that I think has got opportunity that didn't happen yet.
NEUT2|I think Netflix is making a big top and when you look at this pattern I'm going to do some bigger cycle analysis for you to see.
NEUT3|You can see.
NEUT4|So this has got a little more involved.
NEUT5|Cycle analysis on it.
NEUT6|I have to move this out to a 10 year chart to get the proper cycle alignments that you could see right there.
NEUT7|So there are three large cycles that you can see right there.
NEUT8|Each of them made up of three parts.
NEUT9|OK, so you can see there's this big cycle right here and it's made up of the three smaller cycles that you can see right here.
NEUT10|Here is this big one right over here made up of three smaller cycles.
NEUT11|What do we have right now?
BEAR12|We have this dotted line shows you the big pattern and that shows a decline out here into June.
BULL13|June OK, or possibly a little bit longer.
BULL14|That says that there's a potential that there's a big top forming in here.
NEUT15|Let's get this lined up for you to see and you could see there are one cycle right in here.
NEUT16|Pretty two cycles right?
NEUT17|In here.
NEUT18|Bullish, right?
BEAR19|Nice the rally an already threatening the low.
NEUT20|As you can see right here that says the odds are very high that what you're doing is making a top in here.
NEUT21|This could be a head and shoulders that forms.
NEUT22|Or it could just be coming down and breaking this low.
BEAR23|This pattern in here with this big pushing down of nested cycles over this.
NEUT24|Next we'll call it about six weeks says that there is a lot of risk in here in Netflix.
BEAR25|We think there's going to be a big break to the downside in Netflix here is this pattern in here and there is a very negative pattern shaping up in here so you could see again, this is the daily chart.
NEUT26|There's your big cycle right here and here.
NEUT27|And here very clear, right?
NEUT28|You can see all three of them.
NEUT29|Here is your half cycles and you can see this one right here.
NEUT30|This one right here, this one right here.
NEUT31|And this little rally.
BEAR32|And after that's over with Wham, we think that there's a big decline coming out into May.
NEUT33|June in Netflix wanted to show you that just so that we could share something that we thought was going to be very actionable, and that is something that I think is important to look at so.
NEUT34|"That is Netflix."""
