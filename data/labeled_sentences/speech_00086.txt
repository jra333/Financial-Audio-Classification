NEUT0|"""What's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back on the video this is a boy.
BULL2|Will hope you guys are having a good day.
NEUT3|Wish you guys give it like subscribe.
NEUT4|Comment below for that.
NEUT5|YouTube algorithms help you play out and today will be talking about Nano Dimension's ticker, symbol, NVM and I'll be giving you guys the key trading range that I want price to go into for me to continue being bullish.
NEUT6|'cause right now it is overbought right now.
NEUT7|And it is being extended.
BEAR8|And usually when stocks have this run up like this for consecutive days.
NEUT9|Once it gets like to the 5th, 4th or 5th day and it still be growing up, I usually wait for the stock to come back down.
NEUT10|So the first one 2-3 days.
NEUT11|Is a good day to get in, but for the 4th or 5th day, yeah, we usually wait, could use their their pullbacks after those days and you can see it kinda pull back on the 4th day but then it kept going up so I am waiting for a call back.
NEUT12|This is a support level.
NEUT13|Around $8.00 we figure.
BULL14|But I'm gonna give you guys a little a little better.
NEUT15|Some support level that I would see that I would typically give.
NEUT16|The people in the picture on that I will be creating soon, but I'll go ahead and give you guys this now so you can see price come around 9950 level.
NEUT17|And.
NEUT18|Around 9:10 so these this is the trading range that I'm looking for a price to come into.
BULL19|I do think it will help pull back 'cause it's been running good lately.
NEUT20|So this is where I want to see price come into.
NEUT21|Usually I would just say this price.
NEUT22|And I would have this price for my patrion people, but but since I haven't started it yet, I'll give you guys this price right now.
NEUT23|This is priced that I wanted to come down into trade in here and then come back out of that would be very bullish.
NEUT24|But if it comes in this range and start shutting down.
NEUT25|Then I will look to the support level price and then if it breaks that level then I will be another level.
NEUT26|But I don't think it would do that yet.
NEUT27|'cause tomorrow is 1/2 day and Friday is close.
NEUT28|So this would really be for next week.
NEUT29|Well, you guys can mark this on your charts.
NEUT30|I'm pretty sure price will come back down here.
NEUT31|Trade in this range and the key is what price does in this range will give us what we can do next on this stock weather.
NEUT32|Be bearish, bullish or just traded in a range and we just be patient and wait.
NEUT33|OK so the level is 9:50 and 9:10.
NEUT34|I will be waiting for price to come back in here, but if it still goes higher.
NEUT35|Then I'll make another video on some new levels we can look forward to tomorrow, but as I see price right now, this is the trading range I'm looking for it to stay bullish.
NEUT36|OK, so it will be guys like this video.
NEUT37|Letters of recommendation by yourself.
NEUT38|Anything this is for educational purposes only.
NEUT39|Do not trade anything you see or hear in this video.
NEUT40|"And I'll catch you guys in the next month."""
