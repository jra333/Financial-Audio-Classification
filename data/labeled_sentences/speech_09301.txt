NEUT0|"""Hey guys, welcome traders talk about OMC L today at 8645."
NEUT1|So right around here you see, here is a break.
BULL2|Here's the basically the buy point, so there was a lot of resistance all throughout here and the stock basically broke out on decent volume.
BULL3|Went up to 92.5 an in that level.
BEAR4|It was actually overbought so the stock has come down.
BULL5|Since then I picked it up here, I just did my stop loss about 8% below, but I expect this.
NEUT6|To basically bounce off here and go up a little bit higher or trade around here for a little bit and then go higher.
NEUT7|So if it does crash for this by point and goes down, I'm going to take the loss and sell, but hopefully goes up.
