NEUT0|"""Recently a Bloomberg and Reuters report came out saying that looping Motors is in talks to go public with microcline fact ticker symbol C Civ."
NEUT1|My question is regardless if this practical goes through is lucid Motors Motors worth it?
NEUT2|But yes, yes, it's one of the good ones and I've spent a lot of time on this group.
NEUT3|10 years, but I saw the Churchill capital.
NEUT4|I sit on darn it all.
NEUT5|I wish I'd got that before because they're very, very smart people.
BULL6|Yeah, I think you're OK to.
BULL7|I think it's a good situation.
NEUT8|I know it's speculative, but I think it's good.
NEUT9|Listen, there's Churchill.
NEUT10|I want to get to that in a minute, but you know, that's where we stand right now where people are just willing to pay up.
NEUT11|Let me just get in now.
NEUT12|In this case, those guys are.
BULL13|Fairly well thought of, and so there is an expectation that they're going to do a good deal.
NEUT14|Speaking of deals, you saw Churchill.
NEUT15|We just brought that up.
NEUT16|That was the second largest back of all time in terms of what they raise.
NEUT17|Second, only to akmens.
NEUT18|Look at the move that that is made.
NEUT19|This is on that Bloomberg story from last week.
NEUT20|That said they were reportedly in talks with Lucid.
NEUT21|Remember, lucid is that EV maker out of Saudi Arabia, really, or at least backed by the Saudis making incredibly expensive cars.
NEUT22|I went through them here.
NEUT23|Of course I can't find it, but you know up to 150,000 if not more in terms of their cost.
NEUT24|They do charge more quickly.
NEUT25|Very much unclear though at this point, whether they're going to reach a deal that's kind of what I wanted to share here.
NEUT26|It's out of stock in the market that Michael Klein.
NEUT27|Andrew Liveris involved the Saudis.
NEUT28|He advised both of them and his other role is a longtime banker.
NEUT29|So yes, no doubt the relationships there.
NEUT30|But getting to a deal here where it would be a transaction through which they would use Churchill for to go public at lucid.
NEUT31|What I'm hearing is don't necessarily jump to conclusions at this point.
NEUT32|Based on that Bloomberg story from last week.
NEUT33|I'm going to continue to follow up and we'll see where that stands.
NEUT34|Yeah, it's not no way is it a done deal.
NEUT35|Stocks up usually huge, that's why I mention it.
BEAR36|Stock is up enormously.
NEUT37|Jim and I said to buy on Lightning round last night, 'cause I thought that story was spot on and loose.
NEUT38|Well, you know again, just because you're talking doesn't mean that you're going to get a deal done.
NEUT39|By the way they do have three cars coming to market, the air Grand Touring this summer, 131 thousand, the Air Touring late 2021.
NEUT40|87,000 and the air pure.
NEUT41|"At 69,000 early 2022."""
