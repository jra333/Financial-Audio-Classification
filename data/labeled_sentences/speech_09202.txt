BEAR0|"""Bitcoin is seeing a lot more pushback on its carbon footprint, and that's causing a dilemma for some fund managers."
BULL1|On the one hand, crypto has seen a lot of price upside, but they also need to weigh demand for some more environmentally friendly investments to create new Bitcoin.
NEUT2|It takes an energy intensive process called mining, so you can't do this on a laptop.
NEUT3|It's done through high powered computers.
NEUT4|An estimated 65% of global mining is coming from China.
NEUT5|And about a third comes from the cold burning region of Xinjiang.
NEUT6|That's an area in northern China.
BULL7|Analysts tell me that the energy it takes to mine Bitcoin has gone up with demand this year.
BULL8|And according to estimates from Digicon, amist, Bitcoin CO2 footprint is now bigger than entire countries.
NEUT9|That includes Chile, Austria and Bangladesh.
BEAR10|Bill Gates is among those warning about the impact Bank of America warned about it this week.
BEAR11|In a note to clients, an one analyst from BCA predicts that the energy issue could cause Bitcoin to quote lose most of its value overtime.
BULL12|Institutional investors have been cited as a key driver of Bitcoins 100% rally this year.
BEAR13|Any drop off in that demand could weigh on prices.
NEUT14|The crypto industry, though, argues that a lot of this Bitcoin mining uses excess energy.
NEUT15|Jack Dorsey is among those who have predicted that Bitcoin will eventually be powered completely by clean energy Tyler.
NEUT16|So Kate, let me ask you the question that hangs in the air about this.
NEUT17|What about investing in companies that buy Bitcoin and hold them on their balance sheet like Dorsey Square, MicroStrategy, Tesla, could Bitcoin investments then make it such that those funds that have ESG sort of goals can't go there?
BEAR18|That's right, and certainly muddies the water analyst that I've been talking to this week.
NEUT19|Say companies that are otherwise pureplay ESG investments.
NEUT20|If you think of Tesla clean energy, their square scores very high on diversity and ESG, their Bitcoin exposure might make fund managers think twice, but there's also no legal distinction, so it is very subjective.
NEUT21|It's up to the fund managers, but it certainly complicates it in that Bank of America, no doubt this week.
NEUT22|They also mentioned that it's not just environmental, they talk about some of the negatives that regulators have also worried about including money laundering.
NEUT23|And other illicit activity.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
