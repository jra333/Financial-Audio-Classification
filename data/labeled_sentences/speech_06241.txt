NEUT0|"""What is an index presented by wallstreetsurvivor.com?"
NEUT1|An index is a quick and easy way to get an idea about how a general market is performing.
NEUT2|Here's Jessica.
NEUT3|Jessica is in high school and is running for class president.
NEUT4|Before the election, Jessica wants to see how she stands to find out what her chances are of winning.
BEAR5|The problem is her class is 500 people and asking everyone will be too much work.
NEUT6|So what's the alternative?
NEUT7|Instead, Jessica decides to pull a sample of students to at least get an idea of the percentage of students that would vote for her.
NEUT8|It's not a perfect solution, but it's much easier.
NEUT9|Similarly, an index is a sample of stocks that provide a glimpse at the broader market.
NEUT10|When you hear someone say the market is up 100 points, the market they're referring to is an index.
NEUT11|There are three major US indices, the Dow Jones Industrial average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite Index.
NEUT12|The Dow is the oldest and most famous index.
NEUT13|It takes a weighted average of the 30 largest stocks on the New York Stock Exchange.
NEUT14|These 30.
NEUT15|Stocks are so heavily traded that they represent the majority of the Market Volume.
NEUT16|Therefore, these 30 stocks are generally a good indicator of the entire market.
NEUT17|The S&P index takes a weighted average of the 500 most widely held stocks on the market.
NEUT18|These 500 stocks account for approximately 70% of the entire market.
NEUT19|Most professionals use the SNP's performance as their benchmark.
NEUT20|Lastly, the NASDAQ looks at over 3000 stocks.
NEUT21|The NASDAQ used to be an index exclusively for tech stocks, but has grown to include a few stocks from different industries as well.
