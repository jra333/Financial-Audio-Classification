NEUT0|"""Yeah, my name is Jimmy."
BEAR1|Sorry Rademacher from Omaha.
NEUT2|Is there any point at which your stock would rise to the point where you might split the stock?
NEUT3|Surprise, surprise.
NEUT4|I think I'll let Charlie answer that this year.
NEUT5|He's so popular with the shareholders that I can afford to take the tough questions.
NEUT6|I think the answer is no.
NEUT7|I think the idea of carving ownership, sannon enterprise and a little tiny $20 pieces is almost insane.
NEUT8|It's quite inefficient to serve as a $20 account and.
NEUT9|And.
NEUT10|I don't see why there shouldn't be a minimum.
NEUT11|As a condition of joining some enterprise, certainly we'd all feel that way.
NEUT12|In a private enterprise.
NEUT13|Yeah, we would not carve it up in $20 units.
NEUT14|We find it very.
NEUT15|It's interesting because.
NEUT16|Every every company finds a way to fill up its its common shareholder list.
NEUT17|And you can.
NEUT18|You can start with the Asian work through disease and you know every company in New York Stock Exchange one way or another has attracted some constituency of shareholders.
NEUT19|Anne, frankly, we can't imagine imagine a better constituency than is in this room.
NEUT20|I mean, we we have.
BULL21|We don't think we can improve on this group and we followed certain policies that we think.
NEUT22|Attracted certain certain types of shareholders an actually pushed away others and and that is part of part of our eugenics program here at Berkshire.
NEUT23|Yeah, just.
NEUT24|Look around this room and as you mingle with one another.
NEUT25|This is a very outstanding group of people.
NEUT26|And.
NEUT27|Why would anybody want a different kind of a group?
NEUT28|Yeah, if we 'cause if we if we follow some policies that cause a whole bunch of people.
NEUT29|To buy Berkshire for the wrong reason, the only way they buy it is to replace somebody in this room or in this larger metaphorical room with shareholders that we have.
NEUT30|So someone in there, someone at one of the seats gets up and somebody else walks in.
NEUT31|Question is, do we have a better audience?
NEUT32|I don't think so.
NEUT33|So I think that.
NEUT34|Like CC said it very well.
NEUT35|"Zone ***"""
