BULL0|"""Palantir stock ticker symbol PLT are welcome, so we're going to take a look today at Palantir Stock ticker."
BULL1|Symbol to PLT went up on Friday, 1.42% currently standing at 2432.
BEAR2|You can see here that we have dropped a little bit from the local high that we had here is 2747.
NEUT3|Currently sitting at the 2432 area you can see right between these two levels that means zoom in the 2371 and the 2465.
NEUT4|So it's sitting right in the middle of this two.
NEUT5|Areas you can see we have here this blue line.
BEAR6|This line here is the Ma so the the Ma here is the above the current price meaning that the stock is lower than the average so that's a little bit concerning for me.
BEAR7|We could see here a little bit of a downtrend.
NEUT8|I'm going to be looking to the stock to get even to the 20 area before I would consider buying into this stock.
NEUT9|You can see here the stochastic all the red has crossed under the purple meaning that there was a change of direction here and we can see it.
BEAR10|That were going in a downtrend.
NEUT11|You can see that the stock had maybe a start of a shoulder here, maybe a head and shoulder.
NEUT12|It's maybe a pregnant lady.
BEAR13|It's really hard for me always to see these.
NEUT14|You know, the analogies to these things.
NEUT15|The head and shoulders, the pregnant ladies?
NEUT16|The laughing guy.
NEUT17|I don't know.
NEUT18|I like to use the fibbonaci.
BEAR19|I like to lose use resistance and support levels.
NEUT20|We can see here that we had a high of 45 so that would be on the up and up and up.
NEUT21|We would look at the 45 as a resistance.
NEUT22|And the 30 would also be a resistance area, because this was the high that we had here after we went up.
NEUT23|And then we started pulling back.
NEUT24|So that would be the next resistance on the way up if we would ever get there.
NEUT25|So this would be the 27 would be at a resistance and then the 30 would be resistance.
BULL26|After that the Magdi is actually looking good on that front because the blue is over the yellow and that's because we had an uptrend here that started bringing the average of the prices to this area, the 27.
BEAR27|After there was a decline and now you can see after we had two green juicy candles, we have a four green candles still, but we're getting really close to that area where the blue will cross the yellow and then we'll be in a downtrend for sure.
NEUT28|If that happens, the RSI is right in the middle 43 area, so it's not too over, but it's not too oversold.
NEUT29|It's going to be interesting to see if there's any new catalyst any new deals for this stack?
BEAR30|The hype around is a little bit died down after we had this amazing run.
BEAR31|From 9 all the way to 45, it's pulled back a little bit.
BULL32|A little bit of consolidation here in the 2425 area, so if we're able to break again this 30 area, even then, we could see a really nice uptrend all the way up to the 45.
NEUT33|So I'm going to be watching.
NEUT34|It's on that point.
