BEAR2|Facebook stock is down after hours.
NEUT3|These after reporting their quarterly report for Q3 2018.
BEAR4|It's been down over 5% a few minutes back, but then it's coming back.
BEAR5|However, it's been down for close to.
BEAR6|Uh, over last year it's been down by for year to date it's down 17% and it was trading at $146 today.
NEUT7|Let's take a look at the earnings.
NEUT8|Earnings per share estimate is 1.47 dollars, whereas the actual 1.76 dollars revenues expected was $13.78 billion, whereas the actuals were $13.73 billion.
BEAR9|Estimated daily active users is 1.49 billion versus estimated 1.5 billion and monthly active users 2.27 billion versus estimated 2.29 billion and average revenue per user is 6.09 dollars versus 6.09 dollars.
NEUT10|So.
NEUT11|Looking at the stock, I probably think this was expected.
BEAR12|Most of us know about it because Google and Amazon also had revenues miss, but they beat the earnings per share estimate.
BEAR13|The same thing happened here too for Facebook, so it's no surprise because of the correlations because of the market has been down and being down for some time and Facebook has been down for a long time.
NEUT14|However, because of the correlations with these talks, we clearly know that in their businesses.
BEAR15|That it would be down because the revenues miss happened with Amazon as well as Alphabet.
BULL16|It happened with Facebook, but all the three companies have beaten the earnings per share.
NEUT17|Will have to wait and see how this stock fares tomorrow.
BULL18|It's been done over 5% earlier, but then it's been recovering and then going around during the after hours.
NEUT19|We'll have to wait and see what happens.
