BULL0|"""Had to pick one FedEx or UPS and I know you got byes on both."
NEUT1|Which one would it be?
BULL2|Thanks Brian, happy Holidays to you and Sarah there at the studio.
BULL3|You know, I'd say you know, certainly a great run through the Holidays and and with the vaccine.
BULL4|On top of that, it's even more impressive what they're able to accomplish.
NEUT5|You know, we did give a slight edge at the beginning with UPS moving the Pfizer vaccine because they had the right to move the kits, which is the syringe.
NEUT6|The swabs that needles along with the vaccine and then FedEx and UPS split half the country for Pfizer.
NEUT7|Now with with.
NEUT8|Project Warpspeed you have now.
NEUT9|The company split McKesson, handing both UPS and FedEx.
NEUT10|Although Mckesson's locali distributing closer to FedEx is headquarters, so you're seeing them get a little bit of lead on that distribution and the kids are moving with the vaccine from the maternal part of it.
BEAR11|In Project warp speed, but a slight edge during the FedEx move.
BEAR12|I'm sorry UPS on the on the Pfizer distribution.
NEUT13|Yeah, looking at your price targets I believe I'm trying to do the math.
NEUT14|Can correct me if I'm wrong.
NEUT15|It looks like you have nearly 30% upside still left in FedEx only about 6 or 8% in UPS.
NEUT16|So I mean obviously, but just by that math you're going to FedEx.
BULL17|I know we do favor right now.
BEAR18|Little bit more Tord FedEx just given the upside, they did have a little bit of a disappointing 23% more excited FedEx and UPS UPS.
BULL19|Again, UPS is set up a little bit better into their quarter.
BEAR20|Just 'cause we had a little bit of a pullback at at.
BULL21|FedEx, with their recent results with their ground margins.
NEUT22|We do like FedEx a little bit more right now your question, I thought was more on the vaccine distribution, which is a very small portion of the total distribution is just a minor portion of the package.
NEUT23|Is there moving every day?
NEUT24|But our favorite is and like I guess it is a little bit more based on RPO Tord FedEx relative to UPS.
NEUT25|But we do as you mentioned, have eyes on both.
NEUT26|Yeah, I mean, outside of vaccines, what you know there's a lot of debate about how much we go back to the stores, how much does online shopping stay at these levels?
NEUT27|It almost seems unsustainable in some ways, which are crystal ball, say for the next 12 months.
NEUT28|Can, as far as how much these companies still see these kinds of volumes?
BULL29|Well, we're seeing phenomenal volumes, right?
BEAR30|You were running at peak levels before peak season just because of the covert environment.
NEUT31|And so FedEx was running at 18 million a day.
BULL32|They'll get up to probably 24 million packages during peak.
NEUT33|So you get that up to 35% more on UPS.
NEUT34|They run about 24 million packages day.
NEUT35|You could see that get over 30 million packages day.
NEUT36|So both these networks are completely running at full steam.
NEUT37|Thank you, go back to look at 2013 when Amazon kind of surprised with the speed what you've seen during this peak season is a very good control by UPS and FedEx to say to retailers.
BULL38|Hey, you've promised us X amount of volumes we can only take some of that so they pushed back on some of them and that's allowed them to have a very smooth peak season.
BULL39|So far again, there's way more demand given kovid and everything else.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
