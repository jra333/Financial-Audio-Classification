NEUT0|"""Hello YouTube, welcome back to the channel today and so we're gonna be talking about AMC stock."
BEAR1|AMC Entertainment recently has seen quite a bit of a downfall today around 14.5% Downfall.
NEUT2|OK so only around 5% of you guys actually watch my videos are actually subscribed to my channel.
NEUT3|Also if you have it make sure you hit the notification Bell as well.
BULL4|I hope so my channel lot also AMC Entertainment is going to see huge movement.
NEUT5|Definitely here soon as we are starting to see resistance not actually be here at 1454.
BEAR6|As I mentioned in my previous video on AMC and I mentioned that we was having trouble trying to break the resistance at 1454.
BULL7|And I believe now that we're going to go down back to the support of 1091.
BULL8|As I mentioned in my previous video, but there's potential we could bounce off that going back up to the 12 to $13.00, as I do think that AMC is going to be one that you have to kind of watch out for on the daily.
NEUT9|And remember, I'm not a financial advisor, is just for entertainment purposes only.
BEAR10|So make sure you do your own due diligence on any of these stocks for the little time that we have seen AMC and the stock market been open today we have seen it go to a low of $11.76 with a high of $13.19 and open.
BULL11|On the 52 week range, we've seen this thought goes high as $20.36 under last gamma squeeze.
NEUT12|Also, AMC Entertainment is going to be one that they are trying to actually short squeeze.
NEUT13|They're trying to get it to go past that $20 mark as I do think it is going to be a lot like GameStop and see huge movements like GameStop.
NEUT14|Did.
NEUT15|The volume on AMC right now is 47.995 million, which is pretty big for how long the stock market has been open.
NEUT16|The average volume on a 10 day.
NEUT17|Is sitting around 140.919 million and the market cap for AMC stock today is 5.366 billion.
NEUT18|So what do you think is going to happen next to AMC?
NEUT19|AMC Entertainment recently come out and said that they would be opening up up a lot of their entertainment theaters in certain states.
BULL20|As I do think that is going to be something good.
BULL21|Long term frames, the entertainment I do think AMC Entertainment still has a long way to go with revenue as they do need to kind of get the revenue back up and normal and stabilize it back an whenever the pandemic is completely gone, everything is open back up.
NEUT22|We don't have to wear these masks or stay 6 feet apart.
BULL23|Again, I do think AMC Entertainment theaters will see a boom in sales.
NEUT24|As I do think where a lot of people has been locked up in their house, not really able to go out to theaters and they are limited to what they can do.
NEUT25|I think once everything goes back to normal, a lot of people will be going back to theaters, amusement parks, stuff like that is going to be one of the biggest boomers at the time.
BULL26|I do think AMC Entertainment is going to be a good long term hold as you're going to hold this stock for a long long term.
NEUT27|If you do take a look about five years ago on AMC stock you can see it kind of helped.
NEUT28|It has moved in a previous five years.
BULL29|I do think AMC Entertainment is going to go back up to around $20 in the long term, but in the short term we can see a lot of volatility coming into this stock coming from around.
NEUT30|Probably the 10 to the $15.00 range will probably sit around there like we have for the last week.
BULL31|I do think once we do break either the sport of those instances when we're going to see the next biggest moves in AMC Entertainment, as I do think AMC stock is going to see huge movement within the next 4 weeks as we are starting to open up more theaters that are going to start seeing more and more openings for their theaters, which could be something good for US investors investing into AMC stock.
