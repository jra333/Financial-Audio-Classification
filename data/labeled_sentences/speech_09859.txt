BULL0|"""We are really, truly looking at a global sell off her socks."
NEUT1|Take a look at the S&P 500 and NASDAQ here in the US.
BEAR2|We are down more than 2% for both of those indexes at the lows and NASDAQ down more than 3% at that point and pays for its worst day since early December.
BEAR3|Right now in peace for the worst day since January 3rd.
NEUT4|So investors really continuing last week sell off the worst of the year into this week.
NEUT5|But it's not just in the US as Bonnie and I were just mentioning it is global.
BEAR6|Take a look at the stock 600 down 1% and the emerging markets down 1.6% really being dragged on by China.
BEAR7|China officially in a correction down more than 10% in the S&P 500 on this bearish action over the last six sessions or so, is doing something interesting when we go into the Bloomberg.
NEUT8|Let's take a look at a chart that we've looked at often because this chart is really telling the story, and that story is a range of battle between the Bulls and the Bears over the last 18 months or so.
BEAR9|Neither side winning right now, the sellers are clearly pushing the S&P 500 back down into that range firmly below the 50 day moving average, perhaps headed toward the 200 day moving average, which is not shown, maybe even going back down below that 2800.
BEAR10|The top of another part of the range and take a look at the RSI absolutely plummeting toward oversold conditions.
NEUT11|It'll be interesting to see whether or not the buyers pick it up there.
NEUT12|As for what's really dragging here in the US, let's take a look at the top point laggards and the top point drags, I should say.
NEUT13|And the biggest percentage lagers, Apple, and Amazon.
NEUT14|Those are the big point.
BEAR15|Lagers Apple right now down 5% last week having its worst week of the year down.
NEUT16|I believe about 8% and of course on trade tensions, 20% of the revenue comes from China.
NEUT17|Much of their production is in China in the supply chain.
BEAR18|So really getting hit their Amazon, lower my land down 7.9%, the generic drug company really plummeting on allegations around generic drugs around pricing in this stock.
BEAR19|Really getting hit in Freeport MC Rand Bonnie was talking about the Copper group, Freeport MC MA ran one of the worst performers for the S&P 500, down 6.3%.
NEUT20|The copper miner.
BEAR21|Let's take a look at copper since the middle of April because while the S&P 500 was putting on all time highs, take a look at copper absolutely falling over the last 20 trading sessions or so, down 7.7%.
NEUT22|Doctor Copper it's thought to be telling the global economy and of course China is the biggest consumer of natural resources, so this is a tell on China and we can see this more clearly if we hop back into the Bloomberg and take a look at this chart that we have also looked at before guy 'cause we've been talking about how China has been leading this downtrend.
NEUT23|What we're looking at here in purple is copper, which really never took off on the year we have China here in Orange we have oil in yellow, the socks and white and the S&P 500.
NEUT24|These areas of the risk continuum guide.
BEAR25|They all start to turn down in mid April as the S&P 500 is chugging along.
BULL26|"Now there are some key 500 is catching up to that downdraft, and in fact, as we were talking about earlier a global risk off sell off."""
