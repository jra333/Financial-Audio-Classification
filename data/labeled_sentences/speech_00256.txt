NEUT0|"""8 for the banks in about 12 for the stock market, and I was hooked."
NEUT1|Hi everybody, this is Sam with Python basics and today we're going to look at installing.
NEUT2|Yahoo finance.
NEUT3|So let's just jump at it.
NEUT4|So if you're new here, thanks for joining us.

NEUT6|Subscribe Button and the notification Bell.
NEUT7|So we're just going to use our PIP install.
NEUT8|Yahoo.
NEUT9|Finance.
NEUT10|So alright, we are going to be using this.
NEUT11|Two, it's a real simple package, but it has everything that you need to understand.
NEUT12|About the stock market.
NEUT13|So this is one of my original loves.
NEUT14|I found out about.
NEUT15|Bank accounts at about 8 years old, and then I found out about the stock market that.
NEUT16|You can you can own parts of companies and they will share that money with you and then on top of that it becomes more valuable overtime and somebody else will give you money for that.
NEUT17|I think that was what eight for the banks in about 12 for the stock market and I was hooked and then my third love Python And I've just kind of merged all these things together.
NEUT18|So we're going to now that we have some pandas background.
NEUT19|In a little bit now, we're going to be going out.
NEUT20|We know a little bit about interacting with the Internet and also.
NEUT21|We'll be delving more into it because we are seeing that I believe the last I looked today.
NEUT22|Beautiful soup is leading an we'll just do these in order so whatever, whatever comes in first will do that first, second, and third, and then we'll and we'll go from there.
NEUT23|But just real quick video today, just like everything else one topic moving on to the time and will build from it and we'll go from there.
NEUT24|So if you have any questions, comments, concerns, anything didn't understand this PIP.
BULL25|I've been having a lot of good discussions about that.
BULL26|That's probably one of the higher performing videos that I have so far.
NEUT27|But as always guys.
BULL28|Thanks for watching.
