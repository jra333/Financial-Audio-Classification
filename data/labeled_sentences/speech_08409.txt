NEUT0|"""From daily 4 axis is Chris taking a look at the WTI market?"
BULL1|You can see that we have rallied quite a bit from the $10 level over the last couple of days, but.
BULL2|Friday was very quiet and the $20 level above is previous support and now that we have rallied, it looks like we will see some selling in this area.
NEUT3|I do believe that you simply fade rallies and just continue to do that in this market.
NEUT4|I think we revisit 10.
BEAR5|Remember, at the end of the May contract we had people panicking and it actually went negative because there are very few places to store oil right now.
NEUT6|In fact, Goldman Sachs.
NEUT7|Has recently stated they think there is about three to four weeks worth of storage left, and then we're done.
BEAR8|That is going to put extreme negative pressure on this market so I'm not a buyer.
BEAR9|"I think that even above 20 there is probably a lot of selling all the way to 2250."""
