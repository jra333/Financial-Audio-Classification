NEUT1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, Joe Biden is good for Neo stock.
NEUT2|Let's get started.
NEUT3|It is now official that Joe Biden will be the 46th American President and he will remain there for four years.
NEUT4|The Biden administration will take over office on January 20th and lead the country for the next four years.
BULL5|This administration will be very good news for NEO stock.
NEUT6|The Biden administration is looking to make the country's decisiveness towards electric vehicles a thing of the past.
NEUT7|President Joe Biden was recently quoted saying I see electric vehicles as the future of transportation.
NEUT8|I am looking to swap government fleet vehicles with electric made vehicles and offer a system of rebate incentives for customers who replaced gas cars with electric vehicles.
BULL9|Wall Street analysts Cindy Lewis said this is good.
NEUT10|Joe Biden news for nail and other electric vehicle manufacturers.
BULL11|It will help more Americans to be electric vehicle oriented and purchase electric vehicles.
BULL12|This will help all electric vehicles stocks, but especially Neo, as it is already ahead of other electric vehicle companies in terms of technology on Neo Day.
NEUT13|Now released their new at 7 sedan with 150 kilowatts per hour.
NEUT14|Battery pack and Lidar technology.
BULL15|According to analysts, the car is better than its competitor from Tesla Model 3 and why vehicles?
NEUT16|Back in 2018, Nile discussed plans to enter the United States with an electric crossover vehicle and with the Biden administration in play and their new sedan about to hit the market.
NEUT17|All things seem possible for Neo in the United States.
NEUT18|Just a month ago we thought Neo will expand to Europe only due to tax benefits and as over 50% young Europeans love electric vehicles.
BULL19|However, now there might be similar tax breaks in the United States as in Europe.
BULL20|To promote the sale of electric vehicles, Nile received more good news from Biden administration as there will be tax breaks to promote the sale of electric vehicles.

BULL22|I think this can make Nile go much higher within the next five years as Joe Biden gives tax incentives for electric vehicles.
BEAR23|Joe Biden administration will increase capital gains and income tax for wealthy, which is a very bad idea.
BULL24|This might not be good for the market, but Luckily US electric vehicle investors will get more good news the Biden administration worth for electric vehicles outweighs higher taxes and NEO is not American company, so they will not be as much affected.
BEAR25|Neo haters are wrong.
