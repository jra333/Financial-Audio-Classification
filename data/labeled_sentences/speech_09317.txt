NEUT0|"""Three, when it comes to stocks, are we still in a bull market?"
NEUT1|I don't think so.
NEUT2|I think that the bull market was going to end and you always wondered guy what was going to end the whole process and if it was not the coronavirus it might have been eventually high valuations and fear that would have done.
BEAR3|It would have turned the market, but now I think we are in a very veritable bear market and there is more to come.
NEUT4|What kind of levels are you?
NEUT5|Are you talking about?
NEUT6|I 3000 on the S&P obviously is a level people are now watching very carefully by.
NEUT7|By the end of this year, or we significantly below where we are now, or kind of where we are now, where I how much of how much I would sell off?
NEUT8|Are we going to see?
NEUT9|Well we had 3043 on the SNP guy?
NEUT10|That's only 43 points about the 3000 figure.
NEUT11|My expectation is that you would cross 3000 before too long.
NEUT12|I don't want to say what day.
NEUT13|But if the coronavirus spread in the United States happens to be verified at what we found yesterday in California, which is unrelated to any travel related person, and if that's how it spreads and that means there is more in the society currently existing.
BEAR14|None of that is discounted in the S&P 500 prices, which is why my expectation is it will go below 3000 and it is hard to say what where it drops.
NEUT15|But 3000 is an easy number for me guy.
BEAR16|Well, so this is the 34th settle for more than 6% since 1953, and obviously not all, not even very many of those resulted in a stock market that was lower a year later if.
BEAR17|There is indeed an outbreak in the United States.
NEUT18|Is everything priced in at this point or do we get a further sell off?
BEAR19|Yeah, I think you get a further sell off when you find out that the coronaviruses spread, but there is going to be a bottom.
NEUT20|Equities are going to be a buy and bonds at some point would become a cell, but that is not yet.
NEUT21|Where would that come?
NEUT22|I would expect Bonnie it'll be 6 to 9 months from now.
NEUT23|I stick to the forecast I made on your program that the US recession will begin.
NEUT24|In mid 2020, so that's not too far away.
NEUT25|And once that happens and we are about 6 to 8 months into that recession of 2020, 2020 to 2021, that is when the bottom would be reached on the equity market.
BULL26|"It would be a tremendous buy after that."""
