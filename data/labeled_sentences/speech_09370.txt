NEUT1|Let's have a look at the technicals of this stock and what's going on with option market and moving averages.
NEUT2|If before we get started, if you guys could like the video, subscribe to the channel.
BULL3|I would really, really appreciate that.
NEUT4|Alright 2850, that's where it is.
BULL5|On Monday, March 15th and for the day it's up six point, 7% so far.
BULL6|And also it did get over this resistance level.
BEAR7|I was watching $27.00 level resistance right there.
BEAR8|It did reject there right there on Friday, got over, but couldn't hold onto it.
NEUT9|But now on Friday on Monday, this level is acting as a support.
NEUT10|Now since stock is trading above that resistance, if I zoom out the daily chart.
NEUT11|Next level of resistance for this stock is 3250 thirty 270.
NEUT12|Those are the levels and if it gets over that then next level of resistance I would watch is 3536.
NEUT13|All levels OK and also let me bring up the moving averages and let's have a look at that.
NEUT14|If we take a look at this yellow line this is 50 day simple moving average and the blue one right there is a 20 day moving average.
NEUT15|The good thing is today that this stock is.
BULL16|Bouncing off of 50 day, which is good.
BULL17|It is above for the first time.
NEUT18|For the past five six trading sessions so.
NEUT19|And the only thing I don't like so far is the volume it's trying to go up with.
NEUT20|There's not much volume if let me take let me zoom into this volume a bit.
NEUT21|So if we take a look at this volume right there, volume bars for the past.
BEAR22|These days, 6-7 trading sessions, it's been declining.
NEUT23|Wild stock is trying to go higher, so that's the only thing I don't like so far, but it's trying to go higher now.
NEUT24|Let's have a look at options what's going on so far on Monday.
NEUT25|So if we take a look at the option stats for today, the volume call volume 120,000, pretty decent, puts 27,000 so far.
NEUT26|That's the volume.
NEUT27|Now let's have a look at the transactions.
NEUT28|What people are looking for.
NEUT29|I'm going to take a look if there's any bats like going forward like March, not March like summer or like fall at least like six months out.
NEUT30|I'm looking for big big contracts.
NEUT31|Let's take a look.
BULL32|So far I'm seeing a lot of OK 28.27.
NEUT33|But 27 call for this week, March 19th a lot of March 19th.
NEUT34|Only one contract right here is a $50 puts for January.
NEUT35|20th 2020 2023.
NEUT36|Oh wow, that's the only big order I'm seeing.
NEUT37|It could be someone sold a put.
NEUT38|I'm not sure that's the only something I'm looking at with the long term, but for the most part, look at it.
NEUT39|All these big orders mainly came in for short term pretty much short term speculation.
NEUT40|That's what's going on with this stock so far on Monday and those are the levels I'm watching so.
