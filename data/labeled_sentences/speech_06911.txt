NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Dave Aquino at base camp Trading looking at Amazon today at a number of good opportunities for some trades in Amazon."
BULL1|You can see initially we gapped up at the open, had a consolidation pendant right here and then broke lower, filled the gaps or gap fill trade.
NEUT2|Then nice rebound.
BEAR3|And then we came in all the way down to roughly 967 and this fell for about 18 minutes.
BULL4|And from this move we actually got a very nice retracement.
BULL5|Trade up a double top bearish divergent so we got a partial retracement.
NEUT6|Here retest of this pivot high and then a very substantial move.
NEUT7|Now these moves like this, you're talking at 5-6 dollars at a time, so a lot of good opportunity to make money.
NEUT8|Here's a small bounce now.
NEUT9|Right now we have a descending wedge.
BEAR10|We have decreasing momentum and here it is roughly before.
NEUT11|A little bit after one o'clock, I'm actually looking at this to potentially in this case break lower mailing because the SNP is in the NASDAQ.
BEAR12|Is also looking weaker now.
BULL13|Do definitely have seen a reversal like this with a move back to the upside, possibly 972.
NEUT14|So back and forth.
NEUT15|We go and Amazon.
BULL16|"Lot of good intraday opportunities to trade."""
