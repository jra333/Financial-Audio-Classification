BEAR0|"""It was supposed to be one of the largest IPO's of the year, but the shared office group we work was instead plunged into crisis after investors failed to buy into its valuation of $47 billion or its promises of elevating the world's consciousness."
BEAR1|The IPO was called off and the chief executive resigned.
NEUT2|But what exactly is Wework?
NEUT3|Put simply, it rents out office space, decorates it in a distinctive style, and rent it out on all inclusive deals to businesses ranging from startups to Facebook and HSBC.
BULL4|It's grown at a breakneck pace.
BULL5|In recent years it's become the largest private tenant in Manhattan and central London.
NEUT6|The former chief executive Adam Newman, previously told the FT it was about much more than office space.
NEUT7|A lot of times people ask me if we compete against coworking spaces or against Regis, and the answer is no.
NEUT8|We're competing against office.
NEUT9|We're changing the way people work.
NEUT10|The one of the ways that really differentiates us is community.
NEUT11|But we works.
NEUT12|Quick expansion came at a price.
BEAR13|As the company grew bankrolled by its biggest investor SoftBank, its losses have ballooned.
BEAR14|Last year it reported a loss of $1.6 billion on sales of 1.8 billion.
NEUT15|They combine three things that, when put together, a very, very dangerous or difficult.
NEUT16|When you have losses like very big losses when you have opacity, we're very, very difficult to analyze because you haven't provided details and arrogance.
NEUT17|So when companies are difficult to analyze, then the trust of the management team becomes more important.
NEUT18|And when investors looked hard at this team to see if there was a team here that they could trust, I think that's when things started to unravel for this process.
NEUT19|Another problem for investors was the way we work.
NEUT20|Is run this is the business structure they submitted when they were hoping to list.
NEUT21|It's a structure known as a UPC, which offers tax benefits to early investors.
NEUT22|It also creates different share classes.
NEUT23|The former chief executive Newman would have had 20 times as many votes per share as ordinary shareholders.
BEAR24|Investors were worried about his levels of control and other deals like his decision to charge the company almost $6 million to use the word we.
BEAR25|After an outcry, that decision was reversed.
BEAR26|Now Mr. Newman is out the new Co. Chief executives have signaled a slimming down of the company and they're selling off its private jet, which Newman used to travel the globe, in which the company bought just last year for $60 million.
BULL27|But some landlords still think we work has huge potential.
NEUT28|Mike Hussey of London based Almacantar owns one of we work's largest sites.
BULL29|He says businesses are flocking to we workspaces.
NEUT30|What we work have done is said.
NEUT31|We think modern companies want something completely different.
NEUT32|They want to fully serviced often operation, the ability to locate along like mind alongside like minded people and we are prepared to wrap the whole thing together, provide you with space that really works for your staff, provide you with the flexibility to do what you want to do in your space and provide you with all the support mechanisms that you need in order to occupy that space.
NEUT33|And that is where the market and they've stolen the mid March on the market.
NEUT34|That is where the market is really changed.
NEUT35|The new Co chief executives will now have to make that case to investors and we works worried staff.
BULL36|"The company plans to drastically slow its expansion to avoid running out of cash, but it faces an uphill battle to show that we work really is at the Vanguard of a real estate revolution and not just another bloated Unicorn that couldn't stand up to scrutiny."""
