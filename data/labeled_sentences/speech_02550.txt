NEUT0|"""March 3rd is in the books here on Wall Street."
NEUT1|Here's the New York minute.
BEAR2|We've had a quiet end to an eventful week.
BULL3|Stocks were only just up the day.
NEUT4|The big action was in the dollar.
BEAR5|This is what's happened to the dollar over the last four days.
NEUT6|You can see the big rise on Tuesday evening when Bill Dudley of the New York Fed made it fairly clear we were going to see a rate rise later this month.
NEUT7|Today we had a speech from Janet Yellen, his boss, basically confirming that, and we had confirmation of the old adage of by the rumor sell the news.
BEAR8|The dollar actually weakens.
NEUT9|On that news.
BEAR10|Meanwhile, if we take a look at the dollar in longer term perspective of the broad real dollar, you can see that there is still a lot of room for the dollar to go higher that could yet be a problem for President Trump.
NEUT11|Meanwhile, if we take a look more broadly across the world as how cyclical stocks are doing compared to defensives, you can see that there's still not that much clarity for a lot of people about whether we really are seeing a cyclical upturn and ask for Mr. Trump's plans here in the US, this is our infrastructure stops doing compared to the rest of the market.
NEUT12|"Infrastructure investors still need to be shown the money before they get excited, and that's the New York Minute."""
