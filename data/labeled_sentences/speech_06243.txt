BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Firstly I just want to take more for having me on his channel.
NEUT2|Little bit of both me.
NEUT3|My name is Brian.
NEUT4|I am 27 and I live in Cork, Ireland and I currently work in the financial sector.
NEUT5|I got engaged at the end of last year, so since then there has been a lot more emphasis on saving towards a house, an wedding.
NEUT6|So each month once we get paid, we put away a set amount into our house and mortgage slash wedding funds.
NEUT7|Would I feel that one of the main reasons why I actually started my own investing portfolio as well is actually because it keeps me saving.
NEUT8|So even though it's investing, it technically is saving as well, so at the moment we have about 8200.
NEUT9|You're so invested in the market which creates for $10,000, so I feel that if I actually didn't start this investing portfolio, I would probably spend that money foolishly over the last 12 months.
NEUT10|My overall goal or objective would within this channel is to get $100,000 invested into the market.
NEUT11|There we can see on screen here that we're currently â‚¬8278, which equates to 10,000 USD.
NEUT12|So at the moment we're about 10% of the way through our overall goals.
NEUT13|So in terms of value versus dividend stocks, I have a mixture of both wrote My Portfolio at the moment we have Turkey unstuffed.
NEUT14|Overall I can see the pros and cons for holding both dividends and kind of value or growth stocks.
NEUT15|So in my opinion it's always imperative to have both as you have the best of both worlds.
NEUT16|Dividend stocks such as Coca Cola, for example, really do pay off and compound over years of vesting, but you shouldn't have kind of all those socks older because the only upvotes A6 or 8% a year annually.
NEUT17|So I do feel that you should have a sprinkle of growth or slash.
NEUT18|Riskier stocks within your portfolio.
NEUT19|And again I suppose it all depends what age where your risk tolerance and watch overall objectives after investing in another sector that I like that my commerces appraised and it's probably boring sector exposes the financial sector.
NEUT20|It's probably because I'm kind of threatening to fire job I suppose and well, but at the moment we can even see on screen here over 33%, which I'm quite happy with because usually the financial sectors don't really move a whole after the kind of boring industry where it goes up a few percent here and there, but I think I bought in at a good relative price just at the start of the crash last year or a few months into the crash.
BULL21|So I think it was kind of more than look more than anything that were up 33% for.
NEUT22|Yeah again, it's another sector that a lot of people kind of overlook, but I like it.
NEUT23|Myself, if you do want to get better at investing or anything financial related, you do need to take the time and there's no kind of get rich quick scheme and there's no quick way to do so.
NEUT24|You really do have to put into Grafton.
NEUT25|Tell human effort if you do want to make it work, so I just want to say thanks very much to move for actually taking the time to invite me into his channel.
BULL26|It reads mean a loss that he reached out to me and he certainly is a great guy that takes a lot of pride in his work.
BULL27|"So again, thanks very much to move and I wish you all the best in the future."""
