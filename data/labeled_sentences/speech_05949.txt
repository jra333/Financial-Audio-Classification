BULL0|"""Shopify has turned out to be an extraordinary platform and I'm using again an index of private companies."
NEUT1|I'm an investor in watching how they've been maneuvering for the last five and six months, and you know, when people look at a typical portfolio of American companies servicing American markets, you know, domestic, you know the 68% of the GDP is small business in America, and I'm very close to what they're doing.
NEUT2|They typically were 50% in retail, 40% with Amazon.
NEUT3|That's occurred over the last decade.
BEAR4|And 10% on their own websites to consumers retail shut down effectively in most locations.
NEUT5|And So what many of them have done has combined digital platforms like a Facebook with a Shopify so they can connect directly with their customers.
NEUT6|So if you had a store in Nashville, TN and it's closed now, you go to Shopify.
NEUT7|The reason you do that instead of putting more demand on Amazon distribution, Amazon is morphed into another retailer.
BULL8|Margins are close to 50%.
NEUT9|Only if you can sell direct to your customer in a town like Nashville and your sales drop in half, your net cash flows are the same.
NEUT10|So what has a curd here?
NEUT11|And I've got dozens of examples of this.
NEUT12|You reach out to that customer, you sell them direct.
NEUT13|Shopify combined with Facebook.
NEUT14|I was so hoping.
BEAR15|The Facebook bashing would push that stock down an I admire those that need to bash Facebook.
NEUT16|Can I beg them to do more of it?
NEUT17|Let me buy that stock at a lower price.
NEUT18|Go hit him again.
NEUT19|It doesn't work anymore because the platform is so efficient.
NEUT20|OK, quick follow up to you.
NEUT21|Can you own both Amazon and Shopify?
NEUT22|Because or do you have to own them both because they cover both sides?
NEUT23|That merchant seller spectrum?
NEUT24|Or are they going to?
NEUT25|Ultimately, you know, sort of take each other out.
NEUT26|No, no, no you can own the both.
NEUT27|My point is forward.
NEUT28|And by the way, let me tell you how much I love Amazon as a shareholder and a customer.
NEUT29|I don't want to say anything bad about them.
NEUT30|They're 40% of my sales across the portfolio of over 50 companies.
BULL31|They're very important, but for every incremental dollar I can do on Shopify, I'm getting almost 100% gross margin there.
NEUT32|The Anti Amazon Amazon puts their brand tape around the box.
NEUT33|They stick other peoples products beside mine.
NEUT34|Nobody knows what's arriving at their store when I ship a Shopify product.
NEUT35|It's got my smiling face all over at my brand on it and 100% gross margin.
NEUT36|They can exist together but these partnerships like Walmart with Shopify, Shopify with Facebook.
NEUT37|This is the new emerging market for small business in America and you need to own it.
NEUT38|That's my opinion as an investor and I live and breathe it every day.
NEUT39|"I love Amazon, but I love, love, love Shopify."""
