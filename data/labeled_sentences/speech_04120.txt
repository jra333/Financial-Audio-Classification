NEUT0|"""But let's start with the deal."
NEUT1|I'm reading a press release and I'm going to need you to translate it for me in our viewers.
NEUT2|Tell me why it matters.
BULL3|You said you know that the EC2 instances that will leverage up to 8 Cabana Goudy accelerators and deliver up to 40% better price performance than current graphics processing unit based EC2 instances for machine learning workloads.
NEUT4|Alright, what does that mean and why does it matter?
NEUT5|I think that first David were.
NEUT6|It's a pleasure to see.
BULL7|You were very excited about this announcement.
BULL8|I think over over the last several years we've been on a strategy to dramatically evolve the different architectures required for today's compute environment.
NEUT9|And we call that going from the the CPU or the central processing unit.
NEUT10|The brains of the PC to a multitude of architectures that includes one of the fastest growing architectures of AI chips.
NEUT11|So we have CPU's, GPU's, AI chips and Fpgas broad architecture offering the importance of this announcement today.
NEUT12|Is Havana AI accelerator chips is a company that we acquired just about a year ago.
BULL13|And it was to expand our capabilities, and in the fastest growing segment of the market, AI chips, in particular accelerators for AI, deep learning, training, deep learning models.
BULL14|So it's it's again one of the fastest growing segments of the market.
BULL15|An Amazon is the largest player in cloud service, providing to incorporate invalidate this Habana technology in its environment to deliver high performance, better productivity.
BULL16|For its clients is a very important deal for our Obama team and also for our strategy to expand beyond just the CPU to what we call the XP you environment.
NEUT17|Alright, I I think I have a better understanding of it now now.
NEUT18|How broad is the market here?
BULL19|I would assume obviously there's an opportunity well beyond the deal you announced yesterday.
BULL20|Yeah, I think the the the AI market overall is one of the fastest growing segments of the market and you know we expect it to be about a $25 billion market overtime today.
NEUT21|We have a very strong position in what's called inference chips.
BULL22|The announcement today is about the training chips was one of the faster growing aspects of AI overall, so we expect this is going to be a large market and this is an extension of our abilities to play a more important role throughout the entire.
NEUT23|Global infrastructure and obviously being part of a WS is a big deal for us.
NEUT24|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT25|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
