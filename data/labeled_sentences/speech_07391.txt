NEUT12|All right Next up we have DCP midstream, stock symbol, DCP.
NEUT13|This is video #14 of 19 for the upgraded stack series.
NEUT14|If you want to watch from the beginning, click on the link in the description down below.
NEUT15|Not getting the DCP we've gotten and this upgrade analyst price Target $27.00 a share.
NEUT16|Currently the stocks at about 2221.
BULL17|So we've got about five points in upward potential, which is approximately 20%.
NEUT18|I think it's important to point out that this company is not making money.
BULL19|However, they were upgraded so we get into a little bit about what they do together with subsidiaries own, operate and acquire and develop a portfolio of midstream energy assets in the United States.
BEAR20|Several other brokerages have recently issued reports on DCP Credit Suisse Group boosted their price target on shares of DCP Midstream from 21 to 24, and it gave the company a neutral rating in research reports on Wednesday, February 17th, which wasn't too long ago.
BULL21|Now upgraded to $27.00 a share.
BULL22|Citigroup also upgraded midstream to 23 on Thursday, January 21st.
BULL23|Barclays upgraded them to equal weight and up to 25.
BULL24|So they've have endless upgrades all over the place and this is usually a pretty bullish sign.
NEUT25|Now I want to take a look at the technicals on this.
BEAR26|Taking a look at the long term chart, we see I believe coronavirus here knocked it down off of its already downtrend.
BEAR27|From 25 all the way down to about $3 a share, that's a massive drop.
BULL28|They've been recovering and then at the upper end of the recovery, I believe.
NEUT29|Now I want to look a little closer.
BULL30|I see this upward trend.
BULL31|I see this support right here in about 21 bucks a share.
BEAR32|I personally think that we will see a bit of a pullback here.
NEUT33|An opportunity to buy in the 20 ones.
NEUT34|21 ish somewhere in the 21 inch to 22 with the price target.
NEUT35|Up there at about 27, which is up there right around the top, I think it's 26 would be a safe out.
NEUT36|If you were to buy this, there's a lot of analysts upgrades on this, so the idea that they're not making money could should always be a consideration as well.
NEUT37|So do your research if you want to.
NEUT38|If you want to buy this stack.
NEUT39|I personally I'm on the fence about it still and anytime I'm on the fence on buying a stock, I don't buy it because there's just too many opportunities out there.
NEUT40|So there you go, DCP midstream.
NEUT41|"We'll see on the next one."""
