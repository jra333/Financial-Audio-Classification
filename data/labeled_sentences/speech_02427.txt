NEUT1|If you guys are interested in starting to invest for yourself on Robinhood go ahead and click the link in my description for a free stock.
NEUT2|Mickey Mouse anti semitism Nazi sympathizer, childhood memories.
NEUT3|All these things are synonymous with one company, Disney today I'm going to be doing an update in analysis.
NEUT4|I know I did a video before on whether or not it's still a good time to buy in the Disney stock.
NEUT5|What's going to jump over to Robin Hood?
NEUT6|Will closer look at it.
NEUT7|Amit when I was just a child, my parents tried to ditch me at Magic Mountain, but the Disney security officers wouldn't let them God blossom.
BEAR8|Disney took a major hit when the virus took Ahold in USA.
NEUT9|If you go to the one year graph you can see it.
NEUT10|It took a big tip there.
NEUT11|Those trading around 100 and.
NEUT12|$40 a share before the virus.
BEAR13|As its lowest 85, it's at 124.
BULL14|It still got room to grow back up.
BEAR15|As you can see, I'm actually down overall on it, but I've bought and sold this before so it's really positive.
BULL16|Not negative, but I think it's still not a bad time to buy in.
BULL17|One the virus hit there to shut down their parks and that definitely her income there still having fully rebounded from it.
NEUT18|Yeah, you're the parks are only partially open, not fully.
NEUT19|But they're working on it, and for me, one of the reasons I have so much confidence in this company is when you invest in it.
NEUT20|You're not just investing in like 1 company, you're investing in amusement Park, a movie studio studio, streaming service, a channel on cable, endless merchandise, a hotel chain, the list goes on this, you know it's Monopoly.
NEUT21|One of the largest entertainment companies entire world.
NEUT22|You know, once a virus has run its course.
BULL23|Unlikely watched stock price rapidly grow.
NEUT24|Let's go and look at some of the systec ticks here.
NEUT25|Check out how we're doing as you can see they have a little bit of a dividend, which is nice.
BULL26|52 Week high of $253.
NEUT27|You know, and if you go down here, it's at 62% by not bad.
NEUT28|And you know, here's another reason why.
NEUT29|It's a good reason to buy Disney King Jong Hoon of North Korea faked his own ******* death to go to Disney World in Japan.
NEUT30|This guy literally has 8,000,000 people.
NEUT31|He could make them do whatever he wanted.
NEUT32|You like 8,000,000 slaves and he goes to Disneyland.
NEUT33|That's how cool it is, don't you think?
NEUT34|If you had 8,000,000 people willing to do your bidding, you wouldn't have to go to the amusement park, wait, only fix it.
NEUT35|A capitalist American amusement park.
NEUT36|In a Democratic country.
NEUT37|Yeah, so if that doesn't speak volumes you know, don't bother buying the stock.
NEUT38|And I'm, well, that's really all I have today like comment and subscribe.
NEUT39|For more.
