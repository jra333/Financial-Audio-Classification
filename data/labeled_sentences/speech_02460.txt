NEUT0|"""I'm joining us now with her thoughts and all of this is Tiffany McGee, CEO and Chief Investment Officer at Pivotal Advisors."
NEUT1|What do you make of that?
BULL2|Yeah, I totally agree.
NEUT3|So Disney was actually one of my picks actually took that survey so just want to take you guys back to pre pandemic.
NEUT4|So Disney 30% roughly 30% of their revenue was coming from parks and so this is one of these stocks that is a staple for me.
NEUT5|I've owned for a very long time and they were really able to quickly pivot release like titles like Mulan Direct to Consumer Really.
BULL6|Kind of stand on their streaming business, but now that the world is reopening, especially this year when more people are going to be in the vaccine and parks are really going to boost, I'm really looking for great things from Disney, so I'm super excited.
BULL7|And I agree with that with what most people said, so I'm glad that I was validated.
NEUT8|Let's let's talk just a little bit about this study.
NEUT9|In some of these reopening stocks, 50% of our survey respondents said they'd rather buy Hilton Worldwide than Air B&B or Live Nation.
NEUT10|What do you make of that?
NEUT11|Yeah, so I totally disagree.
NEUT12|So here's my theory.
NEUT13|On on Air B&B in my pick was Air BNB which I would take any day, but you know Hilton is a little bit tempting in Live Nation is a little bit tempting but for me so just look at some of these numbers right so I think like Joe earlier said that 97% actually yeah another survey was saying that people were planning to take a trip in the next 12 months.
NEUT14|I think that we need to really pay attention to the fact that we have this work from.
NEUT15|Anywhere kind of situation right now and that things have definitely changed.
BULL16|Also, leisure travel is really kind of boosting, boosting the recovery right now.
BULL17|If Airbnb were a hotel chain it would be bigger than the top five hotel brands in the world combined, and I think that you know with all of these new opportunities to work from home or really work from anywhere that people are going to take advantage of that.
NEUT18|And if you don't believe me, try to go book an Air B&B right now out like that.
NEUT19|Like the like, the next two months I tried to do it actually last night and it was super hard to do, but I can get a hotel room anywhere in like 5 seconds.
NEUT20|OK, let's try financials.
NEUT21|So this is the result from the survey.
NEUT22|48% of our respondents said they'd rather by JP Morgan then Goldman Sachs or PayPal, and none of the respondents said they'd buy square where yet.
NEUT23|Yeah, so for me it's a toss up between JP Morgan and Goldman.
NEUT24|I went with JP Morgan.
NEUT25|Those two are actually like Staples in My Portfolio.
BULL26|Again taking you back to the beginning of this kind of global economic shutdown, JP was able to some extent Goldman but JP was able to really, really do well in that in that first quarter when a lot of other regional banks were really struggling and really kind of throughout the pandemic.
BULL27|With their diversified our revenue streams I really like.
NEUT28|It's all a company, solid management, love Jamie Dimon.
NEUT29|And from from an ESG perspective, you guys were talking earlier about, you know major corporations.
NEUT30|Kind of weighing in and really kind of weighing in on what's going on in Georgia and really, really kind of being activists.
NEUT31|That's an ESG.
BULL32|Vertical JP Morgan has been with their advancing black pathways has been very very aggressive in terms of.
NEUT33|You know diversity in terms of like hiring in terms of lending all of these things they've been working on for, I guess probably over like the past three years, not just in the past.
NEUT34|In the past year.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
