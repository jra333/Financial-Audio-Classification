BULL0|"""Welcome back to a brand new video."
NEUT1|So today we're going to talk about the bread B twos.
BULL2|I think these are going to go up.
NEUT3|They made a lot of pairs, but if these are going to go up, like I said, I've been starting to get into the online side of things.
NEUT4|I only got 2 pairs.
NEUT5|I know people got hundreds of pairs.
NEUT6|All the people who bought, but I got two pairs.
BULL7|I'm happy with that.
NEUT8|Hopefully I can start hitting a lot more very soon in the near future to give you guys the answer if you want to invest into bread.
NEUT9|B twos.
NEUT10|Kind of give you a summary on how easy on how easy is work.
NEUT11|Basically they do a lot of restocks, right?
NEUT12|Well they when they do restocks they do really big restocks and pretty self explanatory.
NEUT13|Market tanks for the creams as zebras, the wave runners when they do restocks for all of those I guess the OG colorways in away market is going to tank and so when we look at the bread V2 for example four months ago this was a $850 shoe and right now it's pretty much a $350.00 shoe so.
NEUT14|What I think is going to happen is obviously if there's no more big restocks like this, the shoes bound to go up at the minimum in the minimum to 600, and and if you look at the return for that, that's $250 profit per pair.
NEUT15|So I mean that's pretty good.
NEUT16|Say for example you have a lot of capital and you buy 100 pairs.
NEUT17|Of these you can pretty much make $25,000, so you tell me, I think that's a great investment, but always I'm really I'm better at.
NEUT18|Jordans that I am at uses.
NEUT19|But I mean this one.
NEUT20|I feel like it's pretty self explanatory.
NEUT21|These are going to go up if you're a new investor, at least buy one pair just to test out the market.
NEUT22|That's usually what I do when I invest in tissue.
NEUT23|I don't understand that well, I just buy like 1 shoe.
NEUT24|Test it out, see where it goes for this try and stick to either like really small sizes or just like medium sizes from size like 9 1/2 to 11.
NEUT25|Those usually will be great and you can sell them a lot quicker once they go up.
NEUT26|Am I going to do this investment?
NEUT27|You know I got two pairs for retail.
NEUT28|I can take 100 something plus profit right now.
NEUT29|I'm not going to do that.
NEUT30|I'm going to hold them, but I'm very tempted to buy literally 100 pairs for like 350.
NEUT31|I'm very tempted and a lot of people have pairs right now.
NEUT32|I think they're probably going to go up to honestly like 500 in the next.
NEUT33|I give it six months.
NEUT34|It's going to be 450 to 500 in the next six months.
NEUT35|Easy, so I'm pretty tempted because I know that I can make money, but at the same time I've never done a easy investment, so I guess we'll just have to see what happens.
NEUT36|That's it for today's video.
