BULL0|"""Amazon is really all about salsa, combination of sales and profitability here, so looking for total revenue growth."
NEUT1|About 35%.
BULL2|Slight moderation in the online growth versus Q3, but still strong growth.
BULL3|They had Prime Day in October as well, which should benefit them.
BULL4|Additionally, Amazon Web Services will be approximately 9% growth similar to Q3.
NEUT5|If you look at Microsoft was fairly similar, Q3 and Q4 as well.
BULL6|Looking for a fairly stable growth in the 30% range advertising growth.
BULL7|Amazon also looking for strong growth right around 38% year beer.
NEUT8|Slightly self interview.
BULL9|Free but strong there as well and then gap operating income about 4.4 billion number we're looking for.
BULL10|They still have a bit of a headwind from Covid, but we think that those comps will get easier in 2021 as well.
BULL11|From a Google side looking for net revenue growth, about 18%, that's actually an acceleration versus the 15% in Q3.
BULL12|Our channel checks generally indicating a re acceleration of growth as the economy reopened, specifically on search for looking for a 5 point acceleration from 6% in Q3 to 11% before and YouTube looking for a 7 point acceleration from 32% to 39 on the cloud side as you mentioned.
BULL13|Looking for strong growth there for Google as well.
NEUT14|About 44%.
BULL15|I think the profitability.
BULL16|Less important, at this point we want to see them continue to grow at a healthy rate and margins will come later.
BULL17|For both of these companies there, and we're going to come to a point where it's going to be more difficult.
NEUT18|Comps.
BULL19|Both of them did pretty well during the pandemic, particularly for Amazon.
NEUT20|So how does Amazon sort of keep the momentum going, and what is already priced into the stock at this point?
BULL21|Yeah, I definitely Amazon.
NEUT22|You're going to have tougher comps in 2021 on E Commerce side.
BEAR23|That was clearly a tailwind for a number of e-commerce companies.
BULL24|We are looking for moderating growth.
BULL25|Enter the 10 to 15% range, especially in Q2.
BEAR26|However, as we talked about you seen that big headwind, about $10 billion this year on the operating income side from kovit.
BULL27|We think that'll ease and 21 as well.
BULL28|So even though revenue growth will slow, you likely get some profit improvement in 2021.
NEUT29|On Google you actually have opposite situation we have.
NEUT30|Pretty tough, easy comps in Q2 as with Google search, people are doing less searches early on, especially this is specifically in the travel sector, which was a big headwind and we're starting to see every acceleration in travel spending as consumers start to anticipate maybe traveling in the second half of this year, and so comps on the search side as well as You Tube will be fairly easy and Q2 making it tougher as the year goes along.
NEUT31|Though, how should we think about the pick up and travel and Google?
NEUT32|You don't think of Alphabet as a reopening plate, but maybe investors should.
BEAR33|Yeah, we think travel is represents roughly 10% of their search revenues and that almost went to zero and kind of Q2 of last year.
BULL34|And so that's kind of pure kind of revenues that should come back, especially in the second half of the year.
BULL35|But even we're starting to hear that travel advertisers are starting to come back at a healthy pace even in Q1 here, anticipating that stronger second half recovery at this point so specifically in the travel set aside, we do expect a stronger growth there, which should boost overall.
NEUT36|Google search volumes that plus E Commerce continues to be the biggest part of Google Search.
BULL37|We're expecting a pretty decent 2021 for Google search revenues.
NEUT38|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT39|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
