NEUT1|He ran today on technical analysis.
NEUT2|We're talking all about match Group One of our stocks to watch now.
NEUT3|Sometimes a stock breaks out, but the rally doesn't result in a big gain in the stock pulls back.
NEUT4|However, that doesn't mean you should lose hope and you base could form, resulting in what we call a based on based pattern.
NEUT5|And it actually happens quite frequently in the stock market.
NEUT6|We're seeing it right now with match Group.
NEUT7|So let's take a look at this daily chart here.
BULL8|Now match staged a breakout over a Cup base with a 5810 by point on February 7th.
BEAR9|Now matches just reported earnings actually showed a decline of 22% on the bottom line and by the end of the session, much of the stocks gains had faded.
NEUT10|Putting it back below the buy point not only do earnings provide a potential risk when buying a stock, but this base was risky with a depth of 45% we already knew.
BULL11|That this base had a higher chance of failing matches.
BULL12|Now working on *** U Cup with handle base and you can see how the trading action here is tighter and esag is finding support along the 50 day line as it builds the base now matches about 6% below the potential by point here.
NEUT13|If match breaks out look for heavy volume as that indicates support from institutional investors and you always want to be following the big money when you're buying stocks.
NEUT14|You also want to keep an eye on the address line 2.
BULL15|Now a new high for the Rs line as the stock breaks out would be a confirming technical indicator.
NEUT16|Since the Rs line measures price performance versus the S&P 500.
BULL17|And while match is expected to see just 13% earnings growth in 2019, it's expected to re accelerate to 23% in 2020.
NEUT18|So All in all, make sure to be on the lookout for stocks working on a base on base pattern because the best stocks will really take advantage of a second chance breakout.
