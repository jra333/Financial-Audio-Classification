BEAR0|"""You seem lukewarm on this stock."
NEUT1|It's at 201 now and your price targets 185.
NEUT2|What are you expecting this afternoon and what do you see in the short to medium term for this company?
BULL3|Will Tyler, I do think the stocks gotten ahead of itself?
BULL4|It is up 40% off the lows, but it's not back near its highs and we think it's going to have some upside resistance.
NEUT5|The things I would watch for would be China, but we want to see how much that bounces back after the mess.
BEAR6|Last quarter they've cut prices there.
BULL7|How much impact did they have in turn in terms of market share gain services were looking for 17% growth in the App Store.
BEAR8|Looks like it slowed to maybe 15% last quarter, so we're watching for that.
NEUT9|And finally capital return.
NEUT10|We're looking for about a 10 to 12% dividend hike, an something over $50 billion buyback, so it is becoming more of a capital return story.
BULL11|Which I don't think is enough to get the stock higher.
NEUT12|From here, you know, Steve Kovac.
NEUT13|The stock has come back a good bit from that point, but not not not as much as has gone back to its highs as Steve Milanovic just pointed out, but there are a lot of unanswered questions here, including what's going to happen with this TV service and what are they going to charge for exactly?
NEUT14|That's the fascinating thing that's happened with Apple over the last three or four months.
NEUT15|They announced all these services, but didn't give a price for them.
NEUT16|We don't know how much that TV surface is going to cost.
NEUT17|We don't know how much the.
BULL18|Video gaming services being costs and people are still betting that they're going to be able to squeeze just a little bit.
NEUT19|A few pennies out of every other iPhone that's out there.
BULL20|There are a billion iPhones out there on the planet and investors are betting right now they're going to be able to squeeze more cash out of each one of those.
BEAR21|One of the things Steve Milanovic that leaps out at me is the slowing rate at which people are replacing their phones.
NEUT22|Absolutely.
NEUT23|And although some analysts argue, we're kind of at the limit of that nearing four years, I don't think we're quite there yet.
NEUT24|We have some survey data which suggests that the people who bought an iPhone this last quarter had held their previous phone 26% of their previous phone for over three years.
BEAR25|That compares to like 16% a year ago.
NEUT26|So you know, if you're spending $1000 on a phone, you're probably going to hold that phone for 3 1/2 years.
BEAR27|So I don't think we're quite at the limit yet, and that reduces your iPhone shipments.
NEUT28|Stevenage, I'm curious over here a little bit more.
NEUT29|You mentioned.
BEAR30|The App Store might be decelerating, and.
BEAR31|Josh Lipton also said this that maybe people are looking for the services business to actually decelerate for the next couple of quarters.
NEUT32|Why would that be?
NEUT33|Well, the App Store is the biggest part.
NEUT34|An on the last call.
BEAR35|IBM said the biggest part of our services business was less than 30% and if you do the numbers, we think that means the App Store slowed to 1516% growth.
BULL36|A lot of that's gaining in China, so some of that we do expect to come back as more games are approved.
BULL37|But nevertheless you know media is going to help as we begin to add that later this year.
BEAR38|But I don't see a deceleration down to 12%.
BEAR39|I do think you're going to see some pressure on that number.
BEAR40|Some people are worried that the Netflixes and others are going around Apple, I'm not.
NEUT41|Overly concerned about that at this time, but I do think we're going to see numbers in the mid to upper teens.
NEUT42|See if you want it right.
NEUT43|Yeah, he just mentioned gaming.
NEUT44|I thought that's really important.
NEUT45|This arcade service.
NEUT46|While we don't know all the details about the launch in the pricing of it, it does sound super compelling.
BULL47|Apple is wrapping up tons of deals exclusively that will be on the iPhone only, and so that means they'll be able to have this exclusive titles.
NEUT48|You pay 10 bucks a month or whatever it might be and you get.
NEUT49|But is that enough to?
NEUT50|It's a little bit of a Tesla thing, right?
NEUT51|Where it's like?
BEAR52|Don't look at our slowing sales now.
NEUT53|Look at the new stuff that we have exactly.
BEAR54|Yes, so that is a problem for them too.
BEAR55|It's it's the App Store is slowing, so they're really trying to do things.
NEUT56|If you go in the App Store right now today Kelly, you'll see they have a subscription section specifically for it.
NEUT57|Saying subscribe to our favorite apps, that's recurring revenue within the App Store there.
NEUT58|Figuring out little levers they can pull to really tweak that.
BULL59|"An gain revenue inside the App Store, still."""
