NEUT0|"""Meantime, let's bring in Justin Jen, the co-founder and president of Think, Numb Alternative Data which tracks stock chatter on Reddit."
NEUT1|Wallstreetbets board Justin.
BULL2|Great to have you with us.
NEUT3|Thanks for having me so you track the number of mentions stocks have on wallstreetbets.
NEUT4|What do you use with that data?
NEUT5|How is that useful?
NEUT6|Yeah well, so let me start by saying what we do in general.
NEUT7|So we tracked alternative data from the web so we can track like where a company is opening and closing stores, who the hiring and social media is obviously a big part of that, especially with credit recently.
NEUT8|So what investors really want to know is what are these stocks that people on Reddit are talking about.
NEUT9|And then they use that to either potentially no one's stock could run up, or more importantly for risk management.
NEUT10|So if I have a portfolio.
NEUT11|And one of my stocks start getting talked about that I want to know about that as soon as possible.
NEUT12|So when you observe the chatter and you observe this activity on social media adjustment, do you make a judgment or do you analyze the data to determine whether it's positive or negative?
NEUT13|'cause even from a risk management perspective, if your portfolio manager, I mean the people in red, it could be on the same side of the trade, or completely opposite as we saw in GameStop, it doesn't help you unless you know directionally how that commentary in wallstreetbets.
NEUT14|Is couched.
NEUT15|So we provide kind of the number of occurrences for a stock on Reddit, and we provide the comments we don't like, say, hey, this comment is positive and negative because that can be kind of arbitrary, but our investment, our investor clients and some of the corporations that uses data.
NEUT16|They have a lot of tools to do that sentiment analysis on their own.
NEUT17|I will say that a lot of the you know most people on Reddit and go long so.
NEUT18|That the use case right now is if I'm short a stock that I want, no, because you know, like a lot of these runners are on the long side, not the short side.
NEUT19|OK, well, let's talk about the latest stock you picked up in terms of Chatter on Reddit, and that would be Palantir.
NEUT20|What are you seeing there?
NEUT21|Yeah, sure.
NEUT22|So Palantir is an interesting one because it's a bit of the company's supposed to be to see companies which basically everything else is.
BEAR23|So we're seeing in recent days the amount of chatter is spiking again, and you know it's taking quite heavily about 30% over the past couple of days.
NEUT24|And yeah, you know, it's.
NEUT25|I think it's gonna be interesting to see what that does order next week days and and I think I asked you this at the beginning, but I'll ask you this again.
NEUT26|So you see, this chatter, is it predictive of unusual activity or is it coincident?
NEUT27|So in many cases it's been effective in some cases is coincident.
NEUT28|You know, we don't.
NEUT29|Again, we don't claim to like analyze it and say everything is defective, so we don't make that call.
NEUT30|But the reason why we have you know hundreds of hedge funds and kind of investors talking to us is because that there is there.
NEUT31|Is there a signal there?
BULL32|Alright, just some great to have you with us.
BULL33|We hope you'll join us again.
NEUT34|Bring us some more targets.
NEUT35|"Justin, Jen."""
