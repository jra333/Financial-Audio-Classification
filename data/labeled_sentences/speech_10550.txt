NEUT0|"""That leads right to the GE call, which I'm sure you guys are going to talk about."
NEUT1|Yeah, as they go to 17 Investor Day on the 10th boy a lot of that is about the strength of aviation.
BULL2|David feeding free cash flow.
NEUT3|Yeah $0.90 a share of free cash flow in 2023, says Morgan Stanley.
BULL4|Listen this stocks up 28% already this year.
BULL5|Comfort ubly above $100 billion.
BULL6|Market value is now GE at 121 plus billion dollar market value back to respectability.
NEUT7|Well, Larry culp.
BULL8|Obviously people getting on board with the turn around aviation is you said, Carl Morgan Stanley says appears to have significant recovery potential and looks conservative and guidance Jim.
NEUT9|Although when I think Culp, I tend to think adanna her sometimes they can't help it.
NEUT10|I mean you take a look at value creation.
NEUT11|Mean listen.
BULL12|GE seems to be on its way, rebounding had a very strong last quarter unexpectedly so at least versus what analysts were estimating.
NEUT13|Take a look at where Culp came from a Danaher though.
NEUT14|That thing has been unbelievable, by the way.
NEUT15|They probably were the beneficiary of the purchase that they made from Culp GE of that beloved Sciences.
NEUT16|Yes, thank you, said this was a part of the ambersham.
NEUT17|I mean, Emma was pointing that out but and they got a great price for it.
NEUT18|But Danaher guys can we put up a downer?
NEUT19|DHR just to just to take a look.
NEUT20|It's coming.
NEUT21|I just wanted to throw that up there.
NEUT22|'cause every time we talk about GE, well their big competitor with Thermo Fisher, another company that used to be very envious of GE's life science business.
NEUT23|Yes, cool pad to sell it.
NEUT24|They needed the capital.
NEUT25|I've been working with copon this win division and wind is now very economic, which is shocking and wind is a very big part of their business.
NEUT26|It was not the reason why Texas had a problem.
NEUT27|There's a big wind farm coming up near me and apparently I won't be able to see it in the Jersey Shore.
NEUT28|Coral wind.
NEUT29|We're a windy country.
NEUT30|And all the big data centers want to be located where there's wind and we forget.
NEUT31|I mean, we're more windy than sunny and Larry Culp he understands this stuff.
NEUT32|I was trying to get into green hydrogen and he was like, Jim, you know Jim.
NEUT33|Come on green hydrogen.
NEUT34|I like great.
NEUT35|He likes all the other color hydrogens.
NEUT36|'cause of the determined business.
NEUT37|David, you know when she is going to really get to the 20?
NEUT38|Tell me when they called him turbines and not to be.
NEUT39|That's what the problem is.
NEUT40|Yeah, turbid, so he didn't get the green hydrogen thing.
BEAR41|Didn't go over too well.
NEUT42|You're down your basement again once you bring it to GameStop, you're always coming up with new business models for that game.
NEUT43|Hydrogen cell, yeah absolutely OK yeah.
NEUT44|I mean he keeps 6 to my sent a memo in green hydrogen like four days later it came back as well.
NEUT45|I'm sorry, didn't look at it right.
NEUT46|He's like our hydrogen is never going to be right now.
NEUT47|He's right green hydrogen.
NEUT48|He said he's a realist.
NEUT49|I'm a dreamer.
NEUT50|Green eggs and ham we don't want to get you know they said no, no no no no no.
BEAR51|David I'm sorry.
NEUT52|What what?
NEUT53|He was a real left wing guy?
NEUT54|You know who Sois Geissel theater guys?
BULL55|Yeah, he was great.
NEUT56|If you watch that five who came back, did you ever watch the fire came back?
NEUT57|The unbelievable special about the books were all great.
NEUT58|Capra and he was the most left wing so we may not may not think that he's right right now, but at the time he was his his foundation that made that decision.
NEUT59|Shepard Smith here.
