NEUT0|"""OK, so how is it that there gonna be a company like expanse which shows you the same thing the bad guy?"
NEUT1|See how was that available?
NEUT2|I mean to me that is like I gotta have that.
NEUT3|How did you get that?
NEUT4|Well, I think Jim what's important is you've got to go see where the Buck is going, not where the **** was.
NEUT5|I think the puck is going where you know five years ago you couldn't scan the Internet on a regular basis and in a day five years ago you couldn't aggregate that data and stored cheaply to be able to look at it.
NEUT6|Fires where you can attribute that data to individual customers that are out there today.
NEUT7|Technology has made it possible.
BULL8|Now these guys have done a phenomenal job that work with various large governments around the world.
NEUT9|They work with large companies.
NEUT10|They actually have a visibility from the outside.
NEUT11|Most securities inside out.
NEUT12|You know, shut the door, shut the window, don't let anything bad happen to you.
BULL13|These guys OK, great.
NEUT14|Let's go take a look from the outside and say after done everything doing everything you done.
NEUT15|What do I get to see?
NEUT16|'cause that's what the bad guys we're seeing that's what the hackers are seeing.
NEUT17|So they spend 4-5 years building the capability creating that capability from the outside, not within.
NEUT18|The company is made above technical people will try to make sure this data is understood.
NEUT19|We can take that.
NEUT20|We can incorporate that into our product suite.
NEUT21|We can deploy it against our 2000 Global 2000 accounts are Fortune 100 accounts and show them the benefits.
NEUT22|Right on the gate.
NEUT23|So we're launching our user conference tomorrow morning.
NEUT24|Going to make all of our CIO and CISO sign up.
NEUT25|We give them the ability to get a free report to actually see from the outside what the bad guys are seeing now.
NEUT26|It's incredible.
NEUT27|That's incredible because you have these like red Team Blue team.
NEUT28|That's not good enough that those are people who are two good guys trying to hack.
NEUT29|You.
NEUT30|Need the bad guy mentality in this gives it to them.
BULL31|Yes, we're really excited about the team.
BULL32|Really excited about the acquisition.
NEUT33|Really excited about the possibility of incorporating that data feed, and we're going to combine the two.
BULL34|We have amazing inside out capability to bring outside in capability.
NEUT35|I think the future you'll find out that people will need both perspectives to actually have a comprehensive, secure solution in front of them.
NEUT36|And that's what we're aspiring to be.
