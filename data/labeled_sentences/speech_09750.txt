NEUT0|"""But it's a giacoma speaking."
NEUT1|Thanks a lot for watching this quick video on motor, Motor Ford Motor Company.
NEUT2|Buddy knows about 4th day.
NEUT3|It's one of the biggest automaker in the world.
NEUT4|And of course, before investing in this talk, it's better that, as usual, I suggest that you read a lot of news about four, the end or the other automakers worldwide, so as generally they tend to perform all and same way.
NEUT5|So following the same path or they babe exactly the same wave, so.
NEUT6|If perhaps forward, a school is moving upward, if you're gonna check.
NEUT7|Letty were balls bag.
NEUT8|It was bagging should follow the same path as well as perhaps if you check General Motors.
NEUT9|General Motors should follow the same path anyway in front of our city's fourth one hour candle stick and without any technical analysis by just using one of the most trustworthy tools that it's the exponential moving average or also the simple moving average.
NEUT10|That's the job it worked at.
NEUT11|Actually it works very well as almost support for those bottoms, even if they been broken for a couple of this is one hour kinda sick for a couple of days as well as we think was broken two times, but generally work very well for this bottom.
BULL12|So with the length of four and read it worked very well as support for this rally so generally just using this tool we can see if we can say that the market is a bullish market so.
NEUT13|The idea is always to based in the trend direction.
NEUT14|Sorry bout it and ideas to go long.
NEUT15|So now if we go Long Bull uptrend so going in uptrend bullish market so that yes as I told you to try to invest always in that in that direction.
NEUT16|So even if possible price retracement will start soon.
NEUT17|The best option is just too old now before going long.
NEUT18|So this is based on my technical analysis.
NEUT19|Interpretation and as we can see, the minimum minimum target price is 10.5 U.S. dollar.
NEUT20|The next one will be 11 and then 12 but before going long let's see what is going up in the next days.
NEUT21|Let's wait at the end of this possible price retracement before going longer.
NEUT22|There are two options they seen, let's say from from tomorrow when the market will open.
NEUT23|The stock can just start going up.
NEUT24|Reaching this target price and then again going down.
NEUT25|To taste the dessert and the line before going up again.
NEUT26|So the idea is that now.
NEUT27|We can go along because for a longer term investment ideas to go along, but for a short term you can lose some money if you go longer right now so that there would be wait a little bit, wait possible and price retracement before going log so that the overall is to go along for long term investment.
NEUT28|But for a short time there.
NEUT29|Maybe this this started my start menu price set back and just wait the end of these price set back before going long.
NEUT30|So in conclusion that is to go long by just wait the end of.
NEUT31|"Other possible price in placement thanks bye."""
