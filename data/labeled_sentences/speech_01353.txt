NEUT0|"""Hey, it's Glenn this via video chart on ticker symbol BLDP."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link, so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
BULL4|Nice bounce today on this one.
NEUT5|I mean when you stop and think about the fact that just on Thursday the prices all the way down there.
BULL6|But now it's been able to work its way back up to there.
NEUT7|Any rational person would say that the price is certainly made a nice move, not just comes to the town of the question of but is there any sort of true power behind this price movement?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT9|Dead Cat, Bounce type movement?
NEUT10|I have no idea, but by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and to my mind it all revolves around a single area and that area is down here at.
NEUT11|$9.10 Why is 910 important?
BULL12|Well, hopefully we can agree on the logic that price movements with genuine power were true strength.
NEUT13|The price is going to progress forward.
NEUT14|The price is not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT15|So with that in mind, think about 9:10.
BEAR16|If the price were to come down in that area.
NEUT17|And then just continue on down.
NEUT18|What would that be doing with the price?
NEUT19|Will from a very literal perspective that would be putting the price quite literally right back inside of that range that it just broke out of.
BULL20|And again going back, not exactly a sign of true strength.
NEUT21|On the flip side though, if the price comes down to this area.
NEUT22|Behave in that manner, then starts to work its way back upwards.
NEUT23|Then what would you have all of a sudden when all of a sudden you have a set of those?
NEUT24|There you have that set of those down there.
NEUT25|If you envision each of those, is there steps?
NEUT26|Well, hey, there you go.
NEUT27|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT28|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT29|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
NEUT30|So going forward as far as progress, it's all about $9.10.
NEUT31|On the flip side of things as far as areas of resistance are concerned, nothing fancy here.
NEUT32|It's all about that purple line there.
NEUT33|Which is the famous 50.
NEUT34|Simple moving average.
NEUT35|The price is definitely within striking distance of it.
NEUT36|I mean, it's got a little ways to go, but it's definitely close enough to think that there could potentially be a break out of that on Monday.
NEUT37|But we'll see what happens with it.
NEUT38|All in all, very nice bounce, not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum?
NEUT39|Let's see what happens.
NEUT40|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT41|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT42|But it will be me.
NEUT43|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL44|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT45|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT46|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR47|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT48|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT49|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT50|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT51|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT52|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT53|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
