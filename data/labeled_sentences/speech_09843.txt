BEAR7|Taking a look at the stock price right now in the after hours at the time of recording this, we're at $10.67 and we had a low of the day, $8.65.
NEUT8|So the Fireside chat just ended and I wrote down a bunch of notes here that I want to go over pretty much going over everything we learned today and overall is a lot better than I was expecting to be honest, it couldn't have gone much better than it did, so here's some things that we got to learn.
NEUT9|We found out about a lot of good information, and it looks like their plan.
NEUT10|Having around six netplan zeros in the pipeline.
NEUT11|Or a quick update on Net 01 plant.
BULL12|All we're waiting on is the engineering side of it, so the plant should be up and running by next year, which is great.
NEUT13|He also mentioned that they have the cash on hand for.
BEAR14|Net 0.2 and they even have a down payment for Netzero plant.
NEUT15|Three sticking to the topic of Net Zero plans.
BULL16|We also got a mention of them expanding internationally to Europe and India as far as expanding and they also explain how it takes around 18 months to get the plants up and running, which isn't too bad.
BEAR17|Other projects that were mentioned where their RNG projects going forward, an overall costs associated with these projects.
NEUT18|Another big factor that I spent some time talking about with how the contracts weren't in the whole process of getting contracts in new customers so the contracts are great for Gevo because they guarantee pay for Gevo because what they do is they set a minimum amount of fuel that the customer has to purchase each year.
NEUT19|So even if they don't decide to actually take the field, they're still paying for it.
NEUT20|One of the current contract negotiations talked about that was in the works, which is for 500,000,000 gallons of fuel.
NEUT21|Note this number was risk adjusted as they stayed in the presentation and this is for the six net zero plans.
NEUT22|So without this risk adjustment which they put it at about half the deal would be for about 1 billion gallons of fuel.
NEUT23|The price of the fuel is mentioned at $5.
NEUT24|This is also takes into account all the benefits of selling clean fuel.
NEUT25|Next up was the mention of an oil company which they said they were in talks with and we could hear more about a potential deal in six to nine months.
BULL26|So overall we learned a lot for this Fireside chat.
BULL27|There's a lot of exciting projects and news coming up as well as future contracts.
BULL28|So overall, the chat was much better than I was expecting.
NEUT29|There's a lot coming in this company and the stock price is a ton of room to grow over the course of the year, so the only negative anything from this is learning how long the plants actually take to get up and running.
BULL30|Other than that, everything was great.
NEUT31|So just to recap over everything we learned, we know that Jehovah might not have much production capabilities right now, or profit margin currently, but this will definitely change in the future patent.
NEUT32|Tim talked about plans for six net zero plants.
NEUT33|The total potential of 1 billion gallons of fuel, which they notice being 500,000,000 'cause they put into the account risk they adjusted for the risk.
BULL34|So they're currently making some headway in on a facility in India.
NEUT35|And there's an RNG facility that they're working on an Iowa, which should be up and running and functional in the next year.
NEUT36|And Lastly, they hinted at some of the loans being confirmed, so for my price predictions going forward, I think we'll see $15 by the end of the month and closer to the end of the year.
NEUT37|I think we'll see somewhere over $50, if not higher than that.
NEUT38|So what did you guys think of the Fireside chat?
NEUT39|Let me know what you guys thought of it as well as your price predictions down below.
