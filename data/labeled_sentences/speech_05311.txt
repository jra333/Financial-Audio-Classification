BULL0|"""Good morning traders."
NEUT1|My name is Mark and today we're looking at Amazon.
NEUT2|Williams unfollowed like a lot of the rest of the market.
BEAR3|You know they've been going on a downward trend for the past couple weeks, and then a lot of them found support.
BULL4|It looks like Amazon two days ago bounced off of this consolidation point here before we had that final run up to the new highs.
BEAR5|And then this morning, guys, we know we found resistance at what, 30, sixty and we're definitely have are gapping up this morning.
NEUT6|My initial price target would probably be around, you know 3000.
NEUT7|250 till we see some form of resistance.
NEUT8|So that's sort of if I was setting up a swing.
NEUT9|You know that's what I'm saying is that we should probably run up to about three twenty 3250, and after that we'll see if we start breaking above this resistance.
NEUT10|This resistance line then I could see us then running up all the way and.
NEUT11|You know at least 3400 again, but it all depends on this whole election or anything else.
NEUT12|So if I you know if I were you.
NEUT13|And I was doing this play.
NEUT14|No, I would potentially sell a portion of my position.
BULL15|At this new lease lock in some profits so that if you know if the trade is sideways, Alicia gained some.
NEUT16|If we break above, you can write it.
NEUT17|You know, just like this went up right?
NEUT18|You know, it can definitely go down, you know.
NEUT19|So as in this one close, you know around here and then all of a sudden the next morning we drop down.
NEUT20|You know how 50 points?
NEUT21|Similar thing here, right?
BEAR22|We closed you know at 3050 basically, and we're up over 100 points and market trading so, but that's it.
NEUT23|That's what we looked at Amazon.
NEUT24|Let me know what you think.
NEUT25|Let me know if you're going to get in.
NEUT26|Let me know if you like this video.
BULL27|"Thank you."""
