NEUT0|"""Boeing raised 25 billion just a day or two ago, and they raised 14 billion before that and."
BEAR1|A year ago they felt they weren't a fine cash position and I understand all that happened.
BEAR2|Airbuses had the same situation.
NEUT3|They've made some comments recently.
NEUT4|Within the last week, you know the fact that they.
NEUT5|That they really know what their future is, and I don't know what their future is.
NEUT6|I we're going to.
NEUT7|We're going to have aircraft in this country.
NEUT8|We're going to be flying, but the real question is whether you need a lot of new planes or not.
NEUT9|And when you when you're likely to need them and and it affects a lot of people, an it certainly affects Precision Castparts effects.
BEAR10|General Electric exactly obviously affects Boeing and.
NEUT11|It's it's.
BEAR12|It is a blow to essentially have.
BEAR13|Your demand dry up and it goes up, and the chain and.
NEUT14|You know that.
NEUT15|The aircraft manufacturers didn't.
NEUT16|They didn't bring it on themselves.
NEUT17|The airlines didn't bring it on himself.
NEUT18|Precision Castparts and bring ourselves General Electric didn't.
NEUT19|It's basically that we shut off air travel.
NEUT20|In this country and.
NEUT21|What that does to people's habits.
NEUT22|How they behave in the future.
NEUT23|It's just hard to evaluate.
NEUT24|I don't know the answer and.
NEUT25|But we do know that will have an effect on Precision Castparts and how severe it will be.
NEUT26|It depends on this same sort of variables that are heading bobingen.
NEUT27|You name the company in aircrafts and aircraft, so big business.
NEUT28|And this country is good at it.
NEUT29|Incidentally, too.
NEUT30|I mean, if you think about Boeing.
NEUT31|You know it is what a hell of a company and it's it's.
NEUT32|It's important.
NEUT33|It's a huge.
NEUT34|Exporter and.
BEAR35|It affects a lot of jobs.
BULL36|And Tom are with us and we hope for the best, and we wish everybody the best obviously.
BULL37|And we wish ourselves the best in it.
NEUT38|"But part of it is out of our certainly out of our control."""
