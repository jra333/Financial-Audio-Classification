NEUT0|"""Let's bring in Mohammed El Erian Ali, aunts, chief economic adviser Mohamed."
NEUT1|Great, to see.
NEUT2|Thanks for joining us before we get into the questions.
NEUT3|I should also mention, by the way, that the SP 500 didn't quite finish at an all time, closing high after things settled moments after the close, just a point or so below.
NEUT4|Contrary to what we were saying moments earlier Mohamed.
BULL5|Good to see you or of those risks to the market.
NEUT6|You in agreement with the order of them, which is your biggest threat to equity market levels at the moment?
NEUT7|So my biggest fact would be some combination of higher yield and a market accident.
BULL8|It is really impressive how well the stock market has done in the first quarter.
BEAR9|Given higher yield, all sorts of rotations within the market between stocks and bonds 3 near accidents.
NEUT10|What's been happening in Europe.
NEUT11|So this is a very resilient market, but I will keep an eye on yields and pockets of excessive risk taking Muhammad.
NEUT12|I wanted to ask you about the archegos issues that we've seen over the last week or so, and I wondered whether you thought there was risks of other overly leveraged long positions in the market, which might be kind of flattering.
NEUT13|The levels that we've seen in not necessarily there are more blocks to come, but just to highlight how stretched things could be, perhaps to the upside.
NEUT14|That could be, you know, I came on Monday morning and said while this is a typical case of massive leverage over concentration derivative overlays, it will be contained.
NEUT15|However, there's a bigger message coming out.
NEUT16|So in terms of are you worried about the stock market?
NEUT17|Today?
NEUT18|The answer is no, but the underlying forces are tool ever.
NEUT19|Leverage is so cheap and so abundant that yes, there probably are other pockets of excessive risk taking and the question becomes, do they explode at the same time?
BULL20|So far we've been able to handle these three near accidents, which is a good thing.
NEUT21|So it sounds like.
NEUT22|You're not too worried about it.
NEUT23|Overall it could happen, but.
NEUT24|I mean the fact the feds not take away the punch bowl anytime soon.
NEUT25|The Fed is not going to take the punch bowl anytime soon.
BULL26|I agree Sarah, but Banks may start being a little bit more cautious about the sorts of credit line they've been extending.
BEAR27|You know, there's a lot of embarrassment right now in certain banks.
NEUT28|How could we have allowed this family office to do what it did?
NEUT29|And how could we have been the last one out and not even getting out?
BEAR30|Just sitting on massive billions dollars of losses?
NEUT31|So a lot of I suspect there's a lot of banks looking very carefully right now at what else have they extended in terms of margin loans?
NEUT32|So what may happen is not the Fed takes away the punch bowl.
BULL33|Is that the system itself becomes somewhat more disciplined.
NEUT34|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT35|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
