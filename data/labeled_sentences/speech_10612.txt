BEAR2|I need emphasize again that the big risk from the coronavirus outbreak has to do with interrupted supply chains and a concomitant business slowdown.
BEAR3|Worldwide Chinese government post largest quarantine in human history on its own people.
NEUT4|And it turns out that American businesses we now learned are far too dependent on Chinese manufacturing for some really essential stuff.
NEUT5|By the way, I'm very worried about Pharmaceuticals.
NEUT6|I mean, they make the majority, or at least the ingredients.

BEAR21|Travel leisure is still going to be under enormous pressure.
BEAR22|Today was really day one of the accentuated weakness in Carnival Royal Caribbean in Norwegian cruise Lines.
BEAR23|For those cruise stocks able to stay so high last week it to the tragic Corona outbreak on Carnivals Diamond Princess, which turns out to be of course really maybe the worst thing that's happened in this whole epidemic.
NEUT24|I'll say it again, you don't want to be stuck on a cruise ship in the middle of a pandemic.
BEAR25|The numbers have to come down.
