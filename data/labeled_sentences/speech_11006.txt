BEAR2|An IO is currently down to 4.9% as of premarket shares.
BEAR3|This is due to an IO sell off to raise capital to beat their competition.

NEUT8|Nothing will slow this electric vehicle stock.
NEUT9|It has too many factors that will guarantee it to succeed.
BULL10|Anio is still flying higher on exceptional demand and delivery numbers, expecting more record breaking deliveries.
BULL11|I believe NIO will turn around soon after the sell off and easily hit $57.
BEAR12|The latest dip in Nio's stock price is a buying opportunity as things are destined to change for the better with solid monthly growth and earnings and higher demand for electric vehicles.
BULL13|NIO stock will be one of the top EV makers going forward.
NEUT14|Here are three reasons you should buy an eye on every price dip.
BEAR15|One delivery numbers since October and iOS deliveries were 5000 plus doubling year over year for the eighth consecutive month.
BULL16|Deliveries were up just over 100% year over year that month and in September they were up 133% year over year.
NEUT17|The way that NIO is going similar growth or more is expected in January 2 the electric vehicle boom is here.
BULL18|Let's be honest, EV sales will definetly improve under a Biden administration pushing for a greener future.
NEUT19|Major automakers are switching their fleets to electric General Motors.

BULL27|He also increased his price target to $40 a share lie, believing that Nio's market share will quadruple over the next five years.
BULL28|Moreover, Anio continues to produce stellar earnings, an iOS revenue of $666.6 million beat estimates on Wall Street by a large margin.

BULL30|NIO is fundamentally healthy with strong growth potential for the future conclusion.
