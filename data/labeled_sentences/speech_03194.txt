NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is the 22nd of December 2020, Tuesday, the 2nd day of the week.
BEAR2|We're at #27 Filecoin, Reticker fill, so Falcon games BC we dropped lower and lower.
BEAR3|We continue dropping lower and lower.
BEAR4|Your things are just not looking good for Filecoin.
NEUT5|We're quite over salt if you look at the RSI or super result.
NEUT6|The reason why is because for fine, really reason quite a lot, right?
NEUT7|If you look at fault line against BTC reason quite a lot.
BEAR8|Anyway, we're pretty broken.
BEAR9|Keep in mind so Bear Season has started for Filecoin against BTC, so it feels to me like, more likely than not, Filecoin should be dropping much lower, right?
BEAR10|We don't see any clear reversals for Filecoin, yet.
NEUT11|Feels to me like.
BEAR12|You know things are just not looking good for coins.
NEUT13|BTC he's like a support line here that has already been broken at a skinny pink line has already been broken back down, so there could be some respect coming soon, like a skinny pink line starts coming down.
BULL14|There could be a rally back up to a skinny pink line before we continue lower, right?
BEAR15|Potentially we could continue lower so bear trend has really started for Filecoin Falcon St in a bear trend against PC.
BEAR16|So if you see me like it's going to be more moves towards the downside, there could be a rally.
BEAR17|The balance coming on, but I think more likely than not we should be going lower for Filecoin, right?
NEUT18|So you need to switch your bias bearish for balcaen Filecoin, right?
BULL19|Let's move on to fight against USD T by before that.
NEUT20|Please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT21|Subscribe to our channel and let me know what you think about finding documents below for fight against USD T. Yeah, we were watching Filecoin very closely right, so we thought that our fall coin could form a symmetrical triangle, right?
NEUT22|So we could be going higher, but no.
NEUT23|No, no, no.
NEUT24|What happened was we broke down.
NEUT25|This was a descending triangle.
BEAR26|We completed a descending triangle and we dropped lower.
BEAR27|So things are just not looking good for Filecoin.
BEAR28|At this point of time there could be a rally coming on, but I think more likely than not it will continue lower ******* fall coin.
BEAR29|More likely than not should be continuing lower.
NEUT30|It's just not looking good at this point of time.
BEAR31|So yeah, things are just not looking good for Filecoin against BTC and not against USD.
NEUT32|Both are not looking good if you look at file coin.
BEAR33|On Coinmarketcap against USD.
BEAR34|Yeah it's really not looking good.
NEUT35|We could be forming mountain ranges here right now.
NEUT36|We could be making preparations to drop lower for Filecoin so be very very very careful about going to a trade too soon right?
NEUT37|If Bitcoin starts correcting, Filecoin very likely is going to start correcting as well, right?
NEUT38|This is a very nice accumulation at it came in for fall quite we plus out of it and right now yeah, we're deep in correction so you need to be very very careful.
NEUT39|Going to try to listen.
NEUT40|Look at the volume bars over here.
NEUT41|This could be whales selling off their stash, right?
NEUT42|So this would be the stash data we have accumulated and you're selling it off over here, so you need to be very careful about going to trade too soon.
NEUT43|Alright, yeah, be careful.
NEUT44|I guess that's it for my file content analysis.
BULL45|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL46|I hope you enjoyed it as well.
