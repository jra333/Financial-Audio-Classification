BEAR0|"""The Motley Fool Singapore, an investment advisory business that covers stocks and companies, will cease operations by the end of the month and offer subscribers are full refund now."
BEAR1|The company has cited regulations from the Monetary Authority of Singapore as the reason for its closure.
NEUT2|According to Ms, The Motley Fool, Singapore is classified as a financial institution under the Financial Advisors Act.
NEUT3|As such, it is required to maintain a paid up capital of $150,000 and net assets, equivalent to three months expenses.
BEAR4|But the company believes that the rules have hindered its growth.
NEUT5|The bigger we become, the more money we have to set aside in order to satisfy this thing, called the asset value, and we understand that unless the rules are changed, we would actually sort of one day become so big that we will have to continually inject capital into the business.
NEUT6|The company will start producing content by the end of the month and is also in the process of refunding around 10,000 of its paid subscribers who pay between 200 and $2000 annually.
NEUT7|That money has already been set aside, so therefore we made sure that we had the repayment process or the refund process in place at the same time as the announcement.
NEUT8|So we announced it today and the money is already going out to people's accounts.
NEUT9|Masd says Motley Fool.
BEAR10|Singapore has assured that there will be an orderly, winding down of its business.
NEUT11|"The company will also provide sufficient notice to its clients, business partners and other relevant stakeholders regarding its cessation."""
