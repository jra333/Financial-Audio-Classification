NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to the grow and Invest Channel and in today's video we'll have a look at the company desktop metal."
NEUT1|The stock is trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DM.
NEUT2|Now the first thing I want to clear out is that I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT3|These are just my thoughts and findings of stock.
NEUT4|The information in this video is only intended for education purposes.
NEUT5|Investing can be risk full, so remember to do always your own research or go to a financial advisor.
NEUT6|Now desktop Metal is a 3D printing company that uses the technology of additive manufacturing.
NEUT7|Now, 3D printing and additive manufacturing or very similar but 3D printing is more focused on using plastic materials and are less precise, additive manufacturing and especially additive manufacturing 2.0.
NEUT8|So am 2.0 can make parts out of metals and alloys and with a high precision.
NEUT9|Desktop Metal was founded in 2015 with the goal of producing parts and components out of metal.
NEUT10|Using this AM 2.0 technology.
NEUT11|Since then, they have raised $450 million from venture investors like Google Venture, BMW, GE Ventures and many more.
NEUT12|So these are really big names.
NEUT13|Desktop metal has four products.
NEUT14|The studio system was the first to launch the fiber system and the shop system are also available now and the production system is planned for the second half of 2021 and the last one I think is also the most exciting one.
NEUT15|I have lots of trust that is technology also will be applied on a big scale.
BULL16|Expectations are that this market will grow from 12 billion last year, 246 billion in 2030.
NEUT17|If you look at all possible applications of the additive manufacturing 2.0, it can be applied from core industries to space Industries to robotics and many more so you won't be surprised that this is true growth stock.
NEUT18|Also some news came out on the 15th of January.
NEUT19|Desktop metal bought envisiontec for $300 million.
NEUT20|They're doing photo polymer additive manufacturing.
NEUT21|They are specialized and market leader in the dental market, but lots of other markets are part of their business as well.
BULL22|They have almost 5000 customers in total and with their huge distribution network desktop metal will be in a better position than before.
NEUT23|Since Envisiontec has been bought.
NEUT24|Arc Invest started a position in desktop metal.
NEUT25|As well, since that time they have bought more and more and at this time desktop metal is in the fourth position of the Ark Invest 3D Printing ETF.
NEUT26|I also wouldn't be surprised if they keep adding shares in the future with all those points put together.
BULL27|I think this company has a big future ahead.
NEUT28|We're talking about a technology that probably will change the way of manufacturing.
NEUT29|This will take years to grow, but I think it's inevitable.
NEUT30|I started my position when it traded under the ticker symbol TRN.
NEUT31|E It was a speck at the time an I started the position at around $11.00.
NEUT32|At this point, desktop metal is trading around 31 to $32.
NEUT33|It might drop a little bit more, but if you are a long term investor like me, those fluctuations don't matter that much.
NEUT34|I think the story of desktop metal actually has just begun.
NEUT35|I have so much trust in his company an industry so I really will hold my position for years to come.
NEUT36|Now with that set I'll end up the video.
