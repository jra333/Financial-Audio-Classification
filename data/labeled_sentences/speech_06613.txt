NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and thank you for joining this technical analysis video here to extend.com."
NEUT1|It's Friday, September 18th and before we head into the weekend, let's have a look at what's happening in the pony and market following some Brexit tensions the past two weeks and some risk off in global markets.
BEAR2|So looking at the daily chart, price has been quite muted this week.
NEUT3|Squeeze between 135 point 55136, where the 38.2% if an edge of the March rally and the bottom of the McLeod are placed on Thursday.
BULL4|The former resistance trendline stretch from 147.94 provided enough support to push the price back near the Chaco Cloud.
NEUT5|But by looking at the momentum indicators, the bias is still largely bearish.
BEAR6|VR size seems unable to rebound towards its 50 neutral mark.
BEAR7|The Magdi continues to lose momentum below his ear and red signal lines.
BEAR8|While if we look at the chemical indicators, the written consent line keeps sloping downwards and below the blue canvas, and so the next move in the price could still be a negative one.
BULL9|And decisive close below 135.55 could see an extension towards the 50% fibo Nachi 133.35 if the trend line at 134.55.
BEAR10|Proofs easy to get through all over the area between the previous load 131.74 and the 61.8% Fibonacci 131.14 could be another important obstacle.
BEAR11|Since any violation at this point would have switched the medium term picture from bullish to neutral.
NEUT12|And the positive scenario.
BEAR13|Now if the price sustains an upside move above 136, I would look for resistance around the 23.6% bunch of 138.30 body ascending trend line that connects all the logs from the March bottom end.
BEAR14|The 20 day moving average are also within the zone so it could be a tough barrier to overcome.
BULL15|However, if the price manages to climb that wall for the price could hit next for the 139.8 restricted area and then towards 141.70.
NEUT16|So that's all for pounding in today.
BULL17|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
