NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well quite the eventful day on this one.
BULL6|Big impressive price movement.
BEAR7|I mean not that long ago at all the price was down around this area of the chart and now it's worked its way much further from there.
NEUT8|Some more of the story, a lot of updates that need to be done moving forward.
NEUT9|So much so that I'm just going to go ahead and delete these lines out.
NEUT10|Sure these levels still pertain to the chart, they're just not really relevant right now from the presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines everywhere.
NEUT11|Everywhere you look, so let's try to keep this analysis as clean as possible going forward.
NEUT12|Well, the newest areas of support, what I would call the ideal level moving forward me.
NEUT13|Frankly, you know what?
NEUT14|Make this chart look?
NEUT15|The absolute strongest?
NEUT16|Going forward.
NEUT17|That would be if the price could say up there above 3160.
BEAR18|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3160, that does not mean that the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL19|But yeah, if the price could manage step above that area, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT20|Taking a step back and look at all of this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT21|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT22|The 50.
NEUT23|Simple moving average.
NEUT24|Keyword being moving so as time goes by, that line is going to start to move itself higher and higher, which will be very helpful because when it comes to gauging the health of the move, that right there being defined as the move, just watch a purple line.
NEUT25|As long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control of visualize that.
NEUT26|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT27|Yes and about 3160 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the sharp as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT28|It's all about that pink line moving forward, which on my chart denotes.
NEUT29|Well known, the very famous 200.
NEUT30|Simple moving average.
NEUT31|Current value of that as well.
NEUT32|Just call it at 3205 so 3205 Public Enemy number one moving forward.
NEUT33|But on all any angle you look at it.
BULL34|Great volume today.
NEUT35|Great price movement.
BULL36|So let's see if the price can continue to build on this momentum.
BULL37|Moving forward First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT38|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL40|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT42|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR43|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT44|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT45|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT46|And I'll show you how it all works.
