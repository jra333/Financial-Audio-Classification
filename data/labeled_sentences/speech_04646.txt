NEUT0|"""I'm mark review with Brendan T-bone Matthews in our stock of the days LinkedIn."
BEAR1|Shares of the company or down today after announced earnings.
BEAR2|Brendan, what were some of the numbers that call your eye so it was actually a good quarter revenue, was up 47% and their Talent Solutions group, which is basically their service for corporate recruiting, lead the way it was up over 50% but the market is a future looking mechanism and what they did is they issued guidance for next year that was sort of lower than the market expected.
BEAR3|They're only going to grow about 33% next year, so good quarter but bad guidance.
NEUT4|Interesting, now that's for LinkedIn.
BULL5|It's a high growth tech stock.
NEUT6|What's that sort of guidance going to their valuation?
NEUT7|Well, so that's the thing.
NEUT8|I love LinkedIn.
BULL9|I think it's a great business.
NEUT10|It's a super powerful platform, but it is an expensive stock.
NEUT11|It's at over 100 times forward earnings.
NEUT12|It's at a high teens multiple of sales.
NEUT13|So what that means is the market is expecting a lot in the future.
BEAR14|To justify its current price and when you have management coming out saying our growth is going to slow a little bit, that's definitely going to hurt the stock price.
NEUT15|OK, but let me let me put it in a little bit of perspective.
NEUT16|Think about Twitter, which has a higher market cap.
NEUT17|Then LinkedIn earns less, has less in sales, but it's a more expensive stock.
NEUT18|Billington I think of all the social media platforms.
NEUT19|LinkedIn is really my favorite.
NEUT20|OK, so all that being said, with the expectations a little lower is today a buying opportunity, so I think.
BULL21|LinkedIn is a great stock for investors to have as part of a diversified portfolio of growth stocks.
BULL22|It has a huge market opportunity over 200,000,000 members.
NEUT23|It's very sticky service.
BEAR24|The thing is that pesky valuation.
NEUT25|So what I would do is maintain it as part of a diversified portfolio growth stocks and hopefully the big winners will offset any losers and try to buy strategically.
BEAR26|Today might be a good day to buy because the stock is down alright for T-bone Matthews.
NEUT27|I'm Mark wreath, that's our stock of the day.
NEUT28|"Will see you next week."""
