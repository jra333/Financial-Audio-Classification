BULL0|"""Hi everybody, markable outta here with Brendan from Pythagoras."
NEUT1|Investing so Brennan tell us what you do for people's investments only thank you very much Mark.
NEUT2|So I figure it's investing.
NEUT3|We demystify the stock market for our customers.
NEUT4|We provide them with mathematically precise by Anselm notifications and what's important about that is that we provide them with the buy signals with a price and timing, and most of all, a cell signal of timing so they know when to enter and exit the market.
BULL5|Wow, that's incredible.
NEUT6|And what are some of the biggest I guess problems or challenges that you see people you know doing when they you know, invest?
NEUT7|One of the largest problems is reacting to information in the stock market.
NEUT8|No one can actually consume that amount of information that they have to analyze in the stock market, so they're reacting to an event all the time.
NEUT9|Where Pythagoras, we're always encouraging our customers to proactively invest before an event happens, right?
NEUT10|Tell me about the emotions, how the emotions can affect people's choices in buying.
NEUT11|So what are the emotions and what can happen?
NEUT12|The biggest problem with people investing is their emotions.
NEUT13|Take control of them.
NEUT14|And they are aware of that too.
NEUT15|So the fear in Greek and really come into it.
NEUT16|So what we're doing through the mathematics is just removing all the emotion from their decisions.
NEUT17|What we're doing is giving them the buy signal with a process and timing.
NEUT18|So then they don't have to analyze it then as well as the important cell signal.
NEUT19|So then they can get out of the market then too.
NEUT20|So I don't have to be hesitant, hesitant of whether or not that they're making the right decision.
NEUT21|It's mathematically calculated, so this saves some time.
NEUT22|Give him Peace of Mind, makes the money, is that what we're saying here?
NEUT23|Place in their life?
NEUT24|Right, they get their life back, you know, let's let's face it, they don't have to do the hours and hours of burden of stock market research.
NEUT25|Yeah, it's just been done for 130,000 lines of code analyzing their stocks every day to two or three minutes of trading a day for them.
NEUT26|So what are a couple of tips that you would recommend?
NEUT27|If somebody who's listening was going to get into investment, and I know probably the first step would be to contact you, but outside of that you know what would be.
NEUT28|What would be your top 2 tips for new investors or even existing investors who are struggling?
NEUT29|To to to get the results that they're looking for.
NEUT30|Yeah, absolutely.
NEUT31|Look in regards to investing in.
NEUT32|Everyone understands that the stock market is a great place to make cool and high returns on.
NEUT33|And knowing that you actually donated a large amount of capital to invest either in the stock market, yeah, so there's a couple of really key things there, and you know when I ask something to invest, understanding how they're investing too.
NEUT34|So we just spoke about, you know, the proactive first reactive trading is really, really big one, and that causes people ball burner really be calling their walls because of that.
NEUT35|And that's what we're providing a solution to.
