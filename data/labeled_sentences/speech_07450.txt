BULL0|"""No, but it is a lot better than what we saw for the last half of of 2018, so I think this is indicative of the fact that Germany is not as weak as it appeared to be."
NEUT1|An there is mainly driven system message him and some life in the altar.
BULL2|In the beast there are very strong competing views on the fortunes for eurozone economies coming into the second half of the year.
NEUT3|Some that see a re acceleration.
NEUT4|As a trade resolution happens and that Europe actually escaped, the worst of that others much more downbeat, as you will know, the Bears are out there growling.
NEUT5|Where do you sit in that there's somewhere between the two?
BULL6|We see growth this year, year at 1% for the Euro area, which is not great.
BEAR7|It's below potential, so there will be.
BULL8|Upward pressure on unemployment but is at the same time, though far from being a recession, the hope that we will get a trade resolution in the second half of this year is, however, I think an Idol one.
NEUT9|I want to get into the trade issue a little bit more because I'm just looking at the first quarter numbers from Germany and if you look at the export figure that was plus 1% on quarter imports plus point 7%, not exactly runaway figures to the upside if trade does get solved, what should these numbers look like in this type of economic cycle?
NEUT10|Well, if you get a further intensification of the trade conflict between China and the US, and if after November.
NEUT11|The US starts playing bull hardball with Europe over of a car import.
BEAR12|I think we could see these export data actually deteriorate.
NEUT13|Again, the extra data weren't great for Germany, but they are not recession data.
NEUT14|So that is the good news.
BEAR15|The furious that have trade wars intensify.
NEUT16|Why are you so pessimistic?
NEUT17|But there will be a resolution on the trade story.
NEUT18|Becaused at least on the US versus China side.
BEAR19|This trade conflict is part of a much wider economic conflict, including everything from intellectual property to FDI.
NEUT20|To request that any straighter economic model and then by the economic conflict is intern, embedded in a geopolitical conflict between the rising Hagemann China and established.
NEUT21|I want for this conflict even if this particular trade issue get settled.
NEUT22|Will come to visit us because this is the new Cold War.
