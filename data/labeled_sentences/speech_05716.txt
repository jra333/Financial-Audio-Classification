BULL0|"""Alright greetings, good evening people."
NEUT1|You know you know it's getting serious when I'm busting out the microphone, right?
NEUT2|Haven't seen this thing for a long time, so catalyst for selling Facebook shares.
NEUT3|As some of you know, Facebook was my favorite company.
NEUT4|I was invested in.
NEUT5|Doesn't matter when I bought in, but it was my favorite company.
NEUT6|Was awesome, just like I just could do no wrong for so long and it's over now.
NEUT7|So this is a social arbitrage play, right?
BEAR8|I got a lot of followers who are just not happy with it.
BEAR9|They're telling me they're getting off Facebook that they're just telling me they **** that they're done that they don't like it anymore.
NEUT10|You've Facebook is personally shadow banned my account.
NEUT11|If you go in the search and type in waking up from my account doesn't even show up yet.
NEUT12|Back in the summer when I'm playing guitar and networking with people, I go hey, you know, follow me on Instagram.
NEUT13|It's a waking up, it comes right up with wake with waking.
NEUT14|Right up look.
NEUT15|You personally shadow banned my account right?
NEUT16|I'm not going to stay invested in a company that's completely screwed over my livelihood.
NEUT17|You really?
BEAR18|You've really jammy in the ***.
NEUT19|Hard but this 10 AM I allowed to say asan mylott say ***** that go against the policy?
NEUT20|I don't even know what I can and can't say anymore at this point yet.
NEUT21|Another reason to not be invested in Facebook right?
NEUT22|'cause things aren't clear, right?
NEUT23|Perfect, yes, sketchy policy's I mean the stocks ran from 1:40, you know, to two 7300, and you know, I get that the intrinsic value of the company's 300, but there are still some serious risk of, you know, company being broken up by the government or whoever the **** is, the government is right.
NEUT24|Who knows what's going on is that against the policy to write it can I?
NEUT25|Can I say that?
NEUT26|Can I say I don't even know what I can't say anymore?
BULL27|And yeah, I just feel like there's better.
NEUT28|There's better invest investments out there.
BEAR29|He got FedEx making fresh lows, which earned more per share than Facebook and stock prices lower than Facebook.
BULL30|He got Lockheed Martin making fresh lows and dare I say, you could probably you could probably buy Bitcoin, and Bitcoin will probably be a better investment than Facebook.
NEUT31|So there you go.
NEUT32|There's the catalyst to sell your Facebook shares.
NEUT33|And yeah, I'll be telling you know, a lot of folks you know in my in my circle here who are also Facebook shareholders.
NEUT34|I will be telling them to dump their shares an on any spikes up to actually consider shorting the stock.
BULL35|So thank you, Ann.
NEUT36|That is my catalyst for selling your Facebook investment.
NEUT37|Thank you people and and by the way, Facebook.
BEAR38|I'm sorry if anything I said in this video goes against.
NEUT39|Your you, your new policy's?
NEUT40|'cause?
NEUT41|I'm sorry you didn't really make it clear.
BULL42|"Thanks, Facebook."""
