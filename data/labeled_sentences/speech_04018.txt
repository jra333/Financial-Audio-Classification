BULL0|"""Alright, and we're back with some chart action and I'm looking at who yo right now and I wanted to show you guys something that I was kind of saw so."
NEUT1|There's this pattern right here that I thought it was.
BEAR2|Anyways, like this triangle pattern, but we're still having declining volume.
NEUT3|There's no break out really, and if you go into the bigger time frame, let me just show you kind of the bigger picture.
BEAR4|We're kind of running into this resistance right here.
BULL5|We topped out right here and right here, and that draws that trendline, and it looks like we're coming up on it.
BEAR6|So this is the weekly right now, and it looks like we kind of got rejected.
NEUT7|We came up close and then we were coming back down now.
NEUT8|But so, and this is this just happened.
NEUT9|So let's see what I'm thinking is.
NEUT10|Let's see if we can break above this pattern and then I'll start.
BEAR11|Getting bullish on it, but the other thing is like I was saying, there's the volume declining, so that made me check out the RSI.
BEAR12|And if you look at the relative strength index, it looks like there is a bearish divergance on the one hour timeframe.
NEUT13|Let me see what the four hour.
NEUT14|I didn't check the four hour.
BEAR15|Yeah, the four hour has it too, so that's trending down.
NEUT16|And then this is trending up.
NEUT17|Slightly well, yeah it is.
BULL18|It's trending up that was.
NEUT19|So yeah.
NEUT20|Bearish divergance in the four hour in the one hour.
NEUT21|But if you're going to the daily, it's pretty much.
NEUT22|Oh yeah, no, that's there too.
NEUT23|I didn't think so either.
NEUT24|Either this is going to get rejected.
NEUT25|Or it's going to when it breaks this it's going to.
BEAR26|It's going to pop pretty good, but it but it'll end up in like oversold territory, so I don't know like how how long it will be able to keep it up, but it might go on a on a run.
NEUT27|Let's see what it does, maybe Monday or the rest of today.
NEUT28|But probably next week will see.
BULL29|I would say if it comes up above this line then we can get bullish.
NEUT30|And if it kind of gets rejected and it stays down here, we might want to.
BEAR31|It might get a bigger move down because of the divergance.
NEUT32|So yeah, just wanted to kind of let you guys know I was just looking at charts and saw this one.
NEUT33|Let me know what you guys think of who you've put some comments about the fundamentals and stuff down below.
