NEUT0|"""Ladies and gentlemen, it's your boy, Ryan Dingshan."
NEUT1|On today's episode we're going to talk about energy transfer.
NEUT2|ET is the ticker symbol, so it's time to phone home.
NEUT3|We're going to do an in depth dividend stock analysis.
NEUT4|Should I buy energy transfer right now?
NEUT5|Yes or no.
NEUT6|So let's go.
NEUT7|Energy Transfer is a oil company also known for the Dakota Pipeline very controversial?
BEAR8|Basically, they are able to accumulate oil through fracking as well as other traditional methods, and there's a lot of controversy behind them because the Native American communities in North Dakota and South Dakota are not thrilled with people drilling on their lands.
BEAR9|Including the water government has a lot of power, so they've been trying to fight it, but it's not working now.
NEUT10|However, there is one issue that may be a problem with this and that is Joe Biden being the next president because Trump was very pro Economy Pro.
NEUT11|Let's get money.
NEUT12|Let's help these corporations.
NEUT13|I don't really care about the rivers and that kind of thing.
NEUT14|Fighting once cleaner energy, so there may be some government regulations.
BULL15|However, at this price right now I find it to be a very good deal.
BULL16|It has a PE ratio, a 12 month trailing PE ratio of about 10% which is very good as we all know Apple.
NEUT17|Microsoft companies like that are in the 30s.
NEUT18|It seems like a very good deal at this moment is in the low 80s.
BULL19|Right now I get a price target around 12 to 14 in a year from now, so I think it's going to get a 50% gain in the next year.
BULL20|Also, the dividends really good.
BEAR21|They recently cut the dividend this summer.
NEUT22|It was crazy, was over 10%, but now it's seven and a half which is more reasonable.
BEAR23|I don't really blame them for cutting the dividend.
NEUT24|The dividend at one point was like 13%.
NEUT25|It's kind of crazy, so they cut the dividend and the price kind of plummeted because of that and ended up in the sixes, in which case I bought more when it was in six is now it's around 8:00.
BULL26|It's not as great of a deal, but it's definitely still a good deal, especially with that dividend.
NEUT27|So yeah, you need to do your own research and look into this because there are some government issues that are going to make or break this stock in the next year.
NEUT28|However, any sort of regulation that the government might do under the Biden administration, I feel like it won't actually affect.
NEUT29|The stock for awhile because let's say that they banned fracking and they ban the pipelines.
NEUT30|It's going to take a few years, not like it's going to be done overnight.
NEUT31|I plan on holding this for awhile and if I see it get around the 12 even 13 range I'm willing to sell like a little bit of it because it's always good to take profit where it's at.
BULL32|Right now I feel like it's one of the most undervalued stocks there is, specially with a great dividend.
NEUT33|If you look at my entire portfolio, about 22 positions and I believe this is the second highest dividend out of any stock I have.
NEUT34|With that being said, don't go chasing yield.
NEUT35|Don't buy a stock just because you think it has a high dividend, because sometimes it has a high dividend because the stocks garbage and they need to attract investors through dividends.
NEUT36|You don't want to.
NEUT37|For companies like that.
BEAR38|This company I think it's been unfairly beaten down by bad press just was really affected by covid more than most stocks.
NEUT39|It really took a plummeting.
