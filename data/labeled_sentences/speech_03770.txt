BEAR0|"""Currency traders are treating the Mexican peso like a pinata."
BEAR1|Emerging markets risks go up, it gets whacked, oil prices go down, it gets whacked.
BEAR2|Polls show that Britain might vote to leave the European Union wack, Wack, Wack again.
BEAR3|The result is that the peso is one of the most enduringly undervalued currencies, and this year it's the worst performing currency in the world against the US dollar.
BEAR4|The trouble is that the Mexican peso is by far the most liquid of the emerging markets currencies.
NEUT5|It trades about $135 billion a day, 24 hours a day and that makes it an ideal vehicle for hedging all kinds of risks every time there's something new to worry about.
BEAR6|Additional traders are light on the peso as a short meaning it never fully recovers from the last scare.
BULL7|Most recently it started to move in line with Sterling as traders use it as a Brexit hedge.
NEUT8|Even though you'd be hard pressed to discern an economic impact on Mexico from Britain.
NEUT9|Opting out of a European free trade area.
BEAR10|Low oil prices genuinely have been bad for Mexico.
BEAR11|They've gutted the finances of the state oil company Pemex and the government has had to cut spending this year as a result.
BEAR12|That in turn has hit economic growth.
BULL13|But at $50 a barrel, the higher oil price should be alleviating some of that pressure.
NEUT14|Instead, peso bears are now pointing to the wall building.
NEUT15|President Donald Trump as the next risk to worry about.
NEUT16|But whether Mr. Trump actually gets to turn his rhetoric into action is pretty uncertain.
BULL17|Because the pesos declined can't be explained by the fundamentals, the Bank of Mexico's already once intervened to push it higher.
BEAR18|It did an emergency interest rate rise in February when the currency fell to 19 to the US dollar.
NEUT19|Now we're not far away from that low again now, and that will surely be on the minds of officials at the Central banks meeting next Thursday.
BULL20|By then we'll know if Britain is leaving the EU if the vote goes to remain, that ought to relieve the pressure on the peso, but don't count on it.
NEUT21|There always seems to be some.
NEUT22|"Other reason to give the pinata a wack."""
