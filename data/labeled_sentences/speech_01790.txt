NEUT0|"""It's basically there's a couple main differences between buying an index fund or buying mutual funds."
BULL1|In my opinion, the index funds or going to be better option and be better for investors over the long term.
NEUT2|A couple different reasons.
NEUT3|You know we buy an index fund.
NEUT4|We're not dealing with management in possibility of that management turning over you leaving for whatever reason.
NEUT5|Getting a new job, opening up their own hedge fund if they're doing really well or something like that.
NEUT6|And you know a change at the top which could dramatically change the impact of how that mutual fund performs.
NEUT7|Another reason is you know the expense ratio.
NEUT8|What's the expenses on a mutual fund opposed to just your basic index fund?
NEUT9|And if we look at we look at this chart real quick, I can show that to you.
NEUT10|Basically the expense ratio on the Spider SP500 index fund is .09%.
NEUT11|We compare that out with Vanguard at .31%, the PIMCO at .55% or even the Goldman Sachs large growth cap at 1.71%.
NEUT12|That's a major difference here.
NEUT13|We're talking.
BULL14|Goldman Sachs is 19 times higher, or 19 times more expensive than just the S&P 500 index fund.
NEUT15|And that's going to be a big big part of your long term returns.
NEUT16|Taking that that cost into effect here.
NEUT17|So that's one other reason.
NEUT18|I also, if we look at the chart we got dividend the dividend, yield their dividend yield on the S&P 500 index is 1.95%, and if you run that across there you can see the next best one is the PIMCO one at 1.27, and even that Goldman Sachs, the cost most costly index fund I have up on here is only a pain .39%, so again, you know these products in these mutual funds are costing you more money and on a dividend basis.
BEAR19|They're paying you less per year.
NEUT20|And last thing, obviously you can see there is their performance over one month, three year, one year, three and five in.
NEUT21|While some of these mutual funds have outperformed the S&P 500 index over, you know smaller periods of time and everything, there's not a single one of them that's performed that's outperformed the SP over the five year or even over some of the other periods.
NEUT22|And that's one of the major things we need to look at here is, you know any of these guys.
NEUT23|Any of these mutual funds might outperform over one year, but they're slightly just barely doing it.
NEUT24|But over a long period of time, it's very difficult to totally blow the market out of the water.
NEUT25|And even if they are doing that, or you know, beating the market by a little bit, we have to account in for the dividend yield and those expenses and how that's going to change the overall return on your portfolio.
NEUT26|And just to wrap this up, you know I'm not saying that there's no mutual funds or you're not going to find any mutual fund out there that has outperformed the S&P 500 index over a period of one 510.
NEUT27|Whatever it is, 15 years, or that doesn't pay a higher dividend, or you know, isn't very close in the.
NEUT28|Expenses and costs but.
NEUT29|As a whole, you know the mutual fund Market Mutual Fund arena is just littered with with market with products that have underperformed the S&P 500 so basis and without spending a ton of time and everything.
NEUT30|"It's just smarter and just easier for the average investor that doesn't want to dig through different stocks and dig through different company filings just to buy the S&P 500 index, sit back, relax and not really have to worry about things."""
