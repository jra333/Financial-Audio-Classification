BULL0|"""Welcome back and thank you for watching."
NEUT1|This is another stock analysis video with an LC capital.
NEUT2|In this video we're going to be looking at Texas Roadhouse ticker symbol TXRH.
NEUT3|Let me see again TXRH.
BULL4|And they're reporting earnings tomorrow, which is 8 one 2016 and we think they're going to have a great quarter.
NEUT5|The chart looks like they are going to have a great quarter, so let's dive into that chart and discuss it.
NEUT6|You can first notice this beautiful uptrend, OK?
NEUT7|You can see the multiple tests of this support level.
NEUT8|You know.
NEUT9|Let me draw this a little bit better so you can see this option as beautiful as it is.
NEUT10|You can see this just absolute beauty starts in a nice deep consolidation period.
BULL11|It's a nice consolidation period.
NEUT12|Look at this.
NEUT13|An we broke out of that and now we're treating up in this 45 degree ultra absolute technical and beautiful.
NEUT14|We are actually in a little bit of a channel from draw that you can see this little this.
NEUT15|It's not a perfect channel but it's you know doing it for now.
NEUT16|But you can just see this multiple tests and how the traders and bars keep coming in to buy it.
BULL17|You have this RSI that is trending upward in a very nice pattern as well.
BULL18|An Texas Roadhouse, the stock is also trading above the 50 day moving average, another bullish sign.
BEAR19|So this is the one hour chart you see is really massive drop off from the $49.00 level.
NEUT20|So this is going to be the near term resistance level.
NEUT21|Why draw this?
NEUT22|You can see if the price has had trouble getting above it.
NEUT23|This has been a major pivot point and it most likely will be until earnings are released and it will either go up or down after that announcement.
NEUT24|If it goes up, you'll see this.
NEUT25|You'll see price closed the gap and most likely trade above 49.
NEUT26|Obviously it's not too far away.
BULL27|Texas Roadhouse is looking to make a $3.60 move, which would easily clear it above that level, put it into the high 50 bomb $50.
NEUT28|An almost $51.00 as a as a price.
BULL29|Near term support you can see looking left, the previous resistance here is now support.
NEUT30|After breaking through that level and obviously the others.
NEUT31|Just this area is at $49.00 level.
BULL32|So if you do get good report, if you do get a good report out of Texas Roadhouse, you will see a trade above that level and close that gap.
NEUT33|If not, you can see it roll over an most likely trade to this $4046 level, most likely below 2 is expected.
NEUT34|Make that $3.60 move.
NEUT35|So this 40 years 44 hour level looks pretty reasonable for that move it is.
NEUT36|That is the next support level.
NEUT37|That far down.
