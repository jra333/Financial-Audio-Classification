BULL0|"""I mean the numbers came out last night on closing Bell and held up quite well until the earnings school."
BEAR1|So it was that that guidance on cap ex that spooked investors and led to the pull back.
NEUT2|I have to.
NEUT3|I have to think so.
NEUT4|From our perspective the investments great where we like profit.
NEUT5|We like investment for the future.
BEAR6|Amazons blew its balance sheet up in 2017 with $35 billion in more debt, which fueled what we're seeing in 2018.
BULL7|And what we will see in 2019, which is more sales growth.
BULL8|More growth at a WS in greater profitability, so there will be times during the Amazon lifecycle where it's going to invest and we've seen this since Amazon began.
NEUT9|They will take a pause.
NEUT10|Then they'll invest again an that makes the investment thesis kind of difficult, but for us as long term focus, this is.
NEUT11|This is just what company needs to do.
NEUT12|I mean, on both a WS and the advertising business, the growth rates year over year phenominal right?
BEAR13|But both did disappoint slightly versus analysts consensus.
NEUT14|I wonder what the consensus is based on.
NEUT15|We put we don't put public forecasts out for individual companies, but when we do them internally, we do them internally to kind of get a roll up for the entire sector an.
BEAR16|Amazon exceeded what we thought it would do in both Q4 an for the year, mostly from a profitability perspective, profitability was off the charts from where we were, and I think that's the that should be the focus going forward.
BULL17|We knew the holiday spending quarter was going to be strong, yes, which it was.
NEUT18|Is there fear that that could slow down significantly?
NEUT19|Whether it's the quarter ahead with the shutdown or the year ahead, generally with the economic outlook, perhaps not quite as rosy.
BEAR20|First quarter is always tough with Amazon, with any other retailer, because you're coming off the Holiday Inn.
NEUT21|And this was one of the stronger Holidays.
BEAR22|We've seen an awfully long time.
NEUT23|We're still waiting for, you know, Walmart and Best Buy.
BULL24|But we've got sales numbers from target that were really solid.
BULL25|We've got sales numbers from Costco that were really solid.
NEUT26|Amazon's numbers for the quarter were very solid, so let's see how it plays out.
NEUT27|How much of this is a retail story, and how much of this is a WS?
BULL28|Well, the profitability.
BULL29|Finally the retail profitability crossed a threshold from where we sit.
BULL30|We're looking at 5% margins on the retail side which is impressive.
BULL31|Walmart's margins are around the same.
NEUT32|Walmart sells a lot more food, so it's not really apples to apples, but.
BULL33|For Amazon, is a retailer again we thought this we thought the quarter in the year played out very well.
BEAR34|One of the things that we've been concerned about in the past is Amazon sacrificing profitability for sales growth.
NEUT35|That did not happen this year.
BULL36|There was a there was really good profitability on the retail side.
NEUT37|A WS is a WS I think, and I put a quote out last night that said, you know, it's almost like a broken record or a WS is going to grow almost geometrically.
BULL38|The margins are going to continue to expand and they're going to continue to gain market share and that drives a lot of.
NEUT39|Yeah, that puts a lot less emphasis on the retail business from where we sit.
BEAR40|"Still important, but awos can wash away a lot of stuff on the retail side."""
