NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to this technical analysis video for Wednesday, April 15th from Christina Barson investment analyst at exam.com."
NEUT1|Taking a look at the New Zealand versus the US dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|So looking at the chart, we had a positive session last week with the price extending its rebound from 11 year lows but the descending trendline drawn from all point 6754 and a 50% Fibonacci retracement of this decline have proved hard to break and therefore we see the pair losing ground today.
BEAR3|But their site is also heading lower and is ready to drop below its 50 neutral mark and the Stochastics are ready to exit the overbought area, both providing discouraging signals for the near term trading.
BEAR4|I know the nearest support to look at is the 38.2% Fibonacci, four point 5960 and unless we don't see a rebound around this area to meet the trendline again, the selling pressure may stretch towards or point 5850 and then to the 23.6%.
NEUT5|If an actual 4.50.
BEAR6|770 are lower, stronger obstacle.
NEUT7|Maybe also found somewhere between oh point 5665 and oh point.
NEUT8|56.
NEUT9|On the flip side.
BULL10|Now if we managed to rally above the trendline, and more importantly, close above four point, 6150 resistance could run up to the 61.8% Liberal, four point.
BEAR11|6260, while higher the area between her oh point 6325 and B had 200 day moving average currently at 4.63.
BEAR12|80 will be closely watched by medium term trend traders as any improvement about this region would clearly violate the downtrend of our point.
BULL13|6750 for turning the outlook back to neutral.
NEUT14|So that's all from me.
BULL15|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
