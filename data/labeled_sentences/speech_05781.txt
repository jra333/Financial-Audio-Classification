NEUT0|"""Hello, this money crafter and now I will tell you about a cryptocurrency that literally shocks everyone with its behavior and potential growth."
NEUT1|Why would Warren Buffett be shocked and how would he react?
NEUT2|Let's get this straight from the beginning.
NEUT3|And yes, I forgot to tell you right now to write in the comments.
NEUT4|How much you have invested in this cryptocurrency.
NEUT5|I would be very interested.
NEUT6|Ripple has recently released a white paper making its case for the XRP private Ledger as a bridge for central bank digital currencies.
NEUT7|It is unclear if Ripple is addressing central banks with its white paper as a way to put pressure on the ongoing legal battle with the SEC.
BEAR8|Either way, central banks may hesitate to work with Ripple at this particular time, more so if they lose the case and the firm becomes overwhelmed with private legal claims.
NEUT9|Too much uncertainty to deal with while competitors get in line for attention from central banks, including her three escorta, etherium and stellar hedera.
BULL10|Ripple, though has already got France's attention, and the European Central Bank is planning to launch the digital euro within the next five years.
NEUT11|Panetta has proposed a threshold of â‚¬3000.00 for every citizen.
NEUT12|What do you think about this right?
NEUT13|In the comments?
NEUT14|I'm really interested in everyone's opinion.
BULL15|XRP price has been moving higher as Ripple continues to operate and expand internationally.
NEUT16|The majority of its customers are outside of the US as well as the overall SRP traded volume.
BULL17|The price has also been carried along with the broader cryptocurrency rally, more than doubling from $0.22 at the start of the year to trade between 55 to $0.58 at the end of March.
BULL18|On March 29th, Ripple announced that it has agreed to acquire 40% of Mulation cross border payments firm Triangulo to meet growing demand in Southeast Asia.
BULL19|Triangular will support ripples, operations in countries such as the Philippines, while expanding the reach.
BULL20|This will create a large flow of new users in a country with a huge number of people making more and more payments over the Internet.
NEUT21|Warren Buffett recalled that there is a lot of Labor in Africa, and if Coca Cola was located in Africa, their volumes would be fantastic monopolistic.
BULL22|If we imagine that the crypto currency will be in Africa and received rapid growth outside the European Union, we get a great similarity with the marketing development of Bitcoin.
NEUT23|Therefore, for the investment genius Buffett, the early growth of this cryptocurrency will be a shock, but he still does not believe in crypto currencies, which I believe is absolutely in vain.
BULL24|It is reported that this cryptocurrency is actively traded and will receive more interest in December and January.
BULL25|The growth will go steadily to $1.00 this year, but since the court's decision may be positive, we can expect growth to reach 2 to $3.00.
NEUT26|Is it really possible to grow at such a pace?
NEUT27|You ask me.
NEUT28|I will confidently answer yes.
NEUT29|Each cryptocurrency receives support from the state and currency they are interested in, and Ripple is supported by the euro currency and the countries of the same great Africa.
NEUT30|This is just my personal opinion and a general analysis of the situation of the best cryptocurrency analysts.
