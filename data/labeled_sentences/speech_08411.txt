NEUT0|"""Explain this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|I'm not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Quite eventful day today, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume and good, solid, respectable well above average volume.
NEUT5|Some more of the story, a lot of eyeballs will be watching this one here, headed into Thursday.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of America.
BULL8|Play one make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that would be if the price could say up here above the 122 mark.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 122.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage step above that level.
BULL11|That would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|He must visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what has been represented in, yeah, absolutely stand above 122 would be fantastic.
NEUT21|But from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
BULL22|For this, we'll squeeze down the chart here a little bit.
NEUT23|To go back into the charts history a tad here and you can see that may next main level can be right up there around the one 2375 marks, so we've got somewhat near today, but one 2375 just coming from this kind of hassle area from a several days ago.
NEUT24|So keep a close eye on that, but All in all, anyway you look at it.
NEUT25|Great movement today, very nice volume and not just a question of can the price build upon this momentum moving forward, let's see what happens.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT28|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT31|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR32|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT33|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT34|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT35|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
