NEUT0|"""In this quick video on General Electric stock, so as we can see in front of us, this is one hour candle stick is showing the price movement and prices be moving inside the channel between 5.9 dollars and eight U.S. dollar."
NEUT1|The idea when prices are moving inside the China, we cannot say a lot.
NEUT2|We can just rely on tools like arisai or Stochastic is perhaps this one showing that the prices has been.
NEUT3|In over in.
NEUT4|Overboard for awhile.
BEAR5|But even if he goes in, oversold actually is not helping.
NEUT6|A loss is more for mine or mine for intraday investments.
NEUT7|If you want to see more for a couple weeks or months investment, it's not helping us as a tool so we can rely on is that the prices are close to the bottom support line and the idea is to go long only For these reasons.
NEUT8|An only based on technical analysis.
NEUT9|So in conclusion, because those prices.
NEUT10|I'm moving sideways and that close said to the bottom flatline residents support line.
NEUT11|Sorry, the idea is to go long, but before going long the process might keep going down, really reaching this $6 level before going up.
NEUT12|This is still an option, so if you want we can hold for a while before going long to see what's coming up in the next days and the prices may reach again.
NEUT13|This six U.S. dollar before going up after this target price of.
NEUT14|8 U.S. dollar.
BEAR15|Even the next days these support level will be broken, so it's it's gonna show is going to tell us that the market might keep going down and it will be a signal or weakness of this market.
NEUT16|But as we are right now for during last months this support level was broken only once, but for the last 1234 months and it has never been broken.
NEUT17|So I believe most likely we taking analysis.
NEUT18|There's nothing to believe because it's not always under percent sure.
BULL19|But most likely this this support will keep working as support and ideas to go long up to this target price of eight U.S. dollar.
NEUT20|So this is what those prices look like with my taking analysis interpretation without my taking analysis disease out those prices look like but it's easy to see that they're moving horizontaly or in a sideways condition or in a trendless condition.
NEUT21|So this is my understanding and interpretation.
NEUT22|This talk.
BULL23|Thanks for watching.
NEUT24|"This video by."""
