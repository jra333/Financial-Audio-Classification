NEUT0|"""There you can see it."
BEAR1|Facebook shares down almost 4% today so there there little mini winning streak was down.
NEUT2|Look at that in stock price 3176.
NEUT3|Do you think that that is a fair price for Facebook shares?
NEUT4|Mark hulbert.
NEUT5|Not says, not necessarily Mr Hulbert.
NEUT6|How are you today?
NEUT7|OK, how are you I'm doing?
BULL8|Well, I'm doing.
NEUT9|Let's talk about Facebook post about your column today.
NEUT10|Very interesting.
NEUT11|What is a better fair value for Facebook?
BEAR12|Shares is kind of a shocking number.
BEAR13|Well, yeah it is a shocking number.
NEUT14|Basically I use a number of, I think very reasonable assumptions about where the stock will be in five years time and then back out what it would need to be trading at today in order to give investors a good rate of return between now and five years.
NEUT15|And now I come up with the value of, believe it or not, $13.80 that is.
NEUT16|That's really not.
NEUT17|I think that's less than Yahoo.
NEUT18|Now.
NEUT19|What are the assumptions?
NEUT20|How does that work out?
NEUT21|'cause and why is it trading so high now?
NEUT22|Well, I mean you have to ask the people who were bidding up the price or paid $38.00 or even what I'm at first day went up to as high as 42.
NEUT23|Why they were paying that much?
NEUT24|A lot of people including myself, were saying there's no way the company could justify that high of a price, so I guess it's not for me to try to figure out why people would do that other than to say that you know, it's an extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds.
NEUT25|Nice, nice literary reference there, by the way, but OK, so why 1380?
NEUT26|How do you get the you talked about your assumptions, waters, little at the growth rates for the company that you're looking at?
BULL27|A key assumption is how fast will the revenue growth over the next five years.
NEUT28|It turns out there's a just released study by a number of academics, led by Jay Ritter, who's one of academia's leading experts on the IPO market.
NEUT29|He's at the University of Florida.
NEUT30|He looked at all IPOs between 1996 and 2010 in the US and looked at the average revenue growth rate over the first five years after they went to market.
BULL31|Turns out was a growth rate of 212%.
NEUT32|I apply that to Facebook and then look at Google's price to sales ratio on the assumption that.
BULL33|Facebook will be as valued in five years as Google is today.
NEUT34|That's an optimistic assumption.
NEUT35|Of course you can't.
NEUT36|Using those two assumptions of revenue growth and a price to sales ratio, you come up with with that price of it.
NEUT37|Turns out, in my column I calculated so at $23.00 in change or where the stock would need to be trading in five years time.
NEUT38|Well, no ones going to invest in Facebook today if it's going to be at 2380.
BULL39|In five years you back out an 11% growth rate, which is what the market has provided.
BEAR40|That's already too optimistic.
NEUT41|'cause I think it's so risky that you would need.
BULL42|Even higher than a market rate of return to justify.
NEUT43|But even at an 11% annualized return for five years, you'd need to be at 1380 to provide that kind of return and be at 23 and change in five years time.
NEUT44|So that's how I do the calculation.
NEUT45|It's amazing too.
NEUT46|I mean, you think Facebook actually waited to go public for a long time?
NEUT47|I think even 5, three years ago companies would go public earlier in their growth.
NEUT48|So a lot of faith, that sort of huge growth at startup growth.
BULL49|I think that's already been done well, that's right, and that's a very, very good.
BULL50|Point because even assuming that Facebook is going to be able to grow at the average rate is already optimistic for the very point you mentioned.
NEUT51|Another reason why I think it might be too optimistic is that percentage growth rates are much harder to maintain on a company that's already huge.
NEUT52|Obviously when it's a small company, revenue growth rate is relatively easy, but you know what?
NEUT53|Facebook is now the 48th largest company by market cap in the US.
NEUT54|It's already huge.
BEAR55|"It's going to be hard to maintain a very fast growth rate."""
