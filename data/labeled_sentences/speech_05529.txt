BEAR0|"""Hi guys, since I mispelt on yesterday's video I decided to make a quick video talking about Peloton today and basically yesterday, Goldman Sachs analysts downgraded pellet on to hold a belief and citing a short term headwinds and price price of the stock went up too much too fast and actually Goldman Sachs."
NEUT1|You look at the school is a bullish long term, but very short term and it's only bearish because of the price appreciation this year since it said it too.
BULL2|It's by a list when it was like $60.00 peloton went up like 150%.
NEUT3|So it's very natural for right now.
BULL4|And kudos to Goldman.
NEUT5|And it's very natural for going to come out and say that the price.
NEUT6|Appreciate it too much and maybe.
BEAR7|It may come down a little bit to plus there are problems in Los Angeles ports right now with loading, unloading post on products so it could be some headwinds going to into the next quarter.
NEUT8|4 Palatine.
BEAR9|So in general I agree with Golden Call and actually bullish on Peloton long term, so if you long term shareholder it's actually another bad thing that is coming down because they have earnings on November 5th and that could be a pretty good set up for a stock.
BEAR10|"To go up if it if it's not coming in that hot into the earnings, so short term, it could be a little bit under pressure, but long term bullish on peleton."""
