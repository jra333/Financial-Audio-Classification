BULL0|"""Welcome back to fast money."
NEUT1|Coinbase announcing plans to go public via direct listing today.
BULL2|The crypto currency exchange, also announcing its revenues more than doubled in the past year, bring in more than $1.1 billion in 2020, is popular.
BULL3|Names such as Bitcoin and Therium have surged to record highs because we make this valuation.
NEUT4|Well, it's interesting.
NEUT5|I so there's there is a contract.
NEUT6|It doesn't trade for US investors, but there is a contract that has been trading tracing what the coin based valuation would be, and it's implying roughly when it starts trading.
NEUT7|It would be $100 billion valuation, which is fairly eye popping, frankly, because that would mean it is a bigger valuation than see me or ice or something like that.
NEUT8|So if that holds, it's interesting.
NEUT9|The second part of that which I think is interesting is you now can actually if you look at some of the exchange.
NEUT10|Coins like a by ***** or something like that you can start to have a real world traditional finance valuation start to creep into the crypto world.
NEUT11|Here's the question though BK.
NEUT12|Dollar for dollar Bitcoin or Coinbase?
NEUT13|How Bitcoin without a doubt.
NEUT14|Yeah.
NEUT15|Jazz nails you and here's the reason is that God?
NEUT16|Yeah, equities equities are limited lacquers limit on the valuations, currencies are not.
NEUT17|Jeff, would you agree?
BULL18|Yeah, I agree.
NEUT19|I think if you want exposure to the space you want to go into Bitcoin itself and when I try to think about what the value of a coin should be, I mean the supply is fixed right?
NEUT20|So you try to look at the demand side.
BULL21|Actually saw some interesting stats from Ark.
NEUT22|Invest just to try to try to game out what that might look like.
BEAR23|An if you have 1% of corporate balance sheets allocated to Bitcoin, the price doubles.
BEAR24|From here if you have 1% of institutional investors portfolios allocated to Bitcoin, the price doubles.
NEUT25|If they allocate 2 1/2 percent of their portfolios, the price goes to 200,000.
NEUT26|So I think trying to understand how all those dynamics play out.
NEUT27|It's important those aren't large percentages in terms of allocations, but those are big price moves, yeah?
NEUT28|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT29|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
