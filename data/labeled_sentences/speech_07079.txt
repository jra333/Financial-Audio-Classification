BULL0|"""Good morning everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome to live trading action by in the money stocks.
NEUT2|My name is Nick Santiago.
NEUT3|Today is February 11, 2015.
NEUT4|Stock I'll be looking at this afternoon is going to be Coca Cola.
NEUT5|Yes, Coca Cola it's not a big big mover, but one thing I am looking at.
BEAR6|If you take a look at the hourly chart here is this big giant gap.
NEUT7|Fill down here now.
BEAR8|The stock is definitely showing some weakness on the trading session, but when the stock gets down to around this gap fill level where you're going to notice is that level is going to be right around 41 and a quarter maybe 4126.
NEUT9|Forty 127, give or take a couple of pennies.
NEUT10|But that's going to be a good bounce area.
NEUT11|One thing you'll notice here is that right around here you had high volume on the candle going back to the 9th of February, and if price comes back down there again, that's generally where the institutions are going to support it.
BULL12|So again, that would be a good good level.
NEUT13|Also, if you take a little trendline here from pivot lows, what you'll see is they'll be a little bit of a safety net.
BULL14|So if the stock does go through, it will find more support around this trend line, which is going to be right around the.
NEUT15|$41.10 level so you could put a stop right below this little low right here.
BEAR16|41 Bucks 4110 should be a little bit of a safety net if the stock does decline a little bit further through the gap, but either way when I look at right here is just a real good level to get involved in Coca Cola on the long side.
NEUT17|Should the stock trade down there right now?
BEAR18|It's trading at 4195 so you definitely have some more downside working to do before that stock or trade with trigger, but either way, should the stock trade down to this level, that's going to be a very very good bounce area, so keep it on the radar.
BULL19|We'll see if it does get down there, but that should be a nice winning level.
BEAR20|We could look for probably a $0.25 bounce on the stock and you could use basically a stop loss right below the 41 level on closed.
BULL21|"With that being said, everybody I want to wish you all a great trading day and we'll see you on the charts."""
