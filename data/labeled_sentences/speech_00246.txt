NEUT0|"""So I think it's just easier and US China crossfire and I can see it becoming a political football."
NEUT1|So political uncertainties.
NEUT2|Uncertainties is very high for HSBC in May, subject to sanctions from US as well as China so you can see that not only today actually start from last week, it's just busy stock prices under pleasures.
NEUT3|So getting in earlier future they will still lagging behind the handshake index or the general market because.
NEUT4|A lot of uncertainties which is difficult to quantify.
NEUT5|It will, as I mentioned that will affect its vibrations, can be a lot of this bad news though, has been priced in.
NEUT6|You might say, I mean others have questioned whether these banks are looking cheap on a relative basis.
BEAR7|So when it comes to the dip we've had just on the reports today are you surprised to see it moving lower in the range of three percentages?
BEAR8|PC at one point was down 4%?
NEUT9|Or do you think some people will come and take this as an opportunity to buy?
NEUT10|Is this a tough question?
BEAR11|But I do think that for HSBC trading in Hong Kong at around $29.00 attention, Hong Kong dollar or $50 will have some support because as I mentioned before in already dropping down since last week, so it's a very low level and and we when we talk about the people ratio is only point 4.45.
NEUT12|So in terms of valuations is a trip but now is not a fundamental valuation.
NEUT13|Prevented stock prices is driven by the sentiment.
BULL14|"So as we still having a lot of uncertainties, there may be some support in this level, but I still think that they were lagging behind the general market in the near future."""
