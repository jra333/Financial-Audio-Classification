NEUT0|"""It's clear in this via video chart on ticker symbol MVIS."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a rough way to start off the week on this one.
BEAR5|Not necessarily because it was a red day, but because from the technical point of view you know prices broken down below a level of support here.
NEUT6|So certainly updates need to be done for going to the Little House cleaning.
NEUT7|Just get rid of that line up there.
NEUT8|Sure, that level still pertains to the charge is not relevant right now from our presentation standpoint, I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines are really look.
NEUT9|So let's try to keep this as clean as possible, but the first update that does need to be made come about based on a foundation of ruling jarding which states when levels of support are broken and closed below, they tend to act as resistance and that actually played out perfectly today.
NEUT10|I mean, you could throw this right into a textbook.
BEAR11|Well, price broke down below that area right there, so at that point you'd expect it to act as resistance price.
NEUT12|Try to bounce back upwards and look right there where it got rejected back down right at 1260 Mark.
NEUT13|So I'm not saying that level can never be broken.
NEUT14|I'm just saying that if the price does try to consolidate out and then it works way back upwards 1260 is going to be the main level that you'll want to focus on in the near term.
NEUT15|As far as you know, we're not.
NEUT16|The price can actually break up through that level.
NEUT17|And then of course if the price can get up through it, the next level you would want to watch very closely is that Purple line up there.
NEUT18|The 50.
NEUT19|Simple moving average.
NEUT20|As far as levels of support are now concern.
BEAR21|Gotta squeeze down the chart here quite a bit to go further back in the charts.
NEUT22|History next key overarching level of support.
BEAR23|At this point, would now be down there right around $11.65.
NEUT24|So 1165.
NEUT25|Next potential area where the price, no guarantees.
NEUT26|But I don't think I would be shocked to see the price now go down there and at least revisit 1165 so keep a close eye on that and we'll see how things continue to play out.
NEUT27|But yeah, not really.
NEUT28|The best way to start off the new week First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live.
NEUT30|Revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL31|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT38|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot.
NEUT40|Which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT41|If you have any questions, let me know.
NEUT42|"If not, I'll be seeing you soon."""
