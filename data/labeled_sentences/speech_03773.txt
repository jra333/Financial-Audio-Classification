NEUT0|"""In 2014, you may have taken a quiz online, something that looked like this."
NEUT1|And if you did, you probably shared your personal data and your friends personal data with the company that worked for President Trump's 2016 campaign.
NEUT2|Here's how it happened.
NEUT3|It begins with a research firm Cambridge Analytica CAE partnered with a UK based academic Aleksandr Kogan, who was using Facebook data for research purposes.
NEUT4|Quizzes were sent to around 300,000 Americans.
NEUT5|They looked innocuous, over 100 personality traits to agree or disagree with.
NEUT6|And you got paid less than $5.
NEUT7|But there was a catch.
NEUT8|To take the survey, you had to log into Facebook, which gave Kogan access to your profile, including your birthdate, location, and most importantly your Facebook likes.
NEUT9|Kogan combines the quiz results with your Facebook data to develop a psychometric model, a sort of personality profile.
NEUT10|He then combined this with voter records and sent them to Cambridge Analytica.
NEUT11|CA claims that these models were the heart of how they profiled you.
NEUT12|You're in your role, sees another exploitable traits, but Kogan and CA didn't stop there.
NEUT13|His app also grabbed the personal data of your Facebook friends and compiled similar profiles of them.
NEUT14|In just months, 270,000 people took Coke and survey and the data of up to 87 million friends was also harvested.
NEUT15|Close to 1/4 of all US Facebook users.
NEUT16|See a, then use that data to target people.
NEUT17|Maybe you with political messaging.
BULL18|C8 said this targeting helped the Trump campaign strategy, but the campaign disputes this.
NEUT19|Cogans work claims to be for academic research, but he also shared your information with Cambridge Analytica, a violation of Facebook's policies.
BEAR20|So was it a data breach?
BEAR21|Facebook says no, but no passwords were stolen and no systems were infiltrated.
BEAR22|But Mark Zuckerberg has said it was a breach of trust between Facebook and its users.
NEUT23|"the US Federal Trade Commission is investigating the case."""
