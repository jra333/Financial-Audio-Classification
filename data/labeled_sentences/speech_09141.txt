BULL0|"""Hey everybody."
NEUT1|And welcome to Mondays free video, so the headline says Futures week ahead because every Sunday I share my options week ahead with the members and every Monday I share my futures week ahead in the free video.
BULL2|Today we had an awesome winner in a name called Accent a XON.
NEUT3|And this was actually in our biotech Now product.
NEUT4|So Drew day and I have a product called Biotech.
NEUT5|Now where we share our top ten I think it was eleven biotech ideas and one of the names on there was accent.
BULL6|And did we get a nice surprise today 'cause you can see gapped up higher?
BULL7|It was up 30% at one point.
NEUT8|Now it's kind of pulling back, but the reason why it kept up an accident is in the dementia space.
NEUT9|The reason why it gapped up?
NEUT10|Is because medivation.
NEUT11|Medivation was bought by Pfizer in a $14 billion sale and the CEO of Motivation is known as just a flat out superstar, and so he was offered by 20 different biotech companies finally announced.
NEUT12|And the ball bounced our way for all the biotech.
NEUT13|Now members who had accident this guy comes over to us.
BULL14|We get a 30% jump right away.
NEUT15|Stock was at $12.00 when we suggested it back January 4th and we were looking at the 17 half 22 half may upside call spread buying the 17 hafts selling the 22 halves.
NEUT16|We also were long those seven and a half puts just in case for a little protection.
NEUT17|A little insurance.
BULL18|If we were just flat out wrong, didn't need the insurance, it turned out, but biotech now is our second huge winner.
NEUT19|We had Kite and now we have a XON so I know I got a lot of biotech now.
NEUT20|Happy traders out there, so I want to get a video out.
NEUT21|Congrats to everybody who lived this.
NEUT22|On the premiere portion, we're going to talk about the Futures week ahead.
BULL23|"Thanks guys."""
