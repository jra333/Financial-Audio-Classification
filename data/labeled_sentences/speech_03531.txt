BEAR0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the weekly Gold chart and you can see that we have broken down a bit this."
NEUT1|Is still in a range and therefore I think that the.
BULL2|Market will continue to find.
BEAR3|Buyers will either bounce from here or will go looking towards 1600 maybe 1650, but this is a market that's rising because of central bank printing and that hasn't changed a little bit of a risk off flavor at the moment due to the jobs figure.
NEUT4|But really, at this point I think it is only a matter of time before Trader jump back in.
BEAR5|We've seen these forced liquidations that might be part of what's going on short sellers over in the stock market getting wiped out.
NEUT6|Having to get rid of winning positions in order to protect their account so that happens as well.
NEUT7|"Still like buying the dips."""
