NEUT0|"""Now we're going to take a look at the markets today we have Brendan Conway joining us."
BULL1|We know Yelp had a big day on its IPO and some oil prices to influencing things.
NEUT2|Brendon, how did things wrap up for us today when we talk about the markets afternoon?
BEAR3|Well, we spent the day mostly lower in the major stock indexes.
NEUT4|Last check, we were just down an ever slight hair.
NEUT5|I mean this was kind of one of these days.
NEUT6|Yeah?
NEUT7|I mean it's basically flat to me though.
NEUT8|The real action today took place in smaller stocks.
BEAR9|If you looked at the small cap indexes, they were off by 1% or greater.
NEUT10|The last I checked.
NEUT11|What's happening here and this is also true if you look at fund flows and exchange traded funds.
BEAR12|It seems as though a lot of investors are moving away from the real risk on side of things.
NEUT13|They're starting to book profits because they are wondering if the rally is going to take up take a bit of a pause here.
NEUT14|Certainly what you saw this week basically, is it.
BEAR15|Stock indexes were essentially flat.
NEUT16|And you know, we talked a lot about these big round numbers.
BEAR17|Dow 13,000 indexes have had an awfully hard time getting above those round numbers that supposedly don't mean anything.
BEAR18|It says to me that people are wondering whether the huge gains in the last couple of months need to need to level off for awhile.
NEUT19|Forget, forget about all these companies that make things and do things.
NEUT20|Tell me about Yelp site where people go to complain or say that they love the you know, hamburger at this restaurant big IPO today and it's up after his debut.
NEUT21|So yeah.
NEUT22|60 Yeah, it's sword.
NEUT23|I mean people, people really went for this.
NEUT24|The thing to keep in mind is that Yelp is doing a very similar strategy that LinkedIn and other social media companies did.
NEUT25|They float a relatively small number of shares in the IPO to make sure that they have this first day boom.
BEAR26|What you've seen in the other cases and something people need to watch for is that the follow on trading is a little disappointing.
BEAR27|It certainly was the case for LinkedIn, Groupon, I believe, still hasn't gotten back above its IPO price.
NEUT28|Yeah, my guess is you're going to see something similar here.
NEUT29|I know I know.
NEUT30|Well, Angie's list.
BEAR31|So sorry guys.
NEUT32|One good thing they say.
BULL33|One of the reasons that may have been doing so well today is because Angie's List has been able to kind of maintain a little bit of that first day enthusiasm.
NEUT34|Not quite as much, but no.
NEUT35|Sure.
NEUT36|Again, the same line on line review type company.
NEUT37|I think it's interesting.
NEUT38|Yeah, exactly these sites that use content generator from users for free that give information will do well because they are.
NEUT39|They're sort of this.
NEUT40|They have low cost, they just set up the platform and and let people do all the work.
NEUT41|So, but do you?
BEAR42|I'm kind of sceptical about some of the reviews I was.
NEUT43|Kind of.
NEUT44|I don't know why.
NEUT45|I mean, maybe it's just me, but I always wonder, is there somebody whose father you know you know who owns a restaurant sat on the computer and wrote a bunch of little cottage industry of people who go in or the opposite?
NEUT46|True somebody who had just one bad experience where waiters build something and they are outraged and they go on and kind of popular.
NEUT47|My general sense is that people take a handful of reviews with a grain of salt in a bulk of them is meaning something and you know I mean the whole point of social media, right?
NEUT48|Is that you you can kind of draw message from the din.
NEUT49|Certainly there's 3% this talk with if you're an investor, how do you rate the Yelp IPO on Yelp using five stars?
NEUT50|I have no idea.
NEUT51|I'm gonna give you 3 for potential.
NEUT52|There we go.
BULL53|Well, thank you Brandon for joining us.
BULL54|We appreciate it.
BULL55|"Have a great weekend."""
