NEUT0|"""During the commercial break, we were mentioning that there's a Tesla now in space."
NEUT1|Yes, you like Tesla love Tesla, it's one of our largest Holdings.
NEUT2|Largest in our overall fund.
BULL3|We think that if if Elon Musk's SpaceX can do what they did yesterday in space, right, they're going to be able to produce the Model 3.
NEUT4|They're different companies that the whole it's a whole different same brain trust.
NEUT5|Do you think, by the way, do you eventually rocket science?
NEUT6|You eventually want Tesla and SpaceX to merge?
NEUT7|No, I kind of like things the way they are right now.
NEUT8|I like the focus right, the focus, but in the Tesla story at the you know, we also keep looking at that stock with one big question.
NEUT9|If it walks and talks like a car, it must be a car and so it has four wheels that drives around.
NEUT10|All cars will be automated with AI eventually GM will.
NEUT11|Everybody else trades it up 15 to 16 multiple.
NEUT12|They trade as if every cars being shot to the sun at some stratospheric number, which happens first.
NEUT13|All GM goes to a 300 PE or Tesla goes back to 16.
NEUT14|'cause one of those two has to happen.
NEUT15|No explain that GM is a call option on the future.
NEUT16|The future is electric GM's, not electric yet, right?
NEUT17|It's the internal combustion engine all the way.
NEUT18|The future is transportation.
NEUT19|As a service software.
NEUT20|As a service, you need software engineers for that.
BULL21|GM has great engineers with their hardware engineers.
NEUT22|They had to go by Cruise Automation to get those software engineers in Silicon Valley.
NEUT23|Then you've got.
NEUT24|So you've got two big model changes.
NEUT25|Electric software as a service, gross margins going from 20 to 25, which is the hardware model two 8590%, which is the software as a service model.
NEUT26|Completely different DNA.
NEUT27|This is where Tesla is going.
BEAR28|There's a third problem.
NEUT29|GM has it's called distribution by law.
BEAR30|In many states, auto companies cannot do over the air updates.
NEUT31|Tesla's been doing that regularly.
NEUT32|It updates, it improves performance, it corrects mistakes, flaws, GM cannot do that.
NEUT33|Ann is really going to have to go, maybe through cruise automation, an rebuild a company, right?
NEUT34|And?
NEUT35|Even if they were allowed to do it by law, how do most dealerships get their profits?
NEUT36|It's service.
NEUT37|What are these?
BEAR38|Is GM going to alienate its dealers?
NEUT39|I don't think so.
