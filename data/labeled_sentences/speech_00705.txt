NEUT1|I'm Julie *****.
BULL2|We're seeing market sell off today, but one stock in particular has been getting a bit of a lift up his Tesla shares right now, up about 2% and that's after Goldman Sachs Re initiated coverage of the stock with a buy rating.
NEUT3|Rick Newman.
NEUT4|What's behind this recommendation?
NEUT5|Tesla has been sort of all over the map.
BULL6|It has been all over the map and it's been all over the markets, but it's let's start by saying right before the crisis in the first couple of months of year, Tesla really did seem to be stabilizing as an operation seems to have worked out the manufacturing kinks more predictability in its orders an its finances, and Goldman is one of several firms saying, look, we think Tesla is really well positioned for the future because they've got this lead in electric vehicles.
NEUT7|It's the only thing they do, and one thing that's probably going to happen.
BEAR8|As all the other automakers, the big ones face real, financial stresses are probably going to cut R&D into things that are secondary secondary to what they do, and that is going to be electric.
BEAR9|Vehicles are probably going to be cutting R&D and Goldman is also pointing out that Tesla really does have the lead in over the air updates.
NEUT10|Those are the software updates they can beam directly to the car, which actually can change the functionality of the car.
NEUT11|Tesla really has an advantage there so.
NEUT12|You know, it looks as if Tesla does.
BULL13|We know Tesla has first mover advantage in the market for electric vehicles and Goldman, like other analysts think that is going to give Tesla an even bigger lead than it may have had just a few months ago.
BULL14|And they talked about also having with the compound annual growth rate well over 20% for the next five years.
NEUT15|I'm curious all these discussions wreck about how the world is going to change after this, with people working at home, there's some other things happening now.
NEUT16|The air is cleaner in India, in China in New York City are people going to go back to cars the way we did prior to this crisis are or we going to learn?
NEUT17|Hey, clean air is something we really enjoy and Tesla.
NEUT18|Here's a product you can have and it looks cool.
NEUT19|I think we're going right back to cars.
NEUT20|Depending on cars away we always have, because that's exactly what happened after the 2008 meltdown.
NEUT21|One other factor here we should talk about is oil and gas prices.
BEAR22|So if your interest in buying an electric vehicle was to save money on gasoline, that motivation is evaporating simply because oil prices are so low and most analysts are saying they're going to stay so low.
NEUT23|So there's part of the market that wants to move over to an EV because.
NEUT24|It seems like the right thing to do.
BULL25|They like the fact that it doesn't pollute and the performance characteristics are of EV's are pretty good.
NEUT26|But if you're doing it because you're trying to save money on gas, that is not going to be a factor for the foreseeable future.
BULL27|That's one thing working against Tesla, and you know, we saw after gas prices hit 4 bucks in 2008.
BEAR28|That was a big shock in the industry.
NEUT29|But look what happened?
BULL30|Well, gas prices came down and we're driving bigger SUV vis than ever, and that's what consumers want.
BEAR31|They've just stopped caring.
NEUT32|About fuel efficiency.
NEUT33|For the most part, once gas got cheap again, sorry Adam.
BEAR34|Yeah, I think that long term ISM and looking at the pollution levels might be expecting too much of people.
NEUT35|I don't know.
NEUT36|Rick, I, I think you're probably right.
NEUT37|Alright?
NEUT38|Well, again there's Tesla.
BULL39|Shares are rising by 2% today, well below the price target of that.
NEUT40|Goldman Sachs analyst, which is $864.
NEUT41|They're trading in the neighborhood of 735 or so today.
