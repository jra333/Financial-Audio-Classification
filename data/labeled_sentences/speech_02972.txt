NEUT0|"""Alright, so Facebook is at $277.92 with a market cap of 791 billion."
NEUT1|Absolutely insane.
BEAR2|So today we're down 5 bucks, which is a pretty big amount.
BEAR3|An I think we might drop quite a bit more Facebook since some.
NEUT4|Really deep **** right now, so the FTC is actually suing Facebook.
NEUT5|They actually want to break up Facebook.
NEUT6|Anne.
NEUT7|Will they be successful now?
NEUT8|I don't think so.
NEUT9|That would be crazy if it did happen, but maybe it could.
NEUT10|I think it's just going to come down to.
BEAR11|Well, let me read this first so Facebook on Wednesday became the second big tech tech company, slapped with an antitrust lawsuit when a group of 48 US attorneys.
BEAR12|Led by New York filed suit against the firm, alleging the social media giant is violating antitrust law.
BEAR13|The attorney general say Facebook's violations result from its buying up of competitors and depriving consumers of alternatives that would better protect their privacy, so.
NEUT14|Essentially, antitrust laws and.
NEUT15|Why the FTC wants to break companies up is because competition is good competition.
NEUT16|Causes innovation.
NEUT17|Brings down prices.
NEUT18|You want a competition in the world.
NEUT19|So.
NEUT20|They've got a.
BULL21|Quite quite a solid.
NEUT22|Lawsuit here in my opinion, so that's why I personally believe Facebook won't be split up.
NEUT23|But Facebook will have to sell some assets.
NEUT24|You know Instagram an?
NEUT25|I think they bought Snapchat so they'll they might own Snapchat.
NEUT26|I'm not sure on that one.
NEUT27|But yeah, they definitely have to sell some stuff.
NEUT28|This is how you make that stuff go away and why I believe they've got a solid case is because from an email from Mark Zuckerberg in 2008, it said it's better to buy than compete so.
NEUT29|It's one thing if you're trying to grow your business and you pay fair value for competitor to grow your business.
NEUT30|It's another.
NEUT31|Issue when you just buy them while they're small so they can't become competition to you, so you spend a billion dollars.
NEUT32|Now you eliminate competition and you don't have to worry about anything.
NEUT33|This is where it all stems from an I think they got a solid case, so I think you're going to see some lawsuits come up or some sales, and potentially maybe some other lawsuits.
BEAR34|Facebook is going to drop quite a bit once this hits so.
NEUT35|You know, do research, have some fun, makes money.
