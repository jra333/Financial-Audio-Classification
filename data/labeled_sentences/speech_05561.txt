NEUT0|"""When I think about is something that we left off with last time, I unfortunately didn't get much time to be able to talk about it, which is this concept I really love."
NEUT1|What you said is is that you can't secure what you can't identify.
NEUT2|I mean, that's just that's their common sense, correct?
NEUT3|Yeah, that's right, it it all starts there.
NEUT4|It's you know it.
NEUT5|It kind of sneaks up on you little bit.
NEUT6|It's so obvious when you think about it, but we take a lot of identification today for granted and look in the physical world.
NEUT7|We as humans, we've been designed to recognize people in the digital world.
NEUT8|You don't have any of the same cues that we had in the physical world, so we're ultimately recreating in the digital world all the mechanisms to provide.
NEUT9|And assurance that you're actually dealing with the person you think you're dealing with, and because of this it is a new problem.

NEUT16|Enterprises have been doing identity based security for some time, but it wasn't the center of their security construct.
NEUT17|We we've lived in a world of big Moats and even bigger walls, kind of the Castle philosophy of security put everything of value behind a wall and then somehow it's safe.
NEUT18|Put the unknown bad actors on the outside, presumed that the good actors on there on the inside, and you know everything is great.
NEUT19|But this world that we live in now doesn't respect.
NEUT20|Those walls on those motes and everything of value is now outside, so we need a new security paradigm.
NEUT21|We need one in which people can work from anywhere.
NEUT22|We have a reality in it that the applications were accessing are are in the data center were still accessing mainframes.
NEUT23|In large enterprises.
NEUT24|We also have sass and cloud applications.
NEUT25|On the other side, we just want to make it easy for end users to do their job.
NEUT26|Authenticate once, get access to everything that you need access to.
NEUT27|That's the new paradigm.
NEUT28|And in that paradigm is all based upon.
BULL29|Strong identity.
