NEUT0|"""Krista, thanks for being with us and what are your thoughts on sort of this NFT tax that many have been unaware of?"
NEUT1|Is this a conversation in your circles when you're thinking about selling pieces of NFT's art?
NEUT2|Well, basically right now I think the smart thing to do is not to cash out and to keep your your funds in crypto.
NEUT3|And you know just to wait till it's better time to plan an exit strategy and have a proper tax plan in place with, you know, tax lawyers or professionals.
BULL4|Right, but many people actually buying NFT's like the buyer of people's digital work are able to do so because they've seen incredible gains in in crypto currencies.
NEUT5|So if they can't use their crypto if they shouldn't cash out, does that really limit the market here?
NEUT6|No, I believe that a lot of people are.
NEUT7|Basically, you know, hedging their their values and investments in crypto right now.
NEUT8|And right now the bull market is just starting.
NEUT9|So basically people are waiting for that bull market to write out, and I think that the bear market will be where people start to exit this by going to happen near the end of the year.
BULL10|So we're going to have a very strong FT market this year this summer.
NEUT11|Specially that's my prediction.
NEUT12|So Krista tell us about Mars house and the design involved.
NEUT13|And where you see the purchase of this sort of 3D blueprints, you know artistic experience going next.
NEUT14|So for me, Mars House basically is a representation of the next generation of NFT art.
NEUT15|Right now.
NEUT16|A lot of the art that's currently available on platforms.
NEUT17|It's a very limited.
NEUT18|Parameter of height and present the art because it's presented basically as a digital file.
NEUT19|Beautiful drawing or video on your screen.
NEUT20|But you know my intention was to look beyond that.
NEUT21|So NFT NFT can go into an augmented reality 3D asset.
NEUT22|You know space for me.
NEUT23|I actually foresee that we will be living in an augmented reality lifestyle within a very short period there already.
NEUT24|You know an app called Super World that has completely interface the entire globe and is selling virtual real estate that's transposed on top of real.
NEUT25|You know real estate so you can buy time Square virtually and then you can actually put digital assets by digital assets and placed them there.
NEUT26|If you wanted to in Super World.
NEUT27|So this is where the future of NFT's are going to progress.
NEUT28|So Mars House knowing this and having this in mind, I wanted to create.
NEUT29|The first digital house that can actually be experienced as an emerging immersive experience and augmented reality, and you can actually eventually, you know, put it in your actual, you know, real space throughout minted reality experience, because within a year Apple has announced that they're going to, you know, launch their Apple glasses.
NEUT30|I would say that within a couple of years we're all going to be living in an augmented reality lifestyle and we're going to be decorating our environments and our personal space or fashion.
NEUT31|Just like tattoos, you know.
NEUT32|People express themselves, attack chooses an art form.
NEUT33|Well, people are also going to express ourselves.
NEUT34|Digital assets and Decker decorative pieces and collectables.
NEUT35|Fashion accessories.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
