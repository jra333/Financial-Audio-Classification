NEUT0|"""Well, as we've been saying, a busy day."
NEUT1|In fact, I think we can call it a merger Monday this morning.
NEUT2|Given the plethora of deals, the biggest of which though, was actually announced on Saturday.
NEUT3|That is the giant pharma deal, 39 billion, or at least that is what it was worth when announced.
BEAR4|Given the decline in Astra Zeneca's stock price, it may not be quite worth that.
BULL5|But you can see shares of Alexion are up dramatically, of course.
NEUT6|Again, I am talking about Astra Zeneca and Alexion entering a definitive agreement in which Astra Zeneca will be buying Alexi on the consideration, there was 60 bucks a share in cash and 2.1.
NEUT7|1243 Astra Zeneca.
BEAR8|American depositary shares and again we will keep an eye on those because they did appear to be down as much as 6% and no real overlap between these two companies.
NEUT9|I'm told by the way that they did begin speaking in the summer.
BULL10|Let's call it late summer of this obviously this year, and that the approach was made by by Astra Zeneca and clearly they made a lot of progress.
NEUT11|Now could there be another bidder?
NEUT12|Some would say, because perhaps the premium not as large as some might have anticipated.
NEUT13|Seems unlikely doesn't appear that there was a fully competitive process or a competitive process in any real way, but at the same time, Jim, you're talking about Astra Zeneca, which has the currency here, which is more highly valued than many of the pharma companies that competes against and being able to use that in conjunction as well with cash.
NEUT14|There's not many companies that come along in part with 40 billion in cash.
NEUT15|For what about a $6 billion revenue?
NEUT16|Company obviously has some important therapies.
NEUT17|In rare disease, the chief one amongst them is this ilaris.
NEUT18|This monoclonal antibody that is used in a number of different treatments.
BULL19|You have to hope that the pipeline people say is strong.
NEUT20|Makes this deal worth it.
BEAR21|I also think that there are people who will say, well Astra Zeneca not doing that well in the vaccine business, so it's got a kind of a double negative.
NEUT22|I feel that these companies this company has done nothing for years in terms of stock price, which I'm sorry with Alexia.
NEUT23|Well they had remembered for awhile.
NEUT24|They were thought to be in any candidate.
NEUT25|Then they ran into some serious execution issues and or some other regulatory issues.
NEUT26|Replaced management which is cleaned everything up but their own shareholders.
NEUT27|Didn't seem crazy about their acquisitions or let's call it their capital allocation.
BEAR28|I mean, remember how much the stock went down.
NEUT29|I think when they bought that smaller company, what was the name of it Port Ola that was?
NEUT30|Yeah?
NEUT31|And then who was Elliot?
NEUT32|Yeah, Nelly is Elliot is a significant owner.
NEUT33|Well I have to tell you I think this is a gift for shareholders because the reason why I think it's gift just because they've been suffering.
NEUT34|But also there is a pipeline here in the pipeline was about to come to fruition.
NEUT35|This one drug, David, is not something you buy a company for.
NEUT36|I don't understand Astra Zeneca.
NEUT37|I think a lot of people don't.
BEAR38|They stock has been terrible and then they talked up the vaccine more than anybody.
NEUT39|I felt they had been other than Moderna an now what is going?
NEUT40|Would you take their vaccine after what's going on?
NEUT41|No it yeah.
BEAR42|The data that they shared in the way they shared it was a little unsettling I guess.
NEUT43|Yeah, well, particularly the mistake in the terms of the dough, sing and then they went with the half dose and that was odd.
NEUT44|As for Alexion, again it is an X has an expertise in rare disease development.
NEUT45|And commercialization they are talking about the fact that they have 11 molecules across more than 20 clinical development programs and a spectrum of different indications.
NEUT46|And again they do have products on the market.
NEUT47|This is not a pre product 6 billion or so in revenues.
NEUT48|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT49|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
