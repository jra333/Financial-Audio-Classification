NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|If you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume an well above average volume on the day.
NEUT4|So let eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's play map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
BULL6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal Weekly would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price.
NEUT7|Could say up there above 3220.
NEUT8|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3220.
BEAR9|I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage to stay above that level.
BULL10|That would definitely be a massive sign of power moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right they were being defined as the move.
NEUT15|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT16|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the Bulls are in full control rights.
NEUT17|Visualize that that is what has been presented again.
NEUT18|Yes and about 3220 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line.
BULL19|The Bulls 100% on the chart as far as levels of resistance.
NEUT20|Let's squeeze this thing down here a little bit.
NEUT21|Next key battleground to watch moving forward, going to be right up there at the 3250 Mark.
NEUT22|So 3250 Public Enemy number one moving forward.
NEUT23|And that's just simply coming from these highs from back here in early December.
NEUT24|But any angle you look at it monster volume today.
BULL25|Very very impressive.
NEUT26|Price movement.
BULL27|Not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT28|Let's see what happens, but still a couple days left this week.
NEUT29|So still plenty of time to see just exactly how the price is going to behave after such a powerful movement today.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.

NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT36|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
