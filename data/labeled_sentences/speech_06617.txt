NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BEAR1|Today will be looking at USD CAD on the daily chart so zooming in we can see that the loonies recent positive impetus of a multi year low has been muted by the multiple lines while the Captain 50 Day simple moving average and the linger in each model cloud overhead have once again guided the pair downwards.
BEAR2|Hi Mark lines are promoting negative momentum while all Smas are reinforcing the bearish structure.
BEAR3|Positive sentiment seems to remain subdued, something also being reflected in the short term oscillators.
BULL4|If they chacalines managed to keep price improvements at Bay, initial support could come from the 37 1/2 month low of one point.
BULL5|2365 diving beneath this will revive the broader negative bias and may pilot the pair towards the key.
NEUT6|February 2018.
NEUT7|Twelve of one point 2250.
NEUT8|Ahead of the one point.
NEUT9|2195 low.
NEUT10|*********** from here the price may aim for the one point.
NEUT11|2118 low and the vital truth of one point 2060, both identified in September of 2017.
BULL12|In the event, buying interest increases the area between HMO call lines from one point 2523 to one point 2556 and the adjacent one point 2589.
BEAR13|Barrier could impede the price from challenging the 50 day MA.
NEUT14|At one point 2649.
BEAR15|Further, efforts to improve may be futile as the Bulls will need a more profound push to overcome the heavy cloud and the one point 2762 high reinforced by the 100 days may overhead.
NEUT16|At one point 2781.
NEUT17|Yet successfully doing so, buyers may then examine the next resistance at the one point 2880 high.
BEAR18|Summarizing, USD CAD seems suppressed by bearish pressures which continue to dictate a downward direction in the pair.
BEAR19|Any efforts to tilt the picture positive may be pointless unless they extend past the one point 2880 high.
NEUT20|That's it for me.
BULL21|"Have a great trading day."""
