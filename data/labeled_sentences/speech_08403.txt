BEAR0|"""Really, perhaps they see a mismatch there."
NEUT1|As Meg said, you're losing.
NEUT2|Was it 19 billion in revenue, replacing it with three and a half billion?
NEUT3|But they of course have other other things happening too.
NEUT4|Is it just not a good, not a good synergistic fitters?
NEUT5|The price too high.
NEUT6|Well I think this just reflects the basic reality of the drug industry that returns on R&D are just not there the way they were at the start of the decade.
BULL7|You know, Pharma has made tremendous progress in a number of key disease categories, and that's you know they've accomplished that the sales and profits are there.
NEUT8|Generating growth is harder and harder, and we've seen.
NEUT9|Rather, spectacular failures in alzeimers Nash.
NEUT10|Another big you know.
NEUT11|Potential categories this year and I think Abby doesn't.
NEUT12|You know anytime you pay for 45% premium for an asset that's not growing, you're going to get this kind of reaction.
NEUT13|But I don't really see a better move that Abby had.
BEAR14|This this is the result of having a weak hand, and I think there are a lot of weak hands around the industry.
NEUT15|Frankly, from a growth perspective and make maybe that goes back to the point about their size.
NEUT16|You know, we've seen a lot of deals on the smaller side of things in some of these newer areas, but if you want to.
NEUT17|Replace the pipeline this big with something is pretty hard to do, right?
NEUT18|Yeah, how do these companies get growth when they get this big?
NEUT19|And of course, Allegan had been built in a series of acquisitions that CEO Brent Saunders did overtime from Watson to activists to activist, buying Allegan and changing its name to Oregon.
NEUT20|So how did either of these companies grow without doing a mega deal like this?
NEUT21|An rekids?
NEUT22|Alas, the CEO of AbbVie on the call today said they considered a number of different options to try to replace this Humira really patent Canyon.
NEUT23|I think Piper Jaffray put it today.
NEUT24|Or maybe it was Raymond James in a note and they thought about doing smaller acquisitions and those are the kinds of things that the street likes.
NEUT25|If you looked at what Pfizer did with array and it's $10 billion deal people like those kinds of deals because biotech to them signals growth.
NEUT26|But this kind of thing is just plugging a revenue hole and you know people aren't excited about it then should they have waited Charlie?
NEUT27|Should they have gone with the smaller fish?
NEUT28|I don't think so because if you do the same deal that Pfizer did by 2023, you know these deals.
NEUT29|These gene therapy, biotech startup assets may or may not have reached the market, but the debt is very real.
NEUT30|They need certainty to plug that revenue hole and I get that's unappealing to stockholders, but don't be surprised if another rival does something similar down the line that was going to be my quick final question.
NEUT31|We've seen a number of large deals now over the last six months or so in this industry, or is more to come, I think, so I think so.
NEUT32|If activists are unhappy, they should plan on getting busy.
NEUT33|So to speak, Charlie and Meg.
BULL34|Thank you very, very much.
NEUT35|"Charlie Grant and our own maturell here."""
