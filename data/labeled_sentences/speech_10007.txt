NEUT0|"""How's it going you to bring you a very short but useful video?"
NEUT1|Today I posted a video a while back on how to create a Java program to read a stock quote from the Internet, and that was a very long program to do a very simple task, and it's much easier to do on R, so I thought I'd make a video on the short, simple way to do it in R&R is incredibly simple.
NEUT2|All you have to do is first install Quant MoD.
NEUT3|Specify the libraries quant MoD.
NEUT4|An after that, we're just going to use this get symbols function, which I was so happy when I found this function is so much easier than trying to find some other work around, but all you do is specify.
NEUT5|The ticker symbol, the Fromdate, the two dates, so I'm just getting a years worth of data here and then.
NEUT6|This auto sign parameter.
NEUT7|Well, all this does is say if this is true then it's going to name the data PG.
NEUT8|If this is false then you can just go ahead and do your own assignment into whatever variable name you want to do.
NEUT9|But so let's go ahead and run this and I'll show you what we end up getting here and this is going to go out and pull from Yahoo Finance.
BULL10|So very good.
NEUT11|Here's our Procter and Gamble look at that gives you the open, gives you the high low close an really what we're concerned about with is the clothes.
NEUT12|So then we can even go ahead and just extract the clothes, put it as its own variable.
NEUT13|Let's just.
NEUT14|Fun, let's just find the mean.
NEUT15|There's mean 88.25.
NEUT16|We need to plot it quick, do a quick time series plot of the clothes, make sure it looks correct.
NEUT17|Here's our plots and looks good, right years worth of data should be out 252 points for business days.
BULL18|And yeah, everything looks good.
NEUT19|Looks like prices are appropriate, so.
NEUT20|I think it's very useful, especially if you have a small portfolio you want to analyze of a couple of stocks.
NEUT21|Great way to import him into R, then go ahead and analyze whatever you need to.
BULL22|So hope this helps.
BULL23|"Thanks for watching."""
