NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis for Friday, January 26th and Christina Barton, investment analyst that exact.com and today we're going to look at the euro versus the Swiss franc on the daily chart."
BEAR1|So you are Frank, slowed down after it hit three year high at one point.
BEAR2|8031 on January 15 and turned bearish only after it broke below the 50 day moving average which stood out support for quite long time.
NEUT3|That trend, though, remains.
NEUT4|Fish in the bigger picture.
BEAR5|As long as the pair maintains this long term up like started in June, and as far as prices remain above the 200 simple moving average for the moment the risk is to the downside there is.
BEAR6|I made a deep fall for the below 50 for the first time after a quite long time and is currently flat, which means that the market might consolidate for awhile before it potentially becomes weaker.
BEAR7|Magnet History Program has also slowed down below its trigger line.
BEAR8|Further negative signals.
BEAR9|Now looking for support levels in market kootu approach one point 16 which used to be a frequently congested area from mid November onwards and as you can see it's also the lower bound of the chamaco cloud.
BEAR10|Further below 1.15 could also come into you while in the worst scenario the market could break below 1.14, giving up gains made since August and consequently turn neutral.
BULL11|In the long term, however, if prices move higher, resistance would come first from the 50 day moving average at one point 1694, then above.
NEUT12|From here, the next target could be met at the 20 day moving average at one point 7032.
NEUT13|But as you can see, the market.
BULL14|Needs to break above one point 8031 to become bullish again.
NEUT15|An obviously this needs bigger efforts.
NEUT16|Well, now if we assume that this happens, the next resistance will come from one point 19 and 1.20, which were last seen back in 2015.
NEUT17|So that's all from it.
BULL18|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
