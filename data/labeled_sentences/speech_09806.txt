BEAR0|"""Well, if you listen very closely, you can hear the air coming out of that GameStop bubble shares down in today's session by about 25%."
BEAR1|As we continue to see if that stock move lower from that high we saw as all the Reddit trades were made started with GameStop spilled over into AMC and now sounds like biotech plays could be next.
NEUT2|For more on that.
NEUT3|Wanna bring on Yahoo.
NEUT4|Finance?
NEUT5|Is Jerrod blicker E. For more on that chair.
NEUT6|That's for filling the investor love.
NEUT7|Today you take a look at what it's done over the last month here.
BEAR8|Still holding on to 286% of gains, but well off those near $500 highs that we saw last week and just looking at some of the other losers here, we got cost down 17% AMC down 14 expressed down about six and a half and it goes on.
NEUT9|But as you said Zach we are.
NEUT10|We have been single rotation into biotech names this week.
NEUT11|By the way, this is Blockbuster.
NEUT12|It is not a biotech stock just yet.
NEUT13|They haven't done that pivot.
NEUT14|But we have seen a, for instance, Sorento Therapeutics.
BULL15|That's up over 108% over the last month, and also some smaller names like Devex, Dynavax Technologies.
BULL16|That's up over 108% over the last month and CRB P, which is Corbis Pharmaceuticals 116%, so not seeing the huge outside its gains that we've seen in 100 to 200% range kind of become accustomed to that, but we are seeing a mixed board here, so we'll have to see what the end of the week brings for the Reddit space guys.
NEUT17|Yes, my husband pointed out earlier in the week.
NEUT18|You know those biotech stocks were kind of the original.
NEUT19|Take a flyer play.
NEUT20|You know if you get a drug approved or any update in trials that tends to move this talk quite a bit.
NEUT21|Interesting to see Reddit focusing on those and some of the other cheaper stocks, so that's the other main trend is any stock that was below kind of the $5 level that had caught a lot of attention, including with what we saw with AMC.
BULL22|"But Jerrod Blicker appreciate that."""
