BEAR0|"""Now, just like I'm a homes in Co-op, low Adobe and Salesforce are on a collision course."
NEUT1|Lately both companies been coaching each others turf.
NEUT2|They used to be companies with specific products.
NEUT3|Now they offer entire platforms for small and medium sized businesses and then increasingly puts them in competition.
NEUT4|I think this could become one of the great robberies in tech for the next 5 to 10 years.
NEUT5|So who wins?
NEUT6|How typical approach, no emotions.
BULL7|First, the growth rate Adobe projected to grow its sales at 18% clip this year.
BULL8|That number slowing to 16% next year, maybe fourteen.
BULL9|2022 Salesforce is the better #23% growth in 2020 County or followed by 19% next year, maybe 20 percent 2022.
BULL10|On the other hand, Adobe is much higher margins.
NEUT11|It's also got the cheaper stock.
BULL12|Adobe's trading 30 times next year's earnings estimates versus 46 times earnings for Salesforce, although that higher valuation is not hard to justify because Wall Street loves growth and boy do they have growth.
NEUT13|How about their total addressable market or Tam at its Analyst Day last November?
NEUT14|Doby projected that they'll have.
NEUT15|$128 billion total addressable market by 2022.
BULL16|Last year they only had $11 billion of that sales at around the same time, Salesforce posted $168 billion total addressable market, up from 140 billion year before versus 13 billion sales.
BULL17|They both have a ton of room to grow, although it looks like Salesforce has more room to grow.
NEUT18|So which one is the better bet?
NEUT19|I gotta be honest, I'm putting on this one while be rooting for the Chiefs on Sunday.
NEUT20|I can't pick between Salesforce and Adobe.
NEUT21|They are both great, they just appeal to different constituencies.
BULL22|Adobes that Pat Mahons of the software space is fun, creative company.
BULL23|It's become an incredible former recent years.
NEUT24|They want to be the arbiter of how digital advertising looks and feels and their finding tremendous success with that strategy and with E Commerce an with any sort of on the channel strategy.
NEUT25|Salesforce is more like Garoppolo.
NEUT26|It's the game manager of software companies.
BULL27|They're comfortable enough with their own solutions that they want their clients to use them to become better at connecting with the customer.
NEUT28|Their job is distribute the ball efficiently in favor of the clients and not make any mistakes.
BULL29|And that's a fabulous stock.
NEUT30|The bottom line, as this market sells off, and like I said, it's going to on the Corona virus outbreak.
NEUT31|Well, let's just pray that don't be in Salesforce, get sacked so that you can buy one of them.
BULL32|Into weakness, because these are both phenomenal players.
