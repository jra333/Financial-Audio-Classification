BULL3|Rumors of a collaboration between an Iowan Apple Inc are gaining momentum.
BEAR4|Since Apple has announced its entry into the electric vehicle sectors, investors and spectators alike have been spinning rumors on the likelihood of Apple and NIO collaboration.
NEUT5|An Apple analyst.
NEUT6|David says says about the possibility of an Iowan Apple collaborating in some fashion.
NEUT7|I have been studying Apple for many years and I always look at the maneuvers Apple makes when they're about to announce some big news.
NEUT8|First, there are speculations and rumors, then Apple will come out with some promotional tool to fuel the rumor.
NEUT9|Then there in an announcement date of the final product, it looks like we are in the first Phase I think the likelihood of an Iowan Apple partnering is not out of the question.
NEUT10|I would give it a 80% chance apples EV ambitions have had many transformations over the last six years.
NEUT11|Apple initially planned to release an electric vehicle in 2006.
NEUT12|It had to significantly scaled down to focus on their other Apple products.
NEUT13|After all, auto production is a large business that requires a lot of upfront capital, Anna.
NEUT14|Team solely focused on that aspect of the business.
NEUT15|We speculate that Apple is trying to play catch up to Tesla with its autonomous driving technology and electric power capabilities.
NEUT16|Thus the relationship with NIO is very sensible due to two factors.
BULL17|One Anio will help Apple catch up to Tesla in electric technology and autonomous features to an IO.
BULL18|Is Tesla strongest competitor when compared to others in the same field?
NEUT19|They always say that the competitor of my competitor is my friend.
NEUT20|According to SIS, a partnership makes the most sense since Tesla is so far of others in the same sector.
BULL21|Anio is the only company that can possibly overtake or help Apple overtake Tesla's large hold on electric vehicle sector.
BULL22|A collaboration could lay the groundwork for a dual path for Apple and NIO starting to overtake.
NEUT23|Tesla is the most dominate player in the EV sector.
