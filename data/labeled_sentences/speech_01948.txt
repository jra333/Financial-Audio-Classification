NEUT0|"""Hey, this is Chase Forbes former Belmont Abbey Motor sports management."
NEUT1|Soon we're here today it's stock car steel and aluminum.
NEUT2|Based in Morrisville, NC, I got my job here at stock car steel and aluminum via Greg Fanelli, the owner and he came in as a guest speaker to Patrick Woods Motor Sports Management Marketing class.
NEUT3|And I was intrigued by his business model and how this company sells all the metal to the race teams.
BEAR4|And I kept bothering Craig over and over again to try to do a secure job.
NEUT5|I worked with them quite frequently on some of his smaller projects and volunteered all the time and I ended up getting a full time position here.
NEUT6|As of December, he started working here in January.
BULL7|I'm having a great time.
NEUT8|It's it's definitely unique job.
NEUT9|It's not quite like a race team, however, we are racing supplier and that is an outlet.
NEUT10|Potentially take a little bit outside the Steam Race track box.
NEUT11|Here like I said, we sell the metal to the race teams.
NEUT12|Basically every chassis that is going out on the racetrack every week is filled with materials from our warehouse here, and it's always cool to see that you know all of our products are being used on almost every single car every week.
NEUT13|Pretty much every day.
NEUT14|My routine.
NEUT15|I'm definitely involved with the social media aspect of stock Art Studio in Sri our sister company run the Facebook pages for both companies.
NEUT16|We also have a Twitter account.
NEUT17|At Steely Dan ESC essay column.
NEUT18|And some other stuff I do.
NEUT19|I will be random little things that don't have a lot to do with marketing, but you know, every once in awhile have a strange little project to work on.
NEUT20|However, I will also produce Flyers.
NEUT21|I'll produce videos and I will go out to race tracks almost on a weekly basis and do it one on one interaction with people.
NEUT22|Basically customers stock Hartsfield.
NEUT23|Currently I'm trying to capture the dirt market.
NEUT24|We don't have a strong football shirt market as you would on with the paper.
NEUT25|Seems all the way through.
NEUT26|Too late model stocks.
NEUT27|We have a pretty solid foothold there, but I'm really trying to get the dirt market by interacting on a personal level and understanding that kind of audience.
BULL28|"Really enjoying it here and someone having definitely put me in a place where I can work at a job that I really enjoy and I really appreciate you guys coming out here today."""
