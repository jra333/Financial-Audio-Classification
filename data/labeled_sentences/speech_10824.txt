NEUT0|"""Ed Mills over at Raymond James has been with us throughout this hour."
NEUT1|Ed, would you agree with that?
NEUT2|Is this a?
NEUT3|Is this what's happening today?
BEAR4|A permanent stain on the US?
NEUT5|Anan?
NEUT6|How might investors interpret what's happening?
NEUT7|So when I look at the market reaction here Alexis, you know it is off the session highs, but for the most part we're still up for the day because I think there is a recognition here that there is a certain inevitability in terms of what happens on January 20th, and I think when you look at some of the challenges to these Electoral College results, the question is what's the end game?
NEUT8|Because on January 20th at 12:01.
NEUT9|Someone needs to be sworn in president or we go down the line of presidential succession.
NEUT10|And that's a scenario where Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, becomes temporary president.
NEUT11|So it's not as if there is a situation based upon kind of any protest that keeps Donald Trump as president at this point.
NEUT12|So the market is more focused on what are the policies of the next two years with the Congress that was voted in with the final election last night.
NEUT13|What are the policies over the next four years?
NEUT14|They're looking at covid.
NEUT15|They see vaccines being distributed.
NEUT16|They are looking at a reopening.
BEAR17|There is going to be a stain from these events.
BULL18|We have a lot of healing to do.
NEUT19|This is a recognition of how polarized we are as a society.
NEUT20|It is also reminder that when you have different members of Congress and elected officials.
NEUT21|Willing to gin up groups.
NEUT22|There are real consequences for that, and so that should be resolved.
NEUT23|"Reserved when there are honest concerns versus allegations that have had no proof brought in a court of law like what we have seen here."""
