NEUT0|"""Skinny and a weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back Mr. 30th of March 2021.
NEUT2|Two status.
BEAR3|Second day of the week were #27 more narrow whitiker XMR.
BEAR4|So for Monero against PC spec is bad, bad bad.
BEAR5|We're still down in the trenches.
NEUT6|No clear signs of bullishness.
NEUT7|If anything, you also very big mountain range.
NEUT8|One to one more than two months more than four motor five year.
NEUT9|This was actually ahead.
NEUT10|Insurers, do you see left shoulder hit right shoulder boom collapsed again?
NEUT11|We need a bullish chart pattern that points towards the upside right?
BEAR12|We had bearish chart patterns pointing down and we continue dropping lower and lower.
NEUT13|Look at this right bear flag palm.
BEAR14|We drop so things are just not looking good.
NEUT15|Again.
NEUT16|Deciding triangle palm we fail.
BEAR17|Look at this mountain range, right has been bearish.
BEAR18|Chart patterns of the bearish patterns for Monero against BTC.
BEAR19|Just because we already down.
BEAR20|82% doesn't mean we can drop another 70% right?
NEUT21|So so I always always, always say be careful about going to trade.
NEUT22|Do you want to jump into a tree when things are bullish?
NEUT23|Not when things are bearish.
NEUT24|You're attempting to catch a falling knife.
NEUT25|This is not the two solid.
NEUT26|YouTube channel so we discourage catching mice.
NEUT27|Absolutely discourage it.
NEUT28|Unless of course, you know what you're doing and so at this point I'm no clear reversals coming on for Monero yet.
NEUT29|Usually when a bearish trend ends we will go sideways for a while before going back up.
BEAR30|We are still bearish trend.
NEUT31|Where is that site lists?
NEUT32|Where is that sideways fluffy pony here?
NEUT33|There's no just no slight sideways for Monero at this point of time, so be careful, right.
NEUT34|Be careful lest we want to monitor against USD.
NEUT35|Probably for that please give this video like if enjoyed it.
NEUT36|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about more narrow in the comments below for Monero against USD we still have a tablet with the upside.
NEUT37|Yes, we are bearish Monero BTC but we are bullish Monero USD.
NEUT38|You can be both bullish and bearish.
BULL39|Yes, it just means that Monero, NBC are rising together.
NEUT40|Publicity is rising faster so your money would have already doubled moneros to be lagging behind doesn't mean you can treat Monero, it's just that.
NEUT41|PC is flying at the speed of light compared to Monero at this point of time.
NEUT42|Notice by for the past few years.
NEUT43|So your money is better off in PTC anyway, it doesn't mean you can trade Monero.
BULL44|We have a target here $305.00 for 236 and we are anticipating a continuation towards the upside.
NEUT45|I don't know if this is a wave 5 potentially 123344.
NEUT46|We go for a five hits 105.
NEUT47|Maybe it'll be higher and then we complete a impulsive wave right 12345?
NEUT48|And in pump we have a corrective wave.
BEAR49|We **** our correction twister downside.
NEUT50|Then maybe Monero might get a.
NEUT51|Very gigantic abcd.
NEUT52|Kind of a chapter and then Monero continues going parabolic eventually.
NEUT53|Maybe in the year 2.
BEAR54|3/4/2025 which is 4 years away year so.
NEUT55|You know this is just a normal cycle of things.
NEUT56|Bearish bullish, bearish bullish, but you want to be in the fastest car, right?
NEUT57|You know, bet on the fastest car.
NEUT58|You don't bet on the slowest car.
NEUT59|So right now, the fastest car is BTC.
BEAR60|Compared to monero.
NEUT61|There are other cars which are faster than BTC, and if you're smart enough, you can actually put your bets on those cars.
BEAR62|But yeah, on Monero's car we actually slower than BTC.
BULL63|Yes, we are still in the race.
BEAR64|Slower than BTC.
NEUT65|Alright, I guess that's it for my Monero technical analysis.
BULL66|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL67|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT68|"Shall see you in the next video."""
