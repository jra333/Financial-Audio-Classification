NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, nice little day here for Apple.
BEAR5|I mean, there's still a lot of downward pressure.
BULL6|I mean, the past few days from last week, you know, push it down quite a bit, but you gotta give credit where credit is due.
NEUT7|And I think this is also a easy way to kind of just gauge the pound sets occur.
NEUT8|Moving forward is by putting this line into place there and actually let me change that to green, 'cause that's more of a support trendline.
NEUT9|And that right there, like I said, it's going to be a very straightforward and very kind of KISS method way.
NEUT10|Keep it simple stupid to just gauge, I know, is this bond right now?
NEUT11|Truly does it have genuine power behind it?
NEUT12|Is it just some sort of dead tap bounce?
NEUT13|And there's nothing fancy other than the fact of Canada price.
NEUT14|They above because I mean something about it.
NEUT15|Let's say the price came down here and then shot up here.
NEUT16|And then came all the way back down here.
NEUT17|Then shot all the way up there and they came all the way back down here.
NEUT18|Then shot.
NEUT19|I mean that would be a lot of crazy crazy drama, but notice what would still be intact that whole time if the price stays above that trendline, that implies that those lows keep getting higher and higher.
NEUT20|And that is how up trends continue.
NEUT21|So as of right now, yeah, you gotta give credit where credits do a nice little bounce here is underway, but as far as the question of yeah, but I mean, is there any sort of genuine power?
NEUT22|Is there any sort of legitimate strength behind this bounce?
NEUT23|I don't know.
NEUT24|Your guess is as good as mine, but I do know that we have a very easy way up to answer that question and that is to just keep your eye on that red line and as long as the price stays up above it, that is by far what matters most as far as areas of resistance are concerned, the big battleground coming forward is all about that purple line right there.
NEUT25|It's on my chart, denotes a very well known, the very famous 50.
NEUT26|Simple moving average and current value of that is right up there around the 137 mark.
NEUT27|So keep a close eye on 137 if the price does continue to bounce, but All in all.
NEUT28|Nice way to start off the week.
BULL29|Not just a question of can the price continued to build upon this upward momentum.
NEUT30|Let's see what happens.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
NEUT34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me.
BULL35|Unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR38|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT39|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT40|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT41|Then at the end I open it up.
NEUT42|For a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
