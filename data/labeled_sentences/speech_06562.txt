BEAR1|Now we can see that the market has been in a narrow range this week moving around six and a half month lows.

NEUT3|The reason loads are also very close to each other, so this could be.
BEAR4|Are more evidence that the markets down trend may be losing strength for a meaningful rally.
BULL5|However, the price may need to overcome the June peak of 138.32 where the 50 day moving average happens to be at the moment, but before that we may also see resistance coming around 136.50 and 137.40.
NEUT6|On the other hand, it decides to close below 135.
NEUT7|Could retest this short descending line around 133.40.
BEAR8|If this fails to hold for the next stop, could be near the two year old 132.48.
NEUT9|Reached late in December.
NEUT10|Finally about the medium term picture.
BEAR11|The sentiment here remains bearish unless the price breaks above 143.670, in which case the outlook would turn to neutral.
