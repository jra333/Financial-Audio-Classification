NEUT0|"""Cab let's move to the other large cap and two of our guests have a recommendation on Interglobe Aviation."
NEUT1|So let's start with Wish wish we can have the chart vision can have you.
NEUT2|Let's see what the counter is doing.
BEAR3|It's a cell call that's coming in below the 1500 Mark on the fundamental side, I think the results were extremely poor today.
BEAR4|JP Morgan downgraded the counter pretty much.
NEUT5|Nothing seems to be working for it, but on the technical side.
NEUT6|Where do you see this counter?
NEUT7|This is one of the beautiful shot.
NEUT8|I'll tell you version.
NEUT9|What does happen?
BULL10|I think the stock was moving higher and this trend 1900 to 1300.
BEAR11|This was a swift fall after the swift.
NEUT12|What is happening there?
NEUT13|Prices are consolidating in this region and the interesting part in this region when the prices was consulted in sales last one month, implied volatility has come down OK. Now in today's session would have started happening this formation.
NEUT14|This formation side which formation is called triangle formation that is complete coupled with if you see over here this is a ichimoku cloud energy McLeod you're having at this crossover.
NEUT15|This crossover is extremely super crushable so until unless the price is more about this cloud.
NEUT16|Review is going to be banished now.
NEUT17|As soon as this starts breaking down, you can expect the target to come sub, you know, 1300.
NEUT18|So my sense is that stock is sideways.
BEAR19|At the same time, signal on the ichimoku coupled with a negative reversal.
BEAR20|So you see note is a negative reversal.
NEUT21|If you can zoom up the RSL.
NEUT22|Negative reversal is that before price moving above the previous ring, RSI moves about the previous thing.
BEAR23|It is called negative reversal, so it tells you that market moved higher on a lesser momentum, so market did not cross the swing high, but RSI cross the ******* it is called negative reversal and on top of that if you see the edx, edx, entire region has never been able to turn green beans positive.
NEUT24|So right now this extremely super tired.
BEAR25|I would not be surprised to you know stop going down at least 1520%.
NEUT26|In coming days, two weeks, it's at 1475 right now.
NEUT27|If you see it's a positional trade, what's the best strategy?
NEUT28|Should 1 short now?
NEUT29|Should they wait for levels of 1500 to come in?
NEUT30|What's the ideal stop loss on this trade so there can be a lot of things you could do?
NEUT31|Since we're talking about only a positional stock side strategy, a simple way to do shorter one load here.
NEUT32|If there is some pullback shorter.
NEUT33|Second lot in what level?
NEUT34|Till probably you could shorten 1500 or so.
BULL35|â‚¹30 will back also comes we could start.
NEUT36|My sense is that stock is coming to 13 fifteen 1300 now.
BEAR37|Apparently the stock is very liquid in the options also, and the volatility has come now.
NEUT38|So what the another way to play this traders you buy a 1500 put option which is in the money booth option and you sell 2 boot option of 1300.
NEUT39|OK that is the one strategy which is going to put ratio in my opinion isn't in the breakdown voltage will going to be free?
NEUT40|What's the ideal stop loss if someone is playing your strategy at least on the future side you said sale up to 1500.
NEUT41|What is the idle stop loss before this trade becomes null and void?
NEUT42|So I'll tell you.
NEUT43|I mean couple of trades will discuss.
NEUT44|SBI IGL Equetus ennui quitters also followed up very sharply similar kind of a set up that I'm noticing.
NEUT45|"In my opinion, if you start initiating a short at the current level, conservatively use ******* should be about this line, which is roughly about a 1580 sort of 1580 that."""
