NEUT0|"""Got some China headlines to get to this morning."
NEUT1|One was a readout between the first phone call between the president and President Xi of China Axios.
BULL2|This morning, Jim says the administration definitely sees merit in the idea that China is a fierce.
NEUT3|Maybe the most important competitor to the United States.
NEUT4|On the other hand, Jim Reuters has a piece about Goldman BlackRock Fidelity hiring hundreds in China as some of the restrictions on financial services start to open up over there, there's no doubt in those firms are the leaders.
NEUT5|There's no doubt that this was a suppressed move by the previous president.
NEUT6|These companies felt very.
NEUT7|Gun shy to be doing business in China.
NEUT8|Obviously the major issues is whether it will be Taiwan Taiwan's right at the end of the Trump administration.
BEAR9|That was really a lot of Saber rattling about Taiwan.
NEUT10|Taiwan has to be very careful because they their largest customers are Chinese and US, but I think that the dialogue is starting.
NEUT11|This is one of the reasons why we continually beating the drum on Boeing, because this is the way that the Chinese would show that they mean a different kind of business.
NEUT12|And other people here who really wanted to bring back the days before before China.
NEUT13|Opened a Cold War, Stephen this is not a Cold War stance that the presidents take.
NEUT14|David is not a Cold War stand, but there's going to be a point sometime in the not too distant future.
NEUT15|Would imagine we're going to be talking a lot about our relationship with China in a significant way in terms of its impact.
NEUT16|Even on the market.
BEAR17|No, it's not a good relationship.
NEUT18|You know, it's bad, it's competitive.
NEUT19|And we're not winning in a lot of places, right?
NEUT20|And that's an it's not secure, no?
NEUT21|But I'm just saying, but it's not all bad things.
NEUT22|They're all benefits, not, you know.
NEUT23|I think it's going to be done.
NEUT24|The diplomacy is from my understanding.
NEUT25|Now it's very quiet.
NEUT26|Well, it's not going to happen on Twitter that we know it's not gonna happen on Twitter, right?
NEUT27|Jack Dorsey took care of that.
NEUT28|Well, yeah, but also my current president is not interested in using that as his communication platform, but it's just called.
NEUT29|This is it's so fluid what's happening in China now that the president is literally trying to figure out is it?
NEUT30|Is it about suppression is about freedom of speech.
NEUT31|Rights are human rights comes into the conversation in a way that it might not have been, and that can also make things more difficult in some way.
NEUT32|On trade, though I mean.
NEUT33|If there's any area that this administration is somewhat aligned with, the last is probably on China policy.
NEUT34|Notice very, very hard line, but it also involved in climate control, right?
NEUT35|At the same time, if it's done below the surface, it just makes it so more business gets done, and that's what I'm saying.
NEUT36|I find Carl yeah, it's it's.
NEUT37|It's an insecure relationship, but it's not insecure in your face everyday it just won't be.
NEUT38|That's just not the way this President operates.
BEAR39|Peterson Institute did do some work looking at the level of exports to China relative to the initial agreement of Phase One member that guys a little about a year ago and they missed the target by 40% according to Peterson.
NEUT40|But whatever happens, Jim is going to be done through a multinational lens.
NEUT41|There's a scoop out of CNN today that the Secretary of State is planning his first trips in mid to late March and it's going to be with meetings with NATO counterparts talking about issues in Europe but also Asia pack.
NEUT42|When you hear that you know that it's going to cool off because 25% of what they make the Chinese by.
NEUT43|So I mean, a lot of people the previous ministration would speak of those countries as client states of China that when you do reporting on it, this administration is not regard those places as client States and China.
NEUT44|Italy's acquired state Jeremies clients today 'cause of the belt and Road initiative?
NEUT45|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT46|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
