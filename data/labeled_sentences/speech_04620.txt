NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this video chart on ticker symbol LVS."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down there at the volume well above average volumes of the market.
NEUT4|Liked what it saw today in the headlines, but more of the story that I was going to be watching this one moving forward.
NEUT5|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT6|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level weekly one.
NEUT7|Make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward and that would be the price.
BULL8|Could say up above 4865.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below that level.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage step above that area.
BULL11|That would certainly be a great sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and looking at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Simple moving average keyword.
BULL16|Definitely moving.
BEAR17|I get the price is way up here.
NEUT18|This line is way down there but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move, that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT19|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls are in full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT20|How you must visualize that?
NEUT21|That is what is being presented against.
NEUT22|Animal 4865 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line.
NEUT23|The ball is 100% owned.
NEUT24|The chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned, nothing fancy or complicated here, just a question of war departing momentum finally stopped today and that was up there at $50.25, so 5025 will be that next key battleground to watch moving forward.
NEUT25|But All in all, any angle you look at it, monster volume today, very impressive.
NEUT26|Price movement and not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum?
NEUT27|Moving forward, let's the other one closes out the week on Friday 1st off.
BULL28|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT30|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT31|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT35|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR36|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT37|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT38|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT39|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
