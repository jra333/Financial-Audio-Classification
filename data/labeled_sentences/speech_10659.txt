NEUT0|"""To your point about broader options, J&J's on the tape."
NEUT1|Now Jim could have late stage trial results earlier than expected that some targeting January 21, 2140.
NEUT2|Like I just got recruited for that trial last week.
NEUT3|I mean they have just had.
NEUT4|They must have many more people in this trial that I thought this is really huge because J&J and I think we'll find out is this is the vaccine kludt.
NEUT5|I think they're ready with hundreds of 1,000,000 because they had emergent bio doing making these vaccines.
NEUT6|This is one of those where.
NEUT7|You kept hearing about J&J, saying, you know what we're going to make him an if they work, we're going to flood the zone.
NEUT8|We're not going to wait for them to be approved.
NEUT9|We want to make him.
NEUT10|I spoke with the Chief scientist of J&J, who was working on this.
NEUT11|I think he made it pretty clear that I didn't know what I'm talking about, but that's OK because he's a chief scientist, and I I've waited those classes studiously 'cause I wanted a 4.0 but David.
NEUT12|One thing was absolutely certain is that J&J.
NEUT13|Thinks that they have the Holy Grail an I have yet to really make a lot of money betting against Gorski in jail.
NEUT14|No listen.
NEUT15|We're going to wait to the data there.
NEUT16|As you say, it may be coming what within a month, month and a half we may get it and it's funny.
NEUT17|I know people in that trial you do.
BULL18|They clearly are doing a good job recruiting, getting the numbers where they efficient.
NEUT19|Yeah, it's really amazing how good then.
NEUT20|I think the fact that the virus is spreading and raging throughout the country may also encourage some people to say.
NEUT21|Why not?
BULL22|I got a 5050 chance of getting a vaccine that may very well end up being effective.
NEUT23|Why would not want to take it now if possible?
NEUT24|'cause remember you some half get placebo right?
NEUT25|Jim have don't that right so you may get that and I think that's what some people were concerned about.
NEUT26|Is well, wait a second if Pfizer is able to produce and you don't know you don't know whether placebo or the right people got their healthy both in your own right.
NEUT27|But then are you stuck your not going to be able to get the other one?
NEUT28|Now you're held.
BEAR29|Yeah, and that's not good.
NEUT30|But what is good is this idea again that we're going to have a number of vaccines to choose from, so perhaps the administration choosing not to exercise that option on more doses of Pfizer will not prove to have been a big mistake, because there will be a lot more vaccines available when needed.
NEUT31|Remember, Pfizer will certainly get us and Moderna at some will get us through the first quarter, and you'd think all the hospital personnel, all the front.
NEUT32|Many of the frontline people, whether you get to teachers and you know higher risk people as well, I don't know.
NEUT33|But you know, look, I think it's for real.
BULL34|I think that you're going to get to 22 million.
NEUT35|Responders, Yep, and I think that one of the reasons coral that we now know that the markets very prescient.
BULL36|I think the markets been going up because we're starting to realize that this may be for all intensive purposes in America, not in the rest of the world over in the second quarter of 2021.
BULL37|Well, that is, that is a big piece of Goldman's call today, Jan Hatzius up in Q4 GDP tracking Jim from 3/2 to five.
NEUT38|The title of the report is cavalry coming.
BULL39|We're going to talk to David Kostin later on in the hour, but their general point is that this is all coming together, not just in the US, also in Europe, but it's coming together, vest faster than they thought, and that's that means you're going to see some benefit before the end of the year.
NEUT40|Well, you gotta go by the airline stocks.
BEAR41|Now we know why the cruise lines are going up.
NEUT42|You can go back to the American Express of the world.
NEUT43|You could say David, a lot of these have already moved, but you know what?
NEUT44|There are plenty of people who did not expect this all to come together, so.
NEUT45|Quickly, the vaccine collect is the story of 2021.
NEUT46|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT47|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
