NEUT0|"""YouTube YouTube was good as a man, I don't want nobody to think I'm being transparent with them."
NEUT1|I'm only showing them when I'm up.
BULL2|When I'm doing good so we gonna get on here.
BEAR3|We gonna talk about it down 486.
NEUT4|Check out the weed, check out the month, check out the three month check out the year, check out all time a this.
NEUT5|Don't make any sense but.
NEUT6|Whatever, somehow it makes sense to them, but a man down down 46 when you see red old man, it's a lot of it.
NEUT7|I haven't even checked this on wrist today really.
NEUT8|When you see Red Man, it's time to pick up some shares.
NEUT9|This time time, time to be buying time to be buying man when you see red by you I mean like that.
NEUT10|So that's how I feel.
NEUT11|You don't know when the bottom is going to make Vars far as a dip goes OK.
NEUT12|So let's see less prime example right here, right?
NEUT13|Look at this.
NEUT14|You get the shooting up.
NEUT15|You dip down, shoot up, dip down, shoot up, look at every boot up.
NEUT16|Deep down this is like March alright.
NEUT17|Bam bam bam bam bam coming back up OK guys, so that's how that's how a lot of lot of these really work.
NEUT18|Man look Bam got a little dip come back up buyer dip down like bam so.
NEUT19|Damn dip, dip, dip, dip for a long time.
NEUT20|Finally, shoot back up.
NEUT21|That's how to market this.
NEUT22|How to market works?
NEUT23|Man, that's how that's how it is.
NEUT24|No, you don't.
NEUT25|You only lose when you sell.
NEUT26|You only lose yourself.
NEUT27|You got a lot of people.
NEUT28|You want to lose when you say I know sometimes I feel like oh man you will buy something right you will buy something as soon as you buy.
NEUT29|It'll be.
NEUT30|It'll be shooting up.
NEUT31|And in like it go up.
NEUT32|It's so weird like you'll be, you'll be seeing some go up and they go up.
BEAR33|15% it for present and it soon as you buy to start dropping like it just didn't just go up 15% like soon as you swipe up or you go to buy they start to drop.
NEUT34|But look man, it's me bottom dips.
NEUT35|In certain cases, good things will start to happen.
NEUT36|You know I'm saying and you only lose when you sell, so when you going down and when you get negative you can't get all emotional man.
NEUT37|Don't don't be us, Oh my oh man, I just want to get it.
BEAR38|I'm losing money dude by the dip.
NEUT39|Play it how how I kind of say play it when it drops.
NEUT40|Maybe like a $10 five dollars.
NEUT41|You gotta try to find the bottom.
NEUT42|You know what I'm saying.
NEUT43|Like with some of these plays man and think about the bigger picture all the time.
NEUT44|That's why I never like it's down in trip and I happen to sell nothing 'cause you only you only lose when you sell like that's me cell in a K negative is stupid, it could pop back up.
NEUT45|It could pop an compile back up to that $2.00 and look at my average cost 76.
NEUT46|I'm up a lot of money at that point that also shares of it so.
NEUT47|I just want to be transparent, don't want people to be like are rich only shows when these shows the good Nah man.
NEUT48|Hey this my paper and I ain't got no problem showing it.
NEUT49|You know I'm saying so yeah.
NEUT50|Get some scanning again.
