NEUT0|"""How about the nine winners?"
BEAR1|Let's start with the weakest of the budget Union Pacific Newport number selection over drop 20 to 30% better.
NEUT2|The Dow, the SP.
BEAR3|But worse than the bulk of the goal list.
NEUT4|So I mean, but relatively the rest.
NEUT5|The goal is, but wow, these are very exciting like the rest of the rails.
BEAR6|Union Pacific's been on fire for last couple months, these guys reported Thursday morning.
NEUT7|By the way, Red Sox in Raleigh, no matter what, that's 'cause they do this precision railroading.
NEUT8|It makes it so they're much more efficient than they used to be.
BULL9|Nucor the best of the American steelmakers got a huge boost in November if the vaccine again, and then another boost early this month after the Democrats swept the Georgia Senate.
BULL10|Runoffs Wall Street spending will get a big infrastructure package and you can't build infrastructure without steel Nucor still a cheap stock 2.9% yield.
NEUT11|I gotta tell you I like this, especially for those looking for a cyclical that still has room to run.
BEAR12|As for Emerson Electric Classic smokestacks stock they reported quarterly.
BULL13|Remember even before the vaccine, they were doing terrifically because they've got a ton of exposure to China and we know China is doing very well.
BULL14|The stocks went from 65 in late October to 83.
BULL15|Today a new all time high and I think it's got more room to run.
NEUT16|There's going to be retiring CEO at a new one coming in.
NEUT17|Who made break the company up?
NEUT18|We don't know, but there's a lot of excitement here.
NEUT19|Next up, we've got the middle of the pack.
BULL20|The goal is stocks that are up 30 to 40% PPG.
NEUT21|Yeah, the paints, coatings, Disney and Nike PPG's paints and coatings are on fire.
NEUT22|They got a ton of exposure to the red auto industry at the Hyatt, particularly there also.
NEUT23|Biggest part of the home builders.
NEUT24|Two triple markets.
NEUT25|While the stock split on there, I think it's worth sticking with this one.
NEUT26|It's really well run Disney.
NEUT27|So weird one you think this will be a textbook pandemic play?
NEUT28|Not a great time for the movie theater at the theme park business.
BULL29|But because disease launched a popular streaming service a little over a year ago, the stock quickly recovered from the March lows.
NEUT30|Then we got Pfizer vaccine data.
NEUT31|This thing called fires, now trading like a reopening play.
NEUT32|Well, Disney seems expensive.
NEUT33|Attorneys, I like it up here.
NEUT34|I know a lot of people want me to like AMC, which is a little stock that is good that can run here.
NEUT35|I don't know.
NEUT36|It's the same group that wants me to recommend BlackBerry GMM.
NEUT37|I will wait.
NEUT38|Also they like whatever?
NEUT39|Alright palantir.
NEUT40|I don't want to do anything more than say that's what they're thinking about, but I know that's what they're thinking about.
NEUT41|Now let's talk about the kind of stuff they should be thinking about Nike even before we saw the light at the end of the tunnel, Nike was already making new all time highs as China bounce back in Athleisure became the style of choice for people working from home while the stock is expensive, Nike keep shooting the lights out with spectacular digital with.
NEUT42|Yes, it is like Lulu.
NEUT43|I know that like williams-sonoma, these are all kind of well run companies that are figured out now.
BULL44|Thanks to the pandemic and being able to cut out the middleman at Nike and Solar Product Direct to the consumer.
NEUT45|We're not going back.
NEUT46|Once again, I'd stick with Nike.
NEUT47|It is the best direct consumer story out there.
