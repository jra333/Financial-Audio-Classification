BULL0|"""Hello everyone and welcome back to the channel."
NEUT1|Today I wanted to talk about XP, Angie and to tell you whether it is a good buy or not at the current price.
BEAR2|Currently the stock is on a three day downtrend coming down from the $59 area to as low as $48.00 as the world is currently looking at the short selling situation around the world involving stocks such as GameStop, AMC and many others.
BULL3|It is a great idea to grab some undervalued shares of other companies.
NEUT4|First of all, let's talk about figures.
BULL5|In the beginning of 2021 is being announced that they have delivered more than 5700 vehicles in December 2020 alone, which is a 326% increase year over year and a 35% increase month over month.
BULL6|It is worth noting that the quarterly results were also huge for the company as they delivered more than 12,900 vehicles in Q4 of 2020, which resulted in a 303% year over year increase and a 51% jump from the previous quarter of 2020.
NEUT7|The other super important reason why you should invest in the company now is the evolution of autonomous driving.
NEUT8|The Chinese company is setting itself apart from its peers by leveling up its autonomous driving game.
BULL9|The company recently unveiled a partnership with Chinese lighter company Livox to deploy lighter technology in Spang's new production model in 2021.
BULL10|This is huge for the company considering it's the world's first mass produced smart ABS equipped with lighter and that would solidifies bangs, cutting edge position and smart of technology.
BULL11|In particular, his bangs autonomous driving system called the XP Ilot will see increased safety and ability to cover a comprehensive range of driving scenarios.
NEUT12|If you believe that lighter is the future XP, the stock could be a goodbye.
NEUT13|That's especially if the company maintains its head start in this Department.
NEUT14|One thing is clear now, electric vehicles are here to stay and only best of them will grab the market share needed to dominate China and other countries in the future.
BULL15|X PNG seems like an amazing buy at the current price.
BULL16|And it's currently the second leading Chinese manufacturer in China, just after Neo.
BULL17|It is also worth noting that the company reached its highest price of $76 per share in November 2020.
NEUT18|So you are basically buying the stock at a huge discount.
NEUT19|"Thank you for watching and as always, please subscribe to the channel if you are interested in the latest news about the company."""
