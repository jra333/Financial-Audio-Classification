NEUT0|"""Guys, welcome to YouTube short today."
NEUT1|I'm expecting very much volatile market, especially nifty Bank, because if you see the upside level then this is the first level which I see as upside resistance which is near 33,000.
NEUT2|If that's broken, then thirty 3250.
NEUT3|Here.
NEUT4|This one.
NEUT5|An on the support side.
NEUT6|This is the level 32,500.
NEUT7|Thirty 2500 has been broken then yesterday's low will be very crucial or I can say 32,000 will be very crucial.
NEUT8|"So if you need a upset rally on one way 33,000 or on the downside 32,500."""
