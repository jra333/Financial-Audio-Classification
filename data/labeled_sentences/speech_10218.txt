NEUT0|"""Big, the big difference is that what we see now is the Fed expansion and the CARES Act has actually put money into bank accounts, checking accounts, savings accounts, payroll accounts far greater than anything we did during the financial crisis."
NEUT1|In fact, if you look at the M2, which is the broadest money supply, the increase in 2020 and this is really quite startling.
BULL2|Greater than any single year in the last 150 years, we have data going back to 18 seventy 25% increase.
NEUT3|We have never had that as a one year increase and when we've never had a deviation.
NEUT4|Normally this money takes anywhere.
NEUT5|612 maybe 18 months to really push into the economy an I think the rising inflation that we're going to see as the economy opens.
NEUT6|Up this year is going to cause bondholders to say, hey, you know I'm not going to accept 1% anymore on my bond if my dollars are going to be appreciating in front of my eyes, they're going to demand higher yields and that is why I'm a Big Bear on Treasury bonds.
NEUT7|David?
NEUT8|Why do you disagree?
BULL9|Well, look, there's no question that we've had gargantuan monetary and fiscal stimulus.
BEAR10|I would argue that without it we'd be in a even bigger overall deflationary environment then we're in right now, so I really just think that the central bank is moving aggressively to prevent a horrible outcome.
NEUT11|I don't think that there be inflation coming out of it.
BULL12|I think there might be less deflation.
BEAR13|You can't just forecast inflation with the money supply, you have to take a look at the velocity of money and the reality is that the velocity of money is declining one for one.
BEAR14|With the run up of the money supply and that's why you've had a situation where this time last year inflation is running above 2% right now, inflation measured inflation is running little more than 1% and the bottom line is this.
NEUT15|You have to have a supply and demand framework.
BULL16|It's not as if we're seeing this huge stimulus at a time of full employment.
BULL17|Full employment is way out there in the future.
NEUT18|We have an outlook app in the US economy.
NEUT19|We're talking about the overall level of idle capacity relative to GDP.
BEAR20|The output gap is acute now.
NEUT21|As it was in the fourth quarter of 2008, ultimately we got cyclical inflation about five or six years later.
NEUT22|That's how long it may take this time around, but we're just really climbing out of a big hole right now.
NEUT23|This is not about promoting inflation, despite what the so-called experts are saying.
NEUT24|It's about preventing a Japanese style deflationary outcome.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
