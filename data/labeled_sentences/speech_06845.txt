NEUT0|"""Hello everyone Michael here Co-founder Path Trading Partners."
NEUT1|Long pole via Chino.
NEUT2|We got a request for Amazon and now assists.
NEUT3|Let's just take a look here.
NEUT4|These are the two major levels I'm watching it.
BULL5|We've now we had a potential double.
NEUT6|It was actually confirmed but not triggered.
NEUT7|Double top here.
NEUT8|Then it ran off and we turned into a triple top.
NEUT9|Now triple top.
NEUT10|Slightly favor a continuation pattern.
NEUT11|But it's not huge odds, so it's not like, oh, let's just come up with the bullishness load on the shares, because it might be a continuation pattern.
NEUT12|Now that's why I'm watching this.
NEUT13|3250 level get a move above there.
BULL14|I'm back to bullish Mode next targets higher 3401 thirty 458.
NEUT15|Those are the next minor ones.
NEUT16|The next major targets would be a lot higher.
NEUT17|There coming from here.
NEUT18|So I just did update.
NEUT19|I did a reverse gang box because it's backwards in time.
NEUT20|The major levels will just go to 3560 and then 3773, so those are all the levels now.
NEUT21|We still.
BEAR22|We still from the gap up after earnings.
BEAR23|We still haven't fully filled it, so if it continues lower let me just now dropped to four hours.
NEUT24|So if we really if we get full, start getting below about 3100 thirty 110.
NEUT25|Say about 3110 I will start watching for the gap fill which would take us a bottom.
NEUT26|The four hour rotation zone and this is not a strong rotation zone 'cause it's minor separation.
NEUT27|Well in consolidation or congestion.
NEUT28|If we drop below that gap will be watching about 3000.
NEUT29|A rotating backup.
NEUT30|That 3251 is resistance above there 3344 thirty 401 thirty four 5835 sixty 3773.
NEUT31|Just to reiterate, now, if we do get below 2930.
NEUT32|There that gap's been filled, that gap's been filled, so the area I'll be watching is 2850, which is the rising 50.
NEUT33|Let's just take a quick look at the weekly.
NEUT34|The weekly is very overextended, fought from the rotation zone, but the rotation zones right at just above that 2930, so 2950.
BEAR35|So there's major support down here, so if it does dip back down if it closes on a weekly basis.
BEAR36|Below this about 2930 area then I'd start watching for the bigger pullback, but as long as this area holds it's still in this consolidation pattern.
BEAR37|Burning off an overbought patterns so you see here it was very overbought in the weekly basis, now just dropping down.
BEAR38|Because it's moving sideways, momentum is waning and the rotation zones catching up, so it's still in bullish case on the weekly.
BULL39|Bullish case on the daily.
NEUT40|With the rotation zone, but we're in consolidation, but it's also with the triple top and four hour is just neutral.
NEUT41|At this point we don't have enough separation.
NEUT42|I'm really saying I'm saying 4 hours neutral, but daily and weekly are still bullish.
NEUT43|So what we have for you on Amazon will talk to everyone soon.
NEUT44|"Bye for now."""
