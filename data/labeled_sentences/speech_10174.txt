BEAR4|Cars under 5 bucks.
NEUT5|So 4.974 point 9 to 7 we can say.
NEUT6|And if we look at their closes or opens we can get some ideas out of it.

NEUT9|There are scores 4.97 and times 1300.
NEUT10|Their days range is four point 2900, two five point 3400.
NEUT11|Their 52 week range is one point 6600 to 99.
NEUT12|We can say N 9 their volume is 15 million 600 and 38,720.
NEUT13|And their average volume is 9,735,925.
NEUT14|Now that we know are bitter about it, a bit about the updates was happening.
NEUT15|So for now let's go look at the chart and see how they've been doing in the previous hour's previous 24 hours and just how the stock is doing.

NEUT21|So we if we count from 1:38 PM around yesterday.
NEUT22|Today is the sound or the day before yesterday even actually yesterday yesterday it was at 5.75.
NEUT23|That and I made a video body that are like around back there.
BEAR24|Here, even before that and right now, it went low as four point 97.
NEUT25|That's what it is, and there can be some patterns here that the guys can understand.
NEUT26|So as you guys can see, there's like a line going from like here till there.
NEUT27|Then there's another line going from here till there that can be some patterns and then again and then this can happen again and this can go up again.
NEUT28|So is I'm just saying don't invest based on what you see in my videos.

NEUT30|Actually, let's look at the past five days and see how they were doing for the past five days.
NEUT31|So this is the results shown for the past five days.
NEUT32|As you guys can see again, look at this.
NEUT33|It goes straight down and then this can.
NEUT34|This can mean that if it goes straight down from here it can go straight up, but we still do know.
NEUT35|So if you guys know how to read patterns the right way, you guys can understand this way easier than I can.
