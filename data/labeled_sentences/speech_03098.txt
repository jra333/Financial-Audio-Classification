NEUT0|"""Well hello, folks are my little and this is today's short take."
NEUT1|You know, we've been talking about the Fang stocks the last two days as the market has crumbled today we're going to pick up another one.
NEUT2|Netflix.
NEUT3|Let's take a look at that one.
NEUT4|Here's Netflix on the chart.
NEUT5|If you look at it, you can see that the buyers want to jump this in weakness.
NEUT6|In other words, you gap down a couple of days, pick spike up on Wednesday.
BEAR7|Thursday tries to follow through, can't write with a weakness in the market, but this is on a weak market.
NEUT8|Where Netflix finds buyers as it gets towards the you know the lows.
NEUT9|So where the volumes are right, Netflix finds buyers that's a bullish sign on a very short term basis if you pull it back, put it on a weekly, it's just consolidating, right?
NEUT10|You kind of got this breakout bar here, right?
NEUT11|The one prior to it.
NEUT12|Then you've got this big consolidation.
NEUT13|That's kind of taking place in this top range.
NEUT14|You know the key by if one were able to get it would be back into this bar, but I don't know if it's going to give it to you and you got three swing point lows down here that would accelerate it.
NEUT15|Actually, there's four that would accelerate it down where it to break.
NEUT16|And so if you're playing Netflix, you know this area right here, right?
NEUT17|Or if you're in Netflix, this area right here is kind of the key area.
NEUT18|Yeah, it could dip down into here and then bounce straight back up.
NEUT19|That would be the ideal place.
NEUT20|But you're going to have to have some stop down in here somewhere, right?
NEUT21|And in case this thing off these multiple swing points breaks to the downside, right?
NEUT22|Because you could get you could get some fast moves to the downside if all of these point points break.
BULL23|That's worst case, but right now range trading is still look strong to me.
NEUT24|Bring it to a monthly consolidations, right?
NEUT25|You come off of a huge riffs that took place here, make new highs, consolidate, make new highs, consolidate Netflix.
NEUT26|Probably going to consolidate for awhile, and eventually you know if you believe the trend.
NEUT27|And that's what Neil Classical is about.
NEUT28|You have to expect it's going to try to break higher before it's all over.
NEUT29|That's Netflix and that is the third of the four Fangs will take.
NEUT30|The last one on Monday.
NEUT31|That's Google.
NEUT32|"Until then, take care."""
