BEAR0|"""Now I want to get to some breaking news on Disney Jerrod Blicker here to fill us in, it looks like they're delaying the release of five new films and a couple of highly anticipated movies are going to hit their streaming service Disney Plus first."
NEUT1|Yeah, well, at least at the same time that they hit the theaters.
BEAR2|And that's not good news for theaters.
BULL3|They've been really been banking on the reopening and also the ability to lure in people to watch a movie on an exclusive basis, even if it's for a short period of time.
NEUT4|But here are the details.
BEAR5|And by the way, even Disney stock is down on this move and I'll get to the details in a second.
NEUT6|Let's just check out this chart here.
NEUT7|Here was the release time approximately.
NEUT8|You can see kind of went sideways and then down, but you take a look at what's happened.
BEAR9|Some other stock AMC was already down big before this.
BEAR10|It crashed on this news, so it's down 16% intraday.
BEAR11|We're seeing Cinemark down 6%.
NEUT12|Also some of the foreign operators, but here are the details on Disney.
NEUT13|So Black Widow.
NEUT14|We all know this is that Scarlett Johansson film that's going to come out on July 9th in both Disney Plus and in theaters.
NEUT15|Cruella, that's another title going to be released May 28th in theaters and online, and both of the films are going to be available for an additional fee to Disney Plus subscribers.
NEUT16|So even if you have the service.
BULL17|Not surprising you're gonna have to pay a little bit more money, but you will be able to enjoy the titles from the comfort of your home.
NEUT18|I think it's also worthwhile checking out the entire travel space today, because that is under a significant amount of pressure as Germany extends their closing as we get more news pouring out of other jurisdictions like Brazil having problems there, you can see in the upper right now Royal Caribbean.
BEAR19|That's down 6% Live Nation.
NEUT20|The The ticket company.
BEAR21|That's down 3% we can see.
NEUT22|Also United Airlines.
BEAR23|That's down nearly 7%.
NEUT24|So as Americans so.
NEUT25|Stay for the reopening trade.
BULL26|Overall Alexis.
NEUT27|Yeah, sort of that cascading effect there all right before we let you go gotta talk.
BEAR28|Oil looks like oil prices now in correction territory after another 6% drop.
BEAR29|That's right, and the losses keep on coming here.
BEAR30|Crude oil trade in the electronic market now down 6 1/2% and we can see haven't seen these prices in looks like over a month.
NEUT31|Let's take about 7 to 8 weeks here now we do have some support at various levels, but I think the key one that we just broke definitively because we settled below it is that 59 to $60.00 per barrel.
NEUT32|So focusing on that we also want to check out how energy stocks are doing.
BEAR33|They are still mired in the red and the losses now accelerating.
NEUT34|We did have Chevron I believe in the green.
BEAR35|Last time we talked about 30 minutes ago, it's now down 20 basis points.
BEAR36|Exxon off about 84 basis points, but the biggest losers of the day are these.
BEAR37|These foreign majors world Dutch Shell and BP each down nearly 5%.
BEAR38|Alright, thanks a lot, Jerrod, and we are near our lows of the day.
BEAR39|"The Dow Jones industrial average now down nearly 200 points, the S&P 500 off about 16 and the NASDAQ now down more than 90 points."""
