NEUT0|"""But that means only another hundred points left on your prediction."
NEUT1|So is it over?
NEUT2|You know we actually established those targets back in December when everyone thought we were headed to, you know, recession and zero, right?
NEUT3|Exactly?
BULL4|So blood pressure is relieved a little bit, and at this point I'd say the bias is maybe to take that up to higher levels if I would have said, you know above 3000 back then, I think they would have burned my house down.
BULL5|People were so grumpy, so we do think the backdrop is favorable.
NEUT6|The fundamentals are very favorable, so instead of three.
NEUT7|1000 potentially, where do we go?
NEUT8|Potentially, I think you know 3000 if you put a normal handle at 1616 and a half 17 times on 7% growth in earnings over the 2019 20 timeframe, it gets you to that 3000 and a little bit above.
NEUT9|So for multiples to lift a little bit in a low inflationary environment with these good fundamentals you could go to 3132 hundred comfortably I would think, but it's really about trend Tyler.
NEUT10|Get the trend and I'd say we're still there.
NEUT11|We're checking what do you see in the economy that either hardens you or worries you.
BULL12|Well, we think that the economy is going to recover from here.
NEUT13|First quarter 2019 will be the traffic global growth.
BULL14|We see it recovering from 3.2 to 3 1/2 which is going back to trend and we think it's the easing trial which is going to help which is essentially trade tensions, easing we have a China policy using an we have fled flexibility on policy approach.
NEUT15|So these three factors we think will drive that global recovery mind.
NEUT16|These were the three problems that we were facing in the fourth quarter of last year.
BULL17|And we have visibility now that all the three factors will actually support this recovery.
NEUT18|We will think that we think that this will be driven more by rest of the world than the US.
NEUT19|So the recovery and rest of the world is going to be even more prominent.
NEUT20|It will go from that rough of 3.3 to 3.9.
BULL21|That's a meaningful rebound that you should see in the global growth in parts of the world other than the US.
NEUT22|And so you see a change in the trade outlook as critical to that.
NEUT23|That means Europe, I assume, and China.
NEUT24|Yeah, it's essentially being from a demand perspective.
BULL25|Going to be driven by China, but from a policy perspective it is the US and China trade tensions that is a critical component of this story and we think that in China's case it's not just straight tensions easing that will help its recovery, but the stimulus that has been laid out by the government so far seems quite sizable.
NEUT26|It's 1.75% of GDP.
NEUT27|Or call it $250 billion.
BULL28|We think that's a sizable stimulus that will help recovery in China.
NEUT29|We should get that data confirming tomorrow.
BULL30|"China's recovery is actually taking hold in the month of March itself."""
