BULL0|"""Gold appears to have an emerging competitor in Bitcoin."
BULL1|Given the current price range for gold is likely that increased production will be a feature of 2021.
NEUT2|By contrast, Bitcoin has a tightly controlled supply based on the rules of mining Bitcoin.
NEUT3|Please be aware, fixed supply does not mean less volatility.
NEUT4|Indeed, it can mean the opposite.
BEAR5|When the supply is relatively inelastic, then the dynamics of shifting patterns with demand can have very large and abrupt impacts on prices.
BULL6|Bitcoin has illustrated this point.
BEAR7|We've also notice that goal may be losing its appeal as a hedge against global political risk in the 2017 to 2020.
NEUT8|The mostly ups and occasional downs of the gold price appeared to be directly tide to Fed policy shifts more than anything else.
BULL9|Since equities were responding to the same driving force, the gold equity relationship tended to become a little more closely associated.
BEAR10|Weakening.
BULL11|"Gold, Safe haven appeal."""
