NEUT0|"""Then there's the newly public J frog."
NEUT1|Think of them as a software developer, software developer.
NEUT2|J Frog came public a month ago.
NEUT3|I told you, wait for dipping, never really got one.
NEUT4|One of my favorite text analysts felt name is Sterling Audie AUTY over JP Morgan recently initiated coverage of J Frog with an overweight rating.
NEUT5|Anna $90.00.
NEUT6|Price target.
NEUT7|It's not 78.
NEUT8|So you got my blessing to start buying this one right now.
NEUT9|J Frog does sound like a character in a really bad reality show.
NEUT10|Which brings us to the top three most expensive.
NEUT11|White hots.
NEUT12|Red white hots in 3rd there's datadog.
NEUT13|Now Datadog is that application performance monitoring software outfit the stocks nearly tripled since the beginning of the year because it's a textbook covid play.
NEUT14|If you're going to embrace the cloud you have to make sure those cloud based programs actually work.
NEUT15|Datadog reports in three weeks, but the bars pretty high given that the stock trades at 44 times next year sales.
BEAR16|This is $112.00 stock that could plunge to 76 and still have a red hot valuation.
NEUT17|Don't be misled by its canine name.
NEUT18|This younger generation investors loves companion animals.
NEUT19|Maybe they think frogs.
NEUT20|Good camping animal.
NEUT21|Namaste.
NEUT22|Second most expensive is zoom video.
NEUT23|What can I say as I described, the top of the show?
NEUT24|This is the zoom economy.
NEUT25|People are using it.
BEAR26|I mean people are getting caught doing soon things they shouldn't even be thinking about.
BULL27|Sure, Trac a 52 times next year sales, but it's also got a nearly 300% growth wait for 2020.
NEUT28|How do you value a company that's taking over the world?
NEUT29|That's a tough one, right?
NEUT30|Taking over the World Times what sales I don't know.
NEUT31|I like Sumire, although you have to expect the brutal sell off at some point next year when it looks like a vaccine is within reach.
NEUT32|That's gonna be the next point.
NEUT33|If you got a huge game here.
NEUT34|Take some more put in houses, money.
NEUT35|Finally the hottest of the red hots.
NEUT36|Snowflake the cloud based data warehousing play.
NEUT37|This is melting the snowflake.
NEUT38|Snowflake came public with a bang last month, and while the stock hasn't done much, it still trades at 120 times this year.
NEUT39|Sales or 64 times.
NEUT40|Next year's numbers.
BULL41|Now the company's got a great business with triple digit revenue growth.
BEAR42|I think it's going to crush the numbers, but I think the reason the stocks traded sideways since the IPO.
NEUT43|Well, this is the upper limit of what people are willing to pay snowflakes at $247 stock.
NEUT44|This could be out.
NEUT45|This could be Shopify though.
BEAR46|It meaning that it could plummet to 144.
NEUT47|Trading North of 35 and then come right back.
NEUT48|But I doubt that that will happen, because it's perhaps the most user-friendly cloud analytics and business intelligence tool out there.
NEUT49|Go on the site or read through the examples and you'll understand how this thing has become out of nowhere in dispensable.
NEUT50|The bottom line, some of these red hot growth names are absolutely worth it into the sweetness, although if you're up huge, remember it is a sin to let it gain turn the loss.
NEUT51|I don't blame you for wanting to hang on, even if it is for dear life.
