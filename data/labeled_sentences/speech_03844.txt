NEUT0|"""Four years ago, SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son stormed into Britain and bought UK chip designer ARM Holdings in the country's biggest ever tech deal for $32 billion."
BULL1|Coming a week after the UK voted to leave the EU, the transaction was held by some politicians as an example of continued investor interest from international companies.
NEUT2|Despite Brexit, Mr Sun declared arm to be a crystal ball.
NEUT3|To guide him to make investments in everything, from artificial intelligence to the Internet of Things with arm under his control, the Japanese billionaire investor quickly convinced backers in Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi to pour 10s of billions of dollars into a new $100 billion fund called the Vision Fund, which would focus on startups.
NEUT4|But the investors only joined on the condition that a slice of arm was moved into the fund.
BEAR5|Four years later, Mr Sans Crystal Ball has yielded few results under Softbank's ownership.
BEAR6|ARM failed to thrive and the Vision Fund, which became known for a series of aggressive bets on startups including we work and Wag, hasn't turned out quite as he would have hoped.
BULL7|Meanwhile, other chip companies did much better than ARM.
NEUT8|One of those US based Invidia was worth only $30 billion.
NEUT9|When SoftBank acquired the UK company.
NEUT10|But by the time NVIDIA decided it was interested in buying ARM in the summer of 2020, its market value had surpassed 300 billion.
BULL11|By September, NVIDIA agreed to pay up to $40 billion for ARM.
NEUT12|It's not a done deal though.
BULL13|UK politicians are clamoring for commitments from NVIDIA to keep some of arms operations in Britain.
BEAR14|Longer term, the transaction will also require clearance from places such as China, which may look to scupper the deal as part of its ongoing spat with the US over sensitive technology.
NEUT15|For SoftBank, though, the crystal ball Appan, which Mr Sun had staked the company's future, is gone.
NEUT16|"The question is what comes next for soft Bank and its investors."""
