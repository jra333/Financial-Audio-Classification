NEUT0|"""Bullish calls in the gaming space today, Piper Sandler, initiating Penn National Gaming and DraftKings at overweight, alright, Pete."
NEUT1|I'm coming to you.
NEUT2|You own pen, calls you own DraftKings talk.
NEUT3|Talk to me.
NEUT4|Right, I own the pen calls just because I've used that more as a trading mechanism for me.
NEUT5|Scott, as opposed to the draft Kings where I've owned the stock for a really long period of time now, multiple months going back.
NEUT6|I think back to the spring spring months, but I think with pen the interesting thing is that obviously this whole leverage that they've got from Barstool.
NEUT7|I thought that investment was brilliant and opens up things for them.
NEUT8|They were, then they've been there early.
BULL9|They're going to continue to grow.
NEUT10|I think the growth is just started, and so because of that, this call makes a lot of sense.
BULL11|I think there's plenty of room to the upside.
NEUT12|I just view this one.
NEUT13|One more as a trade, and I view DraftKings, I think as as a stock that has a lot more potential upside, still still for itself just because of a lot of different reasons, but primarily because they were there first in sports, betting, betting an they're getting into I gaming and they're just exploding appan what they're doing with their database.
NEUT14|So I think for that reason that's why I preferred DraftKings at this point in time.
NEUT15|Wow, I'm coming to Jenny Pete because she has a bone to pick with you about this play.
NEUT16|She says, and I'm quoting from the note.
NEUT17|I'm called the notes you can't hide from the note.
BEAR18|I see low barriers to entry right for competition and valuations are unrealistic.
NEUT19|Jenny make your case to Pete.
BEAR20|In addition, despite the fact that users grew user profitability decline and it was actually and I am not a sports person, right but I know it was a really good quarter for sports.
NEUT21|Were like all the major things baseball, basketball, football all had their finals at the same time.
BULL22|So one would have thought that user profitability would have grown.
NEUT23|I was thinking that it's a lucky thing.
NEUT24|I smile a lot and have a cheery face for what a Debbie Downer.
BULL25|I am on so much.
NEUT26|Yeah, so we wouldn't touch this with a 10 foot pole Pete.
NEUT27|I'll give you the last word ranch.
NEUT28|Too rich, well, I think the reality is this, even though they're opportunities were there.
NEUT29|You point it, you point out the fact that they all these major sports, but think about all the sports that were getting cancelled at the same time and all the movement that was going on and all the disruption because of the virus and so forth.
NEUT30|So I think there's something to be said for that.
NEUT31|I think this would have been a better quarter for them if rather we were born in a normal period of time where we actually have the college and Pro Football season not getting interfered with all the rest of it.
BULL32|"So I understand what you're saying, but I still think that there early on they're the ones that are the leaders, and I think they're going to be the winners."""
