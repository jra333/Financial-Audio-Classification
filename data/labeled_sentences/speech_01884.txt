NEUT0|"""What's more exciting is this on 30th of March, Katie would the founder and CEO of Ark Invest actually listed?"
NEUT1|Now, if ten years ago, if you tell me about space exploration, you'd NASA.
NEUT2|I'll be in wow, that's exciting, but none of my business.
NEUT3|OK, so sorry for my ignorance, but if today if you tell me about space exploration, I'll be very, very exciting.
NEUT4|Why because of the.
BULL5|Recent technology improvement and of course we've, Jeff Bezos Elon Musk committed to bring people like us to explore space, which means that I have a chance to explore space and I'll be very exciting.
NEUT6|And what's more exciting is this.
NEUT7|On 30th of March, Katie would the founder and CEO of Arc Invest actually listed?
NEUT8|Are X ETF for us give us a chance to invest in space exploration companies?
NEUT9|Well this is very, very.
NEUT10|Exciting, healthy that yes on 30 of March onwards, you able to invest in companies that is related to space exploration, so these definitely not an April fool because, well, they actually something much now 'cause it broke.
NEUT11|Anyway, sorry for my little joke, so let me share more about these acts exactly.
NEUT12|A ETF focusing on space exploration.
NEUT13|So basically they invest into four different areas again.
NEUT14|So let me show you what is this.
NEUT15|Four different areas are, so the first one is actually orbital aerospace companies, psychologists, orbital aerospace companies and step one is actually the enabling technologies.
NEUT16|Companies are companies that enable those orbital and sorbital companies right?
NEUT17|Like for example, three depending artificial intelligence or robotics, the 4th area is aerospace beneficiary companies companies.
BULL18|There's actually benefited from these aerospace technologies right now.
NEUT19|This is very exciting, so if you actually look into the top three companies, OK invested by this RX, maybe the first one is Trimble, which actually invest 8.6% of the funding so Trimble is actually in GPS and of course.
NEUT20|Image Ng business and the second part Holdings in the 3D printing ETF.
NEUT21|So our tax I should invest into a EPL itself so it actually makes about 6% of their total RX portfolio and a third largest Holdings in Kratos defense security.
NEUT22|So Kratos is actually into a aerospace defense now.
NEUT23|Personally, I'm very, very excited, because if you are my student, you should already know by now that I'm not very interested in investing in.
NEUT24|Aircraft companies like for example.
NEUT25|Asia, or let's say for example SQ right?
NEUT26|But this is not aircraft.
NEUT27|These spacecraft is totally different, right?
NEUT28|Different opportunity out there.
NEUT29|Different potential out there.
NEUT30|And of course in terms of competition is also not a lot of competition so.
NEUT31|Show me your view right person.
NEUT32|Yeah, I'm very interested now.
NEUT33|I have not invested in RX OK just a disclaimer but I'm really looking into it and very very excited.
NEUT34|Very interested so maybe show me what's your view right?
NEUT35|Are you interested in RX right?
NEUT36|Would you consider putting this into your OK so show me your comment box and of course you feel that this exciting news should also let everyone knows about this.
