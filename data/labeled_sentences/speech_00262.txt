BULL0|"""The HR in today's trading session we see all three majors are higher now."
BEAR1|A stock that has been all over the place in the last couple of weeks, mostly down in the last couple of weeks is quantum scape.
NEUT2|Brian Sozzi, their CEO, joined the program a couple weeks ago.
NEUT3|We talked about the crazy move into stock.
BEAR4|It's almost been cut in half since then and I know you just got off the phone with the company CEO.
NEUT5|Yeah, that's right Miles so he not only joined our program, he also joined my iPhone.
BEAR6|That's Jagdeep Singh, literally about 5 minutes ago and I asked him, you know, the stock sold off or 41% yesterday.
NEUT7|Now he's telling me that there's been no change in business.
NEUT8|Everything the company has discussed with investors remains the same.
BULL9|I put out that tweet and now Quantum scape shares are up 12%.
NEUT10|The news where there was disappear to be some confusion they filed in South one on December 31st in the market interpreted that as they are selling new shares now they put out a clarification on this today on their website.
NEUT11|You're not selling new shares.
NEUT12|Essentially what they did and I'm just right off the PowerPoint.
NEUT13|They filed a resell S1 and the purpose of this was to permit the resale of shares that will already issued, or that may be issued on the exercise of options and warrants that already issued.
NEUT14|So again, no new shares being issued despite that's what the market interpreted initially when this one was filed.
NEUT15|No change in business.
BEAR16|Now saying does tells me he hates quotes, hates to see that type of market reaction yesterday, but again, he remains very focused on getting his bad battery technology.
BULL17|Ro tested and moving forward very much in line with what we just talked him a couple weeks ago.
NEUT18|Yeah, I mean look this thing was a spec so it came public at 10 bucks a share.
BULL19|It still up five X from there.
NEUT20|Who would fault them for going out to market to issue a little more stock even though they're not doing that again when your stock is up that much?
NEUT21|That's that's sort of the whole point of being a public company is you get to use that liquidity to then build your capital base, but certainly in stock will be following.
NEUT22|Real World, one thing to remind investors here in viewers guys is that this is what could happen in the months ahead with a lot of these facts.
BEAR23|These these stocks have gone through the roof.
NEUT24|You want to be in SharePoint models you might see a lot more.
NEUT25|You might see secondary offerings as these companies tries to raise even more capital to achieve their goals.
BEAR26|And considering they don't have revenues they don't have profits for a couple years you can see large swings in these stocks in the months ahead.
NEUT27|Look, the textbook will tell you that you should.
NEUT28|You should expect to see that that's what any sensible company would do when they see their stock.
BULL29|"Appreciate that much."""
