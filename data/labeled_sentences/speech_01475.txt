NEUT0|"""Alright well hi everybody its David Keenan with base camp trading and it's the free video for Friday, May 3rd 2019."
NEUT1|So a little bit of Berkshire Hathaway magic.
NEUT2|And goes a long way.
BEAR3|So if you see Amazon prior to today's move, Amazon had been actually in a relatively tight consolidation, giving you a head and shoulders reversal pattern with falling momentum, and we were actually watching Amazon break below this MQ power line and just staying week the rest of the afternoon on a normal day.
NEUT4|This can.
NEUT5|This is a continuation pattern.
BEAR6|Potentially to the downside, and that's what we were watching for, is a continuation move on this Fibonacci retracement, at least down to 16 eighteen 70 now.
NEUT7|Instead, what we have is actually a 3% plus gain today, so the rumor is, and Warren Buffett came out and said, yes.
NEUT8|One of the sub managers for Berkshire Hathaway is actually adding some Amazon stock to the portfolio.
NEUT9|So we just want to let you know 'cause it's going to show up in our SEC report at the end of the quarter.
NEUT10|Well, you know the headline is Berkshire Hathaway buying Amazon shares Zero?
BULL11|Amazon jumps 3% today and is managing to hold those gains at least today, putting in a new all time high.
BULL12|So All in all, Amazon is pushed up, whether artificially or not, or it's boosted because of this.
BULL13|News report and it's a nice jump we'll see next week if we can sustain above this 1950 level.
NEUT14|If it doesn't, I'd look for Amazon to pull back and at least fill that gap and then think about which direction we're going to go in.
NEUT15|But again, one day, little bit of Berkshire Hathaway Magic and you're up.
BULL16|"3%, thanks."""
