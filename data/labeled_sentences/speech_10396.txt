NEUT0|"""Get your CBC headquarters."
NEUT1|Jim Kramer joins us now.
BULL2|Good to see you Jim the some of the risks.
NEUT3|The trades are not looking too good today.
NEUT4|I don't know if that's not interest.
NEUT5|Rates.
NEUT6|You see Tesla Gemini?
NEUT7|I'm wondering Tesla is representative of all the new Age thinking and everything else, but they also did, you know, take a big stake in Bitcoin and Bitcoin's down is is this part of the same thing?
NEUT8|Is it on their balance sheet?
BEAR9|Does it hurt the company at this point?
BEAR10|I think that there's a nailes involving.
NEUT11|Bitcoin involved in Ark.
NEUT12|The excellent Fund group involving Tesla involving this packs where there is money coming out from everywhere involving what I would say is series of negative statements that we get about about the macro every day.
NEUT13|Saying that the Fed is doesn't understand the Boomer having it all comes together with a lot of the younger investors.
NEUT14|Just saying, I know, good grief.
NEUT15|I've had enough they do.
NEUT16|I mean, even oil down today there isn't anything that's working.
NEUT17|And then you've got the possibility that you have companies in America being sanctioned by the Chinese Foreign Ministry because they're speaking up about minority rights.
NEUT18|So there's no place to hide right now.
NEUT19|We we seem to think that it's value versus growth.
NEUT20|I don't think it's that at all.
NEUT21|It's like which companies are going to put bigger earnings surprises.
BEAR22|And the companies that report bigger earnings surprises.
NEUT23|Those are not the ones that younger investors care bout 'cause they don't understand the terminology they were doing.
NEUT24|Great show for full year, literally for a full year beginning this week last year, but now a lot of their things that they like or not coming together.
BULL25|Don't forget that we haven't talked about GameStop but that that was an amazing quarter.
NEUT26|Went down anyway.
NEUT27|Yeah, it's worded.
NEUT28|It went down is A is an understatement but we do.
NEUT29|Take for granted a lot of these are big moves and a lot of those widely held widely held.
NEUT30|Things that we talk about is it.
NEUT31|Is it telling us anything is that it is it.
BEAR32|Things wavering.
NEUT33|You think Jim in the overall market or that's pretty solid.
BEAR34|But I think that there is a bit of a give up going on in part of the market where I think there are a lot of people who felt that there would be stimulus checks coming into the market.
NEUT35|And it is interesting that right about now Robin Hood files to come public in yet and we discover of course is just an app is they've been saying, but it's precisely when that cohort seems to just said, you know what I've had enough.
BEAR36|I'm tired of losing money.
NEUT37|So Get Me Out and I think that has to happen.
NEUT38|This is that five stages of grief.
BEAR39|They are in the depressed phase and the acceptance means I gotta go and they're not going to go in and start buying the stock a deer that's doesn't excite them.
NEUT40|They want quantum scape and quantum scape senses that and wants to offer stocks.
NEUT41|So right now it looks like there's lots of stock being offered.
NEUT42|There's not a lot of demand.
NEUT43|And Joe yeah, Tesla is Bitcoin which is non fungible.
NEUT44|Tokens which is alchemy, which is whatever we want to call it, and.
NEUT45|You and I've been around, you know what we see these things.
NEUT46|We just say, well, I hope it isn't sayonara.
NEUT47|I hope you have some stocks they like, you know like J&J or something, you know.
NEUT48|Couple that I want that one in FT of the big O where he's like 8 feet off the ground in his legs are totally like this and he's got the basketballs down like it's still 6 feet off the ground.
NEUT49|I want that NFT just being from Cincinnati and in a BearCat thing.
BEAR50|Well I looked at the put a bit in there for the is God dead crypto you know the single page and I put in for Ethereum which they would make it hard and I end up missing by double I mean I could but all I can tell you Joe is is that there is a level of despair going on that is not in keeping with the Dow Jones industrial average.
BULL51|Right, alright, Jim, thanks we came here early.
NEUT52|Appreciate it.
NEUT53|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT54|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
