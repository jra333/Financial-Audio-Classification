NEUT0|"""But Jim, the vaccine is coming, and you know you're in an age group where I would think you get it sooner than May, so that's what I thought that's the case."
NEUT1|I thought that was true, but 90% number is a great number and we can see what Moderna tells us and we can see what we get from some of the other trials as well.
NEUT2|They were going to be vaccines, you know.
NEUT3|The fact is, it's not that hard to be immune from this we know that because there are so many people who have it don't even know they have it went out of five in New York and so modest changes in antibody levels do seem to have a significant impact.
NEUT4|On the virus, but they're trying to figure out and it's just a matter of waiting, but hanging on but.
NEUT5|But Carl, I think that the big issue again, I come back to Washington.
NEUT6|The issue is they don't know whether to give it to super spreaders first, which are younger people or to people who are more at risk and we don't have a plan about which one to give it to.
NEUT7|So when you go to various, I've gotten various doctors telling me various you're not in Jim, you're not in the Super Spreader section.
NEUT8|Oh Jim, you're going to be early in line, and that's why I've come back to think, you know, it's a may issue, but I think that what it really matters for.
NEUT9|The stock market is.
BULL10|You had some momentum coming.
NEUT11|You had Southwest starting to say good things.
NEUT12|You had a Disney meeting where I thought that we were going to hear good things.
BEAR13|Disney is going down ahead of the good meeting, so I'm beginning to worry that there are companies that really had your had their hopes up.
NEUT14|And their hopes are dashed, but there's nothing replacing it until this amorphous may.
BEAR15|Southway, referring to these comments out of Southwest today that they have seen some of the booking strength lose Steam in recent weeks, they do point out Jim, it's hard to distill it from the seasonal patterns.
NEUT16|Is it related to the spike in covid cases?
NEUT17|Even the company doesn't know, but I see what you're saying, right?
NEUT18|I mean Phil about talking about the race to go to Florida, like my wife who's moving to Florida.
NEUT19|3 order to avoid the virus.
BULL20|Yes, wow OK yeah, air BNB.
BULL21|Well, the air BNB has benefited from this.
NEUT22|It didn't appear that that would be the case initially and they're going to come up with a plan you want.
NEUT23|You want to be sitting there going to start.
NEUT24|Yeah, started Roadshow very soon.
NEUT25|That's going to be the best thing you between now and your end I think.
NEUT26|So yes, because Air B&B was supposed to call in March, people are thinking Airbnb.
NEUT27|We did.
BEAR28|Brian Chesky did those big layoffs.
BEAR29|Yeah, it looked and looked like the value the company had been impaired because nobody was going anywhere.
NEUT30|Nobody was traveling obviously, but then it ended up being that people want to stay somewhere that they can have full control over and not share with anybody, right?
NEUT31|They don't want to share.
NEUT32|They don't want people coming into the room.
NEUT33|People hate elevators.
NEUT34|There's like a car.
NEUT35|There's a pathological fear of elevators.
NEUT36|And until every element it when you laugh about just it's a funny line.
NEUT37|But what am I like?
BULL38|Anything logical, fear of elephant just I just flew in from LA and Boy my arms tired though yeah no no take my wife notices doing pretty good.
NEUT39|Take your wife your wife's going to Florida.
NEUT40|Anyway she's going to Florida because she doesn't want to.
NEUT41|Doesn't want the infection.
NEUT42|I know Florida's got a ton of it but I'm just saying that where it's warmer there is a sense that you can go outside more and what we've seen Quarles is that there are a lot of people barbecuing.
NEUT43|I had Clorox on recently.
NEUT44|It was like a Kingsford fall, but it's getting chilly and it's nasty out and I just think that what happens is you tend to do things indoors and then when you do that, we've got to go back to the Clorox economy.
NEUT45|The other side, not the kingsford's, but the Clorox wipes of which do not using your face.
BEAR46|I made that mistake yesterday.
NEUT47|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT48|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
