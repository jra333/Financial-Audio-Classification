NEUT0|"""It's very interesting."
NEUT1|Here is one that is the conundrum.
BEAR2|So Caterpillar in the Dell is down 6 now, is it down 6 because by may not win and so therefore China doesn't love us.
NEUT3|Remember that we were version of policy to China because Biden is part of the old hands in China.
NEUT4|Or is it because people don't feel the beat?
NEUT5|A big infrastructure bill?
NEUT6|Or is it both?
BEAR7|When you see a stock down that much, I think it's both.
NEUT8|I cannot believe the caterpillars just was Caterpillar somehow?
NEUT9|Abidance talk.
NEUT10|Wouldn't that be something?
NEUT11|Well, I guess your point infrastructure, right right?
NEUT12|You gotta assume again, let's even if Biden wins the presidency with the Senate staying Republican, the likelihood of a big infrastructure bill.
NEUT13|I mean, you never know obviously how these things are going to turn out.
NEUT14|You never know if Biden is.
NEUT15|If he is elected is going to be able to turn some people to his point of view, but it seems unlikely.
NEUT16|Unlikely.
NEUT17|Now remember there are twenty Republican senators who feel like many people come on air coral, which is that it's a V economy.
NEUT18|What are we worried about?
NEUT19|And Cove is going to be under control by the first quarter, and that is, by the way, a totally legitimate view.
NEUT20|If you're listening to some of the major drug companies.
NEUT21|Because if we do get a vaccine and we reopen America, we don't need to do infrastructure because we're going to be on fire and travel is going to happen again.
NEUT22|Look at.
NEUT23|It's not.
NEUT24|There are some belief that the Nazis are coming out at all.
NEUT25|I had to take cry have company on last night Thermo Fisher.
NEUT26|They make these machines.
NEUT27|They are testing 100,000,000 people.
NEUT28|We know and they make these machines that can test 8000 people day and they've got their pumping these machines out.
NEUT29|I have now figured out why I'm going to Super Bowl with without the Eagles.
NEUT30|Of course Eagles have to have a winning record I think to be in the Super Bowl but they will be able to have a covid free Super Bowl because these PCR tests.
NEUT31|I think they'll be able to make him in a small window maybe.
NEUT32|15 minutes that could only happen and they can produce enough to be able to have it so that 80,000 people are processed in the morning.
NEUT33|The my prediction the Super Bowl will be covid free.
NEUT34|It'll be just like the way it used to be because of Thermo Fisher's machines and the science that they've done.
NEUT35|David, I know you want therapeutics.
BULL36|I think that Thermo Fisher being able to to test test test is remarkable and is not appreciated nearly enough by the public.
NEUT37|You had Mark Asper on right?
NEUT38|Yes, you always like Mark Casper.
NEUT39|He's very inquisitive fellow.
NEUT40|Yes, they do deals, but as we pointed out yesterday, of course, that's the letter it is.
BULL41|Thank you, guys.
NEUT42|They know in the control of my love that chart wow.
NEUT43|'cause that's just what did you go back in further?
NEUT44|I mean the numbers are even more.
BULL45|Youth pointed at 10 times the return of the S&P fifteen 1500% versus 130%.
NEUT46|And that's without the dividends according to what they're doing with the PCR test is not known by people.
NEUT47|OK, I they were really breaking the story on my show.
NEUT48|This is they're ready to make it so that if you want to test a college.
NEUT49|Boom, you test the concept that and if it turns out that there are few people who need it, they can isolate.
NEUT50|It is just think they are going to figure out how to make it so we can go back to work and they're too expensive.
NEUT51|By PCR, I mean I'd buy a PCR for my restaurant so it didn't wipe out all my profit for the next 10 years.
NEUT52|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT53|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
