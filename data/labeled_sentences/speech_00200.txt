BULL0|"""Yes, I have to go with the 16 sent earnings beat."
BULL1|Organic revenue also coming in very strong.
BULL2|That's sort of a good raw look at the business up 4%.
BULL3|The expectation was 1 to 2% and it was really across the board.
BULL4|It was Frito lay that grew 6%.
BULL5|Quaker more people eating breakfast at home also growing 6% and beverages.
BULL6|A nice surprise there up 3% versus an expectation of around one.
NEUT7|The other highlight I would I would mention here is that the company issued guidance for the first time since the pandemic in February so they clearly have some visibility.
BULL8|And it came in better than expected as well.
NEUT9|Joining us now is PepsiCo CFO and Vice Chair Hugh Johnston.
BULL10|As always good to have you here to talk about the quarter human.
NEUT11|How much of this good morning?
BEAR12|How much of this has to do with the fact that people are just spending more time at home and they're still sort of panic buying and that's really lifted results across the food space right now.
NEUT13|Yeah, it candidly for us, so I think not not that much.
NEUT14|Perhaps a little bit in the Quaker business, but I think what we see in the in the snacking business as well as in the beverage businesses.
BULL15|Consumers have returned to big brands in a pretty substantive way and what they're finding is they return.
NEUT16|Is they really like the products they like?
NEUT17|The quality?
NEUT18|They like, the innovation they like all the flavors and as a result they are leaning into our portfolio.
NEUT19|Yet one of the things that's been interesting is consumers sort of evolving their behavior over over the course of time and what we're seeing now is mobility is increase.
BEAR20|We're also seeing away from home.
BULL21|Eating is increasing a little bit, but it's been stable for awhile.
BULL22|I think consumers have adapted to the this obviously difficult situation with the pandemic and they found new stable behaviors, and our categories tend to be pretty resilient with those behaviors.
NEUT23|I mentioned that you gave guidance for the first time since back in February.
NEUT24|It seems like the picture is not clear.
BEAR25|There are a lot of warnings about a second wave and rising cases in this country.
NEUT26|There are questions about whether we will see more stimulus, what gives you the confidence to see out to project guidance that comes in at a sales rate that was equivalent to last year pre pandemic.
BULL27|Yeah, so we have pretty good visibility into the next quarter where we're not ready to talk about 2021 yet of course, but at least for the next quarter we really do.
BULL28|Feel like we've got a good line aside, and as I mentioned, I think it's that these new consumer behaviors have gotten pretty stable and as a result of that, we as we look at our business, we feel like we can give investors a reasonable level of confidence over the next 90 days around what we expect to deliver the both the food business and a snack business, or performing in a in a stable way.
NEUT29|In addition to that, a lot of the things that we've been doing in the business around innovating around, executing in the marketplace, all of that stuff seems to be.
BULL30|Helping us perform well.
BULL31|We're gaining share both in stacks and beverages in about 3/4 of our top 20 markets, so we feel like we've got good momentum in the business right now.
NEUT32|Wanted to zero in on the beverage business because that that comes as a big surprise, at least to analysts.
BULL33|The 3% growth.
BULL34|I feel like Coke still gets credit for improved execution.
NEUT35|What are you doing on that front and where within that beverage business are you growing shares?
NEUT36|It's still in the hot new brands like Bubbly.
NEUT37|It's really both.
NEUT38|If you look at how our business is operating right now within North America, Beverages Gatorade grew high single digits Mountain Dew, which had been a bit of a hot spot for his Mountain Dew Group.
BULL39|Mid single digits primarily behind Mountain Dew 0, which is a phenomenal new product and even Pepsi is is up low single digits, so we see broad based strength and a lot of that is because as we put a new organization structure into our field last year, it's really performing at a top top level right now.
