NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Now as a quick reference point here for Amazon, earnings have went out and as of right now, as of the exact recording of this video, the price is actually down around 3165, so where a where is it going to actually open up?
NEUT5|That's always you know anyone's guess because we sell a pool of after hours and then we all of have all of premarket on Friday.
NEUT6|But my goal here is to just to illustrate some general ideas and areas that look like could come into play and that you're going to want to keep a close eye on, and the level that is very much so in play right now, in which is a very historic level of support.
BEAR7|Down here at the 3140 Mark again.
NEUT8|As of now you can see it's actually at 3154, so it's not quite there yet.
NEUT9|But like I said it very well could be come into play.
NEUT10|In 3140 is significant is if you go through the history of the sharp.
NEUT11|I mean it has been a long time since the price of been down around that area, let alone down below it.
NEUT12|So that'll be one key level to watch in the event that level does not quite hold up, then the next key area of support to watch very closely with then be around 3125.
NEUT13|So 3140 thirty 125 couple of areas of support that look like could be coming into play.
NEUT14|Now, to be fair though, maybe this thing all of a sudden decide to turn itself around in either after hours or premarket tomorrow.
NEUT15|And you know, maybe at that point some of these levels would be coming back into play.
NEUT16|So one key level of resistance now being right there at the 3175 mark, or if the price can get up through the 3175 mark.
NEUT17|Next level after that would then be up there around the 3210 area.
NEUT18|So keep an eye on these general areas.
BULL19|It's looking like the price is going to open up somewhere within this range, so depending on where it opens up, these lines will still be more than valid and more than helpful.
NEUT20|So we just want to keep an eye on him.
BULL21|But yeah, Friday is definitely going to be very entertaining day.
NEUT22|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT23|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT24|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL25|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT26|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT27|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR28|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT29|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT30|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT31|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT32|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT33|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
