NEUT0|"""Hello everyone analyst success to any 2nd of December 2020."
BEAR1|Time is 10 to 3:00 PM UK time 3 hour chart Amazon I saw on Tradingview people were publishing sorry ideas that there is a triangle and the market will break and go up.
NEUT2|That might be correct but there are something that we might have a very scenario as well which is very strong so the bullish scenario what people consider is that we are having ABCD.
NEUT3|E and then we break the D level which will go all the way up and the trade suggestions setup is when we break this level.
NEUT4|3369 there should be a buyer.
NEUT5|This might be correct, but not very correct in my opinion.
NEUT6|And there is a reason I will explain.
NEUT7|First of all, this is impulsive, so we have an impulsive wave here.
BEAR8|This is impulsive and triangle.
NEUT9|Most of the ways have to be zigzag, not impulsive wave.
NEUT10|So other scenario could be that we might have a downtrend scenario having a BC OK, this is also a possibility.
NEUT11|If we consider the downtrend scenario, this structure here might be a triangle or call.
NEUT12|Could be might be series of 1212 if we want to consider air triangle we have to say this is ABC and the Wave C from the feeble voice.
NEUT13|It's making sense 61.8% of the wave A and we have as exact.
NEUT14|We have a correction and then DE an all the way down OK?
NEUT15|The wave they might not have finished yet because this is impulsive, so for the downtrend scenario what I like to see, probably we have 123.
NEUT16|We might have a wave E and then we should go all the way down South.
NEUT17|This is also a possibility, so make sure if you want to buy the market.
NEUT18|This doesn't seem of a like a triangle to buy the market.
NEUT19|If you want to be a buyer it could be a different structure.
NEUT20|So be a little bit careful before placing a buy order in Amazon.
BULL21|"Thanks for watching and have a good day."""
