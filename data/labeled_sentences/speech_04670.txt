NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Mark Gordon, the chief market strategist for goldenticker.com, and we're going to take a look at Apple here and we know that Apple is putting in a Cup."
NEUT1|Shape here.
NEUT2|And a handle which is a very bullish formation and we see here at the top of the Cup of the handle is 9683.
NEUT3|So the buy point is 9690 three $0.10 above it as it comes through that price on volume.
NEUT4|So let's look at the earnings.
BULL5|The earnings were up 75% in December.
BEAR6|For the closed December quarter versus December 05 quarter and 68% for September and 46% for June.
BULL7|So this is a very strong earner.
NEUT8|The earnings per share growth rate yearly is 90% and the return on equity is 23%.
BULL9|These are all really good numbers, which clearly makes us a cancel in stock.
NEUT10|Next thing we want to look at is the 50 day moving average.
NEUT11|This dark blue line here, which is moving up and has been.
NEUT12|Very stable then we want to look at this relative strength line.
NEUT13|This kind of squiggly, lighter Gray line and we see the previous high over here when the cut made it's high and we see that it's trying to get into new high ground.
BULL14|It's pretty close.
BULL15|So we'd ideally like to see this line move up as the stock comes out of the handle and starts breaking the top of the handle.
NEUT16|So we'll look for that next thing we'll look at is the volume.
BULL17|We see that the volume is very quiet here in the handle area, which is a good sign.
NEUT18|That means the stocks taking a rest.
NEUT19|It built the right side of the Cup here and is now as it approached the top of the left side of the Cup.
NEUT20|Before breaking out, it's now taking a pause and this is an indication that the stock might be resting here, shaking out the last of the week holders.
NEUT21|Worrying about if you will and then it's going to stage a move, hopefully on on big volume as it crosses out and we'll be looking for that and jump on this stock.
NEUT22|If it does OK, good luck.
NEUT23|"Let's so let's watch Apple and see what happens."""
