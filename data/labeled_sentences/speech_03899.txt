BULL0|"""Hey guys, welcome back to another video today."
NEUT1|We were talking about how I find the stocks that I buy.
NEUT2|So if you're new here make sure you leave a like subscribe and hit the Bell so you don't miss any of my videos.
NEUT3|Let's get started.
NEUT4|There are two types of trading that I primarily do.
NEUT5|The first one is day trading or I buy and sell a stock in one day for hope of profit.
NEUT6|The other type of trading I do is swing trading.
NEUT7|Swing trading is where I buy a stock and hold it for longer than a day.
NEUT8|Ideally I'll buy it and sell it in less than a week for profit.
NEUT9|Most of the time I just hold my swing trades for a few days or just overnight.
NEUT10|The reason I'm telling you this is because I find my stocks differently for swing trading and a trading for date charity, I like to use a stock chat called Hyper Stocks and this chat there are over 200 members that are talking about stocks and stocks that look good by the owner of the chat is a professional stock investor that is amazing at what he does.
NEUT11|He sends out a weekly watchlist telling us what stocks look good for day trading and even swing trading.
NEUT12|He then explains why you picked the stock, what the chart is telling us about the stock and gives us pointers when to buy it and sell it.
NEUT13|This child has taught me the most about stocks out of any other resources I've ever seen.
BULL14|I've been able to grow my account by 1000% in the last four months by primarily using this chat.
NEUT15|If you guys are interested and want to check out this hyper chat, I'll leave a link down in the description.
NEUT16|The other resource to find my day trades if I'm not using the hyper chat is actually Twitter.
NEUT17|Twitter is surprisingly great for finding news about stocks.
NEUT18|If you're an authentic pages that tell real news about certain stocks and companies, I use Twitter to find news about the stocks that I own or I'm looking today.
NEUT19|Trade.
NEUT20|You may figure out from Twitter that.
BULL21|The stock has vaccine trials and it's doing really good from that.
BULL22|In the stock prices going up.
BULL23|Or maybe it had great earnings and the stock price is getting affected positively, but please not using this method is very risky.
NEUT24|Whenever finding stocks today trade for example, I found a stock on Twitter and bought it and the ticker symbol is BM NT.
NEUT25|I then bought the stock at $0.33 at 10,000 shares at 11:00 AM.
NEUT26|The reason I bought this is because there's news about CEO meanings that could affect the stock positively.
NEUT27|Hey there, this is future Laiho and.
NEUT28|While editing this video, I realized I didn't film the part talking about the stock vehement Ian.
NEUT29|What happened with it?
NEUT30|So just to do a quick recap, I bought the stock at $0.33 for 10,000 shares at 11:00 PM because it's getting hyped up for a CEO meeting.
NEUT31|I'd then sold it 3 hours later at 2:00 PM at $0.46 and made about $1300 and only three hours.
BULL32|That is the most I've ever made in one day, and I was very thankful for that right after I sold the stock, it went down quite a bit, so Luckily I sold at the perfect time.
BULL33|It made one point 3K in three hours.
NEUT34|That's why you have to be very careful where you buy and sell those types of stocks.
NEUT35|So those are the main resources I find to use day trading.
NEUT36|Now I'm going to tell you how I find my swing trade slash long term traits.
NEUT37|If I'm not using hyper stocks it by my swing trades, I'll use Yahoo Finance and Motley Fool.
NEUT38|There I find catalyst about the stock and news about the stock and sector that it's in and if it looks positive for the future.
NEUT39|These websites are great because it shows the top stocks that have a great looking future.
NEUT40|So in this video I shared with you guys how I find my day trading and swing trading stocks.
NEUT41|Hey you up there, you're right this video.
