NEUT5|As you can see here in the middle of this chart, the watermark is then asked about the ticker timeframe.
NEUT6|W stands for quickly and this is the name of the stock which is Berkshire Hathaway.
BULL7|So all time highs has been brought up in broken as explained in the video at the de few months ago, when breath was around there were expecting price to rally.
NEUT8|And that's exactly what has happened at the time.
NEUT9|I remember that some members in the certificate.com trading community they were telling or someone share and paused.
NEUT10|Uh, news, something telling that Berkshire Hathaway?
NEUT11|This was coronavirus and all that they had sort of.
BEAR12|Sold the thousands and hundreds of thousands of shares of Coca Cola and many others viewed also many airlines and all that because of the coronavirus and they had to lose a lot of money.
NEUT13|Well, you could have thought OK, actually.
BEAR14|Otherwise going to continue dropping.
NEUT15|No, it didn't.
NEUT16|Why?
BULL17|Because we have a strong balance.

BEAR25|Because the all time highs are being broken a lot very strongly.
NEUT26|This one did this one will it?
NEUT27|I don't know, but what I can tell you is that it is a strong balance and this is not support or resistance.
NEUT28|In this case, support nothing to do with that many rules that will tell you how to identify these imbalances or why they're good to go while they're not good to go and all that.

NEUT36|Very strategies and allow directional trading works and I can prove that so.
NEUT37|Long bias only if you're using spreads you're using selling puts whatever you're doing.
