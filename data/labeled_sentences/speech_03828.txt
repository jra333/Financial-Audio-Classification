NEUT0|"""Games early I'm joined by Joe Maker."
NEUT1|We're here to answer one of your questions via an Ask a Fool video series.
NEUT2|Today's question comes over Facebook from another guy named James I like that already.
NEUT3|James asks what is the average amount of time doing research Uncle Joe Mega ran James early spend on a stock.
NEUT4|I would like to know how long a professional spins before making a decision.
NEUT5|Now I just have to ask Uncle Joe Meggers there's something here that I don't know about you.
NEUT6|That's a nickname from Market Flori.
NEUT7|At some point Bill Man refer to me as Uncle Joe because I was curmudgeonly.
NEUT8|Do you do like that?
NEUT9|Do you like that name?
BEAR10|My wife hates it.
NEUT11|Your wife face it, OK, but what about you?
NEUT12|What about you?
BULL13|I'm just OK gotcha.
NEUT14|OK, So what do we say to James?
NEUT15|Yeah, so I just throw darts, but that doesn't always work.
NEUT16|So a lot of the time I put it like this.
NEUT17|Is that the longer you've spent investing, the less time you need?
NEUT18|On each new idea, so you look at someone like Warren Buffett.
NEUT19|He can very decisively move in with a lot of cash and say I'm going to invest in this distressed bank, but that's because he's been looking at this bank off and on for 50 years.
NEUT20|Literally, if you are looking at a company for the first time, you're going to need to spend more time on that.
NEUT21|But the nice thing is, the more time you spend in the market, the less time you need.
NEUT22|So true, and that's basically my thinking.
NEUT23|Exactly 2 and Joan.
NEUT24|I have fairly similar approaches sometimes.
NEUT25|James it's maybe there's not enough days.
NEUT26|In a month, we're just cranking through stocks and you value something you hope it's going to come out.
NEUT27|Well, it doesn't.
NEUT28|Over and over and over.
NEUT29|Other days I've got this rolodex of names in my head.
NEUT30|I know what will make me like a certain stock that happens.
NEUT31|So Boom is just today.
NEUT32|It really varies, but we do have that sort of bench of years of knowledge spending on these stocks and we also have analyst to help us too, so it's kind of all over the map.
NEUT33|The main thing is just getting the stock down right?
NEUT34|Yeah and I think one thing, we're big fans, big fans up here is using watch list.
NEUT35|So when I started at the pool I was amazed that a lot of guidance like James Billman have these huge mental rolodex is of companies you know.
NEUT36|And there's.
NEUT37|An idea for every type of theme or macro situation, different degrees of leverage within all of those, and so that's the kind of thing that just comes with experience.
NEUT38|But a great way to start working towards that is to start putting together like an Excel spreadsheet with your favorite companies in terms of like competitive Advantage products that you love and just watching them overtime and you get to know them better.
NEUT39|An as they get cheap or do something really well that you're excited about.
NEUT40|You'll be more ready to pounce when the time comes.
NEUT41|James will hope that answers your question.
