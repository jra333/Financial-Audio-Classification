NEUT0|"""Hello everybody and welcome to this lesson of building dynamic charts in Google Sheets using the data validation method."
NEUT1|So let's just see what we have in the sheets already.
NEUT2|I have a small table of raw data.
NEUT3|It shows 5 drivers and it shows their annual mileage in 2013 and 2014 and I'm going to use a data validation method to go ahead and create a dynamic table which we can then draw our charts off of and that makes the chart dynamic.
NEUT4|So let's see that in action.
NEUT5|It's it's a pretty straightforward process, so the first step is to just create this data validation cell so I come up here today to.
NEUT6|And I click validation.
NEUT7|Now my cell range is where I would like the validation to exist.
NEUT8|The criteria is the list that I want the user to be able to select from, so I'm going to click into that and I'm going to highlight the five names of the five drivers.
NEUT9|And then I'm going to just click save.
NEUT10|Everything else is fine in this case.
NEUT11|Now you see how it puts that little Gray triangle into myself.
NEUT12|So if I click on that grey triangle, it pops up with the name, the five names which allows the.
NEUT13|User of the spreadsheets can choose.
NEUT14|One of those names.
NEUT15|Now this is very powerful because I can now use this combined with the V lookup formula.
NEUT16|Look that onto that.
NEUT17|That column I can search in this table here block that table, turn column 2.
NEUT18|Thus.
NEUT19|And now I just return the third one third column.
NEUT20|And now when I change the name you see the values are changing their updating automatically, which is fantastic.
NEUT21|That's what we want to see, so let's just put some headings in here 2013, 2014.
NEUT22|OK, so I think we're ready to create our charts or dynamic charts, so I'm going to highlight that data.
NEUT23|Come up to insert.
NEUT24|Chart.
NEUT25|And.
NEUT26|Go to column chart.
NEUT27|Use groceries labels and.
NEUT28|Let's just customize it.
NEUT29|We're going to remove that title.
NEUT30|And we're also gonna remove on the left vertical.
NEUT31|Gonna remove that name because.
NEUT32|We don't want these names fixed.
NEUT33|Also, going to make sure we start at zero all the time, but let's insert the know.
NEUT34|The reason I did that because otherwise I would end up with the name Sam for example, always on the left and access and obviously.
NEUT35|At times this is going to not represent service will represent somebody else, but by leaving the legend there it tells me which name I'm referring to sleep.
NEUT36|You can see how that chart changes dynamically.
NEUT37|With the values that I select.
NEUT38|So it's a really handy technique to using the dashboards or reports to add that level of interactivity so that the user can select the metric they want to focus on and and see how that changes.
NEUT39|So that's all folks until next time.
BULL40|"Thanks again."""
