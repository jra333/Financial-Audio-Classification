NEUT0|"""So we have ticker ROT going public, taking Sarcos Robotics, a leader in mobile industrial robotic systems to enable the workforce of the future talking about productivity."
BULL1|So this is height of $220 million back by some pretty strong names.
NEUT2|We have Black Rock.
NEUT3|We have palantir.
NEUT4|We have Caterpillar schlumpberger jaws, a states capital.
NEUT5|You know, some decent names.
NEUT6|And then they also have a deal with Delta.
NEUT7|Airlines, so they're expecting to release their Guardian Exo full body, wearable industrial exo skeleton robot in mid 2022 and then you know more robots in the future.
BULL8|So again talking about productivity with these exoskeletons and this pack deal, helping to power the financials that they need.
NEUT9|But they're looking at all kinds of industries.
NEUT10|Aerospace, automotive, logistics, defense, oil and gas power and utilities.
NEUT11|Calling it $147 billion market just in the US.
BULL12|Alone, they're going to operate with a robotics as a service solution, you know, and they already have key strategic partners, including several Fortune 100 companies.
NEUT13|As I said, Delta Airlines you know highlighted in the announcement day, so this one you're going to have to wait a little bit for revenue, so revenue of $9 million this year in fiscal 2020, 122,000,000 in fiscal 2022.
NEUT14|And then we expand after that this deal valuing the company at $1.3 billion so.
