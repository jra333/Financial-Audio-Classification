NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame for.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, a very very nice day here for Amazon, especially when you factor in the context were just on Wednesday the price closed down here and then Thursday being over and the prices worked its way all the way up there.
NEUT5|So still more work needs to be done but you gotta give credit where credits do a nice recovery from, you know where it was just on you know a day ago.
NEUT6|So let's get some levels of support and resistance mapped out in the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a claim would make this chart look the absolute wrong is going forward and that would be the price can stay above 3210 not don't get me wrong if the price falls below 3210.
BEAR7|That does not mean that the entire Amazon chart has now been destroyed.
BULL8|All I'm saying in that is if the price can actually manage to stay above there, that would be a very very impressive sign of power going forward.
NEUT9|But as I've talked about past videos and actually let me squeeze things out just to bring it more in context here, but it's all about from the bigger picture that Purple line there, the 50.
NEUT10|Simple moving average, especially on this one.
NEUT11|I mean you have a perfect case study.
BULL12|Look how the price cruised very nicely above that level.
BULL13|Once again found support at it on Friday or excuse me on Wednesday and then today Thursday bounce off it.
NEUT14|So now going into Friday.
NEUT15|You know that has been just confirmed.
NEUT16|As you know, the general level that you're going to continue to watch moving forward, so again 3210 would be that preferable level.
NEUT17|But if the price doesn't quite hold above there again, not the end of the world, could you still do have that 50.
BULL18|Moving average, which as you know we can see as in a fantastic job of providing support as far as areas of resistance are concerned?
NEUT19|Gotta squeeze down the charter a little bit to offer up the next potential battleground here, and that next potential overall battleground right up there.
NEUT20|At let's see what is that?
NEUT21|The 3265 Mark, so 3265.
NEUT22|Generally speaking, next key.
NEUT23|Big Roadblock and big Battleground to keep an eye on very very closely.
NEUT24|So on, although the grind continues, the bounds continues and not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this breakout that occurred late day today?
NEUT25|Let's see what happens.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT28|But it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL30|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT35|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT39|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note.
