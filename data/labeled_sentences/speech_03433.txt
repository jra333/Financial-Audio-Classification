BEAR0|"""What's going on guys lottery stocks here today we're going over Gamestop's failure to deliver through hedge funds."
NEUT1|I'm going to break this down an example I seen earlier today.
NEUT2|It was over live stream on Andrew Momentis channel.
NEUT3|Go check him out.
NEUT4|He wasn't actually the speaker or the maker of this example.
NEUT5|It was someone in his stream.
NEUT6|I could not find the Youtubers name.
NEUT7|Otherwise I would give him credit, but I just thought this was super good breakdown of everything you should know with GameStop.
NEUT8|If you're a small investor and you don't fully understand it in plain English, this is an example.
NEUT9|Before I started this example, hit that subscribe button.
NEUT10|Also, retail traders do not own shares.
NEUT11|Keep that in mind.
NEUT12|Retail traders do own shares.
BEAR13|I'm sorry.
NEUT14|Keep that in mind.
NEUT15|Retail traders own shares, hedge funds they do not own shares.
NEUT16|Those are borrowed shares.
NEUT17|Now let's get into this example in this quick breakdown in plain English.
NEUT18|Gramma, OK, that's what we're using Grandma.
NEUT19|Needs 10 shares of McDonald's at $10 a share.
NEUT20|TTC says they will get them for no problem.
NEUT21|Let's let's get into this.
NEUT22|DTC says OK, Steven, we need those shares back that we let you borrow.
NEUT23|And he says, yeah, no problem.
NEUT24|Let me go get him from Jenn.
NEUT25|He then asked Jenn for the shares.
NEUT26|And Jenn says, Oh yeah, no problem.
NEUT27|I don't have him right now.
NEUT28|Let me go get mine from Dan that he owes me.
NEUT29|And then down the line.
NEUT30|This continues eventually, Dan says.
NEUT31|Sorry, I still need the shares right now.
NEUT32|I cannot give him back to you now.
NEUT33|Down this line.
NEUT34|At the end.
BEAR35|This causes a failure to deliver because there are no shares delivered back to the to the TTC.
NEUT36|An with this is one person, one default at the end.
NEUT37|Can break everyone elses accounts.
BEAR38|1020 hundreds of hedge funds however however money.
NEUT39|And then you get these people so.
BEAR40|Steve and Jen and Dan cannot give DTC their shares.
NEUT41|And they eventually say.
NEUT42|Oh man, we can't.
NEUT43|We don't have these shares to give the DTC.
NEUT44|We gotta go over to people who actually have AM US time and hands to holders of GameStop and AMC.
NEUT45|Then they say hey Diamond hands, how about we give you guys $11.00 a share and we take these shares off your hand.
BULL46|And US Diamond hands say Nah 2000 share maybe even 5000 is a good good price in my opinion.
NEUT47|You can pay that from me if you want.
NEUT48|So they buy him.
NEUT49|Other hedge funds see this.
NEUT50|And they try to buy at a cheaper price than another hedge fund and another had fun, another henchman.
NEUT51|They don't want Diamond hands to change their mind, and they don't want the price to be $1,000,000 a share.
NEUT52|This then creates a short squeeze.
NEUT53|Which is what we're about to see with GameStop, and that's why everyone is holding.
BULL54|This is huge and hope you guys enjoyed it in plain English.
