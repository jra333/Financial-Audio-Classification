BULL0|"""I think the consumer is in good shape at this point."
BEAR1|You know tariffs clearly are negative and will cut into consumer spending growth to some extent, but the labor market is quite strong right now and that's always the main source of income for consumers.
NEUT2|So that's their spending.
NEUT3|Power is the labor market that looks to be proceeding pretty well at this point.
BEAR4|Has the consumer worsened, though at all in the last six months?
BEAR5|There's been some Upson Downs key.
NEUT6|One was on the soft side.
NEUT7|I view that as more just regular cyclical ups and downs.
BULL8|I think the trend in consumer spending right now is somewhere in the two and 3/4 to 3% range, which is which is quite good.
BEAR9|You know we've got our last look at first quarter GDP today, still above the 3% level.
NEUT10|What happens to that number this quarter?
BEAR11|It's going to soften in Q2.
NEUT12|The tracking estimates that we have are somewhere in the 1 1/2% range.
BEAR13|At this point those will change, but it does look to be slowing down in Q2.
BEAR14|Again though, I think the trend in growth is somewhere between those two estimates.
NEUT15|We think we're.
NEUT16|Shifting down from a 3% economy into a 2 to 2 1/2 percent economy, do you think the Fed might be forced to move based on what the market is doing at the moment?
BULL17|And if it does, how much does that boost your forecast for the rest of the year?
NEUT18|It's certainly possible that happens.
NEUT19|It's not based on what we've seen so far.
NEUT20|You know the market still up for the year, the end, and I think the Fed really doesn't want to get in that position of responding to every market up and down by by with their policy.
BEAR21|But I think if we get into a situation where the markets really are seizing up.
BEAR22|Stocks are falling.
NEUT23|There's a lot of uncertainty.
NEUT24|That's the situation where the Fed may consider a cut at some point.
NEUT25|Just 'cause we don't talk to you that much.
NEUT26|What?
NEUT27|How different is your life now?
NEUT28|Working as an economist for Steve Cone instead of shop like Barclays most of the day today work is similar.
NEUT29|"The main difference is I'm not going out to see all kinds of clients outside the office."""
