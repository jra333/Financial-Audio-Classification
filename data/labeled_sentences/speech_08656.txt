NEUT0|"""So I sold a an IP today."
NEUT1|You can see it broke out right here around.
NEUT2|I'm not even sure what that is like 74 ish rant about 14%, so I'd like to take profits from like fourteen 1520% from where was breaking out.
NEUT3|So I actually took 83 and it hit 8333.
NEUT4|So I basically took out.
BEAR5|The top is starting to become overbought.
NEUT6|This thing could still run.
NEUT7|But I just wanted to cash out for I think after like 600 over $600 profit in a couple of days.
NEUT8|So that is why I sold the stock.
NEUT9|It still has room to run.
BULL10|I think it based out here for a long time, but the other stock I bought I thought looks a little bit better.
BULL11|So hopefully you guys bought this stock, made some money.
NEUT12|"Don't forget to sign up for Overwatch words in our stock alerts as well so that you could have had this one on the stock word and hopefully made money off of this alright?"""
