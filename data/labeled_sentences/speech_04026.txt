NEUT0|"""Another automaker story to get to next."
BULL1|Hyundai making a major about face when it comes to potential partnership with Apple, Josh Lipton Scott that pretty extraordinary story for us, Josh.
NEUT2|Yes, Sir, well this was a very surprising statement from Hyundai initially indicating that yes, it was an early stage talks here with Apple about potentially working on an electric car.
NEUT3|Lots of excitement.
NEUT4|The stock pops, but then kind of reversing course releasing a new statement, avoiding any mention of Apple at all now, and was telling me that you can't rule out a partnership between these two.
BEAR5|But comments like this, they say could certainly hurt Hyundai's chances of actually sealing any kind of deal because we know Apple.
NEUT6|Does not like talking about products in its pipeline.
NEUT7|Still, all this feels more speculation about Tim Cooks really ambitions here.
NEUT8|Reuters recently reported that Apple was moving forward with self driving car technology tarring, targeting a vehicle by 2024, but well known aplin's mean she quote says the market is too bullish on this idea.
NEUT9|Wouldn't be surprised if the car doesn't launch until 2028 or later.
NEUT10|Back to you all.
NEUT11|Josh.
BULL12|Thanks so much for that.
NEUT13|I mean human dies initial statement saying we understand there talking.
NEUT14|To global automakers, what what prompted them to release that if they didn't have permission to do so?
NEUT15|I wouldn't be.
NEUT16|You know, that would be a question will for Honda.
NEUT17|I think you might be best served to the company why they would put out that statement.
NEUT18|It was certainly very surprising because you know you're dealing with Apple.
NEUT19|Apple does not talk about products in its pipeline.
NEUT20|I was talking to Gene Munster over at Loop Ventures today and Jeans had listened.
NEUT21|There are advantages that there's reasons you do that.
BULL22|There's competitive advantages.
BULL23|There's marketing advantages.
NEUT24|There can also be consequences.
NEUT25|I spoke with the former AMD executive today, reminded me when AMD then CEO Hector Ruiz.
NEUT26|Was signaling at some type of deal with Apple was coming?
NEUT27|Wasn't public guess what happened?
NEUT28|That deal didn't go through, so you should know the culture of Apple you're dealing with there.
NEUT29|Unlike a lot of other tech Giants, they don't tip their hat.
NEUT30|He was coming their pipeline.
NEUT31|So I think a lot of people were surprised that I would have put out a statement like that.
NEUT32|I didn't get that memo, Josh, thank you.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT34|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
