NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, welcome back to is it a buy where we talk about stocks and try to determine if they are worth the buyer?"
NEUT1|Maybe pass my name is Cory.
NEUT2|I just like to preface the video by saying I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT3|I'm just a guy who likes to talk about stocks so please take what I say with a grain of salt.
NEUT4|Alright, let's get into the video today.
NEUT5|We were talking bout GameStop guys is some huge news about GameStop.
NEUT6|I'm so so excited about everything that's going on.
NEUT7|Take a look here.
NEUT8|So I did get this.
NEUT9|A Full disclosure.
NEUT10|I did get this from a fellow ape taking a look at the SEC filing and so that's where I did get this.
NEUT11|Page 15.
NEUT12|And so I figured, let me go ahead and break it down.
NEUT13|They did break it down here, but I wanted to break it down.
NEUT14|Kind of in my own terms to make sure I understand it so I can explain it very very simply.
NEUT15|OK, it's going to be a very short video to break it down so it looks like here's what they said.
BEAR16|Our star stock price in particular have have basically has had recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance.
NEUT17|OK, they go on to say a large portion of our Class A common stock has has been and may continue to be traded by short sellers, which has put and continue to put pressure on the supply and demand for our Class A common stock, further influencing price volatility in the market price OK and they go on and talk about a lot of volatility in how it's it's risky.
NEUT18|OK, they're not denying that, but look at look at exactly what's going on.
BULL19|They recognized the short squeeze OK, and talk about a little more volatility here, OK?
NEUT20|But take a look at this.
NEUT21|This is my.
NEUT22|Probably my favorite sentence in the whole thing other than acknowledging the short squeeze well, they acknowledge it here too.
NEUT23|But listen to this.
NEUT24|Investors with short exposure may have to pay a premium to repurchase those shares of Class A common stock for delivery.
BEAR25|2 lenders of our Class A common stock, so they're going to have to pay up.
NEUT26|They may have to pay a premium to repurchase the shares.
NEUT27|OK, these shorts.
NEUT28|This is huge.
NEUT29|Those repurchases may in turn dramatically.
NEUT30|Increase the price of the shares of the Class A common stock until additional shares over classic common stock are available for trading or borrowing.
NEUT31|This is often referred to as a short squeeze.
NEUT32|As they say it right here in black and white, and it looks like.
NEUT33|They may.
BEAR34|They're trying to get these shorts out OK, they understand that it's messing with their stock price, and granted, while the stock price is generally going in a very good direction, you know up which.
NEUT35|I'm sure they love.
BEAR36|There's a lot of volatility in its scaring away other more.
NEUT37|I guess traditional retail investors and they don't like this.
NEUT38|They want some kind of stability for this to be a real long term type hold of a stock.
NEUT39|OK and this is what they're trying to do.
BULL40|I'm very very excited that they finally acknowledge this.
NEUT41|And they're they're basically saying, hey, we see you, we see what you're doing.
NEUT42|We're not going to stand for it and we're going to try to shut you down so I'm very excited that they came out with this news an I'm super bullish on the stock and I'm can't wait to see what's going to happen.
BULL43|Man, I'm so excited.
NEUT44|But that's what you want to make a super super quick video just so we can get the word out.
NEUT45|Let people know.
BULL46|Hey, there may be an end insight and it's going to be great.
