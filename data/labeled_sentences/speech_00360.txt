BEAR0|"""Peter, the idea that this market is dictating fed policy to a much greater degree since December December, essentially forcing the Fed reserve retreat to patients and then pricing in rate cuts with no real encouragement from the FOMC and then all of a sudden the FOMC playing catch up."
NEUT1|Do you get the feeling the market is dictating where this Federal Reserve goes?
NEUT2|And perhaps not the economic data?
NEUT3|Yeah, I think that's very true.
NEUT4|I think you're seeing it across both in fixed income but also the equity markets.
NEUT5|I think everyone, including the president, seemed to look at the equity markets, 'cause it's the quickest measure of some sort of barometer of something.
NEUT6|And so we see it everyday.
NEUT7|It's in your face and that's where they kind of look to.
NEUT8|And as soon as you see performance, they're calling for their help.
NEUT9|And I think we're missing the point that the economy and the stock market aren't the same thing.
NEUT10|But we seem to be reacting much more to the stock market bond markets.
NEUT11|And one last thing quickly is, do you think people are right to be looking for the next problem?
NEUT12|What's the financial crisis?
NEUT13|And I tell you, people are looking in the wrong place is not going to be high yield.
NEUT14|It's not going to be leveraged loans.
NEUT15|It's going to be in a safe asset.
NEUT16|Every financial crisis we've ever had is really been a safe asset.
NEUT17|Look to SNL safe mortgages.
NEUT18|They just hedge the interest rates wrong.
BULL19|1998 Russia people viewed sovereigns as being very safe.
NEUT20|They don't default long term capital trillion dollar bets on swap spreads very safe.
NEUT21|2000 2001 Enron, Worldcom fraud.
NEUT22|It wasn't investment grade companies going bad was fraud, so you can do your analysis and then the last financial crisis was really the AAA mortgage backed paper.
NEUT23|So I think you're supposed to be looking at what are you really safe and what are you thinking you're leveraging 'cause it's so safe.
NEUT24|That's where the problem is going to come, but you know what?
NEUT25|A lot of people screaming back at the TV right now they're saying, is it the risk free asset then?
NEUT26|Is it government bonds?
NEUT27|I'm not sure.
NEUT28|It's government bonds.
NEUT29|One thing that popping up more and more on our radar screen.
NEUT30|We're starting to look at some of the commercial real estate.
NEUT31|There's something.
NEUT32|Again, what encourages me right now that we're not in a bubble in any way, shape or form is we don't see the leverage.
NEUT33|We don't see the credit products that we saw back in 2007 and eight.
NEUT34|You don't see these leverage super Senior.
NEUT35|You don't see synthetic CDO's.
NEUT36|They were called.
NEUT37|You just don't see a lot of the really funky products that leverage upon leverage and created Mark to market risk.
NEUT38|The big here's.
BULL39|There's not this mark to market contagion, and it's been reassuring.
BEAR40|I think even last summer when emerging markets were getting hit.
NEUT41|Normally, emerging markets get hit, it flows into high yield.
NEUT42|It did not.
BULL43|So I think people are running relatively safe portfolios.
NEUT44|"Aware of the risk they're taking and you don't get that knock on effect, so I don't think we're in risk and certainly not coming from the financial credit markets."""
