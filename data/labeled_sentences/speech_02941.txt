NEUT0|"""Well, for small time analysts, if you wanted to get noticed, money will put a sell rating on Facebook."
NEUT1|We got a great story here from Alexandra Scaggs Alex.
BULL2|Thanks for joining us so.
NEUT3|We got one quote from a guy from Battle Rd research.
NEUT4|He said you know what no one was calling before.
NEUT5|Tell us about that these these guys have kind of been working.
NEUT6|You know in their little niche with their client groups you know the chief research lies.
NEUT7|Yeah, yeah, they're the kinds that aren't on Facebook's IPO.
NEUT8|Exactly exactly a lot of them don't even have investment banking divisions, so they're kind of just doing this on their own there.
NEUT9|They're totally separate from the IPO, so now they're pretty much the only game in town for research.
NEUT10|And of course, investors were just.
NEUT11|So desperate ahead of ahead of the Facebook IPO because of course with all the bulge bracket firms that people on the IPO, there's this mandatory quiet period.
NEUT12|They aren't allowed to publish research for.
NEUT13|I think it's 40 days or 45 days 40 days after the issuance, right?
NEUT14|Yeah, so if anybody wanted to know well what's the next year's revenue going to be?
BEAR15|You know they couldn't find anything.
NEUT16|You know there was really a dearth of information out there right before this IPO.
NEUT17|And you know, people were looking and these guys stepped in.
NEUT18|Yeah, and Speaking of which, we've got a few in particular here.
NEUT19|I guess Ben Rosett battle Rd.
NEUT20|Scott Kessler at Capital IQ.
NEUT21|Brian is it, is it wiser from Pivotal Research Group, these guys put sell ratings on Facebook stock early.
NEUT22|Yeah yeah, they I think Battle Rd did it the day it started trading S&P Capital IQ a little bit after.
NEUT23|I mean these guys really kind of stepped in and made the tough call.
NEUT24|I think there are fewer seller ratings than there are by ratings.
NEUT25|We had a sell rating on it in the third column.
NEUT26|I will say that.
NEUT27|But yeah, I mean what's fascinating though, because of course during this whole process, one of the big well kerfuffle's is all about how the analysts that were on the IPO were being getting indications for management.
BEAR28|Hey guys, watch your figures this year is going to be slower than a lot of you are already expecting and they were giving that information to to institutional investors.
NEUT29|Meanwhile, the rest of us didn't.
NEUT30|Didn't really.
NEUT31|We had the perspectives to go on.
NEUT32|Yeah, and you know, but that's a little bit tricky because you know your average retail investor isn't going to look at one sentence change and be like, oh wow, this might.
NEUT33|You know this might mean a lot, but the analysts kind of, did you know they're the ones who are reading closely and you know it's funny 'cause with the underwriting banks you know they're not allowed to tell the public.
BEAR34|Almost so it kind of puts them in a weird position.
NEUT35|And it also puts you know these these small firms who you know people haven't really heard of before, really in the spotlight.
NEUT36|Yeah, and I want to ask one thing, when fascinating thing in your story, you mentioned FCC rule change that's coming up right?
NEUT37|And for smaller IPOs they.
NEUT38|Are going to be allowed to publish research companies on the IPO went ahead of the IPO were winning prices when it prices.
NEUT39|I think that wait the 40 days.
NEUT40|Yeah yeah they're not going to have to wait.
NEUT41|I mean they probably could issue before, but I you know, I think I guess the question is, is there a risk that will have you know pump and dumps with small companies who are coming up come to market?
NEUT42|They'll get research analysts that are supportive of the stock.
NEUT43|They just want to get out there and say hey by this thing could be a piece of junk.
NEUT44|But I mean is there is there that risk?
NEUT45|I wonder there could be kind of a risk.
NEUT46|Actually I think the biggest question that I've heard is whether they're actually going to.
NEUT47|Take advantage of this.
NEUT48|"It's funny 'cause everyone I've spoken to is like yeah we might do it before, but I think they realize that people are very critical."""
