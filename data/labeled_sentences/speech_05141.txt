NEUT0|"""Hi, this is color of sublime trade in this is a stocks analysis for Netflix."
NEUT1|Looking at the monthly time frame, we can see that prices in a nice strong uptrend here is last year's high and we can see that prices as moved far beyond that point.
NEUT2|This is a $400 round Number around here and we can see that price.
NEUT3|Try to breakthrough there a couple of times has failed, so it's finding this rounds number.
NEUT4|A hard area of resistance to breakthrough.
NEUT5|Looking at the weekly time frame prices above, the 50 simple moving average and also the 200 simple moving average.
BULL6|Overall, we're still in a nice uptrend as you can see on the on the weekly timeframe.
BULL7|Despite this deep pullback.
NEUT8|Now looking at the daily timeframe price is currently above the 50 simple moving average and also above the 200 simple moving average.
BULL9|Although it was trading in between these two moving averages for some time, prices finally managed to break back above it.
NEUT10|If we just draw in a support and resistance line here.
BULL11|So drawing from this high here, we can see that this has caused resistance.
NEUT12|Here it's been used as support here and again the support around here.
BEAR13|So at the moment, although this is a deep looking pullback is found support around this zone here.
BULL14|So we want price actually find some strength, some momentum to the upside and continue above the $400 and eventually break the previous auto high.
BULL15|So definitely one to keep on the watch list because we may get an opportunity soon so.
NEUT16|Remember, wait for a break in close above this high before looking at any longer opportunities.
