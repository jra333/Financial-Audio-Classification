BEAR0|"""A volatile trading session ends with a flat day on Wall Street."
BEAR1|The Dow finishing up two points closing at 25,967, the S&P 500 down four to end at 2879, and the NASDAQ down 20 points to finish at 7943.
NEUT2|Market analysis, as we mentioned from Jim Lowe, Lisa, Chief Investment Officer at Adviser Investments in the editor of Fidelity investor.com.
NEUT3|He's in The Newsroom.
NEUT4|Hi Jim, Abraham, all trade all the time now.
NEUT5|I'll trade all the time tomorrow.
NEUT6|I guess I have the storm.
NEUT7|Certainly investors.
NEUT8|Probably feeling like there.
BEAR9|In those Hurricane Hunter airplanes, the volatility has been noticeable fairly nerve wracking ride, not the kind of market you want to try and invest in.
NEUT10|Really the kind of market you want to invest through.
NEUT11|Ultimately, I think probability still skews in favor of at least some sort of optical deal, but it certainly doesn't look like going to get there come Friday.
NEUT12|All right, let's talk about the politics going on in DC.
BEAR13|Right now we've got the attorney general being held in contempt of Congress.
BEAR14|We've got Don Trump junior being subpoenaed.
NEUT15|By the Senate Intel Committee, how does that affect what market with the markets are doing right?
NEUT16|So we go from US, China to US versus USA.
NEUT17|Lot of it looks like campaign grandstanding, at least at this particular juncture.
BEAR18|That said, it's yet another straw of worry on investors back together, with all the geopolitical issues that continue to escalate rather than deescalate.
NEUT19|This is a time that's very difficult to be an investor, emotionally speaking, but it's precisely these kinds of times, especially in the market swoons on fear rather than fundamentals.
NEUT20|That long term investors can capitalize on, well, let's talk about fundamentals.
NEUT21|They still remain the bedrock of this strong market, frankly, everywhere, everywhere I look everywhere we analyze, we see strength, slow growth, not no growth.
BULL22|Here in the US, earnings absolutely strong economic data, especially as relates to the US consumer reflective of an economy that's in reasonably good shape.
BEAR23|Even the global economy, while slower than our own prone to more slowing than our own, remains on that slow growth trajectory.
NEUT24|So overall, the fundamentals.
BULL25|Earnings, inflation, economic data support the case for more, not less growth.
NEUT26|Let's talk a little earnings Disney.
NEUT27|I mean, did The Avengers carry them over the finish line?
NEUT28|Well, you know, not yet interesting.
NEUT29|Lee Disney did report today.
BEAR30|They beat on earnings, but it was their fiscal second quarter.
NEUT31|So that comes in ahead of the $2 billion plus windfall from end game.
BULL32|So Disney, obviously enjoying the earnings beat and also investor optimism on what they know will be a windfall.
NEUT33|Coming down the Pike.
NEUT34|And we've got the Uber IPO coming up.
NEUT35|They set the price tomorrow.
NEUT36|Then on Friday they actually have the IPO.
NEUT37|What are we looking at here?
BEAR38|So Uber says suggesting there pulling the the IPO price range down to the mid, maybe to the low range.
BEAR39|Clearly this is a market where the mood has shifted dramatically just in the last handful of days.
BEAR40|Obviously a national strike today and also potential investor concerns with the overall proposition.
NEUT41|That said, when they price Friday if they can get their their voice heard above the din of US, China trade chatter, it could be a very interesting day for Uber stock.
NEUT42|Alright, Jim Lowell adviser Investments Newton MA.
BULL43|Thanks Jim.
BULL44|"Thanks Brian."""
