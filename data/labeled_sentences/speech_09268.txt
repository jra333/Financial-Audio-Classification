NEUT4|So as you can tell, being Geo had just really.
NEUT5|It's really been playing around.
BEAR6|It's just been really trading sideways.
NEUT7|Nothing interesting in here.
BEAR8|I do want it to go below $4.
BULL9|I think that's a fair price for me to start getting in on some more shares.
NEUT10|I don't really see it.
NEUT11|Is it like it wants to go below there?
NEUT12|But I really wanted to go below here, but as you guys know this is not this is a new stock for the run up, but it's not a new stock.
NEUT13|Overall the all time highs is like $10.00 so you still have a lot of time to get in before it starts making all time highs.
NEUT14|But this one was very good, Mr runs that I'm trying to be in not any of this right here, so I really needed to break out of any level, either the downside or upside, preferably the downside in these levels.
NEUT15|My by target is around $4 even and then I see some support around 3.48.
NEUT16|I Wilson knows a buy alerts on my Patreon page link down below so.
NEUT17|Right now it really needs to go One Direction 'cause it has these pops up pop up and then it just trades like this.
NEUT18|Doesn't really go anywhere.
BEAR19|So right now they might be building up orders or their building something and we could see newer highs, but I wanted to drop more.
BEAR20|I feel like you didn't drop enough.
BEAR21|And I just had a slow drop.
NEUT22|Not really nothing big after this sharp run, so using on sharp runs I like the C sharp declines.
NEUT23|We did see it here, but then it kind of stalled.
BULL24|So I feel like it might have some more drop in it, but if it does start making new highs then I'll have some new support levels for you guys.
NEUT25|But right now this is how I'm looking at it.
NEUT26|And how I'm playing the stock?
NEUT27|So remember in understanding the bar, so anything is for educational purposes only.
NEUT28|"So do not try anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
