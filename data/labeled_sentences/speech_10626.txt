NEUT0|"""Yeah, well I think Crown, Castle and Elliot need talk to sing out."
NEUT1|Oh, that's right about focusing on towers and it's so lucrative.
NEUT2|It's one of the Crown Castle just doesn't stick with those.
NEUT3|Sure all these fibers, small cell investments have been expensive, but that's because Crown Castle spent years laying the groundwork for the 5G buildout, which is only just getting started as the five G put up picks up speed.
BULL4|The major carriers will need Crown Castle fiber based small cell sites management is betting that the Morgans for Fiber will go a lot higher as demand increases.
NEUT5|Basically, Crown Castle believes this is the future of wireless.
BULL6|In part because it works much better than cell towers in densely populated areas.
NEUT7|True, they spent all this money to own the future.
NEUT8|True, if the right to leave American Tower in SBC in the dust over the next few years.
NEUT9|But if that's the case, management needs to make this argument much more forcefully.
NEUT10|I wouldn't be surprised if Eli it's open to being persuaded, or at least be open minded.
NEUT11|No need for storage.
BULL12|Scorched earth here, as James Brown and his team have a terrific long term track record.
BULL13|Either way, though, I think there's a lot of room for compromise here.
BEAR14|Maybe Crown Castle cut some of the slowest return fiber projects.
NEUT15|Raise the dividend $6 a year instead of instead of the seven, though it's asking for.
BULL16|That will give it a juicy 3.6% yield.
NEUT17|Maybe they convince Elliot that fiber is the future.
NEUT18|However, this plays out.
NEUT19|You know what?
NEUT20|Here's what's important.
BULL21|I think it's good for you, the shareholders, always doing what's right for its partners, but that could be great news for you too.
NEUT22|Situation might as well.
NEUT23|It's involved with eBay.
NEUT24|This started about 18 months ago, for while he was willing to work with Elliot, although eventually there were some pretty significant disagreements.
BEAR25|CEO CEO had to resign September.
BULL26|The key, though, is the E base rallied nearly 90% since Elliot got involved.
NEUT27|See how smart they are.
NEUT28|Bottom line, we know how these activist situations play out.
NEUT29|Either Crown Castle gives Elliot what they want.
NEUT30|Can you get a leaner, meaner cell tower play with a high given or Crown Castle up this game to fend off the activists?
BULL31|Either way, this already good story could get even better, as Eliot's work as always is top notch and begs to be listened to.
