BEAR0|"""The markets on a 5 day losing streak were down about 5% from recent highs."
BEAR1|There is a rotation going on right now as people are selling the stocks that ran up the most over the last 3-4 months are now getting hit the hardest financials in tech.
BULL2|The defensive now are performing better utilities.
BEAR3|Consumer staples people are worried about Europe.
NEUT4|We've been talking about this how many years, years, years.
NEUT5|I don't wanna say this time is different.
NEUT6|I'm not going to use any sort of phrase like that because it doesn't feel different, doesn't it, doesn't it, doesn't it doesn't it does in the sense that I think that people are really.
NEUT7|Truly concerned that Greece is going to leave the eurozone and what are going to be the implications from that.
BEAR8|Yes, Greece is a disaster.
BEAR9|Yes their government is in shambles.
BEAR10|Yes, there's rioting on the streets.
NEUT11|That's nothing new, but what happens when Greece leaves the euro?
NEUT12|Let's look right now.
NEUT13|Europe basically got that message today.
BEAR14|They were down between two 3% right?
NEUT15|Which is really.
NEUT16|I mean it's it's bad, but it's not that bad.
BEAR17|It's bad.
NEUT18|It's not that bad, but this is the big concern right now, because what is the ripple effect?
NEUT19|What happens to the other 16 nations in the eurozone?
NEUT20|And so there is so much.
NEUT21|People just don't know.
NEUT22|I mean so much fun so much as, well.
NEUT23|You know what I'm going to tell you?
NEUT24|You know the question.
NEUT25|I think for many investors out there, Steve is a little bit of you know, do I buy on the dips or do I basically wait until things settle out right?
NEUT26|And you know, well, I'll just talk about how I look at it.
NEUT27|Maybe you can give me some of your thoughts, but I kind of look at and go.
NEUT28|You know what markets they had a great start of the year.
BULL29|They had a big run up valuations right now, at least on the basis of corporate earnings, expected corporate earnings.
NEUT30|And if you believe the US.
NEUT31|GDP growth will be somewhere between 2, two and a half percent.
NEUT32|They the valuations are not that pressing.
NEUT33|So I look at I go.
NEUT34|You know what stocks come in a little bit, maybe 5-6 percent.
NEUT35|You know now is when I start thinking about maybe buying some stocks, not stocks.
NEUT36|I buy index funds.
NEUT37|But just because I look at and I go, you know what?
NEUT38|Things don't look so expensive to me.
NEUT39|I'd rather be buying now than buying a month ago when a lot of the valuations look frothy.
NEUT40|What am I getting wrong?
NEUT41|Well, I'm not buying stocks right now, so I can't be giving you advice on that, but I would say though.
NEUT42|This week in particular if you want to look at very short term horizon there earning season is coming to an end.
NEUT43|There's not a lot of economic data on the calendar.
BEAR44|The focus is on Europe right now, and as we have seen time and time again when the clear focuses on Europe, that's not a good sign for markets.
NEUT45|I don't know when that ever has been a good sign for markets, so that if I was in the market, I think I would be particularly worried about that.
NEUT46|Because you're right, the fundamentals do look they look question.
NEUT47|The question really is, you know what people's time Horizon or their perspective is on the market.
NEUT48|You cover the markets.
NEUT49|On a day to day basis, many of the people who watch you know the business shows CNBC or Bloomberg or Fox business.
NEUT50|They're looking on a minute by minute basis.
NEUT51|How is the market going to trade?
NEUT52|I don't look at it that way.
NEUT53|I look at three five year time Horizons, and to me I look at kind of opportunities when people are selling for no obvious reason.
NEUT54|"That to me is an opportunity to buy."""
