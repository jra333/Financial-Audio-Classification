BEAR0|"""New chief executive Jes Staley presented his debut set of results on Tuesday, which went down pretty poorly with investors."
BEAR1|The bank missed analyst expectations with an annual net loss of £394 million that swell up from the previous year.
BEAR2|It also slid to a pretax loss of almost £2 billion in the final quarter of last year, hit by a big provision.
NEUT3|To cover UK customer compensation for MIS selling insurance products.
BEAR4|Shares in Barclays were down 9 1/2% in midafternoon trading, taking them close to their 52 week low.
BEAR5|They're down almost 40% over the past year.
NEUT6|The bank announced plans to sell its 62% stake in its African subsidiary over two to three years, as it reorganizes itself around two key divisions.
NEUT7|Its UK retail bank and its more global corporate and investment banking unit.
BEAR8|It also announced a cut of more than 50% in its dividend for 2016 and 2017.
NEUT9|The bank says regulations make it an uneconomic owner of the African business, but a key factor is the same one behind the dividend cut.
BEAR10|In other words, the bank needs to boost its capital buffer and it isn't generating enough earnings to do so without shedding assets.
BEAR11|Problem Barclays has is that it keeps promising jam tomorrow with more pain today and this is the latest in a long line of restructuring attempts.
BEAR12|"The problem is that investors are losing patients rapidly."""
