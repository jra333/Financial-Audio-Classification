NEUT0|"""Should we be concerned?"
NEUT1|Do you think inflation is just around the corner?
NEUT2|And where does that leave market bubbles as well?
NEUT3|Right, yeah, the bottom line is that I think it's more likely to have asset price inflation than consumer price inflation, even though we might have a short lived consumer price inflation in the spring.
NEUT4|But I do think that yeah, despite the magnitude of the fiscal package $1.9 trillion, I think that we are, you know, the inflation burst that we might see in the spring will be will be shortly.
NEUT5|Why is that?
BEAR6|Because I think you know, there's still some consumer anxiety.
NEUT7|I also do not think that commodity prices will feed into core prices.
NEUT8|And with regards to the to the Fed.
NEUT9|Actually what you see is that when he goes when money goes into financial assets, it doesn't doesn't go into the real economy necessarily.
NEUT10|So I'm actually quite serious about the inflation risk.
NEUT11|However, two things to mention, one is that if they were a further infrastructure package, I think then we could start looking at a different equation and point #2 is that we still have to be worried about the confidence and the trust in the financial system.
NEUT12|And in economique policymaking, because you know, there's a buildup of debt.
BEAR13|Confidence so far is actually quite strong, even though you see you know at the at the edge of the system some gradual erosion in confidence.
BULL14|But confidence is still there.
NEUT15|But you know things can turn on a dime there, and we need trust in the financial system, and we have to be careful with economic policymaking, not going to extreme Thomas.
BEAR16|What we have seen in the last couple of weeks as market rates have spiked, it has taken some of the excess out of.
NEUT17|Particular stocks and parts.
BULL18|The market where there's been rapid momentum.
BEAR19|In recent months I want to ask about the outlook then from here because it feels as though we could be in for a couple of bumpy quarters on this bounce back recovery story.
BEAR20|Little bit like what we saw last year when we saw a plunge and some of the demand numbers based on the services economy being largely shot.
NEUT21|It doesn't feel like normal numbers are going to come through.
BULL22|We're going to Spike potentially as economies open up and then a bit more normalization, maybe more spikes down the road.
NEUT23|Have a market rates weather that storm that could be coming.
NEUT24|Well, regarding long term rates, I think what's going on right now is that there is, you know, the bond market is testing the Fed Jerome Powell on.
NEUT25|Well, you know, two days ago was quite serious about long term rates.
NEUT26|Yesterday is showed a bit more cautiousness by mentioning, you know, those three years insisting on three years before the at least three years before the first rate hike.
BULL27|So it starts to lean against the rise in long term yields.
NEUT28|But you may have to do a bit more.
BEAR29|Bond market may again test the Fed in my in my view.
BEAR30|Now I do not think the feds tolerance to the rise in long term yields.
NEUT31|Is that elevated?
NEUT32|You know the US economy has a lot of debt.
NEUT33|It's very sensitive to long term rates.
BULL34|I think the Fed will start to lean against the rising long term yields more than it has in the past few days.
BULL35|Also, you know we need the housing market, so if you see a strong rise in long term rates you could see you know a bumpy road ahead for the housing housing market.
NEUT36|So I think that's.
NEUT37|Also another consideration and to come back to your point about the bumpiness of the recovery.
NEUT38|Yeah, I think it will be bumpy.
BEAR39|They'll be stopping going the reopening, especially until we get full vaccination, which is still not expected before the summer.
BULL40|"And also yeah, bumpiness also coming from you know financial market movements including long term yields."""
