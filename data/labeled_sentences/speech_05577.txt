NEUT0|"""Hello everyone Analytics Age today is Wednesday 30th of December 2020."
NEUT1|Time is 3 minutes past 2:00 o'clock in the morning UK time.
NEUT2|Amazon for our chart.
NEUT3|So last video publisher Amazon.
NEUT4|I give you 2 scenarios.
NEUT5|The first scenario that we have an impulsive, corrective and impulsive and the other scenario to have a triangle to go up.
NEUT6|So currently the bearish scenario.
NEUT7|One of the very scenario got invalidated.
NEUT8|So idea of having.
NEUT9|Unimpulsive and then having a triangle as a B. CDE has gotten validated, but there could be another scenario.
NEUT10|I draw it here for you.
NEUT11|We can have a BC.
NEUT12|This makes more sense because the waves should be longer.
NEUT13|See the E and then done so.
NEUT14|This is still a valid scenario as well.
NEUT15|To be honest, for the Amazon I like to see this level to get broken, to place myself in a very very safe zone 3496 for now.
NEUT16|So this was one scenario.
NEUT17|The triangle scenario could be which I don't give my chance because this is an impulsive wave.
NEUT18|That's why I'm not giving my chance to the uptrend triangle.
NEUT19|But that might happen because sometimes we can have impulsive waves as a leg in the triangle as well.
NEUT20|So that scenario would be we have the wave A.
NEUT21|Then we have the wave B.
NEUT22|We have the wave C maybe maybe we had the day Ede and then up.
NEUT23|This could be one scenario or we had the wave ABC the Wave D. E and then up.
NEUT24|So this is another scenario that can happen as well.
BULL25|In both cases, I still want to see 3496, so 3496 is a level that if gets broken, I'm expecting a strong move because it invalidates the bearish scenario and validates the uptrend scenario as well.
BULL26|"Thanks for watching and have a good night."""
