NEUT0|"""It's playing this video chart on ticker symbol, AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do often explanation video at that link will be in the office today, but I will anyway just to establish some context.
BULL4|Very impressive balance.
NEUT5|I mean you think about the fact that just on Friday that price was flirting with these lows and now the price is all the way up there.
NEUT6|Any rational person would say, yeah, that was definitely a very nice move, but that doesn't have valid question of.
NEUT7|But is there any sort of true power behind this pricing?
NEUT8|Is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT9|Where is this?
NEUT10|Just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead cat?
NEUT12|You know bounce site move and I have no idea.
NEUT13|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area and that area.
NEUT14|Is down here at 121 fifty now?
NEUT15|I'm not saying this will occur, but for explanation sake, let's say the price comes down here to 121.
NEUT16|Fifty behaves in that manner and then continues on down.
NEUT17|What would you have at that point?
NEUT18|You would quite literally have the price having gone right back to that area of the chart.
NEUT19|And I mean not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT20|But Price was like go back to where they were not exactly sound true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT21|Now to be fair though, no price, just go straight up either.
NEUT22|So maybe the price does come down here, but the difference being behaves in that manner.
NEUT23|Then start to curl back upwards.
NEUT24|Now all of a sudden what you have, you have a set of those right there.
NEUT25|You have that set.
NEUT26|Of those down there, and if you envision each one of those stair steps, well, hey there we go.
NEUT27|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT28|And again, that's the name of the game.
BULL29|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT30|And in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined at that green line as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT31|First, the area to watch very closely going to be right there at $124 and then after 124 next key level after that would be right up there at.
NEUT32|Let's see what is at 125 fifty so 124.
NEUT33|One 2550 next key battlegrounds.
NEUT34|But All in all any angle you look at it.
BULL35|Very impressive bounds today.
NEUT36|Not just a question of can the price build upon this balance moving forward.
NEUT37|Let's see what happens.
NEUT38|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT39|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT40|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL41|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT42|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT43|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR44|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT45|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT46|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT47|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT48|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
