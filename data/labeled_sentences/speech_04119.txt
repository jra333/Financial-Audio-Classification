NEUT1|You said you're going to make a decision on 7 nanometer, but how much of that you're going to be doing in House?
NEUT2|How much of it you might outsource to foundry?
NEUT3|How much of an impact on margin should investors expect longer term?
NEUT4|If you do outsource 7 nanometer versus if you don't?
NEUT5|Yeah, I mean first as we play a larger and larger role in the success of our customers with the investments we've been making that with, that comes a responsibility and that responsibility for us is to provide a predictable cadence of leadership products for our customers.
NEUT6|So for us we have a wonderful product road map for 2021 and 22 and when we look into 23 we have a decision to make about whether to build that next generation of product.
NEUT7|On Intel's manufacturing footprint on 3rd party manufacturing footprint or on a mix of both and we've been designing our products to have the inherent flexibility to make those decisions overtime.
NEUT8|So in the next couple months will be looking at what's the right decision for 2023 products and will be evaluating a series of criteria schedule predictability.
NEUT9|Very important for our customers.
NEUT10|Second product performance.
NEUT11|Process matters, but so do a lot of other things, like software and 3rd.
NEUT12|How do we retain some of the essential benefits of designing and making stuff for ourselves in the event we take things outside with the relationships that we have with our third party?
NEUT13|Foundry partners.
NEUT14|OK, so we're going through that assessment now.
NEUT15|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT16|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
