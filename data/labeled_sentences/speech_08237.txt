BULL0|"""So you are neutral on the stock and investors after this earnings report seemed to be perhaps validating that at least mindset."
BULL1|But Oh my goodness, did you expect to see what we saw in China growth nearly 60% up and consider what we're seeing in iPad and Mac and the margin potential in the Apple Home Grown chips in that category as that plays out throughout the year?
NEUT2|Might that change your mind?
NEUT3|Yeah, it's interesting John.
NEUT4|I mean no question about it.
BULL5|This was a phenomenal quarter by any standards.
NEUT6|You know the expectation from the buy side in our conversations was about 108 to 110 billion.
NEUT7|Going into this print, which explains the stock reaction.
NEUT8|I mean, the expectations were clearly super elevated going into the parent and the guidance was somewhere around 77 billion expectations from the buy side.
NEUT9|So we got what people were looking for.
BULL10|We probably got a little more than what people were looking for, but the expectations were so high that that's sort of.
NEUT11|Translating into into this sort of a stock reaction now on the China growth, specifically, it was very, very impressive.
BULL12|I mean, they did have some easier comps from the prior year and we do have the fact that the currency moved quite significantly in China from, you know, 7.2 RMB per dollar to do something like 6.4 now, so you've had about a 12% implicit pricing benefit over there as well.
NEUT13|So it is all said and done.
NEUT14|I mean, it's undisputably like a phenomenal you very strong.
BULL15|Water and the most impressive thing was really on the gross margin side, so kudos to them for executing so well in this tough environment.
NEUT16|Now Chris Walmsley is neutral.
NEUT17|On the other hand, for you, Apple is one of the best ideas.
NEUT18|So why is this kind of a multiple justified?
NEUT19|I mean trading at more than 30 times at the size it is, even given the growth potential.
NEUT20|That's that's quite a valuation.
NEUT21|Yeah, fair enough John.
NEUT22|I mean, the reality is that you know I don't look at Apple as a single product company that people used to look in the past.
NEUT23|And also when I look at like you know the hardware side, you have iPhone, the variables, the Mac, the you know the iPads are growing on the services side.
NEUT24|It's not one single line item is definitely have.
NEUT25|Like you know App Store.
NEUT26|Yeah like the payments etc.
NEUT27|So I think Apple is kind of like feels like you know there are multiple angles of growth so from that standpoint even if you try to bucket each of those revenue opportunities.
NEUT28|Each of them has a different drug profile.
NEUT29|Each of them has a different multiple profile to our valuation profile, and then you take all of that.
NEUT30|You can argue, like, hey, it's it's.
NEUT31|It's kind of like expensive relative to your hardware stock.
NEUT32|It's cheaper than a software stock, but in the reality is then you add another layer which is the free cash flow yield given the cash flow generation of this company, I think it kind of makes it look still relatively inexpensive on many of those metrics.
NEUT33|And the other thing I'd also say is that you know, besides the monster beaten impressive numbers.
NEUT34|I think just the scale of the company is very impressive that people tend to forget that you know, in in the nitty gritty of things.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
