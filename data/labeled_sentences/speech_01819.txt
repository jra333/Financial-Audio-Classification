NEUT0|"""In this video, will cover how to calculate a correlation in Google Sheets as a very brief overview, correlation measures the degree of the linear relationship between two variables."
NEUT1|It ranges from negative one to positive one where positive correlation higher scores on X go with higher scores on.
NEUT2|Why a negative correlation, higher scores on echo with lower scores on why?
NEUT3|And then with a 0 or no correlation, there's no relationship or predictable pattern between X&Y.
NEUT4|So to calculate correlation in Google Sheets, we just want to go ahead and let's go ahead and type correlation here and then.
NEUT5|Format this very briefly.
NEUT6|Here's our correlation.
NEUT7|Will put it in this cell here.
NEUT8|Cell F2.
NEUT9|Let's increase the font here and then fold it OK to calculate the correlation.
NEUT10|What we want to do is we start by typing the = that tells Google Sheets that we're going to use a function and the function name for correlation is coral or CORREL.
NEUT11|And then what I want to do next is do an (and then when I do that, notice here Google Sheets gives me some examples of how to do this.
NEUT12|And really all I want to do is I want to select inside the parentheses first the data for LSAT score.
NEUT13|And then after that I want to select the data for college GPA and that will tell Google Sheets to calculate a correlation between these two variables.
NEUT14|So Garden Select SAT score.
NEUT15|All those values and I'm going to go back up here and notice I didn't select the variable name.
NEUT16|Hey, I'll press control and it should be command key for Max.
NEUT17|And I'm going to select the next column.
NEUT18|And then that's it.
BULL19|That looks perfect.
NEUT20|And then notice here the values are selected.
NEUT21|Now.
NEUT22|The way I finish off this function as I put a closed parentheses there and I press enter.
NEUT23|Alright, that is it.
NEUT24|I'm going to do italicize that and then let's go ahead and dial this down to two decimal places.
NEUT25|Now notice that the correlation is positive.
NEUT26|A positive .64 anaza review positive correlation means that higher scores on X go with higher scores on Y, where X&Y are just are variables.
NEUT27|Generically.
NEUT28|So since we correlated the values between the SAT score.
NEUT29|And college GPA.
BULL30|That means there's a positive relationship here, which should make sense if you think about it.
NEUT31|Higher S80 scores go with higher college GPA, so that is people who do better on the essay.
BULL32|T tend to do better in college and that should make sense.
BEAR33|Whereas people who don't do as well in the essay T tend to not do as well in college as measured by GPA.
NEUT34|And we could format this briefly here.
NEUT35|Let's see.
NEUT36|Make this stand out just a little bit.
NEUT37|Put a little color into it.
NEUT38|OK, there we go.
NEUT39|So the correlation is .64 in this example.
NEUT40|OK, that's it.
BULL41|"Thanks for watching."""
