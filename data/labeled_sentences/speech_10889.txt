BEAR0|"""Mike, how much further has the dollar got to go on the down sides with through 121?"
NEUT1|Just give us your sense of of of this accelerating and what that could mean to your thesis.
NEUT2|Yeah, I mean a dollar weakness is a big part of our reflationary story.
NEUT3|I think it's already happening.
NEUT4|The thesis is.
BEAR5|I think it's a pretty consensus thesis, by the way, that you know Dollar should be weaker because the US is being the most aggressive with structural deficits going forward.
BULL6|And you know, quite frankly, a weaker dollar is helpful for the world, right?
BEAR7|A strong dollar is a bit of a constriction on global growth, so we think the dollar could we.
BULL8|Can you know, another 10% pretty easily over the next 12 months or so.
BEAR9|That doesn't mean we can't have rallies in the interim periods, but but the direction is down.
NEUT10|We think it's introduced structural, secular bear market, year ago two years ago and the pandemic has accelerated that and it ultimately a positive story for the reflation idea, right?
BULL11|Global nominal GDP growth will benefit, you know inflation will return, which is what's needed to manage the extraordinary debt that we've all accumulated over the last 10 or 20 years.
NEUT12|"So it's part of the story for sure."""
