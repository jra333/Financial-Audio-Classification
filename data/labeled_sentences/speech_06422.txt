NEUT0|"""Hi guys this is John from brostocks.com."
NEUT1|I just want to make a quick video on Amazon ticker AMZN.
NEUT2|What we're looking at right now is daily chart.
NEUT3|For a year, each bar is a day and what I want to look at is obviously you could see that.
NEUT4|I've drawn in my retracement and Fibonacci extensions.
NEUT5|And I'm thinking that if.
NEUT6|Monday comes and Amazon holds this 314.
NEUT7|Price level, which is the 61.8 fibbonaci.
NEUT8|An breaks at 3:17 and stays above it.
BULL9|I think we have a good move up towards you know the 3:20 to 3:24 level.
NEUT10|Now there is a lot of resistance as you can see over here.
NEUT11|At 3:22 level, so I drew this.
NEUT12|Price level line right here, but there's also, you know, the 50% Fibonacci and also this swing high to swing.
BEAR13|Low extension 61.8 Fibonacci level at 327.
NEUT14|So I'm thinking that if we have a.
BULL15|Bullish day on Monday, Amazon could rip up to at least 320 to 322 if it breaks that LC 324 to 327, probably consolidator on here if it holds this level.
NEUT16|Probably see the 3:30 to 3:35 so I will be playing calls on Monday.
NEUT17|I will be waiting for a good entry.
NEUT18|Maybe it will, you know, wash out a little bit 'cause it did close at three.
NEUT19|1680 on Friday, so maybe it'll you know dip to like 314.
NEUT20|Will see if it tests this level.
NEUT21|Holds it.
NEUT22|I'll be getting in some calls and hopefully.
NEUT23|You know, look for a 50% gain 60% gain lock the profits in and see what happens.
NEUT24|Alright guys, that's my take on Amazon.
NEUT25|"Good luck and have fun."""
