NEUT0|"""Do you think it's optimistic?"
NEUT1|OK, we also did a trendline analysis of Italy.
NEUT2|Take a look at this.
BULL3|If new cases keep declining at the same pace, Italy could be in the clear by May 12th.
NEUT4|The charts.
NEUT5|No emotion charts of motion.
BULL6|What about Germany, where they've done a much better job of slowing the spread since the peak on April 2nd?
BEAR7|New cases have declined dramatically.
BULL8|It's the same general up and down slope based on his forecast, Williams thinks will be in the clear by May 5th, and Jeremy's already started to gradually reopen its economy.
NEUT9|How about a country that handled the outbreak about as badly as you can?
NEUT10|Let's talk about Iran.
NEUT11|All right?
NEUT12|Take a look at the Daily new case.
NEUT13|Count in Iran.
NEUT14|Again, we use points out that we've seen the same basic trajectory.
NEUT15|The president, question the numbers and last weekend show what does it all mean for the United States?
NEUT16|Alright, here we go.
NEUT17|Take a look at our daily new case chart where we getting it Hopkins apples to apples are new cases accelerated starting on March 11 we seem to peak on April 10.
BEAR18|Since then we've seen a gradual decline in new cases, although some of that may be because we haven't been able to scale up testing as rapidly as we would have liked.
NEUT19|Still using the 30 day averages of countries that have already peaked.
BULL20|We have projects that new cases were formed by to a manageable level.
NEUT21|By May 11th.
NEUT22|12th.
NEUT23|That's right, as he sees it, our country should be able to reopen in just a few weeks time.
NEUT24|Now, if that sounds too good to be true, believe me I get it.
NEUT25|I told you this was a shocking prediction.
BEAR26|My God says this forecast is too optimistic.
NEUT27|Maybe way too optimistic, but Williams is such a strong tracker that I thought was worth putting this idea out there.
NEUT28|Here's the bottom line.
BEAR29|I'm still very worried about this pandemic, just not as well as I was when I came back from the Super Bowl, which I didn't go to.
NEUT30|'cause I want to come tonight, but this thing, but I worry bout it everyday.
NEUT31|I'm scared like you alright, but the charge is interpreted by Larry Williams.
BULL32|Suggested the future might be brighter than we expect, so I hope he's right.
NEUT33|Although to me this person seems like a real longshot.
NEUT34|Who knows though, sometimes longshots.
NEUT35|Pay off.
