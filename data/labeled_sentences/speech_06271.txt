BULL0|"""Hello traders, you have reached the Phantom coming to you."
NEUT1|Live from The Phantoms crypt where we are haunting the charts and.
NEUT2|Resurrecting profits in a downright ghastly market, this is going to be a short video than normal, as were simply bringing this to you to let you know an update on our recent call on Amazon.
NEUT3|Please take the time to check out the prior video that we put out September 14th, 2010 for forwarded full details that were just kind of a quick recap.
BEAR4|We had noticed a clear head and shoulders pattern possibly developing on the daily charts and Amazon.
NEUT5|But to make this a little bit sweeter and a little bit different than what we normally see, this head and shoulders pattern is floating above a large gap up from October 23rd, 2009.
NEUT6|We call this the guillotine trade as the decapitated stock is hanging above an old gap up.
NEUT7|Targets to the downside of this pattern holds would be the neckline around 1:11 and then get fill way down to 94 as we discussed on the prior and video.
NEUT8|It's taken about 12 months for this to form and so.
NEUT9|When fully coming to fruition could take a little bit longer, but here's what we're seeing since the prior.
NEUT10|Video we put out.
NEUT11|Let's take a little bit closer.
NEUT12|Look at this right shoulder.
NEUT13|The first red line here is the high from the left shoulder as shown on the prior chart around 1:45 ninety one.
BEAR14|As you see, we had three days where the stock certainly held below that level.
BULL15|We had one clear break out to the upside on.
NEUT16|Pretty good volume, but we'd like to find a confirmation before we think anything is.
NEUT17|A real move, unfortunately.
NEUT18|Well, Fortunately for us, there's not a real confirmation on the next day.
BULL19|This breakout above the left shoulder level I got up to about one 4823.
BULL20|We'd like to see a follow up day closed above the prior high, and we did close at 148 thirty two, which is about $0.09 above the prior close.
NEUT21|That may not be strong enough to really suggest a confirmation.
NEUT22|And we aren't believers that the pattern has been broken just yet.
BULL23|To further confirm that this strong up move may be slowing down is the fact that we have a shining star candle turning at the end of this run up.
NEUT24|This is the level to watch the prior left shoulder.
NEUT25|I have a 145 ninety one that could serve as at least a short term support in the near term.
NEUT26|The next level would be a double top high from the head at around one 5109 at the stock breaks above that level and we would negate the head shoulders pattern.
BULL27|But given this strong.
BULL28|Run up on relatively average volume.
NEUT29|We don't believe that our pattern has been discredited, so we're going to be watching that closely and watch with us.
NEUT30|Check out the prior video and stay tuned.
BEAR31|"Be careful 'cause it's scary out there."""
