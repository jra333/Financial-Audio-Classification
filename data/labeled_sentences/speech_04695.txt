NEUT0|"""You want to hit on Amazon since Prime Day started today."
NEUT1|It's a two day event.
NEUT2|Of course.
NEUT3|I was on this site looking around for it.
NEUT4|I mean, I'm always looking for a deal Gene, but what I noticed about Prime Day was that a lot of the deals were the Amazon in-house brand products and I'm wondering what your take on Prime Day was today.
NEUT5|So that's, uh, there's two topics going on.
NEUT6|What's prime day all about now.
NEUT7|It's about building brand more broadly, just the Amazon brand.
NEUT8|It used to be about gaining prime members when they started five years ago.
NEUT9|There were 70 million prime members.
NEUT10|Now there's about 150,000,000 mission accomplished for Prime beta.
NEUT11|Add 'cause you gotta be a prime member to participate in Prime Day.
NEUT12|But then there's this dynamic about what you're picking up, which is really gets to what's going on in the regulatory environment with Amazon.
NEUT13|How much should they be promoting their own products?
NEUT14|How much do they compete with the sellers on there?
NEUT15|Platform, I'm not surprised to hear that I have not been shopping on Prime Day.
NEUT16|I will undoubtedly look in this 48 hour window, but my simple take on it this way is Amazon should be careful and tread.
NEUT17|Tread softly on this because this is a hot button and they don't want to poke the bear.
NEUT18|This is precisely the issue outlined in that House report.
BULL19|Jean, great to speak with you.
NEUT20|Thank you.
NEUT21|Thank you Gene Munster.
NEUT22|You pick guy Apple or Amazon?
NEUT23|What do you want to trade?
NEUT24|Choose, choose your adventure an adventure.
NEUT25|I would trade so so this is not a would you rather, but I'll turn it into one since he was able to do that earlier.
NEUT26|I would rather Amazon here and I'll tell you why, because Apple reports at the end of the month I think on the 29th, obviously they fired the split bullet last quarter.
BEAR27|This is sort of a weird quarter for them.
NEUT28|You wonder how much was pulled forward?
NEUT29|This move from 103 to 120 is basically a textbook.
BEAR30|50% retracement of the recent all time high and that 103 low.
NEUT31|Makes sense that it stopped here.
BEAR32|Amazon, I think continues to run into earnings.
NEUT33|I said that last night.
NEUT34|So given the parameters that you just said, I would rather Amazon right here, alright?
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
