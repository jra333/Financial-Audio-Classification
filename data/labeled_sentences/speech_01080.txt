NEUT0|"""Matt, I know that you say you are cautious on some recent high Flyers, namely Apple, NVIDIA, Tesla, Google."
NEUT1|What do you think people should do if they're holding these stocks right now?
NEUT2|I mean, do they take some chips off the table?
NEUT3|Yeah, I think they do.
NEUT4|I mean the just the the huge moves they've seen over the last couple of months.
BEAR5|I mean videos up just in the last three weeks is up.
BEAR6|33% is just an unbelievable move here.
NEUT7|We all see what's going on in Tesla.
BEAR8|Of course an Apple and Microsoft and a lot of these stars have become very very overbought on a technical basis based on their relative strength index.
BEAR9|Their weekly and daily RSI numbers are gone.
NEUT10|The levels that are usually followed by pullbacks.
NEUT11|So I think you know it doesn't mean you have to sell all of your Apple or all of your Microsoft.
NEUT12|But maybe it raise a little cash there and look for a dip in these names because they've been the big high Flyers when the market, I mean markets are going up in a straight line are not normal and healthy.
BEAR13|That doesn't mean we're going to submit run into a bear market or recession, but we are getting ripe for a pullback.
BEAR14|And those stocks will come down the most.
BULL15|And if you've got a little cash on the sidelines, you're going to be able to take advantage of.
BEAR16|Maybe there's a baby getting torn up with the with the bathwater a little bit.
NEUT17|And again, is that my point is that this is not like 19999 all over again, where a lot of lousy companies were.
NEUT18|Sign these are good companies and their stocks should do fine over a very long term basis, but even the best companies in the world stocks and and the companies can be different sometimes.
BEAR19|And these ***** I've gotten ahead of themselves both an evaluation an on a technical basis and I think they could come down 15 or 20% over the next few months.
BEAR20|And that's going to scare people.
BULL21|And if you have some cash on the on the sidelines, you'll be able to take advantage of it.
