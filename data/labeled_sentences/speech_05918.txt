BULL0|"""Good morning guys."
NEUT1|So today wasn't nuts all day for me.
NEUT2|I know I'm not supposed to sell my winners on a wet day because of the green on the Red Day.
NEUT3|They will continue to run on the Green Day like if we have a Green Day tomorrow will continue to run but since current market conditions are so shaky and vital, I rather just hold the cash and wait for it to come back down.
NEUT4|I'm not kidding.
NEUT5|My assets to the rally and buy the dip.
NEUT6|Keep doing it until it doesn't work.
NEUT7|Anyways, I saw air BNB.
NEUT8|Shopify?
NEUT9|An item that Netflix ANSI limited.
NEUT10|Locked in profits on all of them will look to re-enter them soon.
NEUT11|Shopify is the one I didn't really want to sell.
NEUT12|It should one through 1100 sooner.
NEUT13|"We are going to mall."""
