BEAR0|"""Biggest high flying stocks yesterday was rocket companies which did have quite the rally and today it's down."
NEUT1|It's not about 18% to $34 a share and you tweet about the large short interest in the stock.
NEUT2|Yeah, I mean I don't even.
NEUT3|CBC said was 45% it.
NEUT4|I had it 38% from Bloomberg.
NEUT5|But what matters is that I don't know why people were shorted.
NEUT6|Now when you talk about this is a mean Wall Street bets talk.
NEUT7|I don't understand why people didn't buy puts on instead of being shorted an.
NEUT8|Immediately, that was contradicted by people who just think I just don't know.
NEUT9|ACTH options.
NEUT10|It was just a way to be able to limit your risk, but they didn't.
NEUT11|They were short, common, and because they were short comment, I'm sure that there were some firms that went bust yesterday.
NEUT12|We don't know who Anne.
NEUT13|We also don't know any names, unlike Melvin Capital, but we do know that it was a dumb short and the reason why is dumb shortcomings doing really well and it reported special dividend.
BULL14|They had great numbers and I could see that someone says with rates going up so much.
BULL15|Maybe they're going to do poorly, but the company demonstrated when they reported a quarter that when rates go up they still do fine.
NEUT16|So there was really no short thesis.
NEUT17|I mean, I can understand a short thesis engage in GameStop if you don't have a Ryan Cohen in there agitating.
BEAR18|It's entirely possible they would just continue to do what they were doing, which is to not do well.
BULL19|But when it comes to rocket, it was doing well.
NEUT20|So why were people you know what?
NEUT21|What is a great short case if rates are really going to hire, find something and maybe people are short, short rocket versus say long JPMorgan or something.
NEUT22|I'm thinking that.
NEUT23|You know, let's get rid of the.
NEUT24|That's only bet against the mortgage part, but it didn't work, and I think that people have to learn a lesson, which is that when you see a short that's just crowded, is this then the Wall Street bets people are going to go after you and I talked about this in the comments column.
NEUT25|R Wallstreetbets, a very powerful force.
BEAR26|So you you shouldn't be in a gang tackle short, you're going to lose money.
NEUT27|Yeah, in German got you covered from the short angle 'cause there's another angle to this story that I'm not sure is getting covered as much, but it's really murky right?
NEUT28|So a lot of the informational websites that you can go to to try to find what stocks are being talked about the most on Reddit wallstreetbets or you don't quite know where the sourcing is coming from, so you have to kind of dig through the Reddit thread yourself, but even then it's not quite certain where all these traders and all this interest came from in rocket is interesting, 'cause they were a couple of posts but not quite as many as the GameStop post that we continue to see on.
NEUT29|On the subreddit, all you have to do is follow my Twitter feed now other than the people who unfortunately had to block because they were scatological, people were pumping rocket endlessly like the UUWMC, which is another one that they're pumping.
NEUT30|Now they can say, well, listen jumping were just talking very positively about it and no different from any Wall Street analysts.
NEUT31|And they get that you could say that.
NEUT32|But I I was over when I was deluded with with.
NEUT33|With tweets about how Rocket was next, and that's what made me say on squawk on the street.
NEUT34|Well, you know it's got 38% short which is the number I knew and so I imagine people would go after it an did I start this absolutely not.
NEUT35|I just managed to see it.
NEUT36|And I feel strongly that when you see it, people going to act on it.
NEUT37|And so any started as a big short position for those who are watching.
NEUT38|"Cover your short OK, just covered 'cause I think that you're next."""
