NEUT0|"""Speaking of coronavirus, in the pandemic, Elon Musk might have coronavirus or he might not."
NEUT1|He he said he took a couple of rapid tests and he tweeted about it.
NEUT2|Of course, 'cause that's what he does.
BEAR3|He says something extremely bogus is going on, was tested for covid four times today.
NEUT4|Two tests came back negative, two came back positive, same machine, same test, same nurse, rapid antigen test from BD, which is probably referring to Becton Dickinson now couple of things with this.
NEUT5|First of all, why is it getting tested four times in one day, even if it's just the rapid test?
NEUT6|Second of all?
NEUT7|Of course, this test is not meant to be as accurate.
NEUT8|It's a quick test.
NEUT9|The PCR tests.
NEUT10|Is the gold standard test and that apparently Musk has also done and is waiting for the results to come back.
NEUT11|But you know, when you throw around words like bogus when you say that Hydroxychloroquine is an effective treatment for coronavirus, which Musk talked about earlier this year.
NEUT12|I mean the questions about this guy, stability as the CEO of a major company, as as much of an innovator as he might be.
NEUT13|They just don't go away.
NEUT14|And I think there are still relevant, and I think that the board needs to pay attention to this kind of stuff and shareholders need to be cognizant of it.
NEUT15|Anne, I think Julie you and I both know that's probably not going to change in the, you know, years ahead.
NEUT16|Elon Musk is exactly who he is and I think his fans and his investors love him for that.
NEUT17|"We'd expect nothing different from him there."""
