NEUT0|"""Stock market magic here."
NEUT1|So if you are a beginner and don't know what stock to buy, this is probably my number one beginner stock.
NEUT2|I would recommend investing in and this is a Coca Cola.
NEUT3|Now Coca Cola currently is trading for about $48.00 per share.
NEUT4|I actually have 20 shares of it right now.
NEUT5|My average prices are right around $40.
NEUT6|An if we look down here, we can see the.
NEUT7|52 Week high was at about $60.00 and 52 week low was right about $36.00.
NEUT8|So right now it's training or right in the middle about there an the dividend yield.
NEUT9|Right now if you buy it at $48.00 is a 3.482.
BULL10|So I like the stock because it's a pretty safe play.
NEUT11|Overall, Coca Cola's been in business for many, many years and they've been paying their dividends for many, many years there.
NEUT12|What's known as a dividend aristocrat?
NEUT13|Which means their dividend has been increasing every year an what they do is every quarter you will get a dividend based on how many shares you own.
NEUT14|It's usually around like let's say $0.50.
NEUT15|Per share.
NEUT16|Somewhere in that mark.
NEUT17|So if you had one share every quarter, you would get $0.50 for a total of $2.00 at the end of the year.
NEUT18|If you had, let's say, 10 shares, you'd get $5 every quarter.
NEUT19|So you'd have $50 at the end of the year, and it's just a relatively safe stock.
NEUT20|It doesn't have the highest dividend yield out there, but it's a.
NEUT21|It's a very non risky stock, so I definitely recommend it for beginners.
