NEUT2|Hi Rex War with The Motley Fool an if you know us.
NEUT3|You know how famous we are for finding these massive technological trends and then finding stocks that can benefit in an explosive way.
NEUT4|Stocks like Amazon and the E Commerce revolution.
BULL5|I recommendation up over 20,000% or Netflix in the streaming trend up 26,000% or booking Holdings and the online travel explosion up 7000%.
BULL6|All with our com long term diversified investing approach, we sleep well at night and we want you too as well.
NEUT7|So what are we seeing today that might be the next big world changing trend?
NEUT8|Well, it's 5G, which if our thesis holds up could be right here somewhere around this important inflection point.
BULL9|That would mean it's potentially poised to explode with opportunity, and I think it could be a great place to invest $1000 right now.
NEUT10|But of course you have to ask.
NEUT11|Well, which stock?
NEUT12|Well?
BULL13|One reason we feel 5G may be sitting in that inflection point is that Apple has now announced their first ever 5G iPhones, and that brings a technology most people have heard about finally into the mainstream.
BEAR14|So I think you could do a lot worse with your $1000 than investing it in Apple.
NEUT15|In fact, consider that a gift to you, a free stock pick that is a current recommendation, and many of our services.
NEUT16|But while you consider Apple.
NEUT17|Here is the twist and one that I think is great for small investors like us.
BULL18|Apple is up 2200% since David first recommended that Motley Fool members buy shares.
NEUT19|But here's the problem.
NEUT20|Apple is enormous.
NEUT21|Its market cap is over 1 1/2 trillion dollars.
BEAR22|It's very difficult for companies as large as Apple to Post Monster returns.
BULL23|Apple's market cap would have to grow to larger than the entire GDP of the United States if it were to increase another 2200%.
NEUT24|And that's why, again, even though we love Apple and it's a great, dependable company, there may be other stocks you want to consider as well.
NEUT25|And that brings me to the reason for this video today, investing Legends and Motley Fool Co.
NEUT26|Founders David and Tom Gardner just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now.
NEUT27|And Apple wasn't one of them.
NEUT28|David and Tom have a pretty good track record of picking trends before they get big.
NEUT29|Take a look at a few of the companies they picked to dominate their field.
NEUT30|If you'd invested your $1000 in each of those companies when they recommended them in stock advisor, you'd be sitting on 620, one $1185.
