NEUT0|"""Meanwhile, we're going to look at options inside right now."
NEUT1|She can give us some devil in the details.
NEUT2|She always does.
NEUT3|Abigail doolittle's.
NEUT4|Here we go will be looking at the potential for a Santa Claus rally.
NEUT5|We are, and we're doing that with Kevin Kelly of Benchmark Investments.
BULL6|And Kevin, you've had a great call here because throughout November, when there seemed like there was the possibility for a give back of the big rally, you were bullish.
NEUT7|And I think you were talking about the Santa Claus rally even back then.
NEUT8|So you think that we're going to be going higher right into the year end?
NEUT9|Do you think that we're taking a slow drift, higher or big rally?
NEUT10|Similar to November.
NEUT11|Well, if you take a step back and you look at the macro environment, you can see that earnings season is over.
NEUT12|Removing a lot of the volatility that may happen in some of the largest names as well as M&A is still on full force right?
NEUT13|The Slack acquisition for example, and then you can actually see that portfolio hedging and this is what I looked at back in November.
BULL14|It was really picking up from October 1st and you can see that through this skew index.
NEUT15|And so when you put those together on a macro basis, you have investors have already had.
NEUT16|And you've got a conducive macro environment, and that's why you're seeing the VIX down about 42% over the past month, right from 35 to about 20 now, and it's set to go lower, and one of the reasons why is we're seeing your end through the momentum names are from the options perspective set to take us higher because in different sectors you see these names and hitting 52 week highs and then also in the call space.
BULL17|Today, they're seeing at least double.
NEUT18|So if you look at UPS.
BULL19|Today alone, five times the amount of calls versus puts.
NEUT20|Tesla, you can actually see two times the amount of calls versus puts.
NEUT21|We know they're being added to the S&P 500.
NEUT22|You can go into the discretionary sector with Disney 2 1/2 times the amount of calls it got upgraded Moderna 2.4 times.
BULL23|So you're seeing a lot of bullish activity in the momentum names.
NEUT24|Yeah, and that does seem as though, especially since a lot of those names have big weightings to the index is, you know, talking again about that VIX holding on to that 20 level right now, in a way that's healthy becaused.
NEUT25|We do have stocks higher and for some of these reasons you're talking about.
NEUT26|On the other hand, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty there, so it makes sense that investors would want to continue to hedge.
BEAR27|So if we do go down to 15 on the VIX as you're talking about, would that be a warning signal?
BEAR28|No, it would not be a warning signal because of all the VIX is a signal for uncertainty, and so we're seeing VIX three months actually go down significantly as well.
BULL29|So not only is the short term 30 days volatility can press down, but also the three months is not seeing, so if there's a risk you're going to see it pick up in the VIX three months on the uncertainty that should lead, then VIX spot VIX higher.
NEUT30|So I don't.
BEAR31|I don't think that should be a warning sign at all.
NEUT32|Well, we will certainly be watching 3 month VIX and look forward to chatting about it.
NEUT33|With you again soon.
NEUT34|Kevin Kelly of Benchmark Investments.
BULL35|Thanks so much for joining us for options inside and from New York.
NEUT36|"This is Bloomberg."""
