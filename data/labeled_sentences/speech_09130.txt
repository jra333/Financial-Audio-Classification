NEUT0|"""I also asked Bill how he thought that investors should think about investing in green stocks and what kinds of returns they should expect."
NEUT1|Here's what Bill had to say.
NEUT2|When I invested in Impossible Foods or beyond meat or quantum scape, you know I was doing that just to help their role in climate.
BULL3|Now it looks like you know those will be 3 very successful companies and so you know I'll have more money to put into the top areas of climate.
NEUT4|Things like cement and steel breakthrough energy ventures is in 40 companies and so far you know there.
BULL5|Making progress, and even though some will fail, looks like we'll have, you know, quite a few successes there, and so you have to be willing to take high risk.
NEUT6|But if you do it in a tasteful way, the green economy is going to have you know more of them more than one Tesla.
NEUT7|Tesla CEO Elon Musk was recently on Joe Rogan's podcast and speculated that Bill Gates was shorting Tesla stock, so I asked Bill Gates to set the record straight.
NEUT8|I think what Elon stumbled Tesla is fantastic.
NEUT9|It's you know, probably the biggest single contribution to showing us that electric cars are part of how we solve climate change.
NEUT10|And now he's got a carbon removal challenge.
NEUT11|So we need more Elon Musks.
NEUT12|We need one for steel and cement and all the different categories.
NEUT13|So you're not sure Tesla stock just to work clear?
NEUT14|Yeah, I'm not.
NEUT15|I don't talk about my investments, but I think he should be very proud of what he's done.

NEUT17|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
