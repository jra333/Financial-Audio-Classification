BEAR0|"""Arca Goes Capitals fund meltdown burn banks like Nomura and Credit Suisse and founder Bill Wang, maintained a low profile with his investing, but questions now arising are rising about a mystery charity."
NEUT1|It's not going to be a mystery after you're finished here, Robert joins us now with more Robert Frank.
NEUT2|Well, we're we're going to.
NEUT3|Yeah, Joe, we're going to ask some more questions.
NEUT4|Bill Wong's charity.
NEUT5|It's called the Grace and Mercy Foundation.
NEUT6|It has about $500 million in assets that actually makes it one of the hundred largest foundations in the country.
NEUT7|Yet it is almost unknown in the broader charity world now.
BEAR8|The foundation's latest IRS filings show it purchased shares of several private offshore entities, all of which lost money.
NEUT9|It also had a large Morgan Stanley swap loss investment that lost $5 million.
NEUT10|Regulators say all of this is very unusual for charity.
NEUT11|He did donate one very profitable investment in Amazon, Andrew.
NEUT12|You'll like this one in 2018.
NEUT13|He gave the foundation.
NEUT14|Amazon shares worth $30 million.
BULL15|He bought them for just under $10 million, so that's $20 million gain.
NEUT16|But he not only avoided the capital gains on that 20 million, but he gets to deduct the gift to offset his income taxes.
NEUT17|Now the foundation had.
NEUT18|Over 16 millions in grants in 2018, so he's been very generous with this money, with 5.5 million going to the Fuller Foundation, 2,000,000 going to the Fuller Theological Seminary, 1.2 million to the Museum of the Bible.
NEUT19|Also, a lot of big gifts to schools in Englewood, NJ and Manhattan.
NEUT20|So look guys, we should be very clear.
NEUT21|This foundation $500 million.
BULL22|He has been extremely generous with this money.
NEUT23|Every year alot of questions though about the way it has invested is.
NEUT24|Assets, and whether those investments are related to or perhaps serving his family office investments.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT26|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
