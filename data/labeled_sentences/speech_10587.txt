NEUT0|"""I heard you talking to Becky a moment ago about this, this thing that's being built."
NEUT1|This discussion about the pandemic essentially being over basically by the end of April, yes and Matthew boss, JP Morgan's really kind of crystallizes everything.
NEUT2|Just saying it's time.
NEUT3|I mean, you gotta change what you're buying.
NEUT4|A lot of people come out this morning and talk about travel.
BULL5|Airlines upgraded, we've got hotels upgraded, we see a positive reaction to Royal Caribbean's and non earnings.

BEAR7|I know things are slow.
BULL8|I know what happened is terrible, but at the same time there's a Ryan Air Ryan air wants to start buying planes again because they feel very strongly coral that things are opening an we may be quite short, and if there's a boom, it's a remarkable mindset and I think it's a positive one.

NEUT18|He keeps talking about everybody is already making this investment, and yet the animals are just now starting to upgrade, so if anything, what you're seeing is the analyst playing catch up to the actual owners and buyers at the same time.
NEUT19|Obviously there's this undercurrent that I managed to witness as I was a do some recuperating.
NEUT20|Obviously we can't stop talking about read it and we can't stop talking about the revolution.
NEUT21|In part because it's concentrated in a couple of names everybody knows, so there's two threads going on.
NEUT22|There's the reopening thread, and then there's the threat which just says we're not letting the rich people hedge funds.
