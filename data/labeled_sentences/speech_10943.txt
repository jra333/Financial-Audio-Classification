BULL0|"""Intel, the world's top manufacturer of CPUs for computers and data centers, is often considered a solid tech stock with a stable dividend."
BEAR1|But in recent years until struggled with the loss of the growing mobile chip market to Qualcomm, longer computer upgrade cycles and hard competition from AMD.
NEUT2|Welcome to the Fifth Beast production channel.
NEUT3|I am not a financial advisor, Ann, please do your own due diligence when investing its expansions into new markets, including driverless cars, IO chips.
NEUT4|And memory chips also couldn't offset those weaknesses.
BEAR5|The escalation of the US and China trade War into a tech war also threatens to cause Intel headaches in China, where it generated 28% of its revenues last year in 2019 are those challenges Dominican tells.
NEUT6|Luster is a long term investment or will it overcome these challenges over the next few years?
BULL7|In 2019, Intel was the number one chipmaker by revenue, research firm Gartner said it regained the top spot after Samsung took the lead in 2017 and 2000.
NEUT8|Teen until had 15.7% market share last year.
BEAR9|Intel's chip revenue slipped zero point 7% year over year to $65.8 billion amid a semiconductor industry downturn.
BEAR10|Meanwhile, total worldwide semiconductor revenue fell 11.9% to $418.3 billion in 2019 until stock tanks on chip delay investors sold off until stock after the company disclosed a delay in production of seven nanometer scale processors.
BEAR11|The delay puts Intel further behind Chip Foundry Taiwan Semiconductor manufacturing, which is already mass producing chips at 5 nanometer scale.
NEUT12|Intel's current state of the art chips or at 10 nanometer scale circuit with Sun chips, are measured in nanometers, which are one billionth of a meter.
NEUT13|Smaller circuits translate to faster, more power efficient processors.
BULL14|Intel's rival Advanced Micro Devices AMD has been leveraging Taiwan Semiconductor's advanced process nodes to take market share in processors for computers and servers.
BULL15|Intel revenue from processors for datacenters soared 43% to $7.1 billion in the second quarter.
BULL16|Revenue from PC chips climbed 7% to $9.5 billion among Intel smaller businesses, memory chip sales jumped 76% to $1.7 billion.
NEUT17|It's important to understand the extent of Intel's dominance in this market until projects to do $75 billion in sales this year.
NEUT18|Global semiconductor sales are expected to be around $426 billion.
NEUT19|Intel therefore has 17.6% share of the global semiconductor market.
NEUT20|AMD, by comparison, has just 2% market share.
BEAR21|Bottom line on Intel stock until seven nanometer chip delay is bad news, but it's not a not deal breaker.
BULL22|Long-term Intel will be just fine.
NEUT23|I NTC stock price does not reflect this reality today.
BEAR24|Instead it reflects over pessimistic assumptions about Intel's long term growth trajectory.
NEUT25|The market will realize this over the next few quarters.
BULL26|As Intel sustains healthy growth despite the product delay as the market does realize this INTJ stock could rebound back to $60.00 by the end of the year.
BULL27|Thanks for watching and I would appreciate a subscribe as it truly helps the channel, especially with all the editing and animation.
NEUT28|"Takes a lot of time to create."""
