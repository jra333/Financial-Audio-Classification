BULL0|"""A slight miss this quarter, but still strong."
NEUT1|Of course, year over year in terms of gains, but let's just run through these numbers so revenue coming in at 125.6 billion.
BULL2|The forecast was for 119 spot 7 so a nice 5 billion beat there on the revenue line line and they're comfortable, almost doubling their EPS estimate.
NEUT3|The estimate was 723 came in at 1409.
NEUT4|Just going through the individual lines very quickly so a WS revenue is forecast at 12.8.
NEUT5|Came in at 12.7 international revenue.
NEUT6|Came in nicely ahead of forecasts 37.4 the forecast was 32.4 and North American also ahead, but just slightly 75.3 the forecast was 73.9 so it was really on North American international sales that was beat on the revenue line, particularly national as opposed to on the WSL and just looking at the guidance as well.
NEUT7|For Q1 revenue, guidance was expected to come in at 95.7 and they're giving a guide of 100 to 106 billion for Q1, so a nice beat there.
NEUT8|Going to be interesting as well, just Mike.
NEUT9|If I dig in a bit deeper to see whether the epsb has come through, but I wonder if it's covid costs not coming in quite as as high expected there forecasting 2 billion in covid costs for the for the first quarter.
NEUT10|Just gotta dig in and find that for the past quarter.
NEUT11|But either way, strong beat on the top line and very much on the bottom right, yeah?
NEUT12|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT13|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
