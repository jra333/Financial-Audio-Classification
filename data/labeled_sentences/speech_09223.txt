NEUT0|"""An you know gold is except last Thursday or Wednesday."
NEUT1|I can't recall.
BEAR2|I mean it's not market falls out a bit in Bitcoin drops 5%.
NEUT3|Yeah, it's not going to be that it's not going to be without volatility.
NEUT4|You know, we're still a very young asset, but I see.
NEUT5|People looking at that as where I can store money in a world where there's, you know, from Zimbabwe to Venezuela to Iran you're still on this store value kick as opposed to Bitcoin it would not Bitcoin but crypto and probably ether and everything else.
NEUT6|Greece with the wheels of the next generation economy.
NEUT7|That's web 3.0.
NEUT8|I really think the rest of its Web 3.0.
NEUT9|I'm 100% certain that at one point we're going to have Web 3.0.
NEUT10|I'm far less certain when that is and.
NEUT11|Of of those, you know EOS ether hashgraph definitie neo of the 100 odd blockchains, how they're going to fit together to create Web 3.0 is 1.
NEUT12|Going to win or multiple goin.
NEUT13|So until then it's a scarcity play.
NEUT14|So bitcoins are scarce and play the other ones you deliver.
NEUT15|Gotta watch it.
NEUT16|Who's getting adoption?
NEUT17|Who's building community?
NEUT18|Write a theory is still the market leader.
NEUT19|They have the most developers on it, but there's plenty of really cool technologies with money behind them.
NEUT20|Micura macro man at heart.
NEUT21|I want to talk about for a moment about the markets.
NEUT22|You can't ignore them when you're thinking about Bitcoin and you still run a macro trading operation.
NEUT23|It's true outside Galaxy Digital from not mistaken.
NEUT24|So if you look at the S&P 527 sixty five, roughly the 10 year at 3:15, high yield spreads at 3:50 over dollar index is 95.
NEUT25|I could go on.
NEUT26|What does that tell you?
NEUT27|You know, I think listen, we've had a unbelievable run for nine years now in equity markets.
BEAR28|Breath is getting narrower narrower.
NEUT29|Trump's got a big election coming.
NEUT30|My instinct is he gets beaten badly in the house, but even if he doesn't get beaten badly, even if he just gets beaten the Trump trade, which drove this last run out, is degraded a bunch 'cause he's going to have a house that's going after him, like little Chihuahua dogs, nonstop barking investigations, and so his ability to get anything done.
BEAR31|We go right into the 2020 election, so I think you're losing.
BULL32|Political support for the market.
NEUT33|If you look at the rate charts, 350 looks like next step and then 4%, right?
BEAR34|We've got inflation showing up.
NEUT35|You look at Amazon just did raising their own minimum wage.
NEUT36|Everyone's going to be forced to push that way.
BULL37|Oil prices going towards 100 oil.
NEUT38|What's the right trade and so short rates short stocks?
BULL39|I think we put in a cycle high in equities will see that's a big call.
NEUT40|I could be wrong but you know it feels that way.
BEAR41|And so the stock market looks very vulnerable right now and.
NEUT42|You know, I think short stocks and short rates is the right trade.
NEUT43|Certainly going through the election and then after so it didn't feel last week like in next election, nervousness.
NEUT44|Let's call it was the catalyst for the sell off.
NEUT45|Know what's it going to be?
NEUT46|There was rates the caliph?
NEUT47|Yes it was right?
NEUT48|Sure, an I think you're going to just throw those two things.
NEUT49|You have oil.
NEUT50|You got rates.
NEUT51|You got the election.
NEUT52|There's no way the election unless Trump wins the house.
NEUT53|If the Republicans win the House and then I changed my mind, I just don't see it happening.
BULL54|Maybe they're going to do a little bit better in the Senate, but I have a feeling you're going to see the blue wave show up.
BEAR55|And so I think he loses the house.
BEAR56|"You lose the political support that you've had for this market."""
