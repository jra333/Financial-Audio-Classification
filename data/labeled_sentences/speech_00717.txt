NEUT0|"""Alright guys will start back on the video today."
NEUT1|Will be talking about Tesla ticker symbol, TSLA.
NEUT2|And just a reminder.
NEUT3|And none of this ever make a medication to buy yourself anything.
NEUT4|This is for educational purposes only, just showing you guys what I'm doing.
NEUT5|I'm looking at the stock and how I'm going about it, so don't trade anything you see or hear on these videos.
NEUT6|And yes, people have asked me.
NEUT7|I do show you guys and a paper shade account.
NEUT8|But everything I say I am doing on my real account.
NEUT9|But I just don't show my actual place, but I will start doing that.
NEUT10|If you guys want to see that.
NEUT11|So today I'm talking about Tesla.
NEUT12|Tesla has been trading sideways as you see, after this move up it did tray sideways.
NEUT13|Then I had to pop.
BULL14|I am looking forward to this pop.
BULL15|This is around $40 pop up that so I'm looking forward to for the next two days my support level.
NEUT16|My support level was around 6:10.
NEUT17|My support levels around 6:10 around here.
BEAR18|I didn't want to go pricing below that since Monday, so from Monday I was watching it to see the price went below 610 and it didn't.
BEAR19|It did today but it quickly rejected that price so I am still bullish on that if it would have fell below and had a decent move down like something like this or even something like this job and kind of stayed below it then I would have became bearish for lower prices but it didn't help that support line.
BEAR20|So I am still bullish on Tesla.
NEUT21|My entry price for Tesla is 620, so if it gets a 620 I will get in on a call option and I will hold for newer highs.
NEUT22|'cause I do think so.
NEUT23|Have a good pop either.
NEUT24|Tomorrow are the day of when it goes into the S&P 500.
NEUT25|But if not, then I do think it would happen next week, but I do think it will be this week.
BEAR26|But if it does break that 610 level and starts going down, I will not be playing Tesla.
NEUT27|I would just be watching it.
NEUT28|So maybe get a quick Skype opportunity.
NEUT29|But so those are my entries and exits.
BULL30|Entry 622 newer highs.
NEUT31|Or if it goes below 610, I'll just be waiting.
BULL32|Also, I've been looking at this sideways range and a big range is coming soon as been a tighter range bound motion right now.
BULL33|And also when I get in at 6:20 I wanted to break the 6:50 resistance level and then once it breaks that I think we are good to go for newer highs to the Big 700 figure.
NEUT34|That is my ultimate price target for Tesla 700 big figure.
NEUT35|An I am also watching RSI and the news on Tesla, but I do think it is bullish.
