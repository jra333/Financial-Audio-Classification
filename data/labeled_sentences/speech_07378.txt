NEUT0|"""It's playing this weird video chart on ticker symbol X."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, another very eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|Big price movement and you look down here big volume, some more of the story, a lot of eyeballs watching this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
BULL8|Nearly one make this chart look the absolute best going forward, and that would be the price can continue to hold right up there above 2535.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 2535.
BULL10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage to actually stay above that level, that would certainly be a very impressive sign of strength moving forward.
NEUT11|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT12|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT13|The 50.
NEUT14|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher and which is very helpful because when it comes just gauging the overall health of the move.
NEUT15|That right there have been defined as quote, unquote, the move.
NEUT16|Just watch that Purple Line as long as the price stays above that line, as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health.
NEUT17|The Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|His visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yes and above that level at 2535 would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT21|First level going to be right here in the near term at the 2650 mark and then after 2650.
NEUT22|Nothing fancy or complicated behind that or the fact that you know just where the party momentum finally stopped today.
NEUT23|That was essentially up there at 2750.
NEUT24|So keep running those couple of roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT25|But All in all, any angle you look at it, very impressive movement, and as long as the price keeps on building those higher bases, that is by far what matters most.
NEUT26|So let's see how this one plays out on Thursday.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT29|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT32|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR33|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT36|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
