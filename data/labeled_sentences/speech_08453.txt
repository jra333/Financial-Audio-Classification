NEUT0|"""Hi guys, so these are two pairs that I have got in."
BULL1|I did hit three I got two on *****.
NEUT2|Anyways, I hit 2 on Dixon.
NEUT3|I hit one on JD Sports.
NEUT4|It was too actually on JD Sports, but one of them did get cancelled, but persistence is key.
NEUT5|We got three pairs last year.
NEUT6|I did hit on the 3:50 non reflective statics.
NEUT7|I got two pairs and I got one static reflective so two years in a row we hit in.
BULL8|We hit in on these limited edition.
NEUT9|Not so limited easy, but without further ado, let's get right to the resale predictions.
NEUT10|So right now the prices are looking around three 5360 to 400 depending on your size.
NEUT11|I know that eight and a half is like around 360 right now, 12 1/2, which is what I got.
NEUT12|Is around the 400 range.
NEUT13|So like I said, depending on your size, base sizes are also doing very well, but where do I see these going?
NEUT14|I do see these staying around.
NEUT15|360 yeah, like 360 to the 4:50 range for the first three months on.
BULL16|I won't see a dramatic increase in these, but I do suggest if you want to invest in these, these will go up.
NEUT17|These will go up.
NEUT18|Mainly people that cops or some manual users and bot users by users cooked the ******* release date.
NEUT19|Took so much stock.
NEUT20|Was there 500K worldwide that I do not know but the demand is there for this issue.
NEUT21|So obviously it's a black easy.
NEUT22|The material is nice.
NEUT23|Who wouldn't want?
NEUT24|You can literally wear this with.
NEUT25|Anything is very nice.
NEUT26|You personally I think I'm going to keep the eight and a half.
NEUT27|I have a 10 and a half in a 12 1/2 that I'm planning on holding, but if you do plan on selling now, go ahead and make your money.
BULL28|I do see these going up though.
BULL29|I'd give it a full year to actually see a great percentage increase on these, but these will go up.
NEUT30|So if you want to go ahead and stock up on pairs.
NEUT31|Go ahead and do that.
NEUT32|You're not wasting any money, but let me know down below in the comments section below.
NEUT33|If y'all took a W, how many pairs did you hit?
BEAR34|Did you get unlucky?
NEUT35|Let me know if y'all think that the easy supply drop was a little wack.
NEUT36|'cause honestly.
NEUT37|I didn't even get through once what, but yeah, let me know if you guys are keeping this for the personal or y'all investing in these.
NEUT38|Also, one thing to note on the new pairs they did add this little like string to it.
NEUT39|So if you're looking to buy pairs, make sure that the pairs have this little material thing right here just to be on the safe side.
NEUT40|You're legit check.
NEUT41|Make sure the boost isn't very hard.
NEUT42|Check the insoles, check the prime mating along the shoe.
NEUT43|Make sure everything is good.
NEUT44|But yeah, without further ado guys, if y'all like the video let me know.
NEUT45|Invest in these papers.
NEUT46|I'm telling you I probably won't.
NEUT47|'cause I have $3000 worth in merchandise that I still need to move.
NEUT48|So if I had the capital.
NEUT49|Invest in these.
BULL50|"But yeah, thank you guys so much for watching and I'll see you guys next time, peace."""
