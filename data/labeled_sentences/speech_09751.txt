NEUT0|"""Hey guys, back looking at some more stocks and today I'm looking at forward and it looks like we kind of got a break out and right now I'm on the monthly which is a giant time frame."
NEUT1|But let's put some trendlines going.
NEUT2|Let's put some trendlines up.
NEUT3|There's the top and the bottom.
BULL4|And as you can see, we broke this trend line going.
NEUT5|Upwards, and now we're floating above this moving average.
NEUT6|Let's go closer.
NEUT7|Let's go to the daily.
BULL8|The daily looks good too.
NEUT9|So if we go back to the monthly.
NEUT10|I mean, this is a big pattern, so I would say probably.
NEUT11|Outside right there with the world, the volume is maybe even closer.
NEUT12|Maybe someone right here.
NEUT13|And then maybe measure this from here to here.
NEUT14|Possible target could be 3167.
NEUT15|Which is a possible?
NEUT16|162%.
NEUT17|So.
NEUT18|Yeah, but this is actually a really long time frame.
NEUT19|If you look at when this goes back to it's in.
NEUT20|Not 1989 so.
BULL21|We could see a bull run for forward for.
NEUT22|I mean, we could.
NEUT23|Let's see if.
NEUT24|Let's see if we can.
NEUT25|Go higher, here's some levels that we have to break.
NEUT26|We definitely have to break this one.
NEUT27|We might get.
NEUT28|Will get resistance right here, and it might even reverse right there, but.
NEUT29|Let's see what else?
NEUT30|OK, let's go to the.
NEUT31|Let's check out the ribbons.
BULL32|Yeah, this is looking really good.
NEUT33|That's on the monthly.
NEUT34|We're on the daily.
NEUT35|Let me put up some trendlines on the daily.
NEUT36|So we got something like that.
NEUT37|And then something like that.
NEUT38|And now something like.
BEAR39|That but since this break out, it's already.
NEUT40|20%.
NEUT41|But I think that about does it if you want to keep up to date on these stock videos so you don't have to watch the charts yourself, hit subscribe button.
NEUT42|And if you like it, hit the thumbs up.
BULL43|"Other than that, have a great day."""
