NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol BCRX."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So a lot of eyeballs on this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that will be the price could say appear above 1115.
NEUT8|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 1115.
BULL9|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage the above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT10|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT11|That is where the purple line here comes into play.
NEUT12|The 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average keyword definitely moving.
NEUT14|I get it.
NEUT15|The price is way appear that lines way down here, but as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move.
NEUT16|That right there had been defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch that purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT19|His visualize that.
NEUT20|That is what is being presented against your staying above 1115 would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100% owned the chart as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT21|For this, going to squeeze down the chart here a little bit to offer up a bit more context, because as you're seeing here, it has been a long time since the price has been up this high.
NEUT22|In fact, why don't we do this?
NEUT23|Why don't we just go to the daily timeframe?
NEUT24|'cause that's how long it's been?
NEUT25|We're going to go to the daily.
NEUT26|Oh wow, or maybe I'm just going to call this a Blue Sky breakout.
NEUT27|Go a little bit more.
NEUT28|Oh wow, yeah now there?
BEAR29|OK there we go we are at multi year highs so this was this is always a good problem to have when it takes you this long to go back and find previous areas of resistance.
NEUT30|But next key area resistance moving forward and be right there at 1285 and then after 1285 next key level up there at 14.
NEUT31|So keep around those couple roadblocks moving forward.
NEUT32|But on all monster movement today.
NEUT33|It'll be interesting to see how this one continues to play out on the week.
NEUT34|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT35|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT36|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT37|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT38|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL39|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT40|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT41|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR42|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT43|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT44|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
