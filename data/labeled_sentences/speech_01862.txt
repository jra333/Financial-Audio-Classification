NEUT0|"""Cardano price prediction for August."
NEUT1|Before we start comment of the day goes to Vasant Mot High October.
NEUT2|How high Ada can go in three months.
NEUT3|Thank you for the question.
NEUT4|I answer that in a moment, newcomers and returning guest please leave a comment below.
NEUT5|It may appear in a future video.
NEUT6|Don't forget to subscribe and click the notification Bell.
BULL7|It helps me out tremendously.
NEUT8|Nothing I say should be taken as financial advice.
NEUT9|I'm just a cartoon robot.
NEUT10|Do your own research before making any investment decisions.
NEUT11|With that said, let's begin.
BULL12|I foresee Cardano hitting $0.50 by the end of August.
NEUT13|Am mathematical formula was not used to come to this price point either.
NEUT14|I'm a fundamental investor looking at coinmarketcap.com we see a lot of volume and that is due to the anticipation of the Shelley mainnet launch Virtual Summit, a possible Coinbase listing and fear of inflation.
BULL15|This builds my case for the bullish outlook.
NEUT16|For Cardano I believe this project is a long term investment with staking being available to the general public by summer's end.
BEAR17|We could see a drastic uptrend in price.
NEUT18|Some investors will profit, but the vast majority will remain in the ecosystem.
NEUT19|Let's say for arguments sake that the Shelley mainnet is pushed back.
BEAR20|Then I foresee a temporary dumping price, how low it may go depends on the cryptocurrency, market conditions, the global stock market is overvalued and artificially inflated by the Federal Reserve.
BEAR21|There is a disconnect from reality with current market trends, with unemployment rising and the Federal Reserve creating more Fiat money, we find out.
NEUT22|Global economy on life support.
BULL23|I'm very confident on the development speed at which Cardano is moving slow and steady now.
NEUT24|This concludes the video.
NEUT25|I'm Kapri the Cyborg.
BULL26|"Thank you for tuning into October talks goodbye."""
