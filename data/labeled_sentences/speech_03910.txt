NEUT0|"""Retiring early sounds like a fantasy right?"
NEUT1|Plenty of people are living that dream right now.
NEUT2|Hi, I'm Andrea Coombes with MarketWatch.
NEUT3|A key question is how should you invest the early retirees I've spoken to embrace a simple strategy.
NEUT4|Invest in a diversified mix of low cost index mutual funds.
NEUT5|First you need an asset allocation plan.
NEUT6|What percentage of savings do you want in stocks versus bonds?
NEUT7|One conservative rule of thumb, invest 100 minus your age and stocks a 40 year old would invest 60% stocks.
NEUT8|40% bonds that assumes you'll stay invested until retirement to avoid rating that money early.
NEUT9|Put six months to a year of salary in a liquid account.
NEUT10|Next diversification.
NEUT11|Keep it simple by mimicking MarketWatch is lazy portfolios.
NEUT12|Take Doctor Bernstein's no brainer portfolio.
NEUT13|You may not have access to these four Vanguard funds in a 401K, but you're likely to have similar funds from other companies.
NEUT14|Or consider a low cost target date fund.
NEUT15|These mutual funds invest in.
NEUT16|Other funds and manage your asset allocation.
NEUT17|You pay for that convenience.
NEUT18|So compare fees.
NEUT19|Finally monitor investments to make sure your allocations don't get out of whack.
NEUT20|If, say, U.S. stocks make big gains, you may need to re balance and push some money towards bonds.
NEUT21|Remember, all financial markets get volatile.
NEUT22|Keep your eye on the long term.
NEUT23|"People with diversified portfolios who stayed in the market during the 2809 crisis they made their money back and then some in San Francisco and raccoons."""
