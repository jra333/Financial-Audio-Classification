BULL0|"""Dave, it's good to talk to you today."
BULL1|Thanks for joining us.
NEUT2|Thank you.
BEAR3|Trade wars escalating.
NEUT4|There's no doubt about that.
NEUT5|Where does it leave us?
NEUT6|I think it leaves in the bog of uncertainty and it's very difficult.
NEUT7|I think that justify valuations of the stock market that are above historical norms in the context of this trade war, economic war with China entering into a whole new chapter, I think that's the story right now is a re rating of risk.
NEUT8|Yeah, how big of a risk you think that is that what we've had is a trade war now becomes with the currency cocktail mixed in.
NEUT9|Well, I think that you've got a bunch of things we went into the year with a lot of hope to 'cause this multiple driven rally.
BULL10|We thought there'd be a trade deal with China.
NEUT11|That's not happening.
NEUT12|We thought we'd get a smooth Brexit that's not happening.
NEUT13|Sarah mentioned earlier about the both of the the Powell Pivot well with all deference.
NEUT14|That was seven months ago.
NEUT15|If anything, just sell off started early last week and actually continued into Wednesday and Thursday 'cause the Fed Bangla.
NEUT16|His communications, I mean that, was what you call a hawkish cut last week of the Fed meeting, so the Fed again bungled this communication skills yet again.
NEUT17|So this confluence of factors and then what's happening in Hong Kong right now the trade war between Japan and between South Korea.
NEUT18|I mean you're getting this sense right now for the first time the stock market is seeing what I've been seeing, which is a global economy that's really starting to Splinter apart.
BULL19|And we're also starting to see the data turn.
BEAR20|David, I think importantly, I mean today's ISM non manufacturing was lower than expected.
BEAR21|There were pockets in the jobs report and I know you've been talking about this stuff for awhile.
NEUT22|So when you see the 10 year US, 10 year 174, how much weakness is reflected there?
NEUT23|And how low could we be going?
NEUT24|Or are we going to be talking about negative rates in this country?
NEUT25|Well, I'll tell you the charts don't lie and there's just dead air between where we are now in the 10 year note all the way down to a 135 where you were.
NEUT26|Back just after Brexit in 2016 and when you look at US bond yields in conjunction with where they are globally, you know the US Treasury market is the tall man standing.
NEUT27|You know I'm looking right now with three other things, inversion of yield curves and three big countries.
BEAR28|the US, Germany and Japan is back to inversion with negative rates.
NEUT29|Those are three of the four biggest economies on the planet, and it's telling you that the risks of a global recession and of course that's being embedded in the price of copper too.
BEAR30|Those recession risks globally, not just in the US, are rising inexorably right now, and this is not just what happened between Trump and the unexpected 10% tariff on China, but nobody really expected that China was going to retaliate this quickly.
BULL31|"David Rosenberg thanks for phoning in."""
