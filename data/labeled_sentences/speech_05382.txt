NEUT0|"""Let's get to the stocks on our radar in our man behind the glass, Steamboat is going to hit you with a question."
NEUT1|Jason Mosier up first, what are you looking at this week?
NEUT2|Yeah, we talked about Home Depot this week.
BEAR3|I'm looking at Lowe's ticker LOW next week with earnings looking back to August.
BEAR4|The stock is certainly pulled back a little bit since then since they've announced store closures.
NEUT5|Clarified a bit more on strategy with new CEO Marvin Ellison.
NEUT6|I do like this market in general.
BULL7|I think the home improvement market is a is a tremendous one that should continue to overtime just.
BULL8|Get better and I do think that Marvin Ellison has a lot of good ideas and has the opportunity to take this business in a good direction.
BEAR9|Pullback in shares here over the last few months is a bit more compelling.
NEUT10|I think today Steve question about Lowe's.
NEUT11|Just one business have a competitive advantage over the other.
BULL12|Yeah, I think generally speaking we look to Home Depot as the leader in the space.
NEUT13|The store base is very similar right?
BULL14|They both have the same number of stores essentially, but Home Depot has just been better when it comes to customer service.
NEUT15|When it comes to serving the pro side of the business as well as the do-it-yourself, hers and I think that's really where where Marvin Ellison is trying to take this business in.
BULL16|Lowe's getting better on the customer service side, making sure they have what you want.
NEUT17|Aaron Bush.
NEUT18|What are you looking at this week?
NEUT19|I'm looking at take two interactive ticker TT WL.
NEUT20|They just two weeks ago or so had the biggest entertainment launch of all time.
NEUT21|Red Dead Redemption Two made over $750 million in three days.
BEAR22|And the stock is down over 20% from its highs.
NEUT23|And so I mean take two.
NEUT24|I mean they're turning into a video game giant with tons of success is Red Dead?
NEUT25|Isn't the only thing that they have you know, a few years ago people were saying Grand Theft Auto was, you know, I think they had.
BULL26|So between more games, higher margins, more recurring revenues, lots of catalysts, the timing feels pretty compelling.
NEUT27|Steve question about take two.
NEUT28|So I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 2 right now.
NEUT29|Is there too much story in this thing?
NEUT30|It's not a movie, it's taking forever.
NEUT31|I just skip all these scenes.
NEUT32|It's crazy town.
BULL33|I mean, I think that's a good thing.
NEUT34|I think what they want is for people to get sucked into the world so that when Red Dead Online comes out in a month or so, that people will want to stick with it and pay them more money.
NEUT35|Steve, are you a good cowboy or a bad cowboy?
BEAR36|I'm pretty bad right now.
NEUT37|Matter, what are you looking at?
NEUT38|I'm glad Erin said take two interactive.
NEUT39|I'm glad Isaac, who wrote us.
NEUT40|The email had Activision Blizzard on his list because my stocks on my radar going to video game stocks.
NEUT41|So Activision Blizzard ticker ATVI, Electronic Arts EA Aaron had take two at TTW.
BEAR42|Oh, and also Ubi soft, which is on the pink sheets that UBS FY, depending on which stock you look at, these things are down 20 to 30% yet and I'm sure Aaron agrees these are companies with tremendous tailwinds.
NEUT43|It's an industry I love and I can't believe they're down as much as they are, but if you need if you only video games, this is your great.
BULL44|A great chance to do so.
NEUT45|Steve.
NEUT46|I think I'm going to take two.
NEUT47|I'm just having so much fun.
BULL48|"Got in a grand old time."""
