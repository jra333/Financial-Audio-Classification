NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
NEUT1|Today will be looking at your JPY on the daily chart.
BEAR2|So zooming in, we can see that your JPY is trailing the Upper Bollinger Band after the bounce of the 117 handle positive sentiment also displayed in the short term oscillators has injured from the 42 month low of 114.423.
BEAR3|Extending the pair above the established mostly bearish simple moving averages, although intact, appears positive, momentum appears to be under negative stress.
NEUT4|Thus, I retracement cannot be ruled out.
BEAR5|A continued climb could encounter initial restrictions from the Upper Bollinger Band at 120.46 ahead of the key highs of 121.13 and 121.38.
BULL6|So passing these obstacles could send the pair to meet the 122.03 resistance before the Bulls challenge the six and a half month high of 122.86 to the downside, support may commence from the 200 day SMAP at 119.34 and the inside swing high of 119.03.
NEUT7|A step underneath could rest at the 118.52 barrier where the 100 day SMAD also is located should sell astyr lower the 117.48 area where the 50 days in May.
NEUT8|In the Mid Bollinger Band reside could come into focus.
BEAR9|That said, a violation of the 117 hurdle could drive the price towards a 115.32 truf increasing worries of resuming.
NEUT10|The bigger bearish trend.
BULL11|In brief, the very short term neutral to bullish picture maintains optimism.
BULL12|Yet a break above 122.86 could upgrade the short and medium term outlook to bullish.
NEUT13|That's it for me.
BULL14|"Have a great trading day."""
