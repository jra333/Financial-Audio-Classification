BULL0|"""Hey guys Frank Curzio another live video this whole time but I love your feedback."
BEAR1|Frank Cruz research.com you guys now have been negative on Disney for awhile and I just saw them report earnings after the close.
NEUT2|So you get a lot of emails and stuff like that so wanted to break it down because disease results.
NEUT3|He is a stock that went from 72 a little bit over 100 you know so I thought considering that move that you you need to report pretty good numbers to support that move and isn't exactly exactly opposite.
BULL4|They beat on revenues and actually said that direct to Consumer International revenues for the quarter increased from 1.1 billion to 4.1 billion, which includes the assets for 20th Century Fox.
BEAR5|But segment operating was increased from 385 million to 812 million, so they said they increase operating losses due to cost associated with the launch of Disney Plus and consolidation of Hulu.
NEUT6|So basically with this company is telling you the more subscribers and adds to their Disney, plus the more money they get.
NEUT7|Old is right and that happens in streaming across the board.
NEUT8|So this is a business that they're not going to make money for very long time, even if they have 150,000,000 subscribers.
NEUT9|I mean put down perspective, they expected to spend 5 billion for new content when?
NEUT10|Netflix has 180,000,000 subscribers and spending $17 billion this year in content.
NEUT11|So you need to spend a ton of money.
NEUT12|And again, this is an industry that just never made sense to me in terms of for us, it's great streaming for, but to make money on this business that has no pricing power and everybody's rushing in, I get why Disney is doing that because they want that constant revenue stream that Disney gets Comcast guests from wireless and things and they don't really have that.
NEUT13|So that leaves the rest of their division which is park switches, theaters and none of it.
NEUT14|I mean, none of that stuff is open.
NEUT15|And not only that, when it does open.
BEAR16|The traffic is going to be so much less so they reported.
BEAR17|They missed earnings by 40%.
NEUT18|I mean it was kind of a kitchen sink thing when ninety cents.
BEAR19|What was the number they brought all the way down, they earned $0.60 for the quarter, which puts their PE forward PE this year at 44 times I've never seen a P for a company that high for a company that's not growing and not expected to grow in the next two years at least.
NEUT20|So it doesn't matter, right?
NEUT21|That's what all this was doesn't matter, because you know, today you get rewarded for the more.
NEUT22|Crappie report that the better it is for your sake, you should buy it.
BEAR23|If you remove guided, you get rewarded compared to someone who just lowers their guidance and and actually gives a forecast of 2020, which is insane when you think about it.
NEUT24|But for Disney a lot going on under the hood here.
NEUT25|I mean they can't hide it no more.
NEUT26|They're losing lots of money right now, so let's see how this plays out again.
BEAR27|Hate Disney personally, just incredibly overvalued.
BEAR28|This is a stock that could decrease for 50%.
NEUT29|Still be one of the most expensive stocks in the Dow.
NEUT30|So just be careful with this name.
NEUT31|I don't see reason to buy.
NEUT32|It's gonna be interesting to see what the analysts say about it when they come out.
NEUT33|Conference call is probably gonna take.
NEUT34|It starts in a little while, about 4-5 minutes.
NEUT35|I'm going to be listening to it.
NEUT36|It's going to be interesting to see how they even keep the dividend for this thought, but let's see, we'll see tomorrow.
BULL37|Based on this market, it should be up 20% tomorrow, so we'll see.
BEAR38|But all seriousness, and I think this is a lot of trouble.
BEAR39|Again, have a bad few quarters and I don't think it's pricing the stock trading over 144 times for drinks.
NEUT40|Frank Curzio is always protect.
NEUT41|You guys.
NEUT42|"Take care."""
