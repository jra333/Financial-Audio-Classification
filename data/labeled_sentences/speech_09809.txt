NEUT0|"""Welcome to the market Moon Lord, where we merge the matrix, but the stars I'm your host Jason Alexander, the blue Moon of Neptune here to help you navigate through."
NEUT1|The illusions of life.
NEUT2|Hey, what's up guys?
NEUT3|Welcome to the market Moon Lord, we're going to continue our series on Moon phasing trading and today I'm going to go over AMC an G Me and it's very interesting was coming up here.
NEUT4|We can see, you know, as the full moon approaches the stock market or the stock started going up the full moons right here, by the way, and we know the full moon energy really starts building, building, building and then we have the climax.
BULL5|OK so we can see that the stocks were building building building.
NEUT6|Had a little dip and then another full moon and then the climax.
NEUT7|OK, so typically a full moon is, you know the ending, the milestone, the climax, right?
NEUT8|And so I was thinking that was the peak, but as I looked deeper and deeper deeper I do see some interesting things we saw after the full moon they started to go down.
BULL9|But guys I think we're going to see serious reversal.
NEUT10|We can clearly see Mata see that happening and it's in an in the pre market today and I kind of want to go over why that could be happening.
NEUT11|Regarding astrology, so if we look over here we have a new moon on the 11th of February.
NEUT12|I think that's going to be a very interesting day.
NEUT13|But today we have a. Eclipse and Moon, which is the moon of reflecting of all the things we've been doing.
NEUT14|It's like the end of the energy of the full moon.
NEUT15|And then on the tomorrow as a last quarter moon.
NEUT16|And that's about letting go.
NEUT17|OK last quarter moons or about letting go and getting ready for the new moon.
NEUT18|But the thing about tomorrow is the moon is going to be reaching is debilitated position and Scorpio.
NEUT19|During this last quarter an opposite of Mars in Taurus.
NEUT20|OK, so basically since the moon.
NEUT21|Is in the opposite place that does best.
BEAR22|It does worse here, and it does the exact opposite.
NEUT23|Kind of.
NEUT24|So scorpios.
NEUT25|They really struggle with letting go, so I actually see today or tomorrow.
NEUT26|Excuse me on the last quarter, moon as a day of where we are supposed to let go, but we double down in the same with the hedge funds.
NEUT27|Potentially OK, but you know, is opposite of Mars in Taurus and Uranus a Taurus?
NEUT28|Worse breaking down the structures that were built before?
BULL29|So this is looking very bullish for reversal ANAN.
NEUT30|GME, an an AMC for tomorrow.
NEUT31|Another thing I want to bring up is we are entering the purge cycle of this full moon or this moon, and that pretty much means the moon is closest to the earth today.
NEUT32|OK, and during these times we do see when this furthest away and when it's closest away we see a lot of changes in the stock market best today and then we have 1/4 moon tomorrow.
NEUT33|So guys, if you're not in.
NEUT34|One of these stocks I do suggest getting into him because today is a major turning point and tomorrow will be an even bigger turning point and I think whatever direction we go today and tomorrow is going to tell us what is going to happen.
NEUT35|So I'm very excited for this.
NEUT36|I'm going to be following the moon cycles for these stocks and guys.
NEUT37|Don't forget to comment like and subscribe.
NEUT38|And yeah guys, until next time I'm excited.
NEUT39|Don't forget the bodies.
NEUT40|Jason Alexander.
