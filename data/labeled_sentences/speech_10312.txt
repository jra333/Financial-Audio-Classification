BEAR0|"""Starbucks and Coke announcing pauses in their social media buys of the latest actions against companies like Facebook and Twitter."
NEUT1|Similar actions, of course, over the last couple of days, from Diageo from Hershey, Jim, you name it Coke, Pepsi, Unilever.
NEUT2|I mean, we're not.
NEUT3|We're no longer just talking about Ben and Jerry's no.
NEUT4|My candidly by my travel trust his own this stock for years and we're doing some selling why well?
NEUT5|Because even though JP Morgan says that earnings are not at risk.
NEUT6|When you're not one of those companies and you advertise and then you're going to get on the case.
NEUT7|Those companies represent more than just what I regard as being left wing companies, and I think that Twitter even more at risk for the numbers.
NEUT8|David, I've got to tell you that corporate America has changed.
NEUT9|Corporate America is trying to get ahead of what the social issues are in this country that matter.
NEUT10|I think it's rather amazing.
NEUT11|My personal convictions don't mean much on this other than the fact that I am stunned that the companies that I'd never thought had a.
NEUT12|Let's say I.
NEUT13|Cared that much are lining up against these guys.
NEUT14|A look.
NEUT15|Of course I'm looking at is is Ben and Jerry's going to do it?
NEUT16|Of course by Patagonia.
NEUT17|Yeah, but she's these other guys.
NEUT18|Verizon Honda, Hurst, David.
NEUT19|These are like mainstream companies that never really expressed much interest about these things.
BEAR20|It's true and we should point out some have paused all of their social media buying.
NEUT21|It's not just Facebook, but your point is well taken.
NEUT22|Jim and I think this certainly deserves a good deal of attention and focus from here, because is this a new era?
NEUT23|Where corporations as you say either trying to get ahead of their customers or are simply responding more forcibly to what they believe are the desires of their customers and what their behavior they those customers want to see the Corporation take.
NEUT24|It's very interesting, important, taken in the context overall as well of the changes we've talked about to some extent in terms of the responsibility of corporations, the Business Roundtable statement from early this year.
NEUT25|It is also worth watching closely, not to mention, of course the impact it's having on some of the some of the social media companies led.
NEUT26|Of course by Facebook.
NEUT27|Yeah, look, I think that we have to recognize that the trade people are talking about is OK. Where's the money going is going to snap?
NEUT28|Is it going to alphabet?
NEUT29|Which remember one time had its own issues is going to go back to Facebook after this thing dies down because or does it not matter 'cause there are 8,000,000 advertisers on Facebook?
NEUT30|But what I would point out is this is a new social ESG changed?
NEUT31|David, it really is, as you mentioned an what I think when you get when you get a Verizon or Starbucks saying you know what we're reviewing these things.
NEUT32|That's something that Mark Zuckerberg has to sit down with these people and say what do you want?
NEUT33|What do you want because will give it to you.
NEUT34|You can't just ignore these advertisers and act as if nothing's changed.
NEUT35|Things have changed big in this country is changed really fast, much faster than any of us.
NEUT36|Maybe not look my my 28 year old says it's not.
NEUT37|It's changing with you slowly me.
NEUT38|"It's like it's like lightning."""
