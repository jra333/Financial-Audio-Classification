BEAR0|"""Facebook shares have dived in the US after the social media Giants warned it expects weaker growth."
BEAR1|The stock plunged 20% when the US markets opened in New York, wiping $120 billion off its market value.
BEAR2|Facebook has had a challenging year with millions of users desserting it after the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal run.
NEUT3|Join Now by the social media trade expert to be bereford to be good to see you.
BULL4|Thanks for joining us this afternoon.
NEUT5|Has Facebook had its day?
NEUT6|Hi Kamal, no I don't think so.
NEUT7|I think this is really just a blip there are.
BEAR8|There are some pretty good reasons why their earnings of dip, so I don't think it's anything really for stockholders.
NEUT9|Particularly worried about a lot of people say with social media companies.
NEUT10|It's all about trust and given what happened with Cambridge Analytica, that trust has gone.
NEUT11|Yeah, I don't think so.
BULL12|I think that they've they've kind of responded pretty strongly to that that requirement, and they've, they've.
NEUT13|They've got involved in this trust so.
NEUT14|Talking to Congress and so on.
NEUT15|And they put in place some pretty serious changes to their platform.
NEUT16|They're restricting the ecosystem, sort of the the ability for the ecosystem of developers, small businesses to kind of access that data.
NEUT17|And Cambridge Analytica was one of those.
NEUT18|I mean, I think I mean what's caused this particular particular blip is that Facebook are making changes to the platform like any big social media platform.
NEUT19|They're making changes to adapt to the changing way in which we use it.
NEUT20|So, for example, there putting a lot more emphasis on stories, so.
NEUT21|Which is those ephemeral sort of Snapchat like sharing on the platform.
NEUT22|We've got 150,000,000 people using stories on Facebook and across all the Facebook properties, they've got a billion people using stories, so that's obviously a big new change.
NEUT23|New feature that they're trying to bring in, and I don't think the advertisers are particularly caught up with that yet.
NEUT24|They're they're still kind of still wanting to advertise with Facebook in the kind of the old way.
NEUT25|And and Facebook's already starting to move them on.
NEUT26|So I think these sorts of things, sort of earnings blips really come come when there are changes to the platform and and they are.
NEUT27|We have to remember, these are intentional changes.
NEUT28|This isn't something that's.
NEUT29|Happened to Facebook from outside their positively making this move when the Cambridge Analytica scandal first broke, I did and unscientific study tool, and so a few young people and you got the sense that many of them didn't really use Facebook anyway, they moved on to other social platforms like like Instagram.
NEUT30|I mean, to what extent would you say that is the case and to what extent does that really matter?
NEUT31|'cause a social media platform like Instagram, Facebook owns anyway?
NEUT32|Well, that's right, and actually was interesting.
NEUT33|This was the first time that Facebook actually brought the numbers of all its platforms together and said across the Big Three, the Facebook, the Snapchat and an Instagram.
NEUT34|We we have two and a half billion people who used our our apps in in June, which is an astonishing number.
NEUT35|So they they've already kind of hedged their bets against that sort of move to Instagram.
NEUT36|And there's there's no reason to surprise no reason to suppose they won't do so again.
NEUT37|So be good to talk to you.
NEUT38|"Just going to take you live to Brussels now with the Brexit secretary."""
