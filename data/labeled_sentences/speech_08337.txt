NEUT0|"""My name is Jordan Belford."
NEUT1|Did the tender age of 22.
NEUT2|I headed to the only place that they fit my high minded, ambitious move the money from your clients pocket and you got it.
NEUT3|But if you can make clients money at the same time, it's advantageous everyone correct now.
NEUT4|Welcome back to opinion Journal.
NEUT5|I'm Mary Kissel Martin Scorsese's latest film The Wolf of Wall Street glorifies a fraudster called Jordan Bellfort.
NEUT6|Is this another instance of Hollywood misleading the public?
NEUT7|I've got Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher partner, Joel Cohen, who actually prosecuted the real life Jordan Belfort.
NEUT8|Joining me now is this a guy we're celebrating in your experience?
NEUT9|Certainly not worth celebrating.
NEUT10|No, absolutely not.
NEUT11|Maybe he's worth watching a movie if you're interested in watching debauchery and.
NEUT12|In all kinds of fraud, if it were properly made with absolutely not worth celebrating.
NEUT13|But what's wrong with making a film that people want to see?
NEUT14|I mean, we're both capitalists.
NEUT15|There's absolutely nothing wrong with making a movie that people want to see and will remain to be seen.
NEUT16|How many people will actually go?
NEUT17|The problem that I have with it having been the prosecutor of these guys, including Jordan Belfort, is that they the movie makers, didn't really seem to understand what they were about.
NEUT18|What were they about?
NEUT19|They were about blatant outright securities, fraud of a kind that you don't usually see on Wall Street.
NEUT20|We called dumping pump OK?
NEUT21|Now, DiCaprio says that Scorsese doesn't judge the characters and isn't condoning this guys behavior.
NEUT22|What?
NEUT23|What would you say in response to that?
NEUT24|Well, I think that's true to a large degree.
BEAR25|You can see that the depiction is pretty negative.
NEUT26|However, they first of all, when you have anybody in the world depicted by DiCaprio, they're going to look cute.
NEUT27|They're looking at.
NEUT28|They're going to look good, right?
NEUT29|They're going to look at attractive, and that's no different here.
BEAR30|And what really rubbed me the wrong way at the end of the movie The very last scene, which I think belied the point that Scorsese is trying to make in his defense.
NEUT31|They had a very last scene and I'm not ruining the movie for anyone here by saying this where DiCaprio playing Belford appears on a screen with the real Jordan Belfort behind them is a banner, a placard advertising for the Real Jordan Belfort its current business where he sells motivational speaking opportunities and that to me stepped over the line because they're blurring reality and fiction in a way in which they essentially are endorsing Jordan Belford.
NEUT32|And what he does.
NEUT33|How many people did he hurt?
NEUT34|Thousands 10s of thousands?
NEUT35|They gotten their money back, no?
NEUT36|Almost almost entirely not.
NEUT37|And what was he like in person when you, when you started to investigate him and go after colorful charming?
NEUT38|If your wallet was safely guarded in your in your back pocket or somewhere else?
NEUT39|But fundamentally, I mean that what he described about his behavior and we spent many months debriefing them privately before they started cooperating, was that he would wake up every day and literally say to himself, what crimes can I commit today?
NEUT40|That's the kind of person indictment of Hollywood film never should have been made.
NEUT41|Film never should have been made.
NEUT42|OK Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher partner: The prosecutor of the Wolf of Wall Street.
BULL43|"Thanks so much for joining us."""
