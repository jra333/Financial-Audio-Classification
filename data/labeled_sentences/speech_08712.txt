NEUT0|"""Price patterns are important and helpful."
NEUT1|Part of technical analysis.
BEAR2|However, there's a few pitfalls that can stop you in your tracks if you're not careful.
NEUT3|Will look at three in patience and flexibility and tunnel vision.
NEUT4|Let's start with impatience.
NEUT5|Technicians are often eager to label a pattern as soon as it starts to form.
NEUT6|However, continuation patterns can fail and become reversal patterns.
NEUT7|Reversal patterns can fail and become continuation patterns.
NEUT8|The fact is, you won't know if the pattern is a continuation or reversal pattern until the price breaks, support or resistance.
NEUT9|That's where patience comes into play.
NEUT10|Let me explain.
NEUT11|After a stock has been uptrending for some time, it's human nature to try and call the top as soon as the stock creates a second equal high.
NEUT12|New traders often assume it's a double top pattern and enter the trade.
BULL13|However, say support doesn't break the stock rallies and 1/3 equal high forms.
NEUT14|These traders are out of luck, but undeterred, they may become convinced.
NEUT15|It's a triple top pattern.
NEUT16|Say the stock breaks higher and the pattern turns out to be a rectangle, which is a continuation pattern.
BEAR17|These traders are out of luck again.
NEUT18|Alternatively, when the first pattern started to emerge, they could have waited for the signals to confirm the pattern before entering.
BULL19|This could have led to a more successful trade.
NEUT20|Another common occurrence is seeing a triangle pattern and expecting it to be a continuation pattern.
NEUT21|While triangles are commonly categorized as continuation patterns until price breaks, support or resistance, nothing is for sure.
NEUT22|Be patient and wait for the signals.
BEAR23|The next pitfall is inflexibility.
NEUT24|Some traders have a plan for a certain pattern and if that pattern doesn't play out there stuck a flexible trader waits for the pattern and adjust her plan accordingly.
NEUT25|If, for example, you're waiting for resistance break but support breaks instead, qualified traders could consider making the short trade instead of the long trade.
NEUT26|Remember, one of the benefits of technical analysis is the flexibility to trade in any market condition, so learn to be flexible as you learn to be patient.
NEUT27|Don't let an unexpected move.
NEUT28|Throw off your game.
NEUT29|The final pitfall is tunnel vision.
NEUT30|Basically this means getting so caught up in identifying and labeling price patterns that you stop paying attention to price.
NEUT31|You don't need to be dogmatic about the names of the price patterns or if the price pattern performed exactly how you expect it.
NEUT32|Remember, price patterns are just another way to look at support and resistance, and one way to trade support and resistance is to consider trading whichever breakout occurs first.
NEUT33|"So as you incorporate price patterns in your investing plans, remember to watch out for these pitfalls and patience and flexibility and tunnel vision."""
