NEUT0|"""We're gonna get out of San Francisco right now, over to the CNBC Bureau at one market Plaza where Jim Kramer joins us."
NEUT1|Jim, I want to get your views on HD here.
NEUT2|Take a look at HD, really.
NEUT3|'cause some people take HD Supply, Home Depot Home Depot gym.
NEUT4|OK look, this is one of those where I I'm going to miss Carol to.
NEUT5|May the CFO, longtime CFO of Home Depot because I think she could put it in context.
NEUT6|Look, they did something that I think can be recovered once we find out more about why there was an internal glitch.
NEUT7|I thought that what Melissa said at the very beginning was most important when she said it's not the first time.
NEUT8|Now there's going to be a certain point where people say it's not the first time.
NEUT9|Let's pay less for this company, but you know what?
NEUT10|Every time it's been the first time.
NEUT11|In terms of some new excuse but over and over again and recurring problem people say, let it settle and buy and I think that's probably going to happen again because of exactly what you guys just set up Melissa about the seven month lag.
NEUT12|So wouldn't you want to buy it with the seven month?
NEUT13|Like after today's numbers that Rick talked about and I think so?
NEUT14|I think the answer is yes, but I did.
NEUT15|I'm going to Miss Cal tomates.
NEUT16|Excellent explanation of what the hell happened.
BULL17|Do you agree with analyst Jim that Lowe's is a better buy?
BULL18|Because evaluation of 17 times and it should theoretically close the gap with Home Depot 22?
NEUT19|Or should losby?
NEUT20|A discounted valuation through a Home Depot.
NEUT21|I think there's still a little bit discount evaluation, and you know who tells me that Marvin Ellison, the CEO he is saying, please don't get ahead of yourself, Jim, please don't push the stock basically saying please don't push the stock that much.
BULL22|I think yellow since unbelievable.
BULL23|I think he's doing a great job.
NEUT24|The company Lowe's had no technology to speak of Marvin's, putting a lot of tech in as he knew to do at Home Depot.
NEUT25|Sad to say it because my Chapel trust owns Home Depot for about 50 points.
BULL26|Lowe's is getting to be a better by.
BEAR27|I don't want to again get ahead of what Marvin's telling me.
BULL28|"Well, Mom's got a plan and I've got to tell you something else and has some bold moves to be far better than it's been for anytime in the last decade."""
