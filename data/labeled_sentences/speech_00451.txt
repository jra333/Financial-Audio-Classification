NEUT0|"""Can we talk?"
NEUT1|Let's talk Bitcoin.
NEUT2|2000, 2012 I was introduced to it.
BULL3|I started to accumulate accumulate 2013.
NEUT4|I wrote an article and you hold on just so we just so we know we can feel bad about ourselves.
NEUT5|You're accumulating it at what price?
NEUT6|Well, my dollar cost average is around 100 and something and you've held it.
NEUT7|Everything you've bought.
NEUT8|Well at one point myself and I was introduced to it by a person I asked him if I could disclose his name.
NEUT9|He said no, but he myself and another person all three of us relatively well known in the Valley we went.
NEUT10|We started at one point.
NEUT11|We owned almost 5% of the entire float in 2013.
NEUT12|We've sold, they've sold etc etc.
NEUT13|I wish we had kept it all.
NEUT14|We didn't, it's fine, but then I wrote an article and I said, you know what?
BEAR15|There's so much asymmetric upside here.
NEUT16|This is a thing that either goes to, you know at the time I said roughly the value of gold.
NEUT17|And at the time it was about $100 a coin, and so there's very little downside.
NEUT18|There's all this asymmetric upside.
NEUT19|I said.
NEUT20|Take 1% of your net worth and by this schmuck insurance.
NEUT21|And it's a schmuck insurance in this kind of very elegant, beautiful way that I missed the schmuck insurance that was at $100 though.
NEUT22|What would I mean?
NEUT23|I actually started hearing from people that I know very well who don't often invest who are now asking me if this is the time to buy this much insurance.
NEUT24|Now here's here's the thing.
NEUT25|This is now a confidence game, right?
NEUT26|There is no real utility in this.
BULL27|This is a fantastic.
NEUT28|Fundamental hedge and store value against autocratic regimes and banking infrastructure that we know is corrosive to how the world needs to work properly.
NEUT29|You cannot have central banks infinitely printing currency.
NEUT30|You cannot have folks with misguided and misdirected monetary and fiscal policy.
NEUT31|OK, you just called it a confidence game.
BULL32|Which is right, and we've done OK.
NEUT33|Economies built on central banks and built on Fiat currencies where you said yourself how much better life is and.
NEUT34|Every respect and it's ever been, and that's with that as a infrastructure.
NEUT35|So we've seen the first few chapters of this and now we have to go through this great unwind, right when all this liquidity Now what happens?
NEUT36|What happens?
NEUT37|We'll see what happens and so all I'm saying is to have the ability to hedge that out in a way that isn't fundamentally correlated to the people in the infrastructure that made those decisions that we were not a part of.
NEUT38|Fundamentally, I think is a smart point is if you haven't jumped on this bus or train or whatever vehicle you want to describe it as.
NEUT39|As it left the station, no.
NEUT40|So here's what I would say the same way that I said in 2013 put 1% of your net worth into Bitcoin.
NEUT41|I will put myself out there today.
NEUT42|I think this thing is $100,000.
NEUT43|A coin probably in the next three to four years and I think it is in the next 20 years, $1,000,000 ago.
NEUT44|So there you have it.
NEUT45|You're telling people to put one of 1% of your network that that's that's firm.
NEUT46|It's a lot harder, but that's for people who have money to play with.
NEUT47|I mean, if you're talking to an average retail investor who's looking at this, somebody who's trying to figure out, should I put it in my 401K or should I put it in Bitcoin?
NEUT48|You would tell them what.
NEUT49|Well, I don't think that's the actual trade off in your 401K.
NEUT50|So for example, in your IR A I'm saying that there are people who have to make decisions about these things weren't fully invested in the 4:01.
NEUT51|So what I'm saying is I own a lot of Bitcoin.
NEUT52|In my IRA.
NEUT53|It is possible.
NEUT54|So I did take a small percentage and I put it in there.
NEUT55|All I'm saying is there's a Scottish lesson.
NEUT56|Everyone most tax advantage way absolutely, but you have money to play with.
NEUT57|What I'm saying is you could buy the S&P 500 index.
NEUT58|By 99% of that.
NEUT59|So if you have $100 to invest, what I'm saying is $1.00 one dollar and the reason that $1.00 is still valuable is that it is fundamentally not correlated to the other 99.
BULL60|"And just on the off chance that all the people that manage the 99 may not totally know what they're doing, the $1.00 may actually save us all."""
