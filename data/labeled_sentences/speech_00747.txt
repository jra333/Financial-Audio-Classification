BULL0|"""Alright, moving on to Tesla, those years were 13% this morning at long last."
NEUT1|Perhaps for Tesla Bulls, the company is going to be going into the S&P 500.
NEUT2|That will happen before the open of trading on December 21st.
NEUT3|If you look at how big Tesla is right now, it would be if it entered today this morning, the 10th largest stock in the S&P 500 by market cap just after Johnson and Johnson, which is pretty incredible here.
NEUT4|And guys.
BEAR5|Obviously there's been a lot of controversy around Tesla.
BULL6|Is it consistently profitable enough?
NEUT7|Especially if you look at the numbers on a gap basis?
NEUT8|You know, is this the company that deserves to be in the S&P 500?
NEUT9|Well, the committee answered the question.
NEUT10|They're putting it in there, but I I wonder what the trajectory is going to be like.
NEUT11|Miles, you want to?
NEUT12|You want to weigh in on this look, I I actually I would just kind of take a line that that Charlie O'Shea told us to talk about the retailers doesn't relate to Tesla, but he said that, you know, the Walmart story is so great right now that it's becoming boring an.
NEUT13|You look at the last couple of quarters.
NEUT14|For Tesla the numbers are kind of just regularly good, right?
BEAR15|They're selling a few more cars than they expected.
NEUT16|The cars are mostly being delivered on time.
BULL17|The company is turning a nice modest profit.
NEUT18|I understand there's a lot of passion, a lot of excitement around the stock.
NEUT19|My favorite kind of bear comment from last night was this was the final catalyst for Tesla, and I don't know if that was made in earnestness, or if that was made in jest, but I do think that the look Elon Musk has said it himself.
BEAR20|In 2018, when you look at the stock you said boy, there's something wrong here.
NEUT21|He said they were close to going, running out of cash, right?
NEUT22|They were there.
BEAR23|Their financial position was quite weak.
NEUT24|Well, now the story is completely different.
NEUT25|And I mean, I know Elon is very exciting and we talk about him all the time because he does very ill and E things.
NEUT26|But the Tesla operational story itself is somewhat straightforward and Susie.
NEUT27|I think they have a lot of those secular tailwinds that they think they're riding.
NEUT28|Electrification, ESG, and so on.
NEUT29|I think that's kind of just in place.
NEUT30|Well, for now miles, there's no question this company.
BEAR31|They really turned the corner, but at some point those EV tax credits that have boosted at Tesla's bottom line here will wear off.
NEUT32|I would also add this.
NEUT33|Does S&P 500 inclusion mean that Elon Musk finally tones it down a little bit?
NEUT34|It does this mean he's not out there tweeting about potential COVID-19 misinformation?
NEUT35|It's unclear there's a lot more.
NEUT36|Come on now.
NEUT37|President a lot more responsibility here for Elon Musk.
NEUT38|When you're SMP 500 company, I would argue the screening only goes up and now the onus on him is to act like more like a more regular CEO.
NEUT39|He may hate it, but that's the reality you want to play with the Big Dogs.
NEUT40|You have to be a big dog.
NEUT41|I don't.
NEUT42|I don't.
NEUT43|We're going to continue to debate this.
NEUT44|"I don't see it happening."""
