NEUT0|"""We've got a big trade update for you."
NEUT1|On Friday, we spoke with Barstool Sports founder turned daytrader Dave Portnoy.
BEAR2|He told us he was down $1.1 million thanks in part to some bad bets on Boeing.
NEUT3|But check out what happened today.
NEUT4|One more big uptick.
NEUT5|I don't even know what's doing it.
NEUT6|Give it, give it back.
BULL7|After today's rally, Davey Day Traders portfolio is now up more than $1,000,000.
NEUT8|Dave Portnoy joins us now Dave, you certainly had a lot of roller coasters trading and we have you on because you are the everyman.
NEUT9|So many people are at home and they are day trading their accounts now so they see a little bit of themselves in you now that you're up a million.
NEUT10|What are you doing?
NEUT11|Well, I let it all right.
BULL12|So today was a good day.
NEUT13|I'm wearing the green I'm gonna start by saying it's a lot more fun to make money then lose money.
BULL14|So today was the most fun I've had on the stock market so I still had all the airlines in the in their way up.
NEUT15|The cruises do away up Alibaba which I'm going to hold through earnings in all the Chinese like Internet companies are smashing earnings.
BULL16|There's more today so I think we're gonna have a big week.
NEUT17|But I think the airlines will come back and I love this game.
NEUT18|You know when I'm whenever I'm on this show, all the critics like why you have this guy on.
NEUT19|He doesn't know he's talking about he's a moron.
NEUT20|Well, I made a million today so now I'm the smartest guy in the room so I'm having fun.
NEUT21|Here's the question though.
NEUT22|You don't make money until you actually take profit.
NEUT23|So is that?
NEUT24|Have you done that, Dave?
NEUT25|Have you actually sold anything that you made money on today?
NEUT26|No, well you're correct, but I, that's why it wasn't down money either.
BULL27|So pretty much back.
BEAR28|Even I I'm still down 100 grand.
BULL29|I was up a million.
BEAR30|I was down 1.1 but yeah yes it's all on the Internet right now.
NEUT31|No, I haven't closed out.
NEUT32|I haven't done anything.
NEUT33|I'm still trading.
NEUT34|I want to get you some advice Dave to Tim Seymour's an expert.
NEUT35|On Chinese Internet stocks.
NEUT36|Tim, I think Dave is probably referring to the Biden results that we got today.
BULL37|The stock is up in the after hours session.
NEUT38|What do you think of Alibaba?
NEUT39|Well, I I like Alibaba, I mean I guess that the metaphor Dave, though is when you've got an aging veteran hitting 220.
NEUT40|But he hits for the cycle.
NEUT41|Do you want to keep him in your roto team?
NEUT42|And I, I think I do.
NEUT43|If I look at the Chinese Internet names.
NEUT44|It's not.
NEUT45|You know, it was certainly an early pioneer, but it's not the name that I want to stay with long term.
NEUT46|I think the snapbacks very important.
NEUT47|Rather be in 10 cent and ultimately rather being Alibaba.
NEUT48|That's what I meant.
NEUT49|I'm in Alibaba.
NEUT50|Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you said bye do excuse me so that that must have been confusing.
BULL51|Baidu is certainly relative value to Alibaba.
NEUT52|Love Alibaba.
BEAR53|Yes, stay home sorry.
BEAR54|Alright good that almost got real confusing.
NEUT55|I would accompany ahead if I got rid of that.
NEUT56|"Now that would have been good TV."""
