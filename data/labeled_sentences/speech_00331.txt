NEUT0|"""We know that Roblox is a kids gaming app, but did something very grown up today."
NEUT1|It went public on the New York Stock Exchange and with a splash it it to direct listing the stock opening at $64.50 a share.
NEUT2|Actually now at 69.
BULL3|As you can see here, as the numbers are moving as we speak, the stock up 50 nearly 53% giving this company a market cap of well over $35 billion, not child's play.
NEUT4|Jerrod Blicker is here now.
NEUT5|To break it down for us, Jeremy knew it was going to be big, but wow.
NEUT6|Yeah, big and also late I 1:30 PM for an IPO.
NEUT7|Will not an IPO direct listing to trade for the first time, but that might be a record.
NEUT8|I remember the first one I saw it down at the New York Stock Exchange with Spotify that took till about 12:30, but this is GTS as a direct market maker.
BULL9|This is GTS is first direct listing and so they got it done and we can see that it's up over 55% here from that reference price and I'll just show us a candle stick chart of the opening price action here and it did trade as high as $70.00 per share.
NEUT10|And that equates to over $40 billion valuation on a fully diluted basis.
NEUT11|You take away that, and it's probably somewhere in the range of 35 billion that you were just quoting Alexis.
NEUT12|But this is only the fifth major direct listing to come to the market and next month we're probably going to get coin based.
NEUT13|That's going to be the first one to list on the NASDAQ, but lots of excitement around this particular issue.
NEUT14|Roblox or Roblox.
BEAR15|Excuse me, may be showing him out of step with the gaming community right there.
BULL16|But nevertheless, a nice showing for this stock on its first day of trading.
BULL17|"Nice indeed alright, thanks a lot, Jerrod."""
