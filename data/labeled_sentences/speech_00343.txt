BULL0|"""Whatever you thought, as you've watched the stock, go up 80% from $400 in change to this morning looking at $836.00 in the premarket."
NEUT1|We gotta remember that 2014 when we were buying our stock about a million six shares an average price of $219.
NEUT2|And as you know, since they've been on this show several times since the stock went between 350 and 180 and 250, so it's all over that period of time was when this company wasn't profitable, was expanding rapidly.
BEAR3|They were being criticized by short sellers.
BEAR4|It was very difficult for them to get started because dealers would try to prevent them from selling cars in individual states.
NEUT5|Now things have all come together and, but in the period of time since 2014 the stock price didn't change very much through last summer.
NEUT6|So through last summer our $219 stock was two 3240, so we made 10% twenty percent, 30% at the same period of time.
NEUT7|The company's business we focus on business, not stock prices.
BULL8|The company's business had grown from $2.8 billion of annual revenues for 25 billion of annual revenues, 8 fold.
BULL9|So companies up eightfold stocks up 20 percent, 10%.
NEUT10|Now it's happening this just catch up now.
NEUT11|This year Tesla is going to somewhere around $32 billion in revenues and I guess that they're going to do a $100 billion in revenues within four years.
BULL12|And I think the potential for a trillion dollars in revenues within 10 years.
NEUT13|So basically you're looking at the very start of what testing what's going to happen.
NEUT14|We test that this could be one of the largest companies in the whole world.
BULL15|Trillion dollars in revenue in 10 years.
NEUT16|That's assuming you do 10 million cars.
NEUT17|There's ninety million cars, or 95 million cars sold.
NEUT18|Yes, and that's without the battery business.
NEUT19|Something that is 7 and we're thinking 750 billion to a trillion dollars in revenues just on the car.
NEUT20|Business Airline says that the battery business is going to be as big as the car business.
NEUT21|In addition to that, when I'm thinking about 10 million cars a year, the last conversation he had, he said it was twenty million quarters is what he thinks he can do.
NEUT22|And So what we're talking about is a business that right now demand is overwhelming for the product that they're selling.
NEUT23|And they're constrained.
NEUT24|As far as making as many cars as they could sell because they don't have enough batteries.
BULL25|So now this is a nice move.
NEUT26|Announcement today about Panasonic making money in the plant they have in in Reno, but they need to have more batteries.
NEUT27|They're going to have a battery day in in a few months, but they have all the analysts coming out and they're going to show how they're addressing the issue of where these batteries going to come from.
NEUT28|"To make all these cars that are possible to make."""
