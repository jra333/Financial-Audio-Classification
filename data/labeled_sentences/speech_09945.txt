NEUT0|"""It's time now for charting futures."
NEUT1|Here's Abigail, Doolittle and Abigail.
NEUT2|I hear you're taking a look at Bitcoin hold Rally mode today.
NEUT3|You're right about that.
BULL4|Romain, at this point, Bitcoin is up about 20%.
NEUT5|If you can believe it, and over the last 13 trading days only one down day, look at that.
NEUT6|It's really pretty incredible.
BULL7|71% the Bulls clearly in charge storming into Bitcoin, Facebook's new cryptocurrency Libra, giving the space a little bit of validation and everybody having that FOMO, or at least some traders, investors having FOMO driving Bitcoin higher.
NEUT8|Out of a bear market, in fact, Bitcoin over the last decade or so has really seen a few cycles.
NEUT9|Let's take a look at this longer term chart in the Bloomberg.
BEAR10|This is Bitcoin spot.
NEUT11|Actually this is not Bitcoin spot, but this is the Bitcoin Futures chart that we were going to take a look at with Mike Mcglone and Mike.
NEUT12|I'd like to bring you in here and I'm just going to kind of cross over to meet you and you're making the point here that this is a bottom of sorts for Bitcoin.
BULL13|I am what you see here is a breakthrough through significant resistance.
NEUT14|The market went through that level like a hot knife through butter.
NEUT15|It's very rare when I see that I think.
NEUT16|This is a signal.
NEUT17|What this is?
NEUT18|This is the price you know the bear market and the major distribution here.
NEUT19|It started with futures launch distribution.
NEUT20|Here all built around 65101.
NEUT21|Bitcoin broke through that.
BULL22|It basically says to me it's going to make new highs and so it should go above 20,000.
NEUT23|But the key thing is where is your definition of risk?
NEUT24|And it could also get all the way back on 6500.
NEUT25|That's why I see Bitcoins different has a high volatility.
NEUT26|So I look at it is it's an indication is going higher, definition risk is down here.
BEAR27|You're supposed to be buying into the dip and expect to go up, but you don't want it to sustain back below that 6500 level, OK?
NEUT28|We were going to take a look at would show the cycles that this has happened before, which is not true for all marketplaces.
BULL29|But in the case of Bitcoin, it has shown that once you come out of that area of distribution for Bitcoin that it really does mean that we're going to see a new high.
BULL30|Do you think we could see some consolidation though?
NEUT31|'cause I was making the point that the laws of physics take a look at that one candle there.
NEUT32|This is what a weekly chart.
NEUT33|So this weekly candle, the laws of physics parabolic uptrend 90 degrees cannot hold.
NEUT34|You could make the case that the whole thing could reverse.
NEUT35|So what if that were to happen?
NEUT36|If it were to go back below 10,000?
NEUT37|Dollars per Bitcoin?
NEUT38|How do you advise the key risk I think is getting back below 6500.
NEUT39|OK so that's a problem, but it's Bitcoin volatility and they supposed to expect that they think they remember here is.
NEUT40|This was supposed to be resistance the last time on your other shirt, which we can maybe show another time it held resistance for about six months.
NEUT41|I expected that, but when it goes through like this, you have to readjust and say, oh it's telling me something and it is.
NEUT42|And then we had this little consolidation above.
NEUT43|Its Tony somethings going higher and I just look for the first target.
NEUT44|Last year's highs which happened to be right when futures were launched.
NEUT45|And you made a great point for investors and traders around Bitcoin that it's not like gold, and the fact that you only want to invest what you can afford to lose is that what you're saying.
NEUT46|I think this would volatility exactly and expect that.
NEUT47|And I know, I know that's a far way to look to dip, but it could happen.
NEUT48|Look, that's gap that's parabolic.
NEUT49|We know that's kind of a frenzy, but we know that Bitcoin does.
BULL50|It goes up a lot easier, and that goes down great points.
NEUT51|Well, let's not take a look at the futures here.
NEUT52|If we go into the Bloomberg and we look at the contract table and here we are.
NEUT53|Taking a look at it and there we go.
NEUT54|The description page here on the Bitcoin futures.
NEUT55|Yes, I think the key thing to think about when you look at Bitcoin futures for everyone future you control 5 bitcoins and then there's margin.
NEUT56|That's ideal thing about margins.
NEUT57|So Eric if you can show down here, one speculator cost $23,000.
NEUT58|So basically you with per margin you could cost you two Bitcoin to control 5.
BEAR59|So that's you know that's a volatile position.
NEUT60|But that's when it benefits.
NEUT61|The future is to get that margin.
NEUT62|One thing I think that's really happening is futures.
BEAR63|Open interest is increasing rapidly, which means institutions are getting into space, and they're not buying the altcoins.
NEUT64|They're going for Bitcoin, and they like the futures because of the regulation and the transparency correct, so you don't have to worry about all that you know is going to steal your coins.
NEUT65|It's easier codes that can be lost exactly.
NEUT66|"Futures and regulated and transparent."""
