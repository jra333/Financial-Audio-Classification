BULL0|"""Donald Trump's election as U.S. President has kicked off an absolutely extraordinary moment in global bond markets."
NEUT1|Here to talk about it is Lawrence Nutkin, who is the head of G10 global rate strategy for BNP Paribar Lawrence.
BULL2|Thank you so much for joining us so we have our first chart.
NEUT3|Can you explain what it is that we're looking at here?
BEAR4|Yep, well we're looking at the 10 year Treasury yield an we're looking at this pretty dramatic 40 basis points sell off that we've had since the election result.
NEUT5|And why did that happen in the US?
NEUT6|Well, for one thing, I think the market was surprised by the outcome.
NEUT7|And for a second thing, it seems that Donald Trump's fiscal policy is very expansionary.
BEAR8|Which means more government borrowing and higher nominal GDP growth, both of which would be bad for government bond yields.
BEAR9|So we're expecting more inflation and more growth, and that means that people don't want to hang on to their bonds anymore.
NEUT10|Yeah, so you can.
NEUT11|You can divide the bond yield into two parts.
NEUT12|You can think of it as being the inflation compensation or break even inflation and the real yield.
BEAR13|Now what's happened since the election outcome is that break.
BULL14|Even inflation has jumped significantly as people expect inflation to be much closer now to the target that the Fed has than they did before.
BEAR15|Real yields likewise have risen, but not.
NEUT16|Quite as much, and the combination of these things together has so far been worth about 40 basis points on on the nominal 10 year yield.
NEUT17|OK, so this is this is a US event.
NEUT18|What's been happening in the rest of the world as it had a feed through to global bond markets, but it has had a feedthrough.
NEUT19|We've, you might say what.
NEUT20|OK?
BULL21|So I can understand that now we're going to have more fiscal stimulus in the US.
BULL22|We're going to get higher nominal GDP in the US.
NEUT23|We're going to see higher yields in the US, but obviously that's not.
NEUT24|None of that is affecting your directly, but if I change this to.
NEUT25|The Bund yield.
BULL26|You can see that likewise the Bund yield has climbed as well, albeit to a lesser extent.
BULL27|So bonds around the world are rising.
BEAR28|This is good news for you and bad news for who.
BULL29|Well the yields are rising.
BULL30|If you have rising for the right reason, it's good news for the whole world economy.
BEAR31|If they're rising because this this great spectre of deflation which been worried about for so long.
NEUT32|If that if that is now looking less likely, I guess we would say for the economy as a whole this is going to be.
BEAR33|Good news, I mean in the in, the more prosaic near term I guess people who owned bonds two weeks ago have looking at a capital loss because they're worth less today.
NEUT34|And let's look at the Eurozone in particular.
BEAR35|So for Italy, I think this hasn't been particularly good week for them.
BULL36|So the spread between the yields in Italy and Germany have gone up quite sharply and then they have.
NEUT37|This is your.
BULL38|This is your chart of the spread between Italy and Germany, and as you can see we've had a rise here too.
NEUT39|So so what's that about?
NEUT40|I think it's about two things.
NEUT41|We do have political risk in Italy, which we've known as coming in in terms of the upcoming referendum, and I think what we've seen in a variety of votes is taught the markets to be skeptical of the polls, and in particular to fear the more populist, less establishment outcome.
BEAR42|And for Italy, that would mean a no vote in the upcoming referendum to Renzi's reforms.
NEUT43|And as you can see the markets now expecting that this increased political risk.
NEUT44|Deserves more pricing into a greater extent.
NEUT45|Lawrence Mark and thank you very much.
BULL46|"Thank you."""
