BULL0|"""Elephants are going to challenge thanks for watching this video."
NEUT1|Friends in this video we are going to discuss about sunlink health systems and if you are observing the long term chart as you can see, we have the chart available since 1980.
NEUT2|So we have 40 years or worth of data now.
NEUT3|It is quite evident that whenever the stock.
NEUT4|That's just the lower end of the range.
NEUT5|It has a tendency to move and hit the higher end of the range now.
NEUT6|It it has done the same in the past.
NEUT7|And the way it is moving, it will probably do the same in the future as well, and that's what we're going to discuss.
NEUT8|So let's start here.
NEUT9|Now, on the downside.
NEUT10|The levels that you're going to look at.
NEUT11|So.
NEUT12|Here we have.
NEUT13|K. So.
NEUT14|This is what you have as a downside limit.
BULL15|OK, so all these support levels are intact and the stock has recently moved very.
NEUT16|I would say spontaneously and in a very fast manner so you have.
NEUT17|Your support level, which are something like this one point 28.91 point 64.51.
BULL18|And I think it has already crossed the halfway mark.
NEUT19|So this is also a resistance level.
BEAR20|With the stock has recently crossed.
NEUT21|OK.
NEUT22|So yeah, we have 3.03.
NEUT23|So I mean, these all are support levels and you need to understand where you are feeling comfortable and.
NEUT24|You cannot wait for the stock to again go back to 51 cents and again and or jump back to four point $8.00.
NEUT25|So you need to choose your support level of ease of his stop loss respectively so that it can save your profit, but at the same time it will also give you the opportunity if you think it's going to, you know, bounce back.
BULL26|It will also give you the opportunity.
NEUT27|To add.
NEUT28|More position adjust.
NEUT29|Just for the sake of information that you're not losing out, OK, so.
NEUT30|Because it has already crossed halfway mark.
NEUT31|As I told you.
NEUT32|So the next target that we're looking at, if it continues to hold over $3, will be 6.18, which it has recently tested.
NEUT33|And then we have 8.68.
NEUT34|We have $11.00 and the probability is less, but.
NEUT35|After $11.00 you have one more level to go, which is as I asked $14.00 on the upside.
NEUT36|So these are the levels that we're looking at in the upcoming weeks as well as in the upcoming months.
BEAR37|And as the nature of the stock, the stock may go haywire from upside, downside and downside to upside.
NEUT38|So you need to adjust the volatility as well.
NEUT39|So make sure that you are not missing out on that.
NEUT40|So this is the end of the video.
