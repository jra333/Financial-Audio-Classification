NEUT0|"""Stocks, maybe the age old investment pick, but the best forecasters are saying sticking a stocking or a portfolio with commodities is a better bet for 2010 Sarah."
NEUT1|You've been taking a look at this angle.
NEUT2|What have you found?
NEUT3|Stocks, tank, commodities rule?
NEUT4|That's one trader tells me he's learned over the past several years and the best forecasters are saying 2010 commodities will continue to dominate now commodities, including oil, corn, gold, even gold and Palladium.
BULL5|Will rise as much as 17% this year if you ask the best strategists of 2009.
BEAR6|That clobbers an 11% gain expected for the SNP.
BULL7|It also beats forecasts for 10 year Treasurys.
BULL8|Here's here's why the outlook is brighter overall for commodities than for stocks.
NEUT9|It's all about the global recovery story, including China.
BULL10|Improving economic fundamentals around the world means more appetite for raw materials and for food.
NEUT11|We saw it play out this year.
BULL12|In fact, commodities had their best year.
BULL13|Since 1970, on the improvement in the overall global economy and fund managers tell us 2010.
BULL14|It's a great way to get exposure to emerging markets and to the China growth story.
NEUT15|Investing in commodities.
NEUT16|What about the US dollar?
BULL17|Because we're looking at commodity prices, gold, copper oil there higher this morning because of the weaker dollar people are saying the dollar is going to continue to strengthen in 2010.
NEUT18|Isn't that an obstacle?
NEUT19|That's right at that inverse.
NEUT20|Correlation is still very much alive.
BEAR21|A strengthening dollar could be a risk for this bullish commodity view, still.
BEAR22|More and more strategists are saying including Morgan Stanley are saying that that negative correlation is set to fade between commodities and the dollar, meaning is stronger dollar doesn't necessarily mean that commodities prices will fall, so that's one to keep an eye out.
NEUT23|"Bottom line, you're hearing bullish calls for the dollar for stocks for Treasurys, but the most bullish of all Scarlet is for commodities."""
