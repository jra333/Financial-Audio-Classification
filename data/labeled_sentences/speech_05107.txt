NEUT10|OK, so now I just want to do a very quick video on Netflix.
NEUT11|It's been awhile since we did a video for this.
BEAR12|Particular stock in over the last couple of months is giving me some pause here because over the last three months the market in Netflix has not been able to break above $380.
NEUT13|It tried here during October September of 2018.
BEAR14|As you can still tell that area is hindering Netflix from really moving to the upside.
BEAR15|Looking at the weekly chart, even over the last couple of weeks, the market in Netflix is gaining inundated with some silver orders is not a positive thing to see.
BEAR16|Currently, the market is still anticipated to see some movement to the downside, I don't see any strength coming in over the last couple of weeks.
NEUT17|The market participants are not trying to push this stock higher at the moment where Arsene anticipation for this stock to move to the downside and might try to hold this support line that we got drawn on our chart or even.
NEUT18|Around 330 to $340 is where the market and necklace may try to hold support, but.
NEUT19|Currently I'm not seeing any strength really coming into the market today.
BEAR20|Matter fact you see here that the market is definitely getting hit with some weakness to expect this current.
NEUT21|This stock to contain a move lower.
NEUT22|I'm looking between around 3:40 to $330 to be at the initial area support and one next and once Netflix get to those particular price points we will have to reevaluate to see whether or not we getting more weakness or strength into this particular stock.
BEAR23|Because right now if we still see more weakness.
BEAR24|Then definitely Netflix will break below 340 and $330 to where we can see a massive movement back down to lower prices, maybe even 310, three twenty OK.
NEUT25|So right now Netflix is not a buy.
BEAR26|The market is still anticipated to move to the downside.
BEAR27|We are seeing some indications of lack of interest and the momentum being swayed from one that was moving higher.
BULL28|To one that is going to be getting its movement lower in price so.
