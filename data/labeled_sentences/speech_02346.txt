NEUT0|"""Who?"
NEUT1|What is up you guys?
NEUT2|Peter color here or traders helping traders helping you grow your portfolio one trade at a time and today I want to talk about Disney.
BULL3|Great play I took on Disney.
NEUT4|Didn't go in with a lot and I sold too early, which is something I always do, but I want to talk about this play in why I saw value in it so we've seen over the past couple of days that a lot of these rebound companies.
BULL5|A lot of these companies that have been hit heavy due to the Roni Rona are finally starting to come back.
NEUT6|We've seen a lot of airline companies theme park companies, movie theaters, travel companies like all these companies who are getting slaughtered are coming back now on good vaccine news.
BULL7|Now Disney has been one of them and we saw a big push up yesterday.
BULL8|Volume very good push up and I saw that.
NEUT9|Let's go over here and let's go to historical.
BULL10|I saw here that we were getting a lot of calls coming in yesterday.
BULL11|Big consistent purchasing happening on Black box.
BULL12|Huge push coming in throughout the day.
NEUT13|I decided screw it.
NEUT14|I'm going to go ahead with some call debit spreads.
NEUT15|If you guys want to see the exact and specific play that I took, go down and follow me on Instagram so I post all my place.
NEUT16|I made 188 bucks.
NEUT17|40% returns.
NEUT18|I went in with such a small play guys it kills me but it's whatever 200 bucks for overnight is not bad on a single play but we had consistent buying consistent buying consistent buying and I solve if we go to the four hour resume out.
BEAR19|I bought around 1:45 and I saw we had a big resistance around 1:00.
NEUT20|We don't, you know, we push right up.
NEUT21|We hit 150.
BEAR22|I sell at 1:50 today and now we're continuing to break out and we're continuing to see major buying happening on the black box and then we have a major resistance here at 153.
NEUT23|I'll be honest.
NEUT24|I think we're going to break out.
NEUT25|I think we might hit 160 by the middle of December.
BULL26|I'm happy I sold.
BULL27|I didn't want to hold this too long, but overall, like we're looking really, really good here.
BULL28|Good volume moving into the stock.
NEUT29|I you know I'd be setting stop losses if you guys got in a couple of days ago for you know, pretty big amount of money.
NEUT30|Not a problem with taking profits here, but I do think we still still see this.
NEUT31|Probably push up to like one 53155 and then potentially 160.
BULL32|So very good play on Disney.
NEUT33|Congratulations if you're somebody who got in, congratulations.
NEUT34|If you're somebody who bought long term down at like 80 bucks, you're making a killing right now.
