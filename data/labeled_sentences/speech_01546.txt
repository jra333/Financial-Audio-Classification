NEUT9|I can't wait to tell you about it because there's some huge news that happened today.
NEUT10|With that being said, let's dive on into what is going on.
NEUT11|So the stock that I'm super excited about is called pay safe.
NEUT12|It was formerly called BFT, but today the board approved the merger with BFT and pay Safe and now the company is going to be pacing.
NEUT13|All disclosure already do on shares of pay safe and I'm going to be buying more shares.
NEUT14|This was the final step in the process of BFT becoming pay safe and now it is finalized.
NEUT15|Also it is worth noting that there is a ton of call options on this stock in play.
NEUT16|I'm going to show you that as well so stick around so we could take a look at that.
NEUT17|So what happens a lot with these stocks.
BULL18|After the merger, especially if they're a good company, they will do very well and have a nice room.
NEUT19|For example, can take a look at draft Kings droppings had an incredible run once it became draftings.
NEUT20|Now Speaking of draft Kings Draft Kings is one of the largest clients of pacing going forward.
NEUT21|Pay safe is going to benefit from the growth of draft Kings right now is March Madness and everything that is going on with March Madness is going to help out.
NEUT22|Pay safe as well.
NEUT23|Pay safe.
NEUT24|Does the transactions for drafting but not only do they do the payments for draft Kings, they also do the payments for Twitch.
BULL25|All sorts of different companies, so their main customers include Draft Kings, which went public is doing very well.
NEUT26|Roblox, which just went public.
NEUT27|If you're not aware of what Roblox is, a link of video above.
NEUT28|Also, they do Twitch and they do PokerStars.
BULL29|So this company is really poised to grow as gambling continues to be legalized across the world and across the country.
BULL30|So I think that BFT, which is now pay safe, is going to do very well in the future.
NEUT31|Also Paysafe has a lot of customers in the gaming industry, so whenever you're buying those.
NEUT32|Add on packs in your games.
NEUT33|Those are being processed by pacing.
NEUT34|If you own shares that pay safer, you're considering buying shares that pay safely with comment below.
NEUT35|I'm really interested in to see what you think about the company.
BULL36|Honestly, Paysafe has tremendous upside.
NEUT37|If you believe in DraftKings.
NEUT38|If you believe in Roblox, if you believe in Twitch, if you believe in PokerStars, if you believe in in gaming in all these different areas then pay safe is a great stock to own.
NEUT39|Also.
NEUT40|It is worth noting that anything that is said in this video is entertainment purposes only and I'm not.
NEUT41|A licensed financial advisor.
NEUT42|So earlier in the video I mentioned how there was a ton of call options being bought on paysafe it call option is essentially where you are betting on the stock to go up and you take a look at the call options.
NEUT43|Here you can see that there is almost five times more calls than there are puts on paysafe for the April 16th call option.
NEUT44|So that means that a lot of people really think that this stock now that it has merged is going to go up a lot more value.
NEUT45|Lastly, if there's a stock that you would like me to value.
