BEAR0|"""Michael Gabby, if you check the value of your 401K lately and may have seen a big decline in the value, but a couple of financial experts I talked to today say the thing to do right now is nothing."
BEAR1|Whether you own stocks or have a retirement account, this has been a rollercoaster week.
NEUT2|This is one for the record books.
BEAR3|The Dow down 11175 points.
BEAR4|It was the largest decline in a single day of trading that no one.
NEUT5|Nobody has a crystal ball 'cause nobody can figure out what's going to happen next, including Mike Miller saw coming.
NEUT6|The problem with this one, it doesn't work, but the financial planner in radio talk show host says the stock market decline can be explained.
NEUT7|One of those necessary things that you have to have every now and then.
BEAR8|If you don't have them every now and then, then stocks wouldn't earn more money overtime, he says what's happening now is a market correction driven by fears of inflation and rising wages.
NEUT9|He says investors should sit tight and let the stock prices work themselves out.
NEUT10|A feeling shared by Clemson University economics Professor Scott Bear probably do nothing, and so you just kind of keep an eye on the market over the next couple of weeks and see how things are evolving.
NEUT11|But in general, people who are in 401K's are in for the long haul and shouldn't react to day-to-day fluctuations in.
NEUT12|In the market.
BULL13|So despite the scary headlines, your investments are safe for now.
BULL14|Evidenced by the uptick in stock prices today.
BULL15|"Both men I spoke to today said the economy is good, wages are strong, and all this zigzagging that we're seeing in stock prices is just a normal market correction back to you."""
