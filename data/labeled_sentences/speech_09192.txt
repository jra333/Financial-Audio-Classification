BULL0|"""Bitcoin crossing above 20,000 today, continuing its recent rally and setting a new record high, we want to bring in Dan Roberts for a little bit more on this because of course he follows everything a bit coin for us."
NEUT1|And then when you take a look at Bitcoin's momentum, it's really incredible right now.
NEUT2|What is it?
BULL3|Well on its way to 21,000 excitement around this certainly is not fading.
NEUT4|What's going on here this time around?
BULL5|Yeah Sean, it's interesting you mentioned Bitcoin finally has surpassed $20,000 per coin that had been seen for months and months as a real resistance level.
BULL6|Then of course today it not only hit that Mark, but surged past it.
NEUT7|The high that we've seen on Yahoo Finance which uses Coinmarketcap data was 20,820 today.
NEUT8|So way past that 20,000 mark, a consensus all time high for sure as I always caveats viewers, different exchanges give different prices, but today definitely a massive new kind of ceiling for Bitcoin.
BULL9|We talked about this for the last few weeks and months we see a big rise in 2020.
NEUT10|Depends whom you ask.
NEUT11|There's been institutional investment more and more Wall Street firms getting in as well as individual hedge fund names.
NEUT12|Kind of changing their tune publicly about Bitcoin.
NEUT13|In fact, just a few hours ago someone from Guggenheim was on Bloomberg TV saying that he thinks by their calculations Bitcoin eventually should be worth 400,000 coin.
NEUT14|I don't know how soon will see that, but you have seen a lot of kind of traditional finance types saying we're now allocating some slice of our portfolio to digital assets so.
NEUT15|The tune is changing.
NEUT16|There's the institutional side.
NEUT17|Then of course there's the consumer facing side, PayPal and Square.
NEUT18|Those are the two biggest names to really publicly buy in.
NEUT19|Of course, where added Bitcoin buying to its cash app way back in 2018.
NEUT20|But then this year Square also went ahead and just bought $50 million worth of Bitcoin as an asset on its balance sheet.
NEUT21|PayPal of course in October announces going to add Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to its digital wallet, along with Venmo, which PayPal owns and then finally shot it.
NEUT22|Just today.
NEUT23|I'd add into the mix visa a lot more attention has been on PayPal and Square.
BULL24|But Visa also has kind of quietly allowed partnerships for a number of Bitcoin Rewards, credit and debit cards, and I reached out to Visa.
NEUT25|They said they have ventures in the works with 25 different cryptocurrency companies.
NEUT26|I don't think it's received as much attention because it really hasn't been as kind of a public facing as the PayPal and square stuff.
NEUT27|Well, Daniel beat us to the punch 'cause we want to talk about.
NEUT28|Why is it such a big deal for Visa as you've written about in today's story on Yahoo Finance, they did this very quietly.
NEUT29|It's almost like pay no attention to that.
NEUT30|You know man or woman behind the curtain.
NEUT31|Why is it such a huge deal that visa?
NEUT32|I mean, it seems a little obvious, but.
BULL33|Yeah, I mean I agree with you, though it has been quiet.
NEUT34|That's how I phrase it and I think that's by design.
NEUT35|You know, credit arguably to PayPal and Square for being willing to be so public about it.
NEUT36|You know, some of these Bitcoin Rewards, debit or credit cards?
NEUT37|They all need visas sign off in order to launch them so they all represent a partnership visa, but it's not the same as you know PayPal, saying we're adding Bitcoin to our PayPal and Venmo app, so it's not as much kind of a visa solo initiative.
NEUT38|It's more of a partnership, so I'd argue it's been done more quietly.
BULL39|That said, let's keep in mind Visa is bigger both by market cap and by 2019 revenue than PayPal and Square combined.
BULL40|So even if it's been a little more quiet, the cryptocurrency friendly steps by Visa have huge potential here.
NEUT41|All right, Dan Roberts, as always.
NEUT42|Thank you.
NEUT43|We have to keep a close eye on Bitcoin because certainly nothing seems to be stopping this move to the upside in Roberts.
BULL44|"Thanks so much for joining us."""
