NEUT0|"""This partner this this product?"
NEUT1|I mean in this product seems like it has the best of every single one of us of all your competitors.
NEUT2|But at the same time your competitors are pretty entrenched.
NEUT3|So how does RingCentral crack in to a zoom client or crack into a teams client?
BULL4|And because you may have a superior product but the other guys have pretty good sales forces and reputations.
NEUT5|Well, yes, so do we.
BULL6|We have pretty good reputation as well.
NEUT7|Pretend I Salesforce we do have a unique set of partnerships.
NEUT8|You already mentioned a few, but we can't focus like AT&T, British Telecom.
NEUT9|Vodafone is, you know mentioned Avaya Alcatel Lucent Autos etc etc.
NEUT10|We do have direct path where the lead you chaos unified communications as a service provider to upwards of 180,000,000.
BULL11|On premise PBX users through this partnerships with Vodafone that we've just announced just now we have just added another 3035 million user opportunity so we're doing pretty well as well.

NEUT18|Some are traveling and.
NEUT19|People still need to work at the teams cohesively and efficiently and with our new introduction today of RingCentral Glip, what we did is we took all of the countries and countries of features of high value features that other people are charging for.
