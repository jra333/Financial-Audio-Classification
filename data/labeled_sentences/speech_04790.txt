NEUT0|"""Here's what we're watching with trading underway in London."
BEAR1|Global equities under the pump in the wake of Wall Street falling sharply overnight.
BEAR2|US shares suffered their biggest one day drop since October.
BEAR3|Doubts over the much anticipated U.S. tax reform and other physical measures are growing as a Trump administration faces a fight over health care after a strong run for equities and credit.
BULL4|Since the Trump trade invigorated investors, it's hardly a surprise to finally see a pullback in markets.
BEAR5|Plenty of people have become worried about low levels of volatility.
BULL6|That smacked of growing complacency as equities, the dollar and oil slip havens led by the likes of the yen, Gold and U.S. Treasury debt are prospering.
NEUT7|A big question.
NEUT8|How resilient will investors be?
BULL9|Plenty of money has been pumped into stocks and credit via the Trump reflation trade.
NEUT10|However, Congress will likely take its time over tax reform and passing fiscal spending bills.
BULL11|The coming months could well test the patience of investors and those very lofty U.S. equity valuations.
NEUT12|What will be interesting, however?
BULL13|"Is whether markets quickly buy on the dip as this will illustrate faith in the Trump trade has plenty of long term support."""
