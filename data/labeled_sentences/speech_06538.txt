BEAR3|Gbpusd hitter more than seven week low yesterday, extending a two week slide.
BEAR4|The RSI is currently bearish well below 50 and is currently around 34.
BEAR5|The Stochastics are even more bearish as they've fallen into oversold territory.
BULL6|Below 20 though, the percentage K line has just crossed about the percentage decline and is trending up, indicating a near term.
BULL7|Upside correction could be on its way.
NEUT8|Should this happen.
BEAR9|The 1.22 handle could serve as a psychological barrier.
BEAR10|A break above this level would I another potential key level debt held in the past, namely the 1.23 mark further up the 50 day moving average will likely can get in the way of cable reaching.
NEUT11|The one point 24 level.
BEAR12|On the downside, the area around one point 2130 and the 1.21 level has been a recent support area and has acted as support several times since last October.
BULL13|So a breach of this area would significantly strengthen the downside momentum and would bring interview January's 32 year lower one point 1986 in the bigger picture.
BEAR14|However, the outlook remains very much bearish as price action is still well below the 200 day moving average.
BULL15|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
