NEUT0|"""Earn a lot of people listening, saying, well, wait a second."
NEUT1|You have these inspection reconditioning center.
NEUT2|Put $1000 into a car.
NEUT3|Be are the people were watching saying I've never had any work done for less than 2500.
NEUT4|How are you able to do that?
NEUT5|Also, so these inspection centers are really cool facilities, you know they're generally on around 7200 acres.
BEAR6|There maybe 5000 cars in the ground.
NEUT7|It's basically a big assembly line where you can kind of think of it as a remanufacturing facility so the cars come in there, inspected.
NEUT8|We figure out all the different parts that are on the car, and the options are on the cars that we can merchandise for customers.
NEUT9|They go through whatever work needs to be done, gets done, will fix dents, will fix windshields, will fix anything is wrong, mechanically, will photograph the car and then we put it up on the website for customers to buy.
NEUT10|And so you're going through that.
BULL11|Assembly line process enables us to save a lot of money versus the traditional way of getting your car fixed.
NEUT12|OK, that that makes a lot of sense.
NEUT13|At the same time, despite your growth, you're saying you're only point 7% of the entire market.
NEUT14|So that's a truly remarkable thing about this market.
NEUT15|So an amazing numbers that there's about 40 million used cars sold every single year, and so you know in the fourth quarter we sold about 72,000 cars.
NEUT16|And when you do the math on that, that put us at about .7% of the market.
NEUT17|At the same time, we're the second largest seller of used cars in the country after just eight years in operation.
BULL18|And so I think it's a pretty remarkable thing that, you know, we're the second largest, but we're still only point 7%, so there's obviously a lot of room for growth now.
NEUT19|We've had a picture up.
NEUT20|Showing where the vending machines inspection reconditioning centers are?
NEUT21|I mean I look at is it fair to say that you may only be?
NEUT22|I don't know half the country, maybe even less.
NEUT23|So we have direct delivery, which means he will deliver a car to a customer in a branded hauler with the uniform carve an employee that will walk you through how everything works.
BULL24|We do that to a little more than 70% of the population by the end of the year we expect that to be approximately 80% of the population and then over time will keep growing from there.
NEUT25|But then for those customers live outside of our direct service area, we will use third party shippers to ship the car to a customer if they'd like to buy it.
