BEAR0|"""Shares of Walmart falling again today."
BEAR1|The stock is now down 12% since reporting earnings two weeks ago.
NEUT2|Karen, you stepped in though.
NEUT3|Yes, I slept in both Walmart and Target.
NEUT4|I think you know it's trading at about a market multiple and I think that disappointment about them spending capital on their business doesn't really make sense to me.
BULL5|They've both proven to be good stewards of capital.
BULL6|The return on invested capital has been good, so I think they absolutely deserve the benefit of the doubt and you know, it's trading as a.
NEUT7|It's not a re open trade and so I think that's part of what's going on here.
NEUT8|And yet I think they'll be a beneficiary of reopen trades and stimulus is their customers have money to spend.
NEUT9|And they shift from spending household goods to things that are higher margins.
NEUT10|So I like them both.
NEUT11|I think they're overdone, and I think you know who else is probably buying.
NEUT12|Walmart is Walmart and target of it for target as well.
NEUT13|Yeah, like him both.
BULL14|Good point there Tim.
NEUT15|Would you be a buyer?
NEUT16|I'm I'm logged so as Karen says when you go home long you're a buyer and I I'm a big believer.
NEUT17|In the Walmart story, both the ecommerce story and how they've they've added that multiple part of their business.
NEUT18|And it's not just groceries and I also agree that stimulus is a massive windfall for Walmart.
NEUT19|People will be going into Walmart to spend, and they may actually enjoy being in the store if they have a vaccine.
NEUT20|So I like the multiple.
NEUT21|It's hardly expensive to itself.
NEUT22|It should be rating on Walmart plus, and therefore I think the.
NEUT23|Altemose moving our guy.
NEUT24|Do you like Walmart or would you go to a retailer that may be more leveraged to reopening one?
NEUT25|Maybe that didn't do as well during the pandemic really benefits from an actual brick and mortar experience.
NEUT26|Now I think this Walmart level 128 if we remember this is where we broke out from.
NEUT27|It was a prior all time high and I'll say the one thing about Walmart.
NEUT28|You know they were selling those, those those those whiteboards that we use for like $5 a board.
NEUT29|But what I notice they put smart boards out and I was able to get mine for $35 and I thought it's like look at me getting over on the Walmart so maybe they're not as smart as I thought.
NEUT30|128 year level quickly take a look at MasterCard.
BEAR31|It scares me a little here.
BULL32|Traded up to the levels we saw in late August early September.
BEAR33|Last year similar felt around this 370 level.
NEUT34|Just something to keep in mind, but Walmart at 128 I think the risk reward is very good grass you wanna talk, Walmart target or some other stock that you just want to throw in there like I did?
BULL35|Yeah, yeah exactly so.
NEUT36|So I'll talk Walmart it.
NEUT37|I think the problem they have with Walmart, Anna, Costco, two names that I that I actually do like, they're treated in their traded like Bond proxies.
NEUT38|So when you start to see bond prices, rollover and yields rise, these stocks do the same thing.
NEUT39|They roll over and they don't have.
NEUT40|You don't have pricing power and what I mean by that is they can't raise prices.
BEAR41|They're known for low prices, so when their clientele comes in and is battling with higher gas prices, they get burned on both sides of it.
NEUT42|I want to a retailer that has pricing power.
BULL43|Capri Holdings has that Anne has European exposure CPR I. I'm still long it incredible move and going much higher.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
