NEUT0|"""Hey, what's going on everyone PK investing here?"
NEUT1|I'm sure by now you've all heard about Apple's upcoming stock split, so I figured I'd throw together a little educational piece about what stock quotes are.
NEUT2|Now, without further ado, let's get into it on Thursday, July 30th, Apple announced that its board had approved a four for one split, which would be completed by the end of August.
NEUT3|When I first started investing.
NEUT4|Let's always confuse me because of the terminology in the phrasing.
NEUT5|It's a simple idea to graph, but it might be harder for a new investor, so I've put together a little visual to make it easier to understand.
NEUT6|So we know that Apple declared a four for one split.
NEUT7|To make it easier for yourself to understand, think about it this way.
NEUT8|An investor will get 4 shares for everyone share.
NEUT9|I don't know if it's just me, but reading it to myself that way makes it much easier to comprehend.
NEUT10|Now let's talk more about what the market implications of a split would be.
NEUT11|To do that, let's think about it like a pizza.
NEUT12|If you have a whole pizza and you slice it up into eight or even 12 slices, you'll still have a whole pizza.
NEUT13|But now if someone grab this, life will only get an eighth or a 12th of the entire pizza.
NEUT14|The same is true for this.
NEUT15|Apple split Apple is taking each stock or East pizza and slicing it up into four pieces.
NEUT16|Or four slices.
NEUT17|The value of Apple's market cap or the value of all the chairs combined is still going to be the same, but now the stock is more affordable on a per share basis and that leads me to my next point, which is why Apple declared a flip.
NEUT18|Before the split, each share of Apple was trading at over $400 for a hotshot millionaire 400 a share isn't too bad, but for the average investor, $400 is a significant chunk of cash.
NEUT19|Of course, with the increasing popularity of fractional shares, the price of 1 individual share doesn't matter too much, but we often seem to forget that fractional shares or only really widespread in the United States.
NEUT20|Many other countries still only have the ability to invest in whole chareth someone in another country wouldn't be able to invest in Apple until they could afford to shell out over $400 per share.
NEUT21|But here in the United States I can buy a dollars worth of Apple.
NEUT22|Everyday and not pay a single fee.
NEUT23|How's that thing go?
NEUT24|An Apple a day keeps the doctor away.
NEUT25|Well, in this case a dollar, an Apple a day keeps the job away.
NEUT26|Apple, what would bring the price per share down to around $100 an while?
NEUT27|That's still a lot of money.
BULL28|It's definitely more affordable than $400 per share.
BULL29|This increased liquidity is what Apple is trying to achieve.
BULL30|They think that the reduced price per share will look more appealing to investors, encourage more people to invest in their company.
NEUT31|Let me know what you guys think about this, but do you think Apple share price is going to break 500 before the split?
NEUT32|Or do you think there is going to be a spike after the split?
NEUT33|Only time will tell.
NEUT34|Until then take care and I hope to speak with you against.
NEUT35|I'm not a financial advisor.
NEUT36|Investing always involved risk.
