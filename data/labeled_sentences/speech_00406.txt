BULL0|"""Good morning, believe nation."
NEUT1|Today's messages share the credit over to you.
NEUT2|Michael Bloomberg.
NEUT3|I wake up every morning.
NEUT4|You never wanted to beat your competition.
NEUT5|No, I want to be successful.
NEUT6|You said teammates versus competition, right?
NEUT7|Yeah, but but I mean, I've Salomon brothers all those times you work with other people.
NEUT8|One of the ways.
NEUT9|Incidentally, Stephanie, to really get ahead is to give credit to somebody else when I say oh I didn't do it, Lloyd did that and he involved me.
NEUT10|Let me tell you, I'm telling everybody it's me as well, but I've now made a friend Anne.
NEUT11|You respect me because I've shared the credit and if you say no me, me, me, I I nobody likes you.
BEAR12|And nobody respects you and they think you are exaggerating everything.
NEUT13|But to the extent you give credit to else was the thought of are they exaggerating?
NEUT14|Doesn't even come up.
NEUT15|I really love this message because I think as entrepreneurs we're offering on the front lines, right?
NEUT16|We're offering doing the glorious, glamorous part of the business right?
NEUT17|We do a lot of the crap stuff as well, right?
NEUT18|We do a lot of behind the scenes, you know, 800 hour work week.
NEUT19|Stop that nobody sees.
NEUT20|But we also get to do the frontline stuff.
NEUT21|The glamorous stuff, the stuff that gets attention, right?
NEUT22|We're the ones who are in the media were the ones getting the praise from the customers.
NEUT23|You know, the best part of my day is waking up and doing the YouTube comments and seeing the praise that comes from you guys on the videos.
BULL24|It makes me feel good.
NEUT25|It makes you feel like what I'm doing is important.
NEUT26|I think a challenging in building a team is that your team doesn't always get to see that stuff, right?
NEUT27|The programmer was working on your website.
NEUT28|Does he get to see that material?
NEUT29|That's coming out?
NEUT30|You know the people who are engineering your product?
NEUT31|Do they get to see the results from the customers often?
BEAR32|It's unknown, so there's this huge disconnect.
NEUT33|And when people can feel like the work that they're doing is important and valuable and is helping improve people's lives, then they're much more connected to your business.
NEUT34|And I've always tried to be conscious of involving my entire team in the things that I'm doing and let them know that their work adds value and has meaning.
NEUT35|One of the things that I do is every Friday I look through some of the more special comments that have come in from the YouTube channel ones at somebody's shares.
NEUT36|Just a life changing story about how our videos are really helping them.
NEUT37|Through some really tough moment in their life, how it helped them believe in themselves, how to launch something amazing.
NEUT38|Or it could be somebody actually thinking the team and saying, hey I want to thank you and your team for all these videos that you're making.
NEUT39|I find one comment every week and then I scheduled to go to my team on Monday so they start their day with a warm common coming from the team.
NEUT40|And I think it's great because a lot of the people who may have worked in other jobs before.
NEUT41|They've never seen that kind of recognition or praise or wariness, and they feel like.
NEUT42|They're disconnected from what the mission of the businesses, because they're just focused so much on the code or the back end processes.
NEUT43|And so I think it's super important to share the credit.
NEUT44|Involve your team.
NEUT45|Let them know what they're doing is important, and it not only makes them feel good in value and a part of the team, I think it makes you feel good too.
BULL46|Like I love sharing stuff with my team London over that they contributed to something really meaningful and important.
NEUT47|So the question of the day today is, how do you share the credit?
NEUT48|Or do you share the credit?
NEUT49|Leave it in the comments below.
NEUT50|I'm going to join in discussion.
BULL51|Thank you guys so much for watching.
BULL52|Have an amazing day.
NEUT53|Continue to believe and I'll see you again tomorrow morning for another shot of espresso.
NEUT54|"We go."""
