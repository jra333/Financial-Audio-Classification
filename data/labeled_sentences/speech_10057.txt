NEUT0|"""Hey, how's it going?"
NEUT1|Everyone over to update you guys on HP R as they did go into after hours being on halts an it is very rare that a stock goes into after hours being on halt.
NEUT2|So I want to analysis on what I'd be doing if I was in after hours going on halt and what I'll be doing going into tomorrow as we do see a possible nice day trade.
NEUT3|If it does break out of our existence.
NEUT4|I'm sure you guys exactly what that looks like and again we do want to make sure we do have justified reasoning for every trade we make and that is why I like going over there.
NEUT5|Very simple indicators that I see traders missing out on every single day and I want you guys to learn because honestly I much love for you guys and again much love story that's been in the comment section.
NEUT6|And if you haven't subscribed, we do go out Monday through Friday on entries and breakouts, so be looking for those.
NEUT7|Now let's go right into our next favorite play as a possible break out.
NEUT8|This one is HP R. Now they did go into after hours ending the day in on halt and they did on the day at 10 thirty 1083 and we do have a possible break out now again.
NEUT9|They did come all the way up to around 12:13.
NEUT10|They did get Wick down.
BEAR11|They do have a halt again at 1083.
NEUT12|Now.
BEAR13|This one could possibly blow up going into tomorrow.
BEAR14|I know it did go on to halt around $12.00 and then it came down to around $10 and it went on halt again now.
NEUT15|Would you see volume confirmation that could possibly break out?
NEUT16|Now what we are going to be looking out for is our volume confirmation.
BULL17|Now we do have less volume still that came in previously at a higher price, so again we are going to want confirmation on the volume here.
BULL18|We do have volume that has been coming in on average.
NEUT19|We have about 690,000 volume and we ended the day with about 3,000,000.
NEUT20|That's about four times as much volume as an average.
BULL21|So again we do see a possible breakout if this volume does continue and confirm.
BULL22|But however, if it does not, it will definitely sell off.
NEUT23|Now if I was in this play already, I definitely would.
NEUT24|Be watching out pretty market.
NEUT25|I think this is pretty obvious.
BEAR26|If I was playing premarket, if it started to sell off and it went down below a stop loss around 887, I would be selling off as that does look like it would be on its previous sell off point.
NEUT27|But however if it does break above 1213 and it does break in above this week, around 12, Thirteen, 83.
NEUT28|This one would be a nice day trade again.
NEUT29|We do see what GI GM is doing after hours we saw with Pixie was trying to do.
BEAR30|We have many NFT plays that have been going crazy.
NEUT31|HFB we did a lot of issues on them yesterday but however.
BEAR32|This one is the next possible rent up as again they are on halts.
NEUT33|We're going to see if this one breaks out premarket, an if you guys don't have pre marking your wait until open then definitely the same situation.
NEUT34|But however, you're definitely going to see what happens premarket as if this one does already go too crazy then you want to be careful as it could sell off going into open.
BULL35|So again, HPR is definitely watch.
NEUT36|It is another NFT play.
BULL37|If it does break out then we could possibly see another 200% Gainer as we have been seeing the last few days through these NFT plays.
NEUT38|But again hope you guys gonna join in breakouts much love story in the comments as usual an.
NEUT39|Again, if you have a watch list during the comment section, I love talking to you guys and again if you do come in there, I am going to be sending you guys my daily watch List an again because honestly, how much love for you guys.
NEUT40|I want you guys to do is get it possible we are going over the RSI Mcdee and many other indicators throughout the day, but for now we're going to focus on volume because this one is based on hype.
BULL41|This one is not as much of a technical play, you could see the sell pressure decrease.
BULL42|You can see the by pressure is increasing, we just need to continue on increasing and get that volume confirmation.
NEUT43|But however like I said.
NEUT44|"HPR is definitely watch for tomorrow and again, God bless you all and I will see you guys in the next video."""
