NEUT0|"""What is the sense that you get how you look at the markets?"
NEUT1|The spike that came in and what essentially is happening?
BULL2|See the overall trend for the market over past two days has been positive, but today if you look at it, we got rejected from 14,850 yard level which happened to be the upper end of the Bollinger Band also.
BEAR3|What is happening is after a sharp decline that we saw towards 14,350 there it was a sharp rally again toward 14,855 thing market needs some consolidation.
NEUT4|It's going to be trading in a broad range.
BEAR5|It's not going to give you any kind of a strong directional movement for now, and especially bang if he had underperformed drastically.
NEUT6|We have not seen any kind of positive traction, so if one is to trade nifty index, I would use.
NEUT7|I need it towards the level of 14,670 as a buying opportunity again for a sort of move towards 14,800.
NEUT8|So I'm going to play that range and on the downside, putting the other 590 is going to act as an important support as far as bad nippies.
BEAR9|Some of the important support comes to the lows, which was made around 33,370 levels.
NEUT10|That level needs to remain protected if that gets given away then.
NEUT11|That is kind of concern.
NEUT12|On the upside, we need a break.
NEUT13|This is you break about 34,300 feet, fail to break about that level.
NEUT14|I think we're stuck in a range in dynasty and wait for a DC levels to be taken out for taking a trade in that specific direction.
NEUT15|Right, you know when we just talk about what's happening with the bank Nifty?
NEUT16|I mean, can you just diversify more because of late?
NEUT17|You've seen PSU's going into different direction private going into different direction.
NEUT18|Maybe NBF sees going into different direction.
NEUT19|What is your view on the same?
BEAR20|Absolutely I can completely agree with you, because at one and we can see is BI has been a drastic underperformer, it has continued to be a major lezard continue to drift on the downside at one and you can see that an on the other end.
BULL21|ICC Bank has also been moving lower but I think private sector banks can start to our performance.
NEUT22|PSU banks I I think.
BEAR23|There will be profit booking and there can be some underperformance from that that side as far as India sees are concerned.
NEUT24|Again a very similar story is what we are seeing.
NEUT25|Bajaj Finance is this talk that I would prefer buying if I want to buy from the NBF C space and I would prefer shorting something like I bull housing finance because that has been an underperformer so I'll buy the out performers and I'll shortly underperformers what is very important for us to see now is whether leaders like SBI can start bucking the trend.
NEUT26|Start moving up site so that Bang implicant stabilized.
BEAR27|If Sbisa Ntsu continue to show profit booking then I think there can be lower levels on banking index that we can see.
BULL28|OK understood, thanks Ashish for that.
NEUT29|Well, on that note, we'll just have to slip into a very short break.
NEUT30|"We'll be right back with more."""
