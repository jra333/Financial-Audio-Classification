BULL0|"""Thank you for joining me."
NEUT1|I'm Alex and I want to talk about serious logic so seriously.
NEUT2|Logic makes computer chips, which means mostly for cell phones, but also kind of sword a little bit for computers, not mainstream machines, though really they focus mainly on graphics and some chips, and they're actually in a lot of smart phones right now.
NEUT3|Current price is $60.69 nice which gives the market cap of $3.5 billion.
NEUT4|Dividend is zero.
NEUT5|I don't expect that to change anytime soon.
BULL6|Current revenue $1.3 billion earnings $159 million, both up significantly.
NEUT7|Revenue actually slightly more than it looks, but I don't know where to run things so I don't have to have the numbers completely covering the whole screen so you know, going to just have to deal with it currently is 2021 for PES20, which is actually pretty decent.
NEUT8|Obviously a lot of tech stocks right now have PE, but like 950 if you want to look at Tesla.
NEUT9|Total assets $1.6 billion.
NEUT10|Total liabilities $636 million, which gives them total stockholders equity of $1.3 billion, which is not great necessarily.
NEUT11|But considering their market cap is only $3.5 billion and stockholders equity of $1.3 billion is pretty nice and you can expect them to actually.
NEUT12|Discount things.
NEUT13|At a reasonable rate, so I wouldn't be too surprised if the asset value is actually close to the current value of their assets.
NEUT14|So overall I would say that with the PE being where it is, I think it's pretty interesting stock for a lot of people.
NEUT15|Obviously, growth investors don't really find the stock interesting right now because I knew smartphones are really not something that people buy during a, you know.
BEAR16|Global recession and that might be a bit of a problem, but I don't expect that to be a long term problem.
NEUT17|So if you intend on owning the stock for awhile.
BULL18|I'm guessing that kind of sorted doesn't make you a growth investor, but so I think it's probably still a pretty decent stock, especially stock to diversify into.
NEUT19|So overall, like as a growth stock, I don't think I would recommend it at this at this time.
NEUT20|For dividend investor.
NEUT21|I definitely also wouldn't recommend this at this time because there is no definite for value investor.
BULL22|The balance sheet looks pretty nice.
NEUT23|The P looks pretty nice.
BULL24|The revenue and earnings are growing and so I think overall for value investors this is a pretty decent stock and especially with tech stocks doing as well as they are currently finding someone something with APE of 20 or 21 is.
NEUT25|Pretty hard these days, especially in this sector.
NEUT26|So definitely look into this one and see if there's something you like and that's it for me.
