BULL0|"""So since I last talk about this talk, this talk is up by 20%, although it's a small amount of gain, but the trend has actually started moving on the upside, and that is very important."
NEUT1|So I love friends.
BULL2|Welcome to my channel and thanks for watching this video.
NEUT3|Friends in this video we're going to discuss about the weekly chart of Tonix Pharmaceuticals holding and as you can see here.
NEUT4|The stock is taking support in between these two consecutive support levels and this will probably be our final support level, so you'll have your immediate support level at $0.53 and you'll have your last support level at $0.36.
NEUT5|Now if the stock falls below .361, should not carry any further position, that should be clear.
NEUT6|But as the stocks is holding these two consecutive levels, the levels which we're going to see on the outside will be in between.
NEUT7|You will have these two levels on the upside, so we will have our first target at 2.3 dollars.
NEUT8|Then we will have our next target at 4.3 dollars, so this will be the targets that we're looking at for the time being.
NEUT9|But if you're counting it on a percentage terms, it is.
BULL10|380%, which is a very handsome amount of gain if the stock moves in the same way.
NEUT11|So although it has moved very slowly but the start has actually happened and if it holds above .53 then you will have 2.3 and 4.3 consecutive targets on the upside.
NEUT12|As I told you, this will not be the final target, but at least you will have to made a base before moving or jumping.
NEUT13|On the upside, in the long term.
NEUT14|So this is the end of the video.
NEUT15|If you like this content to share your thoughts in the comment section and subscribe my channel.
NEUT16|"Lastly, take care of her family and friends."""
