BEAR0|"""With the pandemic receding public health officials and politicians will renew their mistaken destructive war against E cigarettes."
NEUT1|They must be resisted.
NEUT2|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead where you get the insights you need to help navigate this turbulent world.
BULL3|Thankfully, the terrible pandemic is ebbing with the availability of vaccines and highly effective therapeutics, which means the wrong headed war waged by various authorities and pressure groups against vaping will be resumed with renewed intensity.
NEUT4|The attacks must be met with truthful counter attacks.
NEUT5|The facts are on the side of E cigarettes.
BEAR6|For unfathomable reasons vaping has been equated with regular tobacco smoking.
NEUT7|The opposite is true vaping is the best antidote to cigarette smoking.
NEUT8|E cigarettes are 95% less harmful than traditional smokes.
NEUT9|E cigarettes don't contain tobacco.
NEUT10|Vaping allows users to inhale nicotine without the carbon monoxide and other dreadful substances.
NEUT11|That makes cigarettes so lethal, especially to the lungs.
NEUT12|This is why, in contrast to the US, British health authorities promote vaping as a much preferred alternative to cigarettes.
NEUT13|Anti vapors in this country claimed E cigarettes are a gateway to taking up tobacco smoking.
BEAR14|They cite the surge of vaping among teenagers, but they conveniently overlook the fact that teenage cigarette smoking has plummeted over the years, from 16% to under 6%.
NEUT15|Of course you shouldn't be inhaling any kind of substances into your lungs, including marijuana, but vaping is by far the least harmful way to do it.
BULL16|Moreover, as the British have noted, they ping is a highly effective tool for giving up cigarettes, far more successful than patches.
NEUT17|Chewing gums and other anti cigarette aids.
NEUT18|While some local governments like San Francisco have prohibited E cigarette sales outright, anti vapers have focused their efforts on banning flavored E cigarettes.
NEUT19|On the theory that the unflavored variety make some distinctly unattractive to would be users.
NEUT20|The FDA took this approach last summer in banning flavored E cigarettes, but a loophole allows all flavors to be sold in disposable devices that cannot be refilled.
NEUT21|The state of California last year ban retail sales of flavored E cigarettes.
NEUT22|No loophole here, as well as flavored tobacco products such as menthol cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.
NEUT23|Exempt or pipe tobacco.
NEUT24|Certain cigars and hookahs.
NEUT25|Why, who knows?
NEUT26|But California voters will decide in a referendum next year whether or not to overturn that law.
NEUT27|They should decisively rebuke these latter day prohibitionists.
NEUT28|The anti cigarette forces should cease.
NEUT29|Their fiction filled scare tactics and take up educational campaigns on the virtues of leaving your lungs unmolested by any kind of foreign substances.
NEUT30|I'm Steve Forbes.
BULL31|Thanks for listening.
BULL32|"Do sending your comments and suggestions and I look forward to being with you soon again."""
