NEUT0|"""Hi fools, I'm Dan Caplinger, Motley Fool contributor and I'm here today to talk about whether the stock market is overdue for a big plunge."
NEUT1|Now recently as you know, the Dow Jones Industrials and the S&P 500 have successively hit many new records over the past several months, and that has many investors worried that we're overdue for a big pullback in the market, so to bring real numbers into the equation, I decided to look back at the history of the S&P 500.
NEUT2|To see just how many times we've seen corrections of five percent, 10%, and 20% to see if current conditions are particularly unusual.
BULL3|Now looking back over the past hundred years or so on average, you would expect to see corrections of 5% or more, about three times each year.
NEUT4|More substantial corrections of 10% or more usually happen about once annually, and when you're talking about full fledged bear markets.
BEAR5|Of 20% declines or more.
NEUT6|Usually you see one of those about every 3 1/2 years or so, so comparing that to the situation that we face now over the past four years since the bottom or bottom of the market in 2009, we've seen stocks rise substantially more than doubling, and so let's take a look and see what kinds of Corrections we've seen recently.
NEUT7|Now the most recent 5% correction took place last November.
BEAR8|So we're a little bit past if we see three corrections every year, that's about six months ago compared to about four months on average.
NEUT9|So a little bit overdue, but not all that far overdue.
NEUT10|As far as a 10% correction is concerned, the last one of those we saw was in August of 2011, so that's coming up on almost two years at this point.
NEUT11|And that's a pretty big deal.
BEAR12|The one thing, though, that correction was actually pretty big.
BEAR13|It didn't quite make the 20% mark.
NEUT14|But it came pretty close between 17% and 18% and that really is something you know when it's a deeper correction.
NEUT15|It kind of gets more weight, so perhaps arguably you could say that we're overdue for a correction.
NEUT16|Now.
NEUT17|The big question though, is does it really matter?
NEUT18|The real thing for long term investors to understand is that corrections happen, and there's really nothing that you can do about it whether you're invested in the Dow and the S&P 500.
NEUT19|In small cap indexes, international or domestic, it really doesn't matter what you have to do is prepare yourself for the inevitable bumps in the road and just reassure yourself with the fact that stock markets usually come back after they after they have their corrections, is part of a healthy long term market to learn more about investing, please feel free to look around fool.com for more for more articles.
