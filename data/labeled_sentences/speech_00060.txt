BULL0|"""Neo stock ticker symbol NIO sonio after this really violent downtrend that we had here all the way to the low of 32 had made a recovery all the way up to almost the 46 level and currently is has at 4335 going up on Friday 4.13%."
BULL1|So Friday was a very nice day for the stock.
NEUT2|We can see it it closed the day before it.
NEUT3|Around 41.
NEUT4|Area disclaimer I have a nice position in Neo and with all my buying and selling it's around 40 now.
NEUT5|The cost basis so I'm really not up on this position that much I got in a little bit late to the party.
NEUT6|I was more looking at Tesla at the time but this is the current situation with Neil we have here a consolidation.
NEUT7|It seems in between these two areas of the 46 and 40.
NEUT8|About the past week or so you can see it went up a little bit and then and declines a little bit concerning.
NEUT9|For me, it's kind of hard to see, but the you can see this line here is right above the current price.
NEUT10|The emhs this this line here.
NEUT11|So that's a little bit concerning to me that were under it right?
NEUT12|I would rather the candles be over the moving average, but if we can get up here maybe back to the 45 or 46 area next week and break out of this.
NEUT13|Area to that?
NEUT14|Or is the 50 area?
BULL15|Then we would be above it, so that would be a good indication the RSI is again at the 44 area.
BULL16|It's not too over, but not too oversold, so it's in a very good area.
NEUT17|You can see when it dipped down here it was in the 27 it was really oversold and will if we look back here let me move myself over.
NEUT18|You can see that it was on the over bot, so when it was 60 over yes over bot so 166 it was a little bit over bot and then it dipped down all the way to the oversold.
NEUT19|Now we're right in the middle so it's going to be a huge area here.
NEUT20|To see where the where the wind is blowing the Mac, D is looking good.
NEUT21|We have a green juicy candle here.
BEAR22|The blue is over the yellow, so that's telling us we're in an uptrend.
BULL23|We can see here a little bit concerning that we didn't continue to go up after here, but if we make higher highs and lower loads if we can get a higher high here.
NEUT24|Let's say to this area and the lows will be lower, even if it will be a little bit to the side, then it will be OK. We'd rather it be going up like this, but.
BULL25|We see a V recovery, but now it's kind of looking like maybe we're going to see a W. Maybe it will pull back here to the 37 area, right?
NEUT26|We might see a W and then maybe it will continue to go up so it's going to be interesting to see that if we look at this the Castle the red is over the purple so we don't see a change in the trend.
BULL27|So the train trend is currently looking like up to consolidation so hopefully we get some news next week or something that will push it up and continue to go.
BULL28|Up we always want stocks to go up.
NEUT29|We don't.
BEAR30|I don't really like stocks going down.
NEUT31|I'm never actually shorted.
NEUT32|I have bought puts but I've never shorted a stock in my life, so I'm just optimistic like that in my nature.
