NEUT0|"""Alright guys, so let's take a look at Coca Cola or ticker symbol KO."
NEUT1|So on a daily we can see in a shorter timeframe ranging back from early 2018.
BEAR2|We can see a bit of a downtrend.
NEUT3|So it's in.
BEAR4|It's going down here.
NEUT5|We can see how we're respecting this.
NEUT6|Is trend line and it looks like we're going to come back and retest right now, we're.
NEUT7|Testing the 200 day moving average.
NEUT8|That's a big.
NEUT9|Bing level to watch if you're if you're swing trading this consolidation.
NEUT10|You might look to sell a bit of your position here.
NEUT11|Or wait to see if we break above this trendline, and ultimately, the.
NEUT12|I think it's the 4445 level.
NEUT13|But most likely the way we've we've been trading this past year, we are going to come back down.
NEUT14|She see 43 or 40 twos.
NEUT15|So let's.
NEUT16|Actually, take a look at the monthly, which paints a clear picture in the long term.
BULL17|So long term we're still looking good.
NEUT18|Every time we break out, we consolidate nicely and break out.
BULL19|Consolidate breakout, consolidate.
NEUT20|And we can see how.
NEUT21|We are not consolidation right now.
BULL22|Just above the 50 day moving average.
BEAR23|And so history shows we do come down to tested 200, which right now is pretty low 33.
BEAR24|So if he did come down to test it, 200 would be a significant drop.
NEUT25|Percentage wise think 20%.
NEUT26|So that's the level to watch the 200 just to know so shorter timeframe.
BULL27|It looks nice, but we can touch this 200 at 33 the RSI looks good, consolidating just like.
NEUT28|The price action.
NEUT29|Let's actually just open it up a bit.
NEUT30|So we can see this is a big level here 4447.
BEAR31|Yeah, so 44 is a big level that we're just below, I believe 4447 forty 452 were just below this level right now.
NEUT32|Let me see.
NEUT33|Yeah, we're just with 4452, so.
NEUT34|That's a big level to watch.
NEUT35|If we can break above it and kind of break the shorter term downtrend that we're in.
NEUT36|"Yeah."""
