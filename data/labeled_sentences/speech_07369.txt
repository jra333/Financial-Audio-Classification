BULL0|"""Skinny in the weekly top 50."
NEUT1|Welcome back is 18th of March 2021.
BULL2|Thursday, the 4th day after we were at #8 Uni swap.
NEUT3|With the ticker only only so for Uni against BTC.
NEUT4|OK, and what's this?
NEUT5|I feel I feel like we already coming now I've mentioned this last week.
BEAR6|I said that there was really a double bearish divergance lower high sorry.
BEAR7|Higher high on the price but lower high on the Magdi lower high on the RSI, which means that potentially unisoft could be popping lower.
NEUT8|I feel like a move lower is coming on for you but you never know.
NEUT9|You know actually surprised us with another move higher right?
BULL10|And we could get ourselves a triple bearish.
NEUT11|Divergent sanin pump.
NEUT12|Then we do we.
BEAR13|Fall down for uni, swap against BTC.
NEUT14|So you need to be very very very careful about staying the trick for too long for using software can really count 5 weeks 12345 because you get another one and after that pump we should be dropping for unisoft.
BEAR15|There should be a brutal brutal drop coming on for the crypto currencies here I have a strange feeling that you will come in the month of April so we have about another 13 more days left in March.
NEUT16|To hit whatever targets that we have towards the upside and after that, the big collapse would come for the world of cryptocurrencies I suppose.
NEUT17|Yeah, so be very careful about going into a trade long for units up against BTC.
NEUT18|Alright, let's move on to using stop against USD T. But before that please give this video a like if you enjoyed it.
NEUT19|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think about Uni shopping documents.
NEUT20|Be low.
BEAR21|So for units up against USD T same freaking thing, you could really see higher high on the price, but a lower high.
BEAR22|Right, you can see lower highs under Mick D. Lower highs under RSI, so potentially potentially there could be a trend reversal coming on.
NEUT23|We don't really see the reversal chop it and yet, but yeah these are the signs that potentially things could start reversing lower shore because you pop higher, but I feel like the end is not too far away so even.
NEUT24|Want to?
BULL25|You can even come Pfeiffer on units up against USD T as well.
NEUT26|So you need to be very very very careful about going into a trade long for unisaw at this point of time, right?
BEAR27|Yeah, things could be dropping lower.
NEUT28|How much lower?
BEAR29|I have no idea, but there could be a deep drop coming.
NEUT30|Yeah, it could be a deep drop double digits, right?
NEUT31|And it could be 50%.
NEUT32|I don't know the things I don't know.
NEUT33|I don't have any clear chart patterns pointing towards a target yet, so I can't say for sure at this point of time things are still looking pretty perky.
NEUT34|If you don't look at the indicators, things will still look pretty OK. OK ish I would say.
BEAR35|But then again, if you look at indicators there is some weakness spotted on units up against USD.
NEUT36|So be very careful about going into a trade too soon.
NEUT37|I don't do anything I wouldn't do alright, I guess I see from my uni stop technical analysis.
BULL38|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL39|Hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT40|"I shall see you in the next video."""
