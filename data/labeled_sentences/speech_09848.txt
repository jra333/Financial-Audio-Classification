NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Back from the video today it is your boy will today I'll be talking about ticker symbol G HIV.
NEUT2|The stock has a lot of hype around it 'cause the merger.
NEUT3|The merger was approved tomorrow.
NEUT4|They do change their ticker symbol to UMW.
BULL5|And if you guys look at UMW is a pretty good company.
NEUT6|That is why I'm long on this stock and.
NEUT7|My average share is around $10.00, so if it does go back to $10 I will be getting more shares, but right now these three support lines is where I'm looking at.
NEUT8|As you can see, this last support line, which is my last defense.
NEUT9|So let's make this one red.
NEUT10|You guys can know and if you knew when I say last defense, that's just it falls below here and stays out here.
NEUT11|I turned bearish OK so miss you guys like the video.
NEUT12|Subscribe, turn on Post notifications, check out my Patreon page if you want to know when I'm buying and selling stocks.
NEUT13|OK, link down below.
NEUT14|So first support is 1138, second one is 1111 and last Defense 1086.
NEUT15|So as you can see this low look up here when the low comes the low was low as 10.
NEUT16|Five and I have this at 1086, almost perfect and look at the reaction it had after it hit that support bounced off right?
NEUT17|So like I said, I am longer term on this stock.
NEUT18|I do want the stock to go above 15 for sure and that is when I was probably start looking to exit a little bit of the position, but I will only exit about 50%.
NEUT19|I want to hold a 50% a little longer term like maybe a couple months to see how the company does after emerges and wants to start releasing profits and revenue and all that good stuff.
NEUT20|So that's what I'm really waiting for.
NEUT21|So all this intraday movement I don't really.
NEUT22|Engine two, I just keep you guys updated and where I'm looking at the stock.
NEUT23|But as you can see it did hold this so this is still bullish, right?
BULL24|Even though it did all this, I'm still bullish and held my levels very good today and it rejected it nicely.
BULL25|OK, which means there is some buying pressure as you can see it is up after hours so hopefully it starts going up slowly.
NEUT26|It doesn't need to shoot off like this.
NEUT27|This is just hype.
NEUT28|I'd rather it go up slowly like this, right?
BULL29|Nice healthy uptrend.
NEUT30|'cause this right here means hard pull back.
BEAR31|And went all the way to $14.00 and then dropped all the way to 11.
BEAR32|I don't want to see that I want to see a healthy uptrend maybe a little down.
BEAR33|Keep going up a little down.
NEUT34|Keep going up right.
NEUT35|We don't want to see this 'cause this just means a lot of hype so.
BULL36|These are the lowest I'm looking for and help the last defense, so I'm still bullish.
NEUT37|I'm still longer term bullish, so I don't look at the intraday moves.
NEUT38|And like I said, make sure you guys keep this a small percentage of your portfolio just in case it doesn't drop.
NEUT39|You won't be worried about it so much.
NEUT40|OK, you want to have patience?
NEUT41|Wait for the company to merge with them to get everything settled and then wait to see how the stock moves.
NEUT42|OK, I know the merger is tomorrow, but it might not pop off and my pop off next week, but we don't know.
NEUT43|We have to go by.
NEUT44|Their time we can go by our own time.
NEUT45|OK so just have some patience.
BULL46|Have these levels in your chart and I think we will be good so that's it for this video.
NEUT47|Notice the recommendation of our so anything.
NEUT48|"This educational purposes only so do not trade anything you see here in these videos and I'll catch you guys in the next one."""
