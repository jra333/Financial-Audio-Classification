NEUT0|"""One of the things they found is that a very high percentage of people are very price conscious, so."
NEUT1|That you know they they may become my cattle cars, but they put with brother be treated like a significant percentage would rather be treated that way.
NEUT2|An an fly for X then have far more legroom and more.
NEUT3|You know two abreast, all kinds of things and travel for X + 25% so.
NEUT4|To some extent they try to segment segment.
NEUT5|Have they pushed a little too far along those lines?
NEUT6|Well, it's seldom.
NEUT7|The customer was Alan, you know.
NEUT8|Basically, by flying you know that, and the customer would tell them by flying somewhere else.
NEUT9|But the problem is with airlines, you often don't have a choice more than 70% of the airlines flights that originate it out of Newark are united airline flights.
NEUT10|I don't have a choice when that's my home.
NEUT11|My home place to go, but some people.
NEUT12|I mean, we suggested to people.
NEUT13|Actually the.
NEUT14|Came to the Berkshire meeting because the prices went up a lot.
BULL15|The demand went up a lot, but I'm thousands and thousands and thousands of extra seats.
NEUT16|Airlines told me so.
NEUT17|I actually put in the report every year.
NEUT18|You can fly to Kansas City during the annual meeting.
NEUT19|Way cheaper than you can fly to Omaha and you can get a car there and be here in a couple of hours an.
NEUT20|A fair number of people actually do that.
NEUT21|You know that?
NEUT22|But people don't.
NEUT23|I mean that people have different preferences, but there's no question.
NEUT24|I mean, I would hate to run an airline.
NEUT25|People are traveling.
NEUT26|They're hoping to make a wedding.
NEUT27|They're hoping to make up business appointment.
NEUT28|It's important to them and I understand all of those issues.
NEUT29|I guess I'm asking you as the largest shareholder, it sounds like you have not had any conversations with Oscar Munoz.
NEUT30|So I'm asking you if it concerns you when reactions like this get the heads of these airlines called up in front of Congress, would that potentially change the investment strategy?
BEAR31|Even changing the strategy, it's bad.
NEUT32|I mean how bad it is.
NEUT33|But there is no way that you aren't going to read about some airline incidents.
NEUT34|Now.
NEUT35|The one thing going for the airlines is they become unbelievably safe.
NEUT36|I mean, I never dropped, but they have also worked Tord.
NEUT37|Having higher load factors when they have load factors in the.
NEUT38|You know, like they did in the past around 70.
NEUT39|I mean they they went bankrupt and they need high load factors and high load factors mean.
BEAR40|A fair amount of discomfort, and it has kept prices from going up, but as you point out, I have not read no commercial airline as Joe points out, not me, it's.
NEUT41|It's a job I don't want running an airline.
NEUT42|I guess the only question is do you think Congress would do anything that would make your investment less worthwhile?
NEUT43|They could.
NEUT44|I don't think it will likely, but the interesting thing about it is.
NEUT45|If you regulated the airlines, be regulated them.
NEUT46|You would have.
NEUT47|Well, whatever they decide to regulate, but you could have got more leg space you could have, you could have no overbooking.
NEUT48|I mean regulate all kinds of things.
BULL49|The cost will go up man.
NEUT50|And that's the tradeoff.
