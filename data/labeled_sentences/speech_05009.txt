NEUT3|Netflix said needs no introduction.
NEUT4|It is a very famous company.
NEUT5|They provide an entertainment service through their platform.
NEUT6|They offer a library of movies, documentaries and TV series, and they profit from the user subscription.
NEUT7|Netflix was founded in 1997, initiated Business model was very similar to Blockbuster and they were focused mainly on DVD sales or rental.
BULL8|Netflix was much smaller compared to Blockbuster, but by adapting to the changing market they destroy the competition with the introduction of streaming media today, Netflix as a market capitalization of 200.
BULL9|$48 billion and is leading the industry even if the competition is getting tougher because many other companies like for example Amazon are expanding into the entertainment industry a few days ago, Netflix released the last quarter financial reports and the shares price jumped up to $593.00, making new all time high.
NEUT10|But let's take a look at some numbers.
BULL11|The last quarter has been very positive.
BULL12|The company added 8.76 million paid subscribers.
BULL13|Meeting was set, forecast revenue increased in 2022, almost $25 billion, so an increase of approximately 24% compared to 2019.
BULL14|Net income increased strongly from 1.86 billion to 2.76 billion, an increase of approximately 48% year over year.
NEUT15|Let's move on to the balance sheet, the financial position.
NEUT16|It's a bit risky.
BULL17|We can see that the company increased the depth over the past years up to $16 billion.
NEUT18|And this adapter is very high compared to the equity long term liabilities exceed the short term assets, but they're covered by the long term assets.
NEUT19|Considering that the company is growing, this become a bit less relevant.
BEAR20|But if the business same future will have problems, everything could become more risky.
NEUT21|What are the main risks of investing in Netflix?
NEUT22|From my point of view, the main risk is the competition.
BULL23|The main competitors are Amazon, Disney and Apple, and even though Netflix are is leading the market, the competitors are great companies with great managements.
NEUT24|And with a lot of resources, so this is definitely something to watch out.
NEUT25|Another major risk, as we have already seen before, is that the company has a very high depth.
NEUT26|Let's take a look at the price action.
NEUT27|The shares are trading at $562.00 while I'm recording this video.
BULL28|The long term trend is positive and this is not a surprise considering the good fundamentals we come from.
NEUT29|This long consolidation in a range between 458 and $472.
BULL30|After the company released the earnings, the price jumped above this resistance and they decided to open a long position.
NEUT31|After this small pull back with a stop loss below this loss.
