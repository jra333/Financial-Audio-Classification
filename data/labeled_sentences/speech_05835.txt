BULL0|"""Hello ladies and gentlemen Davis here Hope you're doing well."
BULL1|Hope you're staying safe out there in this crazy market on January 29377 calls.
NEUT2|What I went with today.
NEUT3|This is a one minute chart now.
NEUT4|I always trade off the five minute chart.
NEUT5|I don't bother looking at a million charts to make one tray in order to best teach this.
NEUT6|Now I need one minute chart and the reason for that is fairly simple.
NEUT7|The exponential moving average lines.
NEUT8|I use three an 8 exponential moving average lines.
NEUT9|Those are weighted toward recent price action so they're going to move around all the time.
BEAR10|And the reason I went with calls today, as wild as this market is, you know, markets are up about 1% right now, but they might close down 2%.
NEUT11|Who knows, we'll find out, but you're going to see this candle right at the open.
NEUT12|This was taking place on a 5 minute candle too, but do you see this long tail and increasing buying volume right off of 376?
NEUT13|That's a strike price or a mental support level.
NEUT14|So I had that to work with at the opening Bell.
NEUT15|Then we start seeing.
BULL16|Increasing bind volume.
BULL17|I had three and 10 exponential moving average line crossover on my chart, which as I've mentioned in previous videos is a sign of possible bullish things to come.
NEUT18|So I bought calls.
BULL19|We had this pre market high here which I saw as a resistance level.
NEUT20|I wanted to sell to close my calls in a manner that I wasn't needing a pop of this nature 'cause I just wasn't going to get aggressive in this market here and I needed to match this resistance level in order to do so.
NEUT21|Right at all, right?
NEUT22|I'm going to leave my cursor right where it is.
NEUT23|You see how it's right around 377.
BEAR24|That's another strike price.
NEUT25|So I wanted to sell to close right there.
NEUT26|Got in when I had my crossover.
BULL27|An increase in buying volume got out when it was time to sell to close in to strengthen.
BULL28|Glad I did.
NEUT29|Otherwise I might have been part of this wish washy but that was my very quick trade for today.
BULL30|Little bit of a crazy market yes, but hope you're managing risk over staying disciplined.
BULL31|Hope you're staying safe man.
NEUT32|Some wild stories about.
BULL33|Platforms and stuff like that regarding certain stocks which just went haywire lately, so I hope you're staying safe and happy Thursday.
NEUT34|"Ladies and gentlemen."""
