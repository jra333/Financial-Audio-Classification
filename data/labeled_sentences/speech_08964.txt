BEAR8|You might hurt them in the past.
NEUT9|But I'm going to go ahead and just go over very quickly.
NEUT10|The ticker symbol is an MDM OK, and if we Scroll down here we can see that we have a chart that we can analyze on a technical side.
NEUT11|But if you keep continue to Scroll down.
BEAR12|On the CTS on our Q. Ark Invest has been accumulating ibinda stock windows trading under $2.00 alright for quite some time throughout the entire month of August.
NEUT13|Even going into September, and there has been a few occasions where they double double in on your position, so usually around here.
NEUT14|OK, so September 29th, right?
NEUT15|They double their size and over here now.
NEUT16|This is where it got really interesting.
NEUT17|Back in October 23rd.
BULL18|Over the weekend on the 26 they more than tripled their position.

NEUT26|It'll be surprised if they stop buying, but obviously right now they're in there.
BULL27|Very good position.
NEUT28|Obviously we see this nice little uptrend, and if you Scroll down, scroll out to the more indeed long term and or intermediate term, you can see that you know this stuff hasn't really done much, so this could be a Grand Slam in the coming months, weeks, or even.
