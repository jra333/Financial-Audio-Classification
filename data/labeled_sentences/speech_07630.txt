BEAR0|"""Let's talk a little bit about the fact that the markets down almost 800 points this morning."
NEUT1|No concern for you.
BULL2|Well know that's good for us.
NEUT3|Actually, were a net buyer of stocks over time.
NEUT4|And just like being a net buyer of food, I expect to buy food the rest of my life.
NEUT5|And I hope that food goes out and price tomorrow.
BEAR6|So when stocks are down.
NEUT7|We're going to.
NEUT8|We're going to be buying on balance and.
NEUT9|Who wouldn't rather buy, you know, lower price at a higher price.
BEAR10|People are really strange on that.
NEUT11|I'd be the most people most most.
NEUT12|Your listeners are savers, and that means they'll be that buyers and they should want the stock market to go down.
NEUT13|They should want to buy at a lower price than that.
BULL14|"But they got that feeling that they just feel better when stocks are going up."""
