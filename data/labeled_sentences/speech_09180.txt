NEUT0|"""Do we know any more about what the US is actually investigating?"
NEUT1|Yes, this is a significant moment and I would point out that the agency involved in working with the US Justice Department is the Commodity Futures and trading Commission, so this isn't coming from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is already investigating initial coin offerings or Ico's for fraud.
NEUT2|So now you have the two capital markets agencies in the US both investigating these processes, and when it comes to the CFTC justice probe, it looks like.
NEUT3|They're they're really looking at the traditional frauds that we've seen in the stock market.
NEUT4|You're seeing spoofing, you're seeing wash trades.
NEUT5|You're seeing basically all of those manipulative tricks that that stock fraudsters like to do to goose the price and get out.
NEUT6|Of course, at the expense of innocent investors.
NEUT7|That's very interesting.
NEUT8|How much jurisdiction do they have it they have jurisdiction over any transaction that takes place in the US.
NEUT9|And that's a big reason why even exchanges say like.
NEUT10|Many that are here in London and are asking to be regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
BEAR11|"They still will not accept business from anyone in the US because they don't want to tangle with Washington in any way, shape or form."""
