NEUT0|"""Alright, what's up guys?"
NEUT1|Your boy will back in the video today.
NEUT2|We talked about AMC stock.
NEUT3|Ticker symbol AMC an.
NEUT4|I'll give you guys my name's stock analysts and my MC stock predictions on display.
NEUT5|OK so make sure you like the video.
NEUT6|Hit the subscribe and turn post notifications so you don't miss any updates and also make sure when you turn publications that you have the YouTube notifications on your actual phone because I see a lot of you with the notifications on.
NEUT7|Thank you for that but you have to turn the notification on your phone to actually get it.
NEUT8|OK, so let's get into the video.
NEUT9|Big pop up.
NEUT10|Right am see you want to see the big pop down.
NEUT11|We saw it this little bit of goodbye now it's raining sideways so.
BULL12|I do think there is still some room to go on AMC.
NEUT13|I'm not sure this was a level I would have bought off of.
NEUT14|As you can see it didn't come down there during regular hours.
NEUT15|It came down there after hours and I don't trade after hours before market.
NEUT16|I like change in hours but if it came down here on normal hours I would have bought that with maybe over 100 shares 20 shares I would have bought that right there 'cause I saw that as a very good buying opportunity and it did hit it.
NEUT17|Just didn't do it during market which kind of *****.
NEUT18|Now I'm looking for a new entry to get in 'cause this stock is very volatile, so miss you guys are being careful.
BEAR19|But I do think the hedge funds and stuff are trying to bring these stocks down.
NEUT20|Also on game stock I'll make a video on that too.
NEUT21|I think they're trying to bring these down, hold out a shady stuff is going on, and they're trying to do a fake push on silver.
NEUT22|To get everybody out of these stocks and also Robin Hood Limited buys on AMC stock and game stock and other stocks as well.
BEAR23|So I think that is the reason why it is dropping because we can't buy shares like we want to their restricting us on that they're trying to push another one to get more people in that and their overall just trying to bring us down so.
NEUT24|I am looking for entry play to get in on AMC and also in Game Start making video on so after this level will sit aftermarkets it might not be as strong.
NEUT25|So now I'm trying to wait to see where it wants to go.
NEUT26|So if it goes back above $17.00.
NEUT27|You put a line.
NEUT28|So if it goes book about above $17.00 then I'll get short term bullish on that to see price over 20.
NEUT29|But I say if it goes below 11.
BEAR30|It might want to come down below 9.
NEUT31|So what about $11.00 area right in here?
NEUT32|Because it comes out here then I might want to come down to the 9 area and then I don't know what it might do after that.
NEUT33|But I am looking into getting a call.
NEUT34|Mainly shares, but right now we have to wait to see 'cause we don't want to be in a sideways range.
NEUT35|We want to be on the move up, right?
NEUT36|So make sure you guys watch the news.
NEUT37|Hopefully this move is not over and barely just moved one time and then came down.
NEUT38|I think it might have another push up right before it is done, so maybe you guys are careful in this.
NEUT39|Always have risk management and this is how I'm playing the stock either both here.
NEUT40|For me to start buying or in here in this area, I would just wait.
BULL41|OK, I want to see new highs.
NEUT42|I don't want to trade in this range.
NEUT43|I want to start breaking out.
NEUT44|OK, so this is the main level I'm looking for over 17 that's and also looking to get in AMC.
NEUT45|That's how I'm playing it.
BULL46|Hope you guys like this video.
NEUT47|Remember is not recommendation by yourself.
NEUT48|Anything educational, purposes only.
NEUT49|Do not trade anything here in these videos.
NEUT50|"Not catch you guys in the next one."""
