BEAR0|"""Zero in on one big tech stock that we were watching today and that is Amazon shares off just around 2% today."
BULL1|But despite the losses that we're seeing, the stock is actually weather the downturn in the broader markets extremely well over the last couple weeks.
BULL2|Actually hit an all time high last week and for more on this I want to bring in Dan Halley's, joining me now and and when we take a look at the performance that we've seen Amazon Post over the last couple weeks, obviously it has benefited from an.
BULL3|A higher demand for many of its products on E Commerce.
NEUT4|Here there's a lot of big believers out there on the street.
BULL5|Jeffries is one of them and today they raised the price target to $2800 a share.
NEUT6|Yeah, Brett, tell was the one who raised the price target to $2800.
NEUT7|Basically saying that Amazon is a beneficiary of the COVID-19 pandemic.
BEAR8|Basically because of the lockdowns and you know, obviously I'm sure they wouldn't rather have this happening, but as result of people not being able to leave their homes they are ordering more through Amazon more than ever and they're getting the kind of volume that you would normally get around the holiday season.
NEUT9|So when they're thinking here is is that as more people use things like.
NEUT10|Amazon grocery services.
BULL11|Now they may end up continuing to use them in the future even after the lockdowns are lifted, so you could see more people signing up for services that are higher margin than Amazon normally has, and that could greatly benefit them in the long run.
BULL12|Obviously a WS still a huge chunk of the company continuing to do well, seeing a lot more traffic from a lot of users signing up or using different services that work with a WS, so they're seeing a benefit there, but yeah.
NEUT13|And be in front of consumers standpoint.
BULL14|A lot of people still using Amazon to get basic needs, and that's going to truly benefit them in the long run.
BEAR15|It if people stick with the service and then the stock is off, just around 2% today.
BULL16|But hitting that all time high last week, its intraday high of 2461 Dan Hally.
BULL17|Thanks so much for that.
