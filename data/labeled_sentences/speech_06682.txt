BEAR0|"""Hello welcome this technical analysis for April 27th, 2018 and Christina bethany.investmentanalyst@example.com and today will be looking at cold on the daily chart so God had another how bearish around so far this week, falling by one point 3% to 13117.75 today."
BEAR1|But it still continues to trade inside this range bound started at the beginning of January in the short term we might see prices falling further because if we look down here.
BEAR2|Other side has crossed below its neutral threshold of 50 earlier this week and is now heading downwards.
BEAR3|Market is also in bearish area below 0 and it's red trigger line through upside movements are not unlikely there because if you look at the clastics those are currently fluctuating below 20 in oversold area for the first time since December, meaning that once we see the percentage, the Green Percentage K line crossing above the red Percentage teeline gold could change direction.
BEAR4|Could change direction to the upside now looking for support levels so in case the market extends to the downside, the first stop could be at the bottom of this range.
NEUT5|This is between 13109 and 1300, which as you can see is in the half way of this app, like from 12136.34 to 13165.89.
NEUT6|So it should be an important area to watch, given that the 200 day moving average ice also placed here.
BEAR7|However, the market closes significantly below.
NEUT8|All this area breaking this almost five months are range bound.
BULL9|Therefore confirming by the start of a bear market negative momentum could strengthened towards the 61.8% fibo Nachi of 12185.12.
BEAR10|On the other hand, if prices move higher instead resistance could come between the 20 day in the 50 day moving average.
NEUT11|This is between 13130.66 and 13135.38, then further up.
BULL12|Our resistance could also run towards 33156.74, which has been tested several times in the past before the focus shifts to the previous high of 13165.11 and then more than one.
NEUT13|You know how we're high of 13165.89?
NEUT14|Know bout them?
NEUT15|Medium term trading gold has been neutral since the beginning of the year, so as long as the 50 day moving average holds above the 200 day moving average.
NEUT16|The market is more likely to record record an option rather than a downtrend, so that's all for me.
BULL17|"Thank you for watching and have a great day."""
