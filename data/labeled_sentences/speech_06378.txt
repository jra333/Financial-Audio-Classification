NEUT0|"""My father in law always told me the thing that professionals value the least in their life is stacked."
NEUT1|So if you think that you can responsibly outsource this to a little fun, I think 95% of people should be doing it.
NEUT2|I also think that people think of mutual fund in a very limited way, so it's a little equity mutual funds.
NEUT3|They don't realize their range of options that there is out there between mutual funds and ETF's.
NEUT4|Actually you have a very wide range of product options, you know from the most aggressive for the most conservative individual from.
NEUT5|A global staff to voice technology to my name to China, this pretty much everything that you can do on an MF platform today if you want to be a passive investor and for most of us passive investing and not passive in the ETF sense.
NEUT6|Just buying, holding, being quiet and going about the rest of our lives actually was.
NEUT7|I myself am a very passive investors who people kept asking me what did you do in March 2020 with your money and the answer was actually did nothing.
NEUT8|I continued my S IPS, they were happening.
NEUT9|I do S IPS every month because I'm a salaried professional.
NEUT10|And they just happened and most of us that's a perfectly good way to live our lives.
NEUT11|Now it's not fun.
NEUT12|You don't like this and this is the thing I question.
BULL13|I agree.
NEUT14|Trading as coolant reading is fun and I started out as a quant radar myself and perhaps it's on the mutual fund industry to make what we do a little more interesting.
NEUT15|So that's you know we have something to be inspired by, but I don't think investing fundamentally should be exciting.
NEUT16|I mean people go on on pianos on porting, run the other all Jews amazing and Warren Buffett, and most of those guys lead pretty boring, banal lives.
NEUT17|I think Wall Street gives you an impression.
NEUT18|Finance is very high fund and they should constantly be actual and Wolf of Wall Street.
NEUT19|I think money management is arguing basics right?
NEUT20|Didn't you agree?
NEUT21|I agree I haven't like sometimes I wonder, you know, I don't know if I should be saying this on camera but but you know if we're broking company or an entertainment company so.
NEUT22|Trading stocks directly, as if I had to teach someone finance.
NEUT23|I think you know, give a few stocks right.
NEUT24|I get even to buy into some stocks, right?
NEUT25|I mean, I think that's the easiest way to get someone educated on finance.
NEUT26|And India has like this big financial literacy issue.
NEUT27|I think you know people buying a few stalks you know will help in that financial.
NEUT28|You know.
NEUT29|I mean, because you know I have friends who invest in mutual funds.
NEUT30|It's not.
NEUT31|They have no clue what's happening right, as in there is some someone who sold him.
NEUT32|A friend is on an SIP, he doesn't care about anything right, but the same.
NEUT33|You know the another bunch of friends who invest in installs.
NEUT34|They know what's happening in FT, what's happening to the GDP, what is where they're talking about it?
NEUT35|They're talking about it to the families.
NEUT36|So I think we need a lot of that to happen.
NEUT37|'cause we in India the you know the understanding of financial markets, the products.
NEUT38|I mean the literacy.
BEAR39|All of it is is really really low so.
NEUT40|I think I think what what is important though is is when people come to the market, the right expectations, right?
NEUT41|The problem is a lot of folks come in thinking they can make thirty 4050% and then they end up taking too many risks right?
NEUT42|As in so.
NEUT43|Yeah, so as long as you know the heads on the in the right please.
NEUT44|I think direct investing is also you know like a great way to learn about finances.
NEUT45|Investment in securities market or subject market risks.
NEUT46|Read all the related documents carefully before investing.
NEUT47|"Please read the risk disclosure documents carefully before investing in equity shares derivatives mutual fund and or other instruments traded on the stock exchanges."""
