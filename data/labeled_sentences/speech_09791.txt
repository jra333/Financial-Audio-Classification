NEUT0|"""We talked a little bit about Elon Musk and the tweet that he sent yesterday just one word game stock."
NEUT1|There it is with the link to the subreddit, wallstreetbets you on Musk doesn't have the best relationship or history.
NEUT2|I think you could say with the SEC.
NEUT3|Yeah, I'm wondering if.
NEUT4|Is there any potential for this kind of skirting rule skirting regulation?
BEAR5|Can you get in trouble for this?
NEUT6|I don't see it.
NEUT7|I don't see the legal issue.
NEUT8|I mean it would be.
NEUT9|I don't know.
NEUT10|I mean, in theory I guess.
NEUT11|Not with him per say, but you know, if you had someone lying or taking a position and something but look the history of wealthy people talk about a position on TV at ideas.
NEUT12|Dinner is at conferences.
NEUT13|They've done this a long time.
NEUT14|It's not that new, it's just the medium that's different.
NEUT15|But I find more interesting is you have these billionaires are the richest person in the world who wants to be cool like that's kind of the new phenomenon.
NEUT16|Like it's not enough to be the richest person in the world.
NEUT17|He also has to be like on the right side of a Reddit trade.
NEUT18|So it's like when people really want is the social currency or the cachet that comes with being part of the GameStop trade?
NEUT19|Or talking about it?
NEUT20|Or tweeting about it?
NEUT21|Yeah, it sort of is the phenomenon that seems kind of novel.
NEUT22|Yeah, we don't see Jeff Bezos tweeting much or the Waltons for that matter.
NEUT23|Yeah, Warren Buffett's not active until that will be the top.
NEUT24|If he gets on and starts tweeting about how his long GameStop, I will be confident that that's the right there it is.
NEUT25|I want to get your thoughts on AMC before we let you go.
BULL26|Joe AMC stock up.
NEUT27|OK, let's see right here and have it up on the Bloomberg 200.
BULL28|47% that's significantly higher than when I last looked 3 minutes ago.
NEUT29|How are we seeing this sort of phenomenon spread to other stocks, like AMC?
NEUT30|I mean AMC, think about this company, what it's been through over the last 10 months.
NEUT31|Almost had to declare bankruptcy.
NEUT32|Yeah, I mean look, there are some things that this has in common.
NEUT33|I mean, you have this sort of?
NEUT34|Yes, the death of like physical establishments like video game stores or movie theaters.
BEAR35|That's probably oversold, a little bit.
NEUT36|That whole narrative.
NEUT37|Then you have a heavily shorted.
NEUT38|These stocks are heavily shorted, which as I mentioned before that creates the wrong kindling because shorts are potential buyers, every short has to get covered.
NEUT39|At some point you have this small market cap, the low float, and so then you have similar very similar narrative, similar short structure, popular positions to bet against, and so huge potential for sort of like asymmetrical upside.
NEUT40|When the sort of went along, squeeze happens alright.
NEUT41|Bloomberg, Joe, weisenthal Joe.
