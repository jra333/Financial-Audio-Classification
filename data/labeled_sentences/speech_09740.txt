NEUT0|"""Ron, you last week we're starting to talk about what you see as a major change in the, let's say, the context or the backdrop of investing."
NEUT1|And that is how both Fed policy and fiscal policy are now favoring Main Street over Wall Street.
NEUT2|Explain what you mean and what the consequences.
NEUT3|Let me, I'll handle the first part first, 'cause it's easier, but yeah, I do think Tyler that investors going forward are going to have to deal with what I think are profound changes both in fiscal policy, which we began to refer to last week's as a year as a move away from a 40 year trend of trickle down economics to bottoms up budgeting that addresses the needs of Wall Street.
NEUT4|A Main Street over Wall Street.
NEUT5|I think the Fed's policy decision and the Q&A session that Jay Powell engaged in this week when they delivered its decision.
NEUT6|The decision on interest rates.
BULL7|It was equally profound in so far as the Fed has now suggested.
NEUT8|It will not act preemptively, which has been the case for the last 40 years since Paul Volcker, to cut off incipient inflation.
NEUT9|They want to see the data, not a forecast, so that is a wildly different position that both the Federal Reserve is in now and the fiscal policy makers are in.
NEUT10|And I think if we start to see something like a modification of the filibuster or an end to it, policy will get increasingly more progressive from the fiscal side more aggressive from the Federal Reserve side.
NEUT11|And that's something that I think the markets will have to contend with.
NEUT12|It's going to create.
NEUT13|Different types of winners and losers.
NEUT14|I think that part still is to be determined, but I I think that Wall Street needs to really start thinking about what I think is a very important see change both in fiscal and Federal Reserve policy.
NEUT15|So money directly in the hands of individuals at the consumer level as opposed as opposed to tax cuts that trickle down allegedly through the system and #2 less concern about anticipating inflation.
NEUT16|More concerned about actually seeing it.
NEUT17|I'll come back to you an ask.
NEUT18|What kind of stock groups might benefit on either side, but let me turn to Michael for your reaction to that.
BULL19|I know Michael that you believe that right now in the face of a wobbly market here over.
NEUT20|Recent days and weeks, perhaps you say going to cash is foolhardy.
NEUT21|I certainly think it's foolhardy, but I always think that market timing Tyler is is foolhardy.
BEAR22|You know, I think that markets that were already feeling uncertain got kind of a wobbly and uncertain message from Chairman Powell this week.
BULL23|He said, you know, OK, the economy's growing.
NEUT24|We expect inflation, and we're not going to do anything about it.
NEUT25|At the Fed, we intend to let it run hot.
BULL26|And don't you worry Wall Street everything is going to be OK.
NEUT27|I mean, we were used to hearing a plan from the Federal Reserve Chairman saying.
NEUT28|If things get dire, we're going to be there.
NEUT29|We've got a plan to go forward with here.
NEUT30|We're not hearing that.
NEUT31|We're hearing we gotta wait and see and we're going to see what happens here.
NEUT32|We've got $900 billion instead, stimulus at the end of the year.
BULL33|Another one point nine $2.8 trillion in stimulus in a single quarter coming into this market.
NEUT34|I don't know how you sit in cash when you see this much stimulus in a recovery.
NEUT35|The vaccines, everything else share.
BEAR36|Prices are going up.
NEUT37|Can the Fed actually keep on top of this?
NEUT38|Or will they stay at the party too long and and will they kind of lose control of things?
NEUT39|I think that's the fear on Wall Street right now.
NEUT40|We're also at that end of the quarter time where there's not a lot of news and people kind of get a little iffy before you also get to April 15th now, I guess May 15th, but it's an iffy time of the year.
BEAR41|We still need earnings headlines.
NEUT42|Will get him in April.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
