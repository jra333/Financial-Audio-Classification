BEAR0|"""Why David are you so dismissive of this group of investors?"
NEUT1|When we've watched social, media and technology, you know, go into other parts of society and there's no looking back.
NEUT2|I mean, take a look at the impact Facebook's had.
NEUT3|Twitter has had not just on discourse but on politics.
NEUT4|For instance.
NEUT5|Why wouldn't the advent of technology, whether it be from apps like Robin Hood or sites like Reddit, have a lasting impact?
NEUT6|We've seen it time and time again.
NEUT7|Well, look, I think in this specific case look last week was a specific case Melissa where where where you know a hedge fund that was overly leveraged, overly exposed with this short position got exposed.
NEUT8|I'm not so sure.
NEUT9|I think there's a big learning lesson there, so I'm not sure that's you know we're going to be.
NEUT10|You know, seeing lightning strike twice in the same place.
NEUT11|You know, at some point the markets will settle down because if you say Oh well, we got this group of investors.
NEUT12|They're not really fundamentally based investors or they buy anything fundamental.
NEUT13|The next thing they moved to a silver, then there's going to be a lot of people on the other side of that trade.
NEUT14|Realizing that should show silver go up 10 to 20% one day goal didn't move that much, nor the commodity move that much but silver.
NEUT15|So at some point though, people are going to catch on and will quickly bet against these speculative trades.
NEUT16|And you're going to end up getting a wash. And so I think that's what really will.
NEUT17|Is going to come out with this I guess of my Cuban is right is that there's nothing like there's nothing immoral.
NEUT18|There's nothing illegal, you know?
NEUT19|Maybe there's a new entrant into the market and it's this band of color.
NEUT20|Tell investors but but they but they we see they will be they will be squeezed out very quiet.
NEUT21|But the fact that you say hedge funds are going to right size their positions and not become so overly exposed again, that implies that there is an impact, even if it's in how portfolios are managed.
NEUT22|There is a more lasting impact on how we trade collectively than before.
NEUT23|We know that this is a force that can actually make an impact and have ripple effects on the market now.
NEUT24|Well, I guess I look at a little differently in terms of what happened last week with GameStop, which was that he really.
NEUT25|It was a very esoteric specific development.
NEUT26|And maybe you can argue that it's good news insofar as if there's any other hedge funds out there that aren't managing their risk.
NEUT27|OK, as a hedge fund manager, you have to manage your risk everyday, appropriately, and and so somebody discovered anomaly or a whole bunch of people and then left on it through call options.
NEUT28|So you have leverage on top of leverage and it causes these exaggerated moves so that part of it is actually good news in the sense that if I'm running a hedge fund, this is actually a real splash of cold water to make sure that I'm focusing on.
NEUT29|My risk exposure, so that's something different.
NEUT30|You know, these new band of investors that are creating this volatility.
NEUT31|This will get squeezed out because if they're not investing in their resting on on on some fad, or on on some flow.
NEUT32|And it's nothing fundamental, it's going to come out very quickly, sure.
NEUT33|Shepard Smith here.
