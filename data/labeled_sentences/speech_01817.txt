BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|We're going to do some technical analysis for the cryptocurrency cake, which is pancake swap, and I'm just going to kind of give my thoughts on this one.
NEUT2|This is an update from a couple of videos that I've done already, but if you look back to the last video, the level that we wanted to see hold was about 1620 or I had mentioned that you know, potentially like 15 to like 1480 was possible.
BULL3|This would end up at about a low of 1520, so not very far off, but some volumes starting to come in a little bit more on today's candle.
BULL4|This one kind of bounced off of that second level of support, and it's starting to curl us way back up.
BULL5|This chart had a huge move up.
NEUT6|It's still hanging around pretty high, not a crazy retracement.
NEUT7|So this one still has a really, really nice shape to it.
NEUT8|Kind of the support levels remain the same.
NEUT9|Note this one can't close above that like 16 to 1620 range.
BULL10|Again, this one will probably head back to potentially the same support around like 15 ish.
NEUT11|So somewhere in that range is like a pretty strong support at this point, and this is the level I don't want to see lost.
BEAR12|I don't want to see a breaking close below like anywhere from like 15 to 1490 ish.
BEAR13|It's kind of relative doesn't have to be perfect, but somewhere in that range I don't want to see it close below there on the daily at this point.
BULL14|This chart is starting to look pretty good, but I want to see is a little bit more volume start to come in and I want to see this one start to curl back up.
NEUT15|And then again, the levels to watch are the same.
BEAR16|I want to see at this point though, a break in close above 18 battle.
NEUT17|Send this one back up to prior highs about 1910 and then it's going to just be can volume come in and can we send this one up through $20?
NEUT18|And then there's just really not a whole lot of resistance after that, so that's what's really going to set this one up in my opinion alot of the thesis remains the same, so just go ahead and check some of the prior TA videos and you'll see like exactly what I'm talking about.
NEUT19|But yeah, that's.
NEUT20|Pretty much what I'm watching for in the short term, I just want to see this one push back up to those highs and crack them on some volume.
