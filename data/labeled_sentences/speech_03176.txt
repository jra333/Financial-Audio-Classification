BEAR0|"""Was this a hawkish cut then from the Federal Reserve?"
NEUT1|Absolutely, this is about his hakikat as you can get and I think you know, it really suggests that the Fed went a little too far in December but was really interesting to me was how Powell also cushion.
NEUT2|This is by saying, listen, we're getting the economy we expected when we expect to be raising rates, not cutting rates.
NEUT3|So from the feds perspective, that's a pretty big 180 that the economy was needed.
NEUT4|The promise of at least one cut instead of two rate hikes, which is what they thought back in December.
NEUT5|And that's a really big.
BULL6|That's very telling because they needed the promise of a cut.
BULL7|In order to do as well as we have in much the stimulus we've already gotten, but the hesitancy to cut further, I think also the strong signal.
BEAR8|There you saw the dissonance within the Fed that dissents.
NEUT9|That shows that they're not all on board, and they have their own independence, and so I think that's all really important at this stage of the game is that you know, he's marching to his own drum drummer, not the one of the White House, nor the one of the markets, but I think the other important point was how many times did he say he did not know an uncertain time trying to count it up?
BEAR10|"That kind of made me a little uneasy."""
