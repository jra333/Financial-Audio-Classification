NEUT0|"""Hello, today I'm going to talk about my personal view or Singapore property trends in 2021."
NEUT1|So the question would be, is it going up or is it going down?
BEAR2|In my personal opinion, I feel that in 221 the price will go down.
NEUT3|Simply because there will be clean measure by the government on HDB resale.
NEUT4|There will be lesser government land sale which means there will be less and enlarging private property and task.
BULL5|The resale would catch up for private property.
BEAR6|The price will go down not because the actual price drop, but simply because there is lesser transaction.
BULL7|Thanks for watching.
