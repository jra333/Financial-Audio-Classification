NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, this is the investing teacher high school science teacher teaching others about investing this quick video."
NEUT1|I want to go over the Snowflake IPO that will be happening in the future.
NEUT2|Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT3|I don't think Warren Buffett directly, but books are halfway is heavily investing into this company.
NEUT4|We're going to look at some of the solutions that they do to help businesses.
NEUT5|Let's also see if this would be a worthwhile purchase.
NEUT6|IPO's do have a lot of volatility.
NEUT7|Stock price could.
NEUT8|Very quickly up or down so it is more of a riskier move and some other companies just so.
NEUT9|So that's why.
NEUT10|So what is snowflake?
NEUT11|What company and what customers say about it?
NEUT12|Here's a quick clip from their website.
NEUT13|The rumors are true.
NEUT14|That is true, easy to use, it's fast.
NEUT15|It really does what it says and it's cheap.
NEUT16|It's affordable thinking.
NEUT17|It's kind of data warehouses service, you know.
NEUT18|Think of this completely differently.
NEUT19|Not not data warehouse.
NEUT20|A big monolithic, mostly ivory tower.
NEUT21|But now you know both access to billions of data records is something that's seamless for a snowflake came in at a time when we needed not only a solution that worked immediately.
NEUT22|But it did.
NEUT23|I was crazy hard, but then since then it's evolved with us in terms of meeting the needs that have arisen since we started things we couldn't receive how we end the tradition.
BEAR24|So when you look at the revenue of the company they have been increasing their revenue quite a bit, but they also are still losing money currently which is.
NEUT25|Typical for an IPO.
BULL26|So they're going to be one of the leaders in data warehousing.
NEUT27|Let's help companies generate vast amounts of information.
NEUT28|Another Ave for Snowflake will be mobile gaming companies.
NEUT29|They slice and dice of trillions of interactions of their users to learn other advancement for free.
NEUT30|When they ask for in app purchases, all these things could be helpful for gaming companies so we can track activity on the networks and then apply artificial intelligence to identify Rd logins and hacking attacks so it could be used for data security as well.
BULL31|Now the revenue did jump quite a bit 174%.
BULL32|That's one $65 million and the fastest growing.
NEUT33|This application of 2019.
BULL34|The customers are increasing their spending as well.
BULL35|Again, they're not profitable yet, but their revenues are increasing quite a bit.
NEUT36|We're looking at about a $30 billion valuation.
NEUT37|Last week, the company announced we're going to raise 3 billion for itself, an IPO burkshire halfway and essentially his data analysis will do 250 million in the company at the same time, which is pretty rare for Warren Buffett uses and about some IPOs simply go more established companies.
NEUT38|So the stock will be available tomorrow.
NEUT39|I'm posting this on 9:15.
NEUT40|Will be available on 916.
NEUT41|It's going to prices deal one point later today.
NEUT42|And big data, big data and big data with Snowflake IPO because Warren Buffett is one of the investors.
BULL43|It does help social credibility with the marketing and CEO of the company as well.
NEUT44|So again, it is something that you might want to consider buying if you want it.
NEUT45|Pretty high risk.
BEAR46|Obviously IPO's could be very volatile.
NEUT47|Might go up or down but at a $30 billion valuation.
BULL48|Seems pretty reasonable for the revenues that are increasing.
NEUT49|"Get on the bus and teacher if you have any general questions or no in the comments down below like subscribe all that good stuff and I'll see you guys next."""
