NEUT0|"""It's Groundhog Day, and although we are forecast to have six more weeks of winter, the outlook for precious metals doesn't seem so cold."
NEUT1|At least that's what our next guest says today.
NEUT2|Joining us in studio is Mike Mcglone of Bloomberg Intelligence.
BULL3|Might good to have you back in studio?
NEUT4|How do you like my open?
NEUT5|I like it.
BEAR6|It's good to be back in when I think of cold weather, thinking, natural gas and natural gas has been down.
NEUT7|'cause of weather it's been mild, but not much of a factor for gold, right?
NEUT8|So let's talk about gold.
BEAR9|I think you come bearing good news today isn't getting what I now call a Trump bump here.
NEUT10|I think that's more than that.
BEAR11|I look at gold as I want to look at the end of the year and wouldn't mind seen seeing gold down because the stock market is doing better than the dollars doing great and there hasn't been a lot of volatility from Trump and the way I see most trends, it's going the other way.
BEAR12|The stock market is very much extend.
BULL13|We all know it's very much overdue for a correction.
NEUT14|You can see that in low volatility it's can only stay low for so long.
BULL15|The dollars been taking, it's coming back a little bit this year, but for less 234 years, it's a very extended.
BEAR16|And Trump do we think things are going to change from him so gold is may be running into a bit of a perfect storm perfect storm.
BEAR17|And if we look at the VIX which is basically Wall Street set measure of volatility, you know it's at 2 year lows here.
NEUT18|But you think this can paint a good scenario for gold?
NEUT19|Yes, one thing you see in the chart is the VIX, but VIX overlaid the key.
NEUT20|The key thing is the 26 week moving average estimate measured over time each day as we see in gold today will make you lose your hair, but how low it said?
BEAR21|The lowest levels been in two years.
BEAR22|It's just unsustainably low based on history.
BULL23|And generally it will revert higher from here.
BULL24|So if the VIX goes higher, we generally know that means higher volatility.
BULL25|Generally lower stocks is generally good for gold, and that's kind of what I think the gold markets looking forward to 'cause you can see in the chart, gold started to pick up the VIX, still is still very low, but we're just seeing a few signs of some volatility coming back into the stock market.
BEAR26|Just has to break out because it's been low so long.
NEUT27|Well, that's the thing about volatility can stay low for a long time, but just based on history it doesn't stay this low that long and hasn't.
BEAR28|And the last time it did get near certain levels, it was near a pretty significant low involved in the market.
BULL29|Volatility recovered so basketball team number.
NEUT30|One thing to remember is always mean reverting.
NEUT31|At some point it's going to mean revert higher.
NEUT32|It's a question of time.
NEUT33|Well, we've seen a lot of fund managers just take a contrarian bet on gold.
NEUT34|Just based on that VIX chart.
NEUT35|So let's talk about another metal.
NEUT36|You're liking platinum, what's in what's in its future?
NEUT37|Well, the thing I so much not so much like, but just have to really acknowledge about platinum.
NEUT38|It's basically.
BEAR39|Underpriced to virtually every other asset out there.
NEUT40|Note most notably, first of all its main nemesis or adversary Playdium.
NEUT41|It's cheap to play him, it's cheap to gold, it's cheap to copper.
NEUT42|It's cheap to silver, maybe cheaper relative, relatively valued over a long term historical basis is very low, and the number one source of demand for platinum isn't really auto catalyst.
NEUT43|That's a key source of demand, but it's jewelry Ann.
NEUT44|I just look at relative value, it's just very attractive, so the things will come about, you know, supply and demand, and generally happen to make the market, but generally.
NEUT45|It just looks too attractive relative to other assets, most notably the other metal and you mentioned Palladium.
NEUT46|You saw the boy got last week, right?
BEAR47|You know taking its sharpest dip in over 10 years.
NEUT48|Any thoughts on that Palladium here.
BEAR49|Play Team is still very strong and attractive, but that's the problem.
NEUT50|Everybody knows it.
NEUT51|It has been and I can't show you a very attractive relative value to other metals that I can show you in platinum thing that platinum has going for.
NEUT52|It is.
NEUT53|It's a more efficient catalyst and played him can only get so low to platinum.
NEUT54|Some point there's going to be thrifting.
NEUT55|Back to platinum.
NEUT56|All right?
BULL57|Well, thank you for joining us Mike always good thoughts from you.
BULL58|Thanks for having me and thanks for watching this edition of Kikos goal report.
NEUT59|Stay tuned.
BULL60|"We'll have much more for you."""
