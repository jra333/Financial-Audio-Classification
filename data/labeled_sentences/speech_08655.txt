NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol AAPL Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link also from the US disclosure standpoint, I do own Apple from the long side in my retirement portfolio, so just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis.
BEAR4|Well, the bloodshed continues here on Apple a totally bearish day and not only day but overall really weak for the most part.
NEUT5|So updates can be done.
NEUT6|First thing to do is just a little house cleaning, get rid of outline there.
BULL7|Yeah that levels.
NEUT8|You know, served its purpose for now.
NEUT9|And yeah, it's still pertains to the charge is not relevant, and from a presentation standpoint I don't trust causing clutter and confusion, 'cause there's lines every.
NEUT10|Let's try to keep this as clean as possible.
NEUT11|The first big update that needs to be done comes about based on a foundational role in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below, they tend to act as resistance and that's what happened with 109 as I pointed out in the previous video, I did, 109 had done a fantastic job of wholeness support, I mean, stubborn, stubborn, stubborn.
NEUT12|But then this morning the price just was not.
BEAR13|The Bulls weren't strong enough, they ran out of strength.
NEUT14|And the Bears you can see right there.
NEUT15|Once that was broken, really opened up the floodgates of momentum to the downside and then down it went from there.
NEUT16|So point here being if there's any sort of attempted consolidation and then attempted move to the upside.
NEUT17|109 is now going to be the first key battleground that you're going to want to watch from the resistant side of things.
NEUT18|Also, just keep in the back your mind.
NEUT19|You have the 50.
NEUT20|Moving average up there.
NEUT21|You know that purple line currently valued right around 1:11.
NEUT22|Eighty but you know, definitely before we get too far ahead of yourself, the first for the price.
NEUT23|First just needs a break above the 109 mark.
NEUT24|In terms of levels of support.
NEUT25|Nothing fancy here at all, just the questionable word of the bleeding finally stopped today and the bleeding finally stopped down there at the 106 mark.
NEUT26|So 106 at first key level.
BEAR27|If that level can not quite hold up, then as you're seeing here, it's getting hard to see.
NEUT28|But that's just really goes to show that it's been quite awhile since the price have been down this low, but if 106 cannot quite hold up then I mean it opens up into another pretty big space on the chart with the next level of support not being until down around the 103 mark, so those would be the main levels of what's going forward.
BULL29|But overall yeah, the bears are eaten quite a bit of apples this week.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT31|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT32|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL33|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT34|The first key is super weird.
NEUT35|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT36|But in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT40|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
