BEAR0|"""Yeah, stop working."
NEUT1|Actually try to bottom today.
NEUT2|But it failed the first time around.
BEAR3|We were dragged down by the more powerful bond market for a late day bouse, erased a big chunk of those losses, now only sinking 357.7 be falling .82%.
BULL4|But more importantly, NASDAQ actually managed to advance a basis point.
BULL5|Stunning comeback, but let's not get too carried away.
BEAR6|It was still the worst week for the averages since the financial crisis not understand the bond market is bigger than the stock market.
NEUT7|We don't talk about it because it's boring, but it is very important to the direction of your portfolio.
NEUT8|Everything is wrapped up in bond yields always has been learned that they were not 40 years ago.
NEUT9|There are multi billion dollar programs right now that sell stocks.
NEUT10|Whenever those yields go down, it's formulaic and they buy buy stocks whenever the yields go up and today those yields went down.
NEUT11|Hard.
BEAR12|Benchmark 10 year Treasury got as low as 1.12% late today.
NEUT13|We're closing it just one point 16C.
BEAR14|That's a record low level signaling that economy is growing weaker and there's a real flight to quality as investors hide their money in fixed income coronavirus supply chain.
BEAR15|In other words, the bond market screaming at the Corona virus is far more far worse.
NEUT16|Than most people realize global Commerce will take a real hit, and it might even be something similar to 2008 when all hell broke loose.
NEUT17|Now I can't tell you whether the bomb markets right.
NEUT18|I'm not an epidemiologist, but I know the market, so let me give you the game plan for next week.
NEUT19|Given how this outbreak is played out, it's very likely that they'll be more cases.
BEAR20|Come Monday, it'll be a lot of bad news.
NEUT21|It'll be the headlines.
NEUT22|I know that.
NEUT23|Doesn't matter may not affect the stock market as much as you think, but you know what could affect the bond yields.
NEUT24|We gotta watch.
BEAR25|If that's the case, the stock market will indeed get dragged down again on Monday.
BULL26|However, that could finally set us up for snapback.
NEUT27|Rally on Super Tuesday.
BULL28|If Joe Biden like by the stock market, those better than expected to 15 primaries and caucuses that happened that day, it's looking like Biden could run away with the South Carolina primary tomorrow and it may give him a little more man.
NEUT29|He needs to turn things around on Super Tuesday, but remember as far as Wall Street's concern, anything that keeps Bernie Sanders away from the nomination is good news.
NEUT30|And no, Wall Street does not feel that if Sanders gets it's a shoe in for Trump, they just feel like you're Sanders gets.
NEUT31|It's dangerous.
NEUT32|OK, so if we get an all encompassing down day on Monday with more.
BEAR33|Coronavirus clusters, more sick people may be a world leader or celebrity getting sick that might get us to the point where the markets totally oversold even more than it is now.
NEUT34|Now we create some buying opportunities that are a little more lasting if you don't have any cash on the sidelines, stay tuned.
NEUT35|I'll tell you exactly what.
BULL36|Still we're selling, and there are typically after today's bounce at some levels to raise capital.
