BEAR0|"""Now some people will say that's all."
NEUT1|This is a bubble created by the multi trillion dollar stimulus package, and the Federals are printing money like crazy.
NEUT2|I say forget it, that doesn't work.
NEUT3|Don't asteris stuff, and then it doesn't help you Congress and the Fed were doing what I call their jobs.
NEUT4|They created conditions where some companies can thrive, but the companies that are truly thriving are the ones that worked for Apple.
NEUT5|Microsoft, Amazon Alphabet didn't get trillion dollar plus valuations.
BEAR6|2 trillion today in the case of Apple because of the Fed.
NEUT7|And honestly, even after these moves I can.
NEUT8|I can create a story which says that those stocks aren't that expensive.
NEUT9|Of course, the other thing about the recent rally is what I mentioned last night.
NEUT10|It is heavily weighted in favor of the tech stocks that Wall Street loves.
NEUT11|When the economy stagnant.
NEUT12|Five tech companies now make up 25% of his Buford.
NEUT13|That's hardly diversified.
BULL14|The strength and housing is very encouraging.
NEUT15|The strength and tech, not so much.
BEAR16|The most worrisome thing about this market, though it's the continued weakness in the financials.
NEUT17|They can't get out of their own way.
BEAR18|They are so far away from their highs.
BEAR19|It's incredible now I would feel a heck of a lot better about the economy if the big banks were going up and the financial technology stocks were going down.
BEAR20|I think the weakness in the banks is far more important than Apple hitting $2 trillion today or the home builders rally, or even commodities going higher because it's about credit risk in credit risk and really hurt the stock market.
NEUT21|So let's put it all together.
NEUT22|Is the market predicting boom?
NEUT23|It's possible.
NEUT24|But there's one huge caveat.
NEUT25|Whether we're talking about home buying or consumer spending, everything comes back to COVID-19.
BULL26|I'm going to get some positive.
BULL27|See if you believe for generations, new cocktail trial in partnership with Roche that was talked about this morning can cut down the death rate to much lower levels.
NEUT28|If you believe that everyone will be vaccinated in six months 'cause so many good companies are working on vaccines.
BEAR29|If you think Congress will pass a second stimulus package to bail out the millions of people who've lost their jobs, not to mention all the smart small businesses in danger of going under until we get the vaccine, then yeah.
NEUT30|We could be in for a bull an it could be in great shape that it being the economy by next February me.
BEAR31|I think it's a little more complicated that as I see it, the pandemic is causing permanent changes in the economy and if those changes aren't rolled back you might not like where we're headed.
NEUT32|Let me put it this way.
NEUT33|If small business didn't exist of all we had were Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Target, Home Depot, and Lowe's.
NEUT34|They were the only retailers that mattered if we didn't have a huge travel, an leisure and dining industry all supported by small business that I would feel great about the future right now.
NEUT35|But you see, small business is integral to our economic future, and right now that's what's being eroded, if not being wiped out.
BEAR36|That makes it a lot harder for me to be as optimistic as I'd like, because sooner later that pain will make its way into the market, most likely via the banks, which is what those stocks are telling about, which is why they're doing so poorly.
BULL37|The bottom line, yes, I think the economy is going to look better six months from now, but basically action in the market is probably not going to be that great.
BULL38|I'll start believing in a V shaped economic recovery the moment we get a V shape recovery in the bank stocks, but not before.
NEUT39|Until then, the real boom will only come with a vaccine.
