BULL0|"""Welcome traitor tickmill charts with me."
NEUT1|Patrick mainly I want to draw your attention to developing opportunities in the euro dollar on the four hour time frame here.
NEUT2|Still under pressure the year at the moment we have seen some corrective price action here, but the overlapping nature suggests that this is corrective and whilst we hold one 1820 which is the equality objective, an ABC equality objective.
BEAR3|Look for a loss of the daily pivot through one.
NEUT4|1788.
BULL5|Two encouraged, bearish exposure, ultimately looking for a move to test the quality objective versus this swing.
BEAR6|Now down to one fifteen 87116 will also be a pivotal area for repairs to test.
NEUT7|As always, traders plan the trade trade, the plan most importantly manage your risk until next time.
BULL8|"Thanks very much."""
