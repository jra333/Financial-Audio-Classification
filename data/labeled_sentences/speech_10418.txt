NEUT1|Jim.
NEUT2|We just talked to Stacy Cummingham about some of the big bumps we've seen in these IPO's that are coming out and you're trying to look out for the people who have been investors in this.
NEUT3|Your point on many of these things is if you make that much money that quickly it might be time to kind of rein it back in.
BEAR4|Yeah look, I mean, I don't want to say that the market is broken, but the process of how we're doing these deals is definitely broken.
BEAR5|This is what happened in 1999 where the syndicate desk completely misjudged.
NEUT6|The public and the public is back, and so their pricing deals as if the public isn't back and it's just the same old same old funds buying stock.
NEUT7|And because they're getting it wrong, they have a lot of allocations.
BEAR8|Wrong, they have the people maybe being way too aggressive with the snowflake, so therefore air BNB will have another wave in the city for door dash.
NEUT9|Another way, that's how people think, and it may be.
NEUT10|These stocks should have been where they were to begin with, and I think that the syndicate people should go back and find people who ran deaths in 1999.
NEUT11|They can tell you what went wrong, but this whole notion of this new cohort and it's just not just Robin, but it's it's the public has not been factored in, so everybody keeps blowing it.
NEUT12|You look Brian Chesky is not in charge.
NEUT13|Brian Chesky's done one DS one for one.
NEUT14|The people at the syndicate test.
NEUT15|They have to do more homework.
NEUT16|They have to learn that kind of embarrassing.
NEUT17|I think Stacy is going to deal with direct listing, but the fact is is that I would love to see the sending people come on our show and say how stupid it really.
NEUT18|An understand explain.
NEUT19|How they didn't know.
NEUT20|Again, just like they didn't know in 99 their hapless, they caused a lot of problems or big lawsuits when it was done, they ought to start focusing on how to do it better.
NEUT21|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT22|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
