NEUT1|Death Star CEO Darth Bezos strikes again.
BEAR2|Amazon's E Pharmacy dropped this week, offering prime members free two day shipping and savings on prescription meds.
NEUT3|Amazon has over 110,000,000 U prime members.
BEAR4|That's a major code red to the OG pharmacies, which sell hundreds of billions of dollars in prescription meds.

BEAR6|Amazon's steep discounts threaten its entire value proposition.
NEUT7|It's one of the more reasons to buy Amazon if you didn't already have enough reasons to buy Amazon.
NEUT8|On the other hand.
NEUT9|I would steer clear of the legacy pharmacy companies because right now it is a battleground.
NEUT10|"Until next time my name is Jordan Knight and this has been Investor Mania."""
