NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the."
NEUT1|S&P 500 and as you can see the S&P 500 has.
NEUT2|Continued to just kind of hang around 3200 now I think ultimately we're going to have to try to go to the high as I think everybody is aiming for that.
NEUT3|There's no real fundamental reason for prices being this high, but you can see that clearly hasn't mattered so.
NEUT4|3100 is the initial pull bank.
BULL5|3000 is even better.
NEUT6|I don't know if we'll get it, but.
NEUT7|That's what I'd like to see 200 day Ma could come into play.
BULL8|Ultimately, I think we are going to go to the highs.
NEUT9|This is all about liquidity.
NEUT10|It's got zero, zilch, nada, todo.
NEUT11|With anything actually economically related, yes.
BULL12|The economies around the world are opening up, but.
NEUT13|They're not going to be as vibrant and strong as they were up here, so from a valuation metric it makes no sense.
BEAR14|But people you know it's over exuberant, the market got oversold.
NEUT15|Now it's going to be overbought, so and unfortunately I think this is what you're going to see a lot of.
NEUT16|"Let's do these wild swings, so be prepared for that."""
