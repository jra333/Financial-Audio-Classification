NEUT13|This is video 2 of 19 for the upgraded stock series to watch from the beginning click on the link in the description.
BULL14|And thanks for watching.
NEUT15|Viva Viva first of all and pull up my info here.
NEUT16|We've gotta buy target at 2:40.
NEUT17|So right here we've got a support 240 by target anywhere between 2:40 and 2:50, so anywhere in here we've got an analyst price target of 250.
NEUT18|Wait, is that right?
NEUT19|Yeah.
BEAR20|That's kind of weird.
NEUT21|Anna Yahoo product Price Target 327 holy moly.
BEAR22|This is recently upgraded too, so I gotta believe maybe their numbers are wrong.
NEUT23|Sometimes that happens.
NEUT24|They could possibly mean 350.
BEAR25|I've seen that happen quite a lot where somebody just missed types of numbers.
NEUT26|They do a lot of stuff so we'll keep this 327 in mine financials.
NEUT27|They are making money earnings per share.
NEUT28|$2.36 per share with a PE ratio of 113.
NEUT29|We like to see that Viva Systems.
NEUT30|It's an American cloud computing company focused on pharmaceutical life Sciences industry applications.
NEUT31|While the historical earnings per share growth rate for Viva is 45 and a half percent, investors should actually focus on the projected growth.
BULL32|The company's earnings per share is expected to grow about 10% this year, crushing the industry average which calls for earnest EPS growth of about 8% pretty big deal.
NEUT33|We got looking at the chart long term.
BULL34|Beautiful upward trend.
BEAR35|We see they just like most, got hit by the most recent correction.
NEUT36|Taking a look just a little closer.
NEUT37|Here I put this support in at about 2:40 I see a by 2:40 to 2:50 and I actually see a price target myself, right about $300 a share.
NEUT38|So you know you're looking at about 50 points on a $250.
NEUT39|Stock was about 20% on your money.
NEUT40|I like it.
NEUT41|I like it a lot.
BULL42|So thanks for watching.
NEUT43|"And we'll see on the next one."""
