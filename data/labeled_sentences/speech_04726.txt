BEAR0|"""Major brands are now publicly distancing themselves from NFL quarterback Deshaun Watson after allegations of ****** misconduct."
BEAR1|Today, Nike suspended its endorsement deal with the quarterback.
NEUT2|In a statement.
BEAR3|The company said it is deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and that it will closely monitor the situation hours later.
BEAR4|The headphones company Beats by Dre terminated its partnership with Deshaun Watson, 22.
BEAR5|Women are suing the quarterback for alleged ****** misconduct.
NEUT6|One of them spoke publicly yesterday and for the first time, Ashley so lease is as massage therapist.
BEAR7|She says Deshaun Watson exposed himself and touched her inappropriately last year during a session at her home.
BEAR8|Watson has denied all of the allegations against him.
BEAR9|His lawyer says the lawsuits were brought after the quarterback refused what he called baseless settlement demands.
NEUT10|CNBC Sports business Reporter Jabari Young, now Jabari Deshaun Watson's stands to lose.
NEUT11|A lot of money here.
NEUT12|Even a Chevy as he does you know, you know, listen, it may not be a lot of money for top tier athletes, but you know, according to Forbes, you know back in September 2020 he made about 8,000,000 in endorsements last season, last year in 2020 alone.
NEUT13|So you have to figure that that was going to line up again for 2021 and not even a mention that you know he still has an extension that's going to kick in in 2022 seasons.
NEUT14|So depending on his status he may miss out on that type of money as well, not even to mention, hey, does he even play in the 2021 season?
NEUT15|Should these allegations follow him into the.
BEAR16|Year, so he's definitely, you know, on target of losing a substantial amount of money, but again, just allegations and you got to see how it plays out, but certainly not looking good for him right now.
NEUT17|Yeah, he has denied them to Bury in your article today.
NEUT18|You compared Watson situation to two NFL greats, Big Ben Roethlisberger and Michael Vick.
BEAR19|Both players face legal troubles, but their sponsors reacted very differently.
NEUT20|Does race play a factor?
NEUT21|You know which ever I think you have to ask the question.
NEUT22|Will waste race play a factor in this particular situation and you go back in 2009 and 10 when Ben Rothenberger again, he was not charged in any of these allegations, but you know sponsors did stick with him.
NEUT23|Nikes, ****** Sporting Goods, they stuck with him.
NEUT24|I was looking at an article that we wrote on CNBC years ago about how ***** was going to stick with him throughout and how Nike was going to let the legal system play out.
NEUT25|Does that happen for Deshaun Watson as well?
BEAR26|You know Nike suspended their relationship not terminated like Beats by Dre.
NEUT27|But do it does that play out the same way?
NEUT28|Because again, even though he's facing more allegations, you know it doesn't matter 1/2/10.
NEUT29|Any type of allegation that involves ****** misconduct.
NEUT30|****** assault is serious and you know you obviously brands don't want to be put in no spotlight, but will they let the process play out and give him the due diligence and time will tell.
NEUT31|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT32|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
