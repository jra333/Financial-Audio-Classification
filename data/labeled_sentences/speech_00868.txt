NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to this new supply demand and stock analysis for total ticker TOT."
NEUT1|This is the tracking disclaimer.
NEUT2|You can post a video and read it at any time.
NEUT3|OK, let's take a look at the tile.
NEUT4|So this is an oil really company.
NEUT5|This is the monthly chart.
NEUT6|This is not a short term.
NEUT7|Analysis is a longer term analysis.
NEUT8|We are pointing out here near supply here, here and there.
NEUT9|Still in plain out nicely then down one press try to reach that area.
NEUT10|Didn't retrace to it.
NEUT11|And now there's another area of supply over there.
NEUT12|So there's a clear show bias with GNU area supply being created.
NEUT13|The market context to structure the directional bias right now.
BEAR14|Is short very about price action over there and light crude oil Brent crude oil futures are dropping like a rock, creating also sneer supply totale is a company that is all related to the oil industry, so it is being rocked by the witness of light crude oil and Brent crude oil.
NEUT15|So it doesn't really matter what happens on the old pair.
NEUT16|With Russia, Norway, the US, Saudi Arabia, what they're doing with.
NEUT17|It is clear that the dirt decisions which, like I said, you don't need to know what they're doing.
BEAR18|Are there decisions are creating new strong imbalances in the clear bearish bias?
NEUT19|So that's only reason.
NEUT20|I mean, it's only a place or a type of thread to be placed in this kind of scenario, that is to go shoot you can use any kind of option strategy to place short spreads along ports.
NEUT21|Long term I mean there are many many strategies to trade stocks stock market.
NEUT22|You have to know how to drive them, but what I'm trying to point out here is that there is a clear show bias with New Years supply and it looks like pricing not going to retrace to these imbalances, but it does and it couldn't will either.
NEUT23|Retrace with that area supply we don't know but it is.
BULL24|Undoubtedly a very strong area of supply in the mean time you will be able to trade.
NEUT25|Sorry to trade small small imbalances or small time frames using other strategies.
NEUT26|You could even use indicators.
NEUT27|It doesn't really matter if that works for you.
NEUT28|We don't need them for supply demand, so having the show bias it would be great that if you decide to trade total, which is an old related company, you should take short instead of long because the bigger picture context.
BEAR29|Structure and bias is bearish.
NEUT30|Remember that then that this is just a single time frame analysis and it is not enough to make a transition decision and these analysis is not a signal service.
NEUT31|You must know when and when not to place a trade based on different implant and only only after putting the analysis into context by doing a multiple time frame analysis.
NEUT32|But these kind of analysis using supplying medicine but the money amounts that should help you.
NEUT33|Place a directional bias on these particular stock, which is bearish.
NEUT34|"Enjoy the rest of the day and be happy bye bye."""
