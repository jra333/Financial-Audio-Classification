BULL0|"""Welcome back is 18th of August 2020, Tuesday, the 2nd day of the week we are at #17 OK. Be OK, be OK."
NEUT1|He's native exchange token for X so far.
NEUT2|OK against BTC here we notice this some time ago.
NEUT3|There was a descending triangle coming in for OK. Be against BCN.
BULL4|OK yesterday started collapsing through the descending triangle and we've also collapsed through the skinny pink line and we fully acquired tool fresh targets out of the oven.
NEUT5|One is at 45,000, the other one is at 32,000.
NEUT6|If we reach target monitor going number one is not too far away, is only about 6% away, but target is about 33 freaking percent away.
BEAR7|So there is a danger that OK, we might drop 33 freaking percent.
BEAR8|Yes Sir, right now at this point of time things are not looking good because it really touched this.
NEUT9|Keep in mind usually when you touch the skinny pink line more often than not you will be breaking through.
NEUT10|Sure, there may be a rally and you may may postpone the brick.
NEUT11|But eventually you will be breaking through.
BEAR12|We might form an even bigger descending triangle, and we could be dropping much lower for OKB against BTC.
NEUT13|The danger is there, but.
NEUT14|You have to be very, very careful because for OK Now we've been rising without properly correcting right?
NEUT15|So now we are in a proper correction.
NEUT16|Are we going to target #2?
NEUT17|I don't know where we touch target number one.
NEUT18|Very likely we should be talked touching target number one.
NEUT19|Of course you treating this always know.
NEUT20|I mean, there's no guarantees that things will hit our targets, but potentially we could target number one and then we could be forming some sort of a falling channel as well.
NEUT21|And usually following channels break towards the upside.
NEUT22|So OK, we could actually be breaking up, so this could actually be a move.
NEUT23|For a small correction before we go powerful, OK, be against BTC towards the upside and we could miss out on target #2 this good absolute freaking lutely happen, so you'll be very careful about putting on shorts.
NEUT24|OK, be at this point of time, alright?
NEUT25|So let's move on to OK be against USD T. But before that please give this video like if enjoyed it.
NEUT26|Subscribe to the channel and let me know what you think will be in the comments below.
BEAR27|So forgive me against you know we have two targets towards the upside who are still bullish for OK be against USD but we are bearish.
BULL28|4K B against BTC.
BULL29|We're both bullish and bearish at the same time, so for OK against USD T we have targets at $6.85, respecting more upside to come if we hit target, there will be another 16% towards the upside.
NEUT30|So there you go, respecting websites.
NEUT31|I don't know if you're going to be hitting our targets here at $11.00 and $9.10, but definitely we have a target for 685 and we're expecting to touch 685, so yeah.
BULL32|Twisty bias bullish for OK be against USD T alright.
NEUT33|So yeah I guess from my local technical analysis.
BULL34|Thank you very much for watching.
BULL35|I hope you enjoyed it.
NEUT36|"I'll see you in the next few days."""
