BULL0|"""OK guys, I just want to jump into the charts real quick."
NEUT1|Welcome to pocket change of if it's your first time here.
NEUT2|My name is Anthony and I'm going over the chart agency agency investments.
BULL3|Now I do own some of these shares an I hope that they do good in the long run on Robinhood.
NEUT4|Right now they have a 69% by with over 20,000 people investing into this stock is going for $12.38 now.
NEUT5|The reason why I like this stock also could check this out.
NEUT6|It does have an 11.31 dividend yield, so for me I am a dividend investor and I like the state to the stock and hold it for a bit and this is a stock that I like and they've been doing pretty well.
NEUT7|To see.
BEAR8|I'm up 2.41%, so they've kind of been trading sideways for a while now.
BULL9|I don't have too many shares, but I'm definitely hoping this one comes back up to $19.00 and in the meantime I'm going to take hold of those dividend dividends and I will be adding more.
BEAR10|You know, just be careful out there because a lot of stocks are losing their dividends real fast, as as I know now, agency is still going with their dividend, but you know that could change by tomorrow.
NEUT11|But let's go ahead and jump into.
NEUT12|We will real quick.
NEUT13|So I want to jump into Waibel ANSI agency.
NEUT14|Now I'm looking I'm going to pull back now.
NEUT15|If you guys are looking into a trading platform like we will, I do have a link in the description, but when we both fell on March 18th, it hit a low of 625 and since then it's been going up and down at a high of 14 and came back to 8 back to 13.
NEUT16|So now we are sitting at $12.38.
NEUT17|And we were sitting right at the resistance line of.
NEUT18|The anime moving average 120.
NEUT19|Anet is pushing below this 120 right now and we're going to see if they can pop back up now.
BULL20|I do believe it will pop back up.
NEUT21|I'm very bullish and I don't see why it would go underneath it right now with all the good news that's been happening, we haven't really.
NEUT22|Heard of any situations?
BULL23|So there's a good chance this will keep going up.
NEUT24|And let me go ahead and jump into here because the reason why I looked into this was right here.
NEUT25|It's looking like we got some insider trading.
NEUT26|We have Kane, Gary D Kengeri deep by 202 million shares.
NEUT27|Looks like he is the CEO CIO.
NEUT28|So he bought 2,000,000 shares at 2,000,000 worth of shares.
NEUT29|It came out to be a hundred 892 dollars, 892 shares.
NEUT30|The value was 2,000,000.
NEUT31|He bought these at 1260.
NEUT32|So.
NEUT33|That was on the 6th, so the insiders have been buying Kane.
NEUT34|Gary D has been buying up alive share so I just want to take a look at that and show you guys a little bit on the inside of what's going on with agency.
NEUT35|Like I said, I own this stock.
BULL36|"I hope it does good and good luck with your guys is trading."""
