BULL0|"""Well, well, the NFL announcing New 11 year media distribution deals with all of its media partners."
NEUT1|The NFL won't comment on the value of these deals, but sources tell me that this collective deal is worth more than $100 billion over the next 11 years to the NFL with its media partners paying on average about double what they paid before.
NEUT2|With the exception of ESPN, which I'm told will pay about a third more than it was paying it before and in a big move for streaming, Amazon is acquiring exclusive rights.
NEUT3|To Thursday night games.
NEUT4|For about a billion dollars, that's according to a source.
NEUT5|So you will have to be an Amazon Prime member to watch those games if you are out of market.
BULL6|The NFL is also expanding digital rights across the board, so ESPN, plus Peacock, Paramount Plus and others will have the ability to simultaneously stream games when they air on their networks.
NEUT7|And ABC has also acquired the rights to televise it two Super Bowl games in this next cycle.
NEUT8|I spoke to the NFL's chief media and business Officer, Brian Rolapp.
NEUT9|He tells me these deals have much broader reach.
BULL10|And that they'll have flexibility around scheduling to bring the best games into primetime windows and that the NFL's partners will have more ability to innovate around those digitally streamed games and make them more interactive guys back over to you.
