NEUT0|"""We have current open positions in Neo would not hurt to add more if you need 2 mag mag is about to turn green in the arrow size right above 50."
NEUT1|I mean this is a really perfect setup.
BULL2|I wouldn't even more confident I will get more confidence if it closes above that 50 mark but the next week or so will be really big for NEO, specially with the unveiling of the new vehicle coming out late next week.
NEUT3|So we have some explorations at the end of the month.
NEUT4|And we may be adding on or buying some other ones at the 15th or the other 20.
NEUT5|The other data is, so be on the lookout for Neo.
BULL6|"We're expecting a move up to the high of 57, so that gives us a pretty good run up with an expected move about 30 to 40% in our options work only were already recognizing about 35% right now."""
