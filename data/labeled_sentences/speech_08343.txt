NEUT23|So let's get back into our video.
NEUT24|So today we're going to be talking about Workhorse and then see today it reached $28.00 and it is absolutely crazy how fast this stock has been growing, specially back in May.
NEUT25|Yes can see that at the end of June.
BULL26|At the beginning of July we saw just increase rapidly and then having small pullbacks here and there but finally going back up.
NEUT27|So clear.
NEUT28|Right now it's at $26.
NEUT29|By the time making this video and let's talk about why it actually keeps going up.
NEUT30|So if you guys don't know yes and go to this website okcallshortsqueeze.com and you know there's a lot of information here, you can search.
NEUT31|You know the taker which is going to be WCHS workhorse, and as you can see, there's a couple of things that actually changed, OK?
NEUT32|Yes, I see that the short interest right here is was 23 million concurrent.
NEUT33|Now the short interest is 20 million.
BEAR34|OK, so that's that's actually decrease of 10%.
NEUT35|Now if you don't understand what this means, it means that this is when people bet against the slog.
BEAR36|Meaning like, hey, we think it's going to drop this, yada yada yada right there, begging for it to drop.
NEUT37|But when less people do that, the stock OK value itself actually increases.
NEUT38|And that's exactly what is happening here.
BEAR39|And you guys can see that workers was actually going up.
BEAR40|Obviously after hours it did drop because it is at its all time high's and people probably want to secure their profits.
NEUT41|So right now it did have a little bit of a pullback, so let me know down in the comments section below.
