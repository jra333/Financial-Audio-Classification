BEAR0|"""Francis, you were very bearish on Facebook's IPO when it went public."
NEUT1|Would you invest in Facebook now?
NEUT2|Well Facebook you I am going to 18 and 69 months.
NEUT3|It was 18 to three months and they got their act together and they got more revenue from mobile and they started to make some money and then it went up into the $50 range and this is office spin off a bit when the markets upward I invested in the current price.
NEUT4|No I think it's too expensive.
BULL5|I think I'd look for other companies that have better top line revenue growth.
NEUT6|Increased possibilities when Facebook went public they had a billion users and they still have a billion users.
NEUT7|And they saturate the market in the US and Canada pretty much and whatever growth they had can users, which isn't much was coming in underdeveloped countries.
NEUT8|Who cares about that?
BEAR9|"Because the people in those countries don't have much disposable income."""
