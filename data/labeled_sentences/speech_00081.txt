NEUT0|"""Prevent let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see here today from the red candle."
BEAR1|This red candle has dropped a lot from yesterday and with very big volume compared to the day before yesterday and the normal volume.
NEUT2|So in my opinion, this can be seen as two way.
BEAR3|This is the first that that for the big volume it means so much selling pressure, it's a bearish sign.
NEUT4|But if we check in detail we can see here actually.
NEUT5|On the 18th of September, there's also a huge jump in the volume with the red candle is asserting day, and the very Berry sundae.
NEUT6|But after that actually, it hits the bottom.
NEUT7|So sometimes in the bottom with high volume it means.
NEUT8|Somebody is buying in.
BULL9|After all the way drop down here, then the volume is getting up.
BEAR10|Now if we check this point, we can see from here it dropped all the way here and the volume kept small.
NEUT11|But here we can see the volume has been big, so there can be the second consideration that here maybe somebody already buying in and for short term bottom that's still possible.
NEUT12|'cause if we check the detail we can see here when it touched the law here it bounced a little bit back, so it hesitate to Pierce this law here.
BULL13|So I think it's a positive sign is a bullish sign.
NEUT14|Or Apple, so it's not always.
NEUT15|Bearish sign if we have a big selling volume and if we check it in detail in the day chart, we can see actually.
NEUT16|The law made around 3:00 PM.
BULL17|But actually it has bounced back a little bit at the closing of the market, so there's still possibility for huge bounce back next business day.
BULL18|"Thank you."""
