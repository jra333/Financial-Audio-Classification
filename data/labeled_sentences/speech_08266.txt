BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT3|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL5|Well, another nice day here on this one.
NEUT6|An knowledge is a situation of, you know, is this thing going to keep grinding or is this kind of the end of the line here and the level that I think a lot of people will be watching, rightfully so.
BULL7|It's very well known, very famous level within world charts.
NEUT8|Is that pink line there, which denotes the very famous 200.
NEUT9|Moving average current value that is right up there, around 123 thirty five.
NEUT10|So in my mind, like I said, I think that's going to be a very key level of resistance to watch.
NEUT11|And then the other area that a whole lot of people will be watching which will make this, you know, that makes the analysis makes the chart pretty straightforward, is the key level of support, and that level is just that purple line right there with 50.
NEUT12|Moving average which to give credit credits do.
BULL13|So far so good.
BULL14|I mean did a beautiful job of holding off support.
NEUT15|On Wednesday and then today, you know, with the gap up never really came back into play.
NEUT16|But point here, being from a technical point of view that is still going to remain that you know, key level of support where really, as long as the price stays above that level then that does imply that the prices put in higher lows and higher lows implies that an uptrend is underway.
NEUT17|So I mean that is another very important area.
NEUT18|But like I said, really the two main levels are that pink line right there.
NEUT19|200.
NEUT20|Moving average.
NEUT21|If this is going to continue.
NEUT22|If you know this nice little bounce has any sort of chance of you know, not necessarily gaining traction 'cause it's already got some traction.
NEUT23|Beginning just that much more traction than it's a question of can the price they above that level.
NEUT24|But the level of the watch to kind of just measure the health of the current movement is that purple line.
NEUT25|And even if the price drops a little bit, as long as the price is still above that purple line, then you know it's valid.
NEUT26|It's rational to still say that this current bounces.
NEUT27|You know overall healthy, so keep running those couple areas.
NEUT28|But really, it's as simple as that 200.
NEUT29|Moving average key level resistance, 50.
NEUT30|Moving average key level of support.
NEUT31|So let's see how this one closes out the week on Friday 1st off.
NEUT32|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go.
NEUT33|I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT34|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL35|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT36|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT37|The second key is super awesome because it.
NEUT38|Quite literally, is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it all though, including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT42|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.

NEUT44|That I will send you click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
