NEUT0|"""Did the obsessions of stock market investors make sense and what is now the 8th summer of a long rally for the S&P 500?"
BULL1|Consider Salesforce a company which has always been expensive thanks to excitement about the potential for its business software sold as a subscription service rather than a simple product which is licensed sales have quadrupled in five years, helped by a few acquisitions so the company is valued at a cool $53 billion eight times revenue reported last year.
NEUT2|Then there is Expedia.
NEUT3|Travel agent.
NEUT4|It's two offers, a fast growing online service.
BEAR5|It's doubled sales in the last five years also helped by acquisitions, yet the perception is vicious.
NEUT6|Competition for hotel bookings and car hire.
NEUT7|It makes the business harder to expand, perhaps less valuable and software, and the considered judgment to the market.
NEUT8|Expedia is worth $19 billion around three times sales.
NEUT9|It doesn't help experience case to actually make some profits.
BEAR10|$765 million last year sales force, by comparison, has lost money in each of the last five years.
BEAR11|An accumulated deficit of more than $800 million shareholders.
NEUT12|They were free to imagine what might one day come, untroubled by the reality of profit margins.
NEUT13|Expedia has also repurchased shares over the same.
BULL14|A sign perhaps of diligent maturity Salesforce.
NEUT15|Well, it's given away 1/5 of the company, largely to its staff as a form of pay, a practice which seems to be treated as signal of its great future.
NEUT16|Yet there is one way in which the companies are identical.
NEUT17|Both reported sales of $6.7 billion last year and spent half that amount on sales and marketing just to persuade customers to show up a greater proportion than any other member of the S&P 500.
NEUT18|Ending five years ago, Salesforce was also spending a dollar and marketing that every two it made in sales when it was a quarter of the size for a company with a great future, it appears to work very hard to find and retain customers as Expedia, flights, Priceline and Trip adviser.
BEAR19|So must Salesforce surely battle larger rivals Oracle and Microsoft as of the valuation disparity.
BEAR20|"Perhaps it reflects a more general lack of fast growing companies to buy, or a sort of investment muscle memory about the type of business which is supposed to excite."""
