BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to starts with Superman dude."
NEUT1|Oh yeah, we are back for video #28 out of 100 going in alphabetical order.
NEUT2|Going through the top 100 most popular stocks and given him a grade from zero to 10 based on nine key factors.
NEUT3|Next up on the list is Facebook and the first thing we want to take a look at is what does Facebook do an I think we can answer that without going into too much discovery.
NEUT4|We know what Facebook does now.
NEUT5|If you're not aware, they make a insane amount of money through advertising, and that's one of their main cash flow.
BULL6|Our revenue streams so to advertise on Facebook, is becoming a very, very strong place to advertise because it really they do have the ability to target.
BULL7|The correct audience, and they've shown, even through congressional hearings that yes, they are receiving a lot of information from its users.
NEUT8|But the vast majority of users have stuck with it regardless.
NEUT9|So that's gotta tell you something.
NEUT10|So that's what they do.
NEUT11|Let's take a look at the earnings growth.
BEAR12|We're expected current year off, 12% next year.
BULL13|Expected 19% growth, almost 20 current quarter up, 37% next quarter expected 40% growth.
BULL14|That's good to see.
BULL15|That's real good to see.
NEUT16|Next would be our analyst price target.
NEUT17|We got a price target on Facebook.
NEUT18|Current current price is 258.
NEUT19|Average stock price is 338, that's fantastic.
NEUT20|That's a big move.
NEUT21|We're looking at an 80 point move on a 250 points doctor.
NEUT22|$60.00 stack.
NEUT23|That's a lot.
BULL24|That's a lot that looks real good.
NEUT25|People looks real real good.
NEUT26|Let's take a look at the PE ratio for Facebook P ratio 25.65.
BULL27|That's really good.
NEUT28|I like what I see there.
NEUT29|Let's take a look at the beta while we're here.
NEUT30|1.25.
NEUT31|Not risky.
NEUT32|Liking what I see.
BEAR33|Facebook short interest down 2% bullish but rather new or average or insignificant.
NEUT34|As it is, and then we want to look at the chart.
NEUT35|Let's take a look at the chart.
NEUT36|Over the last five years, Facebook has continued to grow and again, this is all mostly through their advertising revenue streams.
BEAR37|But they've kept a pretty significant upward trend, and I think that we can expect to see that giving consideration the price targets from analysts and things of that nature and also the most recent correction bringing the stack down from 276 all the way down to a lower 253, which it held strong.
NEUT38|I really like this here.
NEUT39|I'd like to see a buy right around 2:57 to 2:55 on Facebook on a scale from zero to 10.
NEUT40|I'm going to give Facebook a 9 out of 10, nine out of 10 baby.
NEUT41|I might actually give it a 10 out of 10.
NEUT42|I'm going to give it a 10 out of 10.
NEUT43|Whoops 10 out of 10 right now.
BULL44|I really do think Facebook looks fantastic right now.
NEUT45|I'm going to write it down in my my thing here.
BULL46|10 out of 10.
