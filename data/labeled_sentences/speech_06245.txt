BULL0|"""So on Friday, markets soared and it almost feels like the market doesn't even want to go down like spies."
BEAR1|At $319 an all time high was $340, so it's literally just a few passengers away and we're still in the middle of like, really crazy economic period.
NEUT2|But this is a true when I called V shape recovery, and we check out the NASDAQ.
NEUT3|It's already hitting all time highs, check out the futures for that day, which was Friday, June 5th.
NEUT4|It's absolutely mooning like 3% for the Dow like.
NEUT5|There's good reason why is pretty much if you look at the unemployment rate.
BEAR6|Those stocks surging after huge amounts of U.S. jobs, so they're adding in about 2.5 million jobs in May, unemployment fell 13.3%.
BULL7|That is good news mean that more Americans are working.
NEUT8|People are paying bills.
NEUT9|And what happens with more people work?
NEUT10|Well, we got more people going to Whole Foods and buying that expensive cheese and then those farms make more money and they use that money to pay their employees and employees use that money to buy things that they need.
NEUT11|Stuff like that.
NEUT12|It's like this.
BULL13|Really nice.
BEAR14|Economic chain you can see here, Dow showing 829 points after surprising jobs report and this is sudden like right away people started noticing that was more jobs and a bunch of people are getting really hyped up.
BEAR15|Even though we still have a lot of unemployment rates.
BULL16|It's good.
NEUT17|I mean you've got more jobs now.
BEAR18|It's falling on the daily since you know.
NEUT19|Obviously states are reopening up and when states are reopening up, that's a good news because you got hotels, restaurants and also schools opening up mean that people have jobs.
NEUT20|Now if you check out airlines, if you guys don't know the airlines, hotel and hospitality industry is absolutely huge and they're on an absolute moon mission.
BULL21|If you look at the airline stocks so far the hypest stock right now and so far they're doing extremely well and jobs are coming back.
NEUT22|Is the job market that's really pushing the economy forward.
BEAR23|So keep in mind I've been saying is quite sometime this crazy pandemic and this major job loss around early April late March.
NEUT24|It was only for a short amount of time.
NEUT25|This isn't like, you know, the 1929 crash, or like the 08 crash where people literally didn't have jobs for years and years.
NEUT26|This is just temporary an after this crazy pandemic blows over and when it's safe to go outside without a mask I can pretty much guarantee you all the other jobs will resume back to normal.
NEUT27|And everything is all fine and dandy, so you got this really insane V shape recovery.
NEUT28|This is literally what you call V shape recovery.
NEUT29|Now there were some hiccups around, you know, early May, but we're going to or that you can just Click to see how find that line is.
BULL30|Banks are returning to all time highs.
BULL31|Airlines are trying to all time highs and things are just looking really good for the market and there is a lot of money still to be made.
BULL32|"Thanks for watching."""
