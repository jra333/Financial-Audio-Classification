NEUT0|"""If you could take your money out of Apple out of a Tesla and you had to keep it in in tech land companies, you cover, you'd put it where?"
NEUT1|Well, look, I think more broadly, if we you know a lot of people ask us about Fang and how do we think about relative thing and you know our observation.
NEUT2|And this is this is a house view.
NEUT3|You know, Bernstein covers the other Fang stocks is when we look at the valuation of Apple.
BULL4|It's trading above the valuation of Facebook and Google and pretty close in line with Microsoft.
BEAR5|And so if we were looking to migrate within large cap tech, you know at Bernstein we have outperform ratings on those other three bank stocks.
BEAR6|Simply because we think their growth prospects are better than apples and they're trading at or below Apple's current valuation.
NEUT7|So you know, I would say within the context of a very large cap tech, you know as a firm, that's what we would be recommending.
NEUT8|What do you do in EV land?
NEUT9|Or, you know, we've I think he'd be land is is very, very tricky.
BEAR10|I mean, if I if I kind of step back and I look at the aggregate valuation of the broader automotive sector, it's basically doubled over the last year.
BULL11|Now a lot of that is Tesla, maybe 60% of that increases Tesla, but you still had the market go up about 40 or 50% from other EV new EV entrance.
NEUT12|So you've had a marketplace that is becoming.
BULL13|Increasingly competitive, the number of new competitors entering this space is tremendous.
BULL14|Both domestically and overseas in terms of pure EV players, you also have the traditional OEM's who are ramping up EV product, so you've had an industry that's become dramatically more competitive and yet.
NEUT15|You know when we look when we look at the aggregate market capitalization of that industry, it's more than doubled and and and that doesn't resonate with me.
NEUT16|My my belief is the global automotive industry is a hyper competitive industry.
NEUT17|It always has been.
NEUT18|No one has more than 10% share their local market preferences.
BULL19|There's been tremendous innovation in terms of electronics and safety over the last 15 years, but margins haven't gone up for automotive country companies.
NEUT20|So So what we're seeing is we're seeing a bit up in the entire space.
BULL21|And that that just doesn't resonate with me I, I think 25 years from now there will be fewer cars sold and I'm not so sure the margins are necessarily going to be better because it's such a competitive industry.
