NEUT4|2020 saw some notable tech names up for a public listing.
NEUT5|Despite the COVID-19 disruptions, one such company is data analytics provider Palantir Technologies, which started trading on the NYSE in September via direct listing instead of the traditional IPO route.
BEAR6|Founded in 2003, Palantir has been in the news due to some controversial contracts with government agencies.

NEUT8|More than half of the company's revenue comes from government contracts.
BEAR9|Critics often draw attention to some of the company's controversial contracts, like the one to track undocumented immigrants, which have resulted in protest from social and political activists.
BULL10|Nonetheless, the US government sector remains a primary area of focus for Palantir in Q3, it wanna $91 million contract from the US Army in a $36 million contract from the National Institutes of Health.
BULL11|NIH earlier this month, the company was awarded a $44.4 million three year contract with the US FDA.
BULL12|Palantir shares have exploded about 161% since the beginning of November with the company's stellar three Q revenue growth being one of the reasons for the spike.
BULL13|Third quarter revenue grew 52% year over year to $289 million.
BULL14|However, net gains increased substantially in three Q due to stock based compensation expenses related to the company's direct listing.

BULL22|Three Q results highlighted sustain momentum in the government vertical accelerating growth in the enterprise business and record margins of over 25%, thus representing a slight fundamental uptick versus initial expectations.
