BULL0|"""Fire up merk."
NEUT1|I folks I have a PhD in chemistry, so these chemical companies are near and dear to my heart.
NEUT2|Go ahead Paul.
NEUT3|$100 billion company.
NEUT4|It's called 100 billion, eighteen PE.
BULL5|So an X there, but not terribly nice profit margin expected with drug companies.
BULL6|23.4% Pillar #3 revenue growth.
NEUT7|39.539 point 840-4247.
NEUT8|Now here's the interesting thing to check.
NEUT9|Mark pharmaceutical companies like acquisitions.
NEUT10|This doesn't look like a lot of acquisitions been made.
NEUT11|Maybe they have been.
NEUT12|I don't know, but they tend to like acquisitions, so either way it's still a check mark that income.
NEUT13|4.442 point, 46.29 point, 8 definite check mark.
NEUT14|There are number of shares outstanding.
BULL15|2.82 point 5-6 another second current assets greater than current liabilities is building number 616 point 6 billion in current assets 20.4 in current liabilities so they have six and change in extra cash lying around which is good free cash flow growth over the past five years.
NEUT16|11.38 point 74.68 point 310.
NEUT17|So check Mark for growth.
NEUT18|The average is 8 1/2 * 2171.6 close.
NEUT19|Not there yet, but close, so it is a little expensive.
BULL20|Based on the free cash flow will expensive in the PE, but if you think there's a lot of growth potential there that could be justified in this nice dividend.
NEUT21|I would still be waiting a little bit to buy it.
BEAR22|It's already seem like it's dropping down a little bit the last year it was at a peak of 92 down to 81 down here.
NEUT23|I've definitely been buying so where where my buyer at?
NEUT24|I don't know.
NEUT25|Maybe maybe moment I can do some research and look at this one and probably buy at The thing is guys.
NEUT26|I'm a value investor going to buy it a massive discount to where I think the value is.
NEUT27|So I think the value is 70 bucks.
NEUT28|Here I want to buy it like 40 or $50.
BEAR29|I look for companies selling we have below their actual value, so that's the big thing to understand here.
NEUT30|Like I want to buy Merck much lower than this.
NEUT31|So let's look at the momentum here for Merck.
NEUT32|So this is 1 to watch because the momentum just shifted.
BEAR33|So right now it has some negative momentum going which is fine.
NEUT34|Just to wait for this to go above the future date.
NEUT35|So that's where it's at right now.
NEUT36|But last time it crossed over was in October of 18.
NEUT37|At 71 and you would have sold at 78.
NEUT38|You made a little bit of money, so you bought it 71 and it got all the way to 92 and you're giving back profits all the way to 78.
NEUT39|That's what this training does that you lose out on.
NEUT40|You don't get the high in the low.
NEUT41|"You get somewhere in the middle, but it's more consistent."""
