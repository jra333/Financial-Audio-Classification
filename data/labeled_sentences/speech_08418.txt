NEUT7|Let's check out some charts.
NEUT8|Everyone before we get into the tech sector just want to let you all know that we're doing our end of the year sale here where we have an annual membership and a free course of your choosing, either the entries and exits or the crypto course or 699 to save a couple $100.
NEUT9|The code is Friday 699.
NEUT10|We have a limited number available.
NEUT11|An IF that code were to get rejected that means we are full up, but check it out if you're interested.
BULL12|So let's look at the tech sector which was very strong today breaking out to higher highs.
BEAR13|Inside Barbul break with the gap up open and we were not looking back from there.
BEAR14|The all time high hit very early over 6402.
BULL15|Sixty 4:30 is the new high and we closed near the high of the day and a lot of names are closing really strong.
BULL16|Amazon's on the verge of an all time high Google closed really strong.
NEUT17|Will see Facebook and Apple here but the Bulls are looking for more.
NEUT18|Tomorrow is the bottom line tomorrow's our last full trading day of the week.
BEAR19|We've got 1/2 day on Friday and Thursday is off so we're looking at 6450 and 65.
NEUT20|Psychological resistance is from here.
BULL21|Middle Bollinger Band continuing to head on higher.
NEUT22|And the weekly timeframe.
BULL23|Little Bull Flag is now confirmed with Continuation, so an ideal holiday week so far for the markets.
NEUT24|Apple on the daily timeframe.
NEUT25|Big Bull break of one 7187.
BULL26|Today we have our love the pullback hide the bounce higher low is 169 fifty six and now we have that higher high so the momentum is back to favoring the Bulls.
NEUT27|The Mac D wasn't even tested.
BULL28|That continues to ascend rapidly and from here we're just looking for higher lows and higher highs in terms of resistance.
NEUT29|After one 7370 we're looking at one 7450 and then really just the all time high of 175 sixty one after that so an extremely strong close for the Bulls.
BULL30|The weekly time frame is also a potential bull flag and a new all time high.
NEUT31|Would certainly confirm that the weekly Upper Bollinger band resistance from here is one 7473 and we're keeping an eye on that level.
NEUT32|That's really the only resistance we're looking at in the short term, aside from those other two levels that I mentioned.
BULL33|But bulls with the volume spike and the market the sector I should say, certainly favoring the Bulls overall, look at Facebook's day.
NEUT34|That's a big day bull break.
BULL35|Initially, at 180 was a signal that gave us a little higher low and higher high.
BULL36|We also got a break of one 8075.
NEUT37|We're now looking at one 8194.
NEUT38|And the all time high one 8290.
NEUT39|That's the only two resistances.
BULL40|The clothes at the high of the day is very strong.
NEUT41|Bull Mcdee Cross is ready and waiting weekly consolidation a little bull flag trying to be confirmed.
NEUT42|You can see the common theme here with most of the tech sector on the weekly time frame.
BULL43|With that brief two weeks of consolidation has formed bull flags and is now trying to confirm the mall with higher highs.
NEUT44|So market bulls are still running the show.
BULL45|Tech sector is still extremely strong and the vast majority of names trying to get new all time highs.
BEAR46|So the Upper Bollinger Band Weekly Resistance one 8268.
BULL47|Will be in play as we look to the all time high at one 8290, so we'll have to see the Bulls are able to close over that level.
NEUT48|We don't close over.
NEUT49|It often.
NEUT50|Look at this last year and a half.
NEUT51|We closed over at one time on the weekly time frame.
NEUT52|Every other breakout attempt has rejected from this Upper Bollinger band so many more rejections than breakouts have to keep that in mind.
NEUT53|So all time high tests coming for Facebook tomorrow.
BULL54|"I appreciate you watching and we will see you tomorrow after the close."""
