BEAR0|"""What's up guys feeding information there so Facebook is up huge in the after market right now."
NEUT1|Post market, whatever you want to call it 8.52%.
BULL2|So basically up like 13 bucks in terms of share price.
NEUT3|But anyways just wanted to start off with that.
NEUT4|Just 'cause that's awesome.
BULL5|EPS was 2.38, so it beat by .2.
BULL6|The revenue was 16.91 billion, up 30% year over year and beats by 510,000,000, not bad, half a billion it beat by.
NEUT7|Anyways, let's go ahead and dig more into it.
BULL8|Facebook up seven point, 1% after profit jumped 61% for Easy Beat.
BULL9|Now it's up 8 point something percent.
BULL10|Revenues rose 30% to 16.9 billion.
BULL11|Mobile advertising revenue made up 93% of ad revenue up from the prior years 89%.
BULL12|So a 4% increase net income jumped 61% to 6.88 billion.
BEAR13|Income from operations rose just 6% to 7.82 billion and operating margin fell to 46% from 57%.
BEAR14|But a sharp drop 66% in provision for income taxes made a big difference.
BEAR15|The company's effective tax rate dropped to 14% from 43% the year prior.
BULL16|Not bad.
BULL17|Daily active users were up 9% year over year in December to 1.52 billion on average.
BULL18|Monthly active users were also up 9% to 2.32 billion.
NEUT19|The company says it also estimates 2.7 people use the company service.
NEUT20|OK, it's definitely said this.
NEUT21|I believe in the last earnings.
NEUT22|So we are.
NEUT23|We already know that about 3 billion people use it each and every month.
NEUT24|But anyways, that was pretty much it in terms of covering it.
BULL25|Yeah, I do still have stash up.
NEUT26|I wanted to go ahead just like I did in the last two videos.
NEUT27|If it would load.
NEUT28|To go ahead and show you where it is on My Portfolio, I believe it's like 5th or 6th.
NEUT29|What is that 1234 yes so 5th on the list at $130.
NEUT30|I'm buying on 10% dips.
BEAR31|I don't think it will be on a 10% dip with an earnings like that, but that's perfectly fine.
NEUT32|'cause out of all the stocks on this portfolio.
NEUT33|As much as I love Facebook and the fact that it's always just ad revenue and stuff and we don't know what companies are specifically paying that revenue or not really like that revenue, but paying them for those ads, it kind of bothers me 'cause what.
NEUT34|What if one company decides lever this company decides.
NEUT35|Is Facebook going to say so?
NEUT36|This company chose to leave?
BEAR37|We've lost this much of our ad revenue.
BEAR38|I don't feel like they're going to tell us that, so that bothers me.
NEUT39|But Facebook is a very cheap stock in a very rapid high growth revenue machine, so I love the company.
NEUT40|Anyways, that was pretty much it.
NEUT41|"If you enjoy this video, throw me a like and feed you information out."""
