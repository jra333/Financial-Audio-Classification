BEAR0|"""It has been a roller coaster day for U.S. stocks."
BEAR1|The major indexes starting the day with gains due to a possible debt ceiling compromise only to see it all wiped out by those dismal manufacturing numbers.
BULL2|Now by late day though, another move to the upside.
BEAR3|Although the markets closed lower, Deborah Caution has been following the twists and turns from the New York Stock Exchange Deborah.
NEUT4|That's right, Pam, a lot of twists and turns because the Dow Jones industrial average had this 285 point trading range, so a lot going on today market starting off.
BULL5|Very strong but losing their fizzle.
BEAR6|The SNP ending up falling for a six day in a row.
NEUT7|The rally over the compromised raise the debt ceiling pretty much lasted only about 30 minutes, but that report on manufacturing taking center stage an when we found it in manufacturing pretty much stalled out in July.
BEAR8|Economists also saying that the economy just not picking up momentum in the second half.
BEAR9|The big concern is the soft economy could tosses back into a recession.
BULL10|And it wasn't just here in the US either, because factory growth slowing down in Europe and also China is helpin.
NEUT11|Now Deborah, the compromise over the debt ceiling.
BEAR12|That could mean what some major cuts for Medicare providers.
NEUT13|We saw cuts that are announced with 11% decline that this happened to do with nursing homes, right?
BEAR14|So health care stocks leading the declines in the S&P 500.
NEUT15|This is after President Obama announcing that the debt reduction plan may lead to these Medicare cuts.
NEUT16|The reduction would be aimed at provider payments and not to do not to benefits.
BEAR17|And that's why companies like well, point in HCA, saw some of the biggest declines at in today's session now also cyclical stocks among the biggest losers, and that's probably not too much of a surprise given the concern on the state of the economy.
NEUT18|After today's manufacturing report.
NEUT19|So all the a lot of the cyclical stocks like FedEx really losing quite a bit of ground pin back to you.
BULL20|Thank you very much.
