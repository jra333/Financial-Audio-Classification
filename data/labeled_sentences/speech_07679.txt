NEUT0|"""Yes, Sir, my name is Tom Conrad and I'm from McLean, VA and I'm a shareholder and I asked a question last year that for Buffett to you I was struck with what you said that it takes only three quality companies to be to invest into the set for a lifetime."
NEUT1|And I asked the question should last year should I wait until the market goes down or should I get in now an you advised to get in now and the three companies night shows with Coca Cola, Gillette and Disney and because of that advice I was able to.
NEUT2|For the ticket to come back this year.
NEUT3|Question.
NEUT4|Question is this.
NEUT5|I think you ought to quit loggerhead but go ahead.
NEUT6|Expanding to a fourth company.
NEUT7|Thinking of just McDonald's and I just wanted to ask you if you feel that McDonald's has the same ability to dominate the way Coca Cola and Gillette has.
NEUT8|And Secondly you feel that the answer is yes, that I should wait until the price comes down a bit or getting now.
NEUT9|And that's my question.
NEUT10|Would you like it to the 8th of a point or should we round off the.
NEUT11|We in the annual report we we talked about.
NEUT12|Coca Cola and Angelette in terms of their base business being what I called the inevitables and but that that related to obviously to the soft drink business in the case of Coca Cola, in the shaving product, would you let it doesn't extend every necessarily everything they do, but Fortunately in both those companies those are very important product.
NEUT13|So I would say that in the food business you would never get the total certainty of dominance that you would get.
NEUT14|In in, in, in products like Coca Cola and Gillette people people move around in the food business from where they eat from that they may.
NEUT15|They may favor McDonald's, but they will go to different places at different times and somebody starts shaving with a Gillette sensor plus is very unlikely to go elsewhere in my view and so they do not.
NEUT16|You just you never would get in the food business.
NEUT17|In my judgment, quite the inevitability that you would get in.
NEUT18|In the soft drink business with a Coca Cola, you'll never get it again in the soft drink business.
NEUT19|I mean it took 100.
NEUT20|Yes to the 1886 so be about 111 years to get to the point where they are and the infrastructure is incredible and so.
NEUT21|I wouldn't put it quite in the same class in terms of inevitability.
NEUT22|That doesn't mean it can be a better stock investment, depending on the price, but you're not going to get the price for me.
NEUT23|And knowing Charlie, I doubt if you'll get the price.
BULL24|Remember, will give him a chance.
NEUT25|He's breathing, folks.
NEUT26|He's breathing.
NEUT27|We've got this down to routine.
NEUT28|So I have nothing to add 1.
NEUT29|I didn't have anything to say either.
NEUT30|"I just took longer."""
