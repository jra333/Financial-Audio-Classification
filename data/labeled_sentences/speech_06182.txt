NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of into it is ranged between $6.29 per share and $68.71 per share."
NEUT1|How were those values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $6.29 per share represents the company's cash for every share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $6.29 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $68.71 per share represents the company's earnings.
NEUT4|So a price of $68.71 per share represents the fractional payment.
NEUT5|We would all pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT6|A conservative way to value a company that's different than the PE ratio.
NEUT7|So the big question is what are they trading at now?
NEUT8|Into it's currently trading at a price of $325.34 which is massively overpriced and you can take a look at this PE ratio here to abet our fundamental analysis.
NEUT9|Yes, we can use some bits of technical analysis to come to a more refined conclusion.
NEUT10|An anything above 20.
NEUT11|Benjamin Graham says that we should avoid so at this time the price is not attractive through several signals.
NEUT12|But what's the alternative?
NEUT13|So we need one that's going to maintain our our safety of principle and maintain an ample margin of safety.
NEUT14|So what we would do is invest in the Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT15|Now, I'm not financially related to these folks.
NEUT16|Vanguards not paying me to say this.
NEUT17|I'm only choosing him 'cause I know.
NEUT18|Warren Buffett used these guys to win a bet in that he started in 2008 against the hedge fund industry.
NEUT19|But what we would do is invest in Vanguard 500 until this price here becomes lower than this price here of $68.71.
NEUT20|Now if you're watching this video sometime in the future, make sure you have updated.
NEUT21|Annual figures I'm using fiscal year 2019.
NEUT22|That's only because it's the only.
