NEUT0|"""What will cause the next big financial crisis?"
NEUT1|I knew what was going to cause the next crisis.
NEUT2|I wouldn't be there.
NEUT3|I think the next financial crisis is several years into the future.
NEUT4|Financial crises are caused by excesses.
NEUT5|I have to tell you, I just don't see these large fundamental sort of excess is.
NEUT6|I see some areas that I don't love.
NEUT7|Things like high yield, an emerging market debt, but again, those are really modest if they're not going to create these massive, massive problems like those mortgages and the mortgage derivatives that completely polluted the, you know, the global banking system.
NEUT8|And created a crisis that we're kind of still living through the waves today.
NEUT9|I am not worried at all about a financial crisis.
BULL10|This is a benign, very strong economic environment, and while it will be maybe more volatile than we're used to over the last decade, I think we're in very good shape and I think it's going to be.
NEUT11|It's going to be triggered by the three classic events.
BULL12|Interest rates will peak.
BEAR13|The economy will slow down and then defaults will peak.
