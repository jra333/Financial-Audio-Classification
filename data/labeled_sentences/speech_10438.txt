BULL0|"""Now Tesla reported last night, and while the stock barely budged today, the fact is they delivered some fantastic results."
BULL1|This was a clean top and bottom line beat.
NEUT2|No funny business leisure demand.
BEAR3|Nothing with 1.4 billion in cash flow double what Wall Street was looking for.
BULL4|Tesla hit its aggressive US build targets for the quarter and they still think they can make a half million Model 3 and Model Y units in America this year along with the other two 50,000 model threes in China.
NEUT5|Elon Musk is even planting the flag in the global capital, the auto industry with the Berlin plan that will start producing cars from Europe next year.
NEUT6|We'll see the Tesla truck made in Austin sometime next year too.
BEAR7|They've left the old school automakers in the dust at this point.
NEUT8|It's not even a fair comparison.
BULL9|Even though Tesla spent 2.4 billion or new production capacity service centers and supercharging locations, among other items, their cash still increased by 5.9 billion, bringing their total hoard up to 14.5 billion.
NEUT10|I can remember only about a year ago, when people still worried that Esther was functionally bankrupt.
BULL11|Yeah, I could argue that it's got the best balance sheet.
NEUT12|The industry most important for once Elon Musk conducted a flawless conference call, comported himself, well, not eccentric, not kind of sending thought a farcical off Broadway comedy.
NEUT13|He played it straight.
NEUT14|How many CEOs wish they could kick off their call with saying and I quote?
NEUT15|Alright?
BULL16|So Q3 was our best quarter in history.
BULL17|We achieved record production deliveries, record revenue record, net income, both gap and non gap.
BULL18|And record free cash flow of $1.4 billion in quote.
BULL19|He actually sounded gracious, maybe even a little humble when he thanked his employees and suppliers.
BULL20|Humility from Elon Musk.
NEUT21|Will wonders never cease?
BULL22|He went on to talk about cost control, improving quality, making the cars more affordable.
NEUT23|And then he finishes saying quote, I've never felt more optimistic about the future of Tesla than I do today.
BULL24|Also, I'd like to thank the investors who have stuck with us through thick and thin.
NEUT25|I think there's a lot more good stuff to come in quote.
NEUT26|No hyperbole.
NEUT27|I mean, I know that sounds like standard corporate problem, right?
NEUT28|So what separates separates Elon Musk from every other CEOs paid to sound optimistic about the future and make nice with investors two things.
NEUT29|First, those are the guys don't have his track record and 2nd and more important, we've waited years to hear this kind of boring CEO talk from Elon Musk.
NEUT30|We're used to hearing him Rang the idiot analysts or the stupid SEC or the foolish critics.
NEUT31|Sometimes you had to wonder if he just smoked a doobie this time.
NEUT32|He sounded like he was channeling Lincoln second inaugural males, Tord none charity for all.
NEUT33|Listen, this guy is taking a situation that was easy to dump, were many and also it's already in the stock.
NEUT34|Some of them even predicted bankruptcy and he's turned it into a $400 billion business.
NEUT35|At this point, Tesla transcended the auto industry.
NEUT36|It is a tech company.
NEUT37|It's fair to how to store clean energy and then use it to fuel cars.
NEUT38|And who knows what else?
NEUT39|Most automakers have to spend more money advertising than Tesla spends on building new factories.
NEUT40|They blanket the airwaves with ads nobody wants to see, not even the ones voiced by the Great John Slattery test.
NEUT41|Only on there doesn't need to advertise product itself.
NEUT42|Don't miss a second of mad money.
