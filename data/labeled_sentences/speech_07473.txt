BULL0|"""So if you haven't heard already, the UK is poised to be the first country in the world to release and approve a COVID-19 vaccine."
NEUT1|What do we think about that?
NEUT2|So this could be ready as early as next week, so the UK just approved the use of the Pfizer and Bio and tech vaccine for coronavirus for widespread use throughout the UK.
BULL3|British regulators MHRA have announced that his magazine offers up to 95% protection to the COVID-19 illness and is safe to roll out next week.
BULL4|The UK has already ordered 40 million doses, just enough to vaccinate 20 million people.
NEUT5|10 million doses should be available soon.
NEUT6|An 800,000 will be arriving in the UK in the coming days.
NEUT7|Here are the quick facts that you need to know.
NEUT8|This is now the fastest a vaccine has ever come to light.
NEUT9|With only ten months of research and development to now it being approved, it's the fastest time in history.
NEUT10|The information from the World Health Organization is, although the vaccine is here, people still need to remain vigilant and still following the normal guidelines that we have been for the last, you know, six months.
NEUT11|So what exactly is the vaccine?
NEUT12|I know I want to find out, so let's find out together.
NEUT13|It is a new type called the M RNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of the genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach them.
NEUT14|Body how to fight against the COVID-19 virus and then create immunity to it.
NEUT15|The M RNA vaccine has never been approved for human consumption or human use, but it has been given to patients in the past.
NEUT16|So how exactly is the RNA vaccine going to work?
NEUT17|Scientists take apart of the viruses, genetic code or RNA that tells the cells what to build and coat them in a lipid so that they can enter the body cells is injected into the patient using a syringe.
NEUT18|Vaccine enters the cells and tells them to produce a coronavirus.
NEUT19|Spike proteins prompts the immune system.
NEUT20|To produce antibodies and activate T cells to destroy the infected cells.
NEUT21|If the patient encounters coronavirus, the antibodies and T cells are triggered to fight the virus, who will get the vaccine and when so the first people to get the immunity jet will be people over 50 and younger.
NEUT22|People with pre existing conditions that will need two doses.
NEUT23|The first one comes and then 21 days later they have the second.
NEUT24|Yeah, that's it.
NEUT25|You're up to date with what's happening with the virus today.
NEUT26|This is just fresh news.
NEUT27|This article came out 26 minutes ago and I just thought I'd do something a little bit different and let you guys know what's happening because it really interests me and it's on.
NEUT28|On my mind all day, so I just want to keep you guys up to date.
NEUT29|What I think how this will personally affect us investors and people like that.
BEAR30|I think that's something that you should watch right now in the stock market will be travel and restaurants and things like that that have been really beaten down during this market because now there's a vaccine.
NEUT31|The lights at the end of the tunnel people are going to start going out again.
NEUT32|You know in the next, let's say six months people are going to start feeling safer again and they're going to start going out and they're going to be going, travelling and cruise ships and things like that.
NEUT33|So look into these markets and see if there's any way that you think you can make some money.
NEUT34|I think we need to still stay on the side of caution.
NEUT35|Obviously when you go out be safe.
NEUT36|There is also a possibility that this might not work out, so right now I think in the next coming weeks we're going to see euphoria in the stock market, which is basically if you look at this graph, I'll put it up here.
NEUT37|You can see how it goes all the way up to the euphoric stage and basically we're going to see that now.
NEUT38|I reckon people are going to start really certain that this is it and they're going to start flooding into the market and the market is going to go up, so be careful with trying to catch a run up like that.
NEUT39|That's my advice to you.
NEUT40|Let me know what you think.
