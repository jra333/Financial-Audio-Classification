BEAR0|"""China is normalizing becaused at, you know, be a pandemic."
BEAR1|Pandemic is under control issues.
NEUT2|Get hardware.
NEUT3|Where do we go from here and now the leadership is talking about internal circulation.
NEUT4|We don't know what it means.
NEUT5|Yeah, actually the right thing is rebound to economy.
NEUT6|You need to balance investment again against consumption because it was so far we still see that the government is still popping up investment.
BULL7|To get the economy going so that means that we have more overcapacity down the road, so there with China is facing an enormous challenge in terms of.
BULL8|Future exports and there's a urgent need to re balance the economy to shift in the coming two consumption, but so far is still talk, so this is in balance will weigh on corporate profits in the coming years.
BEAR9|And it seems like you're suggesting that some of this support that has come from the government to help and forth the impact of the coronavirus is leading to a market bubble.
NEUT10|Do you see us in a bubble right now, and if So what will it take to burst that bubble?
NEUT11|Oh, there's a huge bubble in the wash. Just like Y2K.
NEUT12|No, people maybe in May not remember.
NEUT13|No, but with a 2000 people were scared all the computers would stop walking and the federal public alot of money that led to the start come bubble.

BEAR19|It could be a catastrophe that China is there like a challenge being keeping the property market going for a long time.
NEUT20|The property market is being in bubble territory for for a long time, but the you know China is supporting the property market by kind of using the banks to support public developers when they're in trouble.
NEUT21|Don't pull the don't, don't don't pull pull, force them to repay.
NEUT22|So this kind of a strategy has kept this very property market going, and I it's it's.
NEUT23|We don't know where do we go from here because of the government.
NEUT24|Seems to think that they can do this forever, but I think that the issue is still the US market.
BEAR25|"If you guys stock market pops it will be a huge knock on effect on China's financial asset markets."""
