NEUT0|"""One of the first things Joe Biden wants to do when he takes office is to cancel."
NEUT1|All are part of outstanding student debt.
BEAR2|This however, poses two big problems.
NEUT3|Hello, I'm Steve Forbes and this is what's ahead when you get the insights you need to help navigate this turbulent world.
BEAR4|Cancelling student debt poses two daunting difficulties.
NEUT5|First, it doesn't deal with the root cause of the crisis out of control.
BEAR6|Tuitions forgive debts today an in a few years we'll be back to where we are now with another round of cries for cancellations.
BEAR7|There is no justifiable reason why colleges and universities sticker prices have been going up four times.
BEAR8|The rate of inflation are institutions of higher learning, are afflicted with bureaucratic obesity.
BEAR9|Ministrat if expenses have skyrocketed or outlays for classroom instruction of lag far, far behind sloppy management is the norm.
BULL10|Studies have shown, in fact, that the very government programs meant to help students pay these rising costs have given colleges an incentive to keep boosting tuitions.
BULL11|These institutions know Uncle Sam through more and more loans and grants will get money to students and their families to pay ever rising prices.
NEUT12|It's a great racket.
BEAR13|Colleges get the money while students get stuck with the debt.
NEUT14|This corrupt gravy train must be derailed once and for all at the least, colleges should be liable for part of a students debt.
NEUT15|Second is the issue of fairness.
NEUT16|There are 255 million adults in this country, 45 million of them have student debts.
NEUT17|Why should the other 210,000,000 subsidise that 45 million?
NEUT18|Most Americans don't even go to college.
NEUT19|The unemployment rate for non college graduates.
NEUT20|Is almost twice that of those with degrees.
NEUT21|And what about all those students who paid off their debts where they fools for taking these obligations seriously?
NEUT22|In the same vein, what about those students who took on jobs to help pay college costs instead of borrowing more?
NEUT23|Or they fools as well?
NEUT24|And what about those students who went to lower cost public universities rather than more expensive private ones to save on expenses and avoid taking on larger debt burdens?
NEUT25|Should they have been so prudent?
NEUT26|What incentive will there be in the future to be so responsible?
NEUT27|Knowing that any debt taken on will likely be forgiven.
BULL28|The government already has programs that tie debt repayments, including forgiveness after a certain number of years to a percentage of future incomes, thereby easing burdens of graduates who don't haul in big bucks in the workforce.
NEUT29|Amazingly, less than half of graduates with debt take advantage of these programs.
NEUT30|Now that's an education challenge of a different kind.
NEUT31|I'm Steve Forbes.
NEUT32|Thank you for listening.
BULL33|"Do send in your comments and suggestions and look forward to being with you soon again."""
