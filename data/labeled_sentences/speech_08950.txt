NEUT0|"""Of Apple this morning without form rating and a price target of $171.00."
BULL1|Sir, good to see.
BULL2|Much thanks so much for for joining us.
NEUT3|I mean let's start on that particular topic about whether Apple should start to get it more broadly into the crypto space.
NEUT4|Bitcoin in particular, and whether you think it could be an opportunity for them.
NEUT5|Yeah, so I really do believe this is a pretty clear opportunity in my opinion, because if you look at squares R&D budget, they spend about $670 million per year Apple spends or sorry generates cash flow of that amount in less than two and a half days.
NEUT6|So the amount of R&D expenses would hit it would take to kind of create a crypto exchange for them.
NEUT7|Just to be clear, you don't even need to own any crypto assets, they could just create an exchange and if you run that map coin base right now is going public through a direct listing right?
NEUT8|And their value to 50 two $80 billion with only 35 million.
NEUT9|People as their install base.
NEUT10|Apple has a 1.5 billion installed base and they sell 200,000,000 phones per year.
NEUT11|So what prevents Apple from utilizing its best asset?
NEUT12|Which is software, it closed ecosystem and basically putting people onto a crypto wallet and then making money off the fees?
NEUT13|So again there's been a lot of news here saying that I think they should buy and all this other stuff, but really the clear message is why can't they just become an exchange?
NEUT14|Use this software and just get fees based on the exchange of crypto assets.
NEUT15|I don't think that cryptocurrency is going away anytime soon, and so if they just simply become the exchange, it's a low risk way.
NEUT16|Then the utilized most valuable part of their asset which is security and software.
NEUT17|Do you expect this to happen?
NEUT18|You reporting on this based on on any expectations.
NEUT19|Anything you've heard from the company or is just your analysis of an opportunity that they have.
NEUT20|This is just solely my entire analysis file.
NEUT21|If I was working at Apple's strategy Officer, this is legitimately something I would do, because if you can invest $500 million to potentially create 50 to $80 billion in equity value, that's a lot more compelling to me than trying to compete against an Elon Musk and Tesla, a distributed energy company.
NEUT22|We're going to spend 15 to $20 billion just for a maybe just for.
NEUT23|Full disclosure here.
NEUT24|I do own GB TC and test, so I don't want people to.
NEUT25|I believe that I'm trying to make any sort of nefarious activity here, and it's like that, but it just doesn't make any logical sense right?
NEUT26|If you have a 200,000,000 person install base and you can create value out of that with just creating a small exchange, why wouldn't you do it so?
BEAR27|So far the feedback for investors I've got is that it sounds like it's out of left field.
NEUT28|But again, if you don't think that exchanges are going away any soon anytime soon, why wouldn't you do this?
NEUT29|Well, I think 2 reasons one it could open you up to all kinds of new regulatory scrutiny when they're all focused on Bitcoin becoming a Bitcoin exchange.
BULL30|But also, I mean, you're assuming the big gains if the price continues to go up, which I'm not sure that that's necessarily.
NEUT31|I a universal idea, a lot of people still think this is a massive bubble, and it's worth nothing.
NEUT32|So again, they don't even have to own the Bitcoin, right?
NEUT33|So that second part I don't agree with that.
NEUT34|What I'm saying is they can basically just be the exchange, but say you wanted to buy a big corner fraction of a Bitcoin.
NEUT35|Just going here, Apple on you click buy they take a .01% fee or something small right?
NEUT36|Then at that point you just making money on the exchange and in terms of the regulatory part task, those involved now squares involved.
NEUT37|Now you also got micro strategy involves right PayPal is involved, they did it legally right in a closed system.
NEUT38|Again a closed system guarantees.
NEUT39|That you can't take something off the exchange because they're keeping it within the ecosystem, so why wouldn't they be able to do the same thing?
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
