NEUT0|"""It's claimed this via video chart on ticker symbol AA BB."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Well, it's been a while since I've done this one, but I want to keep the keep things updated just because I know there are a lot of people that are watching this one an All in all, I kind of build it up, but there's nothing really new to report or the fact that the price has been stained between these two main levels and the two main levels making up, and this will mean more to those that have watched past videos.
NEUT5|But the sideways channel that I've talked about top of the channel being that red line up there at 26 cents.
NEUT6|Bob in the channel down there at $0.22 an as you can see right now, the price is literally just continuing to shop back and forth between these areas.
NEUT7|Now I probably should make an adjustment.
BULL8|'cause it looks as though the channel a little bit wider than what I thought it was now that we have more data.
NEUT9|So I'm going to just the bottom of the channel down there to the 21 cent mark, which does a better job of incorporating.
BEAR10|These couple of situations where the price got down around that general vicinity.
BULL11|And to be fair and give credit where credits do it did indeed hold strong.
NEUT12|So $0.21 is more like you said.
NEUT13|Going to be accurate level of you know the pattern, but the pattern itself hasn't really fun, hasn't really changed, it's still a sideways channel pattern.
NEUT14|Yes, I realize will play.
NEUT15|Of course it's changed, it just got wider and that's more than that's more than valid.
NEUT16|But like I said, just from the essence, meaning the price is still just going sideways essentially.
BEAR17|You know that's what's going on here, so it lags.
NEUT18|I don't mean to be anti climatic, I just know that.
NEUT19|There's a lot of people on it, but and I don't say this in a bearish way or bullish way just in the sense of.
NEUT20|Yeah, nothing is really happened at the price, just continues to chop back and forth.
NEUT21|But the level that a lot of people will be watching, especially those breakout players, is going to be right up there at the 26 cent mark.
NEUT22|And then you know the people that are more bearish of things are going to be very curious about that.
NEUT23|21 Cent Mark will continue to watch this sideways channel and let's see what happens with that.
NEUT24|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT25|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event.
NEUT26|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL27|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT28|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT29|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
BEAR30|But in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT31|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT32|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT33|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT34|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT35|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.

NEUT37|So you can get the date and time and claim your spot, which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
