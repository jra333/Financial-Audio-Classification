NEUT0|"""How would you characterize economic performance right now?"
NEUT1|Is is the economy good and how much credit does President Trump deserve for how the economy is doing?
BULL2|The economy is pretty good.
BULL3|In fact, I mean you know it looks like we're close to full employment, although we don't know why wages aren't rising more, I think Trump gets.
NEUT4|Essentially zero no, but no, even under.
NEUT5|First of all, there's been no actual policy is right.
NEUT6|There hasn't really been any policy change, and and you know the convention.
NEUT7|Usually when people try to assess the economic impact of administrations is to assume that the first year is reflects the policies of the previous administration.
NEUT8|So no, there's nothing nothing that is Trumpian about what's going on.
NEUT9|Is there any possibility of sort of a self fulfilling prophecy of economic improvement under Trump, which is to say immediately after he was elected?
BULL10|There was a big improvement.
BEAR11|In consumer sentiment, all from Republicans who thought that the economy was terrible, and then it turned around.
BULL12|And because Trump was going to be president, they thought things would be really good.
NEUT13|Could could that be manifesting, as you know, more consumption, more business investment?
BULL14|You know, just just because people feel confident in Trump's performance that that could be something that itself causes the economy to improve.
BEAR15|Well, The thing is, the economy has been adding jobs at a steady rate for years.
NEUT16|Now you can't see if anything at the rate of job.
BEAR17|The rate of increase is leveling off the curve is bending downwards.
NEUT18|You can't see any Trump effect in there and look these issues are self fulfilling, confidential loss of confidence.
NEUT19|That's a big deal when the unemployment is 10%, then the economy's performance is crucially dependent upon having enough spending out there where we are now.
NEUT20|You know consumers get a lot more confident in the economy, starts to grow faster, the Fed will raise rates faster, so it's kind of we're not in that kind of universe anymore.
NEUT21|"That's a 2010 story, not a 2017 story."""
