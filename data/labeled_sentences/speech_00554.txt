NEUT0|"""Hello there, my name is Nasir."
NEUT1|My Capstone project is.
NEUT2|About predicting stock prices.
NEUT3|Stock trading is one of the most fascinating things I have ventured into.
NEUT4|I'm my life.
NEUT5|I've been an active trader for the past two more past.
NEUT6|One year I have read about 10 books in the field.
NEUT7|So I'm really fascinated about the topic.
NEUT8|As for the project.
NEUT9|I'd like to use historical data so that I could predict future stock movement.
BULL10|How that's going to help me or anyone out there describe trading or investing in the market is that once you have a competitive edge in the market, using historic data to predict future prices, you would be able to have a better trading strategy and hopefully make more money in the market.
NEUT11|The data that I'm going to be using in my project is derived from two sources, the Quad One library that could be installed.
NEUT12|Python And also from Yahoo Finance.
NEUT13|They give you direct access to all financial data and stock market data.
NEUT14|For now I'm using both of them just to see the quality of data on each, but as the project progresses I will most likely stick to one depending on the quality of the data.
NEUT15|Initially in my project I will do some explorator analysis using pandas and matplotlib to visualize the data.
NEUT16|Anne.
NEUT17|Once I have done that, I will progress to the next step of the project where I will train and test the model.
NEUT18|And the Mount models that I'm going to be using other following L STM decision tree regressor and linear regression.
NEUT19|Once I have those problems algorithms set up, I will see the results comparing contrast to see which one gives me the most accuracy.
NEUT20|That I have worked on so far.
NEUT21|As you can see, I initially I installed the libraries.
NEUT22|This is the Quad One library that I initially installed and then using the Quad One Library I I got the data from.
NEUT23|Off about the stock prices.
NEUT24|And.
NEUT25|As you can see, the data here is for Tesla and then I also mentioned about Yahoo data.
NEUT26|I can directly access the data from Yahoo Finance.
NEUT27|As you can see in this section.
NEUT28|This is the data that has been derived from Yahoo.
NEUT29|And.
NEUT30|This is where I try to visualize the data.
NEUT31|You know using that called deep.
NEUT32|And this is where I make the data ready so I can apply some machine learning, train the data you know feature.
NEUT33|Extraction and then.
NEUT34|I tried to apply machine learning.
BULL35|This is as far as I've reached so far to train the LSD M model.
NEUT36|Obviously there is more work to be done.
NEUT37|"And my eventual goal is to apply the SDM model and also applied the decision tree regressor and linear regression as the project progresses."""
