NEUT0|"""If you want to know what the world will look like in six months, not the next few months."
NEUT1|Like I said at the top, just look at the casino stocks right now right now.
NEUT2|The two biggest stories in the business world or the arrival of vaccine, allowing the whole world to go back to normal and the arrival of the new president who will take a less hostile approach to China.
NEUT3|We know the markets already betting big on these stories because there's one group that embodies both of them.
BEAR4|That's the casino stocks with exposure to Macau, the Chinese gambling haven and those stocks are on fire.
NEUT5|When you see these charts, it will blow you away once again, people and once in a people are vaccinated.
NEUT6|Once we're all the herd immunity kind of thing.
NEUT7|Economy does go back to normal travel resumes and people start gambling in person.
BEAR8|Again, and that's why the consumer should have a huge year in 2021 now they had absolutely terrible.
BEAR9|You're terrible numbers lately.
BULL10|Woo, which means they'll be up against some easy comparisons once we get closer to herd immunity and the pent up demand is absolutely enormous.
BEAR11|We've got an entire country going stir crazy that desperately needs a vacation.
NEUT12|Vegas here we come.
NEUT13|Remember the hangover?
NEUT14|That's my prediction for the second half of 2021 is funny movie.
BULL15|Just as important though, you have to believe the American casino operators in Macau will get a boost when the White House becomes less antagonistic to the PRC.
BULL16|Hey, that's a great setting for the hangover for even if Biden takes a harder line then we expect he'll handle the tough negotiations in private, so the Chinese Communist Party doesn't lose face when it makes concessions and it will make concessions.
NEUT17|Personally, I think Trump's trade war was the right move.
BEAR18|The People's Republic has been breaking the rules delivery, howling out US manufacturing for decades, but Wall Street hated the trade war every step of the way.
BEAR19|Some money managers are giddy that Biden is going to lower the temperature, and that's another reason why the casino stocks have been flying.
