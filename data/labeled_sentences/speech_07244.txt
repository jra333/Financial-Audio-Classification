BULL0|"""Hello everyone, welcome to the Analytics Mastery Club."
NEUT1|In last session we learned about how sales managers can forecast future sales.
NEUT2|The objective of this session is to learn how managers can analyze sales loss due to stock out of brands in particular area stock of the brand can be analyzed using two key metrics.
NEUT3|Firstly numeric distribution out of stock person and weighted distribution out of stock person.
NEUT4|Numeric distribution out of stock person.
NEUT5|This matrix signifies percentage number of stores where brand is out of stock.
NEUT6|The formula for numeric distribution out of stock person is number of stores were brand is out of stock by total category stores.
BEAR7|Suppose manager is analyzing stock of Samsung Mobile and he found that in particular area there are 100 mobile stores and out of those hundred shops Samsung Mobile is out of stock in 40 stores.
NEUT8|Thus numeric distribution out of stock person is equal to 40%.
NEUT9|Moving on the applications of numeric distribution out of stock person.
NEUT10|Are as follows.
NEUT11|This matrix has two important questions.
BEAR12|Firstly, am I losing sales because of my non presence in the store where I service?
NEUT13|And Secondly where are the other brands standing in terms of them going out of stock?
NEUT14|Moving on weighted distribution out of stock person.
BEAR15|This analysis helps in understanding loss of sales value in store where brand is out of stock.
NEUT16|Formula for weighted distribution out of stock is category sales from store where brand is out of stock by total category sales.
BEAR17|For example, Samsung Mobile is out of stock in 40 stores out of 100 mobile stores and those stores contribute to sales of Rupees 10.
NEUT18|Lack out of total sales of mobile in 100 stores and total sales value of Mobile's in hundreds to is rupees 40 lacs.
NEUT19|Then in this case, category sales from where brand?
BEAR20|Samsung is out of stock is rupees Stanlake.
NEUT21|Total category sales of mobile in 100 stores is 40 lacs.
NEUT22|Thus weighted distribution out of stock person is 25%.
NEUT23|Moving on the applications of weighted distribution out of stock person are as follows.
NEUT24|This matrix answers to important questions.
BEAR25|Firstly, am I losing opportunity by being out of stock in high throughput stores and Secondly, in which market do I need to increase frequency of servicing?
NEUT26|Thus we can say that Samsung has 40% numeric distribution out of stock percent and 25% weighted distribution out of stock person in particular area.
NEUT27|Thus, we end our session here.
NEUT28|In this session we learned how managers can minimize impact of sales loss using two key metrics.
NEUT29|In next session we will learn vehicle routing problem analysis.
