BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to the note in the news."
BEAR1|Unfortunately for today is that the S&P after a bad day is actually in negative territory for the year.
BEAR2|Looks as though the whole first quarter may be negative.
NEUT3|After all, that's not true of many of the other developed markets of the world.
NEUT4|Even rent measured in dollars.
BEAR5|The main reason the US is suffering is that there is growing concern about whether the US really is going to grow as much as hoped.
BULL6|We plainly had great optimism entering the year.
NEUT7|We have GDP data coming tomorrow which will be interesting and then obviously it will be a very important test coming up very shortly on from in the form of the first quarter earnings season that could determine whether this truly turns into a full blown correction in the US stock market.
BULL8|Meanwhile, for today I'd like to talk about the emerging markets we've had quite a reprieve for them in the last week since Janet Yellen pushed back market expectations as to win.
NEUT9|Rates will rise.
NEUT10|Plainly.
NEUT11|Emerging markets are very sensitive to that first rate rise, and as you can also see essentially this chart, which compares the book multiples of developed market emerging market stocks.
BULL12|The are as cheap as they have been relative to the developed markets in some 12 years.
NEUT13|They really ought to be some value there.
NEUT14|The question is exactly how much risk is there out there to create that value?
BULL15|Well in some.
NEUT16|Countries we've had almost two years now since the taper tantrum of 2013 first started putting emerging markets the best.
NEUT17|In some countries, it looks that there is still quite a lot of risk.
NEUT18|These are the two big economies that the market is really worried about.
NEUT19|Russia and Brazil and we all have a good grasp of way Russia is causing concern.
BEAR20|I would submit that it's really quite alarming that Brazil on this analysis has seen almost as much of its appreciation as Russia.
BULL21|Also note that it's got a particularly.
BEAR22|High proportion of U.S. dollar denominated debt still that could hurt it quite a bit.
BULL23|Also note that it's very prone to commodities just bounced in the last few days, but in general looking to be in a down cycle now, emerging markets as a whole look to be reasonably priced, particularly over a reasonably long time period.
BEAR24|There are still reasons for concern about some of the biggest emerging markets.
NEUT25|We need to know whether they really can negotiate the next 9 or 12 months without a crisis, and to some extent.
NEUT26|If rates are held back rate rises are held back in the US, but that's because the US economy isn't growing.
BEAR27|That might not help very much either.
NEUT28|So yes, emerging markets are cheap.
BULL29|Yes, they've had a reprieve in the last week.
BEAR30|"There are still reasons for concern about some of the biggest emerging markets, particularly Brazil."""
