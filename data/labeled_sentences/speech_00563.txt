NEUT0|"""Market makers that you are."
NEUT1|Let's make sure that all microphones are mute as I go through this left albow.
NEUT2|And why that left Elbow is a left elbow to the new NMT market makers.
NEUT3|We are famous for this left elbow.
NEUT4|And what is a left elbow?
NEUT5|The Left elbow is that closing to that gap down and we moved from 606 fifty two on the Lowe's 606.
NEUT6|Fifty two left elbow.
NEUT7|It burned with the by we are in it.
BEAR8|And we burned $12.00 upper that left elbow down.
NEUT9|What we will do in empties if you stay elevated in your IR and you stay elevated in the current trend ratio.
NEUT10|That means when you pull back like yesterday, you would go higher.
NEUT11|And that the key of the strength of the move will be based on the elevated current ratio.
BULL12|.5 vote .67 was the high of the day.
NEUT13|And we got a Santa back up there, but when we stay elevated here and we stay elevated here on the pull back part of the day, then they bounce.
NEUT14|It's not like you're going from zero here.
NEUT15|And then back to 25 and roll over Beethoven for short, no.
NEUT16|That's the strength.
NEUT17|The.
NEUT18|Call side of the market.
BULL19|Is doing quite well.
NEUT20|This is that $610 call.
BEAR21|That's up 2.41 and the highest 19 and the lowest 1328.
NEUT22|So during the time that we burned on that you could burn that entry, you can burn that entry.
NEUT23|What that left elbow.
NEUT24|At a $12.00 run 1328.
NEUT25|Seventeen, 50 words and we had some people that trades for two contracts traded at that 6:10 call.
NEUT26|When you get left Elbow and you burn you bye.
NEUT27|And you keep burning.
NEUT28|And that's a $12.00 move.
NEUT29|Once again, it's all about that wholesale bid.
NEUT30|At bat left elbow to the wholesale bid.
NEUT31|And the entry and the profits and the exits that the MNTS glorify as a market maker in the option pit, right along with their in empty market maker platform.
NEUT32|And we're going to watch here.
NEUT33|The elevation throughout the day and the time stamp time is 125 2011 7:00 o'clock AM.
NEUT34|We got a 30 minute price action.
NEUT35|Involved with the options on Google.
NEUT36|"Yep."""
