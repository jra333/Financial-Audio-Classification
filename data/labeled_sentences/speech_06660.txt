NEUT0|"""Hello and welcome to another technical analysis here at xm.com."
BULL1|Today we're looking at USD CAD on the daily chart so zooming in or we can see that the loonies recent push up from the one point 2950 low looks to be kept by the 50 and 100 days simple moving averages with sellers pushing back down.
BEAR2|Aiding the negative picture is the restrictive trendline and all their cimaise Witcher sloping downwards.
BEAR3|That said, for now reflecting conflicting signals are the short term oscillators that suggest positive momentum is present with the Smas limiting upside corrections.
BEAR4|If sellers succeeding, propelling the price, lower initial support comes from the 1.31 zero four level steering downwards.
BEAR5|The one point 3041 two and one point 3015 lows from 29th of October and 12th of July 2019 respectively.
BEAR6|Could prevent the bears from reaching the one point 2950 freshed rough if buying interest picks up immediately restricting the pairs.
NEUT7|Ascent is the 50 day SMAP at one point 3148 and the nearby high of one point 3181.
BEAR8|Coupled with the 100 day SMAD clearing this obstacle, the 200 day MA at one point 3230 could impede the climb, with the limiting trendline and the one point 3270 swing.
BEAR9|High overhead challenging buyers efforts to conquer this region.
BEAR10|Overcoming this, the one point 3327 to one point 3343 area of tops made in either one point 5382 peak from being reached.
BULL11|In brief, the short term bias may sustain its bearish nature if it remains below the 50 and 100 day Smas and preventive trendline with a break below one point 2950, boosting the downside move.
NEUT12|That's it for me.
BULL13|"Have a great training day."""
