NEUT0|"""Hey, I'm dan.fitzpatrick@stockmarketmentor.com and I want to look at Netflix."
NEUT1|Here's why this is only going to take a second because we're trading this puppy live tomorrow.
NEUT2|We're getting online at 9:00 o'clock eastern 6:00 o'clock Pacific for the specific purpose of trading Netflix.
NEUT3|So I want you to be there if you're if you remember, just show up.
NEUT4|You'll have the link if you're not a Member, I suggest joining because here's the thing.
NEUT5|I want to make you money so only reason we're doing this.
NEUT6|There's going to be a lot of teaching involved.
NEUT7|I get that there always is.
NEUT8|However, I'm really focused on making money and we're going to look at VWAP pivot points, implied moves, all of that stuff.
NEUT9|And as I was working on some other things, we're actually doing a webinar with Bridget.
BULL10|Definitely.
NEUT11|By the time you're watching this video.
NEUT12|But this is what's happened with the stock.
BEAR13|It's going a little bonkers going a little bonkers after hours after they reported.
BULL14|According to the people on our website, they had strong revenues and earnings.
NEUT15|You know, in line, but they didn't crush.
BULL16|They gave strong guidance.
NEUT17|So all of that's well and good.
NEUT18|But here's my sense right off the bat.
NEUT19|My bet is this could.
BULL20|I'm hoping that it gaps up here because this could turn out to be a good short.
NEUT21|Tomorrow I have no way of knowing that, and there's one thing that's for sure.
NEUT22|The trend is your friend.
NEUT23|The trend is in uptrend, but we're not thinking about that tomorrow were thinking.
NEUT24|Were thinking about day trading, so anyway look, that's all I got were actually starting the web and are you might hear it in the back in the background here.
NEUT25|So I gotta run but I want you in on this tomorrow morning.
NEUT26|"OK alright, I'll see you then."""
