NEUT0|"""However, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
BULL1|We can see Apple has.
NEUT2|Jump a lot, but then.
BEAR3|Dropped down and close at nearly 0.6% for the day.
NEUT4|If we change the chart into daily chart we can see here we got another shooting star pattern.
BEAR5|This pattern tells us there's a lot of selling pressure outside and not a big momentum for the operation.
BEAR6|And also after the dodgy it has made.
NEUT7|Two days ago today we got a small green candle.
BEAR8|It shows the weakness of the stock with very low volume.
NEUT9|So in my opinion should be careful here.
NEUT10|"It's very likely for it to pull back to test spotting all the yummy thank you."""
