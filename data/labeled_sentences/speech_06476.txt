NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Friday, March 3rd on Selena Nicklas technical analyst at exam.com, and today will look at the Australian dollar versus U.S. dollar on the daily chart.
BEAR2|So all the dollar continues its fall as it hit a one month low in today's trading so far yesterday.
BEAR3|It declined by one point.
BEAR4|35% was quite a big drop below the key level of .76.
BEAR5|As regards the short term outlook, the RSI indicator is below 50 in bearish territory now, so it's it's signaling that there is a bearish bias right now.
NEUT6|On the upside, if we look at prices.
BULL7|A range of prices around the key point 76 handle have proved to be key levels in the recent past, acting either as resistance or support.
NEUT8|So this is a very key level going forward, acting as a resistance now.
NEUT9|Now this level at .76 is also Fibonacci level, it's a 23.6% retracement of the December 23rd to February 23rd.
NEUT10|Uptrend and this level comes in.
NEUT11|Just above point 7670, Point 7602.
NEUT12|Now, should this error be cleared?
BULL13|There's another key area recently around point 7615.
NEUT14|This would act as another resistance level.
NEUT15|In the past it acted as support.
NEUT16|If we look to the downside should prices continue lower.
BULL17|We have important support coming up.
NEUT18|It's actually provided by the convergence of the.
NEUT19|200 day moving average with the 50 day moving average along the Fibonacci level, the 38.2% Fibonacci that and this level comes in at point 7525, so this will be an important support area.
NEUT20|Now below this we have the 50% fib annachi that would come into focus at around point 7449.
BEAR21|If we look at the medium term picture, can see there was a bearish cross of the 50 day moving average with the 200 day that gave a bearish signal.
BULL22|But then the market moved above both moving averages.
BEAR23|However, the shot fall in price lately in combination with the convergence of the two moving averages is setting a more or less neutral outlook for the medium term.
NEUT24|But of course the immediate bias now is to the downside.
BULL25|Thank you so much for watching.
BULL26|"Have a great day."""
