NEUT0|"""Going on everybody, my name is Mike."
NEUT1|This is Wall Street traders where we breakdown hot running socks put you at advantage on the market, right guys?
NEUT2|So today's ticker symbol that we're breaking down is AMZN or Amazon.
NEUT3|The market just opened.
NEUT4|You guys I'm going to put this out as fast as possible so you guys can go ahead and check it out.
NEUT5|Have my lines and graphs already set to make this a little bit faster.
NEUT6|So let's go ahead and dive in with where we're at right now.
NEUT7|So we opened up around $3225.
BEAR8|Currently we're hitting major resistance.
NEUT9|You guys.
NEUT10|If you can look to the previous days.
NEUT11|Like I said, I am on the daily timeframe so this is a lot of a lot of green candle sticks to have on a daily time frame with no minor pullback or 50% retracement.
BULL12|So we would like to see a 50 percent, 50% retracement to continue this uptrend because as of right now it is overextended.
NEUT13|You guys getting into this right now would be in a very very aggressive trade.
NEUT14|Obviously if you were to get it right now like I said, have your entry above the 3253 level and then obviously your stop loss.
NEUT15|Below this you guys.
NEUT16|If you're a safer trader, what I would personally do is wait for a further confirmation that we're continuing this trend.
NEUT17|I want to be able to see that buyers are still in control, So what we want to see since we're hitting minor resistance if we look to our left guys, we have all these tops over here hitting into this level.
NEUT18|Obviously this top line represents our major resistance level or a highest point and then down here.
NEUT19|This level is our major support level that's been tested at our lowest point, so let me go ahead and zoom out just a little bit so you guys can see the overall direction.
NEUT20|So this is currently like the channel that we're in.
BEAR21|We're hitting this minor resistance up over here.
NEUT22|If we looked left like Beyonc√© says, we have all this choppiness around in this level.
NEUT23|So what we're going to want to see you guys?
NEUT24|This is just that a cool off to take a break, you guys.
NEUT25|We wanted to come back down and pull back into the 3155 level and then continuous trend higher.
NEUT26|So if we do get a breakout above this level, obviously set your first target back up here and then your stop loss below here.
NEUT27|If you're going to be waiting for a safer entry, may put another line up over here.
BEAR28|We want this to pull back about 50%, so that's going to be the 3157 area.
NEUT29|We want this to pull back down here.
NEUT30|Come up ride this minor resistance and then finally create a breakout just as of right now, I wouldn't get in personally because it is overextended.
NEUT31|We've been pumping for days, you guys, if I were to break this down to the 30 minute you would see that we have in but nothing but pumping and pumping and pumping with no type of retracement or break.
NEUT32|So as of right now like I said, if you're an aggressive trader, you can get in.
NEUT33|Just have your stop loss below this level.
NEUT34|So I would personally wait till we pulled back a little bit until we get a further confirmation that buyers are stepping up.
NEUT35|If you guys like the videos that I make just fast and quick to kind of explain to you where we're at on these charts, put some stocks below an I will break them down for you.
NEUT36|And of course you guys hit that.
