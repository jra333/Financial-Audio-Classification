BULL0|"""No first, on CS we did expect an update today and we got some firm numbers behind that."
NEUT1|Well, I'd look.
BEAR2|This is devastating, but the losses they took versus everybody else.
NEUT3|I know that the risk control chief has been traded, but I think the whole management skill, I mean, this is one of those things, just unforgivable if you don't know how to handle a busted client, then you shouldn't be handling anyone.
BEAR4|And this is just a really dark day for Credit Suisse and I can't.
NEUT5|I can't emphasize this enough.
NEUT6|A lot of companies dealt with this firm, JP Morgan said.
NEUT7|We don't want to deal with these guys.
NEUT8|They did.
BEAR9|They question the character, which I think is absolutely right.
NEUT10|Goldman David Solomon.
BULL11|They managed to get out very very fast.
NEUT12|Morgan Stanley got very, very fast.
BEAR13|We're still still dealing with Credit Suisse selling things so.
NEUT14|Wow, this is remarkable an I think that Credit Suisse has to completely re-evaluate itself, and I think the I think the regulators have to re about evaluate them.
NEUT15|I'm not sure they know what they're doing.
BEAR16|Alright, we'll talk about it a little bit more with David, but Jim yeah, after a few block trades yesterday on some familiar names, suspending the buyback dividend cut by 2/3 will talk a lot more about CS, which by the way they say they have substantially reduced the vast bulk of its exposure, but not all to archegos.
NEUT17|Really, Carla yeah, I was doing some work on one Farfetch and I kept thinking this is a far fetched event.
NEUT18|Well one of their stocks that they got hung with and they were home.
NEUT19|There's a way to deal with this.
NEUT20|You get rid of it so quickly that your head should spin.
NEUT21|But no these guys.
NEUT22|I don't know what they're doing.
NEUT23|I still don't know what they're doing.
NEUT24|They don't know what they're doing.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT26|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
