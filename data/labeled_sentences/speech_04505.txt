NEUT0|"""We need to consider how vulnerable these companies are every single quarter."
NEUT1|So let's delve into them in light of tonight's earnings reports.
NEUT2|Even though I think that they weren't that significant except for one company alphabet, the parent of Google was someone company that did something very unusual.
BULL3|They delivered a huge top and bottom line beat, and that sent the stock soaring much stronger than expected.
NEUT4|Advertising business, real strength in the Google Cloud, which they're breaking out the valuation of.
NEUT5|I always expect output to somehow dropped the ball and scare people, but they didn't.
NEUT6|This time, they didn't happen.
BULL7|YouTube looks great.
NEUT8|This is as of today a new alphabet.
NEUT9|Hey, listen was up the least of all these.
NEUT10|As for Amazon, they obliterated the estimates of what do you even say about a company that earned more than 12 bucks per share?
BULL11|Wall Street was looking for $7.48, a much higher than expected sales.
BEAR12|It's ludicrous to see the stock go down by 37% year over year.
BEAR13|The only blemish while the guidance for the next quarter strong their operating income forecast was a little bit light, which is why the stock got dinged a bit after.
NEUT14|You know what there was this thing.
NEUT15|It was called Kovid.
NEUT16|It cost him like like $4 billion.
NEUT17|I mean, don't you when you have all those employees, don't you think you have more expenses from Kovid?
NEUT18|Thank you Facebook.
BULL19|Another huge top and bottom line beat 22% revenue growth.
NEUT20|If you thought the boycott would hurt them, think again.
NEUT21|Looks like their advertising business on fire.
NEUT22|I love it.
NEUT23|I love Instagram shops.
BULL24|What they're doing for small business CEO David Winter says that we should expect even faster growth next quarter.
BULL25|Although there might be some headwinds in 2021.
NEUT26|For now, though, Facebook's looking really good and what they're doing for the small businessman is never talked about it.
NEUT27|It's pretty phenomenal, OK?
NEUT28|So how about this one is this?
NEUT29|Is this the worm in the Apple way like that now?
NEUT30|Finally, there is what we have behind me.
BEAR31|OK, Apple is getting hit in after hours despite reporting a solid top and bottom line beat.
BEAR32|iPhone sales were weak, but you've got to keep in mind that this was the last quarter before.
NEUT33|Maybe their most important iteration comes out.
NEUT34|The 12 were different models.
NEUT35|All the carriers are subsidizing them aggressively.
BULL36|5G now, based in the first five days of shipping data, CEO Tim Cook is feeling optimistic.
NEUT37|Apple is launching Description button on Friday.
BEAR38|We know this service business is on fire.
NEUT39|585 million subscribers across the company's various platforms.
BULL40|I think the pullback here is a buying opportunity, especially with the 5G launch and the fact that the company didn't skip a beat even though they didn't have a new phone.
BULL41|That's amazing and the services business that is growing like a weed, they can do it.
NEUT42|These guys, the world's are oyster now.
NEUT43|Oh they didn't give guidance.
NEUT44|Oh yeah.
NEUT45|Well then why don't you get me in a party geologist?
NEUT46|They know more.
NEUT47|I mean I got a professor there, assault UCSD that knows more than with Tim Cook.
NEUT48|Possibly say.
NEUT49|Because it's about covid.
NEUT50|Why give a forecast?
NEUT51|Mean less Tim's taking any of the myologie at night or something.
NEUT52|OK, here's the bottom line.
BEAR53|After hearing from nearly all the big tech names, the idea that these stocks are somehow ridiculously expensive and dangerous to me, that's insane in most cases that your investments were way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way too low.
NEUT54|That's exactly what you'd expect from the best of breed companies that are growing into their enormous market capitalizations.
