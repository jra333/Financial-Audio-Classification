NEUT0|"""This time, after the Viper report, this is a brief intro into part of my presentation for the upcoming Wealth 365 conference about my favorite chart formations."
NEUT1|It will also utilize some of the indicators that many of you may know.
NEUT2|Is a chart of the Invesco QQQ Trust in the going into the summer of 2017.
NEUT3|And actually I follow this pattern in my publications.
NEUT4|At the time we had a really nice move to the upside here we formed a doji here and the next day we had a dodgy cell signal.
NEUT5|And which suggested this market was topping out a little bit, went sideways for a couple of days.
BEAR6|Big day down.
NEUT7|You know that well below the stark bands next day.
NEUT8|Also below the stark bands.
BEAR9|We had a rebound back to the moving average and then another push down back to those lows.
NEUT10|So what was the interpretation at that point?
NEUT11|Well, first of all, you have to look below.
BEAR12|There you can see the obv turned very negative.
BEAR13|So that was a sign that there was quite heavy selling on this decline and that the client was likely to continue.
BULL14|If you look at the FIB levels from this low to this high, you'll see we exceeded the 38.2% support, which was at one 3442.
BEAR15|The low here was at one 3357.
BULL16|So that also favored a bounce from here, but as you can see the obv, and frankly the other technical studies were way a long ways from turning positive.
BULL17|We did get quite a nice rally that lasted a little over a week.
BULL18|Took us back above 138 right back up into this resistance.
NEUT19|But then at that point was a good shorting opportunity in my opinion.
NEUT20|And there are number of ways you can.
NEUT21|Analyze what the potential downside targets are.
NEUT22|One that often works quite well is to look at the.
BEAR23|How far prices dropped on the initial decline, which was just over 6 points.
NEUT24|If you take 6 points and subtract it from this high, which was one 3861, you get one 3221 and see that also comes right into the 50% support level.
NEUT25|That means if you're buying puts up in here, you probably look for a strike price one 34132.
NEUT26|Or if you want to be really bearish, 1:30.
BEAR27|It turns out the lowest one 3229.
BULL28|And drawing in some trendlines and see we appeared to have completed a nice little flag formation.
BULL29|He obv is improving as we got down to that downside target.
NEUT30|We go ahead a couple of bars.
BULL31|You can see we've got one more push to the downside.
NEUT32|And then we started to turn higher.
NEUT33|So in the next part.
NEUT34|I'll give you another way.
NEUT35|You can determine why a top was in place here, and the downside targets as well as look at the potential upside targets.
BEAR36|If this was indeed just a correction in an overall uptrend.
BULL37|So I hope you'll be able to join me in April.
NEUT38|Please mark down the dates April 19th to the 24th and as we get closer I'll have a specific time.
NEUT39|And day for my presentation.
NEUT40|Those who signed up with us will be also invited to a post presentation session where I'll look at some further examples of this.
NEUT41|Methodology and also be able to answer your questions.
BULL42|Hope you can join us.
BULL43|Thank you very much.
