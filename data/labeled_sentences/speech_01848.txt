NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol CAPR."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Did this analysis several times last week, so let us wear the green and red line annotation are coming from here and this will be the last video I do for the foreseeable future on this one.
NEUT5|Just because there's not much I can really say from an overall chart perspective until something happens Now, what do I mean by something happens?
NEUT6|Well, that's relative to the overall pattern that's taking shape as I've talked about in past videos.
NEUT7|And that's just a sideways channel right here between this green and red line.
NEUT8|You can see the price has just continued to bounce back and forth, so until something happens in regards to that pattern meaning.
NEUT9|A break out to the upside or.
NEUT10|A breakdown of the downside.
NEUT11|Then there's not much that you know I can report now.
NEUT12|If you're some sort of day trader or flipper scalper everyone herself, then yeah, in here you can just be flipping back and forth.
NEUT13|Buy, Sell, buy, sell, and all that.
NEUT14|But from the general chart perspective, not much else can be set until either a breakout or breakdown does happen.
NEUT15|So again, just to really kind of summarize things and just throw the levels to watch going forward.
NEUT16|Top of the resistance of our top of the excuse Me channel pattern resistance up here at $8.50.
BEAR17|Bottom of the channel support down there at $6 and those are really going to be the two main levels going forward so not a whole lot to report but not a whole lot of action came in but I do want to just finally comment on the volume you don't want to watch volume and you don't want to have volume stay low for too long or else people are going to lose interest.
NEUT18|Their attention spans are going to other stocks and they were just going to sell for the sake of well I'm stuck in this.
NEUT19|Nothing's happening but I'm looking at that stock over there.
NEUT20|And stuff is happening.
NEUT21|Therefore I want to trade it.
NEUT22|I'm just going to sell and move on and you get enough of that type of attitude and that can be almost a self filling prophecy that will drive it to the downside.
NEUT23|So I'm not saying that's going to for sure happen, I'm just saying that's why you want to monitor volume.
NEUT24|You want to make sure that my volume doesn't stay too low for too long.
NEUT25|'cause then people are like I said, we're just going to move on, so that's the one thing to keep an eye on.
NEUT26|But overall, sideways channel pattern is really the best way to explain the technical chart.
NEUT27|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT28|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT29|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL30|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT31|The first key is super weird.
NEUT32|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT33|But in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT36|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT37|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT39|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
