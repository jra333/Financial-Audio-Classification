NEUT2|Basically has volume of about 125 million, so about a 1.43 volume to market cap ratio.
NEUT3|Anything over one it is always amazing and it shows that there's a lot of attention and interest behind these projects, especially with it being under $100 million.
BEAR4|Market cap shows disconnect.
NEUT5|A potential 10X to 100X.
NEUT6|Putting it around 100 around $10 billion, which isn't even out of the question for a project like this at the top of the ballroom.
