NEUT0|"""When we talk about cryptocurrencies at PayPal, what's in it for the company?"
NEUT1|I mean, is it the fact that maybe the company can extract fees from the conversion of crypto currencies?
NEUT2|Or is it something else?
NEUT3|Yeah, thanks for having me always a pleasure so look, I think the most important thing here for PayPal.
NEUT4|It does two things.
NEUT5|The first thing it boosts engagement so the more often you are actually using the app you're looking at your Bitcoin.
NEUT6|You are paying with your Bitcoin.
NEUT7|You're more spending more time on the app and that's what we call the Super app effect.
NEUT8|So you're going to be using the PayPal app more and more often, and then you're probably going to be getting other stuff, so that's kind of the first step.
NEUT9|The second step is if a lot of people are going to use this, then eventually because PayPal charges the same for the merchant.
NEUT10|But it doesn't have to pay Visa, MasterCard or the banks.
BULL11|It might be able to increase their own margins so it has affected the ripple effect of more usage super app, but also you know margin expansion if people use it and they don't have to pay the interchange etc to the base.
NEUT12|Yeah, so you look at PayPal on this latest news today you look at the news yesterday from Visa, I realized that that's not Bitcoin, it's actually a U.S. dollar pegged coin there.
NEUT13|But in general looking looking around the payments.
NEUT14|Ecosystem right now?
NEUT15|Is it safe to say that we are at an inflection point in terms of greater adoption of cryptocurrencies as an actual store of value?
NEUT16|Use of value?
NEUT17|100% so it's it's become sort of it.
NEUT18|I wouldn't say brings Bitcoin one step closer to becoming mainstream because now it's not just stored value, it's actually value that you could use in a store, right?
NEUT19|So it becomes that that change from stored value.
NEUT20|The value you can use in a store.
NEUT21|That's like the big thing, and you're seeing that in the price of Bitcoin and you have a lot of people that are kind of betting on Bitcoin.
NEUT22|You know we hosted Kathy would a few weeks ago and she's talking about Bitcoin being like pulling up and Dan.
NEUT23|And becoming like mainstream, so I think that that.
BULL24|Prophecies being fulfilled overtime and we're seeing that coming to fruition right now.
NEUT25|So then, in light of this, PayPal Bitcoin news, the impact it likely have on a square and other companies in this space.
BULL26|Is there a chance now that we're actually undervaluing fintech stocks and I'm even saying this as we see squares up about 2% today and is trading at 175 times forward earnings?
NEUT27|Yeah, I would look.
NEUT28|I mean look.
NEUT29|This is a great question, but the more important thing when you look at these these names, PayPal squared payment names, you have to look at the terminal value right there, maximizing the terminal value.
NEUT30|So just looking at what they're going to do next year or two years out from now, you're underestimating.
NEUT31|Kind of the potential future impact.
NEUT32|If I told you, for example, that square is like the JPMorgan up future, then you'd be looking at it in a whole different prism, right?
NEUT33|And you're like, wait, am I buying something now that's, you know?
NEUT34|I think it's valued highly, but like in 10 years they are at the Bank of the future.
NEUT35|There are the money center Bank of the future.
NEUT36|That's like a very very big upside to it.
NEUT37|So I think if you if you believe that these companies are the banks of the future, then I don't think they're overvalued.
BEAR38|They're probably undervalued where they are, and that's why we have like $380 price target on squared.
NEUT39|375 on paper.
NEUT40|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT41|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
