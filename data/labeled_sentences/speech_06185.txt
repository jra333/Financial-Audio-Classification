NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Monster Energy is range between $1.41 per share and $17.66 per share."
NEUT1|How are these values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $1.41 per share represents the company's cash.
NEUT3|So for every share issued and outstanding, they have 141 in cash and cash equivalents.
NEUT4|Paying $17.66 per share represents the company's price per share, based on its earnings now, price of 1766 represents the fractional payment that me or you would have to make assuming an investment.
NEUT5|Which is a payment for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT6|Now this is a conservative way to value the company and it's different from calculating its price to earnings ratio.
NEUT7|Now what are they trading at today?
NEUT8|Monster is currently trading at a price of $83.26 per share, which is much higher than the intrinsic value of $17.66, so we need an alternative.
NEUT9|So if we're not going to invest in Monster Energy Energy, then where do we put our money?
NEUT10|Well, we don't want to leave it in a bank.
NEUT11|So don't do that.
NEUT12|What I would recommend is that you put your money in the Vanguard 500 index fund.
NEUT13|Now the reason I suggest this is because it's the same fund that Warren Buffett used to beat up the hedge fund.
NEUT14|Guys 08 through 18 in a bit.
NEUT15|Now he all he did was just park his money here and the guys thought that the hedge fund guys so that they could, you know, create a larger return through active strategies.
BULL16|But his was a passive one and look at this 10 year trailing guys 10 year trailing return is 12.98% which is excellent.
NEUT17|Huge leaves, enough space for inflation so.
NEUT18|And look at the variance on this trendline.
NEUT19|This curve this very low risk.
NEUT20|So what we would want to do is put our money here until this price per share becomes more reasonable and kind of aligns with the revenues and the profits that these folks are actually generating.
NEUT21|It's just not fair to pay this price.
NEUT22|It's not fair at all, so if you got any value from this video guys, make sure to subscribe to my channel so you can continue to gain insight on how to analyze business performance.
