BEAR0|"""I'm thrilled that we finally have a new federal policy on everything from mass to shots, and hopefully it's going to include these antigen tests at home, but we've been so hobbled by the previous lack of a federal response that it could be difficult to get things rolling, which means a huge chunk of the service sector stays on ice."
NEUT1|But then there's the one bright spot that I like to talk about that other people already saying is too overheated.
NEUT2|I like talking about housing and the Killjoys, who instantly talked about how this great number must be dangerous.
NEUT3|Simply don't know what they're talking about.
NEUT4|A booming housing market?
BULL5|Is good for this economy even if the last one ended horribly doesn't mean that this one has to end horribly.
BULL6|In fact, it could be great.
NEUT7|What makes me so confident that 2021 is to 2006 first, like 2006.
NEUT8|Right now.
NEUT9|The consumers incredibly solve it.
NEUT10|I mean, the most they've ever been.
BEAR11|Frankly, before the financial crisis, we would constantly meant the terrible balance sheet of most American households.
NEUT12|Now it's the opposite.
BEAR13|People are brimming with cash and rapidly paying down that it's actually a major reason why the banks earnings weren't as good as we like.
NEUT14|Second, I know we won't have a repeal repeated the financial crisis, because in the aftermath of the crash.
NEUT15|The government set up new standards that make it much more difficult to get a mortgage.
NEUT16|You can't just go in there with no cash and no docs like in 2006.
NEUT17|These days you need a sizable down payment and documentation, or no dice ask me.
NEUT18|I do a lot in the housing market.
NEUT19|I can't just get a mortgage, it's.
NEUT20|It takes a long time even with DocuSign.
NEUT21|Sure, there are some outliers, but overall we're personally close to having no loan demand because it's so.
NEUT22|It's too risky.
NEUT23|The government doesn't want it.
BEAR24|Plus, I'd argue that buying a home has become more of a necessity for the younger generation because they're tired of living with their parents and they're fleeing the cities and rose thanks to Covid, and many are having families under the same roof.
NEUT25|It's time to go people.
NEUT26|Yet even with all this demand, the price of housing is relatively reasonable.
NEUT27|Last week, Katie Holmes, big Home Builder, gave you a price breakdown.
NEUT28|When they reported a of the areas they sell in to get these numbers 'cause they're not outrageous.
BEAR29|300 forty $4000 for a house in Southwest 312 thousand in Central U.S. tour and 83,000 SE and 640,000 West Coast Mature California expensive, but it's always been expensive and prices are coming down rapidly in some places like San Francisco, that's not inflation.
NEUT30|It's the status quo.
NEUT31|Again, those numbers are big if you have no money.
NEUT32|I know that if you have no job and I feel terrible, but when you look at those numbers that is not inflation.
NEUT33|3rd, what else are people going to be given the severe constraints imposed by covid, where else can you spend your money portion?
NEUT34|For U.S. economy, there are two new forces at work driving spending, remote work, and remote schooling.
NEUT35|We're now going into a hybrid mode for work.
NEUT36|It's become optional whether you go in or not.
NEUT37|However, not working is not an option.
BEAR38|I don't know if you see it, but the people who signed on to the hybrid model are actually working more hours because they just can't Clock out.
