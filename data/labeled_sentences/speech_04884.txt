NEUT0|"""Can we start with the 10 year because it's instance last time we spoke it sticked up semoran we know that what is it?"
NEUT1|The boiling water with the frog?
NEUT2|You know you started out just barely warm and it doesn't even notice.
NEUT3|Is that what we're seeing here and sooner or later we're going to be in boiling water?
NEUT4|So do it.
NEUT5|Turns out according to Adam Grant that that story is wrong, but what we're seeing is something very simple.
NEUT6|The market mood has changed is no longer whether yields are going higher.
NEUT7|But when is a move to big?
NEUT8|That is what the markets trying to figure out and that has three elements.
NEUT9|It's about the economy is about market conditioning and it's about the Fed so far.
BEAR10|So far people think that this move is, well, not welcomed, is fine, but keep an eye on it because the faster we move, the more you're going to destabilize all three of these elements.
NEUT11|That's why I've had it as a risk factor that I've talked to you about for the last two months.
NEUT12|The reasons for it, and it's a combination I guess, and it's it's all related.
NEUT13|I mean, we could be reopening and earlier a guy like Doctor Scott Gottlieb said it's going to be like wood stock.
NEUT14|Which I immediately thought, wow, I mean I remember that was crazy.
NEUT15|I mean, if we were you open or roaring 20s whatever you want to talk about.
NEUT16|But there is some pent up urge to to go, let everybody let their hair down.
NEUT17|You can just feel it Mohammed.
NEUT18|So that might be coming.
BEAR19|But we also got some hot inflation numbers and a resurgent economy and a resurgent consumer might be inflationary.
NEUT20|So they're related.
NEUT21|But is that what the 10 year is sniffing out?
NEUT22|Yeah, it's the second one that we should worry about.
NEUT23|You know there's good reasons for yields to go up.
BEAR24|The first one economic activity, and there's bad reasons inflation and what we seeing interesting Lee is that economists, even those who have long supported a big fiscal push, are saying be careful going big may be too big.
BEAR25|He had only be able on shark over the weekend who joined Larry Summers and saying, look, I've always supported fiscal injections, but this may be too much.
BEAR26|This may result in an output gap.
NEUT27|The multipliers are too high and guess what?
NEUT28|You'll get inflation.
NEUT29|He didn't even mention financial stability risk, so it is the 2nd element that you may destabilize inflation expectation that the markets are really worried about.
NEUT30|Shepard Smith here.
