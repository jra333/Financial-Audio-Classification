NEUT0|"""It is time for our daily Sosies takes today you were looking once again at Macy's is a frequent take target."
NEUT1|I think we can say and the company is doing a management reshuffle.
NEUT2|It sounds like what's a prime.
NEUT3|Yeah, the axe is definitely swing over at Macy's guys, so let me just run the list of humans that are will be departing.
NEUT4|Macy's COCOO, John Harper.
NEUT5|Wave goodbye to him.
NEUT6|He joined the company in January 2020.
NEUT7|He's now waving peace out Next up in Krishna, Krishna.
NEUT8|He's the Chief tech officer.
NEUT9|He joined in June 2018.
NEUT10|He's departing Marla Beck, co-founder of Blue Mercury.
NEUT11|That is the cosmetics brand at Macy's bought for $210 million in 2015.
NEUT12|She's leaving see you later and the last but not least, Doug Sesler.
NEUT13|He has been heading.
BULL14|Off the companies real estate strategy in many respects, I would say he is saved.
BULL15|The company has brought a lot of cash in that business.
NEUT16|He is saying goodbye.
NEUT17|Now I know next we have a another graphic too.
BEAR18|This is just continuous really.
BEAR19|A year and a half of a lot of executive change and turn over the door continues to swing at Macy's and a lot of executives have left the company a couple of changes in the CFO Suite.
NEUT20|New communications chief and I put together a couple reasons why I think this is happening.
NEUT21|Just put these together on the fly right now.
NEUT22|CEO Jeff gennette.
NEUT23|He may just not be good.
BEAR24|At identifying key executive talent, #2 may just not be good at making major quick decisions when executives are not delivering and that clearly it's been the case in Macy's for two years, stock is down close to about 40% over that timeframe.
NEUT25|Next but not least is that it's going to himself.
NEUT26|He's been there since 1983 and you have to wonder if he's part of the problem or part of the solution where he doesn't upset that Macy's story.
NEUT27|Macy's culture that he's been part of for many, many years, and the last but not least.
BEAR28|But maybe the situation at Macy's is just really not good.
NEUT29|Where these executives do not want to be a part of this team and they see other opportunities elsewhere.
BULL30|This company in the past 2 1/2 years has undergone a massive massive restructuring and even coming out of the second coming out of holiday quarter.
NEUT31|There are no indications that that restructuring is going to be done anytime soon.
NEUT32|A lot more store closures are coming down the Pike, and if your executives, why do you want that on your resume?
NEUT33|Does he want anyone from base is going to talk to you?
NEUT34|After all, this is going to bring in someone who says, alright, I'll deal with this guy over at Yahoo Finance, you just trash the company all the time.
NEUT35|I have no comment on that miles I am.
NEUT36|I reporting lead with the numbers.
BULL37|Hi thank you hey.
NEUT38|And so we wait for the for the next tell all from from.
NEUT39|I suppose the next Macy's CEO, because I don't think you can get all the cells that really talked to him.
NEUT40|But you talked about Black Friday a couple years ago.
NEUT41|It seemed like things were fine then.
NEUT42|Yeah again, no comment.
NEUT43|"OK, so we're going to take a break on that note."""
