NEUT0|"""Sarah's in Spokane."
NEUT1|Hey Sarah, welcome to the Dave Ramsey show.
BULL2|Good afternoon, thanks for taking my call.
NEUT3|The reason I'm calling is my husband and I need some help.
NEUT4|My father in law is trying to convince my mom my mother in law to closeout her inherited IRA because he's convinced that the stock market is going to crash.
NEUT5|So I want to know is how can I convince them to keep the money in the RA or should I have them move it?
NEUT6|Trailer, but it's hard to have.
NEUT7|It's hard to convince anyone who is suffering from political paranoia.
NEUT8|To do anything.
NEUT9|Because he's bought off, he's bought off on the idea that Joe Biden is the end of the world.
NEUT10|Right, and you know, every president that has been elected since I've been an adult was going to bring about the end of the world by the people that didn't vote for him.
NEUT11|And none of them did.
BULL12|You know, I yeah I totally agree.
NEUT13|I don't know how you gonna get in his head.
NEUT14|I don't know.
NEUT15|I mean he he is.
NEUT16|He needs to turn off Fox News is we need to do.
NEUT17|And turn off CNN and quit looking on these stupid **** websites.
NEUT18|Because, OK, there's no historical data anywhere to indicate that a single party, no matter how crooked or incompetent president is, has the power to destroy America.
NEUT19|There's no data.
NEUT20|I mean, there's no.
NEUT21|There's no time in history no matter you can find the worst possible presidency in history, and you can argue about what that is and the stock market did OK. Yeah.
NEUT22|So he's wrong.
NEUT23|He's wrong, you know, we can.
NEUT24|We can talk about whether we agree with the fact that he hates Joe Biden, or whether we agree with you.
NEUT25|Know he went down a Trump rabbit hole of some kind.
NEUT26|We could talk about all that as a separate subject if you want, but that's not the point.
NEUT27|The point is, I, regardless of whether I agree with all the crap they're doing up there, I've never agreed with all the crap any of them have done up there.
NEUT28|But I keep investing and I've always invested because the data says the historical data on the stock market says, no matter what moron is in the White House.
BULL29|We still still seem to be able to make money in the Dadgum stock market.
NEUT30|Right?
NEUT31|That's the only thing I could tell her.
NEUT32|That there's no, that's what I keep yeah I would just say that that there is no.
NEUT33|Nothing to indicate that your paranoia is accurate.
BEAR34|OK. And you're going to lose a lot of money.
NEUT35|Let me give you another example.
NEUT36|OK, how about this one?
NEUT37|Covid is going to bring the economy to its knees and it will never get up.
NEUT38|Remember that one.
NEUT39|Ideal and the stock market dove.
BEAR40|Way down in March and April remember?
NEUT41|Ideal, you know what it made last year, almost 16% rate of return from January to January.
BEAR42|And that's in the middle of freaking kovat trying to destroy our lives.
BEAR43|It made 16% last year, so if you freaked out if you had a covid freak out and pulled out your mother market, you missed 16% on your money.
NEUT44|Wow.
NEUT45|"This is the Dave Ramsey show."""
