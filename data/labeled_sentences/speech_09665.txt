NEUT0|"""Bloomberg held its third annual ETF's in depth conference yesterday."
NEUT1|It touched on a lot of hot topics from Bitcoin to factor investing and here to discuss some of the takeaways.

NEUT6|Resign, yeah, yeah from grayscale.
NEUT7|And that is the company that puts out the BTC.
NEUT8|The Bitcoin Investment Trust couple things about this one he was talking about the fact that it's not just some investors private investors, he's having pensions and endowments inquire with this fund.
NEUT9|Now keep in mind this isn't even an ETF, this is an over the counter traded fund.
NEUT10|That's a private trust that trades at a premium, right?
NEUT11|And he also added that it's the trades $400 million a day over the counter.
