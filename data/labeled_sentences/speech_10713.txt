NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol JE."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
BULL3|I do offer an explanation video at that link will automate the obvious, but I will anyways to just build some Contacts, but a very very impressive balance on this Wednesday when you think about the fact that the price opened up down, around here and now, it's been able to battle back up to where it has.
NEUT4|I mean, that's a very very impressive bounds, but that does lead to the valid question of.
NEUT5|But is there any sort of true power behind this woman?
NEUT6|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT7|Dead Cat Bounce, type move and I have no idea.
NEUT8|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward.
NEUT9|In my mind it was on a single area.
BEAR10|In that area is down here at $1.80 wise, $1.80 important.
NEUT11|And I'm not saying that all of this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT12|If the price were to come down here, behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price that would be putting the price quite literally right back to where it was.
NEUT13|And I mean not to insult your intelligence, but price movements that go back to where they were not exactly sign a true power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT14|However, to be fair, nothing can just go straight up, so maybe the price comes down here behaves in that manner then starts to curl upwards.
NEUT15|Now what's the big difference here?
NEUT16|When all of a sudden?
NEUT17|You have a set of those right there.
NEUT18|You look at that set of Lowe's right there, and if you envision each of those, is there steps?
NEUT19|Well, hey there, we go now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction, and that's the name of the game.
BULL20|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is it's going to make progress.
NEUT21|And again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined is right there around that dollar.
NEUT22|80 mark.
NEUT23|Now what about areas of resistance?
NEUT24|Nothing fancy or complicated here.
NEUT25|First level is just simply where the party and momentum stopped today, and that was up there at $2.90.
NEUT26|And then if the pricing clear up through 290, next level would be that Purple line up there.
NEUT27|The 50.
NEUT28|Moving average.
NEUT29|But first, the price can even break up through that 290 mark.
NEUT30|So All in all, very nice bounce today, not just a question of can the price build upon this moving forward.
NEUT31|Let's see what happens.
NEUT32|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT34|But it will be me.
NEUT35|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL36|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT37|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT38|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR39|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT40|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT41|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT42|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT43|That is again totally live.

NEUT45|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
