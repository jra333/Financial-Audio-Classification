NEUT0|"""You know what really grinds my gears?"
NEUT1|EA Sports **** you.
NEUT2|Hello guys, that embryo brand new video and this one is on.
NEUT3|The device would build a challenge that I told you about now.
NEUT4|Obviously the team of the week has been released by Aunt.
NEUT5|Well I'll leave it on screen now.
NEUT6|If you haven't seen that already and as you can see a need to be is not on the team.
NEUT7|Dafoe is now, in my opinion, Dafoe didn't deserve it.
NEUT8|That game and interviewed a lot more in that game and the phone, obviously, guys 150th Golden Prep.
NEUT9|Now I think the photo should have actually gotten better challenge and a lot of people did say that as well.
NEUT10|It's not just because I'm a stand and support.
NEUT11|And I think and it should be, should have got the inform.
NEUT12|Now what this means is maybe in the future they might bring out the foe sort of a challenge.
NEUT13|So that's like, you know, don't knock that idea completely together.
NEUT14|Maybe they're thinking about doing it $200, which would be a very long time away.
NEUT15|It would actually be this before, so bear that in mind to my suggestions for who it could be.
NEUT16|The next one of the challenge could be on and definitely voices up there because of performance.
NEUT17|He had the other day and I'm not really actually quite sure and anyone else who could have a huge sort of reason to get one right now.
NEUT18|Anne.
NEUT19|Voice is definitely one.
NEUT20|I know there's a an award that was given out the other day and, the name of it.
NEUT21|The winner of that could obviously get one and but I'm not really sure who would be a huge contender at the moment.
NEUT22|If you haven't done this video, make sure to drop right down below.
NEUT23|Subscribe if you're new.
NEUT24|"And obviously I will give you some more news on the next orbital challenge when I know."""
