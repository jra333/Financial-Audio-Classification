NEUT0|"""Hello, I'm Sonya Rail with The Motley Fool and I'm joined by Stuart Watson."
NEUT1|Our premium service letter low Stewart, my Sonya, and we're here today to talk about funds versus shares now Stewart.
NEUT2|Most people end up buying funds when they start investing.
NEUT3|Why do you think that is?
NEUT4|Well, there's three reasons I think.
NEUT5|Coming first of all, it's easier to buy a fund and the individual share you don't have to take a view on the company's management.
NEUT6|You don't have to look at it.
NEUT7|Accounts you also get instant diversification of the fund, so when you buy a fund, you're buying dozens, even hundreds of companies, and that gives you a broad mix of sectors.
NEUT8|So if one industry is doing poorly, you might find you invest in another industry, is doing well, and that's all evens itself out.
NEUT9|And Lastly, I think there's a big marketing machine behind these funds, so particularly nice season, which is March April time.
NEUT10|Each year you'll find that there's adverts everywhere for funds and and lots of people buy funds on the back of that.
BEAR11|OK so 7 out of 10 fund fund managers underperform the market.
NEUT12|Why do you think that is?
NEUT13|Yeah, I mean this is a stat which surprises many people when they first come across it.
NEUT14|But if you think about it, it's not actually that unexpected.
NEUT15|So you could say beating the market is an index like the Footsie 100, which is merely the average performance of all shares.
NEUT16|So you could say, well, given that, shouldn't 50% do worse and $0.50 do better?
NEUT17|But then you need to bear costs in mind, so you've got up front costs of say 5% when you buy a fund.
NEUT18|There's an ongoing management charge, which is another one half percent this year, perhaps, and then there's a cost of the manager buying and selling the shares within that fund.
NEUT19|Paying things like stamp duty and stuff like that, and these sound like small amounts, but they will add up year after year.
BEAR20|So when you look at the long term performance of funds and you'll find that 70 or perhaps even more will underperform the market.
NEUT21|OK, so how can private investors outperform the market significantly?
NEUT22|I mean, I keep hearing about these these ten baggers and multi bankers?
NEUT23|Or are they and?
NEUT24|How is your day to find?
BULL25|Well, that empire is simply a company that's gone up 10 times in value from say, Â£1.10 pounds.
NEUT26|They're fairly ram.
NEUT27|We did a report quite recently.
NEUT28|We looked at this.
NEUT29|They looked at the all the companies in the Footsie all share, which about 700 companies and we found about 13 I think, which are 10 bags over the last 10 years.
NEUT30|So only about 2%.
NEUT31|So can you give us some examples?
NEUT32|Yeah, sure, so one would be a couple of Domino's.
NEUT33|Domino's Pizza is very simple to understand business and that's going up about 1617 times in the last 10 years.
NEUT34|So that's one thing that might surprise investors you know.
BULL35|A business like that, you know, just rolling out new branches can produce those multi size gains.
NEUT36|K anymore examples yeah.
BULL37|So resource stocks also done very well, so a gold miner Randgold Resources is up about.
NEUT38|I think 27 times in last 10 years, so that's got a series of mines.
NEUT39|It's built up in in Africa, and oil is another one.
NEUT40|So on the resource side, Sotelo oil also in Africa.
BULL41|It's done very well.
NEUT42|That's up about 12 or 13 times and this is over the last 10 years, the last 10 years.
NEUT43|Yeah, OK so.
NEUT44|Looks like private investors can beat the market significantly, but you just need to look for good companies and look where other investors on.
NEUT45|Yep, that's a good way to summarize it.
NEUT46|I think wonderful.
BULL47|Thank you Stewart.
NEUT48|The tickets that we've discussed today are Domino's DM, Mango Resources or Rs and tallow oil TLW.
BULL49|"Thanks for watching."""
