NEUT0|"""In short, this rotation ends when the economy hits wall and long term interest rates stop going higher, or at least take a breather, which could give you a chance if you get one tomorrow, do a little salary because the 2015 2016 scenario that I keep talking bout will take a little time to play out."
NEUT1|Why?
NEUT2|Because the Fed this time has been adamant that it won't be raising short term rates anytime soon.
NEUT3|That takes away from that Janet Yellen raise, although of course people feel Jay Powell capitulate when we get the big stimulus and get the open.
NEUT4|Now once we get a cathartic collapse of epic proportions as some people think will happen in a single day.
NEUT5|That's what we call a whoosh down instead of this drip drip drip.
NEUT6|Then you can swap back from the boom and bust stocks to the consistent growers.
NEUT7|Let me put it like this.
NEUT8|We've never really seen a run like this and travel and leisure the industrials quickly.
BEAR9|Travel leisure 'cause we have of course been closed down for full year, but we've absolutely seen sell offs like this in the high multiple textbox quite often, and they tend not to crescendo to a bottom until we have rate hikes.
BEAR10|A slowing economy and some high profile blowups.
NEUT11|None of these is likely anytime soon though, although you can certainly expect some balances along the way.
BULL12|As rates never go up in a straight line, these companies are doing so well that there will come a time when the selling abates a bit and you get a knee jerk rebound as you did several times in late 2015.
NEUT13|An before the big whoosh down that you got in February.
NEUT14|There were many times to sell.
NEUT15|Maybe you avail yourself up and do you sell all the things TACAN swap into planes, trains, automobiles, industrials?
NEUT16|Not to mention the newly red hot oils.
NEUT17|You know.
NEUT18|I like Chevron and Pioneer every night.
NEUT19|They're the only 200 men.
NEUT20|Frankly, if you're nimble enough, that's OK.
BULL21|I'm game, you're up a lot.
BEAR22|We've been scaling back on the techniques for my Chapel trust for weeks now.
NEUT23|Replace them with industrials, because that's what you do at this point of the cycle, but if you can't be nimble if you're not confident you can swap back into tech at some lower level that's close to the bottom, then don't try to dump your whole position.
NEUT24|Scale back when your favorite tech stocks so you can buy more at lower levels, you'll have room, and this is something to be telling people in my actionalertsplus.com club call tomorrow, 11:30 scale back.
NEUT25|You'll have room bottom line, I know it's tough to just stand there and take punches, isn't it awful?
BULL26|I think he's well run companies that have thrived during the pandemic.
NEUT27|They always come back.
BULL28|But their stocks won't start rebounding until the Fed tightens.
NEUT29|The economy slows for some other reason, and that could be a long way away if the economy reopens on schedule and we get a stimulus package.
NEUT30|Of course you know we have.
NEUT31|Here we have your thank God.
NEUT32|Thank God thing that and of course an what really has to happen.
NEUT33|Well, Apple.
BEAR34|In the meantime, we've got a glut of tech stocks and a shortage of cyclicals.
NEUT35|Right now you gotta go with the shortage.
