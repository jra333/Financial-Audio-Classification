NEUT0|"""Bring in Jeffrey Cleveland Jeffrey what what's your reaction to what the President had to say today?"
NEUT1|I know you've been listening.
NEUT2|Go across the board.
NEUT3|What's your reaction?
NEUT4|You you know my response to it, ignore the politics.
NEUT5|Focus on the fundamentals and the fundamentals.
BULL6|Have improved so the global manufacturing data people are paying attention to this, but the last four months we've seen improvement.
BULL7|Global manufacturing PMI is now above 50 for the first time since the spring.
BEAR8|The 50 delineates expansion from contraction, so this scare story of the year has been global weakness.
BEAR9|That is going away.
BULL10|We're seeing we're seeing stabilization in the global backdrop.
BULL11|That I think Stewart will also feed through into US manufacturing as we head into 2020, so this isn't this is a good story about fundamentals that are actually improving right now.
BEAR12|Jeffrey, I do hear you but look the Dow is down 400 points now.
BEAR13|It was down to 50 yesterday and the backdrop to all of this is the possibility of more tariffs on China products come December the 15th taxes on French luxury products and maybe no US MCA.
NEUT14|That's what the markets reacting to and I put it to you Jeffrey.
BEAR15|If those things happen, more tariffs here and there and no US MCA, our economy could hurt.
NEUT16|You know what's amazing?
NEUT17|Stewart is actually the resiliency of the US economy.
BULL18|Even with the tariffs that we've seen an talk of more tariffs, Stewart, we're still seeing 2% growth in the second half year of 2019.
BULL19|I think will have a 2.3% growth figure for the full year, full year 2019.
BEAR20|That is only a little bit slower than what we achieved in 2018.
BULL21|Two and a half percent growth excellent.
NEUT22|They were able to withstand that and what's driving it?
NEUT23|The consumer.
NEUT24|Yes, U.S. consumer, don't forget the labor market.
BULL25|Tight consumer incomes are still growing at a 4% clip.
BULL26|Stewart and that will continue, I think, to support the US economy.
NEUT27|Even if we do have some trade volatility.
NEUT28|OK, let me give you some more on this because we've got new numbers from the National Retail Federation.
NEUT29|Shoppers spent an average of $50 more this year than last year.
NEUT30|93.2 million shoppers shopped online, 84 million showed up to bricks and mortar stores.
NEUT31|Isn't that exactly what you're saying the consumer is leading this economy.
NEUT32|The consumer is very, very strong.
BEAR33|We've got a tight labor market, one of the tightest labor markets in generations.
BULL34|Low unemployment, low layoffs, high job openings that's pushing up wage growth and that's generating aggregate income.
NEUT35|And when consumers sit down at the computer Stewart, they're not worried about tariffs.
BULL36|They're worried about the best deal that they can find on Cyber Monday, and I think they're finding that that will continue to drive growth and continue to drive earnings.
NEUT37|It's all about fundamentals, OK, bearing all that in mind, do you therefore think that today's sell off following yesterday's sell off?
NEUT38|Temporary blip is it temporary temporary blip on a longer time horizon it's noise.
BULL39|Investors have to stay calm and focus on the fundamental story which is improving focus on the consumer which is the heart of the earnings story and if that story remains intact, equity markets continue to make new highs.
NEUT40|Earnings drive equities.
BULL41|That's the key targets Jiffy that was pretty good.
BULL42|Thanks very much indeed, Sir.
NEUT43|"Sure shopping to the point we love it flat out."""
