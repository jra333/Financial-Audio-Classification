NEUT1|13 F filings are out, Julia Larosa joining us now with more on this.
NEUT2|Julia yeah Sean, I will.
NEUT3|It is 13 F season 45 days after the end of the quarter.
NEUT4|So we're looking for those second quarter stock moves from some of the biggest investors including Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT5|Actually, some really interesting stuff.
NEUT6|Sean, I'm still going to the filing here, but what I'm seeing is a new position in Barrick Gold Corporation, the Gold Explorer, an mining company.
NEUT7|It looks like Buffett snapped up about.
NEUT8|20 million or so share.
NEUT9|So that's a new position.
NEUT10|Of course.
NEUT11|I keep in mind you have Todd Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, who are the portfolio managers for the famed stock portfolio.
NEUT12|What I'm seeing or what I'm not seeing in the filing anymore rather is Goldman Sachs.
NEUT13|If you go back to the prior filing he had a maybe about 1.7 million shares of Goldman Sachs.
NEUT14|The bank no longer seen that in the filing.
BEAR15|Looks like he exited that position in the quarter.
NEUT16|We're still going through this, so we'll keep you updated.
NEUT17|Sean, about a new position here in Bear.
NEUT18|Golden, it looks like he exited Goldman Sachs China Union cold here.
BEAR19|Moving up after hours but certainly interesting here, especially Julia like you point out his reduction that he's been seeing some of these bank shares reducing his stake in JP Morgan and Wells Fargo and in addition to some regional banks as well.
NEUT20|So certainly something that we will keep an eye on.
NEUT21|Julia.
