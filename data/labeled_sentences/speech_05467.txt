NEUT0|"""Is orchid oh XT and dead project?"
NEUT1|Any chance of recovery and life?
NEUT2|And the next bull run alright, good questions, so let's have Bill pull that up.
NEUT3|I think this is what this is also in our internal metrics.
NEUT4|Let's take a look here on our end.
NEUT5|OK, all right.
NEUT6|I mean so from a value investor perspective.
NEUT7|The fundamentals on ocular great technology is.
BULL8|Alright, could be better, but fundamentals it's great.
NEUT9|I mean that's why it made coin base so it's a coin based coin.
NEUT10|But I mean hasn't.
NEUT11|Yeah, I can see.
NEUT12|It basically hasn't done much.
BEAR13|It's just been going down.
NEUT14|Our models don't really have anything bullish happening, but let's see what the TSS.
NEUT15|OK, coming up here.
NEUT16|OK, so one thing of interest.
NEUT17|OK, I'm always looking for the 62% retracement, which is right at about.
NEUT18|Right here.
NEUT19|OK, so basically what this thing is doing.
BEAR20|It's hanging just below the key levels.
NEUT21|The key level, so obviously it needs an upside catalyst.
NEUT22|In terms of where it is right now, so we're looking at a four hour chart again.
NEUT23|Sunday, November 15th.
NEUT24|Now.
BULL25|If this holds $0.22, there is hope.
NEUT26|If it doesn't hold $0.22.
NEUT27|Look out one thing I do think is very interesting about this coin is that there was this huge spike here.
NEUT28|And there are these Wicks right that every time this thing gets to $0.25.
NEUT29|Somebody wants to sell it.
NEUT30|OK.
NEUT31|Right there.
NEUT32|'cause every time it comes up here, look at the black arrow.
BEAR33|There's somebody selling and then they were impatient, just kept.
NEUT34|You know they couldn't wait for it to get to $0.25 as soon as they saw a couple green candles, they hit it again.
NEUT35|Alright now.
NEUT36|I've seen this before.
NEUT37|Anne Aultz in the defie error.
NEUT38|OK, so the sellers the bagholders, 'cause again you notice this has gotten hammered right.
BEAR39|Down from like 30 or $0.40 wherever it was when it was up there.
NEUT40|I've seen Sellers press, press, get out, get out, get out, get out, but they don't crack it.
NEUT41|And what happens is what can happen, not investment advice, but what can happen with these kind of coins is that everyone gets out.
NEUT42|Everyone gives up.
NEUT43|And then all of a sudden, boom, there's a catalyst.
BEAR44|So I think if this thing cracks $0.22, it's probably over, but if it can hold and bounce.
NEUT45|OK, those sellers at $0.25.
NEUT46|I don't know why they still there and course if it gets above $0.25 then it can rally.
NEUT47|So to answer this person's question, is it's probably worth to hold on if you're a bag Holder, and if you're interested in the project, then any next little pop up might be a chance to get involved.
NEUT48|OK, but I wouldn't say it's dead right now, but it's gotta prove itself.
BEAR49|And there's a shot that those sellers at $0.25 are exhausted.
BULL50|Alright, thank you Bill, that was great analysis.
NEUT51|"So tell us what you think about orchid down in the comments below."""
