BEAR0|"""So GameStop just reported earnings and they're down about 11% after hours at the time of recording."
NEUT1|Not too great.
NEUT2|So what happened?
NEUT3|Well, the guy he was supposed to come in, whoever's on the call he's supposed to come in, talk about the bright future of the company.
NEUT4|You know, rally the troops and then leave us on a positive message like this.
NEUT5|The AMC did AMC's earnings call that was a prime example of exactly what he was.
NEUT6|The GameStop was supposed to come in and do.
NEUT7|They didn't do that and it was a short call too.
NEUT8|It's only like 20 minutes.
NEUT9|Then take questions.
NEUT10|All that happened was they said some numbers and it was over.
BEAR11|Very disappointed in whoever organized the GameStop.
NEUT12|Call again years poster out of the troops like.
NEUT13|So yeah, this point in that down about 11 half percent after hours, not too great.
BEAR14|They missed earnings just a little bit.
NEUT15|Now you know the performance of it.
NEUT16|Not that bad, but you know, like, OK, not even the point anymore.
NEUT17|Here's the good news.
NEUT18|The good news is we like to stock and not the company so we don't have to really worry about what he did because the stocks unchanged.
NEUT19|Stocks don't report earnings.
NEUT20|They're not stocks or stocks.
NEUT21|Companies or companies correlation.
NEUT22|Maybe not so sure here.
BEAR23|But yeah, the stock is down 11% after hours.
NEUT24|But good thing is if you like the stock you like the stock you're not worried about the company and the other thing I want to talk about is AMC.
BULL25|The ownership for the Institutional Ownership Percentage of shares held has increased from 11% to 13.45% here in the Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT26|I told you guys I was going to keep you updated with that and I will continue to do so as we see changes the institutional ownership is remains the same for GameStop.
NEUT27|No change there as of yet.
NEUT28|We might get some after tomorrow or over the next like couple couple weeks after this earnings report and just come out and then tomorrow.
NEUT29|We have the short interest data for the first half of March that will be coming out and I'll be giving you guys that information directly from the Bloomberg Terminal.
NEUT30|So even if you know whether it's reliable or not.
NEUT31|This is the best source, and so I will be giving you guys that tomorrow so you have that to look forward to.
NEUT32|You know, I hope you like the stock and not the company.
BULL33|'cause if you do, you're going to feel a lot better than if you like coming up stock.
BULL34|But with that being said, I hope you guys have an amazing rest of your day.
NEUT35|"I'll see you tomorrow."""
