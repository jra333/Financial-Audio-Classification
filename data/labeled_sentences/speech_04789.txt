NEUT0|"""You had an announcement not long ago about training employees, but this is outward facing."
NEUT1|This is big.
NEUT2|Explain the thinking behind it.
NEUT3|Yes hi, good morning Carl and John.
NEUT4|We're so excited about this air announcement is that we're going to train 29 million people by 2025 in all areas of cloud computing, free of charge.
BULL5|It's super exciting and it's building on the program that we launched at Amazon where we announced last year to train 100,000 of our own employees by 2025.
BULL6|So we believe this is a real opportunity globally to up the digital skills and really make sure that no individual is left behind that wants to get.
NEUT7|Cloud computing training.
NEUT8|Yet much of this is going to happen around the world.
NEUT9|What's going to determine?
NEUT10|How much of this resource gets spent in the US versus elsewhere?
NEUT11|Well, we're opening this up to 200 countries and territories, and we originally started a lot of these programs in the US, but they have scaled an A good example of this.
NEUT12|John.
NEUT13|Is there a WS restart program, and that program is specifically focused on the unemployed and the under represented, and that program we've launched in 12 countries already ate this year 25 cities and we plan to double that next year.
NEUT14|And that's a program that I particularly.
NEUT15|Really like because we're focusing on those individuals who do not have a job and may not have any cloud computing skills.
NEUT16|And if I could tell you really quickly, an example that is in the US in Boston, an individual Jerrod Gaines who had a goal of opening a gym, he's a fitness trainer during Kovid.
BEAR17|He had to close the gym.
NEUT18|He had to take a pause on that dream, and he went through our restart program and it's a 12 week.
NEUT19|It kind of intensive training.
NEUT20|For free, an friend that he got a job as a technical worker at a company called ID BS Software Solutions and we have many of those stories.
NEUT21|And that's really what we want to hear.
NEUT22|We want the individuals to quickly be trained on skills so they can go out and get employment.
NEUT23|So to reset if you're a policy maker.
NEUT24|If you're someone who's looking to amplify the affect of this in the US or anywhere around the world, what have you seen as the best methods for doing that to make sure that this free training reaches?
NEUT25|The most people possible and gets them as employable as possible.
NEUT26|Well, we believe it or not, we've actually been doing it through universities and high schools directly.
NEUT27|We do it through social media.
NEUT28|We also have programs on Twitch.
NEUT29|We have something called the AWS Power Hour that we launched on Twitch for machine learning, and so you can imagine the audience that we get there and it became so popular.
NEUT30|We ended up adding a new course called A WS Cloud practitioner and that one is a great course because it gives you all the cloud.
NEUT31|Fundamentals that you can get going with.
NEUT32|It's important not to have it in just one location John, but to have it in many because you want to touch all different groups.
NEUT33|We do also partner with organizations like your app.
NEUT34|In power so that they can also offer these same type of skills and get the word out.
NEUT35|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT36|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
