NEUT0|"""Our guest tonight says he's advising his clients to stick with stocks."
NEUT1|Allen Haff is a partner at Kelly Half Financial.
BULL2|Alan welcome good to have you with us.
BULL3|Thanks Pat and I'm sure you heard what David Tepper said.
NEUT4|He doesn't seem to share your view, he says.
NEUT5|Don't be too long, he said.
NEUT6|Don't go short, but don't be too long.
NEUT7|Why is he wrong, Alan?
NEUT8|Well, look, I mean, David Tepper is hard to argue, but I will have to, you know, I'm reading this interesting book right now, called Think like a freak.
NEUT9|It's the guys.
NEUT10|The road are Super Super Freakonomics, and in the book I just I was reminded this morning.
BEAR11|Analyzed there was a report that analyzed 6000 stock predictions over the last 10 years and and about 40% of them came true, so the prediction business is very, very difficult, especially in a time where there's so much mixed economic data.
BULL12|The beginning of this year, everybody thought bond yields would be higher.
NEUT13|Right now they're not.
NEUT14|The prediction game is very, very difficult, that's for sure.
NEUT15|Alright, so Alan, why stocks?
NEUT16|Because there's nowhere else to put your money right now, for as long as the Fed is going to keep interest rates low, it's just last week.
NEUT17|Yellen said that they're going to keep rates low for at least a lengthy period of time.
NEUT18|There's nowhere else to put money right now, so let me ask you this, if you can put your money into a 10 year Treasury and get 2 1/2% for 10 years, does that sound like a reasonable investment?
NEUT19|A lot of investors today flooded into the bond market, but they're going to be scratching their heads pretty soon and realizing wait a second, we're not making any money in bonds, so as long as those rates stay low, which they will be for some time to come.
NEUT20|There's nowhere else to go right now on this planet, except for stocks, especially the ones that pay nice dividends.
NEUT21|There are a lot of stocks in the S&P 500 is we were pointing out earlier today that actually yield more than the 10 year Treasury, but but back to the point here.
NEUT22|At the beginning of this year I heard an awful lot of folks saying exactly what you're saying.
NEUT23|Why do you want to tie up your money for 10 years at 3%?
BULL24|But so far this year, Allen, the 10 year Bond, has outperformed the S&P.
BEAR25|The Dow Lord knows it's outperformed the Russell and the NASDAQ.
NEUT26|It's up in total return, about 6 1/2% great point so, so here's where I would expand on that theory of staying in stocks because the market is a hole right now is very tricky.
NEUT27|It's not very attractive.
BEAR28|The bond market is outperforming the stock market as a whole in segment plays in the market likes sector funds.
NEUT29|That being said, to stay in stocks.
NEUT30|Right now I'm a big proponent of staying in individual stocks.
NEUT31|You gotta get picky right now.
NEUT32|You can't exactly.
NEUT33|Swear by the indexes swear by the broad sectors being very picky right now in stocks is really the best place to be, at least for the short term because you know again, you're not going to make money anywhere else and to your point, the market isn't doing too well this year as abroad as a broad measurement of everything that's going on.
NEUT34|Alright, so help us pick some of those picky stocks.
NEUT35|Name one or two for our viewers.
NEUT36|Well, I'm not a big fan of predictions, but I will say even prior to the show today when we were on the call early, I did say 18 T was one of my favourites, especially for the longer term.
NEUT37|Because look at a company like AT&T.
NEUT38|It's paying a little over 5% dividend, which is much much higher than the bond rates are right now.
BEAR39|Unreasonable quality companies.
NEUT40|So if you're going to pick a stock like in 18 T and you get fired, you're going to get paid 5% and those dividends are pretty reliable.
NEUT41|If you have to stay in AT&T for five seven to 10 years, will it be worth more than it is today?
NEUT42|From my money, absolutely so that's why stocks like an 18 T are much better place for me to put my money then some long term bond.
NEUT43|That's going to pay me 2% three percent.
NEUT44|I'm going to have to talk about money for that period of time.
NEUT45|May all your predictions come true?
BULL46|Alan, I hope so.
BULL47|"Alright, Alan haven't Kelly happening thanks."""
