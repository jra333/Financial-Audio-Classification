NEUT0|"""OK, I'm looking at Apple stock here and."
NEUT1|What I'm anticipating is a rebound now today is.
NEUT2|June 3rd, 2019.
NEUT3|This is the Monday here.
BULL4|And to me this looks like this is going to rebound tomorrow.
NEUT5|You can see it hit.
BULL6|It's hitting 170 support so it hit one 7027.
BULL7|And you can really see the support on the weekly chart.
NEUT8|You can just see.
NEUT9|That support at one 7027.
BULL10|And really, this supported 170.
NEUT11|Here is very evident.
NEUT12|So.
NEUT13|So.
NEUT14|Let me actually blow that up.
NEUT15|Wait so you can see that 170.
BEAR16|Now obviously the previous month extremely bearish on Apple.
NEUT17|But that doesn't mean we can't profit on a one or two day rebound because right now.
BEAR18|I may still be bearish on Apple overall.
NEUT19|But I can time this in have a bit of a one or two day rebound get in tomorrow if I get the signal and then make a few bucks.
NEUT20|So let's check in in a couple days and see how this trade went.
NEUT21|Hey, it's Dan Charles with simpletrades.net and we're looking at Apple stock.
NEUT22|Several days after I picked this.
NEUT23|I picked this to go up.
NEUT24|On this date.
NEUT25|June the 3rd.
NEUT26|So in other words I picked it to go up.
NEUT27|On the 4th.
NEUT28|And so I was able to get in and the market analyzer clicked.
NEUT29|I was able to click on the market analyzer because it told me.
BULL30|That Apple was due to rebound.
NEUT31|We had support at 170, just like I pointed out in the first video.
NEUT32|And, uh.
BULL33|This was a really, really good trade.
NEUT34|Now.
NEUT35|I'm out of it.
NEUT36|Because.
BEAR37|We started to get far from the moving average.
NEUT38|My other signals started popping.
NEUT39|The overextended indicator.
NEUT40|But I was able to get in.
NEUT41|And.
BULL42|Do quite well for only a couple days of holding on.
NEUT43|So.
NEUT44|To learn more how you can use this market analyzer, we're going to do a lot of videos.
NEUT45|Of my trades and just me.
NEUT46|Using the market analyzer to find trade setups and then will Fast forward in the days to come.
NEUT47|And we'll see how accurate I was so.
NEUT48|Thank you for watching go to simpletrades.net ask me any questions you want on how to use this scanner and.
NEUT49|Will see you in the next video.
BULL50|"Thank you."""
