NEUT0|"""It's it's a funny thing because you look at the losses you look at what took place last year, and then you have to extrapolate out about what you think the future of this is going to look like this year."
NEUT1|Absolutely.
NEUT2|I mean, there's so many.
BULL3|There's a lot of good news in last night's results.
BEAR4|They feed on the revenue line by $490 million, but in the operating income line by $1.9 billion.
NEUT5|So it's just an incredible, you know, there's a lot of leverage in Disney's business is most apparent at the theme parks, followed by film and on the Director Consumer Front, which of course, is what most investors care about.
BEAR6|Right now, they just blew away the Disney plus numbers.
BULL7|But notably, feed on Hulu and ESPN Plus as well, and I guess the other point as we look out, consumer demand seems really strong.
BULL8|Vaccine rollout is progressing, so you are hearing good news.
NEUT9|Hopefully on the theme park front.
BEAR10|But there are price increases coming at the at the Director consumer services, so there's there's a lot going on.
NEUT11|Jessica, just so I understand in terms of raising your numbers and your expectation, you believe people are back in the theme parks and back in the film theater.
NEUT12|You know, watching films in theaters when.
BULL13|To make your numbers, we have a gradual increase.
NEUT14|We don't really expect anything this year, so most of our numbers are 22 and 23 and our price objective is based on 23 and discounted back to today, so 23 being the normal year.
NEUT15|OK, Tom, let's let's talk about some of the growth numbers in the streaming world.
NEUT16|You know the Hulu piece of it's as almost as extraordinary, if not more so, than what's happening at Disney Plus unto itself, no.
NEUT17|No, I don't really think so.
BULL18|I think the Hulu advertising number looked particularly strong.
BULL19|They look like the revenue per sub coming out of Hulu was was very strong.
NEUT20|The sub numbers not so much.
NEUT21|I'm a little more cautious than Jessica here.
BULL22|Look, you gotta give Disney a lot of credit for how much strength they came out of the box with Subs and looks like they will have created in the course of a couple years by the end of this year a direct to consumer business with about 17 billion in revenue, which is really quite a feat, but I think a lot of that is already priced in.
NEUT23|We gotta remember that since they've announced streaming, the company's market cap is already up about it.
BEAR24|$130 billion while their whole media network side and the movie studio side have clearly loss value.
BULL25|So there's a huge amount of value in the direct to consumer streaming business built in already.
NEUT26|But the market seems to respond to the headline sub number in a huge way, and that's where I'd really express some some cautiousness not all Subs are created equal.
NEUT27|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT28|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
