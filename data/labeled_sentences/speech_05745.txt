BEAR0|"""Kelly, a WS, has been seeing a widespread outage for over an hour."
NEUT1|A WS, of course, is Amazon's massive cloud business that powers many companies, websites and operations at large companies in impacted include NYC Transit, SiriusXM Radio Ring, and Adobe Cloud.
NEUT2|The list, so Kelly is long and growing.
BEAR3|The longer that this outage lasts for some, though, like Roku, which is also affected operations, they're still running like streaming, but they may be delayed.
BEAR4|WS spokesperson tells US quote Kinesis has been experiencing increased error rates this morning in our US East, one region that has impacted some of its own KWS services.
NEUT5|They're working towards a resolution, and we will certainly bring you any developments as we get them back to you.
NEUT6|But dear, just to clarify 'cause you showed, for example of a transit.
NEUT7|Customer there I mean are we talking about this disrupting travel or is this more of a back office issue?
NEUT8|Yeah, it's unclear at the moment, but it does look like for many of these companies.
NEUT9|It's more of a back office issue, so as the consumer or user you may not necessarily see it.
NEUT10|I'm not sure what the case is specifically for NYC Transit, but you can imagine that heading into a holiday weekend.
BEAR11|This would not be good news, but these outages are not completely uncommon.
NEUT12|They're usually resolved fairly quickly, but this has been going on for over an hour.
BEAR13|Wow, I'm getting worse.
NEUT14|Like you said as it does wow.
BULL15|OK, sure, thank you.
NEUT16|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT17|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
