BULL8|They're following indices across the globe, the Nikkei when, which was operational when the shutdown when plays pare gains a little bit finished higher Europe's higher as well.
BEAR9|The dollar is getting a sort of the most severe reaction, falling against most major currencies, but not.
NEUT10|Kind of a kind of a non reaction actually.
NEUT11|So far from well so far and we will stay tuned though and will have more on what is actually happening at 10:30 an hour into the day on the market type OK, three stocks you're watching today.
BEAR12|Let's start with Mark Merck Global pharmaceutical company just announced another wave of layoffs are going to lay off 8500 people combined with previously announced layoffs.

NEUT14|How to deal with the loss of excluded.
NEUT15|But for some of their drugs, so that's when it goes generic.
NEUT16|Basically I patented goes generic, you got less price for it, OK Walgreens and interesting symmetry here.
BULL17|Walgreen is still grappling for direction a little bit, but that grocery store chain actually reported a lot higher earnings from a year earlier.
BEAR18|Part of that is increased margins due to the selling of generic drugs, so that stock is a is sort of grappling for directions started hires a little bit lower, but profit after their quarterly earnings report and it.
BEAR19|Diamond food has been a bit of a windstorm, shall we say diamond food is looking like it's going to have more trouble with its with its stock today.
BEAR20|After reporting a loss in part because people are buying fewer nuts.
NEUT21|But then, in part because of some of the accounting issues related to a Walnut related accounting scandal that you alluded to.
