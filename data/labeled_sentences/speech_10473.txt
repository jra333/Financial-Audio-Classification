BEAR0|"""After close things go crazy."
NEUT1|First Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg has a chance to explain listen Mark.
NEUT2|This is your plan to how he plans to create more minority own Instagram shops in the Small Business Administration.
BEAR3|He should challenge the SBA.
NEUT4|It's the right thing to do.
BULL5|And it would also give him some much needed positive publicity.
NEUT6|Honestly though, public image aside, Facebook is cheapest way for small businesses to reach customers in the neighborhood.
NEUT7|So it should have a fabulous quarter even though some of the big dogs have left.
BEAR8|We also hear from Amazon, Apple and Alphabet that same night, and I expect all three to disappoint.
NEUT9|Yeah, you heard me Amazon on its forecast because this quarter will be tough to top.
NEUT10|Apple in current sales because store Closings and Alphabet because that's just what they do.
NEUT11|What's the reality though?
BULL12|We heard from Microsoft last week that in their Azure cloud business was actually a little less than stellar.
BEAR13|I think they may have lost a step due to competition members on web servers ancl at Google Cloud.
BULL14|I expect both companies to have excellent cloud numbers.
BEAR15|The problem with Amazon is that the court is going to be a tough act to follow because now now that most people wear masks, it isn't as frightened to shop in person.
NEUT16|I almost went shopping this weekend.
NEUT17|Apple doesn't like to brag, so they won't pound their chest on.
NEUT18|5G is for your end.
NEUT19|As for innovation, they say that for the conferences, I hope Apple sells off.
NEUT20|May be your last chance to get in before 5G takes over the world.
BULL21|Even with the stock trading 25 times earnings, something I predicted based on the strength of the service revenue stream, it might turn out to be cheaper than it looks on a stay at home order.
NEUT22|Stuff stuff from the App Store basis.
NEUT23|Here's an outrageous prediction.
BULL24|Apple will finally break out the lifetime value of a customer just like a Consumer Packaged Goods company would do because they have incredible customer loyalty.
NEUT25|Remember, this is all about the razor razor blade.
NEUT26|From now on, the iphone's delivery system for apps and subscription services, and you know Siri.
NEUT27|Set my alarm for 4:00 AM.
NEUT28|You know that kind of.
NEUT29|As for Alphabet, what can I say?
NEUT30|I don't even know what a good quarter from Alpha would look anymore, although neither is anybody else.
NEUT31|The thing that's most disturbing that Alphabet is somehow I heard of this guy work school every second.
NEUT32|There are 84,000 Google searches and 85,000 YouTube viewings.
NEUT33|How in the world did not making a lot more money?
NEUT34|Hey, maybe keeping kids at home for school will allow them to cheat on Google and that could drive the numbers on Friday we have Exxon and Chevron which that was joke which have become.
NEUT35|A tale of two cities at some was always kinda chevrons, point no water.
NEUT36|Last week, Chevron bought Noble Energy, now is playing offense.
BEAR37|I don't know what game that sounds played last, but not least Caterpillar reports could be a tough quarter, but they can claim it's all uphill because China, an oil have bottomed the bottom line is fine.
BULL38|Still investable and irresistible.
NEUT39|Should we look elsewhere for gains?
NEUT40|This is the week that we find out.
