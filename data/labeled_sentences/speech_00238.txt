BULL0|"""Perfect day to bring back the RBI."
NEUT1|The most random but interesting thing you'll hear all day and this one may make all of you investors out there feel really good.
NEUT2|It comes from SunTrust.
BULL3|With yesterday's gain at midday, the S&P 500 was up more than 10% in just six trading sessions.
NEUT4|We note that because SunTrust notes, that's only happened 12 other times going all the way back to World War Two.
NEUT5|And with all of those days happening in just the last 50 years and historically.
BULL6|That says very good things about stocks.
BULL7|One year out, SunTrust shows that of those 12 times the SNP rose 10% in six days.
BEAR8|There's only been one time when the S&P 500 was lower.
NEUT9|One year later, that was the tech bubble of 2000, the S&P 500 higher.
BULL10|Eleven of those twelve other times in a year with an average gain 12 months out of 20%.
NEUT11|In other words, a lot of numbers there, and it's early in less you think?
NEUT12|There's a tech bubble like Crash coming.
BULL13|History says given the gains the last couple of days, stocks should be higher in a year on average 20% higher random but interesting and hopefully also profitable.
NEUT14|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT15|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
