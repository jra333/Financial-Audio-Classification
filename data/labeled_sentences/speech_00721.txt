NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, welcome to my channel, so let's take a look to this stock Tesla."
NEUT1|So is the correction over?
NEUT2|Well we have a couple of reasons to believe that yes it is over.
NEUT3|If we go to the hourly chart, we can see an important divisions right here in the muddy this horizontal range in the $860.00 range right here.
NEUT4|The last almost a month since meets general until mid February.
NEUT5|We can see these diversions right here in the monkey.
NEUT6|OK Mac.
NEUT7|The was showing us unimportant divergance right here that finally that finally happened with the.
NEUT8|With this important movement that started in February 8, so we have a couple of reasons to believe that to believe that this movement is over one is this is this candle right here that the counselor yesterday scandal with this long week with long shadow right here?
NEUT9|This is an important reversal signal, but we shouldn't believe only in the in a candle to to buy a position.
NEUT10|Or auto seller position is just a signal, but we need a confirmation of that signal so they can.
NEUT11|Those shows us that the prices stop right here in this.
BULL12|In this previous resistance and support area in the $650 range that is as well right now 50% fewer natural level of all of the last last movement.
NEUT13|So the price almost touch the 61.81 achievable.
BULL14|It's good that it went back up.
NEUT15|Pretty much from there.
NEUT16|Another important reason.
NEUT17|An important signal that this could be the end of the correction is that the volume we have right here.
NEUT18|The volume would suggest that it was.
NEUT19|He was bigger than usual.
NEUT20|OK, it was a big volume, so this also reinforces reinforces this candle on the importance of this candle.
NEUT21|So three things.
NEUT22|Three things here.
NEUT23|We have the volume we have this kind of we have this important resistance area support area right here in the $650 range.
BULL24|So with these three things in mind and take into account that the price is still moving above the 200 moving average, the 200 moving averages turned up.
NEUT25|These things support the theory that the correction is over and the price of Tesla stock is moving back up again.
NEUT26|If you go again to the outlook chart, we can see that.
BEAR27|Yeah, right now the price is moving below the 200 hourly moving average.
BULL28|It could be definitely a signal of a reversal on a signal of recovery.
NEUT29|Seeing the price moving above the 200 moving average and seeing the 50 PM A moving and crossing the two moving often crossing the 200 moving average.
BULL30|But for now the chart is looking good.
BULL31|And yes, let's let's see if the price is able to recover from here, I think we will publish it anyway.
NEUT32|The price is the price reverses from here.
NEUT33|Let us to watch her.
NEUT34|Of course, in meaningless.
BEAR35|The loss of of yesterday, right here in the SI $617.00 the Cherokee.
NEUT36|And Lastly we would have the 61.8 level in $594.00 and as well the 200 moving average that could converge there.
NEUT37|And this is the one point.
NEUT38|If you want to load.
NEUT39|Alright, so yeah, thank you everybody for watching if you like this please subscribe to the channel and stay tuned for more videos.
