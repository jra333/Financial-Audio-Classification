NEUT0|"""It's going to be a video chart on ticker symbol AMZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Well, I mean the state the obvious, but I will anyways just to establish some context here, but very impressive movement on the damn you.
NEUT5|Something about the fact that just on Wednesday the price was down there now lives on, the prices, battled back up to where it has.
NEUT6|I mean, don't get me wrong, there's still work that needs to be done.
NEUT7|But point being from where it was to where it moved.
BULL8|Good solid move.
NEUT9|But that does lead to the valid question of.
NEUT10|But is there any sort of true strength?
NEUT11|Is there any sort of genuine power behind this price we went?
NEUT12|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT13|Dead Cat Bounce type move and I have no idea.
NEUT14|But by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind intervals on a single area.
BEAR15|In that area is down here at the 3165 mark.
NEUT16|Now why is 3165 important?
NEUT17|I'm not saying at all this is what's going to happen, but just for explanation, saying, let's say the price were to come down here, behave in that manner, then continue on down.
NEUT18|What would that be doing to the price?
NEUT19|That would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of that range of the chart that it just broke out from.
NEUT20|I mean not to insult your intelligence but price movements like Go back to where they were not exactly sinotruk power, true strength or anything like that.
NEUT21|Whereas on the flip side of things, if the price were to come down here.
NEUT22|Behave in that manner, then start to work its way back upwards.
NEUT23|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here you have that settles down there.
NEUT24|If you envision each one of those as stair steps, well, hey there we go.
NEUT25|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT26|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT27|That's what it truly strong move is going to do is going to make progress.
NEUT28|And again in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as 3165 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT29|It's all about that pink line right now.
NEUT30|Moving forward, which on my chart denotes the very famous 200.
NEUT31|Moving average, and you can just see time after time.
BEAR32|Again, the prices really struggled around that area.
NEUT33|So if the price does make another move back upwards right now, let's just call it 3220 is going to be the main area to watch from the resistant side of things, but All in all, very nice movement today.
BULL34|Not just a question of can the price continue to build on this momentum moving forward.
NEUT35|Let's see how things play out on Friday 1st off.
BULL36|Thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT37|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT38|But it will be me.
NEUT39|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee.
BULL40|So being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT41|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT42|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR43|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT44|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT45|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT46|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT47|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT48|That is again, totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
