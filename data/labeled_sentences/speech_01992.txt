NEUT0|"""I can't see a very happy ending to this this process, so interim drill or some actresses here and there."
BEAR1|I think at the end of the day is not going to satisfy the markets that we've had so many back and forth that now the pricing for the market is a protracted sort of back and forth going on without necessarily any clarity or resolution.
NEUT2|So if people were expecting this trade deal, whatever to shape or form it comes through would help markets find sort of a better pairing.
BEAR3|For 2020 they would be disappointed in mistaken.
NEUT4|What's that going to mean then?
NEUT5|For the global economy, as we move into 2020, still with this trade issue hanging over us, there are ways to demarcate the narrative is one is the global investment malaise.
NEUT6|If you will, around this trade tension, the other is secular trends in what's happening in the auto industry and the electronics industry there.
BULL7|I think there is some glimmer of hope even without a trade deal, because an electronic side, particularly with regards to 5G and cell phone, we have seen Billings pick up.
BULL8|Shipments will follow and that would help, at least for Asia.
NEUT9|Demand side picture in the first quarter of 2020, which side stands to lose more?
NEUT10|Is it China or the United States at this point in time?
NEUT11|Unanswerable question.
BEAR12|I think it hurts both.
BEAR13|It hurts both.
NEUT14|Let's talk a bit more broadly.
NEUT15|Then as we move into 2020 about the state of the global economy, what do you see happening?
BULL16|Of course we continue to see central banks easing around the world despite the fact that we didn't get it from India yesterday.
NEUT17|But do you see that that trend will continue?
BEAR18|Because a lot of central banks, almost out of firepower.
BEAR19|Essentially this right so kind of running out of room.
NEUT20|And there isn't that much conviction on that string that everybody keeps on pushing on.
BEAR21|All you see is huge amount of liquidity sloshing around the system, causing bubbles at property market.
NEUT22|He ran tech market there without any meaningful turn around in the investment cycle, which in my view is a prerequisite to getting a proper global cycle going, so it will remain lackluster independent of these central banks actions.
NEUT23|But more importantly.
BULL24|This narrative that everybody keeps on, hoping that there will be a secular decline in the US dollar, which will prop up EMF X, which then will create a harmonious pick up an external finance sustainability for them.
BEAR25|I think it's unlikely because we will see all these trade related friction and geopolitical friction and social friction.
NEUT26|All of those things will company into a safe haven flow into the dollar, so Trump will not get what he wants in this area.
NEUT27|Hey everybody, it's Hadley.
