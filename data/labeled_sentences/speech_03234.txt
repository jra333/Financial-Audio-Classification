NEUT0|"""Hello, my name is Simon Mackie and we're going to make a quick financial analysis of Berkshire Hathaway."
NEUT1|We will take a closer look at liquidity and profitability ratios across time to compare the company's current situations with two thousand 70s bershire at the weight is 180 year old holding company.
NEUT2|Its head offices in Omaha, NE.
NEUT3|The current Chairman and CEO of the company is Warren Buffett, one of the most influential men in today's America.
BULL4|In 2018, Berkshire Hathaway, at about 389 thousand employees and its market capitalization is evaluated.
BEAR5|At $517 billion, this video will mainly focus on athletes income in 2018, which was disastrous compared to previous years results.
NEUT6|We will use ratios to understand where the anomalies come from.
NEUT7|We will use intracompany standards for this analysis.
BULL8|As such, let's compare at the ways 2017 and 18 results by looking at the graph, we can observe a small bump in revenue of about 3%.
BEAR9|However, this is overshadowed by the fact that the cost of revenue.
BULL10|Is up by more than 10%.
BEAR11|Consequently, as always, gross profit is down by about 6% after considering other revenues, we can see a big difference between 2017 and 18's net income, the former being much higher.
BULL12|We conclude that expenses grew at a faster rate than revenues during 2018.
NEUT13|This is obvious if we analyze profitability ratios such as the net profit margin.
NEUT14|Since Hathaway's net profit margin for 2018 is only about 1.6%.
BEAR15|Compared to 1718.7%, investors will be less inclined to buy shares from the company, since financial rewards will be less interesting.
NEUT16|Let's compare athletes current ratio with older results and analyze if the company has a liquidity problem or not by looking at the spreadsheet, we can see the value of current assets hasn't very very much between the two years.
BULL17|However, current liabilities have increased by 17.6%, which means the company has more short terms obligations than last year.
NEUT18|But this necessarily have more liquidity's to pay with.
BEAR19|This greatly affects the current ratio, says the increase in current liabilities lowers the ratio nonetheless, with the current ratio of three point 16 after we still has a lot of room to work with, and it has no liquidity problem, even though the ratio is much lower than the previous year, it is still way above the critical value of 1.
BEAR20|Conclusion After West Financial performance in 2018 was worse than its previous year, mainly because the net income has dramatically decreased.
BULL21|Is better difficult year Brookshire after which certainly has the means to bump backup 1019.
NEUT22|If you have any questions concerning this analysis, feel free to ask them.
BULL23|"Thanks for your time and I'll see you in the next one."""
