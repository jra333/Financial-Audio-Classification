NEUT0|"""Here's a quick update."
NEUT1|I sold all sound for a small profit.
NEUT2|I.
NEUT3|Nothing wrong with it.
NEUT4|I saw some opportunity somewhere else.
NEUT5|I see that the lowest 80 then.
NEUT6|So I bought at 900.
BEAR7|So there's still a little downside to where I bought.
NEUT8|That's why I'm selling right here.
NEUT9|You don't want to sell, its totally fine.
NEUT10|The resistance is at 960, so you could hold it is totally fine.
NEUT11|I used the profit to buy more Coke.
BULL12|I could see opportunity here.
NEUT13|Cold is the only value stock that filled the gap.
BEAR14|It broke support at 52 an is a gap right now.
NEUT15|So I bought the gap.
NEUT16|All the other value stocks did not break.
NEUT17|"The support code is the only one, so I see an opportunity here, so I used that cash to go into Coke."""
