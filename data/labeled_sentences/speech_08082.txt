BULL0|"""Apple is currently at an interesting point where it can either aggressively push up or at least temporarily pull back to a small degree just enough to be in a good price for you, and I can both get in on and then ultimately continue its push up."
NEUT1|What's going on?
NEUT2|Guys?

BULL5|Please like the video, it really helps us out.
NEUT6|I make daily videos like these breaking down good stocks by and I like to make beginner friendly videos in general, let's go ahead and get right to it.
BULL7|So today we can see that Apple premarket hours made highs of one 2388.
NEUT8|On the day and it made loads of about 122, right?
NEUT9|So it primarily hung out in this zone right here, right?
NEUT10|Hung out in this zone right here.
NEUT11|All day.
NEUT12|Market is still open.
NEUT13|It's 9:30 and it is currently meeting this resistance right here, right around the 123 mark, right?
NEUT14|So again, Apple just generally hung out around this zone, but what I'm more interested in showing you is how it looks on the 180 day chart, right?
NEUT15|That's the more long term chart.
NEUT16|That's what I like to use as a reference so we can tell that Apple based off of previous performance right, is at a potential resistance and this is what I mean, right here, right?
NEUT17|I'm just going to draw this line so you can see what I mean.
NEUT18|Previously, every time the Apple hit this zone right here, it would pull back right?
NEUT19|So it pushed up his own, pulled back, pushed up his own, pulled back.
BEAR20|Kind of tried to get near the zone, and then ended up curling, pulling back, and now we're currently near that zone again right now.
NEUT21|This doesn't mean that we absolutely have to pull back aggressively or anything like that, right?
NEUT22|There's two options.
NEUT23|One, it contemporarily kind of pull back and correct itself, and then ultimately continue its push up right.
BULL24|Or it can break above this, use a previous resistance as a new support and continue its push up right?
NEUT25|So this is where it really comes down to managing risk, right?
NEUT26|Being calculated with your entry.
NEUT27|Another thing that I wanted to be noted is that Apple follows the mini NACAC right?
NEUT28|This is a very popular index that many big tech companies like to follow.
NEUT29|And as we can see, this index is a little over extended right?
NEUT30|So it would make sense for Apple to potentially pullback.
NEUT31|Right again, it doesn't have to, but recently the mini NASDAQ made all time highs right as we can see it of 1250.25.
NEUT32|I think that may actually may have been today, so whenever something is so overextended, it has to temporarily pull back in correct itself to continue its uptrend right again.
NEUT33|That doesn't have to happen.
NEUT34|I'm just saying that it tends to and it wouldn't make sense for it to right?
NEUT35|So again, Apple follows this index.
NEUT36|Might be something that you want to use as reference if you're considering getting in on Apple, right?
NEUT37|And you want to know which way it's likely to go if you just Google literally Google the many nastic.
NEUT38|It's a really good reference point for it.
NEUT39|How it can perform.
NEUT40|And again I'm just going to go ahead and bring it up once more so you can take a look at it yourself.
NEUT41|And if you want to analyze stocks in a more long term approach consider using this 180 day chart right to analyze them.
NEUT42|This really helps you don't even have to know anything about looking at charts or whatever really just looking at the line right and see where it has these resistance levels.
NEUT43|You can tell where it is at your opponent to push up, or when it is that you are prone to pull back, right?
NEUT44|So just wanted to make you aware of this.
NEUT45|Again, I personally am breaking down Apple because I do want to get on it myself as well, so I'd like to make these videos for you guys to analyze as well where it is that it currently stands at the end of the day, I'm not a professional, right?
NEUT46|This is not professional advice.
NEUT47|This is just my opinion, but.
BULL48|I hope it helps you in anyway right?
NEUT49|We also have a private Facebook group.
NEUT50|For those of you that are interested.
NEUT51|It's called country solutions.
NEUT52|I'd like to recap might raise right there.
NEUT53|We make other videos we call out good stocks to buy.
NEUT54|It's absolutely free.
NEUT55|I'll go ahead and leave the link of the description.
