BEAR0|"""For US at 157 thousand jobs last month below expectations, unemployment rate did go to 39, closing in on its lowest level in 50 years, joining us exclusively today."
NEUT1|Goldman's chief economist Jan Hatzius is here at Post 9 John Good to have you welcome.
NEUT2|Nice to hear you say, given the combination of the revisions and then this Toys R Us wrinkle which we talked about earlier this morning.
BULL3|You think the report indicates a faster underlying rate of growth?
BULL4|Well, yeah, I think the averages have picked up.
NEUT5|I mean both the three month and the and the six month are now above 220 K and if you add.
BULL6|You know something for this one off factor in in in Toys R Us then I think it's very rapid payroll growth.
BEAR7|You look at the Household survey and the drop in the unemployment rate was due to very strong household employment growth.
BEAR8|It wasn't due to weaker labor force participation, so this is a firm report.
BEAR9|I think in July is historically weak as I understand.
NEUT10|Well yeah, although they do seasonally adjust these these things so I would tend to, you know, take this at face value in terms of the seasonal adjusting.
NEUT11|So and then moving to wages your take on that today.
NEUT12|You said 27 no real news on that.
BULL13|It was a little stronger than we thought.
BEAR14|We had expected a bit more of a negative calendar effect.
NEUT15|So if you adjust for the timing of the survey week in the in the month, maybe it's a little stronger, but you know nothing.
NEUT16|Nothing major.
NEUT17|I think in terms of the wage numbers.
BULL18|Overall, I think what we're looking at here is still a very strong jobs job job market, very rapid employment growth far above the underlying trend that's needed to stabilize the unemployment rate, which is in the low one hundreds.
BULL19|But wage pressures still fairly limited, 10 year yield went back above 3% this week.
NEUT20|It's now sitting below that.
NEUT21|If you ask people what does that tell you, you get 100 different answers.
NEUT22|How do you answer that question as it relates to the US economy?
BULL23|I mean, I think it has moved higher over the last couple of years as the economy has strengthened.
NEUT24|That said, I think you look at the long term.
BEAR25|You know the the the term premium at the long end of the curve is still very depressed.
BULL26|Central banks around the world are still still buying the Bank of Japan still running a very easy monetary policy.
NEUT27|ECB hasn't stopped the purchases yet.
NEUT28|I think all of that has something to do with the very flat curve in the very low.
BULL29|"Tom Premium at the at the long end, but we have seen increases that have been pretty sizable relative to where we were back in 2016."""
