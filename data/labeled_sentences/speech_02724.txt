NEUT0|"""We're joined by Andy Scheer."
NEUT1|He's a economist, well known for his contrarian views.
NEUT2|He actually did predict the subprime mortgage crisisalsothe.com bubble in the 97 Asian financial crisis.
BULL3|Andy, thanks for coming on.
NEUT4|Well, you know, that's quite a track record.
NEUT5|You got there.
NEUT6|So are we in a bubble now?
NEUT7|I think some parts of the world it's I'm talking German in China has a property bubble and the reason is it caused it to the exchange rate.
BEAR8|Appreciation expectation has been sucking money and that's creating increasing money supply.
NEUT9|So despite very rapid economic growth rate, interest rates very low.
BEAR10|So that's leading to speculation in the property market.
NEUT11|So I think that the the property price probably isn't 100% overvalued, and normalization will only happen when interest rate is sufficiently high.
NEUT12|Just like a well done every night stage.
NEUT13|And if you raise interest rates, you sucking more money don't you?
NEUT14|I doubt it.
NEUT15|I think people kind of coming not for a little bit of higher interest rate in emerging market.
NEUT16|Usually how money comes for stock market bubble or property market bubble.
NEUT17|Anytime that you have a currency appreciation story somehow there will be bubble and I think that it's happening in China so.
BEAR18|You what you're saying also is that these rising house prices, and by the way that at the moment so showing some signs of slowing down if not actually depreciate ING right now.
BEAR19|But this rising house prices market has sucked money out of the equity market, which is why it's done so badly.
BEAR20|Yeah, this talk about the equity market being the coupling for the last couple of years, the stock market collapsed in 2008 from 6000 + 216 hundred.
BEAR21|They really spooked a lot of people.
NEUT22|So especially rich people who fought there.
NEUT23|Property was safer, so they've been pumping money into the property market.
NEUT24|Now.
NEUT25|The stock market.
BEAR26|That's why we have these two years of unusual phenomenon that this property market in the stock market market at the coupling Citigroup, BNP Paribas Paribar recently predicted that we will see a 20% drop in home prices in 2010.
NEUT27|Do a agree with that and be.
BULL28|Would you see a 20% increase in equity indicies?
BEAR29|Well, right now we're seeing a moderation in the secondary market.
BEAR30|And the volume going down a lot in the primary market.
NEUT31|However, I think that the people still believe that the government will have to change its current policy.
BEAR32|The current policy basically discriminate, inspires a lot of buyers are kept out because the local governments depend on the property market for financing, so this policy may not be sustainable.
NEUT33|That's why I think the developers still don't want to cut prices, they're waiting for the government to change its policy, and as long as the primary market stays firmly.
BEAR34|I think that the price correction is temporary.
NEUT35|So ironically, if we had the one of them be revalued, this could also take the sting out.
BEAR36|Yeah, I think that if the the currency is revalida sufficiently to get rid of the expectation, then the property market will really go down hard.
NEUT37|I don't think they did.
NEUT38|The government wants to do that.
NEUT39|Chinese government wants to wage to go up but not at the exchange rate.
NEUT40|So I think that the market is getting China Chinese.
BEAR41|Chinese government's intention wrong.
NEUT42|So what about the wages side of things is what we're talking about here as well.
BEAR43|Yeah, I think wages China is entering our decade of the Raptor wage growth, mainly because that the one child policy is impacting labor market and other countries are not yet ready to take over from China in manufacturing during this.
BULL44|Which will go up dramatically, I think manufacturing wage will double within five years already, seeing that of course Foxconn.
NEUT45|But that's for reasons all together separate out there.
NEUT46|"That's right."""
