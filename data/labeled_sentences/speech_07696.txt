NEUT0|"""Warren Buffett is the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway."
NEUT1|He's one of the most successful investors in the world and has a net worth of over $78.9 billion.
NEUT2|As of August 2020.
NEUT3|So why the **** is he selling Costco?
NEUT4|This news take investors by surprise.
NEUT5|Berkshire Hathaway has been building and holding Costco shares since 2000.
NEUT6|The timing is extremely odd.
NEUT7|Buffett is exiting Costco right when Costco has announced a $10 per share dividend.
NEUT8|You must be holding the stock on December 2nd to receive the dividend payout on December 11th.
NEUT9|The question is why would Buffett hold Costco for 20 years and dump them before a major dividend payout?
NEUT10|If you calculate 4.3 million shares times $10 per share, that's $40.3 million.
NEUT11|Can't Buffett just hang on a little longer, then sell and take the extra profit with him?
NEUT12|He can then take that extra cash to invest more of Amazon or whatever he wants.
NEUT13|But hey, he is not the Oracle of Omaha for nothing.
NEUT14|I'm sure he knows something we don't.
NEUT15|A theory.
NEUT16|Charlie Munger is Buffett's right hand man.
NEUT17|Charlie has been on Costco's board since 1997.
BEAR18|Charlie is 96 years old and he is bound to step down from Costco's board anytime now, perhaps without Charlie on the inside, buffet no longer feels comfortable hanging onto the stock.
NEUT19|There's also a possibility that Buffett is eye for more of Amazon stock, of which his company currently owns 533 thousand shares but still can T wait a little longer.
NEUT20|Is it a tax thing, or is moving funds around to grab another stock immediately?
NEUT21|Is better than holding on.
NEUT22|It's hard to question Buffett's move.
NEUT23|After all, he's a legend.
NEUT24|"However, it will be interesting to see how this plays out."""
