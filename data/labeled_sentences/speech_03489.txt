NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome to my channel, actively passive investments."
NEUT1|Today is Tuesday, February 2nd and the market is about to close.
NEUT2|It's 3:53 PM Eastern.
NEUT3|In this video, we're going to be talking about Apple ticker symbol AAPL.
NEUT4|So Apple is currently trading at one 3524, which is a point 8%.
BULL5|Increase from yesterday's price.
NEUT6|We could see here over the past few days.
NEUT7|We've been trading within this downward moving channel, which is consistent with how Apple has been reacting for a while now.
NEUT8|As you can see here.
NEUT9|Downward then break out that goes sideways.
NEUT10|And then breakout downward, breakout sideways, breakout, and so on.
NEUT11|So right now what I'm watching here is this upper range to see if there's going to be a breakout outside this price.
NEUT12|Outside this line, or are we going to have a continuation?
NEUT13|Of this channel.
NEUT14|Now overall of course.
NEUT15|As you could see from these two purple lines.
BULL16|Apple is bullish.
NEUT17|What I'm looking for here is.
NEUT18|Is Apple gonna maintain this downward channel or is it going to break out and trade sideways until it gets closer to the 50 moving average before the next rally up?
NEUT19|Switching over to the hourly chart, what to look for tomorrow is.
NEUT20|I'd like it too.
BULL21|For us to have a breakout above this.
NEUT22|Line we should trade tomorrow above the 136 line which is aligned with this Brown line, which is the 50 email line in terms of resistance.
NEUT23|We do need to break above 136 thirty four in order to see a bullish movement and break out from this downward moving channel.
NEUT24|On the other side, in terms of a support, should port line around the one 3374 doesn't hold, then we could see.
NEUT25|And movement to the downside, so we could see something like this.
BEAR26|And then we could see a downward movement.
NEUT27|Is this purple line, which is if we zoom out?
NEUT28|It's the bottom part of this bullish upward moving channel.
NEUT29|For these two prices.
NEUT30|I'll post an updated video.
NEUT31|If we can get some sort of a confirmation on which direction Apple decides to go?
BULL32|And this could be helpful as usual.
NEUT33|Thank you for watching.
NEUT34|"And seeing the next video."""
