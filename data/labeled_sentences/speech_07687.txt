NEUT0|"""I'm Eric Butler from Menlo Park, CA."
NEUT1|A couple of questions, one serious one, not quite considering.
NEUT2|Berkshire Hathaway is well run at low cost and is diversified.
NEUT3|Why should anyone do anything but put all their money?
NEUT4|Into Berkshire Hathaway, instead of maintaining a diversified portfolio.
NEUT5|And in some of these.
NEUT6|Hit your graphic kind of biographies.
NEUT7|It is apparent that you have other investments yourself beyond Berkshire Hathaway.
NEUT8|The second question I had is there any significance to the fact that the.
NEUT9|Omaha World Herald does not include Berkshire Hathaway in its stock tables on any day.
NEUT10|Is this a sign that?
NEUT11|They do not honor profits now.
NEUT12|They actually they have a separate little table called Midlands.
NEUT13|I think it's entitled Midlands investment but they they they pick out about.
NEUT14|50 stocks that are of particular interest to people in this area, and they lift those from the regular table and put it in this separate table, which is usually on a second page right following the main stock table, so they they give us are just do on that, but you do have to.
NEUT15|You should look in a different table for that.
NEUT16|Second question, by putting all your money and I've got 99%.
NEUT17|My money in in Berkshire an but it was bought at a different price.
NEUT18|Anne Charlies was bought little cheaper do I think so you know we we we like the idea of having it all in there but we don't recommend that.
NEUT19|People do that because it's you will get very low cost management.
NEUT20|What we hope well we hope is it from this point forward that that cost does not reflect its value, but.
NEUT21|The price at which you enter is very important.
BULL22|You do get a great group of businesses.
BULL23|You get a lot of great operating managers.
NEUT24|You get very reasonable costs.
NEUT25|But that is fairly widely recognized now compared to the past an and people.
NEUT26|People pay more for it than they used to it.
NEUT27|I'm still very comfortable with it, and I think Charlie's comfortable with it too, but but everyone has to make up their own mind about about price Charlie.
NEUT28|Yeah, eventually.
NEUT29|If the success continues and we have more of this hagiography.
NEUT30|The stock will get such a high price that it's.
NEUT31|No longer.
NEUT32|Sensible at all to buy.
NEUT33|We hope we.
NEUT34|Dampen that process this week.
NEUT35|As we go along, you know.
NEUT36|And of course, there's always the very substantial chance that.
NEUT37|Will just fail to.
NEUT38|"Meet expectations due to the vicissitude's of life falling on her face is what we call it."""
