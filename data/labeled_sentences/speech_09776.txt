NEUT0|"""He is claiming this via video chart on ticker symbol FCEL."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR4|Well, a rough the price gap down and you know pretty much just drifted lower and lower the entire day long.
NEUT5|So certainly updates here need to be done from the technical point of view, first update that needs to be done come about based on a foundation rule in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance, so $14.50 was that area of resistant.
NEUT6|Or excuse me was that area of support going into the day, but now that the price is broken down blow up that would be you know one of the newest areas of resistance.
NEUT7|Although what I'm going to do here is actually just this down because even before you focus on that as an area of resistance.
NEUT8|The level that really stands out to me is that first key level right there at $14.25 'cause you can see there was a little miniature balance right there.
NEUT9|Which brings up the question.
NEUT10|OK, that bonds failed, but where did it fail?
BEAR11|Well, it failed right there at $14.25, so I'm not saying that that implies that the you know the chart and the price could never get up above that area again.
NEUT12|I'm just saying that to me that seems as though the main area where if the price does try to consolidate out and then it work its way back upwards.
NEUT13|The big question Mark now becomes OK. Let's see if the price can actually get up above and you know stay above 1425.
BULL14|'cause that's right where it failed previously.
NEUT15|So keep an eye on that.
NEUT16|If there is any sort of attempted, you know bullish movements in the upwards direction as far as levels of support or concern.
BEAR17|Nothing new here to report talked about this area in past videos at 1350 and while the price didn't quite hit it today, it's definitely getting closer and closer to potentially becoming in play in the event the price does breakdown below that level.
NEUT18|The next key level to watch very closely would then be down there right around the $13.00 mark, so keep around these technical levels moving forward and let's see how things continue to play out.
NEUT19|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT20|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it.
NEUT21|But it will be me live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL22|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT23|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT24|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but.
BEAR25|In a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT26|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT27|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT28|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT29|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT30|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
