BULL0|"""Fire up merk."
NEUT1|I folks I have a PhD in chemistry, so these chemical companies are near and dear to my heart.
NEUT2|Go ahead, put $1 billion company.
BEAR3|It's called 100 billion, eighteen PE, so index there, but not terribly nice profit margin expected with drug companies.
BULL4|23.4% Pillar #3 revenue growth.
NEUT5|39.539 point 840-4247.
NEUT6|Now here's the interesting thing to check.
NEUT7|Mark pharmaceutical companies like acquisitions.
NEUT8|This doesn't look like a lot of acquisitions been made.
NEUT9|Maybe they have been.
NEUT10|I don't know, but they tend to like acquisition, so either way it's still a check mark at income.
NEUT11|4.442 point, 46.29 point eight step, then check mark there at number of shares outstanding, 2.82 point 5-6 another second current assets greater than current liabilities is building number 616, point 6 billion in current assets 20.4 and current liabilities.
BULL12|So they have six and change in extra cash lying around, which is good free cash flow growth over the past five years, 11.38 point, 74.68 point 310.
NEUT13|So check Mark for growth.
NEUT14|The average is 8 1/2 * 2171.6 close.
NEUT15|Not there yet, but close, so it is a little expensive.
BULL16|Based on the free cash flow will expensive in the PE, but if you think there's a lot of growth potential there that could be justified in this nice dividend.
NEUT17|I would still be waiting a little bit to buy it.
BEAR18|It's already seem like it's dropping down a little bit the last year it was at a peak of 92 down to 81 down here.
NEUT19|I've definitely been buying so where where my buyer at?
NEUT20|I don't know, 8.
NEUT21|Maybe moment I can do some research and look at this one and probably buy at The thing is guys.
NEUT22|I'm a value investor going to buy it a massive discount to where I think the value is.
NEUT23|So I think the value is 70 bucks.
NEUT24|Here I want to buy it like 40 or $50.
BEAR25|I look for companies selling we have below their actual value, so that's the big thing to understand here.
NEUT26|Like I want to buy Merck much lower than this.
NEUT27|So let's look at the momentum here for Merck.
NEUT28|So this is 1 to watch because the momentum just shifted.
BEAR29|So right now it has some negative momentum going which is fine.
NEUT30|Just to wait for this to go above the three year date.
NEUT31|So that's where it's at right now.
NEUT32|Last time it crossed over was in October of 18.
NEUT33|At 71 and you would have sold at 78.
NEUT34|You made a little bit of money, so you bought it 71 and it got all the way to 92 and you're giving back profits all the way to 78.
NEUT35|That's what this training does that you lose out on.
NEUT36|You don't get the high in the low.
NEUT37|"You get somewhere in the middle, but it's more consistent."""
