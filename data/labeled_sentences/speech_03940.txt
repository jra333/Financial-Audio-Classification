NEUT0|"""Once you know why it's important to use stock charts and the basics of what's in a stock chart, let's put it all together and discuss the three telltale clues to look for when analyzing stock charts."
BULL1|Now, after you familiarize yourself with these three key concepts, you'll be ready to spot profitable chart patterns.
NEUT2|Those are the launching pads that kick off virtually all major stock moves.
NEUT3|Clue number one.
NEUT4|What's the trend?
NEUT5|With just a quick glance at a weekly chart you can see at the stocks in an uptrend, a downtrend or just trading essentially sideways.
NEUT6|You only want to buy a stock when it's already moving in the right direction and that's up.
NEUT7|There's no need to take the risk of buying a stock that's clearly heading South.
BULL8|Wait until the stock can prove its strength by rebounding into an uptrend.
NEUT9|And when a stock is trading sideways there's no clear trend.
NEUT10|Again, reduce your risk by waiting for a new uptrend to begin before you buy.
NEUT11|Clue number two.
NEUT12|What story is the price and volume action?
NEUT13|Telling charts show you if a stock is being heavily bought or sold by fund managers and other large investors.
NEUT14|This is super crucial because it's these large institutional investors that had the power to push a stock higher or lower.
NEUT15|Now figuring out what the large investors are up to is easy.
NEUT16|All you need to do is check the price and volume action in the chart.
NEUT17|These big investors are managing so much money that they're too big to hide what they're doing.
NEUT18|So you can literally see what they're doing by looking for unusual spikes in volume.
NEUT19|Think of it this way, when the stock price is up significantly and the number of shares traded is well above average, that tells you fund managers and other large investors are heavily buying and on the flip side, when the stock is down significantly in unusually heavy volume, that shows you fund managers are aggressively selling or getting rid of the stock.
NEUT20|Long story short, always check the volume when looking at any changes in share price.
NEUT21|That will tell you how serious the buying or selling actually is.
NEUT22|Anne Clue #3 is a stock finding support or hitting resistance.
NEUT23|Think of this like a floor of support or a ceiling of resistance.
NEUT24|When a stock pulls back, you really want to see if it finds support at key areas such as the moving average line, aprior by point, or even sometimes a round Number in the stocks price.
NEUT25|Look at Nvidia's chart starting back in 2016 and see how it found.
BULL26|Support at the ten week line along its big run.
NEUT27|If the stock does find support.
NEUT28|It means large investors are stepping in and supporting the stock that can be assigned to hold or even add.
BULL29|Cheers to your position.
BEAR30|If the stock rebounds higher from that support level, but if the stock fails to find that support and crashes right through moving average like the ten week line and heavy volume, that's often add triggered a sell.
BEAR31|That means fund managers are now aggressively dumping shares.
NEUT32|The concept of resistance is especially key when it comes to spotting the best time to buy a stock after a stock forms of floor of support.
BULL33|And starts to climb higher.
BULL34|It'll eventually come up against a ceiling of resistance.
NEUT35|That's a key testing ground.
NEUT36|Will it punch through that ceiling in heavy volume, or will it simply bump its head an come back down?
NEUT37|The best time to buy is when the stock proves its strength by punching through a former line of resistance in strong volume.
NEUT38|Now we'll get more into that later, but All in all, when you're looking at a stock chart, start by checking these three telltale clues.
BULL39|Doing that will give you invaluable insight into the health.
NEUT40|"An outlook of that stock."""
