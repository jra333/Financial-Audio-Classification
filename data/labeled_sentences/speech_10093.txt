NEUT0|"""Right now, though, let's talk about deflation and beer."
BEAR1|Many people have been warning about deflation.
NEUT2|Maybe they wouldn't be so concerned if they had a beer.
NEUT3|Bloomberg's Dave Wilson is here to explain, and I'm going to start with a question that I can't believe I'm asking.
NEUT4|But why should we care about what's happening to beer prices?
NEUT5|Couple of reasons, really.
NEUT6|You know.
NEUT7|A few months ago we were talking about green shoots for the economy getting out of recession.
NEUT8|You can argue that what's going on the beer market now is a green shoot in terms of inflation.
NEUT9|You have Anheuser-Busch in Bev and Miller Coors, the two biggest Brewers in the country.
NEUT10|Coming out and saying we're going to raise prices later this year, and there's the other issue which we've seen as the recession is played out.
NEUT11|The whole idea of consumers trading down, you know, buying cheaper products Now if these beer makers figured that a price increase would force them to trade down it, maybe it's something they wouldn't be doing, so perhaps a vote of confidence in consumers willingness to spend here.
NEUT12|So why would you see Anheuser-Busch and InBev?
NEUT13|Anheuser Busch in Bev, I should say in Miller, Coors, these acquisitions.
NEUT14|These mergers happen so fast I can barely.
NEUT15|Keep up fascinating to drink a can of beer.
NEUT16|Why would they raise prices more later this year?
NEUT17|I mean, why now?
NEUT18|Well, they're in a better position to do it, and the fact that you're tripping over the names kind of tells part of the story you know.
NEUT19|Last year, Miller and Coors put their US businesses together and came up with this joint venture.
NEUT20|And of course an Anheuser-Busch ended up being bought by InBev.
NEUT21|The Brazilian and Belgian Brewer try saying that three times fast, but you know, they have pricing power that they didn't have.
NEUT22|And actually if you look at the overall numbers, the government keeps track of.
BULL23|You turned out five point, 3% increase in prices last year when inflation was flat.
NEUT24|We gotta run Dave.
BULL25|Thanks very much.
NEUT26|"We're back until."""
