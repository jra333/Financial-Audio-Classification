NEUT0|"""Senate Finance will hold a key vote today on Janet Yellen's nomination for Treasury Secretary sometime in the next hour that could potentially set up a final floor vote later on today, which will be the first Test of the bipartisan support, not just for the Cabinet nominees Jim, but for the $1.9 trillion relief package."
NEUT1|On Wednesday, it was Senator Romney had some questions about why are we moving so fast.
NEUT2|We just passed 900 billion and then yesterday was Susan Collins.
NEUT3|How much of this is truly at risk?
BULL4|Yeah, the pushback is starting and I think that.
NEUT5|Look, I'm I'm not president, but I think that the everything about the vaccine is all systems go.
NEUT6|I think that the stimulus money in people's pockets all systems go.
NEUT7|But once again I gave it, you know, the state thing.
NEUT8|They don't seem to.
BEAR9|Other Republicans understand that the states are broke.
NEUT10|And because they think that only some states are broke.
BULL11|But yeah, Covid has been an equal opportunity Destroyer.
NEUT12|It has, but it has been an area of lack of any unity whatsoever, and there was obviously not really included.
NEUT13|Now there is aid that is going to the states in the form of other types of aid, but there is not direct aid to the states to fill to help them maintain budgets so that they don't have to lay people off or make drastic cuts in services.
NEUT14|And that's a question the Democrats supported Mitch McConnell as Majority Leader, of course was not and you heard it sort of being demonized as a red state blue state thing and.
NEUT15|Heard these words, you know, criminality somehow in the blue states it was unfortunate, but it doesn't mean that that's going to really move the debate a lot.
NEUT16|Given the administration's in there will say, do you think it mattered that they were both sides respectable to Janet Yellen when she was on the Hill?
NEUT17|I don't know how you can't be respectful to Janet Yellen.
BULL18|I agree.
BEAR19|I agree, quality think the problem is that there are lots of people who still believe that there are only some people who are really hurt and there are many people who aren't.
NEUT20|And that's actually true.
BULL21|I mean, we've gotten tremendous.
NEUT22|This is the K economy.
NEUT23|A tremendous number of people who are going to take that check, and they're going to go buy whatever SPAC Dave is about the trash.
NEUT24|That's a joke.
NEUT25|David doesn't trash backs, he brings them to life.
NEUT26|Thank you.
NEUT27|I say that because David is the only one other than the CNBC 50 that actually spending some time looking at this pack.
NEUT28|Supposed just buying this packs.
NEUT29|But the amount of people in from the merry men who want to put that check to work buying Unity software, buying crowd Strike, taking a swing at door Dash, thinking Airbnbs a bargain called they are real and you see them in the stocks are being shorted against them, betting that the Merry Men will run out of fuel.
NEUT30|But if they get those checks they run out of fuel, are going to go right back in and these people are real and I think people need to recognize their real buyers.
NEUT31|We've been talking about this for almost a year.
BEAR32|The excess savings Paul Tudor Jones said this would be the first recession we ever went into where households ended up coming out ahead.
NEUT33|The flow of that money into online gaming and stocks.
NEUT34|I guess the question now is Jim, you know you got fundstrat last night, saying COVID-19 is in full blown retreat.
NEUT35|You have the covid tracking project saying hospitalizations and deaths are starting to normalize.
NEUT36|I mean, how much stimulus makes sense?
NEUT37|And if in fact it's getting a little brighter enough to be able to make the line move for the Chiefs, I don't know.
NEUT38|I mean that money is going.
NEUT39|Football betting maybe 5 billion this weekend, but yeah, I don't know.
NEUT40|I think the doctor felt she was really incredible yesterday in it, but I didn't feel any sort of reassurance at all because he's a realist.
NEUT41|Unmuzzled fouchy.
BULL42|What a pleasure.
NEUT43|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT44|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
