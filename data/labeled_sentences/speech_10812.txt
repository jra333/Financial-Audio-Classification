NEUT1|Remember to check the links in the descriptions for free Bitcoin free stocks free by bit and much, much more.
NEUT2|Don't study in the description if you are interested in these links.
NEUT3|If not, let's get straight into the video.
BEAR4|Remember to smash a like for the future episode we're having Mara today Marathon Patent Group Inc is down 8% on the day, but if we take close attention with with what is happening is not only down 8% on the day, but is actually a down in the last two.
BEAR5|It is first of all following the crypto obviously, so it reached a peak of 51% when it had the big Bitcoin drop in February and now is down 20% from the all time high.
BULL6|So considering from this point right here, if we will be reaching the whole time high again, you will have approximately 25% profit without risk to reward of.
NEUT7|121 let's say if this.
NEUT8|If you buy right now, even if I think it's kinda risky play because considering you buy at this level, what do you think?
NEUT9|Do you think is a good level to go in considering in the past in the past few months this level was broken many, many times, so how can you find a good level where to go in positions you just look at the chart.
NEUT10|And then you try to understand from December.
BULL11|Until now we had a big rise with a consolidation, another big rise, without consolidation at orders without consolidation.
NEUT12|And if we go on the formula chart, we can see that this third one was the biggest one where it was rejected, not one time but two times.
NEUT13|And then it started to reach again, don't I'm headed that yet hasn't reached, so we should be prepared for a touch on all time high, another rejection, approximately I'm I'm not.
NEUT14|I'm not sure because I mean nobody knows.
NEUT15|But approximately, let's say between these buying zone and this buying zone right here.
NEUT16|So potentially Nora, if it will have another deep another rejection, it will be by opportunity in between of these zones right here.
NEUT17|If you want to average in and open a position right now, I will consider for yourself even if I'm not a financial advisor and do not take legal advice based on my information.
NEUT18|But I would based on the data analysis of the chart that I'm doing, I will consider.
NEUT19|Personally.
NEUT20|Watching this channel right here, because if we watch this channel right here, we had many points where it was actually broken versus the upside and quite a few points where it was broken versus the downside.
BEAR21|If we check this channel right here and the next downtrend, it is going to stop.
NEUT22|Maybe at this line or in this channel right here and then start again versus the outside.
NEUT23|If we go on the one day and we make a.
NEUT24|Little channel like this we could see.
NEUT25|Something like the final touch.
NEUT26|We could have the final touch.
NEUT27|As you can see, back inside, outside, inside, outside, inside, outside we could have now the final touch before a big rise that we had in February.
NEUT28|So potentially this.
NEUT29|"It's not going to make you only 20% until the all time high, but if we see, for example, a bit going to."""
