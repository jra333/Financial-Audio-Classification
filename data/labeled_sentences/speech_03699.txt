NEUT0|"""Or anyone take a look at Facebook."
BEAR1|So I think the stocks a little bit overextended, but it's got a really clear by point on a pullback.
BULL2|Now Facebook taken down like everything else that we were in March, bottomed out here around 1:40 Ish and is already up to 210 stocks, up 50% in about the last six weeks.
NEUT3|And usually when this happens it's going to trace someone.
NEUT4|Give you a second chance to get in and I want to show you where I'd buy it.
NEUT5|Now we take a look at the volume profile for Facebook all the way back here to the 2016 kind of pause for this thing really took off.
NEUT6|We get this nice profile.
NEUT7|They very clear point of control right here around $179.
BEAR8|The red line going across the chart and if you'll notice every time the stock makes a run it tends to retreat to this.
NEUT9|So we came here the 180 mark back in 2017 fell came back to it, pushed higher, came back, paused at it, went lower, came back and just continues to be a retracement point for this stock.
BEAR10|And since this stock is now overextended alongside.
BEAR11|Most of us agree the market is not yet priced in all the bad news stocks will likely come down again before we make new highs and when it happens, it's very likely that Facebook will pull right down here to the point of control to 179 bucks.
BULL12|Pick up some buyers before extending its run higher and probably making new highs by the end of 2020.
NEUT13|"So that would be looking at Facebook 179 called a 180 by point for Facebook looking for a $30 retracement and then getting long FB."""
