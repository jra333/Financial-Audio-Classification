BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This will be a video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple.
NEUT2|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame before I get started.
NEUT3|From the disclosure standpoint I do own Apple shares from the long side in my retirement account.
NEUT4|So just keep that in mind as I go through the analysis real quick.
NEUT5|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT6|In case maybe new charts instead of each of these candle sticks here representing one days worth of price action, which is what you would normally see.
NEUT7|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT8|So while this error may look like several weeks worth of time, it's just the past three days broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT9|I'll let you this time frame thing.
NEUT10|It's a good job of telling the quote, unquote story of the price, and then makes mapping out where levels of support and resistance a bit easier to see.
NEUT11|And this is definitely, you know, a shorter term type timeframe, so you know whether you're a day trader or swing trader.
NEUT12|But I mean, if you're looking for some sort of, well, tell me how to approach this 'cause I want to hold for the next 20 years.
NEUT13|That's not what this is about.
NEUT14|This is more so geared towards a trader, not really an investor.
NEUT15|So from that perspective, what immediately stood out as far as kind of the short term pattern here is, let's get these lines in place.
NEUT16|Whoops, let's change that around.
NEUT17|There we go, so we have this portion of the pattern right here and then we have this portion right there an in technical charts we would call that a rising wedge, which sounds bullish, but it's actually a bearish pattern.
BEAR18|So rising wedge is falling.
NEUT19|So in the short term and over the next few days next week it would not be shocking at all to see the price you know.
NEUT20|Eventually you know, pull back here.
NEUT21|As you know it's made a big move.
NEUT22|So I mean to talk.
NEUT23|Pullback is not really revolutionary.
NEUT24|It's not really a gutsy call, but I mean it's not shocking to see that a rising wedge has fault or has formed.
NEUT25|So yeah, a pullback would not be shocking at all.
NEUT26|You know if the price does drop below that lower portion of that red line are right there.
NEUT27|So that's why I want to focus on some of these areas of support in the event that the price does pull back, which is looking like.
NEUT28|Will likely happen in the first level of support that I'm very curious to see.
NEUT29|You know how the price acts around is right here at 2:05 fifty.
NEUT30|The reason for that is you go back and you look at the past history of the chart and you can see both there and then right there.
BULL31|That level did a good job of holding that support so you know it now.
NEUT32|Still, if 205 does not hold, I'm not saying the entire chart ruined or anything like that, but you know that would serve it.
NEUT33|Still had the chart looking very, very powerful in the event 205 is not a hold in the chart, you need to take a bigger of a pullback.
BEAR34|The next key overall level of support would have been on the previous breakout point, right down there around 2:01, give or take.
NEUT35|I mean we're talking about a $200 stock so 201 give or take.
NEUT36|You know, 1520 cents would be that next overall level of support as far as levels of resistance.
NEUT37|I'm not going to really focus on that because you know the whole premise right now is that it's looking like a pullback is coming.
NEUT38|But you know, if the price can actually push through this upper portion of that red line, you know, then that would just be a blue Sky breakout 'cause apples you know.
NEUT39|Obviously at all time highs, so we'll see what happens with it.
NEUT40|But yeah, if I, you know.
NEUT41|In my approach next week will be more so bearish in the sense of it's looking like this needs to pull back with the rising wedge, but no such thing as a guarantee in the market.
NEUT42|But it'll be interesting to see how this plays out.
NEUT43|One of the biggest questions I get is a clay.
NEUT44|How do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT45|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT46|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT47|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part.
NEUT48|It's completely free.
NEUT49|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT50|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
