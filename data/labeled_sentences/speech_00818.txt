BULL0|"""Meantime, a Goldman Sachs analyst is expecting growth to continue above 2% in the second half of this year, despite growth slowing substantially over the past few months."
BULL1|The analyst is basing his prediction on the last three mid cycle slowdowns and also strong jobs data.
NEUT2|This is coming as the bull market's 10th anniversary is approaching that will be on March 9th.
NEUT3|Joining us now is Lido Island Advisors managing partner Jason Rotman, Jason Great to see you.
BULL4|Thank you so much.
NEUT5|Likewise, do you agree with the Goldman view on this?
NEUT6|I do an, you know, I'll give you a couple reasons why.
NEUT7|Reason number one is that you know whenever a market comes off, some type of highly emotional fundamental fear, such as not only last October, November, December, fear, number one was that this trade deal would never happen and China and the US would continue just to walk in opposite directions.
BEAR8|That's why December 24th was this crazy emotional capitulation low #2 at the same time.
NEUT9|To make matters worse.
NEUT10|For the stock market, there was this government shutdown that would potentially never end.
BULL11|Now we're kind of getting out of that kind of perfect storm for the Bears to overtake.
BULL12|The Bulls were actually going to do OK. My opinion based off of technical analysis as well as kind of fundamental thought.
BULL13|I don't think we're going to see new highs, but I don't think we're going to see a correction.
NEUT14|I think this year is going to be a rangebound year, but that does not mean there are not great opportunities in the market.
NEUT15|Alright, well you look at a day like today, right?
NEUT16|We're sort of used to this kind of volatility, but you start out strong.
NEUT17|Then one piece of economic data out of the United States.
BEAR18|Couple of fears about whether this China negotiation can move forward and all of a sudden the Dow is down 242 points.
NEUT19|So is it possible to sort of predict growth trends or make calls like this in conditions that are so volatile?
NEUT20|Well, this is this is the best environment actually for investing, especially short term investing.
NEUT21|Is it ever possible to make growth predictions 345 quarters down the road?
NEUT22|The only time when it's really possible is when there's zero interest rates.
BEAR23|An growth is simply inevitable, or Europe negative interest rates were coming out of that fundamental environment.
NEUT24|It's going to be a little bit more difficult to predict growth, but I'm always coming back to this year.
NEUT25|Especially this is a year for stock pickers, not not.
NEUT26|Index buyers OK, so are there any stocks that you're watching in particular that you can share with us?
NEUT27|Sure, many, many about I'll share a few and actually are related to China number one, Alibaba.
NEUT28|I mean I've been calling this an everywhere I could since the one 30s in the one 40s.
NEUT29|That was like the steal of the century to buy Alibaba in the one 30s.
NEUT30|I continue to be a long term bull on that stock.
NEUT31|I see that stock appreciating over the next 3-4 five years upwards of maybe 300 plus dollars.
NEUT32|Also there's kind of an upstart electric vehicle company Neo Anio out of China.
NEUT33|That has earnings after the Bell tomorrow, so expect major volatility for Neo.
NEUT34|But that is kind of a story.
NEUT35|Momentum stock right now.
BULL36|But if they can beat revenue, an electric vehicle production tomorrow, I would expect a major bull run on Neo.
BULL37|OK, bull market turning 10.
NEUT38|You know we can grab a cake or do whatever it is to celebrate.
NEUT39|How much longer can this go?
NEUT40|Is this going to be an expanded bowl run?
NEUT41|It's not as I stated before.
NEUT42|I really, truly do believe I've been doing this for 20 years.
NEUT43|I don't think people should get freaked out over over what I'm about to say.
BULL44|I just think it's going to be a rangebound year.
NEUT45|We may finish up two to 3%.
BULL46|OK, great to see you Jason.
BULL47|"Thank you."""
