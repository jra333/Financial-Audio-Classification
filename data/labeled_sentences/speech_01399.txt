BULL0|"""Welcome back today."
NEUT1|We're going to take a look at the cryptocurrency bat BA T which is basic attention token and do some technical analysis on it, so I'm going to look at it against U.S. dollar coin based off of Coinbase prices and just kind of give my thoughts as to where this chart is heading.
NEUT2|So looking at this chart, this is a beautiful chart like there's no other way to say it.
NEUT3|This isn't extremely nice looking chart.
BULL4|You know we've had a.
BULL5|He had a big pop, some consolidation, another big pop, some consolidation and now it's pushing up towards those highs that had previously had.
BEAR6|So I'm a little bit bummed out that I hadn't, you know, been able to talk about this one sooner.
BEAR7|Didn't even realize what was happening, but it was forming these higher lows.
NEUT8|It finally broke out of like that one.
BEAR9|25126 level and closed above it on the daily.
NEUT10|You can kind of see that, like, right around here was where there was some heavy resistance.
NEUT11|So you know, just moving forward now.
NEUT12|I either want to see this one start to get some increasing volume similar to here or here and really start to break out.
NEUT13|I think the big spot to watch at this point is right around the highs, about $1.00 and.
NEUT14|$0.40 But this is an extremely nice looking chart with some pretty clear risk to reward.
NEUT15|So a couple of support levels to watch at this point, or $1.27.
NEUT16|And then this rising trend line would be kind of the next logical level of support, but with a pattern like this.
NEUT17|With this break out if they can start getting a little bit more volume, I would expect this one to either consolidate kind of in this range here for a little bit, or just immediately start to, you know, break out and started to push highs.
NEUT18|I mean, this could be a chart that's anywhere from ready today.
NEUT19|To ready in a couple of days.
NEUT20|But if we look back like all the way back at the four hour chart, you can draw out this resistance that it just finally crossed on the four hour all the way back.
NEUT21|You know, in mid to early kind of March, this like March 18th Ish day.
NEUT22|Closed above it, I mean this one is just has a beautiful look to it.
NEUT23|Huge pop.
BULL24|Lots of consolidation pushing for highs again, you know they can again start to consolidate above these highs around like that 127 ish mark.
NEUT25|You know there's no reason why this one either doesn't immediately break out or consolidate a little bit more.
BULL26|And again support levels that I was talking about remain the same.
NEUT27|I really don't want to waste anymore of your guys's time.
NEUT28|You know this clear levels to watch as far as support go.
NEUT29|And then there's clear levels to watch being you know this.
NEUT30|Previous high is kind of the next big breakout spot, but overall this is a beautiful looking chart, so as always I'm not a financial advisor.
