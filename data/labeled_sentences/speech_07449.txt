BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to the notes."
BULL1|We had an interesting week to say the least, although we ended up not so far from where we started.
BULL2|Perhaps the critical developments that people will be taking a look at all that the US stocks did full fairly significantly.
BULL3|Oil took a very big step up.
BULL4|Perhaps most importantly though, as we've already reported during the week, you continue to see great concern around financials and you also see very strong buying interest.
NEUT5|In the yen.
BEAR6|Despite the widespread belief that the Japanese authorities are going to have to intervene to weaken the yen, that still hasn't happened by the end of the week, people are now speculating about helicopter money as a possibility, but for the time being the yen is strong.
NEUT7|Now let me just try to make a couple of points about what is underlying the week's activities.
NEUT8|First of all, let's take a look at the oil price.
NEUT9|This is daily percentage moves in WTI crude over the last two years.
NEUT10|The point at which a lot of money was lossed comes along here.
NEUT11|You can see in percentage terms it doesn't look that dramatic.
NEUT12|'cause obviously when oil is over $100 percentage moves will tend to be rather lower.
NEUT13|You have seen in the last three months alot of drama, a lot of chopping and changing in the oil price involving a move of comfortably more than 5%.
NEUT14|Twice just this week you can see why people try day trading oil.
NEUT15|Big if you actually get your timing rates, you can make a lot of money.
BEAR16|The main point for now is to is to say first the fears at the beginning of this week that we were getting into another strong downtrend for oil have been allayed at least for now.
BEAR17|And Secondly, we are still in an era where oil remains extremely volatile and that makes it difficult to make forecasts for the broader market.
NEUT18|Secondly, apart from the oil market remains very important.
NEUT19|Let's take a look.
BULL20|At the remarkable continuing outperformance of the US, what we're looking at here is the MCI ephah index covering the developed world outside the US compared to the S&P 500, and you can see that over the last five years, starting roughly when the US lost its investment grade credit rating in 2011, the underperformance by the rest of the developed world has been quite stunning, and that continues to be true.
NEUT21|In the last few weeks.
BULL22|Even though both the yen and the euro have been strong against the dollar, which should all other things equal mean that their stock markets denominated in dollars would outperform the US.
NEUT23|I've commented various times during this remarkable trends that it can't go on much longer and it has.
NEUT24|It still cannot go on indefinitely.
BULL25|It remains quite remarkable that the US outperforms to this extent.
NEUT26|That is one critical point we should all bear in mind.
NEUT27|Now we can get used to.
BULL28|"I'll get ready for next week and the beginning of what could be a very important earning season here in the US."""
