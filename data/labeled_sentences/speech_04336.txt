NEUT0|"""Viral timberville he asked."
NEUT1|Do you think value investing is still relevant in a GDP decreasing world?
NEUT2|And what about passive investing?
NEUT3|Well, that is easy.
NEUT4|Value investing the way I regard it will never go out of style because value investing the way I conceive it is.
NEUT5|Is always wanting to get more value than you pay for when you buy a stock and that approach?
NEUT6|Will never go out of style.
NEUT7|Some people think that value investing is you chase companies which have a lot of cash and earn a lousy business or something.
NEUT8|But I don't define that as value investing.
NEUT9|I think all good investing is value investing.
NEUT10|It's just that some people look for values and strong companies and some look for values and weak companies.
NEUT11|But but every value investor tries to get more value than he pays for what is interesting is that in wealth management a lot of people think.
NEUT12|They have 100 stocks.
NEUT13|They're investing more professionally than they are.
NEUT14|If they have four or five.
NEUT15|I regard this as insanity.
NEUT16|Absolute insanity, I find it much easier to find four or five investments where I have a pretty reasonable chance of being right that they are way above average.
NEUT17|I think it's much easier to find 5 than it is to find 100.
NEUT18|I think the people who argue for all this diversification, by the way I call it diversification.
NEUT19|Anne, which I copied from somebody Ann.
NEUT20|And I'm wet way more comfortable owning two or three stocks, which I think I know something about, and where I think I have an advantage.
