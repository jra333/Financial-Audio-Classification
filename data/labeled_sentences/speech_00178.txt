NEUT0|"""First off, as a part owner of the Dodgers, I want to I know you're good friends with Tommy Lasorda, so my sympathies there."
NEUT1|Scott, they've got a new coach in Heaven.
NEUT2|So welcome to the program, Scott, your Bitcoin 400,000 comment got a lot of attention where it was that tongue in cheek?
NEUT3|Or do you mean it?
NEUT4|No, no, I mean it was really interesting.
BEAR5|It was a passing comment in an interview and be honest with the Brian, I could have said the United States government is bankrupt and the Federal Reserve is insolvent in bitcoins going to 400,000.
NEUT6|Someday an they would have just talked about Bitcoin, which which tells you something.
NEUT7|I mean, it's it's telling you that it's getting to turning into a bit of a frenzy.
NEUT8|You can see you know a number of trading platforms are saying that they're going to start limiting.
BEAR9|Orders to buy Bitcoin because they can't keep up with the retail demand.
BEAR10|I mean, these are all signs of a frothy market and you know, markets like this are prone to harsh setbacks.
NEUT11|But it doesn't.
BEAR12|You know, over the long run undermined the bull case.
NEUT13|And the bull cases.
NEUT14|As we heard earlier, 21 million will only ever be mind 18 and a half about that outstanding.
NEUT15|You have firms like Guggenheim, which is said in the future.
NEUT16|You may be able to allocate a certain percentage to the crypto's, not just Bitcoin.
NEUT17|If you got a lot of demand and very little supply.
NEUT18|It's like Tesla.
NEUT19|Tesla had five million shares outstanding instead of a billion, Tesla stock would probably be a $1,000,000 equity.
NEUT20|But yeah, and it's it's interesting you're right, and I think decimalisation is going to be ultimately the solution to you know the the total valuation.
NEUT21|It's just like splitting your stock.
NEUT22|You know Bitcoin, it can be decimalized down to 8 places, so you know we quote, you know.
NEUT23|You know stocks, for instance, in dollars and cents, and so you know it.
NEUT24|It wouldn't be uncommon to decimalize this to to get into more tradeable sizes and pieces and and a price that doesn't look.
NEUT25|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT26|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
