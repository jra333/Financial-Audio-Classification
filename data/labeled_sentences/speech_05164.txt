BULL0|"""Hey, it's clean."
NEUT1|This will be a video chart on ticker symbol NBEV.
NEUT2|We will take a look at 30 minute time frame real quick.
NEUT3|What do I mean by 30 minute?
NEUT4|In case maybe new charts instead of using these candle sticks here, representing one days worth of price action, which is what you normally see.
NEUT5|Each one represents 30 minutes.
NEUT6|So all this here may look like several days worth of time.
NEUT7|It's actually today's price action broken down into 30 minute time slices.
NEUT8|I'll let you this time frame and it's a good job of telling the quote, unquote story of the price, and in this situation makes mapping out a very logical question quite straightforward.
NEUT9|That question revolves around the fact that today the price made a really nice movement.
NEUT10|When you consider the price was on Friday and then you look at where the price closed today, any rational person and say yeah, the price definitely made a very very nice move, but that does lead to the valid question of.
NEUT11|But is there any sort of true true polishness behind this price movement?
NEUT12|Any sort of genuine strength or genuine power?
NEUT13|I have no idea, but like I said, by using charts we can make answering that question very straightforward and in my mind it all revolves around a single area.
NEUT14|In that area is down here at.
NEUT15|The Dollar 85 mark was $1.85.
NEUT16|Important will hopefully we can all agree on the logic that price movement with genuine power with true strength the price is going to progress for the price is not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT17|I'm assuming you're saying hey thanks Captain obvious.
NEUT18|Of course, if your price movement is truly powerful, it's not going to go back to where it was.
NEUT19|That would be a total contradiction exactly.
NEUT20|So.
NEUT21|With that in mind, think about $1.85.
NEUT22|Any sort of closes blow there.
NEUT23|Or worse yet, if the price separates of the downside, what would that be doing in the price that would literally be put in the price right back inside of that big old range that it just broke out from?
NEUT24|Again, going back, not a sign of true strength or as let's say, the price pulls back here.
NEUT25|Behave in this manner, then start to work to way back upwards.
NEUT26|What would you have in this situation after even a pretty drastic pullback?
NEUT27|Well, you'd still have a set of lows there.
NEUT28|You'd have those lows there.
NEUT29|You'd have these loads down here if you picture these a stair steps while the overall stair steps would still be making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT30|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT31|That's what it truly strong move is going to do.
BULL32|It's going to make progress forward and one final time in this situation.
NEUT33|I'm defining and quantifying the phrase make progress as $1.85.
NEUT34|What about levels of resistance?
NEUT35|For this kind of scrunch up, a chart here a little bit, always a good problem to have, as you had to go back into the charts history.
NEUT36|Overall though, next key, big level of resistance seems to be right up here, around $2.45, and that is just simply coming from the previous highs from back in early September, right here with the price.
NEUT37|Couldn't quite get through it anyway.
NEUT38|Look at it though.
BULL39|Very very nice movement today on the Bulls part, not just a question of can the bulls built upon this momentum going forward we shall see.
NEUT40|One of the biggest questions I get is likely, how do you find the stocks that you trade?
NEUT41|So what I've done is put together a free resource guide where I talk about the tools that I use to locate stocks that I find interesting and think may have potential.
NEUT42|So if that sounds like something that could add value to you as a trader, then click on the image that is up on the screen right now and I will email you the guide.
NEUT43|The guide itself is very short and to the point and best part it's completely free.
NEUT44|Thanks for watching the video.
NEUT45|"Let me know if you have any questions."""
