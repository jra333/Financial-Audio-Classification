BULL0|"""Retro retro welcome back to 1,000,000 by Nephew."
NEUT1|His nephew in this video I just want to make a quick video talk about Netflix, want to get an idea from you guys but you thought was going to happen next?
NEUT2|Now I know about the covid situation.
NEUT3|Obviously a lot of people are staying at home for the stay Home Challenge and I just want to know that you think that the stock is going to shoot up or shoot down based on where we are on this charge and I'm looking at a trend line here.
NEUT4|You can see.
NEUT5|This thing is trending upward, is kind of looking like it wants to go up.
BEAR6|It's been going up for years and I'm not knowing if it's going to drop any lower.
BEAR7|But this is this drop right here is due to the market.
BULL8|Of course an from here it could be a recovery coming soon based on the fact that Netflix is a home entertainment service streaming service video.
NEUT9|So you guys let me know what do you think is going to happen?
NEUT10|Is this thing gonna make it or is this thing gonna fall apart alright?
NEUT11|So what I'm looking at right now is a possible place for reversal.
NEUT12|You can see right there.
BULL13|If it does reverse then we'll be looking good.
BEAR14|But I've also thinking that it could also drop down.
NEUT15|Maybe into the 300 range again?
NEUT16|Maybe perhaps in order to.
BEAR17|Just because you know this might be just a bad time for Netflix, given the fact that they're also competing with Amazon and a bunch of other services.
BEAR18|One thing I notice is that Amazon has the new feature on their website for watching movies that are actually in theaters right now, and I know Netflix doesn't have that, so that could take some of the customers away.
NEUT19|There's a lot of movies that need to come out, and they can't come out with the movie.
NEUT20|Theaters are closed, but then again, that also brings me to the other conclusion that sense the movie theaters are closed.
NEUT21|There could be a lot more people at home watching.
NEUT22|Netflix because they might not want to spend a whole lot of money on movies since they're also buying tissue and stuff like that to survive so Netflix could fit.
BEAR23|It could go either way from what I'm looking at, but you could see this was a decent consolidation period from it going up, it came down at the highest point it touched over 400.
NEUT24|I mean from where it's at right now.
NEUT25|332 to 400.
BULL26|That's a decent run.
NEUT27|I mean, I was hoping to go back down at three if it gets down at three, I'll definitely buy some car options and then I'll try to drag that trade out for.
NEUT28|For awhile so I can make some decent money off.
NEUT29|Netflix, Anne.
NEUT30|See what we can do so you know this channel is mostly about, you know, just picking out really good times to buy really good long term trades.
NEUT31|Also day trade as well, but also swing trade as well.
NEUT32|So I do just about every strategy.
NEUT33|All I do on this channel is trying to make money like it doesn't matter if I hold it for a day or hour a week, a year, whatever I have to do to make the money would make itself.
BEAR34|I'm down for that.
NEUT35|So that's what millions by nephews about.
NEUT36|If you didn't know that, go ahead and smash that like button if you haven't already done so.
NEUT37|They help me with the algorithms real difficult.
