BEAR1|Today we're looking at Euro USD on the daily chart so zooming in and we can see that the your appears to have slowed slightly with the development of an inverted hammer pattern ahead of the April 2017 gap of 1.08.
BULL2|Twenty to one point Zero 777 following a dissent which deflected off the 50 day simple moving average around one point 1095 the short term oscillators, although still negative, are showing him marginally increasing positive momentum.
BEAR3|That said, the nearing bearish cross of the 100 day SMAD by the 50 day one and the distancing of the downward sloping 10 consent from the blue kingen sunline all suggest that maybe the downward move Manger awhile longer to the downside.
BULL4|Immediate support could come from the April 2017 gap from 1.08 twenty to one Point, Zero 777, which also encapsulates the 1.07 ninety three level, this being 123.6% Fibonacci extension of the upper leg from 1.08 seventy 8.
