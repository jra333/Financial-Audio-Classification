NEUT0|"""Hello everybody, welcome to my channel."
NEUT1|Today we're going to analyze the stock Virgin Galactic before we start.
NEUT2|Just wanted to let you guys know that if you have any study would like me to analyze?
NEUT3|Please subscribe to the channel and on hesitate to write it in the comments section right below.
NEUT4|Alright, Virgin Galactic.
NEUT5|What we have here.
NEUT6|So this is a Polish dog that we have seen following this.
BEAR7|This upward trend is bullish trend since it started in the prices started moving at the end of 2019.
NEUT8|So right now we've seen over the past couple of months the price had huge bullish simples that took the price of the way too.
NEUT9|$6263, so what's the price doing right now?
NEUT10|We can see right here.
NEUT11|All these scandals.
NEUT12|It is lonely shadows long weeks.
NEUT13|This is a ceiling and this is a sign of reversal.
NEUT14|OK, this doesn't mean that the price is not bullish anymore.
NEUT15|The price experience a huge bullish impulse are now is time to correct.
NEUT16|Hold these all these movement.
NEUT17|So where are the levels to watch right here?
NEUT18|So first we have the Dell time highs, the 2020 OK, the maximum of 2020 run in the 42 point $25.00.
NEUT19|So this is a good level to watch and another important levels to watch the football match levels.
NEUT20|If we draw the lines between between the minimums of January and the maximum self.
NEUT21|Of February, so allow us to watch first thirty 38.2 fever Nachi level 47, point $58 and then very very important level to watch is this is the 50% Fibonacci level in 42 point $86 quite this level is so important because this level is exactly the same level of this support level we have right here.
NEUT22|That was the maximum of 2020.
NEUT23|So this is a very very important level that.
BULL24|I think if we if we are thinking about buying this stock, this could be definitely a good good price to jump in.
NEUT25|And finally we have the the last few minutes level right here in the $38.00 that I don't think we will see.
NEUT26|But if we see could be very important to see Virgin Galactic respecting that price.
NEUT27|So the price is reversing right here.
NEUT28|OK, it's not a good moment to buy, but if you are holding the stock, I think it's not.
NEUT29|A good moment to sell, either because this is a bullish talk.
NEUT30|OK, so watch for these levels, which are for the 47 point, $58 and also for the 42 point $86 because these levels in these levels stop should be able to find a support.
NEUT31|So let's see.
BULL32|We see if we see the price rejecting these levels and this could give us a signal that the price is has found a support and it's starting to consolidate levels and starting to make its way back up again.
NEUT33|So if we zoom in, just take a closer look at what the price is doing, we have the price trading sideways over the past couple of weeks.
NEUT34|Of course with huge movements because that's this.
NEUT35|This is a very volatile stock, so this is normal to see huge movements, but we have as we can see right here, the Mac, the Mac the is showing us a very very important divergance that as well suggests that the price has found the ceiling that the price is about the.
NEUT36|Blueberries on there is.
BULL37|This is a very good signal that the price will experience an important correction so.
NEUT38|As I said, watch out for the for the for the fever, Nachi levels for the first eight point, $58, and most importantly, the 50% retracement in 42 point $86.
