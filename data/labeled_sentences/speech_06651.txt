NEUT0|"""Hello everyone and welcome back to extend channel is Monday March 23rd and Euro dollar will be the market we will be looking today after last week's sharp sell off."
BEAR1|Reactivated the two year old bearish structure and push the price to fresh four year lows.
BEAR2|Today the Pristiq down to 1.06 thirty five before bouncing slightly up, but the bearish bias is still intact as the arsina stochastics have yet to show, convincing rebound above oversold levels.
BEAR3|While if you look at the 20 day moving average it has reversed.
BEAR4|Down and it's ready to drop below the 200 day moving average, which is another discouraging signal are therefore even though upside corrections wouldn't be a big surprise since the market is still near oversold levels are the focus, will be more on the downside than the upside.
BEAR5|Especially the price fails to recover above 1.0, seven 77 and instead move down to retest today's low of 1.06 thirty five in case we break below that floor, we may immediately may immediately stop somewhere between 1.0.
BEAR6|560 and 1.05 a key restrictive zone back in 2017 they break off, which could trigger a sharper cell of torts at 1.0.
NEUT7|Three forty are looking to the upside.
BULL8|Now we need to rally above one point.
NEUT9|1238 tourism hopes of an uptrending market, but the distance is quite far at the moment and with several cycles first to determine upside corrections could be the one point.
NEUT10|Oh 777 support level followed by 1.08 seventy.
NEUT11|8 awhile higher would also like to see the closure above the Chymical cloud and the one point 10 level.
BULL12|If we manage to overcome that two then a rise above 1.11 and more importantly above one point 1170 could make their way towards one point 1238 much easier.
NEUT13|So that's all from me.
BULL14|"Thanks for watching and have a great day."""
