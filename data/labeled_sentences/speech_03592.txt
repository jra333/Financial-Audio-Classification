BEAR0|"""Good afternoon, the market is closed and some of the trades that we're going to feature was the great rally that had pushed."
NEUT1|The Google up to our price target.
BULL2|Our price target was they could walk it up to 850.
NEUT3|RMB 8:45 and we got to eight, 4394 this morning.
NEUT4|We gap up and we sell straight down.
BEAR5|The put options were tradeable, 710 was a low.
BULL6|We 750 they went up from 710 to 1690.
BULL7|Ten contracts was a $10,000 gain the 20 contracts here today at 7:00 and a half selling at 15 1/2.
NEUT8|That's huge amount of money.
NEUT9|One thing about overbought levels, particularly in high frequency trading technologies as we finally hit the top.
BEAR10|Where it couldn't go any higher and it was extremely overbought and due for a pullback.
NEUT11|Basically, over the last couple of days, run up to here.
BEAR12|We had the $15 reversal on the bellwether New Bull Google, so Google is a good buy down around 800 as it should trade down to that level going forward over the next few weeks where we would look at trying to put some money to work for the call side of the market.
BEAR13|This is day one of that $15 high reversal.
NEUT14|This was the wholesale that close at 1014 on the 8845 put the other one that paid huge, monumental money was the 8:40 put, which was $7.00, a market four and a half.
BEAR15|Beginning at five they went up to 1280, and that's all based on Google having a $15.13 reversal off of the high four pullback in an extremely overbought level in high frequency trading technologies that have walked us.
NEUT16|To such an overbought level at the Great Bull Train, it's a great story and people have moved out of Apple and they've moved into Google and we always said that yeah, this thing is going to get cooking and and the volume was 2.86 million nonetheless.
NEUT17|What we do look at is where the call side.
BEAR18|Once again, the $830 call was at Pier at 1430 and the bids now and they're too inflated.
NEUT19|They have to come down, they have to come down.
NEUT20|They will always come down, Mr. R. Mr Are they will not stay up here at 1860, they will come down to the lows and the put side of the 8:40.
NEUT21|We finally hit the exhaustion and these were the big trades and if you don't stick with them and you don't wait for these overbought processes to reach their final destiny and you're not in AM.
NEUT22|You gotta be in him when they work on this side of the market.
NEUT23|And you gotta know where that upper end of that exhaustion level is going to be.
BULL24|Once again, I'm going to conclude the trade of the day was finally where that stock would give all its gains up.
BULL25|Yes, it's super strong, they're tradeable off the bottom.
NEUT26|Yes, we're back down here, but this is over bot.
NEUT27|And the more overbought we get, that's where Google likes to have these inner day reversals.
BULL28|"And we hit it and it was a great trade."""
