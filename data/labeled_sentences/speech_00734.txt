NEUT0|"""Hello everyone again, welcome to these new supply and demand stock analysis."
NEUT1|This time we're gonna do it on Tesla ticker TSLA.
NEUT2|This is a trading disclaimer.
NEUT3|You can post the video and read it at anytime.
NEUT4|OK, let's start.
NEUT5|I'm going to be using the monthly timeframe because this is the last time I DD analysis on Tesla on the YouTube channel and this is updated more often on the Training Committee of certificate.com.
NEUT6|So here in the middle with time frame, the chart of your screen, you can see you can read TSLA and 1M.
NEUT7|That means that every single candle stick on this time frame 3% a month of time.
NEUT8|So by the time price was going up and all that.
NEUT9|We were mentioning hey no longer allowed or their respective pressure drop and retrace and pull back all the way down to that area after mine.
NEUT10|And that is exactly what it did and now all time highs have been broken.
BEAR11|All these decline here all this sell off is the effect of the kernel virus pandemic COVID-19.
NEUT12|Who cares about that?
NEUT13|Big investors look like they don't care like I always say.
BULL14|Big strong opportunity.
NEUT15|Tesla was trading at a time of $361.00.
BULL16|It went as high almost at $1000.
BULL17|That is a bargain my friend.
NEUT18|This is really, really cheap and that's why price rally all the way from there.
NEUT19|You can use more time frames, even indicators and oscillators to trade on the way up to trade on the way down Trey, smaller timeframes scalping.
NEUT20|Swing trading intraday trading day trading.
NEUT21|OK, you're going to abide by loan as a long term investor.
NEUT22|If you want to own the stock and also take advantage of the dividends and all kind of things or strategies you can use.
NEUT23|Also use options too.
NEUT24|Buy the stalker protected and all that to hedge it.
NEUT25|Multiple ways of trading OK?
NEUT26|So long bias on this one, as simple as that.
NEUT27|I mean there's nothing else you should be looking at, not even on the earnings.
NEUT28|So how Ellen Mosque is behaving in the social media, what he says or it doesn't say what he flips with or not.
NEUT29|You don't care about that.
NEUT30|I mean it should be caring about strong balance is simple as that or any other strategies that support their reaction.
NEUT31|From these imbalances you can trade anything obviously.
NEUT32|There are many strategies that work is just the operator that person behind.
NEUT33|The keyboard pulling the trigger is the one responsible for following the rules, no matter how good a strategy is.
NEUT34|If you are not, you don't have the right mindset and if you break the rules, which is 99% of the trades do.
NEUT35|Then you will not be able to commit yourself to the strategy to your training plan.
NEUT36|Obviously succeed trading.
NEUT37|Remember that this is just a single time frame analysis and a single time frame analysis is not enough to make a trading position.
NEUT38|This is not a signal service, it is not intended to be.
NEUT39|It was never and will never be.
NEUT40|You must know when and when not to place a trade based on your trading plan and only after you pull the analysis into context by doing multiple time frame analysis.
NEUT41|In whatever strategy that you are using, supply and demand is not an exception.
