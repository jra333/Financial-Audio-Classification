BULL0|"""I think you'll see many employees that will continue to work from home."
NEUT1|You'll have many.
NEUT2|They will get back to the office and then you'll have some little.
NEUT3|Do a little bit of both, but I think it will change things like how we think about talent in the future.
BULL4|I think this is given us confidence that we can hire talent anywhere and have them participate productively on teams regardless of their location.
NEUT5|What a conversation with Chuck Robbins Cisco at Gym last night on the quarter and the guy Jim, which on revenue wasn't too bad.
BULL6|No, it's really good.
NEUT7|It's second only to David Dog, which has been the best.
NEUT8|What I would point out is that they are the corporate also known as enterprise zoom.
NEUT9|OK, they have that business locked up.
NEUT10|For instance when you saw Doctor Fouchy talking to Senate that was not zoom.
NEUT11|That was Webex.
BULL12|That business is maybe the strongest of any large companies.
NEUT13|Business line that I've seen because it's the most secure because it's what maybe all the universities are going to use a lot of the big companies are going to use and when you see these banks and where 95% of their people are off site, they use Webex more than they use zoom.
NEUT14|More secure, no servers in China, they are friends.
NEUT15|These two guys in a yeah everyone loves Heroku and who's from from zoom?
BEAR16|But I do think that there is a something going on at Cisco.
NEUT17|It is really tapped into this next generation that we're seeing right now.
NEUT18|Genie out of the bottle.
NEUT19|Work at home next year will be 5G.
BULL20|Very inexpensive stock, 3% yield, fantastic management.
NEUT21|This is one for people who are listening to temper and listen.
BEAR22|Druckenmiller very downbeat.
NEUT23|Yesterday I say is that really expensive and the answer is no no because it's part of the new universe and it's not a hidden stock.
BEAR24|It is big down stock.
NEUT25|Jim, do you?
BEAR26|Are you concerned though about the CapEx cuts that we see time and again from so many corporations hitting overall the ability to bring on services like Cisco has to offer them?
NEUT27|Well I I think that it's becoming.
NEUT28|I think this is what Chuck is really been saying.
NEUT29|It's a necessity they would love frankly not to spend.
NEUT30|But they can't afford it because they don't want to get their workers covid there is look that's the theme.
NEUT31|I mean, that's one of the reasons why people said Jim, you're so worried about kovid the country than eight.
BEAR32|The world is worried about their employees getting covid, so that's why this thing is not stopping.
BULL33|"It's accelerating."""
