NEUT0|"""Hey everybody, it's Jonathan."
NEUT1|So when I'm doing technical analysis, I want simplicity.
NEUT2|I want something that's really, really straightforward.
BEAR3|I personally think people get themselves in a lot of trouble when they have so many different lines in indicators an noise on their chart.
NEUT4|So what I'm always looking to do is I want to find my line in the sand.
NEUT5|I want to find that one level above bullish below bearish.
NEUT6|So let me walk you through whenever I'm doing technical analysis, I always want to use the most amount of data first, so here I'm starting on a weekly of the S&P futures.
NEUT7|This week the low 5275.
NEUT8|It's pretty much the same as the previous week of 50.
NEUT9|If I take it down to a daily.
NEUT10|We can open this area and you can start to see right this area right here.
BEAR11|The markets having a really really tough time with this is a daily chart.
NEUT12|This is a lot of data so for me I'm going to use that one area as my line in the sand and it doesn't have to be to the tick, right?
NEUT13|The market is never going to trade like 5750.
NEUT14|Is the support and if it gets to 5725 or fifty 700 it goes through no.
NEUT15|It's just a guide.
NEUT16|So usually what I want to do is create like a band.
NEUT17|So if this is 57, say between 52 and 57 that band any sustained trade above, I'm bullish.
NEUT18|Because I'm bullish, the equity market, if we stay above this major level, that would also make me bearish volatility, right?
BEAR19|Because when the market goes higher, the VIX goes lower.
NEUT20|It's pretty commonplace.
NEUT21|If this level doesn't hold, I'm no longer going to be bullish at that point.
BEAR22|I'm going to be bearish, and again, I'm going to be bullish volatility because when the market goes down, that's when there is more risk in the market, more uncertainty.
BULL23|The VIX goes higher.
NEUT24|If I'm bullish, the VIX bearish the market, that's when you want to buy options by calls by puts by straddles by debit spreads.
NEUT25|If we're bullish, the market embarrassed avix well.
NEUT26|Covered calls buying stocks, selling upside options.
NEUT27|Trading S&P futures for the long side.
NEUT28|The point is, it's hard enough to figure out if the markets going higher or lower.
BEAR29|What we don't want to do is, I think the markets going to go higher up 10 points, and I think it's going to fall 4 points.
BULL30|And then I think it's going to rally six points.
NEUT31|Then you kind of feel like you're just Seppi with Tokyo, Pinocchio in your in your hand and you're trying to make it the market dance.
NEUT32|Exactly how you think it's going to come on.
NEUT33|The probability of that is very, very slim.
NEUT34|Let's keep it simple.
BEAR35|One line in the sand above bullish below bearish.
NEUT36|But let's not.
BULL37|I think the market is going to rally 10 points and then break four points, then rally 12 points come on.
NEUT38|Put yourself in the best position to succeed.
NEUT39|The best position is going to be through simplification of your entire process.
BULL40|"Hope that helps guys Jonathan Rose active day trader."""
