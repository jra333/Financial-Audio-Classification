NEUT0|"""What's up?"
NEUT1|Traders wanted to make a quick video coming at you dream with stocks were in this stock right now.
BEAR2|We got in on this dip at around $0.55.
NEUT3|So as you can see, there's a channel it's trading in.
NEUT4|You know a channel is arranged so $0.55 to $0.63.
NEUT5|It seems that it can't break, so it goes back to 55 goes back up towards 60.
NEUT6|But you notice it doesn't go down lower this time.
NEUT7|It makes a higher low what when when the stock pulls back and doesn't go below the previous low.
NEUT8|This is what we call a higher a higher low which is very bullish.
NEUT9|So this stock hasn't broken out.
NEUT10|We're going to predict that this stock will break out into this into this range towards the 80s, so but I just wanted to give you a video in a lesson on what it means to retest when things retest.
NEUT11|When things re test and retest and retest his trendline, eventually they break because.
NEUT12|Normally when they test an upper level of range and they don't break through, it breaks down.
BEAR13|So for this to continue to try to breakthrough $0.64 is really bullish.
NEUT14|So again, like subscribe, share and if you have any questions, coaching inquiries, you can email me at greenwoodstocktrading@gmail.com or you can message me on Twitter.
