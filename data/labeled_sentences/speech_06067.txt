NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame if you're not sure what I mean by 30 minute, I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BEAR2|Well, after a very shaky mid afternoon activity here with the price you know made the move up consolidated when sideways there a little bit and then broke down on the downside.
NEUT3|At this point in time, actually, let's just do this so you can see kind of what the chart look like at one point.
BEAR4|At that point, things were looking pretty shaky.
NEUT5|The price is just broken down through that consolidation area, but to give credit where credit is due.
BULL6|You can see the price behaved very nicely recovered back to the upside, so let's get some levels of support and resistance mapped out here.
NEUT7|Headed into Tuesday.
NEUT8|First level of support to watch moving forward and this is what I would definitely call the ideal Weekly one.
NEUT9|Make this chart look the absolute strongest.
NEUT10|Going forward.
NEUT11|That would be if the price can say above 3150.
BEAR12|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 3150, that does not mean the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that.
BULL13|But yeah, if the price could manage the above that level, that would certainly be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT14|Taking a step back and looking at things from a bit bigger picture point of view.
NEUT15|That is where the next level of support comes into play, right here that Pink line, the 200.
NEUT16|Moving average, which is valid.
NEUT17|It let's just call it 3100.
NEUT18|I get it technically 3104, but we'll just call it 3100 and then taking the even bigger step back.
NEUT19|So this definitely pertains to those people that care about, you know the big picture point of view.
NEUT20|But that's where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT21|The 50.
NEUT22|Moving average keyword being moving, so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the overall move, quote unquote, the move being defined as from these lows all the way up to where it is right now.
NEUT23|So the easiest way to gauge the and monitor the health of that movement is just to watch that purple line, meaning as long as the price stays above that line as the line itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the bulls are in full control.
NEUT24|How you must visualize that?
NEUT25|That is what is being represented as far as next potential areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT26|Let me squeeze down the chart here to offer up a bit more.
NEUT27|Perspective, but the next big area of resistance watch going forward and a lot of people are going to be watching it for sure.
NEUT28|Is right up here at 31 at 90.
NEUT29|If you go through the history of the chart you can see 3190 rejected the price rejected.
NEUT30|The price rejected the price so not saying it can't be broken, but just saying there's going to be a lot of eyeballs watching that level.
NEUT31|So keep a close eye on that level and we'll see if the price can get up there and push up through it.
BULL32|But All in all, very nice way to start the week First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT33|Before you go I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT34|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT35|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT36|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL37|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT38|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type of way.
NEUT39|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR40|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT41|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT42|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT43|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT44|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session that is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
