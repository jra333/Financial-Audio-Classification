BEAR0|"""Thursday will find out why att's been such a. I mean like yeah, you don't get an almost 7% yield, was something pretty wrong, right?"
NEUT1|I mean, I call that a red flag.
NEUT2|Now I. Yeah, it might be enough by but I don't.
NEUT3|I still don't want to anticipate it, and let's say it's a great number goes up like a Buck the next day, people start raising numbers.
NEUT4|That's your chance.
BEAR5|Even though we're in a recession.
BEAR6|The railroads have been on fire in a recession, all aboard all aboard, with Union Pacific leading the way.
BEAR7|I'm expecting some decent numbers here, but the stocks went so much.
BEAR8|I think the part might be too high.
NEUT9|If any railroad can meet the expectations so it is you and Pete we hear from CSX the day before this after the close on Wednesday.
BULL10|Now I'm betting Union Pacific does better thanks to its West Coast support exposure and because of its efficiency ratio, you want a wild one that could deliver monster quarter.
NEUT11|Alright, I'll give you a wild one.
NEUT12|It's called tractor supply.
NEUT13|It says everything you need to move to the country, become a gentleman or gentlewoman farmer.
BULL14|Don't laugh, it's one of the most reliable retailers for gardeners everywhere, and gardening is ascendant due to covid.
BULL15|And Canning the stocks of that; The stocks up 50% for the year.
NEUT16|Yeah, track equitis yo what you want is for the stock or any of these that I like to have some exogeneous advantages.
BULL17|Nothing to do with tractor supply that sends the stock down gives you a chance to be able to buy it, but I think it would be great quarter.
NEUT18|What will Twitter say about the hacking?
NEUT19|The lack of sports and movie ads when it reports it's been a disappointment of late?
NEUT20|And I don't know if any upcoming events that can stir interest in less supports can come back and you watch it with sports.
NEUT21|That's what I like to do.
NEUT22|Airline alert if you insist on owning or even trading, it's SW luvr.
NEUT23|That's the best OK bar none.
NEUT24|It's the most profitable and I doubt it will need help from the government.
NEUT25|I can't say the same thing about American Airlines AAL, which reports on the same day.
BEAR26|That's the worst of the bunch at the day.
NEUT27|Traders keep piling into it.
NEUT28|Why?
NEUT29|'cause there is a low dollar amount per share under 12?
NEUT30|Personally, I'd stay away from the ownership, but if for some crazy reason you don't airline, think of Southwest, not American.
NEUT31|After the clothes we have a tale of two semis.
NEUT32|Intel in Skyworks.
NEUT33|Intel seems like it's taking a bit of a step back here.
BEAR34|It's getting clobbered by AMD lately.
BULL35|Skyworks the other hand is a fantastic five GPL.
NEUT36|I expect the blowout plus multiple quarters ahead will still be talking.
BULL37|5G speaking blots were going to get results from Boston Beer, and because of its sparkling Seltzer brand, truly, this might be a very good quarter.
NEUT38|I want you to be careful.
BULL39|Your constellation brands STC is entered the fray with Corona Seltzer.
BEAR40|I don't like going up against them.
BEAR41|They're too good.
