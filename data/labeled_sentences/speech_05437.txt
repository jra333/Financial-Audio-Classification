NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the crude Oil weekly chart, and as you can see pretty weak closing futures were closed on Friday, but we're waiting on OPEC and whether or not they're going to cut."
NEUT1|The.
BULL2|$20 level is massive support if we can break above 30, that's massively bullish.
NEUT3|At this point, you could make an argument for a bullish harami, but you need to break the top of the Mother Candle stick, which is close enough to 30.
NEUT4|That's what I'm using 42.
NEUT5|Between 40 and 42 would be your target.
BEAR6|At that point, I think OPEC needs to cut 20 million barrels to make that happen over here in the Brent market we tried to rally and then we gave up.
NEUT7|So if we broke down below 30, it opens up the door to 25.
NEUT8|Possibly 20 if we can break above the top of the candle stick 40 and then 45 are your targets.
NEUT9|"It's all about the reaction to whatever announcement OPEC finally comes out with."""
