NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol AMZN Amazon."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean.
NEUT3|By 30 minute.
NEUT4|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT5|Well, a very nice.
NEUT6|Late late day.
BULL7|Basically last final hour because you can see right there that candle stick finally got a surge out and got a break of that area of resistance.
NEUT8|So my point here is that there was very nice movement late day which brings about the question.
NEUT9|OK yeah step one is been established.
BULL10|There's been some nice movement.
NEUT11|Step two though is I don't.
NEUT12|Is there any sort of genuine power behind this woman?
NEUT13|Is there any sort of genuine strength or is this just some sort of you know, phony breakout?
NEUT14|You know, one of the typical fake breakout type movements, and I have no idea.
NEUT15|But by using charge we can make answering that question very straightforward.
NEUT16|And in my mind, it all revolves around this area right here at the 3910 Mark.
NEUT17|Now why is 3910 important?
NEUT18|I'm not saying that all of this was going to happen, but just for explanation sake.
NEUT19|If the price were to come down here to 3910, behave in that manner, then continue on down, what would that be doing to the price?
NEUT20|Well, that would quite literally be putting the price right back inside of that range that it just broke out of or set another way.
NEUT21|That would imply that the price has made this very nice move to then go right back to where it was not exactly a sign of genuine strength or true power.
NEUT22|Again, not saying that's what's going to happen, but that is why that level is important.
NEUT23|On the flip side of things though.
NEUT24|Maybe 'cause it will be fair and no pricing.
NEUT25|Go straight up.
NEUT26|So maybe the price comes on here.
NEUT27|Behaves like that and then it works the way back upwards.
NEUT28|What would you have in this situation?
NEUT29|Will not have sudden you have a set of those right there you have these loads down there.
NEUT30|You envision those stair steps and there you go.
NEUT31|Now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT32|And again that's the name of the game.
NEUT33|That's what it truly strong move is going to.
BULL34|Overtime it's going to make progress forward.
NEUT35|So in this situation right there it's all about that 3110 Mark in scene of the pricing step above there.
BULL36|Now in the event the price continues to work higher where some of these levels of resistance at next key battleground to watch very closely going to be up there around.
NEUT37|3380, and then you'll also want to keep an eye on the Purple Line right there, which on my chart denotes the very well known 50.
NEUT38|Moving average current value of that will just call it up at 3400.
NEUT39|But All in all nice.
NEUT40|Breakout late day today on Amazon, so let's see if the price can build upon the momentum moving forward.
NEUT41|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT42|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT43|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL44|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT45|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT46|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR47|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT48|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT49|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT50|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT51|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT52|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
