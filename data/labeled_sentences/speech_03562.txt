NEUT0|"""We're gonna be taking a quick look at Google here that stock ticker symbol GOOG if you never heard of it, Google well not sure where you been hiding, but we'll go ahead and take a look."
NEUT1|I did a post on this one yesterday over the weekend here it was.
NEUT2|Trading is trading at it.
NEUT3|Closed at 789 would be the clothes when I took a look at this I say G OG ready for a pullback and I'll pull up that post real quick so you can see it.
NEUT4|This was from over the weekend.
NEUT5|I posted this on the NASDAQ, different repored over investors hang out, so if you're checking this out, just go up to the top right hand corner of the search screen an you hit the NASDAQ dipper rip this all the big board stocks on this board.
NEUT6|Alot of great people over there so we're going to take a look at Google.
BULL7|Like I said, Geojit ready for a pullback.
NEUT8|You're starting to see it right now.
NEUT9|OK.
NEUT10|I mean like I said I posted this over the weekend.
NEUT11|He got back inside that Lower Bollinger band, but every time it gets outside of it always seems to pull back down to the simple day moving average.
NEUT12|If I zoom out and we're going to look at where it got outside that lower.
NEUT13|The Upper Bollinger Band right here when a little sideways before start pulling back, but didn't really pull back because it went up right.
NEUT14|So let's keep it day to keep an eye on these simple day moving averages.
NEUT15|But over here in the recent I mean you got outside pulled back again outside pulled back right here in the short term few days and pull back again right here.
NEUT16|But when he got through here on October.
NEUT17|And it literally just fell through a 10 day, 20 and 30 and just start dropping down but bounced off that Lower Bollinger band again fell back through, bounced off, fell back through, and bounced off.
NEUT18|So we're going to go here.
NEUT19|I think that I think that Google is going to start probably going to be a self for a few days.
NEUT20|Uh, probably.
BEAR21|I would say tomorrow might be the last day you've got 12344 day rally straight up, literally from the low of 755 hitting the high of 791.
NEUT22|So that's where Google is right now, and Joe.
NEUT23|Did you have anything to add for Google?
NEUT24|Yeah, it's called the alphabet.
NEUT25|OK, thank you alphabet incorporated.
NEUT26|And yes, around the long term.
NEUT27|I mean they have their hands basically and everything and they continue to like you know they're wise about it all too.
NEUT28|I mean when you look at it like what they're doing with their Chromebooks.
NEUT29|I mean in all the schools and everything else on a long term, these guys are going to be around for a very, very long time.
NEUT30|Yeah, yeah, you know I'm saying 'cause you're building up that you know the.
NEUT31|Consumer base where these kids that are in school getting their Chromebooks.
NEUT32|They are familiarizing themselves with it in there obviously going to continue to use their product throughout their, you know.
NEUT33|It you just basically become accustomed to it just like we say like ourselves, when we were in school like I know, we started with Apple.
NEUT34|Man, it took a long time for anybody else to come along, that's for sure, right?
NEUT35|I mean, I look at now.
NEUT36|We were at and I mean.
NEUT37|With with Google.
NEUT38|In Apple, rather.
NEUT39|My first computer was an Apple computer with that big floppy disk, you know, and that's where it started and I remember I was like my kids.
NEUT40|They just sat there and just kept playing with it.
NEUT41|It was a black screen and all you can do is type bunch of numbers, you know, wait for some disc download, then never loaded, because if you drop it on the ground is done you have come a long way since.
NEUT42|"So that is Google Stock, ticker, symbol, GOG Alphabet Inc."""
