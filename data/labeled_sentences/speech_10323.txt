NEUT0|"""I've got to take stock of this sell off here in the premarket."
BEAR1|Jim General take this morning is that the market is now catching up to what we know is been a problem in Europe, and these lockdown restrictions in the UK and France are getting more serious dollar strengthening.
BULL2|Some believe because the situation here is at least better than Europe on a relative basis.
NEUT3|Well, I think we're importing their negativity.
NEUT4|I don't think that it's necessarily going to last, but you certainly can't make any moves to the positive until about 11:00 o'clock when you start seeing their markets.
NEUT5|Peter out now it's one thing it's very frightening when you read what's going on there, because it's it's so obvious that it's a second wave, and it seems more viral.
BEAR6|I don't know whether that's just whether that's true or not, but the number of cases are are certainly daunting, but I want to warn people that if you follow what they're doing and you sell our stocks because of what's happening right now in France, that's going to prove to be something that you might regret.
BEAR7|I was negative going into the bank.
NEUT8|Because they never, ever do what people want.
NEUT9|They always seem to disappoint and David it's gotten to the point now where even the goblins were Morgan studying with Goldman Sachs, which beat by.
NEUT10|I don't know.
BEAR11|80% ignored.
NEUT12|And now today we're working about the Madrid Kovit and Paris Cove.
BEAR13|It doesn't make sense to me, David, I'm at odds with it.
BEAR14|You're at odds with the fact that what I'm sorry that the market should be responding differently to the rising cases.
NEUT15|Or in Europe, yes, I mean we're not Europe.
NEUT16|Right now, but we're still running 55,000 a day at least.
NEUT17|That was the number yesterday.
NEUT18|I haven't looked at what.
NEUT19|That was two days ago.
BEAR20|Yesterday's number I haven't looked at today's we're not exactly know, but it's I mean, unfortunately, it's terribly consistent.
NEUT21|It's not.
NEUT22|People talked about death rate.
NEUT23|Very interesting articles these days since we started talking about Covid long that there's something else besides the death rate that we should worry about.
NEUT24|But what I'm saying is, is that if you dollars at the fundamentals, yeah.
NEUT25|Look at that Goldman quarter.
NEUT26|Study Morgan Stanley strong quarter, Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley will get to also for Sun City or Temple Common equity.
BEAR27|Say again Wells Fargo and Citi were not good.
NEUT28|No JP Morgan was fine, but right now your point.
BEAR29|All the banks go down.
NEUT30|Yeah, it doesn't matter.
NEUT31|I mean Goldman Sachs.
NEUT32|You know you speak to Steve.
NEUT33|Sure?
NEUT34|I mean, he's CFO.
NEUT35|He.
NEUT36|It's rather remarkable quarter and I think when people wonder things that people have to recognize is the amount of the amount of business said is being done with zoom is incredible.
NEUT37|No face to face, just zoom to zoom and it's working.
NEUT38|It's not supposed to, but the expense structure is for a lot of places is better simply because people don't go anywhere.
NEUT39|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT40|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
