NEUT0|"""Hey, it's clean this via video chart on ticker symbol LY FT. We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT3|Will a relatively tricky chart to talk about here because there's a lot of perspective that goes into it.
NEUT4|What do I mean by that?
NEUT5|Well viewer?
NEUT6|Some sort of daytrader, flipper scalp or whatever you wanna call yourself and you bought right there this morning and you wanted to buy and sell within 15 minutes?
NEUT7|Well, then from that angle.
BEAR8|From that perspective, the chart looks really, really bad.
NEUT9|Now if you care about the big picture point of view, I get it from the highs.
BEAR10|There's been a large pullback today, but from the grand scheme of it all the price the still have plenty of opting to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT11|And that's how long term uptrends are constructed.
NEUT12|Just higher base is being put into play over extended periods of time.
NEUT13|And that's going to be the viewpoint that I talk about things from.
NEUT14|So if I sound crazy calling something bullish, my guess would be you probably had more of a day trader type mentality.
NEUT15|Going into all this, and I'm not saying all this what's going to actually happen, but for explanation sake, let's say the price actually pulls back here to the $35 mark.
BEAR16|So price comes down to 35.
NEUT17|Behave in that manner and then start to work way back upwards.
NEUT18|Now emphasis here on big picture from the big picture perspective.
NEUT19|What would you have while you have a set of those here, you'd have Lowe's there.
NEUT20|You'd have those there.
NEUT21|You'd have Lowe's down here, and if you envision each one of those is stair steps, what do you have?
NEUT22|Well, from the big picture, you still very clearly have stereotypes making progress in the upward direction, and that's the name of the game.
NEUT23|That's what it truly strong movies going to overtime.
BULL24|It's going to make progress forward and again, in this situation, quote unquote progress, being defined as $35.
NEUT25|Again, I get it.
NEUT26|If you're a day trader.
NEUT27|And you bought right there, you don't care about these stair steps, but that's why I try to offer a warning that I would be coming from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT28|So yeah, today the price pulled back but stop and think about that word today.
BULL29|As in one day looking at multiple days as we're doing here, you can see the price does still have money right to chip away and build a higher base.
NEUT30|So let's see if the Bulls can get that job done or not moving forward.
NEUT31|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT32|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR37|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you.
NEUT40|How it all works then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT41|That is again totally live.
NEUT42|Even if you can't make the live session, please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT43|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT44|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT45|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
