BULL0|"""Steve Forbes is back with us Steve."
NEUT1|It's clear that the CPAC folks is a conservative outfit.
NEUT2|They've been around for a long time now.
NEUT3|I'm sure you've spoken there before.
BEAR4|They were kind of reluctant towards Donald Trump at the beginning, wondering whether he was going to be conservative enough in his first year.
BULL5|I think they were genuinely pleased with the conservative tendencies of this president, so they had a love fest today.
NEUT6|I think we reason why this speech went for over an hour today.
BEAR7|David was since he's always getting beat up by the mainstream media.
NEUT8|It's nice to go with an audience and closer.
NEUT9|Place like that and get cheered and cheered and cheered.
NEUT10|They loved the judges, deregulation, tax cuts, hitting the lamestream media, some of them call it strong foreign policy so as they would save with them what's not to like?
NEUT11|Yeah, well and you're conservative but you're also business people and some business people are not conservative by the way their liberal business people, but the combination of conservative values and and implementing them in policy and business of very pro business stance because of the fact that he's a businessman.
BEAR12|Those two factors have come together an I think I mean, you know today the market up 340 now it's been down for the for awhile.
BEAR13|Over the past three or four weeks it's dangerous for the president.
BEAR14|Say it's done nothing but go up because it could come down again before it probably will come down again before his first term is over.
NEUT15|But is there anybody else to give credit to for this booming economy right now?
NEUT16|Well, one of the impressive things about what's happened in the past year is deregulation and presidents always talk about it.
NEUT17|But he's his peen as people have followed through on it.
NEUT18|You just look at what's happening.
BULL19|The energy field with the combination of technology in a decade or so, we could be the lowest cost producer of oil in the world.
NEUT20|We're now the largest producer of oil and this is fan unbelievable.
NEUT21|No one would have believed it a few years ago.
NEUT22|You see with the Internet, the Empire striking back, they can't stand with the Federal Communications Commission did and revoking Obama's crazy regulations.
NEUT23|So it's not just rhetoric, they're getting some real stuff done.
NEUT24|Now you do have concerns, you voice them here before about his trade policies and whether he's going to protect us.
BEAR25|He talks, he still talks very tough and indeed we have signed some very bad trade deals in the past.
BEAR26|There have been some poor negotiations.
BEAR27|It wasn't handled well, but are you still as fearful as you were because he hasn't really pushed that as hard as a lot of people had feared he would.
NEUT28|Well, you could almost say, is this a good negotiating tactic?
NEUT29|You speak hard and he believes it.
NEUT30|Then you sit down in the negotiating table and you get more than you would have gone in like a lamb.
NEUT31|So we'll have to see what's going to happen with NAFTA that they have to conclude fairly soon Mexico's got an election coming up.
NEUT32|In a few months for the presidency Canada, they've got.
NEUT33|They want a deal done, so we'll see if they get a deal done.
BULL34|If they get a deal done that way, I think the mark would have a huge sigh relief.
NEUT35|If this thing blows up, watch out now.
NEUT36|If it blows up, how could that happen?
NEUT37|I mean, could everybody the three parties just go to their corners and not come back together and trade it?
BEAR38|All Canada, US and Mexico know they will end up having new arrangements, but it's like upsetting an ecosystem.
BEAR39|Farmers are going to be hurt, a lot of supply chains including in manufacturing and going to be hurt.
BEAR40|So it would be one thing if they walked away and then came back a few days later after they huffed and puffed, but if NAFTA blows up, that's going to be a real blow to the economy into the market.
NEUT41|But if they get a deal boy, just the opposite.
NEUT42|By the way, I'm getting his sense.
NEUT43|If you were to grade this president of the first year beebout and eight minus right in the minus going because of concerns about trade policy.
BEAR44|If I got it right, be plus A minus and I'm a I'm a tough grader.
BEAR45|I'm a tough grader.
NEUT46|The the previous president you couldn't go to camp beyond Z for.
BULL47|Great, so yeah, he's doing pretty well.
NEUT48|Steve Forbes.
BULL49|"Thank you so much."""
