BEAR1|The name Amazon.com the giant retailer online Internet retailer, is that it's a happy Thanksgiving week and it sure did last week was one of the most miserable calendar weeks that Thanksgiving has offered Amazon.
NEUT2|Now that Amazon is pulling back to these massive.
NEUT3|Levels up here.
BEAR4|This was an earnings gap down when they missed their earnings.
BULL5|Then they rallied up here to 2:20 and they have been just taken back to the woodshed and they're going to find support down here at the October lows on Amazon.com.
NEUT6|That was an 822 rather.
NEUT7|It's broke, it's it's it's.
BEAR8|October lows and we have come down to massive critical areas of support right here at this lower trendline, and we do have lower support levels that potentially.
NEUT9|If Amazon breaks this low on 418 or 2011 and that low is 175 thirty seven 175 thirty is 7.
NEUT10|So if we break this kilo area right here that was set.
BEAR11|Which were about to 177.
BEAR12|Ten is another major 822 market low.
NEUT13|Along with the Lowe's over here.
NEUT14|Like I said, it sees Lowe's right over here.
NEUT15|That 11 or that 175 area on that one.
NEUT16|7537 here.
NEUT17|And that's a couple of dollars above it.
NEUT18|If we break it, we stand the test it, and if we break that while Amazon could break down below, there's a 170 area of support.
NEUT19|Amazon.com, Black Friday holiday special trade.
BEAR20|Below the 200 day simple moving averages bear trend reversal.
BEAR21|Amazon, there's an upside volatility trade in Amazon.com.
NEUT22|The numbers are going to come out.
BULL23|We believe they've done extremely well.
BEAR24|We believe that there could be a bounce and entry an an exit.
NEUT25|For a good trade, will be watching the 180 call the 185 called the 190 call, where it broke down will be watching the 175 put where they got key support level will look at below the market at the 170 foot.
BULL26|Should it break these massive massive support levels starting Monday.
BULL27|Once again we believe that Amazon will have some upside at support for a nice trade off the bottoms moving forward.
NEUT28|Amazon.com daily chart extreme self signals.
BEAR29|We are oversold on Amazon.
BEAR30|We can get a little bit more oversold, but in the shorter term where a good upside pop is going to happen, we're getting awfully close to Amazon.com on intraday entry and exit.
NEUT31|What profit management happy Thanksgiving to all and to investors and worldwide participants at SMF.
NEUT32|Look at we do everything live Monday morning will be here and it's all about what the Christmas Holidays mean and what the Thanksgiving meant for Amazon online cells that they do on their website and.
NEUT33|Are they out selling?
NEUT34|People are more shoppers going to online now the smartphone gives him a chance to go straight to online and buy it and beat the price if they can beat the price at the brick and mortar retailer, why not go to Amazon?
BULL35|"We're looking for increased sales this year."""
