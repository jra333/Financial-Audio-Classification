BEAR0|"""Several noted economists and distinguished investors are warning of a stock market crash."
BEAR1|Jim Rogers, who founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros, went apocalyptic when he said a $68 trillion biblical collapse is poised to wipe out millions of Americans.
NEUT2|Marc Faber, Doctor, Doom himself, recently told CNBC that investors are on the Titanic and stocks are about to Indira God.
BEAR3|Tranching drop that would rival the greatest crashes in stock market history.
BEAR4|And the prophetic economist Andrew Smithers warns U.S. stocks are now about 80% overvalued.
NEUT5|Smithers backs up his prediction using a ratio, which proves that the only time in history stocks were this risky was 1929 and 1999, and we all know what happened next.
BEAR6|Stocks fell by 89% and 50%, respectively.
BEAR7|Even the Royal Bank of Scotland says the markets are flashing stress alerts akin to the 2008 crisis.
BEAR8|They told their clients to sell everything because in a crowded home, the exit doors are small.
BEAR9|Blue chip stocks like Apple, Microsoft and IBM, will plunge.
NEUT10|But there is one distinct warning that should send chills down your spine.
NEUT11|That of James Dale Davidson.
NEUT12|Davidson is the famed economist who correctly predicted the collapse of 1999 and 2007.
NEUT13|Davidson now warns there are three key economic indicators screaming sell.
NEUT14|They don't imply that a 50% collapse is looming.
NEUT15|It's already at our doorstep.
NEUT16|And if Davidson calls for a 50% market correction, one should pay heed.
BEAR17|Editors note, American seniors have been worried about our nation's ability to continue to payout Social Security leak reports.
BULL18|Indeed, his predictions have been so accurate, he's been invited to shake hands and counsel the likes of former presidents Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton.
BULL19|And he's had the good fortune to be friend and convene with George Bush senior Steve Forbes, Donald Trump.
NEUT20|Margaret Thatcher, Sir Roger Douglas and even Boris Yeltsin.
NEUT21|They know that when Davidson makes a prediction, he boxed it up true to form in a new controversial video.
NEUT22|Davidson uses 20 unquestionable charts to prove his point that a 50% stock market crashes here.
BEAR23|Most alarming of all is what Davidson says will cause the collapse.
NEUT24|It has nothing to do with the China meltdown Wall Street speculation or even the presidential election.
NEUT25|Instead, it is linked back to a little known economic curse that our Founding Fathers warned our elected officials about.
NEUT26|A curse that was recently triggered and although our future may seem bleak, as Davidson says, there is no need to fall victim to the future.
NEUT27|If you are on the right side of what's ahead, you can seize opportunities that come along once, maybe twice, in a lifetime.
NEUT28|Perhaps most importantly, in this new video presentation, Davidson reveals what he and his family are doing to prepare.
NEUT29|Right now, it's unconventional and even controversial, but proven to work.
NEUT30|While Davidson originally intended the video for a private audience only, he recently decided to take his message public in just a few short months.
NEUT31|His firm has spent over $10 million getting does urgent message out what anonymous viewer wrote.
NEUT32|Davidson uses clear evidence that spells out the looming collapse, and he does it in a simple language that anyone can understand.
NEUT33|"Indeed, Davidson uses a sandcastle, a $5 bill, and straightforward analogies to prove his point."""
