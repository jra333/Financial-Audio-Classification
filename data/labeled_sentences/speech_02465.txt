NEUT0|"""All right, here's a quick one for you."
NEUT1|Looking at Disney Stock now what you have here red bars, which means that Disney opened here and closed here open here and closed here.
NEUT2|An open hearing closed here.
NEUT3|Some of the technical indicators like relative strength.
NEUT4|Will include basically once 2 steps forward, one step back, 2 steps forward, one step back, 2 steps forward one step back so it will have a positive inclination were stick astex.
NEUT5|They it uses were the clothes was in relationship to the open.
BULL6|So even though Disting stock it had traded higher.
NEUT7|OK closed here.
NEUT8|Closed, higher closed higher but but when you look at it it.
NEUT9|These are the.
BEAR10|This is an ominous warning sign.
NEUT11|And so you now have a relation of that.
BULL12|You're going to start seeing Divergent and Stochastics because even though the price of Disney, his clone moved higher, it closed in relationship.
NEUT13|OK, people are giddy and then it can't hold it.
BEAR14|People are giddy and it can't hold it.
BEAR15|People are getting, it can't hold it.
NEUT16|I expect Disney to come back down here now moving into.
BULL17|Tighter range.
NEUT18|Come.
BEAR19|Were narrower pattern here.
NEUT20|Whoops, we need to go to.
NEUT21|Let's see top one unbalanced volume, an lower one, money flow, an dots.
NEUT22|In a one minute bar, OK right it works.
NEUT23|It works OK as you can see, Disney opens here closes here.
NEUT24|Disney opens.
NEUT25|Here closes here.
NEUT26|Disney opens here and closes here OK. And you can begin to see that the little guy unbalanced volume was what I used for the little guy.
BEAR27|They can't handle it anymore.
NEUT28|Even they're getting out even though I mean it's on balance.
NEUT29|Volume prices are going higher yet they don't.
BEAR30|They've had enough, it's just too traumatic.
BEAR31|4:00 AM every morning they start hearing by the other day they beat up, but the stock closed green.
NEUT32|It opens up here and it closes down here, but the stock closed green.
BULL33|It opens up here to an all time high and it closes here and then.
NEUT34|The next day they just like I've had enough and then this is the money flow as prices are rising.
NEUT35|In theory you're supposed to add to the winners.
NEUT36|These people they want to get out because they see it.
BEAR37|So I expect Disney to come down to 114.
NEUT38|I don't expect it to hold.
NEUT39|I still haven't found an answer from anybody yet.
NEUT40|If the NFL, IE cap cap cities ABC slash ESPN.
NEUT41|You know this is Disney.
NEUT42|Disney is a lot more than what we remember in the in the 70s on Sunday night at 6:00 PM.
NEUT43|Or why I buy Old Yeller dog food for the five months my girlfriend has.
NEUT44|But that's here nor there.
NEUT45|So I just wanted to give you a quick shout out.
NEUT46|Will see if this thing is less than a gazillion bite an everyone.
NEUT47|Have a wonderful weekend and keep cool an be true to yourself.
