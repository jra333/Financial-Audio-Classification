NEUT0|"""It's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol FB, Facebook."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day on this one, not only from the price action standpoint, but you look down here at the volume man well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs in this one moving forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some areas of support and then we can talk levels of resistance.
NEUT7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal level.
NEUT8|We never say you won't make this chart look the absolute best going forward, and that would be the price could say up there above 286.
NEUT9|Now don't get me wrong, if the price falls below 286.
NEUT10|I'm not saying the entire charts destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yet the price could manage to actually stay above that level.
BULL11|That would certainly be a fantastic sign of power moving forward.
NEUT12|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT13|That is where the purple line there comes into play.
NEUT14|The 50.
NEUT15|Moving average keyword being moving.
NEUT16|So as time goes by, that line is going to move itself higher and higher, which is very helpful because when it comes to engaging the health of the move that right there would be defined as the move.
NEUT17|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT18|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control and visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what has been presented again.
NEUT20|Yes and above that level would be fantastic, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the Bulls 100%.
NEUT21|Own the chart in terms of areas of resistance.
NEUT22|They just don't matter what do I mean by that?
NEUT23|What matters the most is what the price has been doing and continues to do, and that's that right there.
NEUT24|Just build those higher bases.
NEUT25|Or if you want to vision those stairstep.
NEUT26|So in other words, as long as these stair steps continue to construct themselves in the upward direction, then given enough time, everything else will eventually take care of itself, including breaking levels of resistance.
BULL27|So focus on healthy consolidations.
NEUT28|Focus on just chipping away.
NEUT29|In Billings, higher bases and sit back, and with the overall trend, keep on doing what really it's already been doing.
NEUT30|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar.
NEUT31|Web class training workshop, online event.
NEUT32|Whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT33|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL34|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT35|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT36|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans.
BEAR37|Making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way, this becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT38|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT39|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to way too good to be true, but it's not, and I'll show you how it all works.
