NEUT0|"""Here is a monthly chart on Google and I'm going to give you the monthly readings."
NEUT1|We have a monthly buy signal.
NEUT2|Still let me broaden the chart out for you.
NEUT3|Let's make sure that it's totally in the video format for you.
NEUT4|Basically what we had here is is that we had a monthly January 2010 where they sold it off this indicator down here is called a moving average convergence divergent.
BULL5|That's got a monthly buy signal and we still have it.
BEAR6|And basically this is where the stock had sold up in 08 it came down from 700 to 400 an after it went through its selling.
NEUT7|As I said on the other tape.
BEAR8|We had a $200 bounce.
BEAR9|There in three months, three months down $200 bounce.
NEUT10|Well, this is just a monthly distribution.
BEAR11|This is the 09 trend off the bottoms here.
NEUT12|And basically we're sitting right here on this whole monthly diagonal trendline, and we're basically going to get sold out on the monthly chart, just as I said over here, we are on the weekly.
NEUT13|And on the weekly chart, this is I'm I'm sorry this is a daily chart.
NEUT14|So I'll just show people what a daily chart versus a monthly chart looks like.
NEUT15|I.
NEUT16|Let me draw horizontal trendline.
NEUT17|Clear off.
NEUT18|And this is just a weekly chart.
NEUT19|I just want people to know that.
NEUT20|And basically.
BEAR21|There's the lower end of that breakout at 526.
BEAR22|OK, that would be $100 haircut from the swing high all in the one single month of January.
NEUT23|Well folks.
NEUT24|Let me posit 8 for a second, right back to the weekly chart.
NEUT25|This is the breakout.
NEUT26|That's the feedback that's that support level.
NEUT27|I've already gone over that.
BULL28|We are not overbought, we're going to get sold out on the weekly and we will have a counter trend, just like I showed over here on this monthly chart.
NEUT29|Let me find the monthly chart for you, just like you did here.
NEUT30|He came down and you bounced.
NEUT31|Almost you did bounce.
BEAR32|You bounced $200 off of that low and a three month, so there will be a weekly reversal trend to the four week pullback.
NEUT33|K. 'cause there will be.
NEUT34|That's a 3 minute chart here.
NEUT35|Here's the weekly.
BULL36|You will have a reversal trend back up.
NEUT37|"Soon as we're done being sold out will be buying Google and will be making short term option trades using the call options that are totally deflated and where the big bounce comes in that trade."""
