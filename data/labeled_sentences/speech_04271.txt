NEUT0|"""I'm going to be talking about if Doge coin is a good investment going in rest of 2020, then into 2021 and giving me a price prediction for this coin."
NEUT1|Now I gotta tell you, this is probably like one of the most fun coins to talk about because it's so ridiculous.
NEUT2|Now you can see the mascot for this coin is a Shibu Inu.
NEUT3|OK, that's a Japanese dog.
NEUT4|That's what this whole coin is based off of an you know honestly.
NEUT5|It might seem like this is a joke and it honestly does seem like it's a joke, but I've bought this coin in sold it before.
NEUT6|Now I do want to pull up where it's at right now on Coinmarketcap.
NEUT7|You can see that it's ranked 44th.
NEUT8|It's got, you know, like a 330,000,000 market cap and it's got a pretty big circulating supply, but if we click on the coin real quick here, I just wanted to kind of pull up some of the price history on it so you can see it's obviously under ascent.
NEUT9|That's what the price is right now, so you know.
NEUT10|It's a very cheap coin to buy, but you know price prediction wise.
NEUT11|I've seen some people throw out some crazy price predictions now before we even get into more of this.
NEUT12|I want to play this little clip right here.
NEUT13|This is the actual intro video for it, so let's check out Doge coin.
NEUT14|How old is Paige?
NEUT15|So every time I watch that clip, it just makes me want to go out and buy $10,000 worth of Doge coin.
BEAR16|OK, no, seriously guys, that video is just ridiculous.
NEUT17|Now if you were looking to get doge coin, what's kind of strange is they actually don't have it on Coinbase.
NEUT18|They also don't have it on etoro, but they do have it in Robin Hood, so of all places in Robin Hood currently only allows you to buy, sell, and trade seven different crypto coins.
NEUT19|But for whatever reason, they have doge coin here.
NEUT20|I don't know why, so this is where I bought in sold Doge coin.
NEUT21|And if you guys are not using Robin Hood and want to check them out, I'll have a link in both the description and comments of this video so you can get some bonus money for signing up here.
NEUT22|Now I do have, you know, closest 60,000 my Robin Hood account.
NEUT23|But yeah, doge coin here it is guys.
NEUT24|You can literally buy it on here 0 Commission trading.
NEUT25|So if you buy it doesn't cause anything if you sell it doesn't cost anything and you could flip this coin quite a bit if you wanted to.
NEUT26|On Robin Hood and that's what I've done.
NEUT27|I've never bought this coin in like held on to it for a long time.
NEUT28|I've bought it just to kind of like sell it and flip it quick.
NEUT29|Alright, so now that you know we've kind of talked about Doge coin a little bit and you know basically what this coin is.
NEUT30|You know my price prediction for it.
BEAR31|Is man this is tough.
NEUT32|I gave this some thought.
NEUT33|Best case scenario.
BULL34|I think 2021 will see this coin get up to two cents, maybe 2.25 cents.
NEUT35|So like two and a half cents.
NEUT36|But that's the best guys.
NEUT37|Now I want to finish things off here by playing the rest of this clip.
NEUT38|"If you guys could also smash the like button and let's check it out."""
