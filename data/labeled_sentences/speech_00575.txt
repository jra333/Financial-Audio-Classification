NEUT2|It is 10:49 AM Pacific Standard Time.
NEUT3|Today's date is 3 nineteen 2013 and one of the things that I would like to show you folks of Miami empties Saturday over the training.
BEAR4|We are dead alot of stocks and every one of them that we did in here were overbought levels, Priceline being one every one of these that we did.
NEUT5|Here it is and we said that we were shorting Priceline.
BEAR6|It was a week in topping pattern.
NEUT7|This is the truth.
NEUT8|Here is some Priceline and we went through this over the weekend and I would like to show the wonderful results.
BEAR9|Stock trading analysis, Priceline, Priceline Weekly topping pattern, meaning Priceline was going to come down.
NEUT10|Priceline today has a $22.98 an hour day range.
BEAR11|It is $22.11 off of the highs and this is what happens when they get overbought.
NEUT12|We have the analysis we told everyone.
NEUT13|And it was a short it was overbought.
BEAR14|We've gone straight down parabolic.

NEUT26|We went through all of this over Saturday.
NEUT27|Stock chart reading on Google by the dips.
NEUT28|Google did exactly that will be covering it.
NEUT29|One of the things that I would like to emphasize though.
NEUT30|As far as Priceline goes, here is the $705.00 put that was $8.00 on the loan.
BULL31|They just hit $25 on the high.
NEUT32|These contracts if he had ten of them, you would be up $17,000.
NEUT33|When I told my MMT network and my world wider trade network is that it was time to get on the put side of it because they were at a very high topping resistance level in the volatility.
NEUT34|There's a $22.98 range.
NEUT35|We made 165 loads.
NEUT36|That $705.00 puts are paying big an I am sorry that you couldn't do that, but if you want to learn how to get here and get that money then I would step up to the plate.
NEUT37|And get here right away.
NEUT38|Once again, the analysis on Priceline.
NEUT39|They're all right here.
NEUT40|We went through everything and were being paid for it.
NEUT41|So price line right here.
NEUT42|Priceline, right here.
NEUT43|Done on Saturday, technical analysis trends, education on Priceline.
NEUT44|So why wouldn't you want to get trading capital?
NEUT45|And why wouldn't you want our big market maker orders?
NEUT46|Buying contracts down here at $9?
NEUT47|Look at the huge move and that's what a great short does.
