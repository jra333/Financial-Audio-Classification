NEUT0|"""It's clear in this video chart on ticker symbol ibio we will take a look at the 30 minute time frame."
NEUT1|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT2|I do offer an explanation video at that link, so if you go there I'll explain in detail.
NEUT3|Did this analysis on Friday, so that is where the red and green line annotations are coming from.
NEUT4|But after today's price movement with some updates here be done.
NEUT5|First thing to do is just a little house cleaning.
NEUT6|Get rid of that line up there.
NEUT7|That level is served its purpose for the time being and former presentation standpoint.
NEUT8|I don't want to risk causing clutter and confusion 'cause there's lines every look, so let's try to keep this as clean as possible going forward.
NEUT9|But the first update though that doesn't need to be made comes about based on a foundation rule in charting which states when levels of support are broken and closed below they tend to act as resistance, so going into the day right here at $1.35 was that level of support.
NEUT10|And you could throw this right into a textbook once it was broken.
NEUT11|As a rule states, you would expect it to act as resistance, and that's exactly what played out right there.
NEUT12|So I'm not saying that about 35.
NEUT13|You know that the price can never get back above that area.
NEUT14|I'm just saying it makes sense why the price did struggle at that area, and if there is any sort of attempted bounce bounces back you upside than $1.35 is not going to be that initial level.
NEUT15|That will need to be paid attention to.
BULL16|If the price can get up above $1.35.
NEUT17|Next key area of resistance after that will be up there at that Purple line, which on my chart denotes the very well known 50.
NEUT18|Moving average.
NEUT19|Currently valued at $1.47 as far as levels of support.
NEUT20|Chiari to watch going to be right down here at the Dollar 10 mark nothing fancy behind this.
NEUT21|This is just simply where the you know bears failed to push the price down lower.
BEAR22|Not on one occasion but actually two occasions so two occasions bears got down there but failed to make anymore progress in the bowl.
NEUT23|Step back in so for that reason a lot of people are going to be watching $1.10 after $1.10.
NEUT24|If that level cannot hold up as support for the next key level to keep an eye on would be the gap closed location which sits down there right around the 85 cent mark so.
NEUT25|We'll see what happens, whether the week is young, still four days left, so we'll see how this one continues to play out.
NEUT26|First off, thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT27|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT28|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me to transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total.
BULL29|I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT30|The first key is super weird.
NEUT31|But in a productive type away, the second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use.
NEUT32|But in a cruel way.
BEAR33|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT34|I'll explain it, although including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT35|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not.
NEUT36|And I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT37|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
NEUT38|That is again totally live, even if you can't make the live session.
NEUT39|Please still sign up as it will be recorded and you can go back and watch the replay that I will send you.
NEUT40|Click the image on the screen or click the link down in the description box so you can get the date and time and claim your spot which I should note is limited due to the fact that this truly is a live event.
NEUT41|If you have any questions let me know.
NEUT42|"If not I'll be seeing you soon."""
