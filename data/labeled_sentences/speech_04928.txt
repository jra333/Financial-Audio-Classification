BULL0|"""And the passing of the $2 trillion US stimulus package helped the Australian share market to its first two day winning streak in five weeks."
BULL1|There was a 5.3% surge on the all ords, the market adding 252 points, our dollar rising to back up over 60 US sense to the man who's become our late night news finance favorite.
NEUT2|Yes, you're our favorite.
NEUT3|Scott Phillips from Motley Fool wasn't all we needed was the US to get its act together.
BULL4|Very competent.
NEUT5|Yeah, that's exactly what we did.
BULL6|Need the market were up a little bit.
BULL7|Already going to the last 15 minutes of trade, and that announcement came through just before the Essex closed will make it jumped 2% in the space of a couple of minutes on the back of that news out of the US.
BULL8|And that really was enough to lift spirits.
NEUT9|As you say, the first two day positive you know market performance in five weeks, that's just phenomenal.
BEAR10|It is and to see the dollar over $0.60 again that we haven't seen it for awhile.
NEUT11|Have we now?
BEAR12|The tribe in 5557 says we've been out for quite awhile.
NEUT13|To some degree.
NEUT14|You know.
NEUT15|Whenever there's economic panic globally, money rushes back to the US.
BEAR16|The Australian dollar falls.
NEUT17|We saw it during the GFC.
NEUT18|So yeah, some you know.
NEUT19|Nice to see it happen now up to 60.
NEUT20|Of course.
NEUT21|Don't forget we're not going overseas.
NEUT22|A lower dollar is actually better for our exporters, so it's kind of national pride that has a bit higher but not great news if you're trying to export products from here to the rest of the world, are we getting a guide from US?
NEUT23|Futures on what direction our shares might be heading in tomorrow?
NEUT24|Yeah look, we are a little bit put it.
NEUT25|We don't.
NEUT26|Yesterday of course last or last night our time, the US market at 11 and a half percent.
NEUT27|So that was the expectation.
NEUT28|Quite frankly had the deal not being done today.
NEUT29|Our time in the US would ascend.
NEUT30|USA is created.
BULL31|Overnight tonight it looks like upper 1% as we talk now, so that's a positive.
NEUT32|And again, as you say, a couple in a row is always nice to see.
NEUT33|Really confirmation of the dealer market was expecting we needed to see it.
BULL34|It came through, so that's good news.
NEUT35|Extraordinary number, $2 trillion.
NEUT36|It's amazing when you say it out loud.
NEUT37|What were the standout sectors and shares today on our market?
BULL38|Yeah, lot of big ones and some of the big names to Qantas is up 26% after pay up 33% which is just phenomenal if you think about that, an extra third of its entire market value added today and even the likes of CBA up 9 1/2% interest on the graphic earlier so.
BULL39|You are really good news right across the market.
NEUT40|Hard to find a loser amongst the group.
NEUT41|Very much.
BEAR42|The ones that have been hurt most in the downturn.
NEUT43|Other ones that are going to come back fastest when some of that pool once of those clouds lift OK.
NEUT44|Crystal balling again.
NEUT45|It's hard to green days in a row.
NEUT46|Do you reckon we might have touched the bottom of the market now I wish I wish I knew if I knew I'd I'd be mean I won't be here tomorrow.
NEUT47|Put it that way.
NEUT48|I don't know like I don't know what.
NEUT49|What I think is you know we like to see governments taking really serious action to underpin economic concerns.
NEUT50|We learned that during the GFC.
NEUT51|And you can always reply about individual parts of individual policies.
NEUT52|But governments here and overseas doing the right things to really get in front of this quickly, as they possibly can.
BULL53|That will cheer the markets.
BULL54|Whether this is the low, I don't know, but look better news than not doing anything at all, and certainly cushioning us from what could have been worse had it not been done.
BULL55|So overall, I'm cautiously optimistic.
NEUT56|As always, Scott Phillips remotely full.
BULL57|Thank you for joining us and making it so digestible for us.
BULL58|Very kind, thanks bye good on you.
NEUT59|Our special coronavirus coverage continues right after the break.
BULL60|NSW Health pops up broadside from the Border Force boss over the boss.
BEAR61|"I should say over the Ruby Princess Tabacal and the sick prank by a man on parole that forced a police station into lockdown."""
