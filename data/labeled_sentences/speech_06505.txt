NEUT0|"""Hello, welcome to today's technical analysis."
NEUT1|It's Monday, March 6th.
NEUT2|I'm Celina Nicholas technical analyst exam.com, and today we'll look at the pound versus the Japanese yen on the daily chart.
BEAR3|So GBP JPY is currently down since the days open.
BEAR4|The pair has been mostly trading sideways over the last couple of weeks.
NEUT5|Let's take a look at momentum.
BEAR6|RSI is currently in bearish territory, as it dipped below 50 an.
BEAR7|Also the maqdis below 0 also adding to the bearish bias.
BEAR8|If we look at the current level of the 50 day moving average, it's at 141.54, so it's likely to act as immediate resistance for any upside moves.
BULL9|Bear in mind this point is within an area that provided resistance recently as well an if price moves above this 50 day moving average, we could say that another important resistance comes into view the 144.77 level, which was a two month high reached and January January 27th.
NEUT10|So another important resistance level and then above this.
BULL11|We have the 148.44 level and that was the high from December and this should also be providing resistance.
BEAR12|Looking to the downside, we have support at 138.53.
BEAR13|And that was a low.
NEUT14|Hit in on February 7th.
BULL15|Combined with the 50 day, the 200 day moving average, this should provide an important support for any downside moves and then should this area be breached, we have another support level.
NEUT16|The January 16th low of 136.45 would be I'd next as a support level.
BULL17|Regarding the medium term, the pair recorded a bullish Golden Cross in mid January, so that's when the 50 day crossed above the 200 day moving average.
BEAR18|It's it's known to be a bullish signal subsequent price movement though, does not reinforce this signal at the moment as price action has been taking place between the two moving averages over the last three weeks.
BEAR19|Additionally, the current slope of both moving average it slightly negative slightly to the downside.
BEAR20|So overall, the short term outlook is looking bearish, although the mytchett medium term outlook remains neutral for now.
BULL21|"Thanks so much for watching and have a great day."""
