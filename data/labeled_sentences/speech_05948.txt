NEUT0|"""Hey, my name is Ryan and let's take a look at Shopify."
BULL1|It's up almost 7% to start up the month of September.
NEUT2|However, how long can it continue this run up?
BULL3|It's been up quite a bit since the start of the coronavirus.
NEUT4|Let's take a deeper look at his chart.
NEUT5|Anne, use some technical analysis tools to determine what we can expect next from Shopify.
NEUT6|The reason why Shopify and Walmart were up today was that Walmart announced the launch date of their membership service Walmart Plus.
NEUT7|This is supposed to directly rival Amazon.
NEUT8|The reason why Shopify sends a benefit from this is because they both partnered up back in June.
NEUT9|And part of that agreement was that would allow Shopify merchants to list some of their products on a special sectionofwalmart.com.
BULL10|This will bolster.
BULL11|Walmart's third party marketplace and directly rival that of Amazon.
NEUT12|Let's first take a look at the four hour chart for Shopify.
NEUT13|As you can see, it had a all time high today of 1146.
BULL14|It didn't get rejected too far off that Mark though, so going forward we could see another all time high pretty soon.
NEUT15|If it continues to run.
BULL16|In addition to that, I marked some levels of support.
BULL17|That we've seen, in addition to the level resistance that we have now, the only one due to the all time high being hit.
NEUT18|Taking a look now at the 30 minute time frame for Shopify.
NEUT19|I used a Fibonacci extension here at the swing lawn swing high positions.
NEUT20|That we saw today.
NEUT21|This is your day value, so some of this might be a little off, but it's a good indicator and.
NEUT22|Potentially the only thing that we have going forward with this soon loans in high points.
NEUT23|So with this we get a high value of a 1000.
BULL24|192 potentially is the next level of resistance after the one hard value we see at 1146.
NEUT25|So it's about $50 above this last high of the day.
NEUT26|So if it doesn't break above that, we could see a break into this channel for the next level up.
NEUT27|The next at the 261 level is quite a stretch, but they will be at that $12164 mark.
NEUT28|So.
BULL29|Shopify should continue to keep growing.
NEUT30|I think its base is pretty strong, potentially it's it's high with the rest of the tech, but really right now a lot of the tech is is really extended.
NEUT31|It's not really knowing how much more of those will continue to run Shopify's in a good situation and I would continue with the stock.
NEUT32|It's poised good for the future, so everyone that's long the stock.
NEUT33|Good luck.
