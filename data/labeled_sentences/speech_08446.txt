NEUT0|"""They say we're already living in the future and moving forward."
NEUT1|Cryptocurrencies will play an even bigger role.
NEUT2|This video will discuss one of these cryptocurrencies that is arguably undervalued and has the potential to skyrocket in 2021.
NEUT3|XRP if it's your first time here, I regularly make videos on different cryptocurrencies, stocks and other hot investments, so make sure hit subscribe button for that.
NEUT4|With that being said, let's jump right into the video.
NEUT5|Let's talk money.
NEUT6|If you're not familiar with Ripple or XRP, don't worry.
NEUT7|I got you.
NEUT8|Here is the clear explanation.
NEUT9|Repliers receive more mainstream attention lately, but it's actually been around since 2012.
NEUT10|Is somewhat familiar with Bitcoin, you won't know.
NEUT11|It's decentralized money.
NEUT12|In other words, no bank controls.
NEUT13|Bitcoin.
NEUT14|Ripple works similarly, but also a little different.
NEUT15|Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency intended as a means of payment for goods and services.
NEUT16|While on the other hand, Rip was a payment settling currency exchange permitted system intended for banks and payment networks and English ripples ideas to provide a system for direct transfer of assets.
NEUT17|Things like money, gold, etc that will settle in almost real time as a cheaper, more transparent and a secure alternative transfer system used by banks today.
NEUT18|Bitcoin transaction confirmations take about 10 minutes on average, while SRP transactions only take 5 seconds.
NEUT19|Ripple dozens of blockchain, but instead uses a distributed consensus Ledger using a network of validating servers and crypto tokens.
NEUT20|Call SRP.
NEUT21|Yeah, you heard that correctly.
NEUT22|SRP is the actual cryptocurrency is a token which is used on the Ripple network to facilitate transfers of money between different currencies.
NEUT23|Let's take a look at x-art piece price overtime.
NEUT24|Currently 1X RP token is training for about $0.48.
BEAR25|That is nowhere near its all time high of about $3 that hit back in January of 2018.
NEUT26|Part of the reason why SRP is currently trading so cheap is because of the SEC lawsuit scandal.
NEUT27|In December of 2020, basically the SEC is claiming that SRP cannot sell assets without registering them.
NEUT28|In other words, they're trying to treat SRP as if it was a stock worth security, which in my opinion, is bogus.
NEUT29|I don't see how SEC can win this case.
NEUT30|SRP is clearly a cryptocurrency, not a security.
BEAR31|However, the scare away many investors as a cost SRP to plummet to us last $0.20.
NEUT32|As a quick disclosure, I am not a financial advisor and I'm not giving legal investment advice, but it is fair to say that the uptick of Ripple by major financial institutions is generally considered to be a strong indicator of XRP's future value, and eventually I see the lawsuit being dismissed.
BULL33|I think SRP is a great price right now.
BEAR34|Just a month ago, except he was trained above $0.60 and that was well after the loss of claim.
NEUT35|I'll see SRP going away anytime soon.
BULL36|Most cryptocurrencies have hit new all time highs this year.
BULL37|While we're still ways away from XRP train at $3 again, I think realistically, by this summer SRP can be worth well over $1.00.
NEUT38|What do you think CRPS price will be by the end of 2021?
NEUT39|"Tell me your prediction in the comments section below till next time, peace."""
