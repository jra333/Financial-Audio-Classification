NEUT0|"""Hi, I'm Katrina and I'm the social media manager here at The Motley Fool."
NEUT1|We're here to answer your investing questions and I've got a batch in from Facebook and Twitter.
NEUT2|I'm going to send them down to our analysts who answer them with their foolish opinions.
NEUT3|Melissa from Facebook asks what is the minimum amount of shares to buy in a stock?
NEUT4|Is it better to buy 10 shares of a stock or $100 in shares?
NEUT5|Melissa, great question.
NEUT6|The important thing to remember is there is no minimum for purchasing shares of stock in the stock market.
NEUT7|There are couple things to remember which we'll talk about in a second full co-founder.
NEUT8|Tom Gardner has said that the best time to get started investing was yesterday and the next best time is today.
NEUT9|So it's great that you're thinking about putting capital into the market and letting it ride over the long term to build your savings.
NEUT10|A few things to keep in mind.
NEUT11|Berkshire Hathaway trades right now.
NEUT12|The A class shares of Berkshire trade for over $120,000.
NEUT13|Per share, so a single share Berkshire sets you back over 6 figures, so it's not about the number of shares, it's about how much capital you can put an if you only have $100 or a couple $100, that's OK.
NEUT14|There are a couple of ways to get going even with that small amount.
NEUT15|An important thing to do is make it a habit.
NEUT16|So if you have a couple $100 every month, put it to use.
NEUT17|If you can sock it away in your IR a if your company offers a 401K program, great.
NEUT18|Make sure you utilize those tax sheltered investment vehicles.
NEUT19|And let those build your savings over the long term couple things to keep in mind.
NEUT20|Number one if you're buying stock through discount brokerage, they often have account minimums, so some of them are as low as $500.
NEUT21|Some are higher in the 1000 or 2000 range.
NEUT22|You can check broker.full.com to get more information on what some account minimums might be and whether you would qualify.
NEUT23|Secondly, if you are buying through discount brokerage, you want to keep your trading costs two, 2% or less of your purchase price.
NEUT24|So let's say you have $100.
NEUT25|To invest in a particular stock and your discount broker charges you $10 as a trading Commission, that's 10% of your purchase price.
BEAR26|That's a little high.
NEUT27|We recommend 2% or less, so either find other options for a broker or maybe wait until you have a little bit more money to put into a specific security.
NEUT28|The final thing is you can actually buy shares of stock directly from companies through things called Direct stock purchase programs or dividend reinvestment plans.
NEUT29|These allow you to bypass brokerage commissions.
NEUT30|You can often buy.
NEUT31|Then, in allotments of a single share.
NEUT32|So if you wanted to buy one share of Coca Cola, for example, has one such program, you can buy a single share of Coca Cola and not pay a Commission on it.
NEUT33|You're buying it directly from the company, which is a nice way of getting started for low allotment of money and gets you into the habit of saving reinvesting the dividends and and building wealth over the long term.
NEUT34|And now we want to hear from you.
