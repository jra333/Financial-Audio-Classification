NEUT0|"""Low."
NEUT1|Not everybody will come back to case studies with engineering Rob today we're gonna be talking about Disney and we're going to be starting from November 2019 to May 2020.
NEUT2|So let's go and see what happened and what's happening in this market.
NEUT3|As you guys can see, there is up by 1 signal from engineering rubber on November 2019.
NEUT4|Two months later, on January 2020, there's a cell one signal given by Engineering Robo.
BEAR5|Since the market is not going so well.
NEUT6|So let's say that when when there's a buy one signal you wanted to buy from here by listening engineering robot or you wanted to buy here or here, it's up to you.
NEUT7|But when it comes to cell signal, two months later from this buy signal, when you see the cell signal, you decided to not sell it, you decided to keep it.
BEAR8|Unfortunately, that was a wrong idea because you lost 45% of your profits.
BEAR9|Many comes the cell signal the market drops so much until March 2020.
NEUT10|There is one more health signal over here on February 2020.
NEUT11|Just one month later from it.
NEUT12|But over here I understand that you want to buy from here, but in two months until sell one signal, you didn't make too much profit.
NEUT13|But if you didn't sell it over here.
BEAR14|Unfortunately, like I said, you lost more than 45%.
NEUT15|Off your profits.
BULL16|After this town markets down candles, the market is kind of getting better.
NEUT17|We don't know yet, but we will see there's a buy.
NEUT18|One signal on May 2020 version.
NEUT19|Are we gonna see what's going to be happening after that's?
