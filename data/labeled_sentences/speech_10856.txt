NEUT0|"""Michael Tracy is an independent journalist, meaning he thinks for himself."
BULL1|Unlike most journalists, we're happy to have him join us tonight.
BULL2|Michael, thanks so much for coming up.
NEUT3|So take three steps back which I know you do for a living, and tell us what the Bloomberg campaign means for the country.
NEUT4|Well, here's an interesting way to look at it in just the past few years, Mike Bloomberg has gone out in public and stated that he couldn't win the presidency so he wouldn't even bother trying.
NEUT5|And that was the characterization of his vision of his presidential fortunes, in just the past few years, because what is his actual governing agenda?
NEUT6|Well, it amounts to a kind of hyper corporatize, smug.
NEUT7|Surveillance state cultural liberalism, for which there is absolutely no constituency on a mass scale in the national electorate.
NEUT8|So Bloomberg rightly surmised, stop it, may I stop you there.
NEUT9|I just want to be absolutely clear that you've looked at the numbers and there is no constituency for the kind of politics of the Google Board of Directors.
NEUT10|Like most people don't want that shocking right?
NEUT11|So Bloomberg rightly surmised that he was not going to go an ever win.
NEUT12|The presidency on the strength of his political convictions because they're completely ugly and Despicable.
BEAR13|An alien too much of the country.
NEUT14|So what is he done?
NEUT15|He's had this.
NEUT16|Vociferous focus purely on bashing Donald Trump.
NEUT17|Because there is a constituency for that.
NEUT18|Whatever kind of behemoth data analytics, and polling team that he's assembled correctly relate to him that among older paranoid liberals and some independence, there is widespread.
NEUT19|Just petrification that Donald Trump could win a second term.
NEUT20|So rather than campaigning or even presenting himself to the media or doing anything resembling what the ordinary course of action here would be for a presidential candidate.
NEUT21|Rather than doing any of that, he's just putting together these sleek, kind of cutesy ads.
NEUT22|Going after Trump saying, hey, you know what?
NEUT23|I got billions, I've spent 400,000,000 plus so far.
NEUT24|But that's just chump change for me.
NEUT25|That's basically what my wealth appreciates too.
NEUT26|On a given week or something.
NEUT27|I don't know what the interest increases there exactly, but he saying look I can go after Trump on these petty character logical issues, as if people are confused as to what Trump's personal idiosyncrasy's are at this point.
NEUT28|But there is a constituency out there for that who look at the Democratic field and say, Oh my goodness.
NEUT29|I'm not interested in these internecine debates among the Democrats, you know, I was just in New Hampshire leading up to the primary, and I would talk to a lot of just standard Democrats who did not care about the differences between a Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden.
NEUT30|They just desperately wanted to beat Trump, and Bloomberg recognizes that you think I'm.
NEUT31|Uniquely equipped to beat Trump, I'm going to flood your daily consciousness with these tedious ads that are been market tested.
NEUT32|To, you know, press your emotional buttons and that's what he's doing.
BULL33|It's paying off like you suggested.
BEAR34|This is the most brazen oligarchic intervention in the history of American electoral politics.
NEUT35|And it's not even close.
BEAR36|It's hugely disturbing.
NEUT37|And whether on the right or left, anywhere in between, you should be incredibly.
NEUT38|Alarmed at what's going on here yet?
NEUT39|You're one of the you're one of the only people on the Internet saying this, which tells you how fully corporatized or media has become Michael Tracy.
NEUT40|I hope you will come back on this topic.
BULL41|It's good to see you tonight.
BULL42|"Absolutely thanks, Tucker."""
