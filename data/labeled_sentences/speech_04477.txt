NEUT0|"""Here is Amazon right over here and you can see in here again, it's been in an upward phase that you can see that."
NEUT1|Let's get a little closer.
NEUT2|Look right here as it gets into the FIB extension, it jumps up to 90 right around 9:50, which this FIB extension was 953 and then it pulls back.
BEAR3|It gives up a lot of ground and there it's up less than 3% for the week.
BULL4|Still a good gain on its earnings, but its valuations are really extraordinary high.
NEUT5|Let's take a peek at the daily chart in here and you can see this cycle rhythm that's going on there.
NEUT6|And look at this.
BEAR7|This is a big rejection here today that says to me that that stock is going to come down or retrace further and you could see our projection in there.
NEUT8|So I wanted to give you a peek of what the daily chart look like and how it did reject in this big way.
NEUT9|As you can see from those fib extensions.
NEUT10|"So that's important when you look at that."""
