BULL0|"""Hello and welcome back to stocks with Superman dude."
NEUT1|Oh yeah, Top 100 series going through the top 100 most popular stocks given him a grade from zero to 10 based on 9 different variables and we are going alphabetically.
NEUT2|We're on Pfizer.
NEUT3|PFE is a stock symbol #66 here.
NEUT4|Let's take a look at first.
NEUT5|What do they do?
NEUT6|What do they do there?
NEUT7|A biopharmaceutical company similar to that of Moderna?
NEUT8|They discovered, develop, manufacture, markets, tribute and sell by pharmaceutical products worldwide.
NEUT9|They've been around for a very long time there, responsible for tons of great products.
NEUT10|Have a read if you like, but we like what we see.
NEUT11|Let's take a look at the earnings growth.
BEAR12|There should definitely be some current quarter down 1.3%.
NEUT13|Not surprised, surprising.
NEUT14|Because of the economy and because of the coronavirus.
NEUT15|But at the same time they have a coronavirus vaccine as well as on top of Moderna.
BULL16|So interesting next quarter expected 11 and a half current year up 48% expected next year down.
BULL17|That's curious, very curious, but overall medium numbers good numbers I guess.
NEUT18|I don't know, talk to say, let's look at the price target current stock price, $34 a share.
NEUT19|Target analyst Target $41.00.
NEUT20|This year I do like what I see there.
NEUT21|I do like what I see there.
NEUT22|Let's take a look at the PE ratio if there is one.
NEUT23|I don't think there will be.
BULL24|20.12 That's pretty darn good.
NEUT25|I like what I see there.
NEUT26|OK, the beta .62 that's low risk.
NEUT27|Low risk.
NEUT28|I like what I see there as well.
NEUT29|Let's take a look at the short interest on Pfizer Zero change.
NEUT30|Interesting, OK?
NEUT31|And let's look at the chart.
BEAR32|Taking a look at the long term here, Pfizer has enjoyed playing between 27 bucks a share and about 34 up until July 2018 when it spiked up to a high of 44 and then has since been pretty much down trending here.
NEUT33|Spiked up a little bit, but let's take a closer look here so we get a better feel of what's going on.
NEUT34|Where was the coronavirus?
BEAR35|Right here and then we saw it come down from 36.
NEUT36|All the way down to 26 from the coronavirus start recovery.
BULL37|A little kind of basin recovery here.
NEUT38|Just ring up recently and then I'm this correction and actually more than that, quite substantially more than that has been coming down and this sits at 34 with the support at 3306.
NEUT39|That's probably where I would look for an entry point.
BULL40|I think it looks pretty good on that level overall.
NEUT41|Canada annadana at 10 I'd given.
NEUT42|I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10 just because the finances weren't where I expected to see them, so we're going to 7 out of 10 here, and Pfizer, let me know what you want to grade it, or what you would great it out at 10 in the comments.
NEUT43|Thank you for watching.
BULL44|I appreciate it.
