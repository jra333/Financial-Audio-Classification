NEUT0|"""Giacomo speaking today."
NEUT1|Thanks for joining and watching this quick video on Grubhub stock.
NEUT2|I've decided to make this video because there's been a lot of news around it.
NEUT3|Actually, a lot of rumors as well.
NEUT4|This is due to the fact that Uber was interested in Grubhub, and Uber wants to.
NEUT5|Acquired this this talk.
NEUT6|In fact, this for a tie, this Vala volatility of the market that we can see there where the price they were the prices jumped up is mainly due to this news.
NEUT7|So based on fundamental analysis we have, we can see an uptrend condition and what I wanted to check if the technical analysis can support the fundamental analysis as usual for any stock, any market, any any, any type of marketing can be stopped.
NEUT8|He can be for Dixie, can be commodity.
NEUT9|Please just always get.
NEUT10|Well informed read news about the stock or whatever you are investing in it in to eat because it is.
NEUT11|Those are your money and please just get confident before investing money or to our two.
NEUT12|Is it because stocks are not always so easy to understand?
NEUT13|That's why it's important to read the law to get a lot of information.
NEUT14|Get a lot of news and not just use technical analysis.
NEUT15|Technical analysis is only one one tool to understand the price movement in fact.
NEUT16|Base now I'm taking analysis.
NEUT17|The prices are moving upward, so theoretically they should keep moving upward, but based on fundamentals as well.
BULL18|There is this good news that the price came over pulled.
NEUT19|So the idea that the back there is both of them both analysis there suggesting that the prices might go up, so perhaps this is a good signal to buy but just wait there a signal to buy because the prices perhaps carry trees a little bit and then it can go up again.
NEUT20|Donnelly problem is that perhaps.
NEUT21|First of all, the first problem we are, we are assuming that the Uber is going to acquire Grab Hub.
NEUT22|If it's not going to happen, perhaps the price is going to jump down and then they can go to the same level that it was before the virus software and $60.00 per share or the other option is that those prices have already taken in account the news about Uber, so perhaps tenagra jumper much more higher because generally one of the principle of technical analysis that whatever happens around us.
BEAR23|It's already discounted in the prices.
NEUT24|In other words, the prices already know.
NEUT25|Already showing already, the price is already show what is happening around us.
NEUT26|So what is happening around us?
NEUT27|So this is the reason why these prices jump and up so up to more than $64 because of the news of Uber so.
NEUT28|So that's also perhaps those prices already can take in account the acquisition of Uber with acquisition of Grab by Uber.
NEUT29|It's not always like that.
NEUT30|I don't think this is the case, but those are the worst case scenario.
NEUT31|We need to consider so we're expecting those price to jump up and then perhaps we see no, it's not.
NEUT32|It's not gonna happen because perhaps this one.
NEUT33|This news is already been taken account by the prices, so that's all from my side.
NEUT34|The other point taken, account perhaps when when the prices are going so fast, speeding up so fast, perhaps they can pull so little bit so they can start moving sideways before resuming its uptrend.
NEUT35|So perhaps what we can see there is a side wait and before going up word.
NEUT36|"Thanks bye."""
