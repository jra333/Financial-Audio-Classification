NEUT1|Stick around if you want to know more about my system and this company.
NEUT2|Hello everyone, I am then I'm a finance PhD student who got lucky to accidentally discover a very interesting stock trading system which allows me to pick stocks with about 80% certainty.
NEUT3|And I've been sharing those peaks here on the on this channel and I will be sharing them in the foreseeable future.
NEUT4|However, I am not a financial advisor and I cannot give you any financial or investment advice, so therefore this video is only for entertainment and educational purposes.
NEUT5|So today's company is 5 below and its ticker symbol is 5 FIVE.
NEUT6|And which is a US chain of specialty discount stores?
NEUT7|And they sell products.
NEUT8|Under $5, let's quickly have a look at its Yahoo Finance page.
NEUT9|So the company's ticket is 5.
BULL10|So as you can see today it's doing good.
BULL11|It went up by about 2%.
NEUT12|So now let's have a look at its performance for the last month, so so it's almost flat, so it.
BULL13|It went up less than a percent.
BULL14|Comparing with the result of February 16th.
BULL15|Let's have a look at its performance during the last year, so it went actually up.
BULL16|By about four times less than four times, but it's still very good.
NEUT17|Now let's have a look at its earnings performance.
BULL18|So it managed to beat its earnings forecasts three times out of four.
NEUT19|Once they missed it in second quarter of 2020, and which is totally clear.
NEUT20|Why because of the.
NEUT21|Load done everything, so which is ready.
BULL22|OK and I think that they're going to beat their earnings announcement this quarter also.
NEUT23|So let's see.
NEUT24|As usual, my system recommends buying this stock today right before the close, meaning that some somewhere between 3:55 PM to 4:00 PM and keep it for one day and sell it tomorrow at the same time, if the stock prices are going to go up, and if they are not going to go up, then we need to keep it for two more days and sell it the next day after the announcement.
NEUT25|At the same time from 3:55 PM to 4:00 PM.
NEUT26|So, and I think that's it for today.
