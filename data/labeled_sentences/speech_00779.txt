NEUT2|Thank you.
BULL3|Hi everyone, had here.
NEUT4|Just wanted to talk about Darius.
NEUT5|Went to stock trade and the stock investment.
NEUT6|Now for the most part when you're dealing with micro cap stocks penny stocks.
NEUT7|Most of the time a penny stock is just a trade.
NEUT8|Now the definition of a trade is something that a trader, a stock well and see where it gets confusing with garbage.
NEUT9|But someone that buys or sells stock.
NEUT10|If there is stock trader.
NEUT11|More than likely a trader is going to get in to stock quickly.
NEUT12|And then they're going to exit their position quickly.
NEUT13|A trader seldom holds a stock for an extended period of time.
NEUT14|They may, they may hold it for a few minutes.
NEUT15|They may hold it for a few hours.
NEUT16|They may hold it for a few days.
NEUT17|But for a stock trader to hold a position within a within a microcap stock for for more than a few days is typically unheard of and less.
NEUT18|What was initially a trade because of news, positive news and or other verifiable conditions.
NEUT19|Now it turns into an investment and there are some that do that, but it's very rare.
NEUT20|Now stock investment.
NEUT21|Is something long term typically an investment?
NEUT22|Stock is not something that's found within the over the counter markets, and if it is.
NEUT23|It's probably found within the upper tier of the over counter markets.
NEUT24|Would be would be highly unlikely to find a a pink sheet which is the bottom of the barrel in the OTC markets.
NEUT25|Deemed a an investment stock.
NEUT26|So typically your investment stocks, those are your big board stocks.
NEUT27|New York Stock exchange, NASDAQ, American Stock Exchange, etc.
NEUT28|And those are investments and you got your mutual funds and you got your.
NEUT29|Well, the list goes on long term thing, so a stock a stock to someone trades.
NEUT30|It's quick flip and you're likely going to get into another position.
NEUT31|A stock is an investment is something that someone may sit on for 1015 years, whatever.
NEUT32|Maybe buy another car.
NEUT33|Maybe sell the stock to buy another vacation home.
NEUT34|Maybe sell the stock to buy another boat, whatever the the the person's individual goals.
NEUT35|Maybe for that investment.
NEUT36|Once that investment reaches whatever level, then they can get, you know, get their toys so.
NEUT37|That's about it.
NEUT38|Nothing too complex stock.
