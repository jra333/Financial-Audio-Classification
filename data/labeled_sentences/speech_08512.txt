NEUT0|"""Hey, it's playing this via video chart on ticker symbol ZN."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
NEUT4|Quite the eventful day in this one, not only from the price action point of view, but you look down here at the volume in well above average volume on the day.
NEUT5|So let eyeballs on this one going forward.
NEUT6|So let's map out some levels of support and then we can talk areas of resistance.
BULL7|So the first level of support is what I would call the ideal of a clay would make this chart look the absolute strongest going forward, and that would be the price could say up there above $0.23.
NEUT8|I don't get me wrong.
BULL9|If the price falls below 23, I'm not saying the entire chart is destroyed or ruined or anything like that, but yeah, if the price could manage a step above that level, that would definitely be a great sign of power moving forward.
NEUT10|Taking a step back and look at all this from the bigger picture point of view.
NEUT11|That is where the purple line comes into play.
NEUT12|The 50.
NEUT13|Simple moving average keyword being moving so as time goes by that line is going to move itself higher and higher.
NEUT14|So a very straightforward way to gauge the health of the move.
NEUT15|That right there, being defined as the move.
NEUT16|Just watch a purple line.
NEUT17|As long as the price stays above that line as align itself moves higher and higher than the Bulls run full health, the Bulls are in full control.
NEUT18|Everything must visualize that.
NEUT19|That is what is being represented again.
NEUT20|Yeah, staying above that purple line would be great, but from the grand scheme of it all, as long as the price is above that purple line, the bowls 100% owned the chart as far as levels of resistance are concerned in the very near term first key level right there at 26 and then after 26.
NEUT21|Next key overall level going to be right up there at the 28 cent mark.
NEUT22|So 26 and 28.
NEUT23|Two next big hurdles to watch going into next week.
NEUT24|But anyway, look at it.
BULL25|Great volume today.
BULL26|Great price movement and not just a question of can the price continue to build upon this momentum going forward.
NEUT27|Let's see what happens.
NEUT28|First off thanks so much for watching the entire video real quick.
NEUT29|Before you go, I want to invite you to a live webinar, web class, training workshop, online event, whatever you want to call it, but it will be me.
NEUT30|Live revealing to you what I discovered that has allowed me.
BULL31|To transform myself from being an employee to being my own boss, including how I had only one losing day out of 73 days in total, I'm going to cover 3 keys that have helped me unlock profitable consistency within the markets.
NEUT32|The first key is super weird, but in a productive type away.
NEUT33|The second key is super awesome because it quite literally is wired into our DNA as humans, making it very easy to use, but in a cruel way.
BEAR34|This becomes a pitfall for many traders.
NEUT35|I'll explain it all though.
NEUT36|Including how to avoid the pitfall that it creates for some.
NEUT37|And yeah, the third key when you hear it sounds way to get way too good to be true, but it's not and I'll show you how it all works.
NEUT38|Then at the end I open it up for a question and answer session.
