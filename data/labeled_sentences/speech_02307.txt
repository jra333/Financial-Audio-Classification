NEUT0|"""Stephanie, we given Nobel Prize for we got like three of am out to three different economists every year an yet the debate still rages about whether money is treated better in the public sector or the private sector, and an nobody is getting closer to the others viewpoint on this."
BULL1|And I would just say if it just endless stimulus, more and more spending always would result in higher GDP and better growth and higher stock prices.
NEUT2|It just seems like.
NEUT3|That being, this is an absurdist argument, but but why not just spend as much as you?
NEUT4|But why don't give everyone 50 grand instead of two grand in just spend all of that and everything is going to be fine in the economy.
NEUT5|Just will rocket in the in the stock market will be at 100,000, but we know that the growth and wealth is generated by the private sector and it's just spent by the public sector.
NEUT6|OK, well look let's let's talk about what causes the economy to grow right.
NEUT7|It's spending so we can make spending the enemy of you know prosperity because GDP is nothing more than a measure of total spending in the economy.
NEUT8|And you know, quite frankly, cash registers don't discriminate, they don't discriminate a public spent dollar from a privately spent dollar.
NEUT9|The point is capitalism runs on sales right?
NEUT10|So whether it's the private sector or the public sector generating the spending that leads to someone else having.
NEUT11|Income that then you get a multiplier effect and more robust economic recovery.
BEAR12|The reality is that right now the private sector is spending less.
NEUT13|Why because of the pandemic?
BEAR14|Because consumers are cutting back and when consumers cut back, businesses lose out on customers, so their revenue goes down so their profit goes down so government can come in and backfill some of that lost spending and help to support the economy.
BEAR15|At some point the recovery will take hold and it will be appropriate to withdraw the fiscal support so it isn't a permanent.
BULL16|Increase in large deficits.
NEUT17|It's temporary and it's there to help lay a foundation for a sustainable recovery.
NEUT18|Grover the argument that the other side would make, is that sooner or later interest rates rise based on the amount of money that we borrowed and that that becomes a permanent sort of governor on any decent growth.
NEUT19|But an is what holds things down because you spent too much.
NEUT20|Is that what but rates are so low?
NEUT21|That doesn't seem to be that.
NEUT22|You know that doesn't seem to be the issue right now that debt is out there and it continues, and those rates will go back up again.
BEAR23|An inflation will come back if this continues again.
BULL24|We've lived through this with Carter.
NEUT25|We've tried these policies before.
NEUT26|They didn't work.
NEUT27|I would suggest that the arguer that spending money creates wealth Greece.
NEUT28|Italy.
NEUT29|Argentina these are all should be wealthy wealthy countries if that economic theory made any sense at all.
NEUT30|I don't mean off.
NEUT31|By little, I mean if it made any sense at all, it doesn't.
NEUT32|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT33|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
