BULL0|"""My doc back with you unusual what you got."
NEUT1|Alright Scott, you and I were just talking about Twitter an I said how snap had been eating their lunch because they've got over 200 and some odd million daily.
NEUT2|Active users now take a look.
NEUT3|Scott at next week expiration March 5th expiration.
BEAR4|They're buying calls up at the 74 strike Scott.
NEUT5|That would be amazing to see it surged through that right now they bought about 7500 of these calls.
BEAR6|I was back in Snap because of that.
NEUT7|I'd already taken profits a few weeks ago.
NEUT8|Got back in because of this buying and I'll be in those probably for five or six days.
NEUT9|Second one Scott, take a look at what's going on right now in Xanga because I had it again.
BULL10|Just exited a position Inzenga because of some nice performance.
NEUT11|Now they're pulling me back in because they're buying the 11:50 calls that expire March 12th.
NEUT12|So you've got two weeks for these calls to be right and this one's a lot closer to the money stock was I think about 11:20 this morning and they're buying the upside 1150 calls.
NEUT13|Two weeks out, I'll probably be in.
NEUT14|"I'm a week to 10 days, Scott."""
