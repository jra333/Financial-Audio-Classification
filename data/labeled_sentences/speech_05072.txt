NEUT0|"""I want to tell you about some news and it's a very."
NEUT1|It's a cool piece of news.
NEUT2|It's a.
NEUT3|It's an interesting one.
NEUT4|I hope actually other companies when they hear the news will consider this Netflix announcing this morning.
NEUT5|It is moving 2% of its cash Holdings initially up to $100 million from major banks to financial institutions and organizations that directly support black communities.
NEUT6|I wrote about this in Deal book this morning in the company, saying it is in a blog post that this is part of their commitment to racial equality.
NEUT7|They're turning.
BULL8|Their understanding into action and believe the breeding more capital to these communities can make a meaningful difference for the people and businesses in them.
NEUT9|Specifically, though, and this is the This is the interesting part about it.
NEUT10|Netflix planning to hold $35,000,000.00 of its cash.
NEUT11|In 2 vehicles 25,000,000 will be moved to a newly established fund called the Black Economic Development Initiative.
NEUT12|In 10,000,000 in cash will be reallocated to the hope Credit Union in the form of a transformation.
BULL13|O'll deposit now hope credit union estimates this deposit will support financing.
NEUT14|For more than 2500 entrepreneurs, home buyers and consumers of color over the next two years, and we're going to talk all about this at 8:15 Eastern Time.
NEUT15|With the CFO of Netflix, Spencer Neumann and the director of recruiting who came up with this idea, Aaron Mitchell and wrote that blog post guys.
NEUT16|But you know, Robert Smith came out with this idea that all companies should be part of a sort of corporate reparations by giving 2% of their profits over 10 years.
NEUT17|That that's philanthropy.
NEUT18|This is actually a commercial opportunity to affectively.
NEUT19|Move money, just cash that's lying around from some of the bigger banks to smaller community banks that serve black communities and by default if you get that money in those hands, they're going to lend it out.
NEUT20|And so you really can create new opportunities.
NEUT21|It's completely commercial.
NEUT22|There's no get the same interest rates, sometimes even better in certain cases, but it's an interesting commercial opportunity to put peoples mouth money where their mouth is.
NEUT23|If you will, given all the conversations we've been having.
NEUT24|Across this country about this issue.
BULL25|Over the past several weeks, it's a 1500.
NEUT26|Eight 15815 your back.
NEUT27|Andrew.
NEUT28|What is the hope credit union related to John O'Brien and anyway?
NEUT29|I don't believe it is.
NEUT30|I don't believe it's a religion.
NEUT31|John Hope Bryant's problem.
NEUT32|That's a different one but but but the concept is, you know.
NEUT33|I mean, John O'Brien's been trying to help people's credit scores, especially in hard hit communities for years.
NEUT34|This is not going to help the credit score, but to some degree just getting that money into the hands of people who are entrepreneurs who haven't had access to capital and the forcing mechanism bank only makes money when they lend out the money.
NEUT35|So if you can get the money.
NEUT36|"Into those communities and force those banks to lend it, it becomes very interesting very quickly, and so you know, I don't think this is so much about Netflix per Southeast, but acting like the fact other companies were to follow it."""
