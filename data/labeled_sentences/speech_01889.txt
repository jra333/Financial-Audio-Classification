BEAR0|"""I'm Mark here with Simon, Leif Ericsson and our stock of the day is 3D systems shares of the company are down over 25% today on the news that it dramatically decreased its EPS guidance for its fourth quarter."
BEAR1|Simon, where is this weakness coming from?
BEAR2|Yeah, so Mark, this was an ugly report.
BEAR3|The market obviously didn't like it down 25% in one day.
BEAR4|The weakness cited was actually in consumer demand and said there was strong demand from their industrial clients, not so much on the consumer side of things.
NEUT5|Even though that is bad, I prefer it that way than the other way around, because you really want to make sure that you take care.
NEUT6|Professional industrial clients and it looked like that was something that three systems was doing.
NEUT7|OK, so you look at the 3D sector these days.
BULL8|It's growing so quickly.
NEUT9|So many companies are entering this area.
BULL10|Is 3 systems still the strongest contender?
NEUT11|So 3D systems is the market Calculator, you know before the drop today they were about $8 billion market cap, which is lofty and they are the leader in this space.
NEUT12|But I think it's actually important to be the leader in this space for a couple of different reasons.
NEUT13|First of all, when you look at the industry's revenue that consolidated revenue, this entire space only about 35% of it is actually coming from the printer sales themselves.
NEUT14|There's another 40% that's coming from the consumable materials.
NEUT15|And then on top of that, another 25% that's coming from service and maintenance.
NEUT16|So it's important to have an installed base across a broad variety of customers, and that's something that three systems does have.
NEUT17|In addition to that, you know, I think that as long as they can keep an eye on their margins and make sure that they're not spreading themselves too thin.
BULL18|I still think they're in good place, right here.
NEUT19|OK, so that being said, even after today's dramatic drop, are you buying?
NEUT20|Is this an opportunity to buy or you just staying away?
NEUT21|Yeah, I think that this is something you really need to widen the lens for.
NEUT22|You know you look at quarterly results.
BEAR23|That's a backward looking metric.
NEUT24|You look at guidance.
BULL25|That's a one year forward metric.
NEUT26|But in the larger scheme of things, I think 3D systems is still being discovered by a lot of the industries that are using it.
NEUT27|Healthcare and energy.
NEUT28|Huge industries that are just not getting a grasp on what this technology can do.
BULL29|So I think if we look far enough out in the future, I do think this is a buying opportunity.
BULL30|You know, again, I think that it's just starting to gain adoption out.
BEAR31|There's still a long way to go and we're still in the early innings for this one.
NEUT32|Alright, definitely something to watch for Simon Erickson.
NEUT33|I'm Mark reef.
NEUT34|That's our stock of the day.
NEUT35|"Will see you tomorrow."""
