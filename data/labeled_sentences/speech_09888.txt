NEUT0|"""It's playing this weird video chart on ticker symbol AAPL, Apple."
NEUT1|We will take a look at the 30 minute time frame.
NEUT2|Not sure what I mean by 30 minute.
NEUT3|I do offer an explanation video at that link.
BULL4|Quite eventful day on this one.
NEUT5|I don't need to say the obvious, but I will anyway just to establish some context, but a very impressive movement when you think about the fact that the price literally closed right there on Wednesday and all of the prices all the way back up there.
NEUT6|Any rational person?
NEUT7|So yeah, that was a very nice move, but that does lead to the more than valid question of.
NEUT8|But is there any sort of true power behind this problem?
NEUT9|And is there any sort of genuine strength?
NEUT10|Or is this just some sort of knee jerk reaction?
NEUT11|Dead cap on site move and I have no idea.
NEUT12|But by using charts we make answering that question very straightforward in my mind or calls on a single area in that area.
NEUT13|Actually, I'll just use this line right here.
NEUT14|Is up here at the 129 mark now?
NEUT15|Why is 129 import and not send it all this was going to actually happen, but just for explanation sake, let's say the price comes down here to 129 behave in that manner, then continues on down.
NEUT16|What would you have at that point?
NEUT17|You would quite literally have the price.
NEUT18|Having gone right back to where it was inside of this big range right here, and I mean not to insult your intelligence.
NEUT19|But price movements like go back to where they were not exactly sound true power to strength or anything like that, but I mean to be fair, no price can just go straight up either, so maybe the price comes down here, behaves in that manner, then starts way back upwards.
NEUT20|Now all of a sudden what you have while you have a set of those right here.
NEUT21|You have that settles down here.
NEUT22|If you envision each one of those as their Subs, well, hey now you have stair steps making progress in the upward direction.
NEUT23|And again, that's the name of the game.
NEUT24|That's what it truly strong move into overtime.
NEUT25|It's going to make progress and again in this situation, quote unquote progress being defined as 129 as far as areas of resistance are concerned.
NEUT26|The Big Battle ground to watch moving forward into Friday can be right up there at the one 3150 mark when you just go through the history of the chart and you can see that area, generally speaking, as just rejected the price, time and time again.
NEUT27|So that'll be a big battle ground on Friday, but all.
BULL28|Very impressive movement today.
BULL29|"Let's see if the price can build up on this momentum moving forward."""
