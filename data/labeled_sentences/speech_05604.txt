NEUT0|"""Indeed, I think they always want more if you give them something else, it's about it's good for me as a macro analysis."
BEAR1|Looking at the performance in terms of that data so far somewhat mixed, there is pressure on economy, but generally there's still a fairly decent economy in terms of slower growth.
BULL2|But still, seeing gainfully tight labor market I said try as well.
NEUT3|So I think correct response rather than being panic by markets into overreacting.
NEUT4|Just because the market feel like it in that sense, so I think.
NEUT5|There's probably still room for disappointment, but we'll see.
NEUT6|I think the upcoming string or data starting from my ** Jobs report all the weight rule will determine.
BEAR7|I think the debate on whether there will be more cuts or in six weeks time, or whether they will be waiting to pour the next one in December, I think will continue to persist over the coming days itself.
NEUT8|We did learn that there were some just centers when it came to the outcome.
NEUT9|Does that mean that policy settings are going to be a little bit more tricky going forward?
NEUT10|Because it wasn't clearly.
BEAR11|Unanimous, all of the Fed voting members didn't want this rate cut.
NEUT12|What's your expectation on where we go?
NEUT13|Or is it really data dependent as you are outlining see data dependent very much it clearly two camps in that site, those that think we should be a lot more proactive.
BEAR14|Certainly many of the central bank around the region here already done that because they really saw their own data coming through as weakening trend export orders coming down itself.
BULL15|USI again somewhat makes so generally some supportive.
NEUT16|Element of economy.
NEUT17|So this is where again is very much data dependent until such point as weight of evidence.
NEUT18|So to say coming to put pressure on the US labor market, price inflation and wage growth etc.
NEUT19|Then there can be a bit more aggressive.
NEUT20|So I think there can be a bit more selective primarily because they had less to cut this time around far far less buffer than 10 years ago.
NEUT21|Absolutely Dan has a question for you, my dad.
BULL22|Hi saying well how are you?
BEAR23|You know there was a lot of political pressure on Jay Powell to cut interest rates here, buddy.
NEUT24|Hazmat just explained the reaction from the president wasn't necessarily that good.
BEAR25|He said that Jay Powell had let him down.
NEUT26|Do you think that his position is safe and how much of an awkward position does that?
NEUT27|Put the Fed in moving forward?
NEUT28|Perhaps that's why I think Jay Powell was somewhat nervous.
BEAR29|And you know, fairly agitated that I think last night itself.
NEUT30|But I think much really will depend on his stance itself.
NEUT31|He cannot be replaced obviously anytime soon, so I think he will write it through.
NEUT32|Ultimately, obviously from President Trump the politician.
BULL33|He's certainly one more rocket fuel being added to the economy at this juncture to continue to keep the fire burning acid, loco reelection as well, but I think he will be able to stand his ground.
NEUT34|Hey everybody, it's Hadley.
