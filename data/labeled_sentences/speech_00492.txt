NEUT0|"""The intrinsic value of Autodesk is range between $8.27 per share and $7.35 per share."
NEUT1|How are these values calculated?
NEUT2|Paying $8.27 per share represents the company's cash for share issued and outstanding.
NEUT3|They have $8.27 in cash and cash equivalents, paying $7.35 per share represents the company's price per share based on its earnings, and I'm sure you can see that this is supposed to be the high end.
BEAR4|However, this value was in fact lower than this value.
BEAR5|Which means that the company has more in cash than they earn per year, which is not good.
NEUT6|So, paying 735 represents the fractional payment.
NEUT7|We'd all have to pay for the company's next 20 years of median historical earnings.
NEUT8|This is a conservative way to value a company which is different from the price journeys ratio, which will take a look at in a second.
NEUT9|But my question is what are they trading at today?
NEUT10|Well, they're currently trading at a large and huge massive price of 262 and 61 cents, which is not justified if you take a look at the price to earnings ratio down here that Google so kindly provides us 160.89 that is incredibly large, which just further abets the conclusion.
NEUT11|Our suspicion that they are overpriced because you know $7.35 versus $262.00.
NEUT12|We're talking factors larger here.
NEUT13|Now I understand Autodesk is a really cool program.
NEUT14|For those of you that don't know, it's it's a software that you know it's like a 3D software.
NEUT15|They offer a suite of range of products that help people create in construction engineering manufacturing.
NEUT16|There's media, animation, Entertainment, Cool Company, but just the price is too big so we have to park their money somewhere else somewhere.
NEUT17|Where are we?
