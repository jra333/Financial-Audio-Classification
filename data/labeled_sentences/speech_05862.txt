NEUT0|"""From FX Empire, this is Chris taking a look at the S&P 500 and you can see that we have a gap just above that we're going to go aiming for."
NEUT1|It does look like we're trying to rally into it, so at this point I think it's a matter of time before the 200 day Ma starts having sellers come in the 3000 level offering.
NEUT2|Resistance as well.
BULL3|So really, at this point, I think that signs of exhaustion probably, or what will be looking forward to sell into probably a little later in the week.
NEUT4|I don't necessarily like being a buyer here.
BEAR5|"I think there's going to be a significant amount of trouble above."""
