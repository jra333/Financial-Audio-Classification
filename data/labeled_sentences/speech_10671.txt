NEUT0|"""Here's the deal guys."
NEUT1|GameStop is a $23 billion company right now that, frankly, even if it were operating, all gears would be worth about five years.
NEUT2|It's 2023 blood.
NEUT3|Let me work with five billion.
NEUT4|So it's actually little like more than four times, but it should be worth AMC was a few days ago.
NEUT5|Adamari Safari, respectable CEO.
NEUT6|We've known for a long time.
NEUT7|He came out and said, you know what, we're not bankrupt.
BULL8|Oh, that's a real reassuring, right?
NEUT9|So it stops at 13 if he just raised another billion.
NEUT10|But in different ways.
NEUT11|Look at what some huge amount data was at 9 billion.
BEAR12|Yeah no, no no.
NEUT13|But yeah, they raised almost a billion I think yeah.
NEUT14|Million yeah he needs to raise about 910 Celsius right?
NEUT15|I mean well, you gotta pay down debt.
NEUT16|Listen, but Jim, I mean.
NEUT17|It's been an interesting, you know, here you are you for years right on mad money and on this show.
NEUT18|You know, we've been trying to inform.
NEUT19|You certainly had been working to inform what you call the retail investor.
NEUT20|I don't now.
NEUT21|You call the regular, the regular person, right?
NEUT22|The merry men 'cause they're different.
NEUT23|This is a different cohort to assert over there.
NEUT24|They're not being there.
NEUT25|Being there very look.
NEUT26|First of all, congratulations to them.
NEUT27|We all wish people were can make as much money and we wish they were making it on Apple.
NEUT28|Or we wish they were making it on Microsoft, but they're making you know companies that the three of us know are actually not doing that well.
NEUT29|I'm not saying that GameStop should ever been as low as where the short sellers were selling it, just.
NEUT30|'cause it obviously you know there was a very smart fire.
NEUT31|Ethan Coen came in, was it the fellow, the You know the guys that yeah Chu is guy started Julie equal out of socket at 8 bucks and he's a bright guy but you know it's it's 138.
NEUT32|You believe that if you were to pull every single member of the Board of Directors right now, right?
NEUT33|Every single member you know every single member would sell it and their families would sell it and their lawyers and their doctors and their dentist in Tapetes would all sell it.
NEUT34|This is in that's what I don't like about this now.
NEUT35|Of course, that's inside information not condoning that, but there isn't anyone who was involved with GameStop in any sort of way, shape, or form.
NEUT36|Who would accept the fact that this company should be at 338?
NEUT37|But then people were buying it because, you know, coral, you see this to the system is broken right now for certain stocks.
NEUT38|For the heavily heavily shorted stocks and people are thinking somehow this is a home run.
NEUT39|Take the home run.
NEUT40|Don't go for the grand plan.
NEUT41|Take the home run you've already won.
NEUT42|You've won the game.
NEUT43|Yeah, you're done.
NEUT44|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT45|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
