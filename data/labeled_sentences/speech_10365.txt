NEUT0|"""A couple of weeks ago I talked about Marathon Petroleum subject, of course, of activism pressure from from Elliott."
NEUT1|Also Deshawn in there as well.
NEUT2|And they do announce earnings this morning and an update on their strategic review, which is got some news involved in it.
BEAR3|But you can see the stock selling off rather sizably.
NEUT4|It was a few weeks ago.
NEUT5|I said likely to immediately initiate a spin of Speedway, continue to review potential divestiture in some fashion in the midstream assets, and Mr. Hammond are the longtime CEO, chairman and CEO expected to.
NEUT6|Step down right happen.
NEUT7|That's what they announced this morning.
NEUT8|I'm just says a retire next year in 2020 there immediately looking for his replacement and the spinning off Speedway.
NEUT9|This is, you know, people who drive a lot, probably know Speedway.
NEUT10|It's sure.
NEUT11|So largest popular.
NEUT12|Yeah, the largest and it will be potentially the largest publicly traded independent.
BEAR13|Gas stations is burning in stores.
NEUT14|Right now.
NEUT15|It's embedded in the company.
NEUT16|It's going to take awhile to get it to to get there.
NEUT17|Perhaps a year or so before it's an independent company, but they're they're saying the value right now within.
NEUT18|Marathon given the multiple that company gets about 10 billion thing does a billion and a half and EBIT da.
BULL19|So they think that it is amongst the best run.
BULL20|With the highest margins, and therefore could Jim Garner perhaps evaluation in the public markets in 15 to $18 billion.
NEUT21|Hence the creation of said value not being seen that way in the markets.
NEUT22|Today they look at the unlocking the value of the midstream business.
NEUT23|You know David?
NEUT24|I don't want a midstream business.
BEAR25|It's a terrible business right now.
NEUT26|Alot of you know, my understanding is that's a lot harder to do in terms of it's.
NEUT27|It's intertwined with the with the other with the other business.
NEUT28|I agree with Marathon.
NEUT29|And very tough to separate.
NEUT30|That is at least what people have been working on looking at this.
BEAR31|Tell me that that's going to be a much tougher separation.
NEUT32|Not that they aren't thinking about it or trying, but it's harder to get done.
NEUT33|Speedway was easier, they built it.
NEUT34|Obviously the Endeavour deal that has deal.
BULL35|They brought it significantly.
NEUT36|I don't want $4 million billion and a half an EBIT da through deals for the most part.
NEUT37|That's an easier in the end.
NEUT38|David, it has something to do with oil and gas, and if it is something doing or guess, I don't want to touch it.
NEUT39|By the way, how Ceramcoat doing with that guy?
NEUT40|That trillion dollar deal.
NEUT41|That's what I really want.
NEUT42|Like a hole in the head, like a Bolt to the head, which is of course why you need beyond meat because you know spare the cows are energies.
BEAR43|The worst sector of the month.
BEAR44|All these talk about blind headlines about a ramco unable to lock up.
NEUT45|Cornerstone investors are we going to learn more on Sunday?
NEUT46|Never response to the to the to the attack they took know Peloton, smile direct ramco in other words stay away stay away ramco would be the most valuable company and get that at all.
NEUT47|6868 billion in profits.
NEUT48|So for example, I get 5% yield.
NEUT49|But you know what BPS 16% yield they can and they didn't increase the dividend.
BEAR50|So the stock got hammered.
BULL51|Would you like a 69% increase in 69% yield with a company that is an honest, terrific company?
NEUT52|Or would you like a black box like a ramco?
NEUT53|Who the heck knows what they're doing?
BEAR54|They're taking a lot of oil out of the ground and selling 10 million barrels.
BULL55|Yeah, yeah, yeah.
NEUT56|Well that's a good thing that it's oil.
NEUT57|"Do no one wants oil."""
