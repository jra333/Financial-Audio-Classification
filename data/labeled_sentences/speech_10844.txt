NEUT0|"""Hello everyone, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|That's a very important stock that can decide the direction of the whole market.
NEUT2|We can see from this daily chart during your stream time it formed a red candle here.
BEAR3|And we can see for this candle is still under the 50 days EMI and also it has make a lower low compared to yesterday.
NEUT4|And regarding the volume the volume is not so high.
BEAR5|Actually it's smaller than yesterday.
NEUT6|So in my opinion.
BEAR7|In the technical pattern is still bearish for Apple.
NEUT8|The most likely case is that it can form a base.
NEUT9|Here is the lower is 110 and if it can keep the price higher than 110 then it's very possible it can form a base here.
NEUT10|If that's the case.
BULL11|After forming this consolidation base, it still have chance to advance again to go up, but if it cannot keep this 110.
BEAR12|It's very likely it will go down further.
BEAR13|If it goes down further, we can see it's already lost.
NEUT14|The support of this level.
BEAR15|The supporting levels here because the diseased.
NEUT16|Consolidation before it go advance so if it lost this supporting level, the next level will be here.
NEUT17|Why is here?
NEUT18|It's just the top of these candles.
NEUT19|So the next level is roughly.
NEUT20|$98.00 so it will be.
BEAR21|Modern 10% for the whole market to drop.
NEUT22|So in my opinion.
BEAR23|It's not a good time to jump in, and it's not a good time to buy stocks when the whole market cannot go study.
BULL24|"Thank you."""
