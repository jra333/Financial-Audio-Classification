NEUT0|"""What's going on?"
NEUT1|Traders welcome back to another video today.
NEUT2|Will be going over the two trades that I traded on Amazon.
NEUT3|OK now to begin with.
BEAR4|I missed the morning session due to I had a flight I just came back from Cancun.
NEUT5|Decided to look at some large cap stocks.
NEUT6|Notice the spy moving to the upside.
NEUT7|And decided to take advantage of the move.
BEAR8|So taking a look on the top right corner, I took a position on Amazon at 2140 Four 88 with a $2.00 stop loss.
BULL9|I it went up.
NEUT10|About a dollar.
BEAR11|No, it went about $3, so almost 2 to one and it started pulling back.
NEUT12|I took my profits, I took.
NEUT13|Two RI was supposed to make four in this trade, which I could have made, but I broke my rules and I paid for it.
NEUT14|I broke my rules and I didn't get the profits that I was supposed to on this trade, so I got out with a 101 on this trade.
NEUT15|A taking a look on the next trade.
NEUT16|I took Amazon at 2150.
NEUT17|Stop loss at.
NEUT18|2148 had a $1.00 stop, but little less than $1.00 stop.
NEUT19|I know just a little over $1.00 stop and it had $1.00 spread at the time of the trade, so I had to take half shares.
NEUT20|Now I could have took a full lot.
NEUT21|But now if it would have touched my stop, I would have gone out for a two or loss, which I would have only.
NEUT22|Had it in my plan a one our loss.
NEUT23|So I.
NEUT24|Took half shares.
NEUT25|I made two to one on this trade.
NEUT26|And then we just moved on I.
BEAR27|Just let my shares ride, it came down.
NEUT28|It took a little bit of my profits and I just called it a day so.
NEUT29|Those were my two trades on Amazon.
