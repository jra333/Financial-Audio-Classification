BULL0|"""Hey guys, how's it going?"
NEUT1|So last night Bob bigger, the CEO of Disney announced some big news about Disney Plus and it's coming out at the end of this year and I'll get it right into all the details.
NEUT2|But before I do go ahead and smash that like button for me and let's get started.
BEAR3|Announced on Thursday at its Investor Day that Disney Plus will be coming out November 12 in the USA for a low price of $6.99 per month.
NEUT4|Or you can pay $69 for the whole year, which will be saving about $14.88.
NEUT5|You know for the whole year if you're paying it.
NEUT6|At once, instead of paying monthly, and isn't he also confirmed that they will have a bunch of like television series and films that are solely available?
NEUT7|You know on Disney Plus for you, so they're going to be putting out a bunch of new content.
NEUT8|Alright, I'm going to go off topic for a second.
BULL9|As of right now as I'm speaking, the market just opened and Disney is up about 11%.
NEUT10|It's trading at $129 per share.
BEAR11|I missed out on my chance last night to get in because market closed and I was going to get some options for 2019 January calls, but I didn't get the chance so I'm not going to do that.
NEUT12|Instead I bought some shares.
BULL13|And I'm still profiting and I think there's going to be a good long term investment.
NEUT14|But now let's get back into the whole video.
NEUT15|Films released in 2019 will also be available on Disney Plus as soon as they are, you know, theatrical and home entertainment windows are like closed pretty much once everything is like done and all the money is made from it.
NEUT16|It's going to be going to be spending about $1 billion in 2020 on original content for you know Disney Plus and around 2 billion by 2024 for the platform you know, while Disney forecasts between about 60 and 90 million subscribers by the end of 2024.
BEAR17|Which in my opinion I feel like that they're really lowballing him, because that's pretty much 4 1/2 years, and they're only going to get many subscribers.
NEUT18|I feel like every family is going to be having Disney plus because little kids love watching that stuff and parents are going to be happy because the kids are going to be watching TV instead of running around and causing trouble.
BULL19|So I think these numbers could be even higher, which will be great for the company and the stock as well.
NEUT20|'cause that you know it might make it even rise of a lot more than that.
NEUT21|Alright, so for this next part I have some notes written down, so I'm going to be reading it off what I wrote.
NEUT22|Pretty much, Disney Plus will have a model brand and also some extra things like 2 unscripted model series.
NEUT23|Pixar will produce a number of short shorts for the subscription service.
NEUT24|Many original series are going to be available as well.
NEUT25|The list goes on and on.
NEUT26|Pretty much National Geographic content will also be, you know it will also be on Disney Plus is going to find a new home with many new shows in all of these categories.
NEUT27|The Simpsons will all be available the first day of launch so you can binge watch all The Simpsons episodes you so you better find some time in your life because.
NEUT28|That's coming.
NEUT29|And to wrap this up, the last thing they announced that all of this content will be available available for download, which I think is huge, because that means you can be offline while you're watching all these shows, and you can just, you know, watch it wherever you want, as long as you have it downloaded on your on your computer, let's say so this is amazing news.
BULL30|So I myself think this is going to be an amazing platform for everybody to enjoy.
BEAR31|And I think it's going to destroy some of its competitors if you know who I'm talking about right now, you can check out actually some of the stocks are going down in the competition.
BULL32|In my opinion, this is a great long term investment.
NEUT33|You know myself I'm going to be investing into it.
NEUT34|I'm actually going to screenshot sometime in this video.
NEUT35|I might have already posted it, but yeah, I'm holding a long term, you know, 2020.
BEAR36|I'm hoping that it's reaching above $160.00 per share, maybe more, but that just went up.
NEUT37|You know my opinion, so don't take anything you know, this is just I'm not a. I'm not a advisor or anything, so I'm just this is just my opinion.
NEUT38|So if you guys you know leave a comment below tell me what you think about Disney.
NEUT39|"Plus make sure you leave me a like and check out all my other videos and I'll see you next time."""
