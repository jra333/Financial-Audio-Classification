BEAR0|"""I am thrilled for you because my biggest fear was again that people would be afraid they want to stay at home if they're staying at home."
NEUT1|They go to, they go to Barstool they I wanted to go to Penn at Barstool I think it would be most exciting thing in the world.
NEUT2|David, are you chopping at the bit to be able to go back and do sports?
NEUT3|Or is this stock stuff fun enough that you don't mind the delay?
NEUT4|I'm enjoying the stock stuff.
NEUT5|You know, my firm DTG.
BULL6|We've made our mark so I wasn't expecting that so it's been fun.
NEUT7|But I'm a sports guy.
NEUT8|I'm a sports bettor.
NEUT9|I want sports back an when it comes back.
NEUT10|That's going to be where my focus is.
NEUT11|But for now I am having fun with the stock game.
NEUT12|As you well know, yes, well, Erica is the the stock book is not as much fun to me as the sports book and I know you know the excitement of sports and I think you also recognized the value of it.
NEUT13|Are you surprised and we're going to get there?
NEUT14|But in this one, but surprised that DraftKings is worth 13 billion.
NEUT15|But somehow pen is worth 4 billion.
NEUT16|Should it be reversed?
NEUT17|It should be reversed.
NEUT18|I think what you'll see is this fall and going into 2021 and 2022 and beyond is we're going to crush it like there's no audience like barstools audience.
NEUT19|There's no fan base like ours.
NEUT20|There's no talent like Dave and Dan Katz and other personalities here and look.
NEUT21|We're going to drive a tremendous amount of value for Penn.
NEUT22|Look at what's happened around their stock, look at what's happening around our brands during the pandemic.
BULL23|Like we are just getting started and I think you're going to see an incredible level of growth not only for Barstool Sports.
NEUT24|But also for the sports book by Eric, do you think that there will be a football season?
