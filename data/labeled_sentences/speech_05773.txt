BEAR0|"""Stock futures are down on worries about Spain."
NEUT1|Alex Skaggs joins us now.
NEUT2|Alex good morning morning.
NEUT3|So what's happening to markets this morning?
NEUT4|And why is Spain really getting people worked up against have taken a turn?
NEUT5|It's funny.
NEUT6|It really seems like everyone kind of turned the risskov this morning.
BEAR7|In a report came out that showed that the European economy contracted.
BULL8|I guess more than people thought and also inflation rose, which is big especially for European central bankers.
NEUT9|Because you know, the more money they pump into the economy.
BEAR10|Yeah, that removes their ability to stimulate with monetary policy really exactly.
NEUT11|And then there's also like you said, the big news on Spain people are talking about a potential Moody's downgrade of their deaths pain.
NEUT12|Yeah, and people are thinking that might yeah, what would be the impact of that?
NEUT13|That would force banks to.
BEAR14|To sell that led to a lot of banks hold Spanish debt and maybe they'd have to dump it.
NEUT15|Or I just think it would be more expensive.
BEAR16|It could become more expensive for Spain to borrow.
NEUT17|And then yeah, I mean investors.
NEUT18|If that downgrade means that it doesn't qualify for their their portfolios anymore, they might have to, just you know, potentially bad news people might be expecting this though, so it might be priced in a little bit.
NEUT19|But still you can tell kind of market wide people are getting worried and with respect to inflation we're also talking.
BEAR20|Europe wide we're seeing more inflation.
BULL21|Yeah, it's across the entire eurozone, OK, and also that we're talking about higher inflation.
BULL22|Yeah, lower lower economic growth across the eurozone, which which really reduces turning.
BULL23|Yeah, nice Ibiza flexibility to do what it wants to do.
NEUT24|I mean will they pull back at any point?
NEUT25|What kind of policy are we seeing from them today and how could it change?
NEUT26|I mean a couple of weeks ago, just now the ECB really really got aggressive on it using their policy and providing stimulus to the economy.
BEAR27|And it's starting to worry people that they might not be able to do as much as they would like to in terms of really putting in cash.
NEUT28|The more I guess you stimulate, the more people get worried about inflation.
BEAR29|So if inflation is starting to show up, you know it could become a concern for the central bank.
NEUT30|Meanwhile, back here in the States and Canada, really.
NEUT31|One company, it's not dead yet.
NEUT32|Research in motion BlackBerry somehow, you know it showed up.
BULL33|It showed up with earnings better than everyone expected.
BULL34|And next thing you know, shares are up more than 50%.
NEUT35|At this point, kind of expecting the death spiral right?
NEUT36|Yeah, so again, it's funny.
NEUT37|I was looking at some analysts research this morning and everyone was talking about how you know, OK, it's not great, but it's not.
BULL38|"It's not as bad as everyone thought, so of course on that shares are just up really high."""
