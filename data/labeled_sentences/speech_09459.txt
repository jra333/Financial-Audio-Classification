NEUT0|"""4 years ago, I tried to live off Bitcoin."
NEUT1|No and failed.
BEAR2|It was too hard to find anyone who accepted it and it was expensive to get a Metro card.
NEUT3|I had to meet a guy at Penn Station, pay him $20 worth of Bitcoin today.
NEUT4|That $20 would be worth 370 bucks.
NEUT5|The $10 salad at a French restaurant, now valued at $185.
NEUT6|But with the digital coin attracting mainstream attention and Tesla starting to accept it as a payment method, I decided to put the cryptocurrency to the test again in 2017.
NEUT7|I couldn't buy coffee directly with Bitcoin, but in 2021 it's possible Starbucks recently rolled out a limited program that allows customers to reload Starbucks cards using backed cash, a platform that can store Bitcoin that's the biggest change.
NEUT8|Third party apps and make it easier to spend Bitcoin, Nordstrom, GameStop, and Lows now accepted through a payment system called Flexxe.
NEUT9|Shoppers can scan a QR code and pay the retailer directly using the cryptocurrency.
NEUT10|According to Flex, a 61% of transactions on the platform.
NEUT11|Are for coffee, tea and other quick service items.
NEUT12|Added bonus no user fees.
NEUT13|What hasn't changed in four years?
NEUT14|The work arounds gift cards that allow access to a wider range of retailers, but they come with costly transaction fees over all the people we spoke to.
NEUT15|Don't view Bitcoin as a way to transact, but a longer term investment.
BULL16|Joining single currency investment seems to hold it.
NEUT17|Or do you plan to use it as friends?
NEUT18|Act like coffee.
NEUT19|For now long term.
NEUT20|And the wild price swings.
NEUT21|Yet another reason why Bitcoin holders told us they do not view it as a currency that could change if the payments industry and companies like PayPal make it easier to transact online with its network of merchants, Brian.
NEUT22|Alright, I got a lot of questions.
NEUT23|We don't have a lot of time.
NEUT24|I mean could we do this with Ethereum with those coin like?
NEUT25|I mean how many can we truly do think at some point except as some kind of asset swap 'cause I won't call it a currency.
NEUT26|So so far of the third party suppliers that allow users to use cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin seems to be top of the list.
NEUT27|Some except Ethereum, but it really is Bitcoin that you're starting to see the industry try to adopt in different ways.
NEUT28|And again it's really PayPal to see if they not only allow users to buy and transact, buy and sell Bitcoin.
NEUT29|But if they also allow.
NEUT30|Users to use that Bitcoin to then buy stuff with their merchants.
NEUT31|That will be key for this industry.
NEUT32|Fascinating piece, you're going to do it again this year with the next time you're right, there will be next time.
NEUT33|Brian, you and I will take to the streets in New York will go buy coffee and eat.
NEUT34|French food will be so much fun.
NEUT35|It's like well do.
NEUT36|It is going to mass or this could be, you know go have a drink.
BULL37|It's going to be fantastic.
NEUT38|I certainly cannot wait.
NEUT39|Will do it with telepathy.
BULL40|At that point Seema Modi look forward to it again.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
