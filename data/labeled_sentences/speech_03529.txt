NEUT0|"""From FX Empire and this is Chris taking a look at the."
NEUT1|Gold market and you can see just kind of all over the place as it is risk on for the day.
BULL2|Everything is awesome again.
NEUT3|There is a test.
BULL4|Eight people have survived this test and it produces some anti bodies so that and probably more importantly, Jerome Powell over the weekend suggesting that he was more than willing to bail out Wall Street as many times as it took well, that's sent stocks into OverDrive as people selling gold.
BULL5|At this point though, I think 1700 still offers plenty of support.
NEUT6|"Look at this pull bank as a gift to buy more on a dip if we break above the top of the candle stick, it's likely we go looking towards 1800, maybe even 2000."""
