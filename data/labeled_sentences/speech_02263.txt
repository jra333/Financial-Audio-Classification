NEUT0|"""We want to look at CVS."
NEUT1|You have a young 10 year old in the other room who's dying.
NEUT2|For some reason in love with CVS, go ahead.
NEUT3|Ball CVS.
NEUT4|Look at CVS.
NEUT5|It was $112.00 back in 2015.
NEUT6|Now it's $68 a share almost half, so it's a $90 billion company.
NEUT7|Wow PE is only 11 guys so check mark their profit margin.
NEUT8|Not so good guys.
NEUT9|So #3 Paul is the revenue growth over the past five years revenue growth last five years one 53178 one 85195 to 56.
NEUT10|Definite check mark.
NEUT11|Phone number for profit growth for CVS.
BEAR12|5.25 point 36.6 random loss 6.6 So check Mark there.
NEUT13|How about Pilling or five number of shares outstanding poo 1.1 to 1.3 they probably issued shares in order to buy.
NEUT14|Aetna is my guess that's probably what they did.
NEUT15|OK, how about Pillar #6 current assets greater than current liabilities ball?
BEAR16|I imagine this is not gonna be good 59 billion in current assets.
NEUT17|62 billion in current liabilities.
NEUT18|You know it's a retail store that's low margin.
NEUT19|They're going to have.
NEUT20|They're not going to be able to cover that very easy.
BULL21|Pillar #7 free cash flow growth 6.27 point 96.16 point 810.4 so the check mark on growth.
NEUT22|What's the average cycle?
NEUT23|S 7 1/2 hours so they're selling for about 12 times, not even 12 times free cash flow.
NEUT24|Not bad at this sheet that I use to determine what I want to pay for a stock.
NEUT25|It goes based on revenue growth.
NEUT26|The revenue growth here is big as you remember because of Aetna acquisition, so we don't know now.
NEUT27|The other thing though is there were years of free cash flow, which in the acquisition wasn't accounted for.
NEUT28|Actually might not be a bad play.
NEUT29|We have Walgreens.
NEUT30|We might want to look at CVS.
NEUT31|So the big thing here is how is Aetna gonna help them generate more cash flow?
NEUT32|Bring people more in the store?
NEUT33|I'm sure a big part of it is to do with bringing people to store when they're there.
NEUT34|They're buying pop.
NEUT35|They're buying chips, they're buying a small gift or buying candy, ETC for getting their film developed.
NEUT36|So either way this isn't bad guys.
NEUT37|the PE is low and they can definitely easy afford the dividend being the market by over 1%, so I'm not opposed to this one.
NEUT38|This is something that do more research on and and get some more information on.
BULL39|"This is good."""
