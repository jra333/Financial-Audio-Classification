NEUT0|"""Certainly feels like a category that lends itself to broad retail investor appeal, and it's an it's something that average retail investor could probably easily get excited about."
NEUT1|There's also been some of these names Tilray in particular that's had a relatively high short interest over about 20%, and so if that's something that's in the crosshairs of of some of these guys, then that would fit the bill it well.
NEUT2|When you take a look at Tillery, though, for instance it's at 50 almost $57 a share right now.
NEUT3|Michael, is there a fundamental argument for it being at $57 a share?
NEUT4|Or higher.
BEAR5|Well, it's raced past our target of $15, which we think is just one five just to_that.
NEUT6|OK, and you know, certainly there's always some wiggle room and adjustments you can make around how you think about it, but I think the real issue is that there's excitement about what appears to be likely change in U.S. Federal law around cannabis, but it's being devoted to the affection for that's been going to these Canadian operators who don't have any presence in the US.
NEUT7|I think that's probably primarily because their US listed on the NYSE or NASDAQ, and so they are readily available and investable.
NEUT8|But if law were to change, they wouldn't have a U.S. business overnight.
BULL9|They would simply even perhaps have the chance to enter the US.
NEUT10|It would depend on what laws change and by how much and what the structure is.
NEUT11|And then of course there's incumbents in the US market already that are the ones that are already here.
NEUT12|Based on the service that we've seen most recently, Michael, which stocks in your view, are the most overvalued.
NEUT13|It's, you know.
NEUT14|Little bit different for each one, but you know we looked at at Canopy last week and actually downgraded that to neutral on a valuation call simply because we saw our 12 times ivita revenues multiple for our target as partly capturing some of the US opportunity.
NEUT15|They are among the Canadians rather unique because they have a conditional deelip on federal permissibility to take over acreage.
NEUT16|One of the US operators, and yet the stock was trading at.
NEUT17|20 or more times EV to sales in 2022, just more than you know, accounting for what could come from some of these US opportunities that we do have visibility on so they're not alone.
NEUT18|But that's one where we said, look, I think there's some retail hype here.
BEAR19|Could keep pushing it further.
NEUT20|Anet has apparently.
NEUT21|But then on a fundamental basis, you know we can't.
NEUT22|We can't stretch our target above where its current trading value was.
NEUT23|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT24|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
