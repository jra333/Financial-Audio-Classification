BEAR0|"""Explain to us So what that fall in oil prices that we've seen."
BEAR1|Of course, down some 20 to 30% or so in the last day.
BEAR2|What that is going to do to the inflationary environment in China, particularly if we see prices remain at these levels.
NEUT3|For oil prices, it directly hits PPI because there is the item for oil and gas, so PPI will directly hit by that item and the other thing is that almost everything needs energy.
NEUT4|For example VI transportation.
BEAR5|So no matter PPI or CPI, they will expect we expect a downward trend in in those items almost every items.
BEAR6|So it will hit the inflation for for a few months.
BEAR7|What I really worried is that there will be a prologue for in energy prices which could bring in deflationary trend and this will be quite damaging for economies that are fragile in recovery from coronavirus.
