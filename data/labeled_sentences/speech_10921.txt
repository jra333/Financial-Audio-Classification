NEUT0|"""Mira, let's take a look at the Apple stock."
NEUT1|We can see here.
NEUT2|It forms a green candle.
BULL3|This green candle is a higher, higher high compared to yesterday and higher low compared with the good news that we have already far from the bottom made here.
NEUT4|So it's already up.
BEAR5|A little bit from the 103, but the bad news that we still have the 20 days yet made above.
NEUT6|So in my opinion is very likely Apple will.
BEAR7|Consolidate a several days here before it can go back up because the downtrend here is so large and the consolidation big.
NEUT8|Is still too short.
NEUT9|So if we checked the volume here, the volume is not.
NEUT10|Great for bounce back, so it's not so supportive.
NEUT11|So in my opinion is still need time to stay.
NEUT12|Study here.
NEUT13|Otherwise it still had possibility to go back.
BULL14|"Thank you."""
