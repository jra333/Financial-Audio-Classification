NEUT0|"""OK, why should someone my Facebook stock once again Facebook, the grand Father of the Internet?"
NEUT1|If you will.
NEUT2|They're looking at 4 to 500,000,000 users, maybe 200,000,000 active users on any given day.
NEUT3|You know, many of you probably reading and watching this are going to use Facebook this afternoon, so it's obvious that it hits a huge audience.
NEUT4|And if you go to Facebook right now and you look at the individual piece parts of that page that makes up your wall, there's not a lot of ads.
NEUT5|There's not a lot of information.
NEUT6|There's a lot of potential, so here's where it gets interesting because you see, we're going to value, you know, the under writers are going to value Facebook at some today's value, but you're going to look forward 1015 years down the road.
NEUT7|And you know Facebook is going to ultimately change and grow, probably become the largest email are on the planet in terms of what people will transfer information back and forth on.
BULL8|So the future potential growth with the stock is still huge.
NEUT9|And yet, they're going to price it in today's terms.
BEAR10|And the good news, as you can see here in a LinkedIn chart, this is linked in the other big one that came out here recently in stock has dropped almost 20% with the decline in the market.
BEAR11|"So if Facebook comes in a heart of a deep downturn in the market, alot of investable beginning a bargain."""
