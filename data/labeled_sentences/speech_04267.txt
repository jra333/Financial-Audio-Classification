NEUT1|Here are the details.
NEUT2|The reason I like Disney so much is because they specialize in both physical and digital entertainment.
NEUT3|About $28 billion of Disney's revenue comes from digital media such as Disney's own Disney.
NEUT4|Plus live TV shows and from some of their other companies that they own.
NEUT5|Some of the companies that Disney owns include Star Wars, Marvel, ESPN, ABC, Hulu and much more.
NEUT6|Another $16 billion of Disney revenue.
BULL7|Come from parks and experiences such as Disney's Disney World and are Disneyland and Investors are happy with this year to date there about 30% up but from Corona virus start to right now they're up 110% from that time.
BULL8|Also, their earnings are showing that they're constantly beating expectations for their earnings per share for the long term.
NEUT9|I would rate Disney stock a 9 out of 10, but I would be waiting for it.
