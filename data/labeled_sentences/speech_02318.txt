NEUT0|"""Democrats versus Republicans who's better for the market well?"
BULL1|In nominal terms, I think that the Democrats are are somewhat better.
NEUT2|You know, there's no question the stock market in nominal terms and SNP turns.
BULL3|The stock market is up significantly over the past four years there have been.
NEUT4|Academic studies that have.
NEUT5|Describe the difference as as much as 11% returns versus 2% returns, but it's actually quite tricky question.
NEUT6|I deal with it a little bit in the book, there are many you know.
NEUT7|Do you mean a Republican president?
NEUT8|You mean a Democratic Congress?
NEUT9|President Reagan.
NEUT10|In 1980 he was running for office.
BULL11|The stock market was up 32%.
BULL12|Do you think it was up 32% because the market was was?
NEUT13|Because they were happy that Jimmy Carter was in office.
NEUT14|I think the market was up because it knew before we did that Jimmy Carter was going to leave.
NEUT15|The recent data using gold as a deflator.
NEUT16|Suggest that Republicans Republican Congress is good for real wealth, although the if you're talking about the Presidency, Clinton, you know, Clinton dominated the presidency during a lot of the time that those numbers were good as well.
NEUT17|So it's giving you a little bit of a mish mosh answer, but I think the Republicans are a little bit better on real wealth accumulation.
NEUT18|So how do we mitigate the baleful effects of Congress?
NEUT19|Well, what should Congress do aside from not me or what should?
NEUT20|What should Congress do so well?
NEUT21|First of all, I think I think that you know, 59% of Americans would would replace every single Member of Congress.
NEUT22|Right now, those are the polls that are out there.
NEUT23|I think in the case of Congress, we gotta go out and get better.
BULL24|Congressman, we ought to be increasing the amount of money that Congress makes it.
NEUT25|I know it's counter counter intuitive, but I'd like to pay Congressman several $1,000,000 a year.
NEUT26|They're making very important decisions.
NEUT27|I want them to get wealthy from their day job.
NEUT28|I don't want them to get wealthy from arranging real estate transactions or finding another issue.
BULL29|"I want them focused on just the good of the country, and if I could get term limits as part of that bargain, even better."""
