NEUT0|"""Hi, this is marketvaluecharts.com well I'm about to tell you a very powerful pattern that's developing right now in the S&P 500 and really all the stock indices for that matter."
NEUT1|Notice right now with this week's bar we have the value bars indicator overlaid on top of traditional price charts and this is what we call a yellow hat doji pattern.
BEAR2|This is very bearish in and of itself.
NEUT3|Combining the virtues or they.
NEUT4|A benefit of candle stick charting with value bars and both of those combined together in a confluence pattern like a yellow had OG paint a bearish picture of what the market is likely to do now to add credibility to this we also have a major resistance line right along here at 1846.
NEUT5|Fifty that is right overhead.
NEUT6|The current price bar last but not least really.
NEUT7|A very compelling addition to this analysis is the falling momentum indicator line.
BEAR8|And in addition to that, the negative histogram value right there in the MQ momentum histogram.
BEAR9|So all of these things together are pointing to a very bearish potential picture.
NEUT10|Now the nice thing about our situation is if we see prices break above the resistance line will have to reevaluate.
NEUT11|OK, now I could poke above there briefly and then head to head below.
NEUT12|So if we do get a breach of the eighteen 46650 resistance line we want to study market action very carefully to see if we see new blind coming into the market.
NEUT13|Or we see prices start to stall out, but either way I'm starting to look for some self signals myself in the S&P 500 market and I would caution you if you're a long term investor to look at what's happening in the stock indices.
NEUT14|Because right now this is a very very bearish pattern and given the fact that it's a weekly pattern, even adds credibility to this analysis.
NEUT15|That's all for this video.
BULL16|"Have a great weekend and thanks for watching."""
