BEAR0|"""Holy smokes, did you see Facebook down over 20% after hours?"
NEUT1|This is insane and Facebook is generally a good company.
BEAR2|They've had affair PE ratio.
NEUT3|I don't see them as overvalued.
BULL4|In fact, I always thought they were undervalued.
NEUT5|And now wow, let's just read what's going on here.
BEAR6|Facebook stock drops more than 20% after warning that revenue growth will take a hit.
BEAR7|Facebook earnings include Nightmare guidance that looped more than 100 billion off its market cap in after hours trading.
NEUT8|Wow, this is just.
NEUT9|Wow, Facebook is evidently not bulletproof.
BEAR10|The social medias behemoth stock lost roughly 1/5 of its value in the extended session Wednesday after its earnings report.
BEAR11|Missed expectations on revenue and showed slowing user growth.
BEAR12|Weak guidance also rattled investors.
BEAR13|Facebook stock dropped about 7% immediately after the earnings report was released, then plummeted to a loss more than 20% as a conference call.
BEAR14|With the analyst progress close to 34 million shares changed hands in the extended session, well above the average volume of 17 million shares for regular trading session over the past month.
NEUT15|Should the losses hold into third.
BEAR16|Says regular session Facebook would lose more than 100 billion in market capitalization and lose the stocks gains for the year thus far as the after hours session wrapped up, Facebook was trading at 173, fifty down 20%.
NEUT17|Oh my goodness, this is a great example of what you should watch out for in the stock market.
NEUT18|This is why you have cash set aside.
NEUT19|I'm not saying that jump in, but opportunities like this come every once in awhile.
BULL20|If you still believe in Facebook fundamentally, you still think they're going to grow their still going to do great.
NEUT21|This could be one of the best buying opportunity.
NEUT22|At the same time, it could be a falling life falling night.
BEAR23|It could keep going down.
NEUT24|We don't know exactly where it's going to go, but all I know is I've been watching Facebook for awhile.
BULL25|There PE ratio seems fair to me.
BULL26|Their financials are doing well just because they're saying that they're going to slow down growth.
BEAR27|I mean, I guess that's a big deal to bring it down 20%.
NEUT28|I still believe in the company long term, and you bet I'm going to be loading up on shares tomorrow.
NEUT29|I love waiting for opportunities like this, just in case a big company like Apple, Microsoft, a big company that you believe in and is probably going to be around in the next decade.
BEAR30|And you see a big drop like this.
NEUT31|This is a great time to buy because Facebook a few months back.
BEAR32|I don't know if you remember there was a whole Cambridge analytical scandal thing about privacy issues and the stock dropped all the way down from like the one high one 80s to one 50s I loaded up at the one 50s and wrote it all the way to the 200 and sold.
BEAR33|And ironically it tanked again now after earnings, which I'm personally thinking about going in.
NEUT34|But but that's what I'm doing.
NEUT35|I'm not suggesting that you should do.
NEUT36|I'm not a financial advisor, I'm just saying what I'm doing.
NEUT37|Wow, I want to know what you guys are doing.
NEUT38|Are you guys buying more shares tomorrow?
NEUT39|Do you think this is a falling knife?
BEAR40|It's just going to keep going down his Facebook done.
NEUT41|This has been the star of Wall Street for the past five years.
NEUT42|Let's let's look at the chart.
NEUT43|Let's just let's pull up a chart right now.
NEUT44|Let's see exactly how Facebook has done all time.
NEUT45|Pull up a chart.
NEUT46|It's just straight up.
NEUT47|Of course, with that you see that hiccup at the end that Cambridge analytical scandal Boom and then back up.
NEUT48|And now who if it holds tomorrow morning?
NEUT49|This could be another opportunity.
NEUT50|Or it could be the start of a ending to a beautiful come.
BULL51|But I believe Facebook is going to keep growing.
NEUT52|Even though they're saying they're saying all this stuff about whatever news, just about.
NEUT53|I'm definitely going to keep watching.
NEUT54|I've had my eye on Facebook, yeah, so let me know what you guys are going to be doing.
NEUT55|Comment down below your thoughts, and this is a great example of why you should always have at least 20% of your portfolio in cash, so you ready to buy when there's blood in the streets.
NEUT56|This is a great example of blood in the streets anyway, just wanted to make this quick video.
BEAR57|This is not a normal video I would make, but Facebook's crazy dropped 20%.
NEUT58|"I had to talk about this piece."""
