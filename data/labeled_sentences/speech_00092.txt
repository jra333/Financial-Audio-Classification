NEUT0|"""Hello, right, let's take a look at the Apple stock we can see from this daily chart."
BULL1|Actually, during the past few months it has formed a AM.
NEUT2|Top.
NEUT3|But is this top the final top for Apple?
NEUT4|Is this the?
NEUT5|Beginning of the big job, let's take a look.
NEUT6|If we check this downtrend we can see actually doing the job.
BEAR7|The volume here is a little bit high compared to normal, but these two red candle is smaller than the candles before them.
BEAR8|And actually, when it dropped to this level.
BULL9|The volume goes up.
NEUT10|Especially this red candle.
NEUT11|The volume is larger than the volume before it, so here is the bottom.
NEUT12|As we can see now.
NEUT13|So the volume up here means somebody is buying in.
NEUT14|So regarding.
NEUT15|Current down trend we can analyze it.
NEUT16|As according to what we say before.
NEUT17|Here, so if during this downtrend.
NEUT18|The.
NEUT19|Institutions is diff.
NEUT20|Edit Distribution, then the volume should go up here.
BEAR21|But actually when it dropped down.
BEAR22|The volume is not too big, it's roughly smaller than normal, especially this several red candles.
NEUT23|The volume is small.
NEUT24|But now we can see.
BULL25|At the low point of the downtrend, the volume has going up, especially here.
BULL26|So this red candle has approached the formal law here.
NEUT27|Which equal the price.
NEUT28|How the last big candle here?
BULL29|So in my opinion, this red candle means some institution buying again because they think the PE and the valuation for the stock has been reasonable.
NEUT30|So it's my opinion, so it's still unlikely for the Apple stock.
NEUT31|"To make up any further drop from here is my opinion, thank you."""
