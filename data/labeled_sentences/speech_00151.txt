NEUT0|"""His search would behave with back with another one is going to get right into it."
NEUT1|You know what?
NEUT2|Like waste.
NEUT3|Nobody time before we do that.
BULL4|This video thumbs up so I can reach more people today.
NEUT5|We touching bases don't or gaining ground that's ticker symbol.
NEUT6|Oh Gee, I we talked about this a few times on the channel will maybe twice and really if we didn't touch bases on this if I touch bases on one marijuana ticker which is the King Tillery.
NEUT7|I just started dealing more with Hillary because until removed.
NEUT8|Test one other marijuana state to move.
NEUT9|They run in Alpha theory to Ray go down.
NEUT10|They will go down just like how I turn people on.
NEUT11|The simply plays off of Bitcoin.
NEUT12|SOS is as a playoff of Bitcoin Bitcoin go up.
NEUT13|It's a wisco Bitcoin go down.
NEUT14|It's always go down.
NEUT15|Same thing with Express and AMC for GameStop.
NEUT16|When game starts go up.
NEUT17|AMC in Express Go when you get what I'm saying and when they go down they go down.
NEUT18|They move with each other.
NEUT19|His secret thing in a sympathy play thing.
NEUT20|They make stars move out for one another, so let's go ahead and get right into it.
NEUT21|Organigram.
BULL22|So basically whatever Tilray doing, that's what's gonna help organic gram to be able to go up in price or gaining ground.
NEUT23|We train at about 3:21 right now in pre market.
BEAR24|So we open at 295, the high was 319, the lowest 288 the 52 year with 645 feet.
BEAR25|Two week lows in 101.
NEUT26|So let's check it out.
NEUT27|Yeah, let's look at the chart.
NEUT28|So if you look back on the one we chart.
NEUT29|We see your March view when the whole market was tank was tanking and we had a nice pool decoration.
BULL30|We see we had a nice deal by opportunity for you to get organic ground at 241 and I always told you always wait for deal by pullback opportunities.
BULL31|241 was awesome bye.
NEUT32|So graduates for the ones they got in and congratulations for the ones that still got in kind of late 'cause you still got a lot of potential to make money.
NEUT33|So at 241 a week ago, that's what we deal too.
NEUT34|So now we're trading at about.
BULL35|We recovered itself quite nicely.
NEUT36|That foot that do we do the 241 and recover fully from that whole deal?
BULL37|We got right back up to our resistance around three 2321.
NEUT38|Now from there, where would do we need a breakthrough?
NEUT39|Our next resistance?
NEUT40|Obviously I need legal.
NEUT41|If you look back on one month chart February 24th at 3:36.
NEUT42|So once you reach 3036 Cent, Organigram can shoot straight up can shoot straight up to around 356 soon as they break 336 he can shoot scheduled around 3:50 range and once you break that 350 range we look on a one month chart.
NEUT43|We going straight to $4.18 around four dollars, $4 for 2430.
NEUT44|Any weapon at range and soon as we break.
NEUT45|Or 18 then will be off to retest the high on February 10th when we hit $6 a share will be able to retest that if we can breakthrough $4.18 cool, you know once we did get over $5, that's when the big boys better be on their radar, the Wall Street, they'll be able to buy their getting this heavy.
NEUT46|So you already know that's all I really got for this video.
NEUT47|Just want to give you a quick Tour de Organigram that China had these stocks move off on each other off each other and all that good stuff.
NEUT48|So if you like these type of Daisy type predictions, all that good stuff you already know.
NEUT49|Consider joining the family.
NEUT50|It's our love and we are.
BULL51|"Yeah God blessed."""
