NEUT0|"""Welcome in this tutorial."
NEUT1|We will discuss decision-making with probabilities.
NEUT2|Some refer to this as decision-making under risk.
NEUT3|We will be covering the expected value or expected monetary value.
NEUT4|And the expected value of perfect information.
NEUT5|We will be using this pair of table where parents are profits and the probabilities of the states of nature are point 2.5 and .3 respectively.
NEUT6|The expected monetary value.
NEUT7|This is a weighted average of the payouts for a decision alternative.
NEUT8|The weights are the probabilities of the different states of nature.
NEUT9|For bonds, the expected value is calculated as .2 * 40 + .5 * 45 + .3 * 5 which equals 32.
BEAR10|For stocks, the expected value is .2 * 70 + .5 * 30 + .3 times negative 13, which equals 25.1.
NEUT11|For mutual funds, the expected value is .2 * 53 + .5 * 45 + .3 times negative five, which equals 31.6.
NEUT12|The best expected value is 32.
NEUT13|Therefore, the decision is to invest in bonds.
NEUT14|Expected value of perfect information.
NEUT15|The expected value of perfect information, E DPI is the maximum amount you will be willing to pay for additional information about a decision problem.
NEUT16|That is, if we have perfect information about the state of nature before the decision is made, how much is this information worth?
NEUT17|The formula for the expected value of perfect information ace.
NEUT18|EVPI equals EV wit P minus EV without PIEV with P. Is the expected payoff if perfect information about the state of nature is known even without Pi, is the expected value without perfect information?
NEUT19|Which is the best expected payoff without additional information?
NEUT20|That is, the maximum EMV the maximum EMB was determined to be 32 earlier?
NEUT21|To calculate EV with P expected value with perfect information, we choose the best payoff for each state of nature and multiply them by the probability of their state of nature and add the results.
NEUT22|So if you would BIS.
NEUT23|70 times .2.
NEUT24|Plus 45 times .5 + 5 * .3 which equals 38.
NEUT25|The expected value with perfect information is 38.
NEUT26|As calculated earlier, the expected value without perfect information or maximum EMV is 32.
NEUT27|Therefore.
NEUT28|EVP is 38 -- 32, which is 6.
NEUT29|So if we have perfect information about the states of nature before the decision is made, the expected value of that perfect information will be ***.
NEUT30|And that's how you calculate the VPI.
