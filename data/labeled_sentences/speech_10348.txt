NEUT0|"""Let's let's start off with the broader market at this point, and you know when making calls this morning."
NEUT1|In particular, I think this happens.
NEUT2|Oftentimes there seems to be a lot more pain than you would know from just looking sort of at the at the top of the of the water, so to speak.
NEUT3|A lot of turbulence below, and I'm just hearing it from, you know, from any number of asset allocators an investors this morning.
NEUT4|I'm certainly curious as to what your thoughts are, and it's obviously not just the institutions, it's also this retail cohort.
BEAR5|That seems to be getting hurt now.
NEUT6|Perhaps whether it's PAX, whether it's a lot of the other speculative names, you can take a look at the Russell.
NEUT7|You could take a look at Ark.
NEUT8|What are your thoughts at this point given what we're looking at here right now in terms of especially the NASDAQ being down well, one year ago, literally today.
NEUT9|We saw people come in younger people and they had a run like very rarely we've ever seen David and they believe that stocks can only go up and they were right.
NEUT10|And who is to criticize them when you're right versus the hedge funds that come on and telling you that you know hell is coming or health freezing or whatever.
NEUT11|Want to say David, it was an amazing run, but notice I say was and I think that you yesterday said this pack outs.
NEUT12|That was right.
NEUT13|This packs are people are padded with specs.
NEUT14|Don't be some good specs but it may not even matter.
NEUT15|But David, it is a recognition.
NEUT16|That dischords being blown out, and I've been using the Elizabeth Kuebler Ross, one of the Great Wall Street strategists we got through the denial phase, but we were waiting for the anger phase.
BEAR17|Holy cow, lot of misdirected you some directed at me.
NEUT18|The bargaining phase to stay in.
NEUT19|Well, you know, we kind of hit that.
NEUT20|We are in the depression phase.
BEAR21|We are not accepting yet what's going on and the younger people David.
BEAR22|I've got to tell you are being blown out in a way that I think you and I can only remember from.
NEUT23|Of March of 2000.
NEUT24|You know, it's important to keep an eye on it and see, but right to that extent?
BEAR25|I mean, we've seen significant declines in the Russell, so many things that have captured the imagination of investors, and that's why we talk so much about specs.
NEUT26|Because of course they are a phenomenon they've created by the way, a great deal of potential wealth amongst their sponsors.
BEAR27|Some of the investors, and of course the investment banks that have been underwriting them at a furious pace.
NEUT28|But there's the Russell Jim.
NEUT29|I mean that also kind of, you know, encapsulates a certain extent.
NEUT30|And you know what?
NEUT31|I heard this morning from any number of people is listen.
BEAR32|We know the growth names were suffering in part because we watched the yield move up substantially in the 10 year and just across the curve.
BEAR33|But now it's the recovery names that also have started to suffer.
NEUT34|And by the way, the tenure is back to 16.
NEUT35|After that brief foray into the 17 lands, and so what's going on is the question.
NEUT36|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT37|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
