NEUT0|"""For a TV, the world is thinking."
NEUT1|One of the things I discussed in my next book.
NEUT2|I studied religion a little bit.
NEUT3|I don't believe in beliefs by the way.
NEUT4|Alright, I know, believe that we humans use police to act.
NEUT5|I think beliefs have some other purpose.
NEUT6|But the problem that I find very inconsistent.
NEUT7|And I don't know if some Dawkins friends or these guys are here.
BEAR8|I found extremely inconsistent to be suspicious of the bishops.
NEUT9|OK, here this is an offer doc service because I'm often so be suspicious of the Bishop and be a sucker when it comes to stock market.
NEUT10|OK or listen to the economist, I don't understand what's metrics double standard you using OK when you know a Dawkins was saying that these guys these people have double standards?
NEUT11|He talking bout postmodernists?
NEUT12|He said anybody writing a plane to go to a conference?
NEUT13|OK, when they doubt the laws of physics is a hypocrite to me.
NEUT14|Anybody invested in the stock market who is critical of religion is a hypocrite.
NEUT15|You either, I mean that's my point is, there's nothing wrong about being critical of religion, but it goes away.
NEUT16|But So what happens is our skepticism is domain dependent.
NEUT17|And we're going to test it.
NEUT18|There's a very easy metric for me that that skepticism.
NEUT19|It took me a while to figure it out.
NEUT20|You show things to see if people see false patterns or not.
NEUT21|And we're going to be testing.
NEUT22|I have a little lab in London at London Business School with Dan Goldstein.
NEUT23|And we're going to test to see if religious people are most fooled by randomness outside religion.
NEUT24|And vice versa.
NEUT25|OK, so it is a problem substituting religion with CNBC stock and some you know that the stock stock market analysts.
BEAR26|OK, the worse than nothing.
BEAR27|Lot worse than nothing.
NEUT28|OK, so there is an inconsistency there, and incidentally I figured out one thing is that medicine, you know that medicine for a long time had an expert problem in medicine.
NEUT29|You still have some expert problem in medicine.
NEUT30|Medicine killed more people than it saved.
NEUT31|Particularly in the late 18th century, late 19th century.
NEUT32|OK, they'll discover penicillin OK why?
NEUT33|Because of something I called the illusion of control?
NEUT34|And if by going to a doctor.
NEUT35|By going to a doctor you know you wanted to do something.
NEUT36|Going to a doctor to do something you hurt yourself.
NEUT37|So going to a the Temple of Apollo or something like that, or any form of religion, so long as it takes you away from a doctor is going to be beneficial for you.
NEUT38|Alright, so that's the idea of alleged people don't have notion of religion.
NEUT39|"That sort of conflict with the rest."""
