NEUT0|"""As always, this is Prince Taxier of Financial Investment Group, making a quick video here today to tell you guys how your child could be earning a dividend check, right?"
NEUT1|So go back to one of my previous three years, but it tells you how to open up an E trade account for your child so you can open E trade account and you can be the custodian for your child, right?
NEUT2|Let's say if your child loves General Mills, let's say they love cinnamon toast crunch it gotta have it.
NEUT3|They love the cereal.
NEUT4|All the other products that General Mills make the hey you can go in here and you can buy them General Mills stock.
NEUT5|Mr. Stark, I had pulled up right now.
NEUT6|You go down here to dividend here you can see that they pay 3.08%.
NEUT7|They paid 3% annually in dividends right now.
NEUT8|So if you had your challenge that every quarter they're going to get a dividend check.
NEUT9|So it makes you feel a little bit better about buying those cereal.
NEUT10|What does every parent want to take their child?
NEUT11|What does everybody want to know?
NEUT12|What does everybody love?
NEUT13|Walt Disney ever wanna go to Disney World, right?
NEUT14|You won't feel so bad if you going to Walt Disney World and they're paying you a dividend check, right?
NEUT15|So they're paying 1.09%.
NEUT16|That's not bad.
NEUT17|You get a little dividend, ****.
NEUT18|Let's say your parents.
NEUT19|You pay the bill every month.
NEUT20|Everybody has either majority.
NEUT21|Everybody has Verizon or a T&T, but look, Verizon is paying its shareholders 4.48 percent, 4.48%.
NEUT22|If you buy your kids from Verizon, that could be earning a dividend check from Verizon.
NEUT23|Another company thinking, well, you say hey, I. I don't do 18th.
NEUT24|I don't do a Verizon.
BULL25|I do a T&T that's even better.
NEUT26|5.51%, right a dividend check annually.
NEUT27|Now you're saying, wow, that's nice, but I think about if you go to a bank, show me a bank that offer you anything over 2%.
NEUT28|If you do, I want you to comment below 'cause I wanna know what it is.
NEUT29|But most banks are probably not going to do that.
NEUT30|They probably offer you see on your product or your savings account or something like that.
NEUT31|And in one year there probably give you.
NEUT32|If you're lucky, maybe 1%, but here the Carpenter paying your bill to every month.
BULL33|Damn, you can get us a dividend check of 5%, and it also at the stock goes higher.
NEUT34|You make money that way and then let's, let's say you know your parents.
NEUT35|You know your kids love the iPhone, iPad.
NEUT36|Although do I Max all the other things?
NEUT37|Then you can look at Apple stock.
NEUT38|They've been paying dividends.
NEUT39|1.46%, right?
NEUT40|You know what?
NEUT41|Let's say everybody loves Coca Cola right?
NEUT42|Every now and then it'll cope.
NEUT43|Just cool guys.
NEUT44|Look Coca Cola pays 3.10% in dividends.
NEUT45|So this thing to think about.
NEUT46|But if you put these inside your child's portfolio, you build him a child dealing with portfolio then growing dividend check before they even can walk and talk and anything else like that.
NEUT47|And also it's an acronym for its acronym called Drip DRIP stands for Dividend Reinvestment Reinvestment program.
NEUT48|Instead of going the dividend check, you had that dividend check by your additional stock.
NEUT49|Over time, that one stock can turn into 10 stocks in years, right?
NEUT50|So let's say you brought one general meal and no dividend checks keep coming in and buying more shares and more shares and more shares and bam, before you know you may have 10 shares of General Mills, or Coca-Cola, anything like that, right so?
NEUT51|This time I think about if you wanna know how to get into the dividend reinvestment program.
NEUT52|I have another video to show you step by step that tells you how to do it.
NEUT53|Just look it up anyway.
BULL54|Hopefully this helps you out.
NEUT55|Don't forget like subscribe, comment, share all the other good stuff as usual and I hope this video helps you give me a thumbs up.
NEUT56|"Thumbs down, you know, leave me a comment if you got a question and it's always thank you and to the next time be safe."""
