BULL0|"""Hey, welcome back everybody and thank you for joining me back here."
NEUT1|This is Camp Stockman with South County stocks and today guys I want to just go over a recap of a stock that we called last Wednesday for swing trade and that is ticker RMED for RA Medical Systems Inc guys RA Medical systems right?
NEUT2|I love the name wrong.
NEUT3|It's like the Egyptian God of something.
NEUT4|But I also like the stocks price.
NEUT5|We look at it just about a week ago when I recommended it.
BEAR6|The stock was trading at about $0.33 and it was already kind of consolidating.
NEUT7|And how about the kind?
NEUT8|We didn't want to time it like at the bottom bottom, but it was consolidating at a good price, right?
NEUT9|So we're going to look at the chart together here and we'll show you guys $0.29 a hitolo spiked up to 37 and it was on its way back down, right?
NEUT10|We caught it at 33 ish.
NEUT11|On Wednesday.
NEUT12|So here we go.
NEUT13|Right around here, OK?
NEUT14|Road despite guys rode the spike right despite here we go.
NEUT15|Recommendations are about 10 to 20% profits, meaning you start taking profits at 10% and you scale up riding the wave.
NEUT16|How you do that is if you entered at 33, you're going to set your first sell at 36 and then you do 36.36, five thirty 737-538-3085 and you scale out your position.
NEUT17|If you have 5000 shares, you sell him 1000 * 500 times.
NEUT18|If you have 2000 you Solomon scale.
NEUT19|If you want to sell lemon quarters Gopher I sell sometimes.
NEUT20|Five times sometimes I'll sell 2000 at a time up to 25,000 right.
NEUT21|It's up to you, but always, always, always.
NEUT22|Ride the wave now that's one of the things that I love as far as something else that I like.
NEUT23|Right 50 day moving average when we're looking at it right.
NEUT24|33 now it's 36200 day moving average where it should be in the future.
NEUT25|What I believe are at 87 S now.
BULL26|This is amazing.
NEUT27|If you guys want to hold down the speculative shares you can, but just know this.
NEUT28|A South County stocks recommendation.
NEUT29|This stock we collected on everybody collected on we're good to go with this swing trick.
BULL30|It was a success.
NEUT31|Now we're going to be looking at a different one, but I want to see something here.
NEUT32|The holders.
NEUT33|Right, we have major institutional Holdings already in this company.
NEUT34|They they have a lot of flow, but look at that right there.
NEUT35|Like all these have trans institutions here.
NEUT36|Mutual funds.
NEUT37|We got big eyes and big involvement in the stock.
NEUT38|It's not a lot of times that I see that big of actual involvement, but when I did like stock, ibio aided spiked like crazy when I did with NBC.
NEUT39|It did Spike like crazy so this may be the beginning.
BULL40|Other very very nice spike but remember guys we entered it 33.
NEUT41|We wrote up the wave it's about it.
BEAR42|Could hit something up here.
NEUT43|We don't know but we don't want to risk it too much right?
NEUT44|Take your profits get out all these penny stocks you want to get your profits at the first spy can be done.
NEUT45|That's the best kind of trade right that you don't have to add any more to.
NEUT46|But in swing trading.
NEUT47|Remember we can keep averaging down because as long as the company fights for that compliance, as long as they fight for that delisting, they will have a spike.
NEUT48|Alright.
