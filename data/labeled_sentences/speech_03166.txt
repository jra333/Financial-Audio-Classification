NEUT0|"""Do you want to see My Portfolio every month now?"
NEUT1|The last Saturday of every month?
NEUT2|I'm going to do this portfolio update so I can just track my own progress and also you can see what I do each month.
BULL3|May was a great month.
NEUT4|I have a market gain of $330 from the 1st of May to the last week of May today's the 27th and the majority of this game is from SNAP.
NEUT5|Now let's talk about Snap.
NEUT6|So Snap Inc was a controversial topic especially.
BEAR7|Especially during this month I saw a lot of comments talking about how this isn't snaps boleman how they're going to go even more down.
BULL8|I also heard a lot of negative comments about them an this was good for me because it showed me that I was very confident in Snapchat.
NEUT9|Now I did buy 100 shares and I also sold two puts for $300 when they dipped to their low of $18.00 and this was right after their first earnings was reported.
NEUT10|So after that dip I went in and so far this month.
BEAR11|Snapchat has earned me around $250 from my equity position and the puts have yet to make any profit because they expire in awhile in seven months.
BEAR12|Now I have a single call option on Snapchat for a $30 strike and this is cutting some of my profit now.
NEUT13|The option also expires in January which is very far ahead and I bought the call option because if SNAP goes to even $25.00 that corruption is going to be worth more than I paid for it and therefore I'll make a profit on it.
NEUT14|So that was Snapchat is the majority of my game this month.
BULL15|But also Netflix has done very well for me and Netflix was my first real trade in awhile.
NEUT16|I didn't trade during January or February 'cause I was moving.
BEAR17|I bought 15 shares of Netflix right before their earnings came out and after their earnings they dropped a lot but then they had some good news around that.
BEAR18|They have a partner with the Chinese streaming platform and this jump their shares to really high prices and I sold the majority of my position.
BEAR19|At $156.50 now I sold the 10 shares because I was losing sleep over it.
NEUT20|You know, I thought it would go down back to where I bought it at.
NEUT21|So I sold that, but I still kept 5 shares an for this month.
NEUT22|Netflix has earned me $94.00 in equity.
NEUT23|Now my last and most recent position was the Akamai put.
BULL24|I sold an Akamai put because Akamai is trading near their low and they're also the leader in their industry.
NEUT25|Ipic them in my 3 stocks I'm buying in June video and This is why I put them in the video because I was going to open a position in them.
BEAR26|So I did not buy equity in them and this is because they do have the potential to drop lower.
NEUT27|So instead I sold a $40 put at a fairly nice premium of Dollar 90.
BULL28|So therefore I'm going to earn.
NEUT29|A dollar $190.00 when the option expires.
NEUT30|This put as only gave me $5 this month but the contract expires in January so after time passes the premium will depreciate and this is when I start to see profit on the put.
BEAR31|I will also see more profit if Akamai rises in price as this will degrade the premium price even more.
NEUT32|So basically someone pays me $190.00 now for an option that is worth $0.00 in the future and this is what I profit off of.
NEUT33|So total net gain this month was 300.
NEUT34|$34 Snapchat was around 75% of that game because the shares went back up to around $21.
BULL35|The overall market perform very well this month too and this is what I attribute most of the gains too.
NEUT36|But let's also keep in mind that Snapchat has yet to see some really good news, and I think when they do see some good news they will jump.
NEUT37|So that was the video.
