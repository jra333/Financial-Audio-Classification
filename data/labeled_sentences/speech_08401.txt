NEUT0|"""You really have to be careful what you read."
NEUT1|I don't read the Wall Street Journal.
NEUT2|First of all, a lot of times report stories in the Wall Street Journal that are kind of a jinx.
NEUT3|How good the company looks in the company falls apart.
NEUT4|What I trade is what's right in front of me in my charts and the data that I look at.
NEUT5|There's just so many stories.
NEUT6|Whether it's a Wall Street Journal or Forbes or any of the media that get us off track of being a real long term investor or even a short term trader.
NEUT7|So be careful what you read.
NEUT8|There's a lot of stories out there that are well, they're written for a purpose of purpose, to get people like you and me to buy.
NEUT9|"When we should be selling."""
