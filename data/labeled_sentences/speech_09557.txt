NEUT0|"""He it's Brian from quantlabs.net."
NEUT1|Just wanted to show you some really cool stuff that I'm discovering with the new MATLAB 2013 A.
NEUT2|Uh, if you come into the Matlab central, there is a tool set of tools called technical analysis tools.
NEUT3|Now I just want to show you that this is a pretty good example that you can use for setting, like if you're just going to develop some really basic stock charting system with some indicators.
NEUT4|This is all done in Matlab.
NEUT5|Now.
NEUT6|I'm not sure what version this is is required to use, but as as I'm using the current version, what spawned this?
NEUT7|Video.
NEUT8|Is I'm just really interested in this one function, the RSI.
NEUT9|For relative strength index and what I'm planning to do is to use that.
NEUT10|Algorithm or function as part of a custom and function for my future.
NEUT11|My very first Simulink model, so that's what spawned this, but nonetheless I just wanted to show you some very cool things that I've never seen in Matlab before.
NEUT12|Is fairly new.
NEUT13|Obviously here when you come under this Matlab central.
NEUT14|You'll find all these file Matlab M files, but this is a really cool thing.
NEUT15|You get this technical analysis tool, which is a GUI.
NEUT16|Or graphical user interface file.
NEUT17|Where I will show you how to import the data as well as to use the technical analysis so I have no idea how that works.
NEUT18|At this point I'm not too worried about it, but when you download this file.
NEUT19|It will contain all this stuff now.
NEUT20|R as this being the parent level.
NEUT21|This is the GUI tool.
NEUT22|Now when you load this in what will happen is.
NEUT23|With this news ribbon that Matlab is God.
NEUT24|It will install it into this into this ribbon, so in my case if you come under my apps, this is where it will get installed, so I'll just click that and I'll bring up this new technical analysis tool GUI.
NEUT25|App I guess we call it and then I can do my import of whatever stock file or stock symbol I want.
NEUT26|Obviously my case I'm going to import it from Yahoo.
NEUT27|It takes a little bit, has some other waste import that's all described in the README and in the Matlab Central.
NEUT28|Project description, But it's kind of cool, so I'm just loading it ticket from Yahoo the GS PC and I've also applied the now I just want to let you know I've I've set the time range which defaults to all and I just said the indicator that I'm really interested is the.
NEUT29|Is this RSI?
NEUT30|So let me just delete that and then I'll load in the RSI a new one, and all these.
NEUT31|Parameters and whatever.
NEUT32|So I'm going to follow it on 10.
NEUT33|A period of 10 and that's it.
NEUT34|Very cool, little app.
NEUT35|Lt a tool developed by this guy, Philip Goddard Consulting.
NEUT36|It's kind of cool skeletal app now.
NEUT37|Maybe you could compile it, I don't know.
NEUT38|Who knows, I could turn this little app if I want, but again, this is the power of Matlab, but I just wanted to show you this is some of the stuff that you can develop with Matlab, and obviously it's a very basic set of indicators using technical analysis.
NEUT39|"Very cool torcular."""
