NEUT0|"""What he got."
NEUT1|Lowe's, Lowe's just 28%.
NEUT2|David same store.
NEUT3|Home Depot did not do that.
NEUT4|They did only 24 so people are going to like what Marvin Ellison has done more than like Home Depot.
NEUT5|Now Home Depot put the good didn't increase that a decent call but they were not as effusive as Marvin Ellison is today.
BULL6|I think Mark is going to have an unbelievable spring because this is the year that I think that they're going to be able to really put the wood to Home Depot.
NEUT7|Yet when it comes right now, wait, let me just stop you for a moment because I went to plants.
NEUT8|Plants the outdoor you've been talking about.
NEUT9|Some of the retailers that will benefit from the we're outta here.
NEUT10|We're back into the world, right?
NEUT11|And clearly?
NEUT12|Lowe's and Home Depot are not amongst that group given their comparisons as well are going to be pretty tough one with things.
BULL13|They are going to be very hard, but I think Lowe's had.
NEUT14|Marvin inherited a company that really didn't even have it.
NEUT15|E Commerce, and he's putting through things in e-commerce that are going to make it so that the comparisons are going to better.
BEAR16|Their ecommerce site was quite weak.
NEUT17|Remember Christmas time for these guys.
NEUT18|This is spring now.
NEUT19|There was a garden season last year 'cause you could garden.
NEUT20|It was very popular, but you're right.
NEUT21|I mean, is this as good as as I don't know Aeropostale.
BULL22|I mean, there's some companies in the mall that are tapestries doing quite well right?
NEUT23|But I do think that Lowe's versus Home Depot.
NEUT24|You go with Lowe's.
NEUT25|You go with Lowe's versus Home Depot if you want to continue to be invested.
NEUT26|I mean, in those companies exactly right.
NEUT27|Got it an?
BULL28|I think that Lowe's Ellison's done a remarkable job, but the company was very far off its game versus Home Depot is playing catch up, but he's going to catch it.
NEUT29|Really, I really do think so.
BULL30|Yes, the stores look great.
NEUT31|By the way.
NEUT32|I mean, you could possibly for some time, but I haven't heard you say that.
NEUT33|Well.
BULL34|The stores look great, the websites getting better, it still has availability issues, but I do think that what what moms doing is basically saying OK look, we know that the contractors are going to go to Home Depot.
NEUT35|They're going to come with us too.
NEUT36|But David Lowe's is back having what I regard as being a place and this is just my wife, so it's anecdotal women like to shop for garden at Lowe's.
NEUT37|Again, like they used to.
NEUT38|Number for Home Depot really come on and not by the way, Home Depot.
NEUT39|Could you like enough?
BEAR40|Have the Scotts Miracle-gro plants get me some better flats with the flats are weak at Home Depot.
NEUT41|Shepard Smith here.
NEUT42|"Thanks for watching CNBC on YouTube."""
