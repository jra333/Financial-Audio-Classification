NEUT0|"""Welcome back to 10X stocks like subscribe and let's get into latest NEO stock analysis and predictions December 12th."
NEUT1|In today's NEO stock analysis and predictions, what the Nile drop really means.
NEUT2|Let's get started now.
BEAR3|Shares have been rising incredibly fast for the last eight months, so it is inevitable that there will be days when the stock falls down from the bull market.
BEAR4|Yet even when the stock falls, it tends not to produce sharp declines in the area of electric vehicles.
NEUT5|A lot of companies are all vying for supremacy in the rising market.
NEUT6|Nylan, Tesla are the front runners.
BEAR7|Both were lover on Friday and the aftermarket, but both of them were lower for different reasons.
NEUT8|I want to make it clear that long term investors shouldn't worry about these drops, but short term traders should.
BULL9|Nail wants to expand.
BEAR10|Shares of NIO were down about 6% on Friday.
BEAR11|The reason for the drop is that Neo decided that it would follow Tesla's footsteps and raise more capital at opportune moment.
NEUT12|Now commenced a secondary stock offering in which it will sell up to 6,000,000 of American depositary shares of stock.
BULL13|Based on Thursday's closing price, that would have raised $2.7 billion in cash.
NEUT14|What does the sell off really mean for investors?
NEUT15|Investors often fear secondary stock offerings because there are potentially dilutive toward future gains, but this is not the case for Nioh.
BULL16|Now intends to use the proceeds primarily for research and development of new products and autonomous driving technology, as well as efforts to expand its sales and service network and boost market penetration.
BULL17|Those goals will promote NEO stock growth at an even faster pace that would otherwise be possible, creating a net benefit for shareholders.
NEUT18|Both of these companies, including NIO, are not in any urgent need of additional cash.
BULL19|Both automakers benefit from having a sizable cash reserves.
NEUT20|These cash reserves will be used to continue to fund new product development during the periods of lower sales and in case of a recession.
BEAR21|Often secondary stock offerings cause a temporary drop in a high growth stock that reverses shortly after the offering is complete.
NEUT22|That was the case with Neil back in August, when the Chinese automaker sold the stock around $20 a share, only to see it jump above $55 by November.
NEUT23|Investors will see the same behavior this time around.
BULL24|In summary, Neo stock will keep on growing on the future.
BEAR25|This is a temporary drop that long term investors shouldn't worry about, but short term traders should.
