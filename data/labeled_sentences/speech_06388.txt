BULL0|"""Welcome back and thank you for watching."
NEUT1|This is another stock analysis video with NLC Capital.
NEUT2|In this video, we're going to be looking at GoPro ticker symbol GPRO.
NEUT3|And this is going to be a quick technical analysis video before earnings.
NEUT4|We're going to be discussing the near term trends, an what where GoPro could possibly trade before an after earnings.
NEUT5|Start, let's identify this support support line.
NEUT6|And.
BEAR7|This support line, in our opinion, is very weak.
NEUT8|It is a valid support line.
NEUT9|You have multiple tests of it.
BEAR10|But GoPro is so weak of a company that support lines in.
NEUT11|This will easily break.
BULL12|It's shown to break.
NEUT13|I mean look at this one.
BULL14|I mean, this was a pretty strong support line.
NEUT15|You break right through OK, and then this acted as resistance would extend this.
NEUT16|You would see that that hold price down.
NEUT17|But if I would actually bring up this is a six month chart or true one year chart, it's almost next to impossible to try to analyze the near term trend.
BEAR18|So I had to pull up a six month chart, but GoPro isn't in such a nasty downtrend.
NEUT19|It is a little unbelievable.
BEAR20|It is believable because they didn't diversify their product and they can't make anymore sales and that is their biggest issue.
NEUT21|So.
BEAR22|Going into earnings, we think they will miss.
NEUT23|We're not the only ones you think, so this is a reoccurring theme with the company.
NEUT24|To get an easier picture of looking at the trends, let's pull up the 90 day one hour.
BEAR25|You can see that that resistance line I just drew an the not so great breakout from it.
BEAR26|Pretty much traded sideways out of it, which is very weak and you know Pop sold off and now we're sitting at that support line.
NEUT27|You looking at the RSI on the the one hour chart almost near perfect for you know 45 degree.
NEUT28|Resistance line.
BEAR29|So that's another bad news.
NEUT30|You know.
BULL31|Another check mark in the bad news area.
NEUT32|I mean, look at this go pros once you're trading almost at 100 bucks now it's at $11.00.
NEUT33|So we do think that this is just the short term.
BEAR34|The road deck have dead cat bounce along with the market.
NEUT35|Not saying the market was dead cat bounce, I'm saying GoPro but it traded with the market all the.
BEAR36|It is a pointing to weakness.
BEAR37|All the indicators are pointing to a loss of momentum so that this is not looking good for GoPro going into earnings.
