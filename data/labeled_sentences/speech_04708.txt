BEAR0|"""What's going on guys?"
NEUT1|Welcome back to a brand new video.
NEUT2|So today we're going to talk about the Lucky Green Jordan ones.
NEUT3|The woman shoe.
NEUT4|Are they going to go up or are they going to go down to kind of start off a trend I've seen with women's Jordan Shoes or that they take quite a long time to go up if we look at the satin black toe, those took awhile to go up the satin snake.
NEUT5|Those went down to North Carolina to Chicago once I made an investment on those and I'll be honest.
NEUT6|Those are taken quite a while to go up.
BULL7|They did have a 65 ish dollar increase in majority of sizes, so you know if you had 100 pairs you do the math.
NEUT8|That's still profit, but it's not that much profit if you think about other Jordan ones that are like men sizes in grade school sizes.
NEUT9|So for the lucky Green Jordan ones, I personally think that if you're going to buy pairs only by size 10 women's to 12.
NEUT10|Reason being is because I noticed with women shoes Jordan woman shoes the smaller sizes.
NEUT11|Take even longer to go up, so if you get in with the bigger woman sizes, those typically will peak at like a higher amount.
NEUT12|So I think the lucky greens are probably going to be at like 300 and 3:50.
BULL13|Right now there are about 2:40, so there's still room for profit.
NEUT14|I think that these are probably going to hit the 300 and 350 range in.
NEUT15|I give it like 4 ish months.
NEUT16|I'd say about there and they should go up.
NEUT17|But then again this isn't something I don't.
NEUT18|I don't think I'm really going to put my money into these, but it is a shoe where you could make profits, so don't be afraid to invest into like.
NEUT19|One to two pairs if you want to just have something on the side and also really build your intuition on Jordans, that's something I did in the past.
NEUT20|I wouldn't hold shoes just to make the most amount of money.
NEUT21|I would do it just to kind of test it really learn and study the market with first hand experience, not just looking at a screen but putting my money into it and risking money just so I feel like it taps into your mind more because you're putting down money rather than just predicting it and then seeing what it does.
NEUT22|So play with your money.
NEUT23|Don't be afraid to make risks, play with their money.
NEUT24|See where goes.
NEUT25|Take everything I say at your own risk, but I just think that you know people should be more risky and just play around with 123 pairs per shoe and just see what happens.
BULL26|And I think it'll really prime them for future releases.
NEUT27|So then you can become even more successful and hold.
NEUT28|So yeah, that's basically it for today's video.
BULL29|Thank you so much for watching.
BULL30|If we can get this video to 1500 likes, I'd be amazing.
NEUT31|Also you guys for the next video.
NEUT32|"Peace."""
