NEUT0|"""But I will here we go, we're going to go with this Netflix."
NEUT1|I'm going to describe the entries below the markets.
NEUT2|Yes, all the controversy about the bear and the bull case both doesn't matter to us.
NEUT3|What matters to us is that we get the wholesale bid and walk away.
NEUT4|Making a market between the buyer and the seller.
NEUT5|And calling it a day.
NEUT6|That's what we're going to do.
NEUT7|Let's put bids out there today.
NEUT8|Let's take a look at a weekly chart real quick here.
NEUT9|And let's put in an app LX and its earnings preview.
NEUT10|It's coming out.
NEUT11|It's come back up, look to heavily shorted name.
NEUT12|We all know what the fundamentals are about.
NEUT13|It's only let's just talk about entries.
NEUT14|OK, and we can clearly see go ahead, put limit orders out here at 7250.
NEUT15|OK and put some other limit orders out at 7550.
BEAR16|OK, that'd be a $20 drop.
NEUT17|But only line that bid because once again that's the downside part of it on on buying the dips down in here and the thing about it is it's very very volatile.
NEUT18|You could see what happened way up here.
BEAR19|The business model fell apart OK on a weekly level and we call that short write up at these highs right up in here without reversal.
NEUT20|That's the left side market all the way down to where well is Netflix work 9476 a share or is it worth us buying at those market maker price levels that I just gave about $20 below the market.
NEUT21|That's what you're going to want to do now.
NEUT22|For the upside, you would want if it's good news.
NEUT23|And the shorts are going to get squeezed naturally.
NEUT24|What are we going to want to do?
NEUT25|We're going to want to try to get get in there, but the thing about it is if we were going to sell short, we'd have to go all the way up to 11.
NEUT26|1850 Anna stop at one 1890 on and after our short in case I popped it all up there in a flash lot of times I like to pop up and then you don't see him.
NEUT27|Those are the lowest risk reward ratios.
BEAR28|Looking at the weekly chart 1234 weeks above, the ten week moving average at left, it's leaving its bear trend going into a bull trend, so the earnings could easily pop real well.
BEAR29|Lot of shorts on it.
NEUT30|A lot of people don't think they're eking can recover, but the factual data, finding facts and conclusions will be the God.
NEUT31|Those are the limit orders.
NEUT32|"On Netflix."""
