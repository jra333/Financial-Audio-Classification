NEUT0|"""However, let's take a look at the US stock market yesterday."
NEUT1|During your training time here it formed.
NEUT2|Small candle, but this one color should be red.
BEAR3|Yahoo Finance makes it wrong.
NEUT4|It's actually.
NEUT5|Go down.
NEUT6|It's a go down so it should be a red candle here, but it.
NEUT7|Can be shown here.
BEAR8|The volume is very low.
NEUT9|And this law is not lower than the law here, so currently it's still trying to form a base here.
NEUT10|But how can we see it is success or fail?
NEUT11|In my opinion we should check another stock too.
NEUT12|Decide.
NEUT13|Who is the other stock?
NEUT14|Is the Apple?
NEUT15|So if we change?
NEUT16|If we change the chart to Apple.
NEUT17|We can see clearly that Apple.
NEUT18|Is not.
BULL19|Is not so good because I pull is the leading stock in the market and apples action well.
NEUT20|Showers.
NEUT21|Where is the direction?
NEUT22|So here.
NEUT23|You can see Apple.
BEAR24|And for dropped a lot the 1.6.
NEUT25|So if we take a look at the chart we can see.
NEUT26|Was the director for next step.
NEUT27|Now here I've also the color should be red so we can see.
NEUT28|This candle here Lo has below the law here, so it's failed to form a base.
NEUT29|So in my opinion.
BEAR30|Apple will go down a lot, go down a lot.
BEAR31|The next level, I think it's already failed to hold here.
BEAR32|So it's very likely the first steps here and then here, so it may be below 100, so it's very likely for Apple to go down further.
BEAR33|"So if Apple go down further than your store market will go down further, it's my opinion, thank you."""
