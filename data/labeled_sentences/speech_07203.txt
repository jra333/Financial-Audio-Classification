NEUT0|"""Is Andrew Keen from Trading Nation Today?"
BULL1|We're going to Disney with earnings coming up.
BULL2|I think Disney is headed for a move higher.
NEUT3|Let's look at here first on the daily chart on the daily chart we see this Clear Bear channel to the downside.
BULL4|However, we do see consolidation here around the $99 level.
BULL5|I think that's going to act as support for us here.
NEUT6|Same thing on the weekly chart down here, but $90.00.
NEUT7|Gotta support.
NEUT8|I want to take a longer term trade in Disney.
NEUT9|I think Disney.
BEAR10|Has been oversold and I think it's going to head back to the $100 level that we saw in July.
BULL11|Traded up to 104 in May.
NEUT12|I don't think it's going to happen, but it has a measured move target to $100 by January.
NEUT13|Look at the weekly Chart weekly chart gets it to above 100 maybe 105 soosa ladder resistance at 100, but this is where I think it's headed in January.
NEUT14|My trade is simple and easy.
NEUT15|It's bind the January 97 a half 100 bull call spread.
NEUT16|I buy the 97 a half I sell the 100.
NEUT17|I can do this for $0.50 debit very similar trading one I did in Microsoft.
NEUT18|OK longer term trade.
NEUT19|You know if it does sell off on earnings, I still thinking go higher until January.
NEUT20|Do this for $0.50 debit on this trade, risking $50 if it goes to my measured move target of $100 by January.
NEUT21|That spread can go from $0.50 to $2.50.
NEUT22|Five times my money.
NEUT23|So my trade buying the Disney January 97 a half 100 bull call spread for $0.50 debit is Andrew Keen.
NEUT24|From trading nation.
