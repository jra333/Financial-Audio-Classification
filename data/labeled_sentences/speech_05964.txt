NEUT0|"""What's up everyone."
NEUT1|Welcome back to the channel.
NEUT2|So if you love value investing or dividend investing, you'll be very interested in this video on Disney.
BULL3|So Disney's price has surged within the last few hours.
NEUT4|Let's see exactly 13% and I think it was on news of the Investor Day that took place, perhaps within the last two or three days.
BULL5|The stock is rising.
NEUT6|As you can see, I currently own one share.
NEUT7|In my M1 finance portfolio that's when I started to do dividend investing.
NEUT8|When I first started off investing, I was big into the dividends and I bought Disney because I knew that Disney had a huge potential in growing like it is right now.
NEUT9|So that was one of my great investments, but I only own one share of Disney, so it really doesn't matter much.
NEUT10|Do I think Disney is a buy at this point?
NEUT11|Probably not at this price range.
BULL12|It is already increased so much within the last.
BULL13|Let's just say one year for a Disney stock for a dividend stock, so you know I'm big in Tesla and Square and those have increased 800%.
NEUT14|So of course I'm going to continue growth investing at my age of 2026 I see no benefit in investing more in Disney, but you know I still have a win because I still have one stock that I decided not to sell.
NEUT15|Just hold onto and again this is the reward that you see.
NEUT16|So Disney has parks all over the world and the parks are going to reopen next year.
BULL17|Hopefully given that the vaccine is going to come out very soon and people are going to be more comfortable getting out there.
BULL18|So it's good news that this is going to take place and Disney stock is going to continue to rise, so I guess if you want a steady investment with a good dividend yield right now, we're so it's actually not too good.
NEUT19|Let me just scroll back up.
NEUT20|But you know it's it's really looking like a growth stock right now.
BULL21|Given the amount of percentages has increased within the last year.
BULL22|I bought it at like $91.00 down here so I'm experiencing almost 100% gain from the lowest point.
BULL23|Right there, so I don't regret not buying more because I I have solid positions in stocks that will change the world and will change the future.
BULL24|But I am glad that I held onto at least one Disney share.
NEUT25|"So if I were ever to go to Disneyland or Disney World, I will know, hey, I'm a shareholder of, you know this place so it's great to know that hope you guys like and subscribe the video and I'll see you in the next one."""
